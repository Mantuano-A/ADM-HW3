    Akage no Anne doesn’t seem to be a particularly grand story if one was to simply read the blurb - there are no dramatic plot twists, no tyrants to defeat, no epic quest spanning galaxies - it is just a very simple tale of a young orphaned girl coming to terms with herself and others. <br />
<br />
Akage no Anne takes place in the late nineteenth century, in the fictional town of Avonlea on Prince Edwards Island, Canada. Here siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both reaching into their 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s, are looking to adopt a boy of around 10 to help them with the farm work.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81104">
        The story begins with the very shy and soft-spoken Matthew  heading towards the train station to pick up their new adopted boy, averting his eyes from every women he passes along the way. However, when Matthew arrives at the train station there is no boy to be found. Instead there is a freckled 11 year old girl with red hair, named Anne Shirley. <br />

It is through this deceptively simple premise that Akage no Anne explores the many complex issues that arise during everyday life, with remarkable results. The broad scope in which it paints these complex themes is rather unassuming at first, but through the slow, naturalistic building of its large cast of characters and nuanced examination of the whys and wherefores of everyday life, Akage no Anne manages to achieve a magic that absolutely deserves to be experienced.<br />
<br />
Anne, like many 11 year-olds, is a very flawed individual. She is obstinate, talks incessantly, and is very easily distracted. Her mood swings wildly from one moment to the next and she frequently prioritizes her latest whim over what really needs to be done. For years she carries an obdurate hatred of a certain character simply because he teased her once. Yet these are hardly the deplorable characteristics they may seem at first; rather, they are what makes her such a human character and, in turn, such a relatable one as well. Humans are naturally flawed beings and Anne is no exception. Nevertheless, these imperfections are hardly the unidimensional character traits one may have become accustomed to in anime. Her wild mood swings denotes her uniquely passionate temperament for the dramatic and the romantic. Distractions are often for the sake of more creative endeavors. Her whimsy is a large part of what makes her such an endearing character, both to those around her and the audience. Whenever Anne is given the chance to learn or experience something new, she always takes to the task with a great sense of purpose. All of these points considered, Anne is an incredibly realistic and human character, and you can&#039;t help but relate to her because of that.<br />
<br />
And true to real life, Anne&#039;s depth of characterization, and rationalization of this characterization, takes root in the detailings of her past. Both of her parents died of typhoid fever when she was only three months of age. She was then placed into the care of the very poor Thomas family, only to be sent to live with the Hammond family and subsequently sent to an orphanage at an even later date. Throughout these early years of her life, she was often unfairly berated and forced to toil away at household chores day in and day out, never permitted to attend school or make any friends. It is through these harsh formative years that Anne&#039;s personality had already begun taking shape. She sought refuge from her unfavorable living conditions by escaping into stories, poems, books and her characteristic vivid imagination. The books and poems she had read established her penchant for theatrics and her lyrical soliloquies early on. She was never given the chance to experience many of the things the world has to offer, so she had to fill in the blanks of life with her imagination. Her imagination could also be seen as her only tool of contending with these tribulations by way of envisioning her standings in life as a much more extravagant, romantic one.<br />
<br />
Most of this, however, isn&#039;t disclosed quite this explicitly in the actual show. Yes, Anne does go into her history briefly, but not in such great detail, and she certainly doesn’t dissect her past crucibles and their innate effect on her psyche; all of that is merely implicit. The writing at play here omits any superfluous details or things that can be easily ascertained by the attentive viewer/reader in favor of a more realistic approach of characterization. Things aren&#039;t learned by means of awkward expository dialogue, nor are they dictated via haphazard, unwieldy info-dumps - everything is simply conveyed to the audience in a very candid and natural manner, as if we were only peeking in on a small slice of their lives never intended for such a large audience. For instance, Anne’s compendious and slightly hesitant admission that her former caretakers “meant to be good to her” effortlessly says so much more about Anne than a more typical and unnaturally overt explanation of the same thing could ever accomplish. This graceful method of storytelling feels refreshingly alien in today’s modern anime landscape; the narrative is there for our exploring and Akage no Anne’s narrative is a very, very gratifying place to explore, start to finish. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the show wastes little time in establishing some of its interesting character dynamics. Matthew is almost instantly charmed by Anne upon meeting her and doesn&#039;t have the heart to tell her that they had asked for a boy. He’d rather leave that for Marilla to sort out. On the way to Green Gables, Anne recites these sprawling, melodramatic, nearly poetic speeches while Matthew just listens, enraptured. Anne&#039;s fanciful monologues serve as a perfect introduction to her unique world view: She details how much she hates her red hair, her love of romanticism, and how lovely it is to finally have a place she can call home, all the while frequently and impulsively changing the topic to whatever else catches her fancy at that exact fleeting moment. Although Matthew doesn&#039;t speak much during this carriage ride, his expressive face says more than words could ever say. It&#039;s an absolute delight to see how rapt he hangs on Anne’s every word and how quickly he becomes attached to this unusual little girl during their relatively short carriage ride home together when only moments earlier he was averting his eyes in fear in the passing of a few harmless women alongside the road. The effect is very understated but pulled off remarkably well. Thankfully, one can expect many more moments like this throughout the show. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Marilla, a much more pragmatic person than Matthew, isn&#039;t as keen on the idea of keeping Anne, initially. After all, the reason they wanted to adopt a kid in the first place was for help tending the farm, and the skinny Anne hardly seems fit for the job. Furthermore, Anne’s loud, dramatic, fanciful character is the polar opposite of the more subdued and sensible Marilla, so her idiosyncrasies are met with reproach at first. Still, after some careful deliberation following Anne and Marilla having shared a few bonding opportunities, it is decided that Marilla and Matthew will allow Anne to stay at Green Gables and Marilla would raise Anne as her daughter. Akage no Anne remains very much about Anne&#039;s coming of age, but the way the story accomplishes this is through a series of vignettes portraying the ups and downs of her everyday life. For the first time in her life, she is allowed to truly experience life and all that entails: going to school, making friends, and experiencing all the exciting little things in life that we might have come to consider mundane, making all the mistakes that children tend to make along the way. The way Anne grows from these experiences, though, is so natural, gradual, and nuanced that it can be easy to miss entirely until its climax creeps up on the viewer. The final moments of this series are so rewarding, so moving, so poignant in its magnificently understated beauty; all of these seemingly disparate and insignificant moments in Anne&#039;s life coalesce and culminate in ways that make each and every one of said vignettes at once meaningful, evoking a palpable warmth that could only have been achieved in this slow, naturalistic method of storytelling that Akage no Anne pulls off so well.<br />
<br />
Still, this wealth of narrative excellence would all be for naught if just one of the nuts and bolts working behind the scenes were to fall out of place. A story can and will go to pieces if the pacing is just slightly off, so good storyboarding is vital. Scenes that were emotionally gripping or heartrending in the novel can be met with blasé dispassion if it that particular scene isn’t interpreted properly by the screenwriter and director. Skillful voice acting is absolutely integral in conveying the vast breadth of emotion present in this character driven story. Even the smallest oversight in the consistency in the setting can completely take a viewer out of the immersive quality. Storyboarding, screenwriting, direction, voice acting, music, art direction, and, especially in the case of Akage no Anne, a well researched setting are all integral apportioned components of a larger whole. If just one of those cogs isn’t working in perfect accordance with the rest, then the narrative, no matter how excellent, can falter irreparably into an inefficacious mess. It is fortunate, then, that Akage no Anne is every bit as exemplary technically as it is narratively. <br />
<br />
As I see it, the reason that the novel upon which Akage no Anne is based on, &#039;Anne of Green Gables&#039; by Lucy Maud Montgomery, has resonated with so many people around the world for over a hundred years now is in no small part due to its decidedly realistic approach of depicting the magic of everyday life. Isao Takahata, the director of Akage no Anne, is able to capture this magic brilliantly. The direction on display here is nothing short of awe-inspiring. While it would have been incredibly easy for Takahata to indulge in schmaltz or cheap melodramatics, the anime in adaptation never falls into emotional trickery or manipulation of the audience, despite Anne&#039;s habitually melodramatic disposition. Emotional moments are felt because they are genuinely emotional. Through the show’s slow and realistic pacing, we, the audience, grow to love the characters, cherish their bonds, and partake vicariously through their hardships and triumphs just as Anne and her new family do, very naturally. The way Takahata brings Anne&#039;s tribulations to life are easy to relate to precisely by the virtue of how inherently human every single aspect of them is and how informally they all play out. It doesn&#039;t matter where you are from, nor which era you are a part of, because everyone has felt the things Anne feels, and, in one way or another, experienced the same things Anne has. That kind of timeless, all-encompassing humanity has to be admired, and to that effect, so does Isao Takahata for capturing it.<br />
<br />
It is, however, when the predominantly realistic tone gives way to the expressionistic reverie of Anne&#039;s imagination that Takahata’s artistry undoubtedly shines brightest. A brief carriage ride through a wooded path seamlessly metamorphosizes into a magical scene in which Anne is in an instant wearing a long, white dress, being lifted up into the sky by a geyser of flowers while this wondrous, fanciful orchestral tune plays; it&#039;s an absolutely stunning way of putting us directly into Anne&#039;s otherworldly fantasies. Anne&#039;s imagination is so fundamental to who she is that it only makes sense for Takahata to bring her thoughts to life existentially just as Anne envisions them. This extraordinary contrast between realism and expressionism is something that Takahata really excels at, and this motif of his has never had more suitable home to lay its proverbial hat than the in world of Akage no Anne.<br />
<br />
The accuracy with which Montgomery&#039;s text is transformed into this dazzling piece of animation is without comparison. Takahata&#039;s flourishes aside, Akage no Anne is an almost word for word, gesture for gesture, scene for scene adaptation. The setting is well researched and just as described in the novel, with its scenic background art done in a lovely picturesque painterly effect. Hayao Miyazaki handles the scene setting and layout. Yoshifumi Kondo, who would later go on to direct the classic Whisper of the Heart, handles the simple yet serviceable character design that, as with just about everything else, is very accurate to the source material. Animation direction is handled by Kondo and if there is any weak link in Akage no Anne, animation is probably it. The show was made in 1979 and it shows, especially in some of the later episodes. It’s largely to be expected and never becomes too distracting, but it bore mentioning. Music is another area where it would have been incredibly easy for it to succumb to the pitfalls of cloying melodrama, but it’s fairly restrained, yet coolly affecting and melancholy when need be. Anne is a near inimitable character so Eiko Yamada’s spectacular interpretation of her is especially praiseworthy.<br />
<br />
Still, there are several minor dis-similarities between the novel and anime, but outside of a few conspicuous omissions, I’m pleased to report that most of the changes were for the better. Akage no Anne makes incredible use of all fifty of its episodes, so some important character relationships are better fleshed out and a key part of Anne&#039;s life is given more care and attention than in the novel thanks to the anime’s lengthy run time. It’s such a rarity for an adaptation to even come close to equaling the quality of it’s source material, so the fact that Akage no Anne manages to by and large improve upon it’s source without losing an ounce of its magic merits special praise indeed, especially considering the prestigious stature of the Anne of Green Gables novel.<br />
<br />
And everything comes together splendidly; each one of the aforementioned formal cogs amalgamate flawlessly with each other and with Montgomery’s already outstanding writing to form something truly timeless and deserving of being called a masterpiece. I&#039;ve stressed humanity so much in this review because, ultimately, I think that’s what has made Akage no Anne resonate with such a large number of people around the world for so many years now. Its lasting popularity in modern day Japan - a place and time that couldn’t be further from nineteenth century Prince Edward Island, Canada - is a testament to this. Just as Anne had a profound effect upon the lives of those around her, she has truly had a similarly profound effect upon the lives of people around the world for generations upon generations now, and I imagine she will continue to do so for many more; and just that is Anne&#039;s greatest magic. <br />

    The year is 1876 and the Second Industrial Revolution is at its dawn. The world was only a few years away from witnessing the wonders of electricity. Countless technological innovations in the industry, in an ever-growing scheme, are slowly shaping a whole new spectrum of efficient and flexible methods of production. In order to satiate a ravenous hunger for power and resources, Europe&#039;s Imperialistic giants once again turn their eyes towards the vast lands of Africa and Asia. <br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, in Prince Edward Island, Canada; life follows its course as if unaware of the changes around the globe. Rural lifestyles without much commotion characterize the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114801">
        people of Avonlea, a fictional town that the characters of this story call home. Somewhere in town, Matthew Cuthbert is heading out in his carriage for a rare appearance outdoors. It turns out a male orphan was adopted, and the grizzled man was on his way to pick up the boy at the train station. In the days of old, the idea of raising an unknown child was frowned upon by many on account of the risks that came along with it. But Matthew&#039;s younger sister, Marilla Cuthbert, understands that change is necessary. As years went by, the ceaseless march of time began to slowly take its toll on the elder&#039;s body, which is with each passing day having more and more difficulties in dealing with the heavy workload of the farm. But now, with an easier lifestyle guaranteed, the closing stages of Matthew&#039;s journey seem certain to follow a calm final course. However, as he approaches the station, some sort of grave mistake seems to have occurred. Why, for what sort of reason is there a red-haired girl instead of a boy waiting for his arrival…?<br />
 <br />
And thus begins the coming of age story of Anne Shirley of Green Gables. An orphan since her infancy, Anne wandered from place to place for most of her life without the care of a true family. Due to this precarious lifestyle, an intense longing for a place to call home grew with the passing of time. With almost no one to rely on or receive a proper upbringing from, she would often find solace in the world of books and her imagination as means to keep herself in high spirits. As a form of escapism, Anne&#039;s love for literature and the imaginary would slowly begin to mold her dynamic and radiant persona. <br />
 <br />
The child who arrived at Green Gables, though only eleven years old, was more mature than her age would suggest. Anne&#039;s early childhood, while truly difficult, contributed to developing a certain degree of self-dependence. Often under emotional pressure and dealing with heavy workloads, she was forced to adapt to the conditions imposed by the unfavorable environment. But beyond that, they also created a deep sense of humility and inner strength within her—rather than becoming downhearted, Anne learned to find happiness amidst pain. As someone able to enjoy the littlest things in life, even an ordinary day feels splendid to her. Despite showing slight signs of vanity, this immense gratitude towards the world is what keeps Anne from being a spoilt and selfish child. In face of this, Marilla, even if entirely against the idea of adoption at first, slowly develops a profound appreciation for the girl&#039;s sincerity and gumption.<br />
 <br />
Anne&#039;s subsequent endeavors, through honest mistakes and awkward scrapes, are both genuine and amusing, playing an essential role in her growth as a person. Intertwined with her coming of age, various branches explore the cracks and corners of childhood. Be it with the little girl who longs for life-long friendships, or the diligent student who strives for excellence in every undertaken task, or the matured teenager who is conflicted due to the bigger responsibilities that come with age; there&#039;s always aspects one can easily relate to. With each passing episode, the viewer gradually gets to know more about the apprehensions, aspirations and fancies that inhabit the young protagonist&#039;s mind. And in similar pace, the audience witnesses the flow of time that so pervades human life.<br />
 <br />
Time: an ever-changing and constant stream of events that shapes and changes everything around civilization, from the world&#039;s landscapes and oceans to a person&#039;s personality and appearance. In the same manner that it brings good things, it also takes away. In Akage no Anne, this concept is conveyed through Anne&#039;s growth and the changes within the environment after her arrival. Conceptually, the very premise of the story is rooted deep in the notion that life is subject to time and chance. Matthew, who&#039;s in his sixties, is with each passing day showing more symptoms of age, and he is no longer is able to keep up with the tiring farm work as he once did. Marilla, although still not short of vigor, is already past the midpoint of her life&#039;s journey, and her eyes no longer work as well as in the past. Ever since the siblings&#039; parents died, only the two of them have been living in the house, and as they grew older and older, the place took on a silent and solemn atmosphere. The orphan&#039;s arrival at their abode, however, marks the beginning of a new era. Anne&#039;s grateful and vivacious nature brings a vitality and color long lost in the house, acting as a catalyst for mutual growth between the residents that gradually starts resembling that of a unified family. <br />
 <br />
However, witnessing the heartfelt relationship between Anne, Matthew and Marilla as they grow together as a family and deal with the tribulations of life is only part of the journey. Beyond the basic premise, Akage no Anne is a subtle yet insightful look into the etiquettes, norms and principles that form the foundation for the identity of the inhabitants of Avonlea. Similarly to the home environment, institutions like school play a critical role in shaping the mindsets of people. Understated in nature, this theme is explored simply through the daily doings and interactions of the cast—something easily discerned by an attentive viewing. <br />
 <br />
Under Marilla&#039;s supervision, Anne is taught important societal norms and values. Being a woman whose entire life was built around a set of principles, her main objective is to thoroughly instill these values into Anne. The child&#039;s constant lack of concentration and understanding of social norms is seen by Marilla as a big problem that needs fixing. However, contrary to her stern image, the 52-year-old doesn&#039;t adopt a needlessly stringent method of teaching, instead allowing Anne to experience a joyful childhood free of unnecessary restrictions. <br />
 <br />
Considering the importance of education in the story&#039;s context, school is seen as an integral part of the community&#039;s culture and one&#039;s development. Fairly unfamiliar to Anne prior to coming to Green Gables, school becomes a pivotal environment in her growth as a young girl. A nurturing place of learning, it is in there where Anne&#039;s mind flourishes intellectually. It wouldn&#039;t be an exaggeration to say that Anne&#039;s teacher, Mrs. Stacy, was a godsend to her. Being one of the very few adults to ever encourage the girl&#039;s creative mind and intense use of imagination, she becomes an invaluable role model for the impressionable Anne. Of immense importance over time, school opens a multitude of doors for the diligent student. But among everything, the greatest thing it awarded was an important goal in life: the possibility of attending college and graduating.<br />
 <br />
Anne&#039;s process of maturation—subtly perceptible in its early stage, and immense in the long run—is slow and nuanced. As life unfolds, Anne gains size, becomes more self-dependent and responsible, prioritizes more &#039;grown-up&#039; activities, and develops more lady-like manners. She starts becoming more of a socially respectable person, blossoming into a teenager with a number of aspirations... <br />
 <br />
And so the little Anne grows up. The talkative redhead who used to constantly indulge in her flights of fancy and get into the most unusual situations, experiences a new stage in life where ambitions and life goals reside. However, her worldview, albeit more seasoned, remains fundamentally the same. Anne&#039;s gratitude for the smallest of things in life and her explosive imagination are inherent qualities, and will remain ingrained in her psyche for as long as she lives. As the protagonist herself says later in the story, even if grown up physically and mentally, the vivid and imaginative little Anne will always be there. And this, indeed, is what makes Anne Shirley such an extraordinary personality.<br />
 <br />
Subtle too, is the way how Marilla, through the daily contact with Anne, begins to cultivate a maternal sense dormant within her dutiful shell. The rigid and stern house-owner gradually gives way to a more lenient and mellow person. However, Anne has also changed. When the once hard-hearted woman is confronted with the matured teenager, reality hits like a rock. The overemotional and talkative Anne she once learned to love vanishes, and gives place to a self-composed youngster. Despite still loving the girl as much as when she was just a little child, Marilla finds herself unable to shrug off this queer, sorrowful sense of loss. Life never stops moving forward, and sooner or later, everyone stands at the crossroads of life, and what is loved won&#039;t be around anymore. Seemingly simple at first glance, it is quotidian situations like this in Akage no Anne that most richly convey the nuances of human life. The more grown-up Anne embodies the transition between childhood and adolescence, and all the small joys and little mistakes that molded her into a stronger person for the first time demonstrate their true significance. Marilla&#039;s conflicting, bittersweet emotions illustrate not only the reluctance of a parent seeing their child moving into a new life stage, losing some of the innocent charm in the process, but one who wholeheartedly embraces the blossoming youth. Here, it is displayed the natural method through which Akage no Anne&#039;s narrative conveys introspection and character development. In this case, the build-up started back in the very moment when Anne made her way into Green Gables, culminating with substantial personal and interpersonal developments within the family. <br />
 <br />
The resplendent mosaic of Akage no Anne—solid in its individual pieces, brilliant in its entirety—is proof that even the simplest concepts can be assembled together in order to create something truly masterful. All serving a common purpose, both the small and big pieces of Anne&#039;s life story mean something in the grand scheme of things, coalescing into a cohesive whole that is undoubtedly far greater than the sum of the parts. The laid-back storytelling, as if inviting the audience to experience the lives of the characters, is slow and meticulous in exploring the trivialities and intricacies of daily life—it is a casual, and above everything, sincere method of characterization and development of themes that go beyond time and place. The unfolding of the cast&#039;s lives and routines is the form by which Akage no Anne&#039;s storytelling so naturally conveys its messages. Through the slow build-up of routine, the audience truly gets to know Anne, those closely related to her, their individual worlds, and how they change and mold each other through the passing of time. They are dynamic personalities, and more importantly, something more than mere narrative devices. And this, consequently, is what makes Akage no Anne&#039;s cast so believably human through their joys and struggles, and its themes so universal. People grow, people live, and people change. And so does Green Gables and its residents.

    The &quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot; version of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; turns the book into a comprehensive fifty-episode series, absolutely the best adaptation ever made.  Anne Shirley is a red-headed orphan girl who talks too much, has a big imagination, and gets herself into all sorts of trouble.  When a mistake places her in the care of elderly siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert at Green Gables in the the town of Avonlea, she inspires a lot of headaches, but also becomes a vital piece of their family.  <br />
<br />
Directed by Isao Takahata in his pre-Ghibli days, and staffed by plenty of other familiar names

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20354">
        (Miyazaki boarded the first fifteen episodes, Kondo designed the characters), the production is incredibly lavish.  I&#039;ve never seen this amount of well-researched historical detail in any other anime series - the crew actually went to Prince Edward Island to study the architecture and natural scenery - and the resulting visuals are breathtaking.  Though it has its bumps, dull stretches, and odd quirks, this is a classic in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
A long series like this is the best format for literary classics, because they&#039;re often slow paced and episodic.  In the case of &quot;Anne,&quot; this means there&#039;s plenty of room for all of her adventures, not just the famous ones.  Anne still walks a ridgepole, renames half the town&#039;s landmarks, and mistakenly dyes her hair green, but we also get to watch her grow up from a scatterbrained eleven-year-old to a formidable young woman, who has to face some very tough decisions.  The creators were absolutely faithful to the book, to the point of using chapter titles for many episodes, and even fleshed out the ending a bit more than the original.  Best of all, despite its age, &quot;Anne&quot; is easily as watchable and wonderful as it was a generation ago.<br />

    Anime producers should just take classic literature and make a show for every story, because this rendition of the classic book by L.M. Montgomery was spot on. It is by far the best adaptation of the book that I&#039;ve seen, and I only wish they had continued to make a series for the next couple of books about the beloved red-haired orphan girl. <br />
<br />
While the artwork is kind of plain compared to a lot of shows today, everything is neat, friendly to the  eyes, colorful and seemingly accurate historically wise. This is a period piece, so that is important.<br />
<br />
And what can I say about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198604">
        the characters? They are beloved figures from a beloved classic children&#039;s tale. Anne is unique and lovable, Marilla is stern but wise and tender-hearted, Matthew is precious, Mrs. Lynde is her typical gossiping but kind self, and Anne&#039;s friend Diana is completely adorable.<br />
<br />
For any fan of Anne of Green Gables, this is totally worth a sit through, and honestly, it should be shown in schools if teachers are teaching this book to their kids. Hey, they can do a little subtitle reading. They&#039;ll be fine.

    I can&#039;t recommend this show enough especially to slice of life fans. This anime is wholesome, sweet, cute, charming, endearing and something that I hold more dear to me than almost every other anime I&#039;ve seen. To watch how well they portrayed Anne grow as a character through out the show was simply a delight. To watch the relationships that anne makes with other characters through out the show (particularly mathew) also grow was just pure pleasure. Not to mention that the background art is beautiful and the soundtrack makes you feel light and happy enough that you could be whisked away. My only gripe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373929">
        with the show (other than a few slight animation errors here and there) was that they didn&#039;t continue animating more of the books. I recommend watching this an hour a night until the last 6 eps which you should watch all at once.

    Akage no Anne otherwise known as Anne of Green Gables is a 50 episode slice of life directed by both Isao Takahata (Tale of Princess Kaguya) and Koshi Shigeo. Hayao Miyazaki also worked on this show. He did the layout for it.<br />
<br />
Akage no Anne is an adaptation of the novel Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery. It was aired on something called Sekai Meisaku Gekijō (World Masterpiece Theater) which is a Japanese TV anime staple that showcased an animated version of a different classical book or story.<br />
<br />
Akage no Anne is the story of an 11-year-old orphan girl with a vast imagination and short temper.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252846">
        She ends up being taken into the Cuthbert house in Avonlea. Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert originally wanted to adopt a boy to help Matthew out on the farm, but they got sent Anne Shirley by a mistake, but they decided to keep her anyway, even though they do not officially adopt her. The show follows Anne from when she is 11 years old, until she is 17 years old.<br />
<br />
I am a big fan of coming of age stories. It is why Aria is my favorite anime. This show is yet another coming of age story that I really enjoyed. Seeing Anne grow up and having to face everything life could throw at her was quite the ride. It was nice and relaxing when it wanted to, but the show could also really hit you like a brick. The music was good and really fit the show, and the animation was ok for the most part. It was not incredible, but it never really needed to. It did have a few moments where the animation was not at its best, but this is also a 50 episode long show, so it is not a huge surprise. I do however have to give a huge shoutout to the backgrounds. The backgrounds were completely painted with watercolor, and they looked absolutely fantastic. I just wanna frame them and put them on my wall.<br />
<br />
Akage no Anne was the second best show I have watched from the 70s. The way the show portrayed how bonds were forming between Anne, Marilla and Matthew was just fantastic. It also did a really good job showcasing how Anne grew, not just physically, but also mentally. She became more independent and mature. Akage no Anne is honestly one of the best coming of age stories I have seen.
