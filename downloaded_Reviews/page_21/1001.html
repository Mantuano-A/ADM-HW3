    When I tell people to watch this show, they tend to brush it off because it&#039;s an idol anime. Because they think it&#039;s going to be typical reverse harem show. Then I get them to watch just the first two episodes and then they&#039;re addicted.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
It&#039;s not the usual &quot;I have talent, I&#039;m going to be an idol&quot; plotline. Rather, nothing actually goes smoothly for these precious boys. The story likes to throw a lot of stuff at you and then only solve a few of the questions you have. It&#039;s kind of frustrating since there are plot lines that you would like to see

        discovered but are never explored (until later in the game). But most of the anime is dedicated to the struggles of the group as a whole and builds up harmony and relationships. It&#039;s pretty down to earth for an idol anime and although there are cliches, they build off the cliches instead of leaving it unaddressed.<br />

Art: 9/10<br />
What more can I say? They all look SUPER pretty. It&#039;s an idol anime afterall, can&#039;t have idols without prettiness. It&#039;s not perfect since it&#039;s got some spotty CG in there, but most of it&#039;s pretty well done. It was just a bit jarring with the switch between animation and CG. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
Great soundtrack. If you don&#039;t find yourself humming along to the songs, it&#039;ll usually end up stuck in your head later. They originally had some great songs, but then added in more anime original songs to keep even the fans of the game happy. The voice acting is also superb. Each voice actor does an amazing job at making the characters sound natural and like their own selves. They really seem alive rather than a character in a show. <br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
There is no way you will not love every single one of these characters. Sure, you&#039;ll have favorites, but even characters you start off disliking will worm their way into your heart. Each character is surprisingly profound and is developed throughout the show. Heck, even the manager is given character development. Sure, some more then others (there are a lot of characters. They can&#039;t fit it all) but each has their own charms. Each person has their own set of struggles, but watching them influence each other and themselves gives you a strange sense of hope. THEY&#039;RE ALL PURE I TELL YOU. PURE TO THE SOUL.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Each episode seems pretty short even though they&#039;re the same length as usual. They like to end each episode with cliffhangers, which sucks, but it&#039;ll have you on the edge of your seat at all times. Some of the events are predictable, but each reaction from the cast will have you laughing one moment, crying the next, and some moments of outrage because WHY DO THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS? <br />

I&#039;ve loved IDOLiSH7 since the game released two years ago. I&#039;m so happy to see it&#039;s getting so much love and support. Color me biased, but this franchise has a lot going for it. And it&#039;s not just because they&#039;re pretty to look at. The amount of love the creators also put into the series is conveyed easily to the amount of character building and world building that is evident in the series. Not the usual reverse harem, but bros and girls alike should be able to find something they enjoy about this series.

    Well, that was certainly better than expected. While I can&#039;t say that the first impression of many was wrong - another anime for female audience with focus on bishounens, it&#039;s better than most of similar titles. There isn&#039;t too much focus on a fanservice and as a pleasant surprise it does actually have a story. Not a story I would call great, but certainly not a story I would call bad either.<br />
<br />
The characters indeed have personalities beyond just being a pretty face, so right from the start there&#039;s one of the biggest flaws of bishounen-focused anime gone. Considering that even I who&#039;s not even close

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355786">
        to the target audience enjoyed this series to an extent, I&#039;d say it did a pretty good job within its genre. <br />
<br />
The animation isn&#039;t exactly unique and it&#039;s visually the weakest work by TROYCA so far. That said it&#039;s still an okay animation without any jarring defects or mistakes. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say much about the music - if I heard only the sound, I wouldn&#039;t be able to distinguish it from other jpop boy bands. It didn&#039;t make me cringe so that&#039;s good enough for me as it&#039;s not my preferred genre. Fans of boybands will most likely enjoy the songs.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you like male idols, there is a high chance you will like this anime. If you don&#039;t, you might give this a try anyway, keeping at least with the three episodes rule. While you might not love it, it might still turn out to be not so bad.<br />

    IDOLiSH7 on the surface seems like your run of the mill idol anime, and it opens in that way in the first episode for sure. But one of the reasons why I rate this so highly, is due to the fact that this show is actually both unique and enjoyable within it&#039;s genre. <br />
<br />
(Note: At the writing of this review, I have seen 10 episodes - hopefully will get a chance to update this once the series finish airing). <br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Having played the mobile game for over a year and have dabbled into English translations of the game - this story is incredibly faithful to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272882">
        the game. <br />
<br />
One of the things that I especially enjoyed about the story is in it&#039;s realistic plot line - we see a group of guys who are looking to succeed in the idol industry and are failing along the way, but are doing their best to achieve their goals. <br />
<br />
However, I criticise on the pacing - there are some bits that were too slow for my liking, and other bits that were too fast. I feel that the pacing might be a budget issue due to the fact that these parts usually have a narrator voicing what is happening/has happened, the lack of scenes and major use of stills. <br />
<br />
Overall, as an idol series - the story is incredibly unique as rather than just seeing them succeed from the get-go, we are following them throughout their struggles and wins in their journey. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10 <br />
Absolutely love love love the art! Animation is pretty top quality - really impressed with the quality. Some video game to anime adaptions lack the quality transition within the animation, but this show definitely does not. In fact, I would even say that the animation has exceeded my expectations. <br />
<br />
One of the things I really enjoy about this is in it&#039;s use of normal animation style - transitioning to CG (for the dance numbers) and the use of chibi style. At times, this sort of style can be done incredibly poorly. But in the case of IDOLiSH7, I think it&#039;s used to it&#039;s maximum potential as it brings out the quality in storyline and characterisation. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 <br />
Not going to lie, I got into the IDOLiSH7 fandom because of the top tier voice actors. I&#039;m very biased in this sense because these voice actors are veterans, they portray their characters brilliantly in this series and the songs are awesome. <br />
<br />
One of the things that particularly surprised me was the BGM that is not used in the game - there&#039;s one of them that when I heard it was like &quot;no way, this is awesome!&quot; because the new background tracks that they&#039;ve made for the anime separate from the game is heaps cool and really adds to the whole enjoyability of this show. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
Once again, great characterisation that is faithful to the game. As the game lacks the animation, it would have been tricky to portray these complex characters in the animation.<br />
<br />
However, all the characters shine out and are awesome to watch. Loving the way they&#039;re going into everyone&#039;s backgrounds and problems. It&#039;s very true to the game and realistic to the overall plot. <br />
<br />
Another thing I&#039;m loving is the side characters. A lot of mob characters are unmemorable and utterly useless in the development of a show. In this case, they&#039;ve used the same &quot;fan&quot; characters throughout the series in accordance with how the group is performing and changing. This factor really adds to the impact that the show has with us viewers because we can see ourselves as these fans who are portraying our feelings onscreen. <br />
<br />
The only thing that irks me is Tamaki - he is probably a character that has decreased in my ranks going from the game to this anime. I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s a characterisation issue, but I am docking my points based on him and my biased annoyance towards how his portrayal.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
Love it - I don&#039;t count many idol animes that have made me get teary, but this one has. No spoilers but one of the episodes was absolutely heartbreaking and awesome to watch. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re into other idol animes and keen for an easy watch with good songs/dance numbers, please watch this. <br />
<br />

    IDOLiSH7: More than just some pretty faces<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to start off by saying I am absolutely not this show&#039;s intended audience. Not only am I a guy, but I have never watched an idol anime. I do realize the good-looking anime boys are at least the initial draw for a lot of its fans, but I wanted to try to answer the question: is it worth watching even if you have no such interest in the show&#039;s eye candy? The short answer? Yes. The long answer? Well, I&#039;ll get to it.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The premise is relatively straight-forward. You have 7, for the most part, strangers thrown

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294648">
        together to create the next big boy band, IDOLiSH7. If you think that sounds generic, you wouldn&#039;t be totally wrong, but the beauty is in the details. The band&#039;s attempt at glory is not a story of instant-success by any means. At one point they literally perform in front of a crowd of single digits. You can feel their struggle as they reach for their collective goal. And as they do start to gain some bit of traction, you can see their fanbase slowly growing and taking this ride with them. Throughout the show, a young fan is shown watching them on TV every chance she gets. She tries to explain the appeal to her family and is clearly emotionally invested in the success of the group. It&#039;s these little things that make the journey a little more special. It&#039;s not just about them, but their fans as well.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
Now moving on to the art. It&#039;s a very colorful show, that for the most part I found aesthetically pleasing. And I&#039;m not the person to ask, but I think female fans will be satisfied with guys in the show. Obviously being idols, they&#039;re all easy on the eyes. There is a fair amount of CGI scenes, which are rarely great, and while it wasn&#039;t bad by CGI-standards, the character movements never look as natural. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The sound was really outstanding. The voice acting was quite good, both in the comedic and more serious scenes. And obviously, with it being an idol show, the music is very catchy and will probably get stuck in your head at some point.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Not only do all 7 have their own unique personalities, but each has their own specific reason for wanting to become an idol. For the most part, their reasons are fairly compelling, and certainly not as shallow as &quot;I want money and fame&quot;. The show does a good job at setting the stakes for each individual, making it much easier to root for them. <br />
<br />
It also helps they are a likable, and often colorful, bunch. Personally, my favorite was Nagi Rokuya. He was consistently entertaining. (Shocking, I like the giant anime nerd right?) The main female character, their manager Tsumugi Takanashi, I thought was a decent character, even if she rarely stole the scenes she appeared in. She&#039;s clearly a newbie that was still trying to prove herself, but she also provided a positive presence to the show and you really felt like she cared about the band members as people.<br />
<br />
And of course along the way, you have the &quot;rival&quot; band. In this case it is Trigger, the trio that has already made it big so to speak. What strikes me is when they&#039;re first introduced, I was pretty sure I was supposed to dislike them, but as the show progressed, we got to see more of them and realized they weren&#039;t really the villains of the story. They were just human beings that happened to be where IDOLiSH7 wants to be someday.  The head of their talent agency is another story. This show has a lot of likable characters, but he was not one of them. He plays a bigger role in the season&#039;s latter stages. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything, but he was a history with the head of IDOLiSH7&#039;s talent agency.<br />
<br />
My only small complaint might be regarding the characters is there was a little too many for my taste. It&#039;s just a personal preference, really. I&#039;d rather have a smaller cast that I get to know really well over the course of the show. And one minor observation regarding the cast; it was pretty obvious the male characters were made to appeal to female fans, but I don&#039;t think their characters were as one-dimensional as you see when it is reversed, like in a lot of these harem and/or &quot;waifu-bait&quot; shows directed at guys. The IDOLiSH7 boys were treated as actual human beings, not simply eye candy meant to sell merchandise.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I did enjoy the show. Maybe I didn&#039;t get emotionally attached to any one character, but it was a fun bunch. The music was good, and the story was simple but effective. I do think you&#039;ll probably enjoy it more if you&#039;re crushing on the male characters, but it&#039;s certainly a good enough show to enjoy if that&#039;s not the case.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
IDOLish7 was a pleasant surprise. I have very few bad things to say about it. Like I said, I know I&#039;m not the target audience, but I wanted to provide another perspective and share my thoughts and feelings with you guys. Thanks for reading.

    So as a person who has been evading idol related series all her life, I was convinced that I wouldn&#039;t enjoy this one. A friend recommended it to me a while ago, so I told myself why not? At least there are hot guys! But how wrong I was. Idolish7 is a lot more than that.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The story isn&#039;t anything complex. Basically a group of 7 guys reunite to form an idol group from scratch. But don&#039;t think that things will come easy for these guys, actually it&#039;s all the opposite. We get to see a quite realistic story in which fame doesn&#039;t come as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298753">
        easy as you&#039;d like. Our  lovely group must face different situations that will complicate their path to glory.  There&#039;s even  an episode in which they perform  in front of just 9 persons and other in which fake rumors about them are spread once they start getting some fame. However, the dramatic or negative moments help the characters to grow and are well balanced along with comedy and heart warming moments. The only complaint I have is that the last episodes felt a bit rushed, but overall the story is nicely done.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
What can I say about this? The art is simply gorgeous! All the characters look really handsome, and everything&#039;s so colorful and vivid. A real delight for the sight, no doubt. Also, the show constantly makes use of CCG, more specifically during the song performances. I&#039;m not an expert in CCG stuff, but at least I can say that it wasn&#039;t great nor bad. It was ok for its purpose. Finally, there&#039;s also a lot of chibi moments. They are cute as you can expect from chibis, and contribute a lot to the comedic moments. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
Now let&#039;s go with one of my favorite aspects from this show... the sound. The voice actors made an excellent job in this one since each voice fits the character&#039;s personality perfectly. I also liked how each group portrayed their own style in each song. The songs by Idolish7 are more catchy and suitable to dance and have fun, while the songs by Trigger are more elegant and serious, but equally enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
What I like about this anime the most is that despite presenting a huge cast of characters, it gives some development to everyone. We get to see what motivates each guy to become an idol and how each one of them deals with their fame as individuals and as part of a group. There are many character interactions that allow us to appreciate how each member feels  and how they get along with the other members. <br />
<br />
And let&#039;s not forget about the rival group, Trigger. This group is already famous and basically our main characters aspire to reach the level of fame they have. The three members of Trigger are really charismatic. I really enjoyed their performances and their interactions with the main characters. At the end I decided that my favorite character from this series was one of the members of Trigger, so no doubt I enjoyed their existence on here. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Did I enjoy this? Of course I did! I&#039;d rewatch it without hesitation. The characters are interesting, the comedy is good, the music is great...yeah, I did enjoy this more than I expected from an idols show. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
I&#039;d definitely recommend this to anyone, even to guys. There isn&#039;t unnecessary fanservice that&#039;d bother them and the story flows really well. And most important of all, the characters  aren&#039;t unidimensional, they grow and so does your interest in them. So if you&#039;re looking for something simple but well done, don&#039;t look anywhere else!<br />

    I started watching this anime on a tiresome day when I badly needed something to cheer me up. At first I assumed this would be one of those cringy, badly-written idol animes with perfect , bland characters ,created solely for fanservice  and I wanted to watch this for the laughs.<br />
But it ended up being something completely different and by the end.. I was in love.<br />
<br />
Now I shall tell everyone, what did I like about this anime so much that I ended up rewatching it twice?<br />
<br />
*very slight spoilers ahead*<br />
<br />
So first of all , the story. (9/10)<br />
It starts by introducing us to the characters and giving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290165">
        us an idea about their role in the unit , as well as giving a peek about their future struggles (for example Mitsuki and his numerous failures).And keep those struggles in mind because boy, will things be rough.<br />
I think the equilibrum between tragedy and happiness was well done  - enough bad things to keep you on the edge of your seat , but not too much to become too depressing.Also none of the tragedy is there for the sake of tasteless drama , it all leads to character development or moves the plot forward.<br />
<br />
I think the build-up from the beginning to the end was very satisfying , and by this I mean it had me crying. It felt very well-deserved after such a long journey, and it wasn&#039;t necessarily predictable.<br />
<br />
 I also like that it is indeed pretty realistic - not all the boys get along , success doesn&#039;t come easy.<br />
<br />
Art ( 8/10)<br />
The art was pretty good , nothing extraordinary , but i can&#039;t recall a second where it felt off or sloppy. The CG was..alright for CG standards , not too good but not so bad it was distracting either.<br />
I admit sometimes the boys were drawn so pretty it had me fangirling , but maybe that is a bit too subjective.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10)<br />
I love the soundtrack , and the songs are BOMB. Monster Generation was stuck in my mind for WEEKS and I was astonished by how elegant Trigger&#039;s music was.You&#039;ll definitely look up on youtube others songs by them , they are definitely worth listening to even outside the anime.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is outstanding as well, I have no complaints about it.The voices suit the characters perfectly and they deliver the lines flawlessly.<br />
<br />
Character (10/10)<br />
At first there were some boys I disliked , but the anime does such a great job developing all of them (every single characters gets at least a bit of backstory) , I couldn&#039;t help but fall in love with them all. Unlike in other idol anime , where they all start talented and handsome , some of these boys have difficulties either singing or dancing, or have some terrible backstory that gets in the way of them giving their best performances. Everyone is unique and couldn&#039;t be replaced. If you took out a single member from the unit everything would fall apart. For me the characters felt very human and likeable as well as relatable , despite being &quot;idols&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
I come up every so often to rewatch I just love it so much. I want to see the boys again , I want to hear them , I want to be part of their world again and again. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9.5/10<br />
Definitely outstanding for a male idol anime , and arguably the best in its genre as of now.If you are into pretty boys which aren&#039;t just eye-candy but flawed and human , great music and being drowned in feelings , I suggest you give this anime a try.

    I don&#039;t even know why I started watching that anime. I am not into idols, boy-bands at all. I read a few reviews from trusted people and I needed a break from the action-packed stuff I&#039;ve been watching lately. <br />
Idolish7 really surprised me as a good anime, with a solid plot and an overall &quot;feel good&quot; element that I think was very welcome in dark times of quarantine and such. <br />
Idolish7 is good primarily because the depiction of these 7 very different characters is well done and articulated in a way that blends in together as a genuinely good story about a bunch of boys

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342289">
        with secrets and background issues drawn together by their love of music, their sense of camaraderie and their efforts to succeed in a world where basically everyone is out to get you. <br />
I loved the fact that the harem trope was skilfully avoided as it could have been a disaster otherwise and just a bunch of clichés! Instead you get a first season that follows a newbie manager who is feminine yet brave and wants the best for her band. <br />
Yes, it&#039;s not perfect... At times, the pep talks between the boys or others get a bit long and are a little predictable but as I said earlier, they also make you feel warm inside, they did for me at least. <br />
Watching season 2 currently on hiatus at the moment but I will admit that I am looking forward to Idolish7 coming back. <br />
It&#039;s good to sometimes watch stuff you would never watch normally; it worked this time for me.<br />

    I honestly thought that IDOLiSH7 was very good for a idol anime as someone who has watched many of them. Instead of your typical idol anime where the main characters have overwhelming talent right off the bat, IDOLiSH7 tends to focus more on the growth and development on the characters which makes the hard-work of the main characters stand out. Just seeing everyone working so hard makes me want to support them (cheesy I know). Going towards the music aspect of the show, there is a wide variety of different themes such as fun and energetic to cool and sexy which makes the songs appealing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280790">
        to a wider audience. In terms of how good the songs actually are, they are just alright. There are a few songs that I think are really appealing and I would listen to often, but there are also equally as many that I wouldn&#039;t listen to unless they came up on a playlist or something as a recommendation. Overall, I would say that the main highlight of the series is the development of each character rather than just the main ones.<br />

    Went into this anime thinking it would be a harem based anime and oh my was I wrong. This anime has an amazing plot and the character development is extraordinary. I love how well they throw in plot twists. This is truly one of the best animes I have watched!<br />
<br />
Also, the cliffhangers are superb and the art style is magnificent. Every episode is addicting, they truly have no bad episodes in this series. <br />
<br />
Oh and for all of my BL lovers. This anime is not classified as a BL but if you let your imagination run a little wild I&#039;m pretty sure you can have

    &quot;Shaking your heart&quot; (A pharse from their songs) (No spoilers) <br />
Okay so this is my second review and guess what this is one of the most underrated anime which I&#039;ve ever seen <br />
Also there is this thing stuck in people&#039;s minds that idols are for girls...! Nope! <br />
This anime really caught my attention although I am not at all interested in idols and I am dead serious about this<br />
Idolish7 or I7 in short really is much more than your typically reverse harem show......its all about the struggles of a group of idols that wants to reach the skies ! Simple right? <br />
Well it&#039;s simplicity is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397526">
        what makes it great and let&#039;s talk about the music their first song &quot;monster generation&quot; And second song &quot;natsu Shiyoze&quot; Damn these songs are like the more you hear the more addicted you become<br />
I don&#039;t think one should just skip this show just because it&#039;s an idol show.... If you&#039;ve red this far I think you should give it a try<br />
<br />
Thanks~

    This may be the most pleasantly surprising anime I&#039;ve ever seen. I was honestly and thoroughly satisfied while watching this, and I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m going to be able to explain why, but just know that whatever low expectations you have for IDOLiSH7, it&#039;s better than that.<br />
<br />
So the art. Not to brag on this anime and then immediately bring up a complaint, but the backgrounds weren&#039;t the most enticing thing in the world. Most of them, even if they had a lot of color, were a bit bland looking. I say that, though, so I can bring up the fact that I seriously loved

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340275">
        the character designs. They&#039;re in a similar-ish style to UtaPri, but not so heavily saturated in deep color; I ended up adoring the IDOLiSH7 designs by the end of the season. There were a few environmentally based backgrounds that stood out as very beautiful as well. The sound, if we&#039;re talking about BGM, was alright, not the best. I got used to it after a couple of episodes, so now I hear the BGM and find it familiar, but it didn&#039;t wow me. The songs, though, were nicely composed-- both from IDOLiSH and TRIGGER. Actually, I only loved a few of them, but they were all appealing.<br />
<br />
Now that that stuff is out of the way, let&#039;s talk story. I&#039;ll tell you now: it moves fast. I mean, for an anime with a premise as simple and widely used as idols trying to make it in the industry, I didn&#039;t really mind the fast pace because dragging out important moments could&#039;ve felt like too much. That being said, since I&#039;ve finished and thoroughly enjoyed the first season, I was a bit disappointed that certain important moments weren&#039;t dwelled on for longer than an episode; stretching some bits of the plot out would&#039;ve made me love it even more.<br />
<br />
I gotta say, though, I&#039;m most impressed with the characters in this anime. Before I mention why that is, I will say that there were moments it felt like the characters&#039; stories were getting away from logic a little too much, and it took me out of the moment. Thankfully, that didn&#039;t happen enough for it to be a huge issue. I guess the reason I&#039;m impressed with the characters is because they felt like actual characters? They weren&#039;t cringy, they didn&#039;t have nominal issues that were blown out of proportion, their development wasn&#039;t neglected, and their personalities felt (mostly) authentic. Plus, since this isn&#039;t a reverse harem, none of them were unfathomably in love with someone they barely knew. Going back to that development comment, though, that&#039;s what made me love this anime so much. Each of these characters has a past that actually makes sense and has the ability to tug on my heartstrings. I was actually able to connect with these characters in a way that made me love all of them for different reasons.<br />
<br />
I feel like a lot of what I said doesn&#039;t make a whole lot of sense in the grand scheme of anime, but I&#039;m mostly making comments with idol anime in mind (specifically UtaPri). I was resistant to IDOLiSH7 because I assumed it wouldn&#039;t have any substance and would just be something I&#039;ve already seen before. Now I&#039;m sincerely excited to continue along this journey. If you&#039;ve been disappointed by idol anime in the past, I&#039;d highly recommend this because there&#039;s something very warm and inviting about this anime. It honestly does have a remarkable ability to make me happy, so absolutely take the time to see if it&#039;ll make you happy too.

    First off, let me say that this kind of show isn’t really up my alley. I watched this based off of a personal recommendation and was expecting a 17 episode slog, but to my surprise, I actually found myself enjoying it at times (for better or worse).<br />
<br />
It starts off pretty slow, following the standard idol anime beats while introducing a cast of standard shoujo pretty boys as idols. And, oh my god, do they ever put them to use. There is a LOT of shameless yaoi bait throughout this anime. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, yaoi bait (as with any other form of fanservice) is acceptable if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348350">
        it feels organic within the story and not thrown in haphazardly, or worse yet, create plot lines FOR the fan service. At that point it feels like the creators are insulting my intelligence by assuming that I’m just some horn-dog lapping up any image of anime titties or two pretty boys touching each other.<br />
<br />
The anime suffers from this problem, which leads to a whole host of issues:<br />
<br />
1. It would take me out of the show because I don’t believe this behavior to be realistic, especially in a country like Japan.<br />
<br />
2. As a result of this unrealistic behavior, I would view the already trope-esque characters as being even more artificial, causing myself to become uninvested in the emotional parts.<br />
<br />
3. Thus actually became part of my enjoyment with the anime because I couldn’t believe how out-there and desparate it was to get its audience to ship their characters. <br />
<br />
Fan service aside, I also had problems with how the manager character was written. She is supposed to be the audience insert character, but ends up being a much weak cinnamon roll with no definining character traits. She is constantly shown to be inept at actually managing the group by herself and even relies upon a high schooler in the group to make the big decisions surrounding the group. <br />
<br />
In addition to this, the pacing of the anime is all over the place. I legitimately could not tell you how much time has passed between episodes. I assume by the end of the season a year has passed, but if not for the final couple of episodes, it could have been 3 years in the future for all i knew.<br />
<br />
Idolish 7 isn’t all bad though, there are some plot twists that I didn’t think were going to happen and I genuinely enjoyed some of the interactions beteen the idols, especially in the middle of the season. <br />
<br />
Also, the art was pretty solid (except the CGI performances of course) and the first song that the group sings has grown on me by the end of the season. The rest of the songs were either ok or bad and the music not in performances was often overbearing or out-of-place in scenes.<br />
<br />
All in all, while Idolish 7 was still better than I was expecting, it was still plagued by some weak writing, shameless yaoi bait, and poor pacing. But, because it isn’t trying to be a deep drama, I could forgive some of these shortcomings and enjoy it more for what it is trying to be.<br />
<br />
It’s a solid 4.

    when it comes to idol animes, i feel like many people just push them away for the &quot;cliche, harem, corny&quot; vibe that is generally created around idol animes but i will tell you that everyone who i&#039;ve seen get into IDOLiSH7, including me, first started it with hesitance but ended up falling in love.<br />
<br />
of course, the game this show is adapted from is probably a lot better (i can&#039;t tell that myself personally because of the game being fully in japanese and i can&#039;t understand it) but the anime itself is such a masterpiece. <br />
<br />
IDOLiSH7 revolves around tsumugi takanashi, a worker at takanashi productions and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415967">
        the company&#039;s own idol band consisting of 7 male idols which is from where this franchise gets its name. now because we have a female main character and then the main male characters, many would think it&#039;s a reverse harem but i can assure you that it is not.<br />
<br />
tsumugi herself is a very well built character with her own personality and looks and all she wants to do is support these seven boys and make sure they succeed. now, coming to our seven main idols - riku nanase, iori izumi, mitsuki izumi, yamato nikaido, nagi rokuya, sogo osaka and tamaki yotsuba - they are all built in their own ways with their own likes, dislikes, personalities etc. they&#039;re all very lovable and completely different from one another, making them all unique. IDOLiSH7, of course, has other idol units, four in total but with two of them being introduced in later seasons. the other idol band we meet in this season, season 1, is TRIGGER who are IDOLiSH7&#039;s main rivals and just like i7&#039;s members, all of TRIGGER&#039;s members are unique and different from one another. this series&#039;s characters are all very relatable in their own ways and they very well contribute to the iconic saying &quot;no one is perfect&quot;, not even famous idols in this case.<br />
<br />
the art style, i&#039;ll admit, this season is a bit wonky and broken but it is still extremely beautiful in its own ways, the style improving so much more throughout the later seasons and because of it being an idol anime, there has to be a soundtrack, right? well, i will tell you that IDOLiSH7&#039;s soundtrack does not disappoint in any way and suits with the idol unit and the whole story&#039;s vibe perfectly.<br />
<br />
speaking of the story, the plot for this show is extremely well done with complete solid stories, dialogues, conflicts etc. and everyone&#039;s lives and dreams connect to one another in such a  well done and beautiful manner.<br />
<br />
to sum it up, IDOLiSH7 is very worth watching and deserves so much more love and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone.<br />
<br />

    Like many other reviews for IDOLiSH7, they often state that this anime is very different from your regular Idol anime. <br />
I thought I&#039;d check it out myself just to make sure that it really is different from the Idol anime genre we know of.<br />
<br />
All I can say is: Yes, that&#039;s true.<br />
<br />
The anime shows us how difficult it really is, starting out small and trying to overcome the odds. There&#039;s no miracle, you only get through this if you&#039;re tough, and that can be very difficult to handle if you&#039;re a group of seven young and beautiful men.<br />
<br />
These guys all have their own unique personalities and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303122">
        different upbringings, and must learn how to cooperate with each other despite the huge differences. <br />
<br />
IDOLiSH7 had it rough. But their music reached out to the fans they performed in front of. Personally, it reached out to me, too. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s the first Idol anime I&#039;ve watched where I enjoyed the episodes from start to finish and I had to try and save the episodes so that I could enjoy the anime over time but that was very difficult. <br />
<br />
I read that this anime has adapted from a game that has been out a long while by now, which is why the stage animations were made 3D rather than your usual 2D animations. That was probably the only thing I didn&#039;t get used to. <br />
<br />
The music is amazing, some of the best I&#039;ve heard in fact, and each song has so much meaning to it and some of them really got me good on the emotional side.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed IDOLiSH7 from start to finish. In my opinion, it&#039;s far from B-Project and other Idol anime.<br />
<br />
The story once again, leaves me a bunch of questions that I would&#039;ve loved to have answers to, but since IDOLiSH7 is getting a sequel, I hope more secrets and unexpected plots will be taking place.<br />
<br />
Amazing story with beautiful guys.

    I watched a few shows about boy bands and idols like The iDOLM@STER SideM and Big Time Rush a few years, so I did know what to expect from a show like IDOLiSH7. After finding out that this show would have a second season in 2020, I decided now would be as good a time as any to watch it. So, is IDOLiSH7 any good? Well, let&#039;s hop on and find out!<br />
<br />
Warning! Spoiler alert!<br />
<br />
Story<br />
This show features the basic premise of a rookie idol band trying to make a name for itself in the music industry while facing off against more powerful and famous rivals. In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320607">
        this case, the titular band earns a rival in the form of veteran group TRIGGER. In older TV shows and movies about music, the rival group would be made up of villains that only care about fame and glory and have no regard for their fans or even newcomers that are just starting out their careers. Instead, IDOLiSH7 subverts that trend and the TRIGGER boys are actually sympathetic characters that offer the heroes a helping hand whenever they are able. Really, the only evil character in the show is the president of the company TRIGGER works at, and even TRIGGER is sick of his underhanded actions.<br />
<br />
What makes the story of IDOLiSH7 so fascinating is that it unashamedly embraces the fun and lightheartedness of its genre, while giving it some poignant pathos every once in a while. From the beginning, we already know IDOLiSH7 will become famous but the path to stardom isn&#039;t easy and our heroes face constant setbacks, such as empty venues, misinformation, slander, crazy fans and a lack of endorsement from potential sponsors. A message that doesn&#039;t get repeated enough in musical shows, and one that IDOLiSH7 isn&#039;t afraid to remind us, is that for every musician that becomes a star, there are many others that fail and are promptly forgotten. While it might seem sad, that just makes our heroes&#039; struggles are the more meaningful and reminds them and us how lucky they have been.<br />
<br />
IDOLiSH7 features a story that, underneath its silliness, reconstructs everything we love from the musical genre. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
This is what I liked most about IDOLiSH7. This show has some of the best character writing I&#039;ve watched in an anime. The titular group is composed of some very fun and entertaining personalities, like the insecure Riku, methodical Iori, childlike Mitsuki, polite Sogo or funny Nagi. Each of the seven characters has his own character arc and they grow and evolve over the course of the series. Their mutual bonds allows them to overcome their flaws and become better people. The IDOLiSH7 we see at the beginning of the series isn&#039;t the same IDOLiSH7 we see at the end, and that deserves no shortage of praise.<br />
<br />
Managing the titular group is the beautiful and talented Tsumugi. Now, I know that a lot of people will dismiss this show on the grounds of being a reverse harem anime that puts a bland and generic female character with a bunch of physically attractive guys as a form of wish fulfillment for female viewers. Anyone who actually gives IDOLiSH7 a chance rather than automatically dismiss it will find out that isn&#039;t the case. While Tsumugi does get borderline romantic interactions with a few characters, both within and outside the titular group, nothing comes out of it. If anything, Tsumugi acts like a motherly figure to the titular band, and they have nothing but respect for her.<br />
<br />
TRIGGER, the rival group, could have been portrayed as a bunch of arrogant, prideful jerks that don&#039;t care about their fans and do their best to end IDOLiSH7&#039;s career before it even begins, but the show doesn&#039;t do that. Instead, the members of TRIGGER are wise, stoic and willing to advise the titular group on how to become better idols. They&#039;re basically an older, more mature version of IDOLiSH7. True, they have their own antagonists to overcome; the president of their company chiefly among them, but there&#039;s rarely any character drama that adversely affects them, unlike the titular group. You actually begin to care for them as much as you care about the titular group.<br />
<br />
One particular character I became attached to is Megumi, the red-haired girl that becomes enthralled with IDOLiSH7 and becomes one of their biggest fans. I think we can see a little bit of Megumi in all of us, a fan that struggles to have faith in their favorite performer and does their best to support them in their highs and lows. It&#039;s very heartwarming to see Megumi&#039;s faith in the titular group rewarded, which also ties into the theme of &quot;performers only become famous thanks to the support of their fans.&quot; It&#039;s the actions of people like Megumi that have the greatest effect on IDOLiSH7. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The visual quality of this show is nothing short of extraordinary. The character designs are beautiful, the backgrounds are neatly detailed, the lighting effects are incredible, and the show features seamless transition between hand-drawn animation and CGI for the musical videos. This is one of the prettiest anime I&#039;ve ever watched. By its technical merits alone, IDOLiSH7 is already a great show. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
A series about boy bands and idols would be nothing without music to support it and the music in IDOLiSH7 is incredible. The tracks performed by IDOLiSH7 and TRIGGER are amazing and they are supported by excellent vocal performances from talented voice actors like Kensho Ono, Atsushi Abe, Wataru Hatano, and one of my personal favorites, Souma Saitou. Despite the heavy male presence in the show, actresses Satomi Satou and Akari Kageyama manage to stand out as the most important female characters in the show, Tsumugi (the group&#039;s manager) and Megumi (the group&#039;s fan). All in all, IDOLiSH7 deserves no shortage of praise for its impressive cast of actors. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Don&#039;t let the detractors fool you, IDOLiSH7 is a great show. It&#039;s one of the finest anime I&#039;ve ever watched and a serious contender for best anime of 2018. 2018 was a fine year for anime in general, but I don&#039;t think a discussion for best anime of 2018 would be complete without bringing up this particular title. Now that a second season has been confirmed for 2020, it&#039;s safe to say that IDOLiSH7 left an impact in its fans and the anime industry. Let&#039;s hope that its second season can match the greatness of the first. (8/10)

    Idolish7 is definitely a modern take on idol anime and here&#039;s why.<br />
<br />
The members of Idolish7 are seven unique personalities who each possess decent backstories that make sense while not too melodramatic. While the characters seem to follow a certain archetype/trope, they nonetheless add more to the table which makes them three-dimensional. Furthermore, the show isn&#039;t a harem which means that the writers don&#039;t need to add unnecessary shipping scenes. Besides, the show clearly has a specific ship planned. The show&#039;s antagonists are also well rounded and not simply villains out for the destruction of Idolish7. Trigger is a decent rival group with compelling characters. <br />
<br />
Speaking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365878">
        of which, the show&#039;s cast management is well done as everyone has a decent amount of screen time with Idolish7 being the main priority. The show balances out humor and drama, as well as showcase a grounded yet slightly fictional take on surviving the entertainment industry. The show&#039;s lack of insert songs threw me off at first, but it no longer bothered me because I think music wasn&#039;t the show&#039;s main target anyway. The OST that was present is great though, and the voice performances are fun. The art and animation are very nice and expressive. <br />
<br />
My minor nitpick of the show was the way the characters addressed a certain incident that caused one of the main conflicts of the series. I won&#039;t spoil what it is, but let&#039;s just say it&#039;s something that should have been addressed more...thoroughly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, love this show and would totally recommend it!

    If you come into IDOLiSH7 thinking this is going to be a happy, gentle, soft, fluffy anime, you&#039;re in for the ride of your life. Although it does have those aspects... what you&#039;re about to enter is a world full of flaws, imperfection, angst, hurt and inferiority. If that sounds like what you&#039;re into, step right up and enjoy because before you know it, you&#039;ll end up finishing the series and be eagerly awaiting for season 2 in 2020, just like the rest of us. Rest assured, this review is completely spoiler-free!<br />
<br />
Story= 10/10<br />
The story is really good! It starts with seven boys coming together with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319457">
        none of them knowing each other (aside from the Izumi brothers) - the only thing they know about each other is that all of them are here to become idols. Unlike usual idol anime, it doesn&#039;t start off with them being known by everyone. In fact, these boys are nameless - they aren&#039;t popular and no one knows about them. Heck, they haven&#039;t even debuted. They&#039;re invisible. You see them work hard to be successful as they struggle against rival idol groups and internal conflict, while you also watch them screw up big-time and suffer from the consequences.<br />
On another note, this isn&#039;t the type of story where there are episodes of a character being worried over something and then &#039;bam!&#039;, it&#039;s resolved in one episode. Those worries end up spanning across several episodes and it&#039;s going to leave you on the edge of your seat, wondering what the hell is happening and when it&#039;s going to be resolved, only to know that you&#039;re met with cliffhangers on some parts and you&#039;ll have to wait for the next season to get your answers (or you can read story translations).<br />
By the way, it&#039;s not really a shoujo anime, save for Nagi&#039;s flirtatious nature and one person being in love -starts coughing out loud at a certain character- (not going to reveal because spoilers). Romance is not the focal point of this series. This isn&#039;t the type of anime where everyone is trying to get a piece of their cute female manager because love is the least of their concerns right now!<br />
Ergo, what you should be getting from this is that the story is absolutely amazing. Although, I admit... at the same time, perhaps it&#039;s my bias since I&#039;m updated on the latest story on IDOLiSH7 since I&#039;m playing the game.<br />
<br />
Art= 10/10<br />
The art is adorable. The boys are cute, the scenery and backgrounds are nice too. Moreover, IDOLiSH7 is really a series that focuses on the details! After all, there&#039;s an emphasis on the physical appearance of the characters since they&#039;re idols! The angles during monologue and dialogue is good, while their dancing is amazing. You even see them having fun while they&#039;re dancing! Furthermore, it focuses on even the minor details. The colour of the clouds... the dancing man in WiSH VOYAGE&#039;s MV... and the colour schemes of each character! Furthermore, Tanemura Arina... she designed the characters! If you love her works, you&#039;ll be sure to enjoy the characters&#039; appearances!<br />
<br />
Sound= 10/10<br />
The sound is good. There&#039;s an abundance of music and a lot of songs. IDOLiSH7 caters towards a lot of preferences through the peppy music of IDOLiSH7, and the more... sensual music of TRIGGER, while there&#039;s also the music from the rival groups! If you&#039;re anything like the rest of the fandom, you&#039;ll be singing along to some of the songs and be making playlists for all the songs in IDOLiSH7. The background music is also quite nice! The emotional music really gets me in Episode 9 during Tamaki and Sougo&#039;s dialogue. Furthermore, the lyrics of IDOLiSH7 songs are quite inspiring and energetic as well! As for TRIGGER, it&#039;s more, uh, sensual! -sweats nervously- If you somehow don&#039;t like the story, then you&#039;ll definitely enjoy the music!<br />
The voice actors are also doing a wonderful job... you can hear the sorrow, weakness, happiness or anger in a character&#039;s voice! It&#039;s conveyed to you through both their voices and facial expressions, so kudos to the art once again!<br />
<br />
Characters= 10/10<br />
The characters are absolutely amazing. They&#039;re fleshed out, they&#039;re more human and relatable! They have worries outside of being an idol and that can affect their performance. Furthermore, they&#039;re not perfect - they&#039;re flawed, they&#039;re still learning, they&#039;re making mistakes and suffering from the consequences, they&#039;re crying, and they fight with each other too. They&#039;re inexperienced and sometimes, even they don&#039;t know what to do with themselves. Also, they have needs, wishes and things they want to do. Their personalities, hobbies, the things they like/ dislike are even echoed in some of their actions.<br />
Moreover, they&#039;re relatable through various means.  Perfectionism? Izumi Iori. A sense of inferiority? Izumi Mitsuki. Obsessed with anime? Rokuya Nagi. I promise you that you&#039;ll be sure to relate to one of the characters! My personal favourite is Osaka Sougo and he is extremely relatable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment= 10/10<br />
I really enjoyed IDOLiSH7. I&#039;m constantly coming back and rewatching episodes. I&#039;m urging all of my friends and everyone to watch the series because it&#039;s just that good. I had fun watching every episode - they were never boring. <br />
<br />
Overall= 10/10<br />
 I love this series, it&#039;s one of my all-time favourites. I always sing to the songs when they appear if I know the parts because they&#039;re catchy... I remember character details because they&#039;re easy to memorise... the characters are lovable... there are so many aspects that you&#039;ll be able to enjoy in IDOLiSH7.<br />
Thank you for reading! I hope this has convinced you to watch IDOLiSH7.

    My review is from the 3 first episodes until I dropped this show. <br />
<br />
It was a mediocre experience. I admit that the character have potential but what was done in the first 3 episodes? Nothing, I almost know nothing about them, they don&#039;t really interact with each other or if they do it feels like staged. <br />
<br />
I see no training, I see no group dynamics, everyone is nice. And its slow and boring. I know shows they would have fit these 3 episodes in one and would have added even more. Its just boring<br />
Why should I watch this? What is the special thing of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346187">
        show. There are other much better shows (ok I don&#039;t know other male idol shows).<br />
<br />
The animation is almost non existing, except for the CGI shows until ep3 which are really nice.<br />
There is no love in the directing, its always front shoot, side shoot or group shoot. Where is the dynamic? A good example is that this 3 episodes would have been perfectly fine fully CGI. There was nothing creative in animation it was all natural poses (except for some chibi shoots which were also the most fun parts of the show) or still frames of them sitting and standing around.<br />
<br />
Except for the OP! Was this a different director? Suddenly we have nice animation, shoots from different angles, dynamic, fast cuts, facial expression. They should have let him direct the show.<br />

    IDOLiSH7 isn&#039;t one of those boring idol anime everyone avoids. I honestly think that this anime is underrated. Everyone who hears of this anime pass it as they think &quot;Another idol anime? It is the same as the rest.&quot; They assume that this series will be boring as it isn&#039;t &quot;original&quot;. If you are reading this, check it out! But if you aren&#039;t a huge fan of Idols, please no hate! Although, I feel that they left quite a lot of information unanswered, *SPOILER ALERT* such as who Yamato wants revenge on. Also, for those who can&#039;t access the game, it makes it quite confusing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296212">
        <br />
*SPOILER ALERTS*<br />
Story 10/10<br />
Usually, most of the idol anime starts of with scouting a random person who seems to bring energy and life to the darkness. Although in this case, the characters are already really passionate about their dream of being top idols. Also, every character is an important asset in the group. They all show different capabilities. Take Mitsuki for an example, he is not that great at dancing nor singing, but releases passion when on stage or off. Trigger (IDOLiSH7&#039;s main group to surpass) and IDOLiSH7 don&#039;t have this sort of relationship like: &quot;OH WE&#039;RE GOING TO BEAT YOU NEXT TIME&quot; or is not friendly at ll to them, IDOLiSH7 and Trigger are rivals, sure, but also display a massive amount of sportsmanship and loyalty to each other. <br />
<br />
Art- 9/10<br />
I absolutely love the art style! All the characters look so unique and bootiful. Although, there are scenes such as their first concert (Monster Generation) where they use CG and things were a bit all over the place. I get it though, it&#039;s hard to animate characters when they are dancing xD. There are also parts where they use chibi to express the characters feelings and I find that extremely adorable and a different way to do things. Aside from the CG, the art style is one of the best ones i&#039;ve seen! <br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
The soundtrack is the best! There is not one song I don&#039;t listen to as much as the rest! All songs have a certain vibe to it and it either makes me dance or sob. By listening to their music( especially mezzo) you feel a sense of nostalgia or the harmony is just that good you wanna just get up and dance! Even if you don&#039;t understand the lyrics, it still draws you in SOMEHOW. And if you look deeper into the lyrics and find out the true purpose and meaning of the song then that makes it 100x better! For e.g Tamaki&#039;s Solo, Four leaf ring. You may think that it is very suiting for Tamaki as it is very jumpy and that the song is catchy, even how sexy Tamaki&#039;s voice sounds. Although, if you dig deeper into the meaning, he is talking about how he find and be reunited with his sister one day, and that even though we are far away, we&#039;re under the same sky so we are connected.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
Each and every character displays a different personality and backstory, which gives me more information on that one person.  They are all very lovable and even if you don&#039;t like this character at first, they will change your mind.*cough* *cough* Kujo Tenn.  They are all very unique in their own way and display qualities like no other. If I had to take out someone in IDOLiSH7 or Trigger i couldn&#039;t decide. I love them all and you can not pick a favorite! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I really enjoyed the series as there were scenes that made me fall off my chair due to laughter and some that made me dread 1 000 000 tears. Even the most simple things attacked me. A lot of the characters had their ups and downs in episodes and it adds sooooo much more plot and tears. I remember watching the music video for Memories Melodies and reflecting on Monster generation, their first concert. That still makes me cry today.<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
This anime just brought many tears and laughter to me. The art style way beautiful and the soundtrack goes beyond outstanding. It will never occur to me why this is so underrated. Honestly, i&#039;m not sure if i&#039;m giving this anime too much credit or I just have so much respect for it enough to give it this much love.  <br />
<br />
I definitely recommend this if you are into idol anime or just want something to make you cry and laugh at the same time.

    so this anime just popped out out of no where for me tbh...i watched a video about 2018&#039;s anime introduction &amp; stuff like that and i saw gorgeous characters in this one then decided to watch it :D thats it really lol :D<br />
i just wanted to watch gorgeous characters sing and dance which i got what i wanted exactly the way i wanted it so this anime is just a FUN anime to watch....if your looking for some deep dark story or drama which some of the music based anime series do have then you are in the wrong place :)<br />
<br />
story 8/10 :the only thing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295728">
        that bothered me a little was the story...it has a pretty good story..not great but good...they could have used a more interesting story tho..each character has its own potential and can have a interesting story itself...i mean if they could work more on the story part of the anime it could have been epic!!girls lo0o0o0ve gorgeous characters singing and dancing you know(i&#039;m a girl so..)<br />
the story is about 7 different people gathering around for forming an idol group...each of them unique in their own way but have the same goal of becoming a popular idol group in japan :)<br />
<br />
art 10/10 :do i have to explain it really?? they are gorgeous af!!!their studio seems to not have that much anime to offer unfortunately :( i hope they make a lot of anime series with beautiful art like this one and a perfect story alongside it :)<br />
<br />
sound 10/10 :all the songs were amazing in my opinion...i liked them so much :D i even downloaded all of them to listen to them on my playlist :) voice actors do have a pretty amazing voices as it shows :)))<br />
<br />
character 9/10 :so i loved all of the characters here tbh...every one of them had a unique personality and a special story to tell us but the only thing here that bothers me is that they should have opened up more so that they could become closer friends....don&#039;t get me wrong they already are close friends but a strong bond needs more than that :) i hope that s2 would cover this part for us :)<br />
<br />
*some spoilers ahead*<br />
<br />
Nanase Riku: he is mostly the main character here because of some stories that he has with his own twin brother ten which is also a very popular idol in the story :D<br />
he spended most of his life in hospital because of his lungs problems but now he is better and wants to be an idol like his twin brother :D<br />
he is the center and the main vocalist of his group :)<br />
iroi(another member)is his guardian because he finds out about his lungs :) *sweet babies*<br />
<br />
Ousaka Sougo:he is the kindest person in the group...he tries to solve any problems that he can and maintain the peace between others in the dorm...he is an angel kind of a character :D<br />
*spoiler* : not an angel when he gets mad lol..he is a demon when that happens :) and i like his mad face...he becomes like kaneki(tokyo ghoul) when he gets mad :D :D and he is from a very rich family in japan :)))))<br />
<br />
Izumi, Iori: so iori is actually my first favorite character in idolish7...after him the two above i&#039;ve mentioned are my favs :D he is the smart one...the one who always plays by the rules...he cares so much about everyone and wants them to do their best in every moments of their lives :D he scolds his big brother(Izumi Mitsuki another member)not to play around and actually he cares alot about riku :)<br />
<br />
Yotsuba Tamaki:the type who pretends not to care but actually cares a lot...he can be an idiot sometimes but he is actually a kind person and pure like a kid :D<br />
<br />
Rokuya Nagi: the foreign member of  idolish7...he is the most pretty one with the most positive vibes around him...he actually is the reason that the group still can laugh and dance :)) but he can be an idiot too....sometimes :D :D<br />
<br />
Nikaidou Yamato:the leader type..he is the leader also :D he is a good actor and a singer...he actually can do anything if he puts his attention on it,he is a caring leader tbh...he does everything in his power to help everyone in the way he can :)) <br />
P.N:a man with glasses is always the one with a lot of smart thoughts in anime world yes? lol :D<br />
<br />
Izumi Mitsuki:iori&#039;s big brother and a fun character...he is the joker in the group..he lacks some abilities in total and thats why he practices so much harder than the others...he is the joker but he is one of the older ones so he cares about other characters and takes care of them when they are is need :D<br />
<br />
Kujou Ten:his real name is nanase ten..riku&#039;s twin brother who left riku when they were just kids and never came back to him...riku is so desperate to know why he did this to him :|*spoiler*: and we still don&#039;t know lol :D<br />
he is the center of his group called trigger...and the main vocalist of the group like his twin brother :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Gaku Yaotome:another member of trigger who is my fav in total *~* he is the one who acts cool and smart all the time but actually kind and caring in his heart *~~~~~~~~*<br />
<br />
Tsunashi Ryuunosuke:the last member of trigger with a sexy dangerous look but shy and gentle in reality :D :D<br />
<br />
enjoyment 10/10 :as for the enjoyment part..i wanted to see an idol group development in anime ver so i got what i wanted with the most exciting events all around the characters so i enjoyed it..alot :D<br />
<br />
overall 9/10:i loved watching this anime...its on my rewatch list already...if you wanna watch some beautiful characters developing and gathering to become an idol group this anime is for you...the songs are perfect...dancing and everything else is very good too :D so enjoy~~<br />
<br />
