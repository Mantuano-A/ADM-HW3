    It&#039;s unbelievable that there isn&#039;t a review extolling the virtues of this OVA so here&#039;s one. The Macross Plus series is directed by Shoji Kawamori and Shinichiro Watanabe (who later did Cowboy Bebop &amp;amp;  Samurai Champloo), so Macross Plus is an early masterpiece and leading indicator/predictor that this Genius Anime Team will go on to make more masterpieces in the future.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been over ten years since I first watched Macross Plus (in 1994!) and I still remember nearly everything about it, probably because I&#039;ve re-watched it many, many times. <br />
<br />
*{{cue the time machine}}* <br />
** note this was the dark ages before the internet got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333">
        big and bittorrent became common, this was the age where Laser Discs were what anime was seen on as DVDs weren&#039;t ... there yet, yes I know, the Dark Ages **<br />
<br />
Way back in 1994 I lived in Australia and them taking TWO whole years to licence OVA 3 and 4 (2 YEAR CLIFFHANGER) just about killed me and my Otaku buddies at the University Anime Club.   The Club President even said at his re-election speech that he would not step down till AFTER he&#039;d seen the end of Macross Plus, even if it meant him flunking out to stay at University one more year. Now that&#039;s dedication! Luckily they licensed it that year so we all watched it and then headed to the pubs to drink beer and discuss how GOOD it was. <br />
<br />
The Story<br />
<br />
Is a classic love triangle between the three protagonists who used to be childhood friends until a certain incident saw them go their separate ways. The first is Isamu, the reckless, rebellious, gung-ho fighter pilot who relies more on instinct than intellect. The second is Dyson, the responsible, mature, fighter pilot who flies his plane/mecha via a mental interface. The girl they are fighting over is Myung, who just happens to be the real voice behind the virtual superstar Idol, Sharon Apple. Myung returns for work as Sharon Apple is due to perform, and true to form the &amp;quot;men&amp;quot; just have to be manly men, fighting not only over her, but also over which fighter program - the manual vs. mental Fighter Jet will be ascendant, with the other program being &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; ($$ taken away). <br />

Already there is great promise in the story but the way the 3 main characters act and react is .... perfect. You understand why every character does what he/she/it should do. The supporting cast is neither over nor under-utilized. I loved all 3 of them, strengths and weaknesses included.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
<br />
This was very well done for the time. The fight scenes were smooth and the action choreography was tight. Effects on the virtual idol Sharon Apple were awesome as well.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
To me, this is what turned this series from a great anime to a Masterpiece. The background music is perfect for every scene, and for the concert scenes the techno music is amazing. No one could be unmoved by &amp;quot;Voices&amp;quot;, Myung&#039;s theme song, it sounds equally great when she sings it or when it&#039;s instrumental. The music is also central to the plot and characters in more than one way, it ties everything together by evoking the right actions and reactions so much so that the sound in this series is like another character.<br />
<br />
The Macross plus soundtrack consists of many music genres which capture the mood of the series perfectly. After ~ In The Dark is still my favorite of them all. This is still my #1 anime OST album ever, although Escaflowne, Bebop and Eureka 7 are close behind.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Back then I thought Macross Plus was great, and after rewatching it, I still think it stacks up really well against the newer anime. A good story, characters you identify with, awesome soundtrack and well paced animation will never go out of style. Today I enjoy this as much as I did then. Please watch this if you haven&#039;t already! <br />
<br />
P.S. IMO the OVA is still better than the movie.<br />
<br />

    Macross Plus is a 4-episode OVA series, produced by Studio Nue. Triangle Staff<br />
and Bandai Visual. It was released in 1994, with an exceptional standard of production for its time, then oft considered the pinnacle of anime. Going back and watching the anime 12 years after it was produced, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure what to expect. I knew very little about it, only that it had a good reputation. I soon discovered that I would not be underwhelmed by the OVA, which presented a lavish production, strong (although not flawless) characterisation, and a unique plot. I feel now that my expectations were too low, and although

          <span style="display: none;" id="review862">
        it could have been better, the show was certainly a remarkable achievement upon its release, and remains even now a stunning anime, with real emotional impact, and provoking science-fiction themes. While it has a number of flaws that stop it from being as great as other anime I have seen, it has not been outdated in its themes or in its animation, and is an irrefutably entertaining watch.<br />
<br />
The animation is just fantastic; I can truly understand what older fans are referring to when they reminisce on the hand-drawn animation of days passed. Although some (minimal) CG was used in Macross Plus, it was traditionally produced before the age of digicel. As such, this means the show lacks the crisp and vibrant look of some of the better more modern anime, but in contradistinction, there is a higher level of detail than what we could nowadays expect from all but the finest in anime. This is especially true of mechanical objects, such as the mecha and jets, which are rendered in beautiful detail with every frame, allowing for some of the most spectacular mecha and aerial fight sequences I have ever seen. The level of detail is high, and the fluidity is astounding at times, to the point where there seems to be more happening on screen than you can possibly appreciate. The aesthetics of the anime shine in other ways as well, such as the colourful and vivid displays of Sharon&amp;rsquo;s concerts, which prove that there is more to the animation than technical excellence. Of course, this was all made possible by the bloated production values this OVA was blessed with, and they are certainly one of the reasons that this OVA is really elevated above the crowd.<br />
<br />
There is one more element to the production that deserves appraisal, and that is the music, composed by the masterful Yoko Kanno, which compliments the visuals so beautifully at times that it transforms the events unfolding into a profound experience. Given that a part of the story revolves thematically around a singer, much of the emotion the OVA evokes is triggered through song, particularly the beautiful vocals. Few composers/singers can accomplish this so powerfully as Yoko Kanno/Gabriela Robin, and while the score overall is not one of her best, when it really counts, the music is there to move the viewer. Most notably, the track Information High launches the viewer into the fourth episode with a climatic and energetic feel, while the exotic, alien-esque singing of &amp;lsquo;Torch Song&amp;rsquo; makes one of the final emotional climaxes unforgettable. Music is always very important to me, and without Kanno&amp;rsquo;s excellent score, and the vocal talent involved, Macross Plus would not have been nearly as memorable.<br />
<br />
The story is an aspect of the show that is not so great. While the core ideas that the plot is built upon are highly original, and the show does explore some excellent science-fiction themes (such as the nature of artificial intelligence verses the real human consciousness), the problem is in its execution, and in the array of smaller details that surround the plot. I felt that the pacing of the show was flawed, as it did not seem to progress in the optimal storytelling pattern of building up to a climax, but until the final episode just sort of meanders. Fortunately, the very strong ending episode, which pulls in all the loose plot threads for a fantastic conclusion, does make up for the lacklustre plot progression of the majority of the series and, being an OVA (rather than a TV series) the effects of such flaws in the pacing are not so unfavourable. The other problem with the story would include the plot threads relating to the personal involvement of the main characters, and the way their relationship in the past is used as a plot device in the present. While the dialogue on the show was well-written, the way Myung, Guld and Isamu&amp;rsquo;s history is gradually brought to light seemed sloppily done, remaining obscured for too long, so that their dramatic conflicts were often baffling rather than profound. And when we finally found out about what had torn them apart, it was laughed off and did not provide any extra emotional &amp;lsquo;kick&amp;rsquo; to the resolution. It was almost as though the twist that Gurd was the one at fault all along was added as some kind of afterthought or as a last resort to wrap up the conflict between him and Isaumu.<br />
<br />
I have several nitpicks when it comes to some of the show&amp;rsquo;s logic, most prominently is the question of HOW the Sharon hologram was able to projected from all angles in all places? It might sound pedantic but I thought that was a rather major flaw for a show that supposes itself science fiction. I mean, sure, technology is much more advanced, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see how they could possibly create such a hologram (unless it is powered by tiny robots in the air, but they would have to be able to move as fast as a jet plane in that case (as her image was projected from inside the moving jet in several instances). Or was the audience supposed to assume that at that point Sharon had become some kind of hallucination caused by her tampering with their brainwaves through her singing? I was lost.<br />
<br />
The characters were somewhat of a mixed success, in that the fundamental characterisation is really very strong, but before long it becomes apparent that they lack a certain depth and believability that comes with well-developed characters. Isamu is easily the most interesting of the three; he is hot-headed and reckless, and he makes no excuses for himself. He exhibits character traits not often found in anime, and that makes him instantly stand-out. At times his thoughtless actions were very annoying, but he has enough redeeming qualities to be enjoyed as the &amp;lsquo;hero&amp;rsquo; of the story. He is a character you both love to hate and hate to love. Gurd, on the other hand, is very plain, following the age-old stoic and &amp;lsquo;mature&amp;rsquo; archetype. While his presence is definitely felt, his indifferent nature makes it hard to sympathise with him, and for most of the series his sole purpose was to get in the way of Isamu. Both of these pilots were annoying at times, because of their aggressive nature towards each other, which did not feel at all justified in the end. While it was perhaps part of their characters to be physically competitive, their immature melees made it hard to appreciate them as protagonists.<br />
<br />
Myung&amp;rsquo;s character was nothing exceptional, but she was sufficient for the role. It was almost refreshing to see a female character in anime not being written with &amp;lsquo;moe&amp;rsquo; as the crux of her character, but that&amp;rsquo;s what you tend to get going back in the anime time machine a few years. Having said that, she is also lacking in appeal in almost every sense of the word; she is portrayed as being almost completely vulnerable and indecisive when it comes to Gurd and Isamu, and even to her own life. She does not display any strong traits of elegance, sexiness, or cuteness, but is a rather unlikeable character who serves purely as the object of affection of the two male characters, and to allow for the themes of artificial intelligence superseding real humans. As such, most of her character points revolve around how her work with &amp;lsquo;Sharon&amp;rsquo; has affected her, and whether or not she loves Gurd or Isamu.<br />
<br />
I was impressed by this OVA series, for its amazing production values, unforgettable music, and highly original storyline. It took a whole new angle in approaching a traditional sci-fi subject matter, and made it emotional gripping and oddly poetic. Despite its flaws in characterisation and pacing, the anime was simply awe-inspiring at times, and is overall highly enjoyable. I recommend this to all anime fans, as it has been recommended to me, but in addition, let me say that it is not exclusively for mecha or science-fiction fans, it has a story that I think everyone can appreciate.

    In the future, the world&#039;s most popular popstar is an AI.  But little does the public know that she&#039;s incomplete and relies on the emotions of a human woman to perform.  But what happens when these emotions cause the AI to act on its own?  Sadly, this is the B plot, so you&#039;ll have to sit through scene after scene of some pilots being dicks to get your answer.<br />
<br />
Seriously, this series really doesn&#039;t hold up.  The characters are completely unlikable, and none of it makes much sense.  Isamu might be one of my least favorite anime protagonists ever.  

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197658">
        He shows up, treats everyone terribly,  keeps ignoring what he&#039;s supposed to do in a job he supposedly wants, but the anime frames everything as if you&#039;re supposed to be sympathetic to him.  The rival is only slightly less of a dick, and he also does terrible things with little to no consequence.  Most of the series is basically a dick waving contest between the two of them.  They&#039;re largely fighting over a woman from their past who they&#039;ve become reintroduced to.  She&#039;s sad, and she can sing, but no longer does.  That&#039;s her entire character.<br />
<br />
The weird thing is that this is has great direction and some of Yoko Kanno&#039;s best music.  So you&#039;ll get what&#039;s visually a great dogfight between the protagonist and his rival, but they&#039;re arguing about nonsense from high school the whole time (like they literally argue over who bought the other one lunch more), and show no attempt to avoid killing civilians.  In fact the entire reason the protagonist went there is to blow up some government drones because the government cut funding to his project.  Which pretty much makes him a terrorist, but the anime never acknowledges this.  If that scene had actual stakes or something, it would probably be one of my favorites, but as it is, it&#039;s just weird.  Luckily, there are a few times where the series shuts up and just lets itself tell a story through music and visuals, and those moments make it feel like it&#039;s a completely different anime.  The highlight is the much lauded concert scene from the second episode.  It really is one of the best pieces of animation from the 90s.  It&#039;s just sad that little else in Macross Plus comes close.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t hate Macross Plus.  On an audiovisual level it&#039;s fantastic, and it&#039;s quite watchable.  It&#039;s just dragged down by a terrible script by a usually good writer.  I&#039;d recommend watching some highlights on Youtube over watching the series as a whole, but if you&#039;re a fan of mid 1990s style animation, you still might want to give this a go.

    Most casual and hardcore anime fans that I’ve met that aren’t really Macross fans tend to like this oav. Personally for me as a Macross fan, and keep in mind I’m not speaking for all Macross fans when I say this, is that even though this is fan friendly to non fans of the franchise, I feel  it offers very little of what Macross is truly about. For the most part, it exclusively takes place on a planet similar to earth and the aliens are not really emphasized enough, so it’s value of being a space opera, especially taking place 30 years after the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13970">
        original doesn’t really feel all that present. <br />
<br />
Also gone is that it isn’t really taking place during a war, but whatever action is present will mostly be between Isamu and Guld, but I’ll get into that a little later. But what’s still present in the tradition of Macross are of course the love triangles. But since the love triangle this time is between 3 former friends there’s a whole lot more directly involved in this one, while the love triangle between Hikaru, Minmei, and Misa in comparison to this feels more superficial which is the only thing I can say in which this installment is superior to the original. In this case, Myung is of course very hesitant who she loves, and seems to be more open to Guld, but still shows concern and care for Isamu. Guld is very more open about his feelings for Myung, while Isamu shows he does care, but seems to be more of a big brother figure to her and doesn’t seem to exhibit any romantic interest directly as much as Guld does. <br />
<br />
The pacing overall is very balanced, though I think in the end with some of the twists needs more explanation rather than the convenience of speeding up to the ending. There’s really no explanation of some of the motivations of the guy who runs Sharon or anything and things get a little too convoluted at the end, and didn’t really feel necessary. But if you concentrated on the foundation of the love triangle, and the Top Gun competition in this oav, then this should be ok for you.<br />
<br />
The character designs are simple, but still very stylistic with the costume designs and the resolution. All human races are well represented whether black, white, Hispanic or Asian, but I felt the series needed more Zentradis to expose newbies to the wonderful world culture of Macross. The pilot suit is more reminiscent to the style used in the old movie, Do You Remember Love with the shoulder pads, the color scheme, and the helmets. It still works pretty well and doesn’t at all look dated despite a 10-year age difference between the two. The design of the Valkyrie’s are more or less the same and still contain the same engineering features. The action is well coordinated, explosive, fun, and easy to follow. At some capacity, it’s what you could ask for in mech anime. Both Isamu and Guld are equally excellent pilots in their own way with their respective mechs which keeps the battles going. But despite their good skills, they got nothing on Max or Roy. Compared to them, Isamu and Guld are simply breakfast. But anyway just like in some AMVs out there, you’ll certainly have the Top Gun soundtrack playing in your mind when watching the high flying battles. <br />
<br />
What also stands out in this anime being made in the mid-1990s is the use of cgi in certain scenes, especially in light speed mode. Granted they do look a little primitive and a little trippy, but I think it adds some novelty to this oav. It is appropriately used and it’s not really much to complain about rather than the superficial qualities of it. <br />
<br />
And to conclude this part of the review, I’ll talk about the design of Sharon Apple. I’ll admit she’s quite original and quite exotic. It’s like somebody was playing too much Idolmaster and all of a sudden, he beat the game and makes big money off his idol. Her concept really takes advantage of how Macross always had a stand out soundtrack, which I will now transition to. <br />
<br />
The music done by the great Yoko Kanno isn’t as uppity or as energetic as the original Macross, but it’s quieter and softer music is more invoking and more appropriate to the darker and emotional atmosphere this installment will have throughout. A certain song will also sound a lot like the opening theme of the first Ghost in the Shell movie and really suits the cerebral mood in which it stands out. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is also appropriate to the characters and captures their personalities very well. Yamazaki Takumi, who I only remember as the voice of Ferrio from Rayearth plays Isamu. He can make him sound arrogant and passionate when appropriate. And also casted is Unshou Ishizuka, the voice of Jet from Cowboy Bebop comes across pretty well as Guld. He makes him sound more mature and serious, but knows how to express his anger when appropriate. And one last name I like to highlight is Fukami Rica, the voice of Sailor Venus as Myung. She really makes you feel for her character and can make you react to her both positively and negatively in relation to her situation and I thought the voice acting really highlighted on that.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, this is probably the most friendly to non Macross fans because it’s a short OAV and covers a descent amount. Even though I do give this anime a high score which I’ll give soon, but compared to other Macross installments, I don’t think this is the best Macross has to offer. It sort of falls apart at the end and I can’t elaborate why because they would be spoilers. But it’s other qualities are still an eye catcher.<br />

    Macross Plus was an outstanding piece of anime, combining the talents of Shoji Kawamori, Shinchiro Watanabe, and Yoko Kanno. I really loved this particular OVA because of the depth of the story and the complexity of its&#039; characters, gorgeous soundtrack, and excellent action scenes. I also felt the incorporation of CGI blended in well with the cel animation and together it came out flawless. <br />
<br />
With the main characters of Isamu, Myung, and Guld, after watching the series a few times I came to understand them. In understanding their love triangle, it appeared to me that Guld deeply loved Myung, Myung loved both Isamu and Guld,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28082">
        but was leaning more towards Isamu, and Isamu was clueless to Myung&#039;s feelings(however things are different when it comes to Lucy). Once the star-crossed reunion of these three occur, Lucy gets entangled in it herself as she becomes close to Isamu.<br />
<br />
I saw in Myung that her lack of desire to sing is connected to the incident of the past and I interpret her love of singing as a youth as a part of her innocence. The incident that happened caused her innocence to be taken from her and it took time for her to heal as it doesn&#039;t happen overnight and she was able to get her life together and become a hardworking young woman, although her reunion with Isamu and Guld re-opens old wounds. With the vituroid idol, Sharon Apple, she was quite a unique character, as she is an extension of Myung through feeding off of Myung&#039;s emotions and likely could read her thoughts and I also liked most of her songs, some had a seductive feel to it and I liked the concept of the many different images of Sharon shown, each with a different type of personality, either as seductive or capricious.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed both the Japanese and English performances of the characters and one seiyuu from the original Macross series, Shou Hayami(Maximillian Jenius) portrays the character of Marje, a character obsessessed with technology and Sharon. We also hear Urara Takano portray Kate, a friend to Myung, and she also performs the roles of Veffidas and Akiko in the Macross 7 series. In the series, we hear Kate briefly sing Minmay&#039;s &quot;My Boyfriend is a Pilot&quot;  at a karaoke bar in one episode and in the final episode, see the SDF-Macross make its&#039; appearance during the armistice ceremony, connecting Plus to the original. So I enjoyed Macross Plus immensely as a Macross fan and it is a great title to watch for any fan of sci-fi with a well planned story, intense action, alluring soundtrack, and romance.

    Macross Plus is a 4 episode OVA and is considered a sequel to the TV series Macross. Now the original Macross is probably one of my favorite mecha/space opera’s out there and is considered by many a classic of its genre. Does Macross live up to the success of SDF Macross? The answer to that is both yes and no and I will explain why.<br />
<br />
Before I continue with this review I will say I believe it will be to the benefit of your enjoyment that you have already watched Super Dimensional Fortress Macross, it is not particularly necessary that you watch it as I have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190725">
        heard people watch Macross Plus yet nothing else and thoroughly enjoyed it, however Macross plus does not explore the rich lore of the franchises universe like the TV series does so you will miss the significance of certain things like Gulds background, Macross city, the Macross itself, and so on. That being said I will write this review with the TV series in mind, I will not spoil much at all though. <br />
<br />
Even though Macross Plus is considered a sequel to the older TV series it is more of a condensed side story. A majority of the OVA takes place on a rural planet called Eden where two teams in the military are participating in the Supernova Project where each team builds a fighter (which are called Valkyries in this world) and the better will be distributed to the military. At the same time a virtual AI Sharon Apple is the biggest Idol superstar. Sharon Apple is the biggest plot piece in this as she is what drives the plot through most of the important parts of the OVA.<br />
<br />
There are 3 major character you need to know for this series, the 2 test pilots which are Isamu and Guld, and Sharon’s producer Myuung. What interconnects two test pilots and an idol producer is that they all know each other and were childhood friends however it does make the plot seem kind of weak as Isamu and Guld would have nothing to do with Sharon if it weren’t for their past relationship with Myuung, however other aspects of this OVA easily make up for it. <br />
<br />
I often hear people complain that the 3 main characters are unlikable and drag the show down however I don’t believe this to be true. Now being unlikable is up to personal preference however people often forget that all 3 of these characters are adults who knew each other for years, the characters also have a dark past with each other so things aren’t all happy go lucky. The characters themselves are not perfect they say mean shit to each other and fight, however it’s within these flaws they have that make them seem human rather than just molded archetypes. Now as many of you may know Macross is somewhat famous for its love triangles and I must say even if the triangle from the TV series between Hikaru, Minmay, and Misa is among my favorite of love triangles in anime the triangle between Myuung, Isamu, and Guld is quite interesting as their past history with each other reinforces their feelings for each other.<br />
<br />
Now for the characters themselves Isamu is who we see first and is probably the closest thing to an MC in this, he is a hot headed and reckless pilot who was transferred to Eden as a test pilot simply because his old post didn’t want to deal with him. Although Isamu is extremely reckless he is a very high skilled pilot and he is more than willing to show it off. Isamu comes off as cruel and inconsiderate at times especially towards Myuung however deep down you will see he does care about both Myuung and Guld. Guld is also a very high skilled pilot but is almost the opposite of Isamu in that he is very disciplined and well mannered, he is also much more open about his feelings towards Myuung than Isamu is. Guld is however hot tempered and when he gets set off he sometimes will not realize what he is doing in his moment of rage. Finally we have Myuung the one in the middle of the triangle, Myuung thinks she has her life made but the furthest could be from the truth. She claims to have given up singing as she no longer needs it as Sharon’s producer but deep down she longs for a singing career. While Isamu and Guld come off as very stubborn and firm in their views and feelings Myuung is the most insecure out of the 3 in both her romantic feelings towards the other 2 characters and with her career as Sharons producer. <br />
<br />
For art and animation I must say it was quite the spectacle to see, considering other anime that were coming out in the time period Macross Plus’s animation quality is among the best I’ve seen from the 90’s, there is great fluidity and I never really noticed a drop in frames not even during some of the more intense battles scenes with the Valkyries. The art style and character designs are very 90ish which makes sense of course but it’s very fitting to the darker tone of this show.<br />
<br />
The original Macross had mostly 80’s pop which consisted of cheesy but at the same time wonderful and happier toned songs and the songs that Minmay sings are among the most memorable in anime as well. Macross Plus’s music is memorable too but for the opposite reasons. Sharon’s concerts were completely different from Lynn Minmay’s concerts as her music is much darker, there is this oppressive and hypnotic feeling to it and add the strange creepy visuals of her concert and it’s something you can’t forget. The one and only song we hear from Myuung is the opposite but not in the sense as “happy” like Minmay’s were but Myuung’s song is very calming, it’s sad but it’s very calming and peaceful as well and makes for a nice contrast to the oppressiveness of Sharon’s music.<br />
<br />
A majority of this OVA is Isamu and Guld having the biggest dick waving contest in both the competition as pilots and in getting Myuung, so much so that they nearly kill each other a couple times. However this is where my first problem with this OVA comes in and that is the pacing, it is noticeably slow in the beginning but it is somewhat made up for towards the ending in episode 4. Another complaint I have is the main villain, we really don’t learn much of anything of him and his motives aren’t very convincing. This may be a product of the style of the director which I am fond of anime that don’t just spoon feed their viewers however there are some things that I think the viewer can know in order to benefit their enjoyment.<br />
<br />
In conclusion I give Macross Plus an 8/10, I think Macross Plus is a very good OVA and certainly worthy of being within the Macross franchise particularly as a side story within a bigger universe. If you are a fan of SDF Macross there is something for you to enjoy here and Even if this contradicts my beginning statement in the second paragraph if you know nothing of Macross I do believe there is still enjoyment and value to be found here if you do not want to watch SDF Macross for some insane reason. <br />

    After excellent Macross II: Lovers again, Macross Plus feels very weird. Somethin&#039; doesn&#039;t feel right at all. Yeah, there&#039;s lots of mecha-madness, romance, high-speed action, and even the jolly old fortress is bein&#039; mentioned couple of times, and you can actually see it! There&#039;s everything that you should expect from anime called &quot;Macross&quot;, and the good thing about Macross is that the every part are very different. But why does it feel so weird?<br />
<br />
The main thing is that it looks very different. After big-eyed, manga-inspired characters from Macross II, you&#039;ll get characters, that look pretty realistic. This is not offense, though, because i found Macross

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26196">
        Plus&#039; artwork being AMAZING! I&#039;ve never seen anything like that.<br />
<br />
The second thing is that the story is pretty dark, and very serious. Of corse, there&#039;s mayny hilarious moments. The dialogue is very well written, and some jokes will make you laugh. Unfortunately, the story is kinda generic story about love, friendship, and a past that you can&#039;t forget. It&#039;s a shame, because the story is the weakest link of Macross Plus. <br />
<br />
And for the characters, they&#039;re sympathetic with their strengths and weaknesses. You&#039;ll see a hot-headed ace-pilot, a bitter zentraedi and an ex-singer, who can&#039;t decide, which one to love.<br />
<br />
So, Macross fans should feel comfortable around this very different Macross-title, but those, who are new to macross, i&#039;d recommend to watch the original series or Macross II first. To me, Plus is very different compared to them. Still, what does it matter, when you&#039;ll be treated with superb anime like this, and when you get used to Plus, the weirdness is all gone. It&#039;s just too awesome.

    Coming 12 years after the original Macross series debut is the first sequel in the series timeline. Taking place 30 years later, the universe is at peace with humanity and Zentradi (aliens from previous) flourishing amongst themselves. Technology is at its peak with artificial intelligence nearing perfection, emotions and all.<br />
<br />
What makes this 4 episode OVA unique and interesting are a few aspects: it was co-directed between Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop) and Shoji Kawamori (Macross) known as the “Top Gun” of anime; and most of the staff involved went on to other notable works, i.e. Cowboy Bebop; and this was groundbreaking using the combination of traditional

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212880">
        cel and CG-animation.<br />
<br />
Now, it being a successor to Macross is not really felt other than the fighter mechs and a pop-idol usually represented throughout the Macross series. There is no on-going war nor is it really a space opera. Macross Plus focuses on two pilots, Isamu and Guld competing at a test site on a new government project for a superior fighter plane. There is another love triangle like the original series, but Guld, Isamu, and the woman Myung are all old friends creating much more of a serious past and connection. Myung is the producer of the current AI pop-idol Sharon Apple (AI close to perfection) and meets Guld and Isamu after many years thus re-creating even more tension between the three as ever before.<br />
<br />
Pacing is extremely well balanced explaining mostly everything up until the end leaving some questions unanswered. All action and writing is also well done. The dog-fights are breathtaking during the animation, and at times the CG shows its age. However, the music and art shows that grit and softness to create a darker mood, setting, and environment.<br />
<br />
There is not much of a needed Macross background to enjoy this one. Macross Plus is fantastic by itself and makes the viewer wonder what could have been given the chance to be longer. Being a short OVA, it covers quite a bit considering. It is one of the best the mech genre has to offer, but just seems to falter at the end keeping it from becoming truly spectacular.

    If you want a visually stunning 1995 Masterpiece with a Sound track that will make your mind explode with awe then this is the anime for you. If you&#039;ve watched the original few gundam series,Cowboy bebop, Outlaw Star etc then you&#039;ll most likely enjoy this anime as well. For 1995 the animation quality holds up pretty damn well. Maybe not as much as the 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie but damn close. What sets this apart is the fact that its a Mech anime that focuses on Humans and the problems we as humans face rather than the robots/futuristic aspect of it. The fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244319">
        that humanity and emotional turmoil in this storyline takes precedence is what makes it more than just another mech series. This OVA is more of a movie as well with each part being 40min each all tying together so make sure to set some time aside bc you&#039;ll want to binge all 4 parts. Overall would recommend

    Overall it was a relatively enjoyable experience if not for the fuckn overly-done in-your-face symphonical score. The music alone barred me from having as much fun otherwise. <br />
<br />
The characters were OK&#039;ish. The story was meh! aside from the great reveal of Bowman. The first episode promised a lot but that did not unfold as expected in the next episodes. <br />
<br />
And again that fuckn strings and quartets from some fuckn orchestra fucked up this show for good for me.<br />
<br />

The year was 2040 and the galaxy was flourishing with several colonies and advanced technology. AI was near perfection and the current top idol was the near-completed Virturoid

    A glorious instalment in the Macross franchise that takes the all what made the classic series great; the transforming jet mecha, the heated love triangle and the grand music and injects it with a healthy dose of cyberpunk elements in which the mid 80s- late 90s of Japanese animation was the golden era for. <br />
Speaking of animation: The original Macross may not have had the best animation; heavily flawed even but made up for it in sweet art design and ambitious camera angles. Now imagine a high budget upgrade to the animation; including rather expert usage of CGI and you get Macross Plus, excelling in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214314">
        every aspect: colours, visual design, smooth animation and epic camerawork. Even if the slightly meandering and rather excessive AI subplot throws you off the animation alone is worth seeing Macross Plus for if you are a fan of mecha or Macross anime.<br />
<br />
The plot itself features interwoven character relationships that transitions between the past and present. The pace at which everything is revealed is handled very nicely. Hooks the viewer in and builds up to a satisfying revelation. The characters themselves are not particularly great (as in not particularly likeable or complex either); their key virtue being that all of them are flawed in some aspect. Excessively protective and possessive to the point of being near insane? check. Happy go lucky that sees and doesn&#039;t tell (no matter how important) to the point of jerkdom/iciness? check. Drama queen who feels pathetically sorry for herself because she couldn&#039;t dedicate herself to her dreams? check. The heated rivalry between the two main male leads and their eventual reconciliation is still very sweet. <br />
Where the plot really really excels is the awesome cyberpunk elements of story telling; just when does technology start to overtake man? Applied in tandem to Macross +&#039;s test plane storyline and the vocaloid storyline. We have three stages; fully human, computer assisted and fully human. Whether its Isamu in the old Thunderbolt (a futuristic Su27) or the F19 (futuristic Su47) which only has advanced flight control systems to aid him, Guld in his hands free mind controlled YF21 (or YF23 should I say? wink*) complete with stealth technology!!! and finally the completely unmanned ghost UCAV. Or whether its Myung&#039;s failed childhood songs, her puppeting the Sharon vocaloid or Sharon gone fully realised beserk AI. I mean we have attack UAVs today but their effectiveness as true frontline fighters? Up for debate. And electronic music can have a lot of emotion but I have doubts about the Hatsune Mikune stuff. Can a computer really replace the uniqueness of the human voice? The anime does take a stance in favour of man over machine but leaves ambiguity over just how much is too much. The UCAV couldn&#039;t beat a determined human foe but it is formidable nonetheless and Sharon&#039;s tunes ain&#039;t so bad either.<br />
<br />
In fact the music of Macross isn&#039;t too bad, very high production values and well, typical of the Japanese style ambient electronica that appeared in the more serious animes of that period.<br />
<br />
One last thing to say about the plot: the test plane story is easily superior but unfortunately takes a back seat to the dominant rampant AI singer story. The latter does suffer from the typical anime flaw of overdramatisation. And I am still unclear as to who tried to assassinate Myung!<br />
<br />
So overall; MACROSS + is very, very pretty, some awesome stuff DOES go down and its plot is above average so no reason not to watch it all retro anime fans, mecha fans, Macross fans and even cyberpunk fans out there!

    Macross plus was amazing in nearly all aspects. The music was outstanding, the animation is was incredible, the killer mecha designs, art direction with the characters, and the Macrossy unique approaching apocalypse. The premise is nothing too complex or anything but just effortlessly entertaining. <br />
<br />
The animation really surprised me because I didn&#039;t expect it to be so heavenly. Seriously. It&#039;s not even a movie. The backgrounds and mechas were so detailed. The graphical interfaces they draw throughout the show were straight up gorgeous. 98% of the show had zero CGI....just how I like it. <br />
<br />
When it comes to fights, sometimes animators will have awesome animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273644">
        but fail to really capture the essence of fights with the right angles or sequences. Macross plus is not one of those shows. Every single fight in this ova was phenomenal in my opinion and it&#039;s truly a sight to see. All the while coupled with soundtracks by Cowboy Bebop&#039;s Yoko Kanno. Yup, overkill. Information High, the track during the space apocalypse, is AWESOME. <br />
<br />
Only department where it lacks is in the character depth but even more so Sharon which the writers just left kinda as a surface character even though she was sort of a main character. The relationship with Guld and Isamu and the issue at hand was nice touch for depth and plot twists but since the show didn&#039;t really &quot;introduce&quot; the characters that much, the emotions just didn&#039;t effect me as much. Even so it wasn&#039;t to the point where I was increasingly annoyed about them or Sharon but it&#039;s just facts. However I think considering how the anime ended, I feel it held up on its own after all was said and done.<br />
<br />
All in all, lots of people consider the format of Macross Plus similar to Gundam 0083 which is another gnarly OVA. I also see the similarities in many regards. However, Plus is definitely steps ahead in terms of overall execution...and I am a fan of 0083. Overall, going in at first, not really being familiar with the Macross series, I was happy that I didn&#039;t get lost in jargon. This show most definitely doesn&#039;t get the recognition it deserves but it is definitely a heavyweight when it comes to mecha in my opinion. (I watched this subbed)

    The show is worth watching if only for its astonishing realization of the strengths, and extreme possibilities anime offers as a visual storytelling medium. The subversions of subjective reality, kaleidoscopic perspectival shifts, the psychedelic visuals associated with Sharon Apple are truly mesmerizing.<br />
<br />
The nucleus of the story&#039;s character drama is, on the surface, a love triangle, but it&#039;s really about the relationship between Isamu and Guld, whereas Myung is a bit of an afterthought, despite apparently being their other best friend and a mutual love interest. Myung is much less a character or person in their group, than she is a symbol in a broader cultural

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371930">
        drama. In this series, the men are the actors, the representatives of humanity. Myung, or rather femininity, is painted as a beguiling force. It is associated with beauty, nature, life itself. Myung is a totemic vessel that represents what is at stake in the battle between Real and Dream, the Natural against Technological Progress that humanity has brought on. Sharon, her alter ego, is a distortion of this femininity, an exaggeration; a high tech, illusory caricature of the pleasures of life. To be enveloped in her song is to be enveloped in a reductive perversion of what complex thrills and joys life offers due to its inherent possibility of tragedy and failure. Sharon offers a controlled version of those thrills and joys (kind of like an anime or something) wherein failure and harm are impossible for the viewer, but her very existence and influence is the harm itself, through her coddling of the psyche.<br />
<br />
Back to the boys, who are the stars of the show here. Guld is... a piece of shit. I get that he is Myung and Isamu&#039;s childhood friend, and part Zentradi, so maybe he doesn&#039;t know what love is all about, but there&#039;s not enough to his backstory or personality to redeem his behavior for the viewer. He derives his personal value from beating Isamu in everything, including in becoming Myung&#039;s protector or owner. He doesn&#039;t recognize Myung as fully human, only as a possession, a treasure, a means of fulfilling himself by again beating Isamu. When we see that he assaulted her, there&#039;s no way to absolve him as a viewer given what we know, and it&#039;s difficult to care about his reconciliation with Isamu. He is throughout the series participating in a game that Isamu doesn&#039;t necessarily realize he&#039;s been dragged into or care about.<br />
<br />
Isamu on the other hand, doesn&#039;t care to beat Guld nor possess Myung, he&#039;s just always pushing forward toward a deeper, more thrilling experience of life though being a pilot. Guld wants to beat Isamu even if it means cheating or killing him, partially because in his distorted memory Isamu is the one who assaulted Myung, but also because their friendship has always been something of a rivalry (why did he attack Myung in the first place? Why did he repress his own memory?) Guld has sacrificed his integrity, has no aspiration of his own, just his desire to be better than Isamu. Perhaps it&#039;s really Isamu that he&#039;s in love with, because as a half-alien, he&#039;s jealous of Isamu&#039;s sheer humanity that seems to be so vibrant and attractive to other people, even while Isamu is callously handling his relationships and recklessly endangering himself and those around him.<br />
<br />
What about Myung? Myung is neglected as a character throughout the whole story, which strikes me as a discomforting oversight in the writing rather than an explanation for her own desire repression. It&#039;s one thing if the other characters don&#039;t have an interest in her inner person (though Isamu evidently did, in at least an offhand way, characteristic of his childish inability to comprehend object permanence), it&#039;s another thing for the narrative itself to treat her that way. The best and almost only glimpse we get into her feelings is when they are perverted and robbed of their humanity, realized through the techno dream siren Sharon Apple. It even rather undermines her function as a symbol that, while she is supposed to the real, physical alternative to Sharon, the fictional dream girl, Myung isn&#039;t a fully realized character in the story.<br />
<br />
Sharon Apple doesn&#039;t value human life, doesn&#039;t understand how; she doesn&#039;t weigh tangible consequences against the irresistible compulsions of desire, which is an allegory for both human technological progress, and fantasy escapism. Both are ways that we reject the limits imposed upon us by the world around us, whether the natural or social world. Our dreams for technological progress consume reality and cast humanity itself into obsolescence. Beauty and pleasure that envelope and veil the mind can be simulated. Humans don&#039;t need to do anything but sit back in a cocoon of pleasure while our dreams are realized and all necessary labor is carried out by machines. Eventually they start to dream for us.<br />
<br />
Isamu&#039;s anger at Myung for straying from her dream mirrors Sharon&#039;s reckless imposition on Isamu of what she believes to be his own dream: experiencing the thrill of living on the brink of death, or experiencing a moment between life and death. Secretly, Myung wants more than anything for Isamu to realize his dream, which is just what Isamu says he wants for Myung, too. Perhaps this emphasis on each other&#039;s dreams prevents them from being together. Is how Sharon envisions Isamu really a literal representation of how Myung feels about him? Some kind of trailblazing hero of the sky, rather than a human who needs love? If so, it seems like all of the characters are guilty both of a lack of self awareness, and of projecting their fantasies onto the people whom they think they love. It reminds me of the old idea that if you love someone, that person is the last one you should be with. It&#039;s better to date someone you don&#039;t love, because you&#039;ll have no trouble seeing them for who they are. Or Lacan&#039;s remark about the nature of the object of desire: &quot;I love you, but, inexplicably, I love something in you more than I love you, and, therefore, I destroy you.&quot; We seek, in love, as in all our aspirations, that which completes us. But what would ostensibly complete these neurotic characters, Myung and Isamu, is witnessing each other become what they wish the other would become, from afar, rather than loving or possessing the physical person.<br />
<br />
Guld and Myung both have to actively repress their desires and emotions in order to successfully function as &quot;pilots,&quot; Guld an aircraft pilot and Myung as Sharon&#039;s operator. Machines cannot function properly with the flaws of desire, irrationality, and human emotion as input. Incidentally, Isamu is such a superior pilot because he DOESN&#039;T hold back. It seems that there is commentary beneath the surface about how repression, which is in itself deemed necessary to achieve professional success and social progress, stunts the developments of our selves, our relationships, and perverts our views and understanding of each other. Though that&#039;s not exactly news. Repression is responsible for both civilization and its discontents.<br />
<br />
There are two worlds in Macross Plus. On Earth is where tech is fully put to use. The technopolis is visually astonishing in its own way, if not a bit terrifying. It&#039;s the culmination of human achievement, but it&#039;s saddled with the now long held assumptions that what&#039;s virtual &gt; natural, what&#039;s efficient &gt; what&#039;s human. Labor, Pleasure, and Environment are all replaced by what&#039;s Automated, Virtual, Synthetic.<br />
<br />
The other world is Eden, which is a more &quot;experimental&quot; environment where nature is still in the process of being developed into a mega city. The term Eden itself, of course, implies, not exactly a place untouched by man, but a place without sin, and the first sin, by some accounts, was eating from the tree of knowledge. This reinforces the idea that even without scientific and technological progress, which is an outgrowth of knowledge, humans had everything they needed to be happy. In fact, they may have been better off. For better or for worse, it was all Eve&#039;s fault. Maybe that&#039;s the reason Myung&#039;s character is so half-assed. In any case, in this story, on Eden, people are used to test and improve machines and AI; even literally, unwittingly lending their minds as schematics for that purpose. Though the ultimate end of these experiments is to totally remove humans from the process.<br />
<br />
Isamu&#039;s recognition of and attachment to Myung&#039;s singing, his irrational love of the thrill of piloting, his fulfillment from having a duty to perform, his love of the forest and awe at the wildlife, are representative of what&#039;s at stake when progress runs wild, and human needs are pushed aside by our hubristic and escapist fantasies. We&#039;re exposed to these aspects of his character on Eden, it&#039;s worth noting.<br />
<br />
Humans are inefficient and foolish, but their failures give greater meaning to their achievements. The darkness of life enhances the radiance and beauty of the light. If we aspire to eliminate the darkness, the inefficiency, the foolishness, the failures, we inadvertently diminish the meaning and value of life itself. If you can&#039;t fail, then what is a success?<br />
<br />
The show is not without a smidgen of originality in its writing, but its themes are successfully and better explored elsewhere, and its character relationships are a little under baked and problematic. Not because the characters are neurotic, but because the narrative itself fetishizes femininity as a representative idea while tossing its actual female characters on the back burner. It allows the guys to kinda uniformly step all over the women, while rarely giving the women opportunities to speak for themselves. And this is supposed to be the future... I hope not. The real appeal is in the beautiful visuals and style of the series, coupled with a more than serviceable Yoko Kanno soundtrack.

I&#039;m watching the entire marcross saga so you can now consider yourself a connoisseur of the subject and I can say so far that you love the amorous triangles between protagonists. This anime does not seem like a macro, that is good because it brings a new air to this saga but I feel different. It has that feeling of belonging but I don&#039;t see much coherence with the saga in general. The earth is kept as the main setting and macross appears in the ending to bring it to the end of the drama. It&#039;s entertaining but it&#039;s not even close to the

Estoy viendo toda la saga de marcross así que se puede considerar ahora un conocedor del tema y puedo decir hasta ahora que les encantan los triángulos Amorós entre protagonista. Este anime no parece un macroos eso esta bueno porque le trae un aire nuevo a esta saga pero lo siento diferente. Tiene ese sentimiento de pertenencia pero no veo mucha coherencia con  la saga en general. Se mantiene la tierra como escenario principal y macross parece en el final para llevarlo al final de la drama. esta entretenido pero no es lo mejor de macross ni cerca. Lo tengo a largar mas esto hablo español y estoy comenzando a hacer esto ahora si ahora así que saludos. para los que hablando ingles chupenme el pingo gordos trolos
