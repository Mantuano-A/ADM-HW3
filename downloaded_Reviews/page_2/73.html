Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure Super Mario Bros. Edition is the greatest thing that has happened to anime since the 4th part. In this 5th Jojo -- called Vento whatever in Italian or Golden whatever in English -- we see something that is not expected of anime these days: content that doesn&#039;t suck ass.<br />
<br />
Vento Aureo is told to be the most controversial part of the Jojo franchise thus far. One either loves it or hates it. I am in the lover team because the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294589">
        story is so simple, yet masterfully crafted. It only focuses around few things, values small details and shows how it is better to be master of one than master of none. Do much with little is a thing I like to repeat and Jojo 5 is a perfect example of how much can be done with the given little. <br />
<br />
The cast is perhaps the most colorful seen in Jojo so far. I am personally against all sort of moral compasses and obligatory justice for all bs because the only thing those do is limit the story and characterization, and while Jojo introduces some concepts relevant to these such as the Robin Hood ideology, I am not finding these to be any sort of reflections of moral codes like they so often appear in all sorts of narratives, but simply part of characteristics in this case. Jojo&#039;s cast doesn&#039;t simply support &#039;anything&#039; just because &quot;it is the right thing to do&quot;, but because prioritizing loyalto to personal philosophies is put above all else. It&#039;s damn manly thing to do and that&#039;s why I am finding the cast to be so fun to follow. The banter seen in forms of dialog and interactions is also pretty bro, not as bro as in the 3rd part, but it&#039;s still damn brotherly. <br />
<br />
The art has surprised me once again. It&#039;s impressive how different yet familiar David Production manages to make new Jojo series look like. The colors, animation style and unique ideas as well as the character design all are there to make Jojo&#039;s 5th season its very own thing and I am finding it very hard to not praise every part of it in today&#039;s industry. <br />
<br />
The music is outstanding. The opening song is acquired taste, really. At first I was like &quot;it&#039;s not exactly Walk Like an Egyptian, is it&quot; but now I am like FIKHTIN GOLDOOO every time I do anything.<br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment, this is the reason why I still have hope for the animated medium.

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
I am a fan of JOJO, a big one at that, but this part, i.e. part 5 is kind of overrated. Now, before you guys unleash the 7-page Muda on me, let me address this first - overrated does not mean bad, it just means that while the show is good, people put it on a pedestal reserved for the greats. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get started. <br />
<br />
JOJO Part 5 aka “Golden (Experience) Wind” aka “How does King Crimson work?” aka “Araki flexes on you with his awesome taste in music” aka “Girono’s piss drinking adventure” is the fifth instalment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314008">
        in the Jojo franchise. Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is one of the few shounen that does something which most other shounen don’t, that is, it’s actually manages to be interesting. This season we follow Giorno Giovanna as he has a dream in which he pledges to become a gangster and kill the reigning mafia boss. The plot is as simple as it gets but the way it is crafted is what makes Jojo an amazing series. <br />
<br />
The characters are colourful and flamboyant as has been the case with previous instalments of the franchise and each character brings something new to the table. There are many characters that have been introduced thus far in the series and no two characters feel the same. They all have their unique personalities and powers. That being said, many of the characters in this season are quite boring. Comparing the characters in part 5 to those in part 4 or part 2 makes me feel like there’s something missing with the characters in this part. <br />
<br />
The characters in part 4, along with being awfully stylish and making me self-conscious of my own image, had their own distinct personalities and received immense characterisation which helped solidify their place in the overall narrative, but Golden Wind decides to not have as much depth to the characters and instead gives them some kind of unique trait, which, when applied to minor antagonists works to some extent but, when the same strategy is used for main characters, it falls flat. <br />
<br />
There are 6 main characters this time, viz Girono, Buccellati, Mista, Narancia, Abbacchio and Fugo. Girono is a great main character and so is Buccellati. Both are well characterised and I really enjoyed their backstory, I really wish I could say the same for the rest of the characters. Mista is a character who religiously believes that every person in this world has a destiny set out for him and a man cannot deny his destiny no matter how hard he tries. He believes this because he was sent to prison and then got out. That is all it takes for him to follow his religion of fate. <br />
<br />
Abbacchio is a dick to Girono for some reason and only trusts Buccellati because he has “lost faith in humanity” due to him, with his own volition, receiving a bribe from a criminal which ultimately resulted in the death of his partner. Can you find the logic in here, because I surely can’t. <br />
<br />
Fugo and Narancia can be described as 150 IQ and 50 IQ respectively and that basically sums up their character. Any attempt to flesh out their characters via backstories felt cheesy and banal. Instead, I would’ve preferred if they’d developed throughout the show’s run. I am admittedly shitting on the characters but I can’t deny the fact that watching these characters’ dynamics with the plot and each other was a Golden experience (heh, see what I did there?). Anyway, I don’t hate the characters, but I don’t LOVE them either; I just wish more care was put into the characters.<br />
<br />
The main antagonist, Divolo, is great. His end goal is to completely erase his existence so that no one can trace him, but he acts in pretty questionable way in order to achieve his target. Questionable not in the sense, “Oh boy, that was a pretty evil thing to do”, no not that, but questionable in the sense, “wtf is he doing?”. The next few lines have to be spoilers in order for me to explain my statement.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------Spoilers Start-----------------------------------------------<br />
He wants to kill his daughter Trish with his own hands in order to protect his identity as she could be a mean to uncover his past, and thus he cannot entrust this job to anyone. So, Girono and the gang take his daughter to a secluded island and are ordered to take the girl into an abandoned building accompanied by a bodyguard. Why didn’t he call his daughter in by herself? I’m pointing this out because this is the crux of the second half of the show. Had Buccellati not gone with Trish, he never would’ve found out about the true nature of Diavolo and the second half would’ve been about 50 episodes long or maybe would’ve never happened.<br />
--------------------------------------------Spoilers End ------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now, let’s get to the two main appeal of Jojo which is the fights and the stands. Araki really let out his creative genius in this part as almost all the stands are unique and have a very specific set of abilities which give rise to some great fights in the series. The stands in this part are my favourite as even though there are a ton of characters in this part who posses a stand, no two have the same abilities or even remotely feel the same. Girono has a stand that can give anything life, Bucellatti has a stand that can create zippers on any material, Abbacchio’s stand can replay any past scene etc. There are many great stands in this part; I can’t explain them all due to spoilers but trust me when I say that the stands are absolutely majestic and better than they’ve ever been, at least when viewed through a creative perspective.<br />
<br />
 Now, the fights. The thing I like about fights, especially stand battles, in Jojo is that no matter how outlandish or cheesy they get, they are never boring. Battles are won through wit and shrewdness, not with “nakama” power and boy are there some great fights in this part. Since every new minor villain our heroes encounter has a different stand than the last, the Jo-Bros have to come up with new tactics every time in order to ensure their victory. No two villains are defeated in the same way and the stakes are higher than ever. <br />
<br />
All the fights in this part are great…, which is what I would say if they were. The stands themselves are great and utilised to almost their full potential, but the same is not true for the users’ brain. I could feel myself being irritated during some fights especially the one in which Narancia’s tongue was replaced with a stand and he was spewing nonsense. Instead of realising that they’re under an enemy attack, the protagonists start an argument among themselves. This shit goes on for two whole episodes until the enemy is finally defeated. <br />
<br />
I said that the stands in this part are my favourite, but there is a stand, an important one at that, which is just ridiculously overpowered and admittedly was an asspull. Gold Experience Requiem is Girono’s Gold Experience evolved and it comes out of a shell like any other non-mammal baby and that stand’s abilities are more broken than the shell it came out of. Before good old Gold Experience evolves, the protagonists are being overpowered, then literally 2 seconds after the appearance of Gold Experience Requiem they have the upper hand. I might be nitpicking, but it did take away from the overall experience of the boss fight. <br />
<br />
The art and animation are godly. Even though I prefer Diamond is Unbreakable’s art style, the art of this part has gradually grown up on me. The background art is fantastic and the whole show is vivid and vibrant. Every colour palette chosen for a particular scene is probably the best it could’ve gotten. <br />
<br />
The music is amazing as well. The first opening, Fighting Gold, is just pure epicness and the character themes are pure perfection. The sound that the stands make while doing stand stuff is well suited for each stand. The voice acting is great and there isn’t an insipid moment.<br />
<br />
What I like about JOJO is the fact that it does not try to be something that it’s not. The characters adopt the Robin-hood ideology but it’s not forced upon the viewer as is the case with many other anime. The characters simply are the way they are, they follow their own philosophies and are not brought down by or question the ideals or morals of others. Most of the fights are great, the stands are amazing and even though the characters do fall flat at times, it’s still an enjoyable ride and has probably the best villain you’ll see this year. All in all, Golden Wind is another great addition to an already great franchise. <br />
<br />
Tl;dr<br />
Go watch it. <br />

    You know, I will be relentless when writing this review, but I do feel compassion for Araki’s situation when writing this story. Coming out of his enormous success with previous Jojo’s parts, having a huge follow up by fans, and probably being laurelled by praise of his editors, it would be simple for him to accommodate. To stop trying, challenging himself and coming with ways for improvement. This movement is something Araki does not fall into, though to the expense of failing hard the ceiling of his own works above him.<br />
<br />
The general premise of a Jojo part, is no brainers for anyone familiar with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314054">
        series, we have our megalomaniac villain to defeat, a group of idealistic heroes, the clear distinction between good and evil. And, of course the oldest way of resolving conflict, proving your rightness, by simply eliminating the other guy, and his objection. Fighting and beating the crap of bad guys is the main element of Jojo, with its bombastic, masculine fights and weird powers. To an extent I am not much of a fan of mega complex power systems in general, those are simply endless rules, limitations, specific powers, which mean nothing, and just amount for the author playing really complicated logistic chess with himself in every battle (with endless exposition). Nevertheless, I respect the variability, and immense number of circumstance those create.<br />
<br />
Really, there is nothing wrong with this premise; it can amount to some of the more interesting works of fiction. Araki himself, has already proved repeatedly, he can spun this mold, to something at least interesting. Playing such stupidity earnestly, filling simple narratives with energy, a grand scope, and comprehensible dramatic and logistical stakes, can generate great entertainment. <br />
<br />
<br />
This was sadly not the case here. Araki takes out most of his dry stupid humor, the situation awareness, and pleasure in indulging in baffling scenarios.  There was always a tendency at looking at the humorous, seeing conflict, world and the general scenarios as a joke in Jojo’s, the climax of part 2 being exactly about how nothing makes sense, and the protagonist poking fun at the antagonist, and chain of events. There was always an unbelievably childish humor, filled with eschatological occurrences (fezzes everywhere), pointless gore (lots of killed animals), endless sadistic unbelievable murders, waiting at every corner. The characters were smartasses, just throwing one liners, and witty dialogue at one another, overreacting to everything in the most enjoyable way possible.<br />
<br />
Now most of this is gone, or toned down.  The bizarreness remains in name, but is sadly lacking in attitude. Those were replaced with more drama, serious naturalistic reactions, and long moments of people staring at another, rationally thinking the best course of option. Or in the endless joyless fights, that comprised most of any specific episode. Levity is kept to a minimum, self-importance of specific situations and conflicts raises to unbelievable heights. Character interactions, witty dialogues and bouncing personalities, that were mandatory in any episode of parts 3 or 4, are barely here.<br />
<br />
A shame none of this serves to make a more meaningful narrative. Characters are barely anything more than skilled stand users, which fight really well. There is strange case to be made for them, because they seem to make the impossible, start to get less interesting the more the story progress. It is as if you know less about this people at the end of the line, than at the end of first quarter. The flashbacks and introductions are promising, presenting group dynamics, personalities, their wants, needs and troubles in life. When finishing their specific episodes, any main character narrative is over, their motivations go nowhere, development is nonexistent, ideals are barely there, specific quirks and attitudes are so rarely remembered they barely count as there.  There is no one with a comprehensible, well-developed mentality, and specific mindset. The cast mostly consist of the same guy, all mechanically dealing with the next enemy of the week most of the time, with not much else going on.<br />
<br />
However, those pale in comparison, to the disastrous structure. Events and objectives come and go, with seemingly very little progression, or any meaningful change. There is no reason for the climax to not have happened maybe 15, or even more episodes earlier, and nothing occurs of substance in most of the side quests. You have these awful character deaths being sold as grand twists, when they actually mean nothing in the grand scheme, change nothing, and are not even culminating or cathartic for the characters themselves (with one exception). Those amount only to sappy excuses for everybody to get sad for a moment, and then quickly move on as if nothing happened. This ends in a climax, where the main conflict is resolved with no internal change, or the protagonist learning something, but by being granted the ultimate bullshit power up, and everybody stands (including the audience) having no idea what the fuck it does. Of course, there is an even better epilogue, about a minor story before the events of the main series, which helps not to inform or close character or story, but just to give a better sense of the brilliant recurring theme of destiny. Those priorities are just so completely wrong.<br />
<br />
Despite still considering Araki a good writer, there is no other label than disappointment to part 5. Because of overextending a simple story, while removing everything that made it fun. While some individual moments, and battles are actually enjoyable (Araki is a master at twists, constantly changing and messing a fight scene), those are completely eclipsed by a messy whole. Obscuring the weirdness and coolness of narrative, in cloth of self-importance and pretentions is a mistake I did not expect from the man, and found nothing in his vision to compensate.<br />

    Part 5 anime made something impossible. Not only it lived up to the hype, but it came like a rocket and broke a roof called &quot;expectations&quot;. As for now, 7 episodes in, i can most definitely say that this is the best anime adaptation i&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
David Production- they just know what they&#039;re doing. Up until this point all they were lacking was the budget. And with money from monhun and tsubasa, they could finally deliver anime that not only does the honor to the manga, but also brings it to the whole new level. <br />
<br />
Everything in the anime, as for now, is just perfect.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294583">
        Sound design, the art (call if blasphemy, but sometimes it looks even better than Araki&#039;s work), animation, voice acting, even pacing. You can literally feel the heart and passion(e) that David put in this one- there are dozens of scenes that would be either skipped, or ignored by other studios. Just from the seventh- the legendary and mythical, the dance scene. It was what? 6 panels in the manga? One page. They made a music clip out of it! All the colors, the moves. the song in this scene... just wow. And just couple of minutes later- 2 of Six Bullets are high fiving one another, for 10 seconds. Any other studio would just drop it, or make it 5-6 frames. But not david- because they want to deliver the most enterteining and fun experience you can imagine.<br />
<br />
Every now and then David would throw in some &quot;anime original&quot;- extension of the situations we already know from the manga. First 5 minutes of ep1 are the &quot;filler&quot; that introduce you to this world better, show Giorno&#039;s personality etc. Then you have Abbachio meeting Bruno- that didn&#039;t have to be in there, but David wanted to deepen the characters even more.<br />
<br />
Part 5 anime is doing something more than &quot;panel by panel&quot; adaptation. What i love in almost every piece of media- doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a game, film or anime- is the dedication in the production staff. I can only care as much, as they did. <br />
<br />
And David cares. Not only about the money, but also about their fans, and the franchise they are working on. Purely glorious.<br />
<br />
The saddest part of this anime is that after each episode, i have to wait another week. I have never been this excited about JoJo, as am i now. And i didn&#039;t even like part 5 manga this much! 10/10 boyz.

    As I sat and finished watching the 39-episode saga of Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind, I had a small tear in my eye. It’s aftermath result of this extraordinary adventure. Crafted from the mind of Hirohiko Araki, he managed to bring his ideas to life with brilliance, charisma, and beauty. For how this show turned out in the end, I can easily say that the 5th part of the iconic Jojo franchise is one to welcome with open arms.<br />
<br />
A journey into the Jojo franchise may take some time for newer viewers to get used to. Luckily at this point, any fan jumping into Golden Wind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314002">
        should be familiar with the Jojo experience. David Productions managed to bring their A-game into the show with fluid choreography and stylistic action scenes. Almost every fight feels unique with the mind games, Stand abilities, and occasional trash talk. Dialogues added in makes the fight feel engaging because let’s face it, who wants to watch a dragged out battle filled with nonsense? Some shows with similar genres fall for this mistake but Golden Wind makes the best of it. Plus, you can be sure to experience some awesome battle music such as Bruno’s theme song in the anime.<br />
<br />
With another 39 episodes, you may wonder the overall direction of the story. Jojo has been known to be faithful to its fans when it comes to adaptation standards. The previous Jojo anime series followed a formula of adapting each arc at a careful pace. Golden Wind compresses approximately 155 chapters to work with and the roadmap seemed like it would be difficult to fit into 39 episodes. In fact, this show actually inserted some anime original scenes to flesh out the overall tone of the story. Mind you, accomplishing this feat is not easy as it would require omitting some content. Thankfully, the show managed to stay intact. Some of the more prominent battles (such as against King Crimson) makes a huge impact to show how dangerous the antagonists can be while making the protagonists looks strong at the same time. Speaking of which, who are the gang of characters joining this season?<br />
<br />
One of the most prominent characters is none other than the Stand user of Gold Experience, Giorno Givanna. Now I’m not going to lie but compared to other previous Jojo protagonists, he stands out more as a lesser heroic guy. With his tactical mind and colder personality, Giorno can take some time to get used to at first. Comparing to other Jojo characters, he is also much more serious and thus have lesser time to make jokes in the show. Luckily, this season still has a lot of room for entertainment with its balanced cast. The most important one consists of the group led by Bruno Bucciatari. This group consists of mainly outcasts and in general, characters who wants to bring a purpose to their lives. Their main mission is to protect a young woman named Trish Una. The group itself consists of a unique character cast of various personalities. What really sells their characters is how each of them are carefully developed with their background stories. Their presence in the show got me invested into each of them for not only their roles but how they became who they are in the present storyline. This list includes the Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, and even the childish Narancia Ghirga. Even Bruno’s right-hand man, Pannacotta Fugo becomes an important figure despite being a side character. Trish’s character also develops throughout the story that sees her growing up from a spoiled brat to a courageous companion in the group. At the end of the day, it’s easy to pick out at least one or two characters you can relate to or find likable.<br />
<br />
Similar to previous Jojo series, Golden Wind has a diverse range of antagonists and groups. The Italian mafia gang known as “Passione” is easily the most dominate group led by Diavolo. With a large amount of operatives and secrecy, Passione tests the limits of how powerful a group really can be in the Jojo franchise. The boss Diavolo himself is also a mysterious character whose secrecy makes him one of the most intriguing characters in the show. As the owner of one of the most dangerous Stands, he’s no pushover and in fact becomes the biggest threat to the main characters. Other prominent members of Passione such as Polpo, Zucchero, and Luca brings unique problems in each of their arcs. While it may feel redundant at first with the familiar “monster of the week” adventure formula, Golden Wind makes the most of its villains to make them as memorable as possible. This also extends to the assassins from La Squad Esecuzoni as each arc feel like an adventurous thriller with the antagonists trying to kill Trish. However, we shouldn’t also declare the protagonists in the show as caped heroes. Honestly, it’s easy to see the main protagonists as anti-heroes. If we take a look at some of their actions, they include killing if it means getting the job done. This is a take on a darker version of the previous Jojo protagonists but also brings in a refreshing side of the show. Whether you agree with their actions or not, it stands firm that Golden Wind contains some questionable content. I’m just glad the anime adapted the content for what it is and didn’t fall victim to dreaded censorship.<br />
<br />
Golden Wind hits the ball out of the park with its technical elements. The art style looks fantastic with its character details. In particular, the Stands in this show are all decorated with unique characteristics that makes them stand out. The camera angles of the battles scenes also makes every fight feel impactful. Even the close up frames and character expressions are captured with importance. Director Yasuhiro Kimura makes a strong impression with its art direction and deserves praise. Similarly, the music in the show carries a great amount of charisma with its OST. Fighting Gold became one of my favorite OP songs of the year for its fighting lyrics and choreography. Keeping in pace with its other bizarre elements, “Uragirimono no Requiem” also hits the mark with visual dynamics. <br />
<br />
After weeks and weeks of bizarre adventure, we’ve finally arrived at the end and it’s been an unforgettable journey. Following Giorno and his comrades together is more than just a golden experience. Having read the manga, I had high expectations for this adaptation and it left me with no less than being impressed. This show may be over but the Jojo universe is still open for exploration. And when the anime adaptation of Stone Ocean inevitably gets announced someday, we can relive another bizarre adventure again.

    A masterpiece that can not be put into words<br />
 As a long time JJBA fan (read the manga way before season 1 aired), I had my hopes of a faithful adaptation, but I understood it is very hard, considering JJBA is very hard. Nonetheless, DavidPro did an amazing job!<br />
 <br />
Story 10/10<br />
 <br />
Set in Italy in 2001, we meet Giorno. Your average thug at first sight, he does not mind ripping people off. If its money, it is hardly a problem. He does not associate with gangsters tho, because he does not do contract killings and is especially anti drugs, seeing that Italy and its kids

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294588">
        are ravaged by addiction. So this young man, who just happens to be son of Dio Brando himself, goes on a path leading to the death of the most prolific gang in Italy and its boss. He joins the gang itself in an attempt to overthrow the boss and clear the streets of Italy, with the help of Bruno, Narancia, Mista, Trish, Abbachio and Fugo, his own team, led by Bruno himself. His travels take him all over Italy, showing beautiful scenery, having amazing Stand fights, objectively, the best Stand fights in the entire JJBA franchise. DP added its own touch to the story which makes this a 10/10. <br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
<br />
 I would say DP doesn&#039;t disappoint, but that&#039;s taking it easy. The art is absolutely AMAZING! 1:1 adaptation to manga, this is the truest we&#039;ve ever seen to Araki&#039;s art. The animation is fluid and has weight to it. YOU FEEL THOSE PUNCHES. Color changes mid scene, flashes, special effects, it is ART. <br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
<br />
 DP back at it again with its sound effects, amazing opening sang by Coda (Bloody Storm, JJBA Battle Tendency) and an ending by Jodeci (Freekn&#039; you). The sound effects make Stands stand out more than ever before in the series, I myself was caught off guard by sheer perfection of sound effects they used compared to other parts which were good on their own. <br />
Character 10/10 If DP didn&#039;t add subtle touches, I would put it a 9/10, but they made Giorno into an actual character (in the manga he was lacking expression most of the time, being too stoic). Giorno feels very much real and I have no doubt that the rest of the crew is going to shine. This is the only time I can say that anime studio did not make a mistake by changing some things from the manga. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10 <br />
<br />
This is JoJo. The title alone says it all. Over the top fights, amazing music, cool characters and designs, it has it all. It is absolutely amazing and eye catching, every frame along the way. I enjoy this part way more than the others, and the others were nothing short of a perfect score. <br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
<br />
 This is a passion work of DavidPro. Other parts were an adaptation, this is a passion work. Vento Aureo is what happens when perfect music, meets perfect setting, meets perfect characters, meets perfect studio. <br />

    This fifth instalment of JoJo tells, of a group of boys in search of justice and a world that, thanks to them and their heroism, will begin to change for the better. Boys who live, sacrifice themselves, fight against an apparently incontrovertible destiny, bringing with them an resolute spirit, a golden wind that blows away the injustices from the world.<br />
<br />
The review may contain spoilers.<br />
<br />
The story is set in Italy, precisely in Naples, a city where crime unleashed and the state is absent most of the time. Giovanna Giorno, raised by a childless mother and a violent father, suffers all kinds of bullying. Everything changes when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314005">
        the boy one day saves the life of a &quot;mafioso&quot; and the latter, to thank the young man, solves all the problems giorno has found in his life. His personal dream is to become the head of a criminal organization called &quot;Passione&quot;. The Golden Wind story is more intense than that of Diamond is unbreakable, which had generally more relaxed atmospheres due to the fact that it showed a lot of the daily life of the characters in their city and developed the plot in a very slow way.<br />
<br />
Giorno, thanks to his stand, &quot;Gold Experience&quot; (which transforms inanimate objects, into animates) and the usual group that is created, he has to face so many adventures, fights, travels. Compared to the third and fourth series, in &quot;Vento Aureo&quot;, Araki finally inserts a supporting storyline and the characters are all characterized. These characters, designed in a weird way, with these ambiguous poses, with a strange look, with flashy clothes, made-up and dressed up in an almost feminine way. The bizarre atmosphere, typical of the entire franchise, here is amplified even more.<br />
<br />
In addition to Giorno, the group of supporting characters composed of social outcasts, who like the protagonist in the mafia have found a secure foothold. We have Bruno Bucciarati, leader of this group, who despite not having a powerful Stand, with Stincky Finger manages to invent versatile strategies, so much so that many times with his charisma, he even obscures the protagonist.  I think it&#039;s worth pointing out the obvious, that, Abbacchio&#039;s death was legitimately the saddest, in all of JoJo. I cried! I legitimately cried! <br />
<br />
The fights between stands is always more ingenious and their duration grows more and more, so much so that we will have to see more than one episode for a single opponent. Unfortunately, not all the fights are clear in their performance and also some stands such as &quot;Gold Experience&quot;, at a certain point it is no longer clear what powers that stand have. The final clash with the boss suffers a lot from this flaw, so much so as to be indecipherable and left mostly to the intuition of the viewer given the lack of explanations.<br />
<br />
JoJo&#039;s fifth instalment does not disappoint, proving to be the best of the three series with stand powers. The protagonist is one of the best Jojo, who unfortunately was not understood and for this reason, he is very ill-treated by fans, but his character is consistent, with the experiences of life lived. If you liked the previous instalments, then &quot;Vento Aureo&quot; is a must.

    17th century fop’s could only dream of achieving the flamboyance of the modern day Jojo character.  The ostentatious wardrobes, combined with the innovative powers of the various characters, unequivocally demonstrates that the show is quite bizarre.  Ubiquitous action sequences is the name of the game, and to hell with the detractors affirming the plot is razor thin.  In fact, Jojo runs the gamut of neglecting pivotal facets of storytelling (i.e. a well-developed plot, meaningful character growth and an overarching message) to present testosterone-filled mayhem and comically inane dialogue.  Certainly, if Jojo were compared to say your typical Shonen anime (Dragon ball,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294573">
        Naruto, or Bleach), then the superiority in quality and amusement would certainly reside in the Jojo camp.  Yet, this achievement represents very little, as the bar was never set high by its contemporaries in the first place.<br />
<br />
That all being said, this will not be your typical review, as it will only pertain to the two aspects the show focused on to provide an engaging experience.<br />
<br />
1) Testosterone-Filled Mayhem<br />
<br />
The action sequences feel devoid of necessary tension, that is to say, the tension never feels life-threatening, even though the show pretends otherwise.  Literally an entire episode was spent attempting to keep a flame lit to pass a loyalty test.  Sure.  A Stand maintained a watchful eye to derail any possible deception, which served as the central conflict, but it felt tame, to say the least.  The yacht hijacking to gain Intel on the Polpo fortune was much anticipated, as was the downfall of the perpetrators involved.  New abilities are being introduced at a break-neck pace, but the mayhem has felt rather mundane, generating a paucity in excitement.<br />
<br />
2) Comically Inane Dialogue<br />
<br />
Nothing thus far has resonated or produced genuine laughter.  The comedic gags feel half-baked, and none of the characters exhibit a personality that would invoke hilarity.  While the other seasons had their list of drawbacks, there was always a comedic undertone that shined through, yielding reasonable amounts of joviality.  Golden Wind has yet to find its stride, as the jokes thus far (like the bullet Stands eating salami) have felt exceptionally child-like in nature.  For a show that exudes manliness, this is a tremendous failing.<br />
<br />
Jojo’s 5th iteration fails to meet its own “bizarre” expectations.  This, of course, says nothing about the tedious, formulaic plot with recycled themes from other works of the same ilk.  The present goal of Giorno to assume the role of the mafia boss is uninspired, with little-to-no novelty.  And while the list of Stands continues to grow, their implementation leaves much to be desired.  It feels as though the writers are more concerned with character quantity, rather than the quality.  It’s excess at its worst, reminding the viewer that too much of a good thing, is a bad thing.  The title of show may suggest a “bizarre” adventure, but it feels more humdrum to this point.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
JoJo has got to be the most overrated anime that people continue to take in like the world&#039;s greatest achievement. What started and continues to get touted as just an over the top yet cliched messy fun quickly turns into neverending gruel of meaningless repetitive filler as if it&#039;s written by a drooling old man with alzheimer&#039;s. This wouldn&#039;t be nearly as bad if it didn&#039;t get thrown around as one of the best shonens or just anime in general on the same level as its contemporaries such as HxH or FMA. If you want a story-driven anime with solid characters and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314035">
        thrilling fights using a well-made or at least interesting power system, none of that is here. Instead the only thing to fool you into thinking you&#039;re having a good time is Araki&#039;s blatant homosexuality and the annoying rehashed memes of the community.<br />
<br />
Part 5 is a continuance of this seemingly endless drivel, though where Part 4 was an improvement in some departments over it&#039;s previous entry, this part decides to trample over and spit on what it accomplished. What starts out as a purportedly simple story about a man wanting to take over the Italian mafia for noble reasons soon turns into yet another &quot;save the world&quot; scenario. Jam-packed with an uninteresting evil villain that commands his horde of uninteresting evil villains and an added race to see who gets the ex machina first to win (hint: it is not the villain, it will never be the villain, this series is as black and white as Iceland and Ethiopia).<br />
<br />
Overall the main affliction of the Jojo series is that breaks the greatest sin of all: show, don&#039;t tell. Actually that’s an understatement, it goes beyond just breaking it and more so puts it across a board and body slams it into a ground pulp where it becomes a near-parody of itself. Even as a parody this would be too prosaic. You consistenly get a cycle of &quot;Character talks about performing an action and why or why not they should do this action&quot; -&gt; &quot;they do the action, usually monologuing or yelling about the fact that they are performing said action&quot; -&gt; &quot;they continue to talk about the fact that they did said action and why they did that action&quot; -&gt; &quot;Then usually, a character yells about how they performed such an action, usually going &#039;D-Don&#039;t tell me&#039; or &#039;Impossible!&#039; about how they did such an action.&quot; Repeat ad nauseam with different variations sometimes. This becomes the main contributor to the endless echo in Jojo I have felt across the series, and it never seeks to end it but bolster it entirely. You should get used to my constant mention of the monotony of this series and it’s format just as watchers should get used to it themselves.<br />
<br />
Despite JoJo getting touted around as a return to the &quot;Badass Manly Man&quot; anime that flies in the face of your usual teenager self-insert anime romp, the comedy and plenty of the dialogue continue to be so absurdly low-brow and childish it feels like it insults my intelligence every episode. Whereas Part 3 had it&#039;s obnoxious running joke of a dog farting in Polnareff&#039;s face, part 5 offers Narancia yelling, a villain not being able to think of the word &quot;clever,&quot; and Mista&#039;s completely dreadful stand bullets eating salami or bullying each other with ear-grating voice actors that make sure they are heard. The former situation becoming especially apparent in the Chocolate fight where one of them takes the place as &quot;character that yells out exactly what is happening in the fight as its happening along with vain advice to the hero&quot; ala Speedwagon and others.<br />
<br />
For a show where the main attraction is it&#039;s ADHD over the top action, it seriously has a lack of any fun. Instead, it seeks to repeat and repeat until it can move on to the next series that features a different premise so it can repeat again, and that&#039;s what is seen in Part 5. You could jangle keys in front of your face for 24 minutes and you’d get the same level of entertainment quality as this show. Where I saw Part 4 as an improvement over Part 3 because it finally decided to make at least some of the Stand of the Week episodes matter by having the characters stick around (albeit being off and on of being forgotten about until Araki decided that they should get screen time then they stop existing afterwards), Part 5 takes a major step back in that area.<br />
<br />
Much like most of the enemies in Part 3 where they come in endless hordes of one to two people at a time, the same is reciprocated here in Part 5, but without the Hol Horses and Yukakos that made things (briefly) more interesting than your usual JoJo episodic romp. Instead, enemies simply die and are done with, being forgotten right after and the main characters unaffected and back to full health right after the episode ends. Though, this time, it may sometimes tell you an entire stand user&#039;s life story at random which usually has absolutely no consequence to the situation or really just wasn&#039;t necessary. Repeat until the &quot;Big Boss&quot; (your Dio, Kira, King Crimson) appears and kills/permanently injures someone so that you know they&#039;re serious at the end of the series despite having over 30 episodes of build-up (actually just 30-40+ episodes of the Big Boss sitting on their ass doing nothing while the main characters fight endless faceless bad guys until they get to him) to make us believe they&#039;re seriously powerful.<br />
<br />
But oh, does it try to make you believe that your precious cardboard cutouts are in danger. Part 5 ramps that aspect up in an attempt to convince you further that could die but it only ends up being extremely annoying and above all, “asspully” by the end. There are 4 instances in Part 5 where Mista is shot or injured to the point of near-death in battle and it attempts to convince you that he has been killed or will be killed. Yet it is simply never believable and entrances me to yell at the screen in anger of the predictability of the writing. Each time, his stand saves him, or he just walks it off, reminiscent of the first incarnation of this in Part 3 where Avdol is shot in the head and they simply go &quot;my stand saved me by bouncing the bullet off my head,&quot; but done multiple times, and with even more bullets. Then by the next episode after the faceless bad guy is dealt with, we always have very convenient stand ability of Giorno’s that is able to heal their wounds to provide an excuse for why we&#039;ve already forgotten about that bad guy and the quartet’s wounds by the next episode. There&#039;s even a part where Giorno says he has a hole in his lung, multiple broken limbs and severed veins yet he walks around like it&#039;s nothing and this is never mentioned again.<br />
<br />
An enemy stand user appears, things happen, not everyone believes they&#039;re there, they appear and hurt/appear to kill someone, Narancia yells, they go through the cycle of getting their ass beat and being unable to stop it, the enemy stand user appears to win at a crucial moment, then a main character reveals that some action they did that made the enemy appear to win was actually part of their plan all along and appears to win, then they realize there still has to be more time across the two episodes so then the enemy stand user reveals that something else was part of their plan all along to fool the main character to take said action and kill them, then the main character reveals that it was all according to plan and they were winning from the start, episode ends and we move on. There is no tension because we already know our characters won&#039;t die (until the big boss appears and kills some of them so you know that they are the big boss).<br />
<br />
The stand system continues to show how extremely shallow and arbitrarily written it is, with a backstory as to its origins pulled straight out of John Carpenter&#039;s &quot;The Thing&quot; to randomly bringing up how Stands &quot;limit themselves based on guilt&quot; (also never mentioned again) when faced against the evil Chocolate man. It additionally speeds ahead with full intent on continuing the stand arrow arc that has never actually been interesting since it&#039;s been introduced as it only served as a macguffin for more stand of the week episodes in the past, and it makes its reprisal as nothing but a deus ex machina here. Moreover, the &quot;stand users are attracted to each other like magnets&quot; stance is reiterated within this installment, which at no point feels like a genuine writing point and just another device for every poorly written occurence to be happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seriously no idea why Araki continues to try and make time abilities the abilities of big bosses. As awful of a villain Dio was, at least his time ability was a simple time stop. Here, King Crimson is a meme with how overly complicated and stupid it is. It&#039;s actually rather easy to understand, however it along with the &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; ability shows Araki&#039;s tendency to overwrite the &quot;big&quot; abilities so much that it drives himself into a corner and he has to write some unbelievably stupid pull out of it, usually multiple if he has to. Even with Dio&#039;s rudimentary time stop ability it felt like Araki had forgotten how to actually write a victory for the main characters so he just made Jotaro a flying man that can acquire the same abilities as Dio does because of a mechanic to the power system that was never mentioned before in the past and is never mentioned again. Despite these obvious faults that should not be there to begin with, he is completely intent on ramping up the abilities to a laughable extent. The stand arrow and the requiem ability function as nothing more than a coveted “special item” that lets the villain rule the world and everyone must run to stop him from getting it. Complete deus ex machina, down to it’s sudden appearance in the final episodes. The Stand and whole requiem arc in this is flawed from its concept before Araki even has to ruin it himself. Quite genius, really.<br />
<br />
Not to mention how many of the things it does with this final boss is virtually a repeat of what we saw in Part 3. Same use of sound, the same structure of a big boss controlling minions through evil, evil means, same recruiting of a team from the people the boss controls, same secrecy surrounding the final boss and his ability (though done to an exaggerated extent in this one), same machiavellian villain, same Monster of the Week structure as they go location to location through a hundred different means, and so on.<br />
<br />
As for the villain himself, Diavolo is a hodgepodge of a failed attempt at recreating DIO (who was already generic) and the “mysterious” man in the shadows type of villain. This is an incredible failure, as I explained before in how this part blows it’s load at the end, this goes for Diavolo too. <br />
<br />
The directing is within expectations. By this, I mean it’s really bad and amateur. Constant cuts, jump zooms and other juvenile techniques are employed to a nauseating degree. The art style and character design both being similarly trashy with chiseled faces like they’re carved out of stone and obnoxious outfits that are equivalent to putting a sign over every character that says “I am a stand user. I am relevant to the plot,” yet it for some reason plays it up like this isn’t clear to see.<br />
<br />
Episodic series can work, but it doesn&#039;t here because of Araki&#039;s lack of writing ability. With Part 3 you could watch the first few episodes then skip about 40 of the episodes to the Dio fight and you miss nothing. With Part 5 there is nothing but artificial development that makes it all feel like a chore to get through. Like Part 3, they cannot go three seconds without getting attacked by a faceless bad guy, then once they&#039;re done they have to fight another, and another, and another, and another, and another. Small developments you could point to that are &quot;important&quot; are almost always forgotten about. In the last Babyface episode it shows a strong implication on Trish&#039;s stand ability that serves as build up towards what it might be. Then it&#039;s forgotten about after the episode ends, and no one makes any mention of it not even Trish herself. We don’t see it until her stand ability fully manifests later at a &quot;crucial moment&quot; fighting another nameless stand enemy in a tensionless fight because Trish&#039;s stand ability just tells her what to do the entire time, never convincing us there&#039;s any danger. It feels like nothing but a lame excuse for an asspull and despite having that miniscule build up it doesn&#039;t ever feel like something that was build up to, it just happens. <br />
<br />
The one single thing I did like in Part 3 were the Polnareff episodes, where it felt like there was a combination of a main character&#039;s own motivations and the motivations of the plot to continue fighting faceless bad guys were in tune and we had a reason to care about which faceless bad guy&#039;s face was getting punched in while the main character yelled. That is not present here, and it displays that in the previously alluded habit shown throughout multiple episodes where they randomly decide to focus on a certain person and give you their backstory at a random time to make you care about them despite the backstory not having any bearing on the fight or the episodes. Yet when this backstory is revealed, only then after it is revealed is it ever made any mention and ultimately doesn&#039;t even feel like it had any bearing on the story. An example is Formaggio. This character (that I had to search for on the wikia to find out his name) seems to be on the brink of defeat, when he is at this stage, he has his backstory and motivation revealed as part of a long flashback depicting a larger group seeking to kill for their own reasons rather than being just a group of faceless minions. Then he dies, and it doesn&#039;t matter anymore besides to show you who the next bad guys that will die independently of each other without consequence are.<br />
<br />
There is no excuse for the asinine writing. This is a much worse version of Part 3, and completely reverses the improvements made upon the formula in Part 4.<br />
<br />
If your aesthetic is ripped men in Britney Spears clothes punching each other with no compelling narrative and if you&#039;re a fan of plot devices, ex machinas, and macguffins, or if you’re just one of the people that may drool over seeing the big funny and hilarious meme like the Torture Dance translated into animated form, then JoJo is right up your alley. I really can&#039;t find any reason to find enjoyment out of this show other than in those cases. At least Part 2 felt fluid and not overlong.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, remember Fugo? Not even Araki remembered him, apparently. I recall reading about the whole story on the removed subplot for Fugo after his sudden leave in the story and surmised it was complete bullshit. I see no reason as to why “depression” would hold one back from going through with this part of the story, especially when Fugo was already so barebones as a character and his connection with the rest is rarely emphasized. In the case it isn’t just an excuse, it would have been much more interesting if the subplot was followed through, even if Araki would’ve inevitably written it to be garbage regardless. To forego an interesting arc and leave a hanging thread just because the reader might be “disappointed” (don’t ask me to explain why the reader would be disappointed by a resolved part of the story) is just stupid.<br />

The Animation is 10/10<br />
The Story is 10/10<br />
The OSTs are godlevel and 11/10.<br />
<br />
By far one of the best parts of JoJo. The whole capo/italian mafia setting is so interesting and cool to watch. Even MORE Bizarre Stands, especially King Crimson.<br />

EXTREMELY interesting characters, Youtube has literally tons of videos explaining doppios shizophrenia in-depth, or Risottos tragic story in the show.<br />
<br />
Godlike Animation, headfuckery with Time Skips and King Crimson, its been a long time i had such amazing goosebumps such as in the Bruno VS King Crimson Fight.<br />
<br />
This review is combining all JoJo Parts, because every part is equally as amazing, trust

    I&#039;m finally hopping off this JoJo train.  Just can&#039;t keep going.  After 12 episodes of Golden Wind, I&#039;m convinced that I&#039;m just never going to get back the feel I had with the original series.  It really feels like everything that was joked about and satirized with the original series is being taken way too seriously in these last two series.  They&#039;re really long and heavily episodic, with a good half of each episode being dedicated to a narrator explaining the characters&#039; backstories.  The Stands were old by the end of Stardust Crusaders, the fact that they&#039;re still trying to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298909">
        ride them is just depressing.  I really want to like this because it&#039;s JoJo and the art is really well done in this series, but the characters are annoying and lackluster.  They pretty much exist as vehicles for their Stands now.<br />
<br />
So yeah, gonna stop holding my breath and waiting for another decent series out of this franchise.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
There is not a single show I despise more than Jojo, while it&#039;s by no means the worst show on the planet, far from it, no show that I find to be of such poor quality gets this much praise, within the anime community Jojo is treated as a work of high art, when I browsed the review section of this particular season it was an almost constant stream of 9s and 10s, which baffled me, I don&#039;t understand how something so devoid of character and substance could get so much praise, I could say the same about the previous 4 parts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324498">
        but Part 5 seems to be the most highly praised part, at least of the anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
Well, I think this is completely undeserved, and I&#039;ll explain why I think it&#039;s of such poor quality.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start of with the most important part of any anime, the story. Now the story is fairly simple, Giorno Giovanna joins the mafia so he could take it over from the inside, stop the drug trade and become a &quot;Gang-star&quot;, this plot makes zero sense once you think about it more, the mafia IS a drug trade, so why would Giorno wanna stop it? It would make sense if he hated the mafia, but no, he holds a great deal of respect for it he just hates the current boss for..doing what the mafia is supposed to do? The whole plot seems like an excuse for a series of pointless fights, in fact, here&#039;s the best way I can describe the &quot;story&quot;: The gang goes to a location, they meet an enemy stand user, the user removes all but one of the characters from the fight and nearly kills the remaining one, that one character manages to turn the tide of the battle through a complicated series of events and kills the enemy stand user, then they travel to the next location, rinse and repeat for 38 episodes. I&#039;m serious, you could probably remove around 50-60% of the fights and nothing would change, most of the fights feel like filler, they don&#039;t advance the plot, they don&#039;t develop the characters, they serve no purpose other than to stall for time. Without spoiling too much, the ending is awful, after the fight with the main villain, that&#039;s it, the story just sort of ends with a 20-second scene with no lines, why couldn&#039;t Araki cut out, let&#039;s just say, the Clash/Talkin Head fight and use that time to create a proper ending that wraps up the story and characters properly? Because Araki doesn&#039;t know how to write characters, which leads into my next section.<br />
<br />
To put it simply, Araki has no idea how to write interesting characters, he can design interesting LOOKING characters and can give them interesting abilities, but as for their actual personalities...<br />
Let&#039;s start off with the main cast. Giorno is by far the least interesting Jojo, at least with Johnathan as cliched as he is, you can easily get a grasp on his personality, as for Giorno, he has none, in fact he rarely talks or interacts with other characters outside of fights, this is a common issue you&#039;ll see with the main cast, outside of maybe Narancia, characters barely say or do anything outside of when they&#039;re fighting, they feel less like characters and more like action figures, anyway back to Giorno, his motivation makes no sense, he wants to become a &quot;Gang-star&quot; because after protecting a mafia member the mafia helped him through his early life, but at the same time he wants to stop the drug trade, which is what the mafia does, it&#039;s like Giorno doesn&#039;t even know what the mafia is, and his supposed respect for it is the driving force behind the plot, why is this character so popular? He&#039;s completely forgettable and his motivation and goals make zero sense, I&#039;ve seen Pokemon characters that are more well written. Next we have Buccelati (or Buciarati), when he&#039;s introduced he&#039;s portrayed as creepy and cunning, then Giorno punches him a few times and he becomes this benevolent and caring boss, Buccelati is a little more interesting than Giorno but doesn&#039;t have much in terms of character outside of caring for the gang. Narancia is just Joseph from Part 3, his entire personality is that he&#039;s stupid and screams a lot, seriously about 80% of his dialogue is him screaming, riveting. Mista&#039;s sole defining personality trait is that he hates the number 4, that&#039;s it, there&#039;s really nothing more to him, by the way, if you plan on watching this show, count how many times Mista is either hit by his own bullets or is injured and has a fake-out death scene, this show&#039;s repetitiveness gives me a headache. Abbacchio COULD have been interesting, he has a tragic backstory and a character dynamic with Giorno, however the former is only brought up twice and doesn&#039;t really affect his character, and the latter is dropped after a few episodes, Araki had the opportunity to make a semi-interesting character but as usual, he wastes it. Fugo was also close to being a decent character, like Abbacchio, he has an interesting backstory, which actually does affect his character and gives him a reasonable motivation to join the mafia, his personality is more distinguishable than the others, but, Araki just... drops him halfway through and he&#039;s not really mentioned again aside from a brief cameo near the end, this is the most frustrating element of the series, Araki had the chance to write a very interesting character but then just, removes him from the story completely, this is just dreadful writing, I don&#039;t understand how a series that unceremoniously drops its only interesting character halfway through can be considered one of the all-time greats, not half-decent writer would waste an interesting character like that. Our last member of the main cast is Trish, she&#039;s a living plot device and feels more like a MacGuffin than a character until Araki randomly decides to give her stand powers near the end because I guess he got bored of his other characters? Finally, we have the main antagonist, Diavolo, he&#039;s one of the worst villains I&#039;ve seen in anime and I think it comes down to the fact that Araki decides to properly introduce him 5 episodes before the end of series, he&#039;s seen before in 1 or 2 episodes but he&#039;s unnamed and is shrouded in darkness so it doesn&#039;t really count, the whole split-personality gimmick could&#039;ve worked but it&#039;s really only plot-relevant once and Diavolo himself doesn&#039;t really play off his other persona,  Diavolo is very uninteresting, at least with Dio, he at least had the personality of a stock maniacal villain, Diavolo has no character, he&#039;s just evil for the sake of evil, in fact near the end his end-goal switches from hiding all traces of his identity to taking over the world once the stand arrow is reintroduced. I apologise if most of those descriptions were fairly brief, but it&#039;s hard to write long or well-detailed descriptions on characters I find this uninteresting.<br />
<br />
I hope now you can at least see why I personally dislike this series and maybe it&#039;ll even encourage to look at it more critically, I don&#039;t have much to say on the animation or sound design, it&#039;s passable but feels much cheaper than Parts 1-4.<br />
<br />
Overall, I don&#039;t see any reason to watch Part 5 if you haven&#039;t yet, it&#039;s completely devoid of character or substance, and the plot feels like an excuse for a bunch of drawn-out fight scenes.<br />
<br />

    After 4 seasons of mindless battles, finally enough is enough. As someone that really liked the first season, it pains me to say that I&#039;m finally putting this series down for awhile. While David Production has given this series great treatment, sadly it can&#039;t be saved at this point.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Generally the Jojo series start out with some goal, and then endless battles lead up to it. That&#039;s the same here for this season, as our protagonist wants to change his hometown and ends up battling countless foes to get there, mostly meaningless battles. Aside from that Jojo doesn&#039;t really have much of a story. If action

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305789">
        entertains you enough however, you will enjoy it if you don&#039;t mind the inconsistencies and turn your brain off. I&#039;m one that generally needs more intense fights or story focus to enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I judge art by thinking &quot;Would I want every series to look like this?&quot; Otherwise you can&#039;t tell good apart from unique. While the art is well done and decent quality, I cannot say it would be enjoyable if it wasn&#039;t just for the fact that I haven&#039;t seen it much before.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound quality is decent. The ending theme doesn&#039;t really fit and some characters have very annoying voices but the rest is good overall. The battle sounds are probably what matter most.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Jojo takes time to develop briefly each of its characters, though not as deep as many series as it focuses more on battles than development. There&#039;s nothing particularly special about the characters either this far into the series and they are not memorable in any sense other than just having a typical characters for the jojo series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Literally one of the lowest possible by this point, I just can&#039;t enjoy meaningless battles but it seems a lot of people do. If you like action and different characters showing up all the time then this is for you maybe.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
This series started with a lot of promise but ended up as nothing more than pathetic.

    Italian Gangsters!!! Did I get your attention...?<br />
<br />
This is the 5th story arc from the long running manga series, JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki. Like the other parts of JoJo, This part has a different main cast, atmosphere and themes from the others.<br />
 <br />
This part of JoJo, has a much more serious atmosphere. Every fight is to the death, and the main cast doesn&#039;t get away from anything without consequences. There are some subtle religious symbolism and if I could describe the story in 1 word, it would be fate.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in the country of Italy so the world is really colorful and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310591">
        beautiful. We visit various locations such as Naples, Venice, Pompei and Rome.<br />
The characters are very believable and well-written, and the character development has also been done very good.<br />
Even the smallest villains are very interesting and beautifully created.<br />
The stand fights are, as always, really smart and filled with tension.<br />
It might look like a straightforward story, but it is very coherent and has a lot of complexities and unlike most of the works out there.<br />
<br />
Despite all the odds against this adaptaion, The animation is certainly if not the best, one of the best-looking ones in the series. The animators might not be as talented as some other famous studios but you can tell that the animators at David Productions have done their work with love and passion.<br />
<br />
The music is absolutely jaw dropping! Yugo Kanno has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this anime to fully express every moment in the story with beauty. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure Golden Wind is one of the most different anime you can watch out here, and even if you aren&#039;t a fan of shounen anime, you should definitely give it a try!<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.

    EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES, WAKING UP WANTING MORE JOJO<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome to the fifth iteration of the amazing, bizarre adventure of JoJo&#039;s. With the long awaited adaptation Vento Aureo being a third of the way through and personally being one of my favorite parts of the series I feel obliged to put my two cents forward on this wild ride. With out further adieu, here&#039;s my review of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind (Vento Aureo)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Starting off with the story we are introduced with Koichi trying to find our protagonist, Giorno Giovanna, the bastard son of Dio. Giorno has mostly led a troubled life with abusive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299391">
        parents until one day he helps out a gangster which in turn more or less 180&#039;s his life. With this sudden change for Giorno, he takes it upon himself to give back to others who have been down on their luck. He then one day runs into Bruno Bucciarati, which after discovering Bucciarati has a stand himself and then fights him comes to lean on him for help since he finds out quickly that Bucciarati is out to clean the streets himself. After going through initiation with Polpo, Giorno is introduced the rest of Bucciarati posse and thusly they go out and do orders for the Passione&#039;s boss meanwhile finding a way to get to him. The story of Vento Aureo as a whole, is by no means revolutionary, but it&#039;s still highly entertaining and action packed. Action packed JoJo is JoJo at its best if you ask me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, the art of JoJo is pristine and fits the vibe of the series to a T. It&#039;s a hybrid of the Stardust Crusaders rough, gritty tone and Diamond is Unbreakable&#039;s flashy, contemporary design. The animation is very crisp and all  the battle scenes are as fluid as you could ask. David Pro nailed it yet again and it&#039;s a treat to watch every week. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The OST is nothing short of fitting with part 5, we get a top notch OP to start off with Fighting Gold, bringing back Coda is great. The synth work in itself is fantastic and the song as a whole gives off a James Bond vibe. The character theme&#039;s are great and fit with the characters personalities. My god, the Prince remix for the Torture Dance was downright perfect. We didn&#039;t deserve how hard David Pro for us, but thank the anime gods they did. I was personally a bit skeptical on the ED at first, but after finishing the manga for pt5, it honestly fits in a strange way. Go figure, it&#039;s JoJo after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Jo bro&#039;s this time around are some of the best we&#039;ve got yet. While I don&#039;t love them AS much as SC&#039;s bro&#039;s, all of them on part 5 have something good to offer and to make the experience entertaining. As I stated earlier, minus their backstories, the motivations between Giorno and Bucciarati are similar in more ways then one so I&#039;ll lump the two together. Both have a strong sense of justice, meanwhile Giorno HAS A DREAM, they want what&#039;s best for the community as a whole, especially the children. I&#039;m not really going to touch up on Giorno&#039;s stand as it is a very multi layered stand, that quite frankly does a lot of shenanigans, especially later on down the line. Bucciarati&#039;s stand, Sticky Fingers, is a stand which opens up inanimate objects, people, areas, amongst other things to various things like placing objects or making a quick escape. Next up we have Mista, a quirky young man who has a phobia over the number four. Mista somewhat falls into comic relief sometimes along with Narancia since it seems like those two attract trouble the most. Both of them are basically just big ol&#039; goobers. Mista has a rather gray area stand. It more or less boils down to a long range stand that he has a symbiotic relationship with. My goodness Sex Pistols is an adorable stand though, truly the best boys. Narancia, the youngest outside of Giorno, is an ill-tempered kinda dope-ish kid who was betrayed by his older brother figure which lead him to a life of poverty and nearly dying himself until Fugo introduced him to Bucciarati. His stand, Aerosmith, is a remote controlled type cropduster airplane which can shoot a machine gun and missiles at his target. Along with his stand he can track them down with a radar system. Fugo is an intellectual whom had trouble expressing his emotions until he just cracked on a professor who was trying to sexually assault him. It&#039;s clear to say he&#039;s the brains of the group and was on a path to success until he boiled over, even though he was absolutely in the right to defend himself. His stand, Purple Haze is a true pinpoint reflection of his mental state. A mutli-faceted being that has insane amounts of power that he has trouble concealing and has a quirky neat freak tucked away inside. Lastly of the bro&#039;s we have Abbacchio. Abbacchio can come off as a huge ass, but this is mainly due to the mistakes he made in the past, so he has a hard time letting others in and trusting them. I can be hard on him as a character, but I /get/ why he does what he does to the characters he knows little about, like Giorno. To round the group up we have Trish. There&#039;s not much I can say about her, due to the anime being up to only up to episode 15 and I&#039;m absolutely not going to spoil it for the anime only fans. Basically all that&#039;s been said is that she&#039;s the boss&#039;s daughter and Giorno and the Jo bro&#039;s have been tasked to protect her up until a certain point in time. I tried my damndest to not spoil things about these character since I truly love each of them in their own ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros- <br />
Exciting and action packed story <br />
Great art/animation<br />
Great characters<br />
On point OST<br />
Fantastic fan service David Pro added in (i.e the expanded Torture Dance)<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons-<br />
Gotta wait a week for every episode<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My final rating, due to personal bias is a 10. I love JoJo and especially part 5. Hope you guys enjoy the rest of the ride.

    If I could recommend a show that isn&#039;t too long but has a great story with characters that go through hell and back for each other while just deliver just an overall great experience I would recommend Golden Wind.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
<br />
While I think the story is the weakest point of the whole series let me tell you that I do not think it is a bad thing. There are a few things that could be changed to make it a better experience, but don&#039;t want to list here for spoiler reasons. But overall the story is extremely solid which gives the show a great backbone.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
Personally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335140">
        I love all of the styles that JoJo&#039;s has throughout all of the different parts, but Part 5&#039;s is a new refined style that really gives the story and characters the best look possible.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Girono&#039;s Theme. Fighting Gold. The Torture Dance song. Uragirimonono Requiem. Incursione. Bruno&#039;s Theme. That is all I have to say.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t stress enough how much I love each member of Bruno&#039;s group. They all have their own individual strengths and weaknesses and they all lean on each other to complete their common goal. I think they are all well written and have good development throughout the show. While they do develop I love how they stay true to their roots and where they come from and how that makes each individual act the way they do. I also enjoy the various different villains throughout the adventure. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything because a lot of the anime is spent in mystery, but just know they are great.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t stress enough how much I loved this show. Just thinking about it, hearing a certain line, or even a snip-it of some of the music is enough to give me butterflies about the amazing journey part 5 was.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
I hope everyone has enough patience to one day consume this show because I believe it is simply a masterpiece.

After watching/reading every completed JoJo part, I can confidently say that Vento Aureo/Golden Wind is my favorite by a good margin. I don&#039;t know where Araki pulled this story from, but almost everything about Golden Wind is better than the previous parts (with a few exceptions that I&#039;ll go over). <br />
<br />
 - Story -<br />
<br />
Araki&#039;s approach to storytelling in this part is incredibly refreshing and a great change of pace. Unlike Parts 3 and 4, Golden Wind has a story that continually builds upon itself from beginning to end with stand battles between key story moments and great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329153">
        twists/turns throughout. Also, just the idea of taking over Italy&#039;s largest mafia organization is awesome to me, and the steps they take to get there are great. <br />
<br />
The first act is amazing because of how well it sets up the structure of the mafia org, Giorno and Bucciarati&#039;s goals and how they have to go about achieving them. For real, by the end of episode 4 (which is still one of the most awesome things a main JoJo has ever done), I was completely hooked and Golden Wind continued to impress me. <br />
<br />
The biggest complaint I hear about Part 5 is that its final act is anticlimactic, but I honestly disagree. I can&#039;t really go into detail without spoiling anything, but the main villain&#039;s ability combined with each party&#039;s goal makes the ending really tense in my opinion. The epilogue wraps things up nicely and gives a good satisfactory feeling.<br />
<br />
My one complaint with this story is that characters don&#039;t die when they seem like they should (like for real, Mista got shot with his own gun more than he shot other people), and the deaths that do happen just seem really sudden and out of nowhere. It&#039;s like they just couldn&#039;t die until it was convenient for the plot. But aside from that, I think this story is fantastic.<br />
<br />
 - Character - <br />
<br />
Golden Wind has my favorite cast of characters in all of JoJo. Everything member of team Bucciarati is awesome because of how well they complement each other. I can honestly say that I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a single annoying character in this part. Not only is everyone in the main cast unique, but they all have their own backstories that explain why they act the way they do. Take Abbachio as an example. Throughout this story, he is very distrusting of and rude to Giorno, and we learn later that he distrusts others because his blind trust of a criminal got his old partner killed. Also, Mista&#039;s stand has its own personality that gave the show some nice comic relief.<br />
<br />
Even the minor characters like Giorno&#039;s hero and Polpo have interesting personalities and great dialogue.<br />
<br />
Also, Giorno Giovanna is my favorite JoJo protagonist because of how he acts. As the son of Dio&#039;s head and Jonathan&#039;s body, he is the perfect combination of the two. With the same sense of justice as Jonathan and the same cruelty as Dio, Giorno really lives up to both of their names.<br />
<br />
My absolute favorite character, however, is Bruno Bucciarati. With the way he leads and protects everyone on his team, the versatility of his stand, and the way he outsmarts his enemies, Bucciarati is (in my opinion) the most awesome likable badass character in all of JoJo. If anyone foolish enough dares to attack his children, Bucciarati will Sticky Finger their asses immediately. As shown especially in episodes 20 and 21.<br />
<br />
I might say that the humor isn&#039;t quite as good as it was in Part 2, but there are still some hilarious moments.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I&#039;ll just mention the main antagonist, who is also a great villain. I can&#039;t really explain why without spoiling anything, but he is personality-wise the most unique JoJo villain, and his busted stand makes the second half of this part tense and refreshing.<br />
<br />
 - Fights - <br />
<br />
In terms of pure stand battles, I think Golden Wind does it the best. While it may not reach the highs of Jotaro vs Dio or Josuke vs Kira, the overall quality of fights combined with how well they&#039;re paced in the story make them the most interesting to me. Unlike with other parts, I can honestly say that they&#039;re isn&#039;t a single bad/boring fight in this part.<br />
<br />
Araki gets even more creative with the abilities here, as there are so many diverse abilities and designs. Not to mention, each stand of the main cast (aside from probably Fugo) has its unique ability utilized well. For example, Sticky Fingers (Bucciarati) has a very simple ability of putting zippers on objects, but it&#039;s used in so many different ways that it feels like one of the most fleshed out stands in the series.<br />
<br />
 - Art - <br />
<br />
I swear that Araki and David Productions is a match made in heaven. The character designs in Part 5 are even more epic and over the top than in previous parts. The art style increases in quality each part, and Golden Wind is no exception. Everything from the movement in fights to the swapping color palettes is phenomenally animated. Bless DP.<br />
<br />
 - Sound -<br />
<br />
As always, David Productions made everything in GW sound perfect. The soundtrack is (in my opinion) the best it&#039;s ever been, the voice acting is great, and the sound effects seem realistic. DP got especially creative with the sounds of different stands. Gold Experience, Sticky Fingers, and King Crimson are just a few examples of stands with creative sounds.<br />
<br />
As of right now, the English dub is on episode 13, and even if it&#039;s not as great as the original, the acting and dialogue is pretty good so far.<br />
<br />
  - Conclusion - <br />
<br />
I wanna know what changed between the short time period between Part 4 and 5, because Araki&#039;s writing quality improved so much that it&#039;s insane. Combine that with the fact that David Production did their best work yet and you get the best season of JoJo thus far.

    I&#039;m a sucker for a good Jojo anime, but this would be the first one I have formally reviewed.<br />
<br />
Vento Aureo is outstanding.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve only seen bits and pieces of the original manga, but I&#039;ve heard that the anime is a fairly impressive adaptation. It even goes as far to flesh out scenes that were considered &quot;relatively minor&quot; in the manga as they were sort of like Araki&#039;s personal joke &#039;easter eggs&#039; as it were.<br />
<br />
I mean, the Torture Dance? Oh my goodness. I was not prepared for a full length sequence of that.<br />
<br />
An immaculate work of beautifully crafted storytelling.<br />

Gorgeous visuals (though prone to David Production&#039;s occasional odd

        artstyle choices from time to time.)<br />
<br />
An extremely memorable and even addictive soundtrack that really sticks with the viewer long after watching.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not entirely sure if there was a part of this anime I didn&#039;t like. It&#039;s one of the extremely rare exceptions to &quot;I will never give a 10/10 rating to something&quot; rule.<br />
<br />
So please. Araki, David Production, congratulations.<br />
You have earned this 10 from me.

    A near perfect action adventure superhero/fantasy anime. The soundtrack is straight up bomb, there is a reason it is used so often in memes and videos. There&#039;s no shortage of epic &quot;cliche&quot; anime moments that will make u stand up in your seat, and its hella action packed so you won&#039;t be bored a minute. The music and action scenes just synergize together so perfectly to create hype and excitement for the audience. Each episode is just bursting with plot twists, explosive moments, confusion, and epic acts of heroism.  The acting is perfect, the music is perfect, and the story while simple is actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361689">
        pretty captivating. Some episodes really hit hard. Surprisingly, there are several quite emotional scenes in the anime that actually play very well into the story. You can tell, everything that happens in JoJo part 5 matters. There isn&#039;t a filler episode, the whole time you can see the objective and how they are getting closer. The interactions between the characters make it fell as if a real group of friends is on their own journey against the stand using mafia in Italy. Seriously, the story and action is on point. The only gripe I&#039;ve had is that the animation can be kind of low quality in certain scenes.<br />

Overall: 9.9/10 anime

    This is one of the best anime&#039;s i have ever seen this anime is very creative due to the amount of stands and how each of them have unique abilities and the characters are also very unique besides carne since that dude looks mad weird and pesci but he kinda had his moment so yeah. but Giorno is a very good character in my opinion since he has a dream and he keeps maturing as the story moves on and diavolo is a good villian since he has a very powerful stand and he has very strong motives. The side characters are really good my

        favorite is Bucciarati, everyone loves him he is a good person and his stand is basic but unique in its own way he uses it very well and he finds new methods to win each time he has to fight.
