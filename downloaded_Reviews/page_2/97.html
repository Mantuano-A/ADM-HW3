    “I love who I am.”<br />
<br />
The final line of the opening’s chorus, as well as the ending’s titular “Believe in you”, form the thesis and backbone of this season of Re:Zero. This cour shifted its focus away from the usual Subaru character study, delving more into worldbuilding, developing its side cast and delivering its core messages.<br />
<br />
Why does Re:Zero, within the abundant sea of modern isekai, stand out like a shining beacon of light 5 years later? Some will argue it’s the breadth of its “best girl” selection, others will say it’s the impactful thriller elements. Re:Zero’s true strength lies, if you were to ask me, in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386318">
        the humanity of its characters and the messages it imparts. These aspects are in the limelight in this cour. The previously established Trials mechanic is used to explore characters’ histories and motivations, all the while sprinkling in setups upon setups leading up to the grand picture of the series. Subaru, as the protagonist, takes a back seat; he lends a hand to the other characters, gives them a push, and yet it remains up to them to make a choice and save themselves. Yes; Re:Zero Season 2 is about self-reliance — but it is also about the fact that when you do decide to take that first step, whether it’s to change, to save or improve yourself, there are people out there who will cheer you on. The message of this cour is a deeply positive one, hence the show momentarily forsaking its usual gimmick. It’s also a very satisfactory watch, after the feeling of deadlock within the first cour, as the characters smash through insurmountable odds set up by the charismatic villain of Part 1.<br />
<br />
Due to the nature of the show, some spoilers will follow.<br />
<br />
Cour 1 revealed the antagonist for this season to be Roswaal, behind both the Sanctuary situation and the mansion attack. I would, however, say that beyond specific characters, the true antagonist in this arc is a symbolic, or abstract one — the idea of “stagnation”, which happens to be behind every obstacle of the arc. Roswaal is stuck in 400 years past, believing in the permanence of feelings and chained to the past, intent on fostering that same weakness which he believes exists in others to manipulate them; Elsa is on a desperate hunt to recapture a feeling of warmth from her past; Beatrice remains bound to a 400 year old contract; Garfiel is terrified of the world being too big for him to protect everyone and decides that the Sanctuary should remain closed off. Re:Zero acknowledges that the status quo is attractive — is it not normal to stay attached to the beautiful Witch who saved your life, to want to recapture a feeling of relief from one’s past, or to want to keep your world small where you can control and protect everything? — before pointing out that it is also deeply self-destructive and dangerous, from the impending doom in the form of a carnivorous rabbit horde to the mental degradation of Roswaal and Elsa’s characters. All of these ideas are conveyed with no shortage of symbolism, the most striking one for me being the use of Beatrice and Roswaal’s Gospels.<br />
<br />
In order to overcome these barriers, Re:Zero asks its characters to find the balance between “dangerous self-reliance” and “toxic dependence”. Subaru, unable to overcome anything by himself despite his abuse of Return by Death in the first cour, realizes something in the second thanks to a friend; the gears of victory start spinning only when he reaches a hand out to his allies and starts valuing his own life. The main heroine Emilia takes the opposite path, beginning her growth only when her dependence on Puck and Subaru is broken. From there, this hero-heroine duo constitute the heart of the anime, spurring everyone else into action. Characters argue and fight; ideals clash, sparks fly. This would be around the part where the average viewer would call the dialogue overlong and repetitive, without any effort on their end to connect with, or at least understand the situations at hand.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t disagree more.<br />
<br />
The dialogue forms the heart of the arc; when a character speaks, their lines aren’t artificially tailored for some 3rd party viewer. The core ideas, themes and motivations aren’t spoonfed; they’re inbetween the lines, asking a degree of investment and attentiveness from the viewers. Camera angles assist the viewer in finding meaning, if not to simply immerse them into the scene, like the series’ iconic eye reflection shots that convey “understanding” or “trust”. The argument between Subaru and Emilia in EP40 is probably the strongest display of that particular strength of the series, from the sheer rawness of it to how real it felt as an unreasonable clash of emotions, all the while allowing the two characters to overcome their emotional hurdles. It wouldn’t be difficult to argue that the Sanctuary premise, and the mansion situation at hand, are only present to allow all of these clashes and character explorations to take place, and the attentive viewer will most definitely appreciate this setting that goes beyond the isekai fantasy norm.<br />
<br />
From a purely script-writing perspective, a lot of these moments overshadow the first half of Season 1, and come close to even the legendary, all-dialogue episode 18. This is all, sadly, from a purely script-writing perspective. While the directing throughout the show is generally good (with sadly more dips than usual in this cour — and no, this isn’t referring to the liberal use of filters, which I didn’t find too bothersome as someone used to such things), the animation is insufficient to carry the weight of certain moments. Anime is, first and foremost, a storytelling medium, but even the best story will fall flat if poorly translated on screen. While Part 2 certainly doesn’t fall to that level, the feeling that something is *missing*, or to be more precise that the characters are too static to properly elevate the scene is certainly there. It also certainly doesn’t help that the downgraded character designs, making most of the male characters hard to look at compared to Season 1, have carried over from S2P1. Re:Zero has had segments even heavier in dialogue than this cour before (again, the pure dialogue-heavy EP18 comes to mind), but a lack of dynamic animation on top of the increased complexity of the writing will inevitably lead to some false perceptions for the average viewer. These production-related issues, along with some cuts to the source that may negatively affect the flow of scenes for some, make it so that I cannot give this a perfect score; nevertheless, White Fox persevered admirably, trying their utmost to stay faithful to the source with consistent 30-minute episodes, this entire season reaching up to 33 episodes disguised as 25. While cracks in the production are present, series director Watanabe managed to balance out ambition with a schedule that didn’t require a crunch to the finish line like other popular gems of this season. But I digress.<br />
<br />
Making up for the more static animation is a soundtrack that may just match AoT in its movie-like feel; the “fantasy” aspect of the series shines through in almost every track. The voice acting is stunning, from Yuusuke Kobayashi’s emotional performances to Rie Takahashi’s more and more confident and energetic voice, matching the arc of her character. Let’s also not forget to praise Takehito Koyasu, who managed to convey every facet of Roswaal’s character with skill. To top it off, this season came with two character insert songs, both used fittingly and beautifully. In a season as focused in fleshing out its cast through numerous backstories, character arcs and climactic moments, these are some of the most essential components, and I can only be glad the production remained stellar on that front.<br />
<br />
Overall, if I had to sum up in a sentence what this arc of Re:Zero imparted in me, it would be, once again, “when you finally decide to take the first step to make a change, there will be people willing to help and encourage you along the way”. Subaru isn’t strong, he isn’t even cooler, but he isn’t alone anymore— just that fact is enough to change the tone of the series into something more positive. You cannot remain dependent on others, but avoiding human relationships with those around you will also get you nowhere.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, I think what Re:Zero Season 2 does is worth lending an ear to.

    Bravo, Re:Zero. Bravo. First of all, I would like to give a huge thanks to the staff at Studio White Fox for giving us such a passionate adaptation of Re:Zero Season 2, to the Author, Tappei Nagatsuki for writing this brilliant series, to the Voice Actors for their incredible performances as the characters, and everyone who worked on this show. As a huge fan of the series, seeing Re:Zero Season 2 receiving such an amazing adaptation like no other, it&#039;s honestly like a dream come true, and I couldn&#039;t have asked for more.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, let&#039;s proceed to the review. Re:Zero Season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386308">
        2 is back after an agonizing 3-month break, honestly was the longest 3 months of my life, while I had a lot of Fall shows to indulge myself in at the time, none were able to fill the empty void inside my heart left behind when Re:Zero S2 Part 1 ended, and now starts another agonizing wait for Season 3, I&#039;m truly going to miss watching this every week.<br />
<br />
This season starts, literally immediately where Part 1 left off with the Otto punch of friendship and giving Subaru the confidence he needs to overcome the problems Roswaal meticulously set up this season. With a new profound determination to not die and have the people that care about him suffer because of him, he resolves to save everyone in this final loop and makes a bet with Roswaal, it was a long shot, the stakes are high, it was risky, but Subaru was ready to take that risk.<br />
<br />
A common criticism of Re:Zero is that the story focuses too much on Subaru that it leaves no room for other characters to shine, that was true for Season 1 and Season 2 Part 1 that was focused primarily on Subaru&#039;s development, Season 2 Part 2 fixes this problem and gives every single character a much-needed character development and each and every one of them gets to have their time to shine this season. Whether it&#039;d be Otto being best bro, Emilia and Garfiel learning to overcome their traumatic past, Ram wanting to save Roswaal from his 400-year obsession, Beatrice finally letting go and breaking off the shackles of her past that bound her soul preventing her from moving forward, and this.<br />
<br />
This is what makes Re:Zero special, it&#039;s not just a story about Subaru but everyone else around him, it&#039;s a story of him starting a new life from zero, how the actions of others affect him and how his own actions affect others. Re:Zero is not a story about suffering, nor is it a story about being the strongest, killing the demon lord, and getting a sweet ass harem. No, Re:Zero is a genuine and emotional story of growth and self-improvement, learning to accept and love yourself, everyone has flaws, no one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, but that&#039;s not a bad thing, it&#039;s precisely because you are imperfect, that you have flaws that make you human.<br />
<br />
I feel like a lot of people have a bias against modern shows, and I get a lot of people will disagree. But Re:Zero IS a DEEP series, deep in the sense of its emotional and psychological themes, there are genuine underlying messages portrayed in the show, and I have mentioned some of them already in my previous paragraph. One of the central themes of Season 2 is the idea of obsession and stagnation. Roswaal is the embodiment of this ideology, and every character in the series shows a part of this in their respective personality, they are stuck at a point in time unable to move forward, unable to change.<br />
<br />
A lot of people complain about Season 2 being stuck in the sanctuary for 25 episodes but that is the point, that symbolizes stagnation and directly parallels the stagnation of some of the characters, they are stuck in time, in one place, and after this season are able to move past all of that and change, that is the main theme of this season. These are examples of those characters; Roswaal&#039;s 400-year obsession with Echidna, Ryuzu Shima&#039;s wish to respect Ryuzu Meyer&#039;s sacrifice, Garfiel&#039;s trauma that leads to him to hate the outside world, resulting in him resolving to keep the Sanctuary closed off forever. Emilia is bound by her traumatic past, Beatrice&#039;s stubbornness to keep her 400-year contract with Echidna, to wait for a person that doesn&#039;t exist.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have also been complaining about the pacing of this season, I don&#039;t understand why. They are completely missing the sheer significance and importance of this arc, before you start complaining about the arc being so long, ask yourself. Why is this arc in particular so long? Firstly, it sets up important plot points and mysteries for the future. Secondly, give some context and revelations of some questions we&#039;ve been asking back in Season 1, and finally, It serves as a turning point for the Emilia camp as a whole. If Season 1 focused entirely on Subaru and his development, then Season 2 focuses on building up and strengthening the Emilia camp through character growth for the side characters. The Emilia Camp was all over the place during Season 1, and they aren&#039;t really united and especially Emilia herself was a problem, she didn&#039;t possess the necessary qualities that a Ruler should have, no solid foundation, this Arc not only develops Emilia&#039;s character, but it also serves to develop and unite the rest of the Emilia camp that will help and support her in the future.<br />
<br />
Emilia back in Season 1 as we know is a very immature person, she was very naive and had very idealistic goals for the Royal Selection, as she was then, she was unfit of becoming the Ruler, and that&#039;s a big problem. She doesn&#039;t have the best leadership and has problems with self-confidence because of discrimination she has faced due to her Half-Elf lineage and looking exactly like the Witch of Envy. Even the determination she lacks, unlike the rest of the Royal Candidates. However this season she has learned to become more mature and start to become better as a person, slowly becoming someone who can lead the country in the future. Through the 1st Trial she found the resolve and determination to make her wishes come true, through the 2nd Trial she learned to fully accept herself and to not be afraid of what others think of her, and finally, through the 3rd Trial, she gained the confidence to overcome the disaster that may come.<br />
<br />
The characters are the best part of Re:Zero. They feel genuine and real, not in the sense that their personalities are realistic, but instead in their character flaws, and psychology. The author gives a lot of thought into them, even the characters that may seem very insignificant at first glance.<br />
<br />
Apart from the characters, the story is solid as well. Season 2&#039;s plot is complex and tightly written, unlike the first 3 arcs in Season 1 which were more simplistic and straightforward. Part 1 served as the build-up phase by introducing the central mysteries and problems like Elsa, Meili, Mansion Problems, Rabbits, Witches, and Roswaal&#039;s true intentions. While Part 2 is the emotional climax and development, and it was well worth all the build-up.<br />
<br />
The songs and OST this season is amazing, the opening and ending are both really good too bad they&#039;re not played much often, we also got some really nice Insert Songs by Emilia and Ram&#039;s VAs, and some new tracks courtesy of Kenichiro Suehiro and are honestly some of the best of the series. Animation is a step up over Part 1, might not be the same quality as Season 1 but there is one fight, in particular, this season that I believe is the best-animated fight of the series thus far, Kazuhiro Ota is a god, and is carrying all the fight scenes on his back.<br />
<br />
All in all, this season of Re:Zero has been spectacular and I feel it far surpasses Season 1 in almost every aspect that&#039;s not animation. It has everything that made Season 1 so good and improved upon it and also fixes a lot of problems people had with Season 1. This deserves a 10/10 rating. If you&#039;ve lasted until the end, thank you very much for reading, and I hope you liked my review. Have a good day!

    &quot;Re:Zero is boring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three words you&#039;ve likely heard before or said yourself. But why? Why do people find Re:Zero boring? If you already love Re:Zero, I hope this review will help you understand the other side of the audience. If you don&#039;t love Re:Zero, I hope to provide some clarity as to why.<br />
<br />
From my observation, most people who dislike Re:Zero are anime-only viewers, whereas the dedicated fans have read the source material: This tells us two things:<br />
1. The story, characters, and themes hook specific viewers to the point of delving into the meaty source material (which includes 11 manga volumes, one video game, four character-focused side

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386388">
        story light novels, and a total of 26 light novel volumes). <br />
2. The viewers who don&#039;t get hooked by the story will lack the background knowledge to make the characters more nuanced. <br />
<br />
I fall within the latter category. While watching the first season back in 2016, I despised it and rated it 3/10 overall. I made a concerted effort to understand the fanbase&#039;s point of view by supplementing missing information with Youtube analyses and Wiki articles; that&#039;s why I immensely enjoyed Re:Zero despite the show&#039;s flaws. After stewing with my thoughts, I&#039;ve concluded the show itself overall has a subpar presentation, despite providing intriguing and nuanced characters.<br />
<br />
First of all, the screenplay is bloated. Most of the characters talk the same. I don&#039;t mean they have the same voice, but the same way of speaking, which makes it obvious the same person wrote them. Of course, they were all written by Tappei Nagatsuki. However, it breaks my immersion when every character speaks esoterically with additional words and phrases added on top of what is, at times, a simple script. Characters such as Roswaal and Beatrice demand to speak superfluously because for narrative purposes. Roswaal speaks in riddles because he is manipulative, enigmatic, and a liar. Beatrice hides her anxiety and abandonment issues by not cutting to the chase and saying &quot;I suppose&quot; at the end of every sentence—it&#039;s not simply a cute quirk. Some reasons become apparent with time.<br />
<br />
Side characters such as Regulus Corneas, the eccentric and terrifying archbishop, speaks like a conservative senator attempting to filibuster by spouting rhetoric about &quot;free speech&quot; and his &quot;rights&quot; before mercilessly killing innocents. He does so because his psychopathy and hypocrisy befit the archbishop of greed—the reasons are very clever but entirely missing in the anime. The choice to leave out this and other content threatens to obscure each scene&#039;s meaning. To the uninformed viewer, all of these behaviors, meaningful or not, are annoying. It doesn&#039;t help that when the more sane characters speak, the dialogue is delivered slowly and with a drab presentation. The production is to blame for this. <br />
<br />
That brings us to the second issue: animation: There is barely any. When it really counts, such as the combat scenes with Garfiel, Elsa, and memorable moments in Emilia&#039;s backstory, it looks good—but for the rest of the time, it&#039;s hard to sit through. Frames freeze for minutes on end, with simplified versions of the beautiful character designs. There is motion, but the animators rely heavily on motion tweens, camera pans, jump cuts, and digital zooming. White Fox only drew a few angles of the main casts&#039; face, so whenever the camera is at an angle that deviates from the norm, the characters look messy and off models. Often, fans of the series are frowned upon for criticizing the lackluster animation, but I believe they&#039;re 100% valid. If these people complain about the cafe scenes in SAO, yet they ignore similar problems in Re:Zero, they&#039;re hypocrites. <br />
<br />
In this case, they&#039;re not at a table, but somewhere: In front of the Sanctuary and the forest. Episodes go by, and people will be in the same place talking. Whether they&#039;re telling a story, explaining their secret motivations, or telling a story someone told them. If you&#039;ve already gotten hooked by the characters, the information you&#039;ll learn is fascinating.<br />
<br />
Thankfully for me, I am invested. My favorite characters, Garfiel and Otto, perhaps got the best side-stories barring Emilia&#039;s trials. Garfiel yells to compensate for his short height on the surface. Due to developments, his earlier actions got recontextualized. He has a grudge against his mother, who left him behind. He believes nothing will get better, even if he leaves the Sanctuary. Letting people go would be admitting he can&#039;t protect them all. Even though the animation was as bad as usual, it still pulled my heartstrings enough to make me cry. If you told me Re:Zero would make me cry four years ago, I would&#039;ve laughed in your face—and that&#039;s why I think it&#039;s worth putting in the effort to understand why people like the characters so much. I acknowledge the characters are motivated by friends and family, and that&#039;s not very complex writing. However, it is in keeping with the show&#039;s themes. It tackles the cycle of abuse, trauma, grief throughout multiple character arcs. If Re:Zero did not have this thematic throughline, I would&#039;ve been more critical of its simplistic aspects. <br />
<br />
Another gripe I have with the director is the use of comedy; I like the occasional quips and humor, but sometimes it falls flat. When Subaru interrupts dialogue to yell or one of the girls squeals like a VTuber, I can&#039;t help but roll my eyes. This kind of humor may be suitable for most people, but for me, it only detracted from the show.<br />
<br />
Intillialy, I despised Subaru for how he betrayed Emilia&#039;s trust in episode 13 of season 1; nevertheless, he has indeed grown. Nearly every one of my wishes for his character, and everyone else&#039;s, came true. Emilia claimed the center stage and had her own agency, for once, and Subaru provided emotional support rather than overshadowing her accomplishments. I will always decry his objectifying of her, especially when attempting to get taken seriously, but I believe the author will remedy this issue in the future. <br />
<br />
This was my favorite season of Re:Zero. On a surface level analysis, I could point to the happy ending; it scrapped the Return By Death plot mechanic, Emilia had a heartfelt backstory, and how they saved violence and gore for critical scenes. Ultimately, what really made this season was the leaps and strides in character development. Even for the passive viewers, you will likely find the ending of Re:Zero Part 2 worth sticking around for. I&#039;m in a difficult predicament—where I both love the characters, but multiple aspects hinder my enjoyment of the show overall. The truth is, it is more enjoyable for me to talk about Re:Zero, and analyze its complex characters than it is to watch it. For that reason, it failed to meet my expectations.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
(TLDR at the bottom, thanks for reading.)<br />
<br />
I used to have a hard time talking about my opinions of re:zero as a whole. I liked the first season, while it had some issues I liked the overall ideas the show had, the return by death ability was conceptually interesting and the white whale was also interesting. But I hated the second season, I couldn&#039;t say I hated re:zero because of the first season, but I couldn&#039;t say I liked it either. I no longer have this issue.<br />
<br />
I hate re:zero.<br />
<br />
I hate how nothing meaningful ever happens. I hate how most of the show is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386356">
        just the characters just describing the plot. I hate whenever there is an issue the characters just talk about it and not use the medium of animation to make this more interesting. I hate how when something does happen it means nothing. I hate how the show is constantly giving unimportant characters backstories. I hate how Otto was not an important character yet they dedicate an entire episode to his backstory. I hate how Otto has no role in the story and any existing character to fill it yet he is inserted into every scene regardless. I hate the bugs in Otto&#039;s backstory that haven&#039;t been seen in the anime before but are now plot-relevant because of some contrived reason. I hate how they stretch three volumes of the light novel into 12 episodes killing any pace the series had and making the show unbearably slow. I hate how Garfeil&#039;s sanctuary trial is just backstory. I hate episode 4 is a flashback and episode 5 starts with a different flashback before continuing the flashback from the previous episodes. I hate that conversation that Subaru and Emilia have before the kiss. I hate Ram&#039;s stupid confession.  I hate how characters just go on and on and never get to the point. I hate how when something is revealed (even if it is unimportant) it just brings up more questions. I hate how this show is boring and uninteresting. I hate Garfeil. I hate the pacing of this show. I hate how the episodes are 30 minutes long but the extra time isn&#039;t used for anything meaningful. I hate how Fortuna says so &#039;sugoku&#039; and holds it for just long enough to annoy me (I know it is a petty complaint). But the worse thing about this season is I hate how it wastes my time.<br />
<br />
If anything this show has opened my eyes to how much I hate Tappei Nagatsuki&#039;s writing style. One of the worst things about re:zero season 2 (both parts) is the dialogue and how it never gets to the point. The characters just go on and on in a way that is mind-numbing. The first season didn&#039;t have this issue as it blasted through 9 volume of the light novel. This allowed it to cut out the badly written dialogue and keeps the interesting ideas. But this season only covers 3 volumes of the light novel. Leaving the pacing much slower and the horrible dialogue in place. If anything I don&#039;t like it because it is a faithful adaptation.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Re:zero is so boring and slow.<br />

    Everybody loves Re:Zero. At the time of writing this, the first season sits at #21 on MAL’s popularity chart. The first half of the second season is ranked within the top 100 anime of all time by user ratings. And season 2 part 2 is currently sitting at #40 in those same ratings. So I guess it’s up to me to be the lone dissenting voice in the crowd: while I liked the original show, I do not like this sequel.<br />
<br />
Part 2 of season 2 has done nothing to fix the problems I had with part 1. First of all, we’re now 17 episodes in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375913">
        and we’re STILL in the Sanctuary arc. This one arc is shaping up to rival the length of the entire first season. If you’re invested in this story, great. But if (like me) you’re not feeling it, then oh boy… strap in, because you get nothing but this one arc. It absolutely baffles me how they managed to take everything set up in the first season and deliver on none of it. Remember the Royal Selection candidates that we spent several arcs establishing characterization and relationships with at the end of the first season? Gone. Instead, we’re introduced to a whole new cast of characters that take center stage and all of them are shallower than the ones we already know. Nobuhiko Okamoto (Bakugou, My Hero Academia) lends his voice to the character of Garfiel, and he sounds the same as he does in every other character he’s ever voiced. Apparently, constant obnoxious shouting is a character trait to these writers. Rounding out the new cast are Ryuuzu Birma (voiced by Aimi Tanaka of Umaru-chan) who exists solely as an exposition dump, and the Seven Deadly Sins witches, who exist to make me wish I was watching Fullmetal Alchemist.<br />
<br />
The dialogue in this show is atrocious. Characters repeat themselves endlessly and say nothing of importance, or speak in vagaries to make the show seem deeper than it is. These conversations do not feel like conversations real people would ever have, which is a major problem because dialogue is almost all this show has. In a good dialogue-driven show like the Monogatari series, we’re treated to stunning and varied visuals to keep our eyes occupied while the conversations happen. In Re:Zero season 2, we get exactly ONE location: the middle of the woods. When part 2 aired, I was begging for this show to take me somewhere—ANYWHERE—else. As of episode 4, we are still in the middle of the woods. Boring.<br />
<br />
A good show has stakes, and in a good show you can feel them at all times. At the beginning of season 2 part 1, we’re shown Rem in a coma having been consumed by Gluttony and having all memory of her erased, and the writing sets it up to seem like our mission this season is to save Rem. Those are the stakes. But we’ve become so deeply embroiled in this Sanctuary “side quest” that none of the actions any of the characters are taking seem directly related to our main goal: saving Rem. Instead, we went to the mansion to talk to Betty, who sent us to talk to Roswaal, and on the way got caught up in saving the half-human populace of this Sanctuary. The problem is: I don’t care about any of these people as much as I care about Rem. We barely even get to see the people we’re supposedly saving. There’s one shot of some half-humans living in shambles at the beginning of the last cour, and we only get one or two scenes with the human villagers who are captive there. Technically we do already know the villagers (they’re the ones Subaru did radio calisthenics with in season 1), but we hardly know any of them as individual characters. So, why should we care about saving them? And how exactly are we moving the overarching plot forward? I know the answer has to do with Roswaal’s plan, but it’s so muddled underneath layers of plot that we feel no closer to saving Rem than we did at the start of season 2. I guess Roswaal’s motivations have more to do with forcing Subaru into an impossible situation where he can&#039;t save everybody, but the upshot of that is that it feels like all our main goals have ground to a halt so that we can run around in the woods for 17 episodes.<br />
<br />
There’s a lot more I could say, but I have to keep this review short enough that people will actually read it. Overall, Re:Zero season 2 part 2 has done nothing so far to tie up the loose ends presented by part 1, and hasn’t addressed any of my major issues with season 2 as a whole. Here’s to hoping White Fox can turn things around and give us the satisfying season we should have gotten from the start.

    At the apex of the isekai genre, one series stands head and shoulders above them all. Season 2 Part 2 of Re:Zero kara hajimaru isekai seikatsu, shows the world exactly why it’s one of the best selling LN series.<br />
<br />
If you liked Re:Zero s1 in any capacity. From its unique take on the isekai genre, world-building, characters, mystery, etc., you will love season 2 and find it an upgrade in every possible way. Re:Zero’s first season, which covered arcs 1-3, was only a teaser into the masterclass in writing that is arcs 4-6. Re:Zero has been my favourite LN series for years and I couldn’t be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386307">
        more pleased with how White Fox handled this season. Every episode had masterful direction and finale quality.<br />
<br />
Re:Zero’s biggest appeal lies in the struggles and triumphs of Subaru, it’s MC. Over the course of the first 3 arcs, we saw him fight and die over and over again all in an effort to protect those he cares about. In the latest season, Subaru’s growth is exponential. The literal and figurative trials he goes through force him to grow as an person, but also to let go of the past that still lingers with him. This is arguably the most important arc for Subaru’s character development in the entire series to date. Never before has he had to face such insurmountable odds. With his back up against the wall and seemingly no one to help him, Subaru defies fate and creates a happy future for everyone.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned earlier, White Fox have really shown how much Re:Zero means to them over the past few months. Most episodes have omitted the OP and ED in favour of a longer runtime and more storytelling. I think the way they were able to make this seamless transition between episodes due to the lack of an OP in most episodes was beautiful. Although some people complained about it, you can always download the OP and listen or watch on Youtube. If I had to nitpick anything, the animation and art did suffer a few times, particularly in the beginning of the second cour. There were some really funny looking still shots and some choppy animation. Overall, though, the show looks great and features a great OST.<br />
<br />
I can not thank White Fox enough for the way they beautifully crafted this season of Re:Zero. Yes, there will always be imperfections when compared to the books, but for the most part I have no complaints with how this season was done. With Re:Zero and Mushoku Tensei getting great adaptations this year, the future of isekai is in great hands. Re:Zero S2 P2 gets 10 Dona tea cups out of 10.

    So far this continuation of Re:Zero keeps delivering, just business as usual. No OP or ED so far either, with almost 30 min long episodes. More content and love to the people!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s story is well thought out and at every corner there&#039;s a new mystery that drags you in. One thing that I really like is that it&#039;s hard to predict what&#039;s gonna happen, there are so many twists and turns in Re:Zero.<br />
<br />
Just as previous seasons, the art is on point and is in my opinion some of the best we have ever seen. Everything from the world itself to the characters and everything in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375933">
        between.<br />
<br />
VAs are extremely talented and passionate, this is really one of the most impressive parts of the anime.<br />
<br />
I enjoy every second of each episode, there&#039;s always something going on that keeps you on edge, jumping from sheer joy or just crying.

    So after a very great part one of season two. How is part 2 of this season fairing compared to the previous part and Re:Zero as a whole? Let me tell you!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
It&#039;s doing so amazing. Continuing where we left off from last time in the previous part, with Subaru at putting his plan into action right away, with a few other stories being told through about other characters that just make it touching, sweet, awesome, and all of the above, which is great to see, and continuing onward with so many bangs and turns. It&#039;s unreal, and it&#039;s been met with great success so far.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375909">
        I&#039;m loving it, you&#039;ll love it, we&#039;ll all love it. Just what you would expect from Re:Zero, and carrying on this deep, interesting, and amazing story.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
This is a strong highlight for me so far, of why this second part is kicking so much butt. The character development is so strong, so good, you&#039;ll love it just from that along. You&#039;ll find yourself having a new appreciation for characters you may not have had before with how they&#039;ve shown themselves in these first few episodes, while digging in deep further with other main stay characters in the same regard. I&#039;d swear to really emphasize just how good it is, because it is so well done in these first few episodes, and long may it continue! <br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
Once again, Re:Zero&#039;s style on both the art and sound hasn&#039;t changed, it&#039;s still it&#039;s dark and fitting kind. All while still being that beautiful when it comes to more colourful bits. No ill marks here when it comes to Re:Zero&#039;s art and sound. My only complaint, which isn&#039;t really a complaint, as Re:Zero is known for not having the OP and even the Ending song in eps, but this parts2 OP song is awesome too, same goes for any other music within the show, and deserves a mention. Lovely stuff.<br />
<br />
Re:Zero Season 2 part 2 kicks off with a right bang, right where it left off in the previous part of the second season, leaving nothing but so much impactful drama and emotion, it truly is lovely stuff and something to see and to behold for sure, so what are you waiting for! Give it a watch now! It&#039;s going to be one of the stand outs of the season, and for great great great reasons.

    Nobody I know understands the story now. The sanctuary arc has taken so long and has so much exposition that there is no room for enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Story is supposed to be the strong point of this anime series but if no one can follow it then all thats left is mediocre animation, and bad action. The story is confusing, the main plot of saving Rem has taken a back seat to characters that are annoying and I don&#039;t care about. Even the relationship between Subaru and Emilia has taken a weird turn into unhealthy obsession which I find creepy.<br />
<br />
I felt that this stagnation started in part

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378137">
        1 of season 2, and it has thoroughly ruined my enjoyment of a show that I thought was great and refreshing in the first season.

    Re:zero will be a zero no matter how it resume.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t liked the first season, because of one thing and that is Subaru.<br />
<br />
Subaru for me is one of the few characters that I hated so much. That it ruined the story and killed the enjoment of the show completely by now.<br />
<br />
Although I think the story could have been unique and interesting. I can&#039;t stand it how Subaru treat Emilia and getting away with it. I got tired from all the stupid conversations and pointless arguments. <br />
<br />
Anyway, this show is somewhere around fine with grace. Average cast with average animation.. There is nothing really more worth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375881">
        to mention.<br />
<br />
Enjoy this season if you can, I guess.<br />
<br />
(Dropped it after ep4, but may I have a word.) Thank you!

    The Re:Zero anime inspires an incredible amount of zealousness in its fans, but otherwise lacks remarkable qualities. It has its entertaining moments, decent shots for art, and a reasonably solid sound track. The plot is convoluted and can drag quite a bit, but if you manage to follow it, has substance. The characters, however, are a weak point for me. The show&#039;s protagonist seems to have an inescapable gravitational pull which ultimately pulls every character and plot point in until he is the focus of everyone&#039;s world. I imagine this isn&#039;t a problem for those who are big fans of Subaru or are self-inserting as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377626">
        they watch the show; but Subaru is not always likable. He is... not the brightest guy.  Additionally, he often says and does thing which put him quite far on the socially inept end of that spectrum (using &quot;-tan&quot; honorific with the girl he likes and who may be a future ruler for example). In any case, you may struggle to enjoy the show if you don&#039;t find yourself liking Subaru as a character--particularly because any characters you DO like from the show will almost certainly give him an unnatural amount of attention one way or another. <br />
<br />
Season 2 part 2 seems to be making strides in some regards while regressing in others. We&#039;ve seen the least amount of focus on Subaru ever in recent episodes with Emilia receiving her bit of backstory (though he does always come up in her conversations with Echidna). Subaru hasn&#039;t done anything nearly as cringe-worthy as some of the low-points in season one. The plot still seems to consist of holes and gaps for those who watching the anime without reading LNs. I think I have been paying attention, but honestly don&#039;t understand what the &quot;trials&quot; are even about. It seems like you pass if you can look at your past without getting too sad? It feels like a convenient device for shoving in backstories for whichever characters. <br />
<br />
The biggest issue continues to be the characters. Even if you like Subaru, the focus put on him leaves all the other characters feeling like they were constructed around him. Erase him from existence and many of the remaining characters would be left void of meaningful development or characteristic. The argument of REM vs EMILIA would be like WATCHING GRASS GROW vs WATCHING PAINT DRY. Even in recent episodes, the &quot;growth&quot; Emilia experiences is almost entirely attributed to Subaru&#039;s &quot;supporting&quot; of her and seems to manifest as her emulating Subaru. Which seems weak. We also see in her flashback episode, which should have been a prime chance for additional development, a large chunk of the episode dedicated to just &quot;smol Emilia&quot; being cute. Because that seems to be all she is as a character without Subaru: cute. <br />
<br />
Re:Zero is far from the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen. It has some hype moments and it can be fun to sit and work through each episode to piece together the rather complicated plot. I think the characters are weak, but there are plenty of shows I think are carried by plot and that I enjoy. It is really wild, though, the fanaticism with which people seem to slap 10s on this show and slam critics. I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve seen anything quite like it in anime and it made me want to write my first review and maybe my last.<br />
<br />
In summary: it&#039;s mid.<br />
<br />

    JUST WATCH THIS ANIME! <br />
I don&#039;t think I need to write an essay to tell you that Studio White Fox is absolutely giving Re:zero the justice it deserves by continuing its great momentum left by season 1 and 2, this season is no different. The characters, the sound design, the animation, everything about it so far has been spectacular and I doubt that will change moving forward. <br />
And yes, although, this season, like the previous, does have a lot of dialogue and character building, which to your typical Isekai fan is blasphemous, I would beg to differ. I truly believe that last season and this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376355">
        one fixes the problem people had with the first, which was Subaru&#039;s character. The character building we get addresses these issues as well as explores the main issues of the isekai genre, the main protagonist. Yes it is unfortunate that Subaru didn&#039;t get sent to the world with a smartphone, or got hit by &quot;truck-kun&quot;, or is a genius demon reincarnated lvl 100 hero, he is just a normal human being. And the show portrays and humanises him to a degree that we can relate - not as a hikikomori edge-lord - but as someone who experiences realistic problems. I cannot tell you the amount of emotional terrorism this show has done to me, and the amount of nail-biting cliff-hangers leave me wishing a week would past by quickly so I can get more.<br />
Oh crap, I wrote an essay basically, so to wrap it up WATCH THE DAMN SHOW, stop watching bloody interspecies reviewers. Re:zero is currently my favourite show right now, and I can not wait for ep 5!

SPOILERS BELOW <br />

<br />
Story:-<br />
<br />
With how much of a suffering cour 1 had, cour 2 instead has the feeling of accomplishment and joy. It is like fighting a Dark Souls boss. You die countless times in doing so. You feel sad, disappointed and frustrated. You may even feel like giving up. But the moment you defeat that boss, you get an intense feeling of joy and happiness. You get rewarded for your relentless dedication. This is how you may feel when you watch this anime. With how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386313">
        much suffering Subaru had in cour 1, it is time for Otto to talk some sense into Subaru. Now with Subaru getting back his motivation, he confronts Roswaal and is ready to fix the problems in both the mansion and the sanctuary. <br />
There are also some mysteries that are revealed in this cour. With Emilia being one of the most mysterious character in this series, we finally get to see her backstory. And it has that mix feeling of happiness and sorrow. I really cried watching it so brace yourselves for it. It really gives Emilia a lot of character depth and makes her one of my favorites. We also see some insight into Roswaal&#039;s and Betty&#039;s backstory. It really gives them a lot of character development too. Also, one of the most enjoyable characters from season 1 is back in this cour. I wouldn&#039;t spoil their name. Although, the character is now a little different. Story:- 10/10<br />
<br />
Art:-<br />
<br />
The art is not too appealing compared to season 1 or the OVAs. But some scenes are nicely done. Art:- 7/10<br />
<br />
Sound:-<br />
<br />
There are some new OSTs that are beautiful, especially &quot;Door&quot; which was played in second episode. Ram&#039;s &quot;insert song&quot; was also great! Overall, the other songs are also decent. Sound:- 9/10<br />
<br />
Character:-<br />
<br />
This cour really shows a lot of character development especially for Emilia, Subaru, Betty, Roswaal, Ram, Otto and Garfiel. We see how insecure Emilia is when Puck leaves her and considering Emilia&#039;s past of being isolated and shunned, she actually breaks down because the only person who loved her is gone. With Emilia being at her lowest point and not being able to complete the trials, we have the &quot;reason to believe&quot; episode. Just like a phoenix, &quot;the witch of frost&quot; (Emilia) rises up again and confronts the &quot;witch of greed&quot; (Echidna), now with confidence that is unshakable. That was a really badass scene. <br />
Otto&#039;s backstory was really well done and provided a lot of depth to his character. Garfiel&#039;s trial was really emotional and I loved it. His relationship with his mom really brought me to tears. Apart from these three, Subaru and Ram also had their moments to shine. Furthermore, Betty and Roswaal&#039;s past was also beautifully done. The relationship between Emilia and Subaru has also developed a lot especially after &quot;reason to believe&quot;. Btw I especially loved smol Emilia and the cute Emilia x Subaru dance. Adding to that, the Ram, Puck and Roswaal scene was really badass and awesome. Also, Subaru and Betty scenes were really good! I wouldn&#039;t want to spoil it though ;) <br />
Character:- 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:-<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed each and every episode. It is filled with sorrow, despair but at the end of it all, it has that rare feeling of accomplishment and joy which makes this anime really enjoyable. <br />
Enjoyment:- 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall:-<br />
<br />
Just finish part 2. It is gonna be amazing, I promise. EMT!<br />
Overall rating:- 10/10

    As someone who knows that the author really loves putting plot twists here. I really enjoyed unexpected turns that occured. 30 mins without OP and ED is like a bliss. Enjoyed the content more. The character development develops in a quite realistic way. Also, The feels hit me quite hard especially on the flashbacks. <br />
<br />
The story is absolutely amazing, far from any generic isekai title.<br />
The animation is arguably one of the best animation in its own way (Not as good as Violet everdarden).<br />
The music they use perfectly fits to the theme and know when to actually use them (No overused, or even boring ost).<br />
Character wise,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377448">
        The main character is probably hated by some people because the way he acts which is the intention of the writter<br />
I really enjoyed  every episode of it.

    (Read my conclusion below at the end after the first parts about the anime since I&#039;ve finished it and had to complement it.)<br />
<br />
The second part of the second seasons seems to be the conclusion of all the mysteries which unfolded upon us in the first part.<br />
<br />
Conclusions are always an eye opener which can take a little magic away from all that&#039;s happening every time something&#039;s revealed to the audience. But I&#039;m pretty glad that the magic&#039;s still strong since some reveals are bringing up some new plots with them to bring fresh air into the show while moving the story forward.<br />
<br />
Up to this point there&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375967">
        a pretty fast pace going on, trying to explain everything what&#039;s happening right now while trying not to feel too rushed. Some people might say it became a bit cheesy at some parts, since the emotional and irrational train is pretty strong on those first episodes. To be honest I wasn&#039;t as much invested in those as in the scene from season 1 where Rem genuinely put her heart out to rescue someone in true despair what is truly a scene which should be engraved in stone for the next generations. But nonetheless I enjoyed it since I&#039;m a sucker for emotional and nerve wrecking moments, that doesn&#039;t mean that everyone can handle that amount since it kinda felt a little bit overdone this time.<br />
<br />
The first part differs in one point to the second part. While in part 1 the protagonist was once more faced with a ton of trials, despair and cluelessness, the second part will contain the brighter side, means bringing hope, answers and a conclusion to the arc. This formula was already well used in the first season, meaning that there&#039;s nothing wrong with it. It just got a little bit more predictable.<br />
<br />
There are some details which came out of nowhere, especially the scene which &quot;packed a punch&quot; (to be a bit cryptic so that it&#039;s hopefully understandable for those who have seen to this part), but I&#039;m quiet positive that the show will deliver an explanation on this one in the near future.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Re:Zero - Second Season (Part 2) will bring you a piece of the first parts mind, answering a lot of questions while bringing new plots to the table for hopefully more seasons to come.<br />
<br />
PS: I&#039;ve finished the anime, at some few points it really got a bit out of hand, but in the end this chapter seemed like a conclusion to a dramatic theater piece that pushed the limits of those who can&#039;t handle this overload on emotions and love. At the end it&#039;s still an anime with some minor tropes and some cliches, but sustained an awesome job how it explains some deeper and complex subjects as general emotions and how you should embrace it without beeing too superficial. As a friend of mine already said, he can&#039;t handle it due to the realistic approach dealing with a mix of realistic matters and excessive situations therefore he don&#039;t want to watch anime to have to deal with reality what is very often the reason why some people nowadays tend to dislike the series. But at this point I have to point out that therefore the one watching the anime is to blame for picking something which is not their taste or their lack of having no foresight instead of blaming the series that it lacks everything this show never intended to be. I agree that this season went a little bit over the top in some matters, but the premise from the beginning as to how it is handled stays the same, which is why the overall reviews maintain a high and strong rating while some bad reviews were likely pushed and raided from haters of said type of series.<br />
<br />
In conclusion:<br />
So for the reader who read my review so far. Don&#039;t get too irritated because of those other low reviews, if you&#039;ve seen the other two prequels without worries then you&#039;ll surely like this one, too!

    This is a review for the entirety of Re:Zero 2nd Season. Spoilers for it ahead.<br />
<br />
The first season of Re:Zero was surprisingly… good. It started as another run-of-mill isekai with an insufferable main character and edgy time-loop gimmick, but, through some exceptional writing, it was able take these elements and actually turn them into an engaging and inspirational narrative. Subaru starts the series as an incredibly dislikable main character. He obsesses over Emilia, a girl he just met, and treats her like an object rather than a person: like a waifu. He refers to her in inappropriate honorifics, white knights for her, treats like a child,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386459">
        and never once stops to consider how his actions might make her feel. During the first half of season one, Subaru is a completely socially-inept otaku and excruciatingly painful to watch. I assumed that this was simply an author’s poor attempt at creating a self-insert character for what he thought a majority of his audience was. I really wanted to drop Re:Zero at this point, but it was massively popular and garnering a ton of attention from the community, so I reluctantly decided to keep watching it. I’m so, so glad that I did.<br />
<br />
Episode 18 of season one, the “Rem” episode, is absolutely fantastic and, in my opinion, one of the best episodes in anime as a whole. In a single episode, in a single scene, the “purpose” of Re:Zero is made clear. Re:Zero is about Subaru—and he’s not a good person… but he can get better. This episode addresses all the flaws in Subaru’s character and promises to fix them. The rest of the season shows Subaru acknowledging his shortcomings, learning from them, and becoming a better person because of it. The reason I hated Re:Zero was because I made an assumption that everything was meaningless; I was positive that Re:Zero was just another run-of-mill isekai with an insufferable main character and edgy time-loop gimmick. I was wrong. The second half of season one recontextualized the first, and, looking back, I can say the entire season was, surprisingly, pretty great.<br />
<br />
Funny thing about me being a skeptic though—I was still one.<br />
<br />
I didn’t care about the fantasy world or most of the side characters. I liked Re:Zero for its core narrative, Subaru’s character arc, but there were a lot of mediocre things that diluted it. That character arc, for the most part, finishes at the end of the first season. Subaru is shown to have grown significantly as a person, and Emilia, his end goal, finally acknowledges him as someone she might not be in love with now, but can see herself falling for if he stays on his current path. It’s a sweet ending that I felt like was almost overly conclusive because the fantasy side of the story seemed to still have a significant amount left. I felt like the story could only go one of two ways: completely dive into the fantasy side of things and let its main character stay stagnant for the rest of the series, or ruin Subaru’s character by making him regress from where it stood at the end of season one. For the five years in between season one and two, I hated the thought of an incomplete series that I liked getting a sequel: positive that one would simply tarnish what I already enjoyed.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, I didn’t trust an author that had only proven to shatter my expectations and skepticism before to do it again, and, once again, I was wrong. The second season of Re:Zero is not only a meaningful continuation of its core narrative, Subaru’s growth as a character, but also exceeds its predecessor in how well that core narrative is told.<br />
<br />
I thought Subaru’s character arc ended with the first season, and, well, so did Subaru. There is a flaw with Subaru that is completely overlooked by him, and, because the narrative is told from his perspective, glossed over by the viewer as well. It’s a flaw that comes spilling out of Subaru in episode 18 of season one—Subaru doesn’t love himself. He changes who he is, addressing all small, minor flaws of his only to ignore the major flaw addressing them has now created. Subaru is unhappy. He sees no value in himself, and, because of this, can’t see why other people put value in him. This is what Subaru’s actual character arc will be for the rest of Re:Zero. The character arc that I praised so heavily in season one is merely a prologue to the rest of the series. It addresses several small issues with Subaru’s character while creating an enormous one that will be the throughline for the rest of its long-running narrative.<br />
<br />
In the first half of season two, different characters continuously put value in Subaru despite him never fully understanding why. During the first part of Subaru’s trial, he is forced to confront his past. Before Subaru came to the fantasy world, he was a high school student that had no friends and constantly skipped class to stay in his room depressed. Subaru hates himself and sees himself as failure. Despite this, he still has parents that show him immense love and support, never once fighting with him. Subaru doesn’t see how his parents couldn’t be disappointed in a son like him, but they truly still believe Subaru will eventually figure out his way in life and find happiness. They put value in their son, because their son is worth putting value into, even if Subaru can’t see why. Subaru talks with each of his parents individually, and by the end of their conversations finally comes to accept the love they’ve always given him.<br />
<br />
The second trial is Subaru confronting the present—or at least a version of it. He is shown what happens after kills himself. Subaru has never stopped to think about the consequences of forcing himself to return by death through suicide. Even though these realities might not be real, Subaru doesn’t realize that each time he dies there are tons of people that will mourn for him. Subaru has never put value in himself, so he doesn’t realize the severity of how painful it is for his friends, real versions of them or not, to lose him. The second trial shows how much Subaru is worth to others and makes him contemplate these extreme actions more going forward.<br />
<br />
In the middle of season two part one, Otto, a side character up to this point, becomes much more important. He saves Subaru from being held captive, which is extremely bad for him in particular because he is unable to use his last resort escape option, return by death. Although Subaru has spent a significant amount of time traveling with him, he has never given his relationship with Otto much thought. After all the time they have spent together, Otto now starts to see Subaru as a friend, but the viewer has only seen Otto as a meaningless side character up to this point because the story is told from Subaru’s perspective, and he doesn’t understand why someone would consider him a friend; Subaru doesn’t understand why Otto has decided to put value in him. Their relationship is handled beautifully, and after Subaru realizes that Otto is, indeed, his friend Otto starts becoming important to the story. The last scene of season two part one is even dedicated to Otto helping Subaru out of a bad mental state, showing how important Otto is in the narrative of Re:Zero as whole now.<br />
<br />
That bad mental state being caused by the witches’ tea party. The witches’ tea party is possibly the most important scene in all of Re:Zero. After 38 episodes, the “purpose” of the story is finally made clear and put into words by the author, “love yourself”. Subaru growth is all tied back to this one idea. It is not enough for Subaru to simply change who is, he needs to learn to value himself. The witches’ tea party forces Subaru to finally confront this issue. Subaru thought the pivotal scene in the narrative was the conversation he had with Rem in episode 18—so did I at the time… because of course I did, the story is being told from Subaru’s perspective after all. The “Rem” scene lays the foundation of the prologue; the witches’ tea party lays the foundation of the entire narrative. Unlike what happened with his conversation with Rem, Subaru doesn’t leave the witches’ tea party able to change himself, but he is finally given the knowledge of how to do so. This scene is easily the best one in Re:Zero’s second season, and it stands next to the one with Rem as one of the best scenes in all of anime.<br />
<br />
Whereas season two part one explores Subaru’s character, season two part two explores the fantasy world and the side characters. Honestly, it is a lot weaker because of this. I don’t think the second core of the second season is bad (and exploring the world and side characters are still important and what a lot of viewers want), but I feel that Re:Zero is at its strongest when Subaru is the focus. Every exceptional part of the story so far has stemmed from Subaru being an exceptionally well-written character. I think it’s here where I’ll start explaining my problems with Re:Zero: the things that dilute its core narrative.<br />
<br />
Just as much as Re:Zero is about Subaru, it is about the fantasy world he now lives in. I much prefer when the focus is on Subaru rather than the world, but, excluding bias, I don’t even think a lot of the fantasy elements are handled very well. The exploration of the world is painfully slow. It’s understandable for such a long story to take its time building its world, especially in fantasy, but when there is such an overwhelming amount to go through, it shouldn’t be taking this long to get anywhere. The sanctuary is great and really important to the growth of some characters, including Subaru, but we didn’t need to spend an entire season here. The pacing of the show can just become agonizing sometimes.<br />
<br />
Something that really does not help the pacing is the average episode length. We get full, 30 minute episodes with cut openings and endings (making the longer episodes feel closer to 33-ish minutes), but we still make barely any progress with each one. A lot of these episodes aren’t even majorly important to the overarching narrative either; I understand making the episodes involving things like Subaru’s backstory and the witches’ tea party a bit longer, but several minor episodes have a 29:29 runtime (without openings and endings) when they could have been condensed into normal, 25-ish minute episodes, probably still being able to have at least the opening play. The opening plays twice in second core, the first time not occurring until six episodes in, and it simply just did not need to be this way.<br />
<br />
The other big problem I have with Re:Zero is the side characters. Most (but not all) of them contribute very little to the story despite having tremendous focus. Some of the more notable examples being: Garfiel, Beatrice, Petelgeuse, and Ram. These characters have a place in the story and are all written fine, but there is so much wasted time put into them. They add nothing to the core narrative, Subaru’s character growth, and just needless drag on the series. There was so much time spent on Garfiel and Beatrice specifically in the second season and this massively weighed it down.<br />
<br />
I will say, this is not the case for all of the side characters. I’ve already talked about why Otto is such a good character, and Roswaal and Echidna are also very well done. Roswaal is a great representation of what Subaru can become if succumbs to madness, and Echidna is a much needed antagonistic force that also serves as a way to explain how the world functions.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things about Re:Zero that I enjoy, but there are so many of these small grievances I have with the show. I know a lot of it stems from what I look for in stories; I strongly prioritize thematic depth over things like lure, scenario, and world building. Even with that bias, I still feel like Re:Zero is so much better as a character piece rather than a fantasy, and I wish Re:Zero would do a better job at staying in the lane in which it excels.<br />
<br />
If I haven’t made it clear enough already, Subaru is an outstanding character—but he’s not a finished one. At the end of season two, Subaru is far from the character we’ll eventually see. I don’t know how it’ll get there, but the ending of the series will have Subaru finally come to love himself and learn why others do as well. If Re:Zero stays thematically consistent, the person Subaru will end up with is clear. It’s not Emilia; it’s Rem.<br />
<br />
There are so, so many things that happen in the second season that point to Subaru choosing Rem in the end. Most importantly, let’s look at what Rem represents thematically; She loves Subaru unconditionally, flaws and all. The reason Subaru turned down Rem in episode 18 of season one is because he doesn’t understand how Rem can love him—so he chooses Emilia. Emilia’s character was yet to be explored, but, if Subaru chose her, it was a sign of dissatisfaction with his current self. It forced Subaru to become a better person. If Subaru were to choose Rem, it would have been him admitting defeat and accepting a version of himself that he hated. Thematically, Subaru was forced to choose Emilia. I thought that choice was the point of his character, but it’s only Subaru opening the door to what his real issue is; Subaru’s character arc isn’t just simply becoming a better person, it’s finding a way to love himself. Choosing Rem initially is a complete failure; choosing Emilia is taking the first step; choosing to return to Rem only after first choosing Emilia is where that path, the one to self love, leads.<br />
<br />
Subaru’s new character arc beginning at the witches’ tea party shines a new light on episode 18. Emilia used to be the correct answer, but now it’s Rem. It’s made even clearer that this is the direction the narrative is heading in episode 15 of season two. Yes, the scene where Subaru and Emilia kiss heavily implies that Subaru will eventually end up choosing Rem. In this scene, we finally see that Emilia’s character is parallel to Subaru’s. They have the same problem. They both think they’re unworthy of people&#039;s love and can&#039;t see why others love them. This scene has Emilia come to the same realization that Subaru did at the witches’ tea party; she never understood that there are people that truly do love and value her tremendously. Subaru loves Emilia, but is unable to draw an obvious parallel between her situation and his own.<br />
<br />
During this scene, a comment Subaru’s mom told him during his first trial plays in his head. “What matters isn’t how you start or what happens in the middle. It’s how it ends.” Subaru starts out loving Emilia and continues to love her for a while, but, in the end, he’ll love Rem. It’ll only be clear to Subaru when he finishes his character arc, when he learns to love himself, that he’s actually in love with Rem: the person who has shown him unconditional love even in his most problematic, defeated, and depressed state.<br />
<br />
Other, less significant, things that point to Subaru choosing Rem:<br />
• Rem’s biggest issue at the end of season one is that she is a crutch that hinders Subaru’s character growth, but removing her from the narrative lets Subaru continue to grow.<br />
• Emilia loves Subaru, the person who helps her out of her worst state of mind. If Emilia’s and Subaru’s characters are parallels, that would mean Subaru would love Rem, the person who helps him out of his worst state of mind.<br />
• When Subaru gives reasons to why he loves Emilia, it’s always superficial things such as looks. Subaru doesn’t seem to love Emilia; he lusts for her. When the Witch of Lust first shows up, it’s in Rem’s form despite him constantly saying he desires Emilia.<br />
<br />
I’m still skeptical of Re:Zero going down this path. It feels like I might be asking too much of the narrative for Subaru to choose Rem despite already having turned her down. My interpretation of Re:Zero’s themes is solely based on what&#039;s happened in the anime so far, and it seems the story still has a very long ways to go. Plenty of things could change, but I need to stop being skeptical of a story that has proven to blow my expectations out of the water multiple times already. Subaru will end up with Rem. Why? Because Re:Zero is damn good.

    Im really enjoying this anime, the last episode was amzing, never did I ever think I would like bettleguess before watching these last episodes, but one complaint I have is they havnt shown the intro yet and that was a disappointment, subaru has gotten very little screen time letting everyone else get some good character development, I love this show and cant wait for new episodes.<br />
<br />
I love the current ark where emilia has to face her past subaru has been extremely helpful to Emilia and he also hasn&#039;t died yet, dont want to jinx anything but if he dies now he will meticulously have to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377747">
        go through all of that again which i would be very upset if he did.<br />
<br />
overall I would give this season a 10/10 because of how good the charecter development is, I loved emilias backstory, garfiels backstory, and ottos backstory.<br />

    Just wanted to write this to say that Re:Zero is goated, that Subaru is the goat MC and he deserves more respect. The story heavily relies on the fact that you like the characters or are at least are interested in them imo. Which after reading some stuff, people clearly don&#039;t or are salty about the fact that Subaru didn&#039;t choose their &quot;Waifu&quot;. So they proceed to hate on Subaru and Emilia and wonder why they don&#039;t like the show.  I really wonder if people are watching the same show as me? Or maybe they watch with their eyes closed idk. Funny how they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382178">
        be writing a whole ass essay on how they hate the show though over some petty stuff too or they&#039;re just impatient to get answers from a 11 arc story that is on it&#039;s 4th arc rn....

    I feel like I can see a big parallel between Re: Zero and Attack on Titan. When Aot first aired, its first season had many hype moments and was very action-packed, it moved at a fast pace. Additionally, Re: Zero&#039;s 1st season moved quite fast, in terms of plot and hype, a lot happened in just 25 episodes. However, Aot&#039;s 2nd season, (which I personally found better than its 1st season) was much slower, but dealt with the plot and story in more depth but had less action. The 2nd season of aot received less of a reception from the anime community rather than the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379065">
        1st season since it was less &quot;hype,&quot; however I think it was better due to the amazing worldbuilding it had. Similarly, Re: Zero&#039;s 2nd season is a lot slower compared to the 1st season, but its worldbuilding is absolutely phenomenal. I can understand why some people just want to leave the sanctuary arc, it&#039;s the longest arc in the whole series, however this section has really built up the character&#039;s foundations really well and we can understand their motives and behaviors a lot more. <br />
<br />
If you think about it, especially from light novel/web novel reader points of view, the set up for Re: Zero and Attack on Titan is very similar. 1st season is very hype, 2nd season much slower, picks up back in season 3 and then the best bit is in season 4. Arc 6 (season 4) is considered peak re: zero and season 3 (arc 5) has a lot more action and is very fast-paced.
