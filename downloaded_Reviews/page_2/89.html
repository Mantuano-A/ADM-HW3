The fifth installment of the Kara no Kyoukai series, Mujun Rasen (Paradox Spiral), is somewhat of a departure from the previous four outings not just in terms of its running time (almost two hours), but also in terms of art direction and story.<br />
<br />
Set around two months after Fukan Fuukei, the tale begins with a disjointed sequence of events that are gradually cleared up as the movie continues. The story itself centres around a boy named Enjou Tomoe, who is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12181">
        saved from a group of thugs by Ryougi Shiki. She invites him to stay with her after he begs her to hide him somewhere as he believes that he has committed a crime and appears to be on the run.<br />
<br />
During this time it seems that Kokuto Mikiya is away on some business, and Aozaki Touko is investigating an odd rumour she has heard from a policeman she knows.<br />
<br />
Now the main problem with the story direction is that many people will be confused by the path it takes. There are numerous sequences that are repeated several times, and the story has a tendency to not only jump about from one time to another, but also from one event to another (a style similar to that used by Luc Besson at times). The result is something more along the lines of a Satoshi Kon production, and while there will be many people who enjoy the numerous twists, turns, loops and whorls that take place in the story, there will be just as many who will be put off by the overwhelming amount of information one has to process at times.<br />
<br />
The art and animation throughout the series thus far has been top notch, however there is a noticeable drop in quality in this Mujun Rasen. Given the length of the movie it may be that Ufotable were forced to cut some corners with the designs and animation, but there are quite a few scenes where their normal quality really shines through. The CG is, as always, of a very high standard and runs smoothly in conjunction with the normal animation. The backgrounds and backdrops are well designed, and a lot of thought has gone into ensuring that certain elements in this area follow the concept of the story.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the drop in quality I mentioned is noticeable in several scenes, and in one in particular, the character looks constipated rather than hysterical. In addition to this the animation of the action sequences, whilst being excellent overall, suffers towards the end of the movie, with one key sequence being more dizzying than breathtaking. That said, the sequence in question will appeal to those who like roller coasters at the very least.<br />
<br />
The sound is on par with the other movies and is well executed overall. The effects are extremely good throughout, but the old problem of the noise sometimes being too overwhelming has reared its head once more. The score used throughout the Mujun Rasen lends to the general atmosphere, however there are times when the music seems a little out of sync with the on-screen action.<br />
<br />
On the plus side it seems my prayers have been answered as more is revealed about Touko, especially as the antagonist in this film, Araya Souren (who appeared briefly at the very end of the previous movie declaring himself to be a magus), has a history with her. In addition to this, there is a secondary character named Cornelius Alba who also has a history with both Touko and Araya. In addition to this the viewer can finally see some different sides to Shiki, as well as gaining some insight into why Touko was so interested in her during the events of Garan no Dou.<br />
<br />
The downside is that Mikiya continues to be more of a supporting role in this movie, and Tomoe, while generally being a decent character for the most part, may annoy some people.<br />
<br />
Even with those flaws, this is still an excellent movie (especially if you can get your head around the plot). Fans of Kara no Kyoukai should generally be pleased with this latest addition to the franchise, and although it does drop a little in terms of animation and artwork, Mujun Rasen will hopefully herald a new direction for the series.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m expecting good things from the sixth movie...<br />

    *Some of the review got deleted... wtf? I&#039;ll try rewriting a little, but I can&#039;t guarantee success.<br />
<br />
OK, so this is version 3 of my KnK 5 review after watching the movie for the second time and getting part of my first review deleted. The full summary part has been taken off to keep the size down (I spent a lot of time on that too). I will be more in-depth and critical this time around. Before you read this review or watch the movie, make sure you&#039;ve watched the first 4 KnK movies. Scores are based on 2nd time around. Comments and private messages are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12046">
        appreciated to help me review better next time around.<br />
<br />
[STORY]<br />
First Time: 8.5/10<br />
The thing to note for #5 compared to the other 4 is that this time, the movie is nearly 2 hours long. That&#039;s more than double any of the previous movies. However, the story is by no means slow, and there are more than enough turn-arounds and absurd twists to keep it enjoyable. Odd installments of flashbacks and repeating scenes make the whole thing a bit difficult to follow, but overall, the story was unique compared to the other Kara no Kyoukai episodes and understandable if you&#039;ve watched the other 4. By this time, you should be quite familiar with Shiki&#039;s as well as Touko&#039;s abilities.<br />
<br />
Second Time: 9.2/10<br />
The problem with the first time around was the confusing non-linear story pattern. The montage when Shiki reappears was helpful at clearing this up, and the second time through, I could grasp some of the deeper meaning in some of the obscure statements. Araya and Touko had some really profound quotes that only truly struck me after watching the movie again (this time, I didn&#039;t have to worry about catching the plot). Philosophically, it was almost like GiTS for me. I also noticed some real logic lapses the second time around. Stuff like how the police didn&#039;t do a follow-up and the lack of blood in some scenes and excess of blood in other scenes. Some of the coming back from the dead and not being fazed by stab wounds are also ridiculous, but within the bounds of a supernatural anime like KnK.<br />
<br />
[ART/ANIMATION]<br />
First Time: 10/10<br />
I was going to give this a 9, but I suppose art also entails animation. As always, KnK has some of the best (or possibly the best) animation of all time. The fights are packed full of excitement and every attack is conveyed beautifully. Again, Shiki&#039;s eyes are as beautiful as ever, and there is plenty of blood. This time around, there is more than one fight scene, so it&#039;s almost like double the awesomeness.<br />
<br />
Second Time: 10/10<br />
KnK is basically the height of animation quality. There were a few lapses here and there and some sloppy artwork in some places, but the second time made me concentrate more on how beautiful the animation really is. Sometimes, I take KnK for granted, but compared to other anime, this is on its own level. Since there were 3 fight scenes, I am satisfied that there weren&#039;t any blatant drops in quality for any of them. Some criticisms for you picky people include lack of blood during the stabbing scene and some cgi moments that were less than superb. Also, Touko regrows her teeth in her fight and Mikiya is present in the very beginning of Touko&#039;s fight on the ground (1:07:32 in the gg-Takajun subs) when he shouldn&#039;t be (he disappears in the next set of frames). Overall excellent though.<br />
<br />
[SOUND]<br />
First Time: 9.3/10<br />
Every person has their own personal taste with music. For me, the soundtrack of every KnK movie is beautiful, and this is no exception. With mixes of familiar tracks from the previous 4 movies as well as a few of its own, KnK 5 has perhaps the best soundtrack of the entire series so far. Additionally, the ED song is Sprinter, which is my favorite Kalafina song so far. The thing that makes KnK so amazing is not only the animation quality and straight-up beauty of the fight scenes, but also the incredible bgm that backs each fight scene up. Ever since the first movie, the bgm that they play has never failed to engage me more into the story and &quot;feel&quot; the emotions.<br />
<br />
Second Time: 9.7/10<br />
I downloaded a rip of the KnK 5 OST after watching it the first time. Lo and behold, the second time around, I loved it even more. Once again, Sprinter is a definite plus. Sure, the soundtrack is a bit repetitive, especially from other KnK movies, but I think that&#039;s what makes it great. Why take down a winning formula? That being said, this is the best OST of the 5 movies in my opinion because it combines many great tracks into a full 2 hours, along with adding a few compositions of its own.<br />
<br />
[CHARACTER]<br />
First Time: 9.7/10<br />
If animation is the one thing KnK is associated with, character would be a close second. From the utterly confusing first movie to the scene-setting second movie, we&#039;ve seen Shiki, Mikiya, and Touko develop. Now that I have become comfortable with Shiki, I consider her to be one of the most interesting characters of any anime, regardless of her eyes. Her monotone conversations never cease to amuse me, and she gets in a lot of time talking with Tomoe, the new character. The psychological aspects of KnK 5 rival those of some of the previous movies, and there is some questioning on the side of the &quot;bad guys&quot; as to what &quot;absolute wisdom&quot; is. If you&#039;ve seen and understood the other movies, the character development in this is just as good, if not better because we get to see a side of Touko that has not been revealed before.<br />
<br />
Second Time: 9.4/10<br />
So I HAD reviews of individual characters, but it got eaten up by the MAL system somehow... Basically, there was some fluctuation between characters. Shiki and Touko really shone through this one, but Enjou was just annoying in some ways and Mikiya got almost no screen time. To reiterate, Shiki was just adorable at times, which is part of the reasoning behind the high score.<br />
<br />
[ENJOYMENT]<br />
First Time: 9.9/10<br />
I don&#039;t really remember what I had written here before, but basically, this is well worth the time to watch. Heck, I even watched it twice... Just absolutely fantastic fight scenes and some serious plot development to think over.<br />
<br />
Second Time: 9.2/10<br />
Watch it again if you want. The fight scenes are still top-notch and engaging. Plot elements may drag on for the second time, but it&#039;s helpful to know what&#039;s going on as it&#039;s going on.<br />
<br />
[OVERALL]<br />
9.8/10<br />
Extremely impressive movie with some serious psychological elements interweaved into a complex plot. As always with KnK, incredible animation and character development. Basically what I&#039;m trying to say is that this was one of the best things I have ever seen, anime or not, and something that I rewatched a week after seeing it the first time (don&#039;t forget that it&#039;s 2 hours long).

    The Garden Of Sinners Movie 5.<br />
<br />
After having watched the four prequels of the series and finishing the fifth just now, I will write this review based on the information we have up to now for the characters, storyline and so on. Not for what this series could be or how the adaptation should have been either.<br />
Also, this is my first actual review, so I hope I will end up being helpful to those reading this.<br />
<br />
Ok, let&#039;s begin! I&#039;ll seperate this into 5 parts.<br />
<br />
First off; The story. 9/10<br />
<br />
The 5th part of the series does not fail to deliver yet another storyline that will not confuse the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94291">
        viewer, as long as he pays attention to the dialogue, that most of the time drives the show along. <br />
 Mystery, incredible twists and gore scenes lead to this increadibly dark show. The reason behind my 9 is based on the fact that I found the mystery absolutely original, it&#039;s something I have never seen nor did I ever think of, and the way it was explained in the movie was simple and clear. As for its negative side, the only part of it that always annoyed me was the order of the series themselves. It never had a fluent continuation, a new movie was always beginning from a new checkpoint making it unclear at times.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation; 10/10<br />
<br />
The main characters are extremely well drawn. The simillarities between this movie and Fate/Zero are quite obvious, especially in the faces/eyes. Takeuchi Takashi is easily one of my favourite character designers and he has not failed to impress me yet another time. I can guarantee satisfaction on this certain aspect. <br />
 As for the animation, compared to the rest of the movies it was downgraded due to the length. However, ufotable is like pizza. Even when it is bad, it is still good. This part of the show is still its high point and when it has to get good, you know it will. The fights are excellent, wild and bloody as always, the movements are smooth and realistic and will keep the viewer glued to the screen whenever they occur.<br />
<br />
Sound; 9/10<br />
<br />
Just like the movies before it, and, from what I&#039;ve read, the movies after it, the sound is fitting always to the situation, energetic as well as calming whenever it should be, however, in this particular movie, the soundtracks tend to get very loud, making it hard to hear the voice actors or focusing on certain situations, although that really gives you an adrenalin dose when it should.<br />
<br />
Characters; 9/10<br />
<br />
The characters in this movie had their best performance yet. We have seen each one of them in action this time, as well as proof of their intelligence and the potential that they have in the development of the story. We also get introduced to the counterpart of Shiki, who is the main focus of the first half of the show. The mystery that, as mentioned above impressed me the most in this movie was revolving around him, so I really enjoyed his stay on the show.<br />
<br />
Overall/Enjoyment; 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall, this movie&#039;s advantages far outdo its flaws and the viewer will remain speechless at times. It deliveres pure entertainment. Intense plot, with truly well done fight sequences that might make your jaw drop. That&#039;s what made me make a review on this particular movie.<br />
 Do not hold back from watching. And do it as many times as you want.<br />
 <br />
I hope I helped you out and I&#039;ll try and get better with reviewing.

    Overall: 9<br />
<br />
This is a great film that I can recommend to almost any anime watcher, even those who have yet to see any of the other Kara no Kyoukai movies. Mujun Rasen (Paradox Spiral)  has a lot of &quot;popcorn&quot; action and suspense while still being fully immersed in Kara no Kyoukai&#039;s dark world. Be sure to watch it on Blu-ray quality video.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
The story is much faster paced than the first four movies, which was sorely needed. One fault of the Nasuverse (the deep and underlying mythos of Fate, Tsukihime, and KnK) is that some concepts (such as the &quot;counter-force&quot;) are hard to grasp,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168129">
        and this film is so focused on its quick pace that it leaves a somewhat ambiguous explanation of the concept. This isn&#039;t a huge detriment to the plot, and the climax of the movie does not rely upon those concepts to a fault. In fact, it is a welcome change from the &quot;infodump&quot; style of exposition favored in the first four films.<br />
<br />
Watch it till the end, enjoy the story, maybe we can talk about it later. Don&#039;t want to spoil people here.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
While not as extravagantly and thoroughly detailed as say, a studio Ghibili movie, ufotable does an amazing job of translating the film&#039;s brutal action and menacing atmosphere into a visual experience.<br />
<br />
Small visual queues such as a half empty Haagen Dazs strawberry ice cream cup (how much did these guys pay ufotable anyways???) permeate and reappear in disjointed scenes to accentuate the unsettling and discontinuous atmosphere of the whole movie.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
The music is excellent, and the huge number of small audio queues that repeat throughout the most jarring scenes of the movies only add to the shock value.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
The story of Enjou Tomoe is the backbone of the character development in this movie. Through his unreliable and disturbed mind we see the nature of evil afoot in this film. The main antagonist embodies inhumanity at its most noble form.<br />
<br />
The characters are strong, yes, but its hard to gather all of their motives accurately from this single film. Again, the way that ufotable handled which characters to flesh out the most is much better than any &quot;infodump&quot;, so it is not a detriment to the series; if nothing a reason to watch the rest of it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
The most important scenes of the film are filled with amazing cinematography and symbolism towards the story&#039;s main themes. The final half of the movie will stun you in terms of animation and plot development.<br />
<br />
Now excuse me as I watch this masterpiece again.

    Given that I haven&#039;t rated any of the other Kara no Kyoukai movies below an 8, the harsh drop here certainly disturbs the graph. Indeed, a 6 might seem incongruous—and for the acclaimed fifth movie of all things! Rather than waste everyone&#039;s time by ill-advisedly trying to compress this movie&#039;s problems into a pithy introductory hook, I&#039;ll simply quote the antagonist, Souren Araya, as he expounds upon his villainous motivations in a dying speech near the end of this movie, the second-lengthiest in the Kara no Kyoukai franchise. Read aloud in sonorous tones for full impact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans are hopeless. This is a story from long ago.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194699">
        You can&#039;t save every human, so how can you save the ones who weren&#039;t saved? There is no answer. But if I can open [the spiral of] origin and end the world—if I can record and observe all deaths until the end of the world—if I can observe the unredeemed and unsaved from the start, then the ones who died meaninglessly would obtain a meaning. I would be able to know their happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I was watching Mujun Rasen, one of the guys I was with asked if the unfortunate fellow had dementia at around this point in the dialogue. I couldn&#039;t blame him.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, this is not the best Kara no Kyoukai movie. It&#039;s not even the second-best. Actually, it&#039;s the worst. How this particular instalment of a truly great film series became widely celebrated as the best of the bunch is beyond comprehension. It preserves Kinoko Nasu&#039;s worst—underline WORST—storytelling instincts, and precious few of his finer ones. Reams of incomprehensible expository dialogue flow like cement from the flapping mouths of its characters; I shudder to imagine what was left out. This movie pulls the drag chute hard innumerable times over the course of its two hour length. Perhaps because of the cinematic medium, it was even more excruciating than is usual for Nasu—at least when Kotomine wanted to bust my balls with lore for two hours in a church at the beginning of Fate/stay night, I could click through fairly easily. <br />
<br />
Some cynics may argue that this movie&#039;s popularity is thanks to flashy, well-directed action scenes that appeal to the simple-minded. My response is that most of the ADD-addled audience that they&#039;re imagining for this movie would be instantly put off by the constant talking head interruptions that deemphasize said action, and equally by the unending flow of esoteric chuunibyou fodder, especially during the second half of the movie—when most of those great action scenes take place. The truth is that I don&#039;t understand why this movie is the most critically acclaimed of the Kara no Kyoukai series, and I&#039;m not sure I ever will.<br />
<br />
On that note, this is possibly the chuuniest thing I&#039;ve ever seen. This movie has an invisible character, and its name is Choony. This specter haunts the screenplay, possessing characters at will to use them as its mouthpiece. Choony&#039;s delight in fuelling the adolescent imagination with mind-melting Nasuverse esoterica is so great that he troubles nearly the whole cast of this movie, speaking through them at regular intervals and ruminating on such vital concepts as the Swirl of the Root and the Counterforce for five to ten minutes. Once Araya and Cornelius Alba show up, Choony goes into overdrive, barely allowing the viewer more than a few minutes between its droning interludes.<br />
<br />
Mainstays Shiki, Mikiya, and Touko, when not possessed by Choony, are as likeable as ever, and the tortured Tomoe, a new character introduced in this instalment, is a welcome enough addition to the cast. Naturally, the central mystery revolves around Tomoe, and his connection to a strange apartment building in which his impoverished family once lived. Convinced that he killed his parents in said building yet unable to decipher his own memories, he runs away from home and encounters Shiki when she saves him from some thugs in an alley. His arc is compelling if predictable. On the other hand, Araya is the least relatable antagonist in any genre film I&#039;ve ever seen. Calling him a magical practitioner of human experimentation is altogether too bound to the chains of reality, so I&#039;ll just refer to his little speech above if you want to get to grips with his character.<br />
<br />
This is not a bad movie. As always for the series, the music and visuals are superb and often achingly beautiful. The achronological structure is interesting and clever. Nasu generally avoids playing to archetype, and though the high-concept, high-falutin&#039;, and determinedly abstract dialogue keeps this well within the field of big R Romance, the characters still emerge, at their best, as far more grounded and mundane than they have any right to. Granted, they have far fewer opportunities to display these qualities than in the other movies, but at least they&#039;re there.<br />
<br />
Yet in spite of all that, the rating must remain 6. This movie&#039;s premise is simply too disconnected from the broader issues it desperately tries to represent. Earlier (and later) instalments in Kara no Kyoukai balanced lore with something more visceral; real human experience was integral to the philosophical babbling. This movie is defiantly obscurantist, and its ideas concerning the meaning of human life are unnecessarily wrought into the ugly template of bubble-headed fantasy concepts. It&#039;s not totally incoherent if you can understand what Choony is saying, but a truly great movie should transcend a niche audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans are poor losers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shut up, Araya.

    The 5th chapter of Kara no Kyoukai brings a new level of epicness to the series. Chapter 5 is arguably the most exciting chapter of the movie series, it surely lived up to its expectations!<br />
<br />
Like how it was mentioned previously, this was a good long 2 hour movie. A major villain of the series is actually featured here, and it was packed with impressive action and drama. The camera works of the action scenes were the best in the series yet.<br />
<br />
At the same time, it talks about one of deepest concepts at the center of the series. What the main villain is trying to accomplish.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12066">
        It&#039;s so vague and difficult to comprehend if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention. Well, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand the logic, it&amp;rsquo;ll surely make you feel like it<br />
<br />
There were some interesting effects with the movie in term of composition. For example, a scene will occasionally jump in advance in timeline, they will sometimes repeat the same scenes over and over, and at another point, they will show what a character thought it happened but didn&amp;rsquo;t. This kind of follows the subtitle of the chapter: Paradox Spiral in an interesting way.<br />
<br />
Three new characters are featured in this movie:<br />
- Tomoe Enjyou<br />
<br />
A red haired boy who was a track sprinter and had high expectations but had to quit and work because of family issues.<br />
<br />
- Cornelius Arba<br />
<br />
A blond haired man wearing a red coat and a hat. An acquaintance of Tohko at the London Mage&amp;rsquo;s Association and just between you and me, this guy is insane and just loves killing :P<br />
<br />
- Souren Araya<br />
<br />
A dark mysterious man who appears in the spiral apartment that Tomoe used to live at. He&amp;rsquo;s supposedly Touko&amp;rsquo;s colleague at the London Mage&amp;rsquo;s association.<br />
<br />
The music, back ground songs were just excellent, i personally loved the music being played during the fighting scenes, no one does them better then Yuki :D<br />
<br />
Over all i would say this was an epic masterpeice with so many twists through the plot, well there is still much to be told but you can only imagine what the last two movies will be like. I can&#039;t wait. Arguably this has got to be one of the best anime series or movie series that i have seen in a long time.<br />

    idk man i watched that movie now and i feel weirdly depressed after that. i dont know what it is about those movies but they just leave me confused and unsatisfied. when i watched the first 3 movies i still had hope, educated myself on the storyline, tried to see through all this mess and understand the plot better. but now after the 5th movie where you would expect some kind of satisfaction and knowledge, it still feels unfamiliar and strange to me. <br />
the plot unfolds in a very chaotic manner and stuff happens at random times and only in the end it happens to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330506">
        make some kind of sense. normally irregular storytelling is not a problem at all and the moment you understand everything and can bring the pieces together you&#039;ll get a feeling of satisfaction and understanding. but even if i understand what happened i still don&#039;t understand why and why this story even exists. it just feels so far away from stuff that makes sense to me so that&#039;s why i am quitting this mess finally for good.<br />
the reason i still rated 6 is bc i still acknowledge the art and effort behind all of that and also i really liked the music. at least it didn&#039;t feel like a total waste of time like serial experiments lain.

    A gap between two hearts.<br />
Unable to both affirm and deny.<br />
Between them, there is nothing.<br />
Between them, there is I.<br />
- Kara no Kyoukai 4: Void Shrine<br />
<br />
The Tetralemma is a spiral that closes in on itself, and dissolves reality with it, and in the process only then can Ultimate Knowledge be known, or the lack of it. A Tetralemma is a Buddhist mental scape, starting with a Proposition, and expounds on the possible truth-values of such propositions. Commonsensically a Proposition has only two truth-values, that of Truth and Falsity. There are two more. The value that verifies both Truth and Falsity, and the value that denies both. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178485">
        negative Tetralemma, then, is the spiral that, after dissolving reality, wraps around on itself, and extinguishes itself into the more than unknown.<br />
<br />
We can consider Kara no Kyoukai, and for that matter the works of Kinoko Nasu, to be based around a Tetralemmic structure of reality, which compounds into an Aegis that denies the postulate while simultaneously affirming it. The form, for example, of Male and Female, juxtaposed onto each other into monstrosity, then it acts upon itself to deny itself of the Male, and returns to the Female. But there is a side that denies both, and that is the Boundary of Emptiness, oblivion, and the deep hole of Nothingness that lies on the other side.<br />
<br />
Likewise the Tetralemma, the self-denying spiral, that takes its roots between affirming and denying itself, balances the world, although, as many in their cowls and robes would state, the entirety eventually falls into that state of Sunyata which none can escape and the no-self is the reign. Any concrete truth, as Araya is soon to realize, is a falsity, even the one that states that concrete truth has to be denied. That is the nature of the Tetralemmic consumption. Which is why a Counter-Force acts against Araya, even though the latter seeks to affirm the Tetralemma.<br />
<br />
We need to keep in mind that the Tetralemma is a self-destroying structure, which in a paradox, hinges on the self. Which means the realization of the Tetralemma can only be conceived on in a self. Likewise Tomoe Enjou only realizes his own non-self, after developing a self by striking out at not just the paradox of the apartment complex, but also the paradox of his ennui-stricken life. In other words, through dependency on others, in a form of dependent becoming, could he realize the self that would negate itself.<br />
<br />
One wonders what madness stricken deluges overcame Kinoko Nasu, who took unto himself to derive this complicated matrix of a system, full of tetralemmic inconsistencies, and verities of power, with walking non-souls that drift in and out of Noir-ridden city streets, and talk about haunted concepts, and strive forward towards apexes of nothing. The master’s eyes shines with secrets. He has made a world of puppets that essentially are aware that they are puppets, and in doing so become more aware than non-puppets about their own natures. <br />
<br />
It is impossible to grasp at the true root of Nasu without beholding oneself to that Tetralemmic figure of knowledge, the knowledge that seeks to state that every knowledge is both falsity, and truth, and perhaps neither.<br />

    I watched this movie two times. The first time I thought it was very impressive, from the animation to the story itself. After the second time, however, I have a very different opinion.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t find the character Tomoe very appealing at first, but after watching it again, I found him to be the only redeeming factor that makes the movie at least worth watching. <br />
<br />
The story is confusing, not really because the events are hard to understand. If you piece the story together in chronological order, it&#039;s a rather simply story. However, the themes are all over the place. That&#039;s what makes the story so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40189">
        confusing. <br />
I understand the movie tries to explore many philosophical subjects but honestly, none of them comes together in the end. It&#039;s not just a matter of leaving a question mark. I feel like the plot simply recycles a lot of well-known truths and throws them at the audience without drawing any line to make them connect. In the end, we are overwhelmed, and that&#039;s the only reason the movie receives high ratings.<br />
<br />
However, Tomoe for me brought back some meaning into the movie. That&#039;s the only reason I&#039;m giving this a decent score. He&#039;s the only character with any development. He went from escaping reality to accepting it and fighting for it. That&#039;s a big jump, especially considering the reality turns more unfavorable on him as the plot progresses. However, his character rebelled against itself and in the end found a satisfactory truth he can fight for.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you are going for a movie with a lot of actions, this isn&#039;t one. But if you want to be simply overwhelmed, this is one. <br />

    ***I have decided to change the format of my reviews to provide more to-the-point ups and downs of the subject in review. I hope people like this new style since the old essay style reviews are tl;dr and just take too long to write. Anyways here is the second anime I&#039;ll review under this new format***<br />
<br />
I had made a review of this before but i lost it on the MAL crash a while ago ;-; so here it goes again. Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen is the fifth and currently the longest running KnK movie to date. This movie really is something special for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14986">
        those who enjoy getting mindfucked. Trust me.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
+ Very unique presentation for the plot<br />
+ Very interesting plot itself once you realize what is going on<br />
+ 2 hour long movie improved the amount of development for characters and plot itself<br />
<br />
- It can very easily confuse the viewer if they are not paying full attention at the movie. Since events in a way are not happening in chronological order.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
+ Fantastic background art<br />
+ Awesome animation considering the fast pace of some scenes<br />
+ Detailed look at decomposing and served people &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
- Some slight weird faces there and then but nothing major<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
+ Fantastic background music, there really isnt much else to say...it was flawless in this category. Hat goes off once again to Kajiura Yuki<br />
<br />
Character<br />
+ Aozaki finally gets some decent screentime and development<br />
+ Shiki is just a very mysterious and interesting character in general<br />
+ Great character development overall, a notch up from the previous movies<br />
<br />
- Kokuto is once again useless and non important &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Easily one of the better anime movies i&#039;ve seen, and by far my favourite Kara no Kyoukai movie yet. This movie made me a fan of the series. Can&#039;t wait for more.<br />
<br />
Overall: If you enjoy deep and complex plots with lots of gore and unique presentation. Then this movie is perfect for you, it brings a very interesting plot, a lot of fantastic action scenes, and overall just a lot of entertainment. Fans of KnK will cum buckets over this. Those who havent watched any of the Kara no Kyoukai movies yet I highly recommend you watch them first, it just makes this movie more awesome and the time spend to just get to this movie will be worth it

    This is part 5 of the KnK series<br />
People told me that the 5th (and 7th) movie of the KnK series is the best out of the 7. After finishing the 4th movie, I watched the 5th movie immediately and they were right. 2 hours of my life....well spent.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]: (10/10)<br />
After getting 3 sequels of a prequel to the 1st KnK, the series finally moves on past the events of the 1st KnK. The 5th movie now takes place 2 months after the events of the 1st KnK. The movie focuses on Shiki, as she meets a boy named Tomoe, a runaway teenager who claims to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196620">
        a murderer. Later, Tomoe see&#039;s her mother whom he&#039;s sure he&#039;s killed. Shiki and Tomoe now investigates the building where her mother was killed. <br />
The story, in my opinion, is a lot better than the previous 4 movies. The first 10-15 minutes of the movie were quite boring but later picks up the steam. The movie is divided into 3 acts (or you can call them short story arcs, I don&#039;t really care), 1st act focuses on Shiki and Tomoe, 2nd act focuses on Mikiya and Touko, and finally the 3rd act which connects all the acts together and explains all the things that&#039;s going on around them. Since this is a spoiler-free review, I won&#039;t explain what really happened in each act. The amount of plot twists this movie has, my god. They&#039;re all so satisfying and all of them made sense when they explained things at the end. The plot may be confusing but trust me, it will all make sense in the end. <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Art/Animation]: (10/10)<br />
This is the 5th movie and I don&#039;t really need to review the animation. It&#039;s perfect from the beginning and it&#039;s still perfect now. The fight scenes are obviously fluid and the character designs looks great. <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Sound]: (10/10)<br />
Ufotable or more accurately Yuki Kajiura should receive an award for one of the best OST&#039;s and Music in anime (I&#039;m sure she already did). The background themes and the battle themes are so well done. Especially the theme used in a fight between Shiki and Araya and Touko and Araya. The Ending Theme used for this movie is &quot;Sprinter&quot; by Kalafina. Once again, Kalafina has done it. Her songs fits perfectly in a dark and psychological movie. The VA&#039;s are exactly the same so my opinion on the VA&#039;s are still the same.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Characters]: (10/10)<br />
1 new character were introduced for this movie which is Tomoe Enjou who happens to bear a similar resemblance to Shirou Emiya from Fate/stay night.<br />
When I first saw this character in the post-credit scene from the 4th movie, I thought I was going to hate this character because he was eating a human and he was enjoying it. After watching this movie, I took back what I thought about him. His past is a sad one and it made perfect sense as to why he did what he just did to his parents. We see more development for Shiki and more of her bad-assness. Hell, even Touko gets to be a badass.  Araya who made a first short appearance in the 2nd movie, now comes back in the 5th movie. All I will say about this villian is he&#039;s not a cliche villian that you see in most animes these days. He clearly had goals and it&#039;s a good one. <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Enjoyment]: (10/10)<br />
The first 10-15 minutes were boring but later, the movie picked up the pace and from them on, I was on the edge of my seat and I was also actively thinking at the plot, wondering what&#039;s going to happen next. The action scenes may be short but they&#039;re still great to watch. <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[OVERALL]: (10/10)<br />
I&#039;m very critical when I give an anime a perfect score of 10. However, this movie amazed me in all 4 categories. Perfect story with interesting plot twists that makes sense, perfect animation, perfect soundtrack that was composed by Yuki, and lovable current and new characters. I didn&#039;t hate any of the characters. Hell, I don&#039;t even hate the villains. If you watched all 4 previous KnK movies then I recommend that you watch this, like now. This is currently the best in the KnK series.

    Welcome, My Friends to film festival week. For those of you who don&#039;t remember, I did this in February of last year looking at Kara no Kyoukai 2 &amp; 3, Ghost in the Shell, Animal Crossing, Blood the last Vampire, Night on the Galactic Railroad &amp; End of Evangelion. This year I&#039;m going to start out the same way I did last year, with another look at Kara no Kyoukai. To give a brief recap of how the series has scored so far, the first film was slow and incredibly stupid. The second film was suspenseful and good. The third film was okay but could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151837">
        have handled its darker content better. The fourth film was excellent with only a few problems. The scores were 2, 7, 6 and 9. So, let&#039;s take a look at the fifth installment and see how it fares. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
<br />
Our tale begins with a burglar breaking into an apartment only to find a corpse. Understandably, he freaks out and gets the police who arrive at the scene only to find the apartment&#039;s owner alive and well much to the burglar&#039;s surprise. Cut to a young man being chased by a group of his peers who seem intent on causing him grievous bodily harm. Enter our heroine, Shiki. She beats the thugs with ease and returns the young man&#039;s dropped keys. He tells her that his name is Enjou Tomoe and he can&#039;t return home as he just murdered his own mother. Being Shiki, she allows him to stay at her apartment. Time passes in an excessively long sequence that recycles the same animation throughout. It finally ends when Tomoe sees his mother, alive and well. He and Shiki go to the apartment complex to investigate. <br />
<br />
So, where does the story fall short? The most obvious failing are the long repeated scenes. The idea behind them is to convey the passage of time, but it just kills the pacing. They could cut these scenes short and get the same effect since they have scenes of Tomoe watching the news and the date gets mentioned during these segments. The only other real problem is that they don&#039;t do a good job of establishing the elements used in the climax until they&#039;re actually used. As such, it feels like they&#039;re being pulled out of nowhere. The one involving Touko in particular. <br />
<br />
That being said, there are a lot of good aspects to the film too. Tomoe&#039;s story arc is really well handled. In spite of certain elements not being established or foreshadowed, the climax is really good too. <br />
I also do like the way they show that plot points are occurring simultaneously and the non-linear structure they use works very well with what they&#039;re doing and does lead to some interesting moments. <br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
<br />
The characters work really well. This probably has the strongest secondary cast of any of these films with the antagonists having developed motivations and Tomoe being a really interesting, sympathetic character. Surprisingly so given how he&#039;s introduced to you. Shiki and Touko remain strong characters. Although Mikiya is a bit weaker in this than he&#039;s been in some of the films. He&#039;s barely important to the narrative, having only a couple scenes that require him to be there. At least he doesn&#039;t spend this film unconscious on a couch with no medical attention to keep his body hydrated and healthy. No, I&#039;m not letting that “how does medicine work?” moment from the first film go. <br />
<br />
Art: <br />
<br />
The art remains excellent. The backgrounds are really detailed. The action sequences are stellar. I will warn you that there is some really disturbing and detailed violent content, including detailed scenes of corpses. The artwork in there looks really good, but it&#039;s still a detailed drawing of something disturbing. The character designs remain the weakest aspect. They are well drawn but pretty standard.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The performances in this are great. Honda Takako, Suzumura Kenichi and Sakamoto Maaya voice the series three leads. They&#039;re joined in this film by Nakata Jouji (Fate/Zero&#039;s Kirei) and Yusa Kouji (Shadow the Hedgehog) as our antagonists. Both of whom do excellent work. Tomoe is voiced by Kakihara Tetsuya, who was also the voice of Simon in Gurren Lagann, and this is probably the strongest performance I&#039;ve heard from him. The music is nice and atmospheric, contributing to both the chaotic and disturbing moments. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay: <br />
<br />
The closest thing you get to ho-yay in this is Mikiya saying he wouldn&#039;t mind if Shiki was a guy. So, thee ho-yay factor is going to be a 1.5. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts: <br />
<br />
This film is not as good as the previous one. It is, however, a great film. It has some problems, but nothing that detracts from it too much. It&#039;s a little slow and there are some things that feel a bit like they were pulled out of nowhere. The narrative is still strong overall with good action and great characters. My final rating is going to be an 8/10. Tomorrow, film festival week continues with a look at a film based on a well known RPG franchise. No, it&#039;s probably not the one you&#039;re thinking of.

    When I started watching Kara no Kyoukai I just thought &quot;oh wel...these movies are entertaining&quot; and nothing more but it was until I watched the movie 5 that I understand the concepts and elements that this movie series really has to offer. It&#039;s in this point that I actually thought that Kara no Kyoukai, with all its flaws, it&#039;s a really good franchise of movies. <br />
<br />
This review will contain spoilers<br />
<br />
This movie is centred In a case that occurred in an apartment where Tomoe Enjou claims to have murdered his mother, in his escape and dealing with his old friends he manages to meet the protagonist,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356863">
        Ryougi Shiki, it will then be under that presumption by which the plot of this will move movie, focusing on Enjou and the mystery behind the apartment where he lived and murdered his parents.<br />
<br />
First off it&#039;s necessary to make an aclaration and is that this movie can easily be the first of the movies that actually make a progresion and that is noticeable because in the first film an emphasis was placed on events from all the other films (allusion is made to the fight against Fujino, Shiki killing and his recovery from the hospital) so from the first moment we could take this film as the turning point between the anachronies and the time jumps of the films, this is very important because it is in fact in this film where many unknowns that the previous films left and even this fifth film being analyzed as a separate product conclude of the other films also shines for its own reasons that we will explain below.<br />
<br />
After the 4 previous films this is presented in a different way, the presentation does not focus on Mikiya and Shiki as such, but on Enjou and they present you from the first moment a strange scene that uses a little recurrent and extravagant narrative for which the viewer should be absolutely clear from the first moment that the follow-up of the films could become more strange and complex than the rest, this is reinforced by the simple fact that when Shiki welcomes Enjou into his house (when he opens the door ) use animation and transition to move from scenes in a really unfair way, that presentation is key because from the first moment the film makes it totally clear who will be the key, how animation will be used, the use of narration and how and where will the anachronies be located.<br />
Something good about the positioning of this film in the chronological line is that the world, atmosphere and tone are marked from long before (it is true that the fourth film may seem simpler, but the atmosphere and tension remain the same) and this film does not presents no hint of changing that and even this film wants to deal with more complex elements throughout the work, dark colors and the use of shadows precisely is something key, Ufotable is well known for knowing how to set situations in dark elements and from this film is noticeable because the most key and conclusive elements occur at night to convey the feeling of gloom felt by the protagonists in front of the antagonists (this is too noticeable when Shiki faces Araya for the first time and she is devoured by the department) which in that sense this film is responsible for dragging all the above from the films (for better or for worse) and develop and exploit it to its favor with the context that this movie is really the only moment so far where you can feel tension when you find yourself after the first movie chronologically, that is precisely the reason why this is the first movie where the enemy actually manages to corner Shiki and even represents a mortal threat to all the characters, although the scene of Cornelius murdering Touko seems to me the greatest example of this, the truth is that that feeling of tension is totally destroyed because Touko was not dead in the end and the explanation is that she had a doll just like her which seemed totally far-fetched and to top it off Cornelius dies in that scene ... without having done anything important in the plot despite the fact that her presentation and foreshadowing in the film was key for the very development of this and that seemed to me a total waste of the character (it is not possible to match what Cornelius presented and incited in the plot so that later he does absolutely nothing and even his wacky scenes are reduced to nothing in the movie). Basically of the 2 antagonists presented, only one is really well achieved (Araya) while the other is totally wasted (Cornelius) and even so Araya&#039;s flashbacks are insufficient to fully explain his reasons and justification for the acts, it is not that Araya is A bad antagonist is simply that Kara no Kyoukai has a bad habit of always cutting off her antagonists in the end (see Fujino), Araya has a brutal presentation that practically encompasses the character in its entirety and even afterwards his actions in the movie have a meaning very relevant and stars in the best scenes in addition to presenting the symbolism of existentialism and how that philosophy led him to devise a plan to try to &quot;save&quot; the world by finding the root (which I also loved because he made the first direct relationship with Fate / Zero and in a simple and effective way) Araya&#039;s execution is actually quite good but the character&#039;s foundations and his Ideologies fail quite a bit even at the end of the film and that disappointed me as he could easily have become the great antagonist of Kara no Kyoukai (although it is not the same that Kara no Kyoukai stands out in large part for its antagonists).<br />
<br />
And since we are saying that the monitoring and the use of the camera there are quite good scenes like the scene where Shiki and Enjou enter the apartment where the murder of the entire Enjou family is repeated over and over again, specifically him as the murderous mother. the father has a very natural follow-up and it could even be said that it was monotonous for what was shown to be a murder and that is that the same scene poses it to you as a mockery of reality and something stupid but it is real, if we actually remember when Shiki tells him that the scene in front of him is real at that moment the screen changes to show us a man on TV making fun of a program making allusion to this, it is a simple murder that has been repeated thousands of times and does not have No sign of being serious or anything new and it is due to the ingenuity of Ufotable that a simple scene of less than 5 minutes can convey the feeling of stupidity and incredibleness of a character in such a complex and creative way.<br />
<br />
I also find the scene of the final fight between Araya and Shiki phenomenal, they are very well animated since the use of Shiki&#039;s sword in front of Araya&#039;s fists has a brutal follow-up that, without confusing the viewer, moves the camera sharply from one side to the other following the sword in a convenient way so as not to lose any movement, thus turning a fairly normal combat into one that manages to meet the expectations of the character, in addition to the scene of both falling is the perfect conclusion to the entire combat Aesthetically speaking, since the combat ends with a simple direct scene of how Shiki falls from the building next to Araya in order to directly end the combat and even the OST accompanies wonderfully well and that is because Dat OST is a matter of looking for the OST on YouTube M19 + M20 &quot;(movie 3) and buy it with the OST&quot; M24 ​​&quot;of this fifth movie and it is that Mujun Rasen&#039;s OST is more rushed with a contrast in quieter moments and the more tense or moving and that is why this OST specifically fits this movie very well in particular because the OST perfectly matches the rhythm with the final scene between Shiki and Araya, that is something that I very rarely see well in this In case, the difference between the previous OSTs denotes a comparison between the reserved fights that Kara no Kyoukai had before with those that she has now that are widely different, with an emphasis now really on action and movements.<br />
<br />
And it is precisely the narration that gave me the most enjoyment in the first bars of the film, I would dare to say that no scene is in the film just because yes, everything has a reason why it is (either symbolic or as a weight in the plot) and time jumps are not an exception, each one of them is made with cohesion between the events that occurred in the past and those that will occur in the future (when Enjou sees the fight between Shiki and Araya he returns to Shiki&#039;s house and there we go back to the past to narrate from Mikiya&#039;s perspective), these anachronies are well presented throughout the entire film precisely to the game that he does with animation because Ufotable, beyond animating well, knew how to animate these movies.<br />
These temporal jumps also help to complement scenes with each other, when Enjou is in the street watching Cornelius follow Shiki it is one of the best examples because in that same scene it is naturally allowed to see that Touko and Mikiya were by his side without Enjou would realize, it is precisely scenes like this that give cohesion and coherence to the actions that the characters do because this same scene indirectly asks you &quot;what is Mikiya and Touko doing here?&quot; And it is obvious that you will ask yourself that question because in that same scene introduces us to the character of Cornelius who, by the simple fact of seeing the design and the angles they give him, gives us to understand that he will be an antagonistic and new character. The funny thing is that precisely when the film focuses on Mikiya&#039;s perspective, that scene that I just mentioned obtains a clear emphasis on the follow-up of the department&#039;s case, which is why the mistery that was presented to us in that scene before is now taken from Another perspective and gets a different meaning than it had before (there are many examples like those in the movie) and that also serves as a continuation for when the viewer feels confused due to the anachronies, when Shiki receives the sword from Mikiya we are presents in a short scene in which Shiki returns home and meets Enjou and then tells him about the sword that Mikiya gave her so when we go to Mikiya&#039;s perspective there is precisely a scene in which it is shown in it how Mikiya gives the sword to Shiki and why he gives her the sword and that&#039;s brilliant because it help the spectator to ubique the event because there are really much scenes like that and that&#039;s help you to understand the movie at the same time that the movie introduce those scenes naturally and with a good approach.<br />
<br />
And to describe in a simple way it seems to me that the passing/rhythm is precise and very uniform related to the exposition because despite the fact that the content of the film is complex at no time does it fill you or kill you with information, instead it bothers to explain the characters and events in a more cryptic way, so it does not feel monotonous or turn it into a stupid textual and repeated explanation, it is true that near the middle of the film there are some elements and relationships between characters explained in a vague and sudden way (the relationship between Ryouko and Araya together with Cornelius seems to me totally out of pocket), passing has the The benefit is precisely that it comes according to the movie, the necessary emphasis in the scenes makes the moments feel natural and with a goal, for example the scene where Shiki talks on the phone with Mikiya and Enjou asks if she is okay and Shiki She responds that she is angry with Mikiya because he left without saying anything, that scene not only emphasizes the growing relationship that they have developed and that very thing. It will also impact the evolution that Enjou will have in the same movie.<br />
<br />
Well we talked about the amazing storytelling and the very good cohesion along with a pretty good rhythm that fits the events and the moment, now the characters and the other elements that make this movie so good.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves remain very similar to what we saw in the previous movies, Shiki and Mikiya have deepened their relationship and it shows by some short scenes and by various dialogues that Shiki has as the movie progresses and Touko shows a new one facet that he had never shown in all the movies which was ruthless and accurate in killing Cornelius in a simple and fast way, which, although it is interesting, is really not a big thing and you can even forget it for the next movie, but the character that really stands out here is Enjou Tomoe.<br />
<br />
Enjou Tomoe symbolizes almost everything the film wants to convey, free will and acting on your own, being really free in a world and a life where you were predestined to do predetermined things or you are predetermined to meet predetermined people, it&#039;s not just that The evolution of Enjou and its parallelism with Shiki (a real murderer) is in vain because how the personality of Enjou Tomoe softens and even how he sympathizes with his family are scenes that clearly show how he progresses slowly throughout the entire film and even so it brutally reinforces the contrast between Mikiya, the one who helped him accept his family, with Shiki who simply knows how to kill because this makes it clear that Mikiya despite everything that has happened in previous films continues to maintain his word and humble personality just like he said he was going to do it in the second movie. <br />
Returning to Enjou then the existentialist and philosophical aspect of the film is largely due to him since it is in the final scene where he discovers that the character&#039;s final conclusion is an &quot;impostor&quot;, even if Enjou was not real and was not destined to exist. In this world he achieved something, he felt the affection for a moment of his parents, he felt a friendship with Mikiya and, above all, he felt in love and inspired by Ryougi Shiki ... The only person who at one point tried to save him and Help him, his final dialogue against Araya is very good, how Araya tells him that he is an impostor and that he was programmed from the same idea that Araya had to let go of him to fall in love with Shiki until he told him that he did not care about anything ... Basically THAT Enjou did not existed and yet Enjou replied &quot;I existed here&quot; resulting in the outcome of the character, his catharsis with his family was present from the beginning and his emotions were explored throughout the work and it is because of that that the dialogue The end is so significant because Enjou reaffirms his existence, he helped Shiki because he really felt it and even so he managed to belong to something and had a home, the emphasis and metaphor of the keys is precisely important because of this moment because Enjou knew it existed because he found a home and someone to protect, the perfect conclusion for a character who, being introduced in this movie and nothing else, forms as the outcome not only of the film&#039;s philosophy but as the entire character as such.<br />
<br />
Even so, if we analyze the other characters beyond everything, it is not that they are neither bad nor simple, far from it, it is that this movie tries to show parts of the personalities of other characters in order to reaffirm what has been seen previously and thus finish the characterization of these, Mikiya forgives Enjou and his relationship with him shows us the closest we had so far (not counting at school) to seeing him with a friend and chatting with someone, previously we were shown that Mikiya was such a good person that even He could play a rapist and in this film we are shown that he even managed to empathize with a murderer because his relationship with Shiki was the same as that of Mikiya himself ... Outside of that there is really very little to say, Mikiya was always taken by the work as an opposite to Shiki and as someone who does not forgive the murder (despite the fact that in a certain way Shiki is) and even so, under that remarked idea, he managed to develop together with Enjou because he knew of first moment that Enjou was not a bad person.<br />
<br />
With Ryougi Shiki it is curious because it is in this movie where we are shown with combat with Ryougi Shiki instead of Shiki, many could consider this a Deus Ex Machina and my answer would be well ... No, Shiki&#039;s personality change was present Throughout all of Kara no Kyoukai and even the very construction of the world of the movies make it totally clear the change between both Shiki&#039;s personalities, even so the fact that Shiki changes his personality through the use of the sword is something that will charge relevance later and in fact the Deus Ex Machina as a rule in themselves are not something negative and this in particular is not because it is the collusion and conclusion of ideas that one can unite oneself from the previous films (the use of the sword Shiki talks about in film 2) and, as I say, this scene and final combat does not ruin the world that Kara no Kyoukai built in the other films, for which it does not ruin neither the scene nor the thing raised in advance and, in fact , reinforces it in an effective and simple way that is also not far-fetched, therefore no, the participation of this personality of Shiki is neither far-fetched nor something negative, it is a matter of paying attention in the previous films and uniting the ideas that exposed the movies from their very beginning.<br />
<br />
But speaking of Shiki in general as a character ... The truth is very similar to that with Mikiya, there is not much to get out but in this case it is justified because Shiki&#039;s personality is raised in the first film, in the second the bases are shown, In the third it is reinforced and in the fourth one sees the conclusion that Shiki reached after the hospital incident, therefore the Shiki of this movie is an amalgamation of what we have seen in all of Kara no Kyoukai and that makes it special because Shiki maintains elements of all the movies and does it correctly, his desire for murder but also how he withholds himself, his relationship and attraction to Mikiya and how he opened his heart to other people. Shiki in this film is easily the most human and the one that most demonstrates the conclusions reached before and that is why I considered Shiki as a good character here for the mere fact of representing everything she achieved and presented in a natural, credible and with a context and dialogue that are just good.<br />
<br />
I would stop at the OST but I really talked about the OST before ... It is simply incredible and easily one of the best I have heard, what distinguishes it from the other OST I have heard is that precisely in Kara no Kyoukai the sounds used, instruments and the moment they make the scene what it is, it is a set of all the elements in which a work should think when placing an OST and make it unique precisely for a scene that, even pretending it, can be unique, the haunting setting and mysterious also serves to accompany the scenes and is that in this Mujun Rasen is precisely where the mystery most lurks in the environment, the mystery of the apartments is simply rare at first and may even seem uninteresting, but it is due to the explanations that are given later when one can understand that Araya merged with the departments in order to carry out his plan, it is true that some explanations sound quite incoherent as e The fact that the elevator changes the stairways but there is the funny thing, it is a &quot;spiral paradox&quot; that is extravagant as such, in a way even so I was never convinced by this argument so I remain neutral to it as explained by the departments ( being the central axis of Mujun Rasen) because they could have given more clues about how the department works as such without resorting to vague explanations or an exposition that simply does not solve anything or is totally sudden ... Even so, the mystery unfolds well one Once we reach the end.<br />

Little more to tell the truth, I talked about the excellent use of animation and dark colors, the presentation and transition of scenes together with the tracking of the camera in specific scenes that I loved, the characters as such, without being a big deal, they excel and manage to fulfill their role in the film in one way or another, the OST and the passing along with the incredible narration, exposition and the philosophy that the character of Enjou carries on himself. My problem with this movie is simply the convenience in the script that it has on several occasions, Touko&#039;s relationship with Cornelius and Araya seems to me out of nowhere along with the same doll that she had that was identical (in itself Touko seemed easily to me the most bland and bad thing about the movie), Cornelius is wasted and they could have delved a little deeper into characters like Mikiya ... But all of that is minimized when you see and appreciate the brutality that Ufotable has done here, almost all things bad things can be easily overshadowed by the excellent things that this movie brings, specifically the narration that I think is one of the best in all anime (not only because of its structure but also because of its operation) and finally to clarify some things, the fact that Enjou be an impostor YES it makes sense and an easy explanation (for something Enjou always dreamed of his mother killing him because it was his other clones who died on that occasion and since Shiki and Enjou They enter the departments, this idea is clearly stated), the film simply does not treat you as stupid and even so it serves a lot to capture the philosophy of the film and most importantly, if you find the film pretentious then I invite you to read the I finish, learn it, watch the movie again and intelligently and there you will tell me if this movie is pretentious. Personally, I loved it, it almost does not fail in anything it proposes and it is an experience that for me is unique in this world of anime ... You should definitely give it a try.

    If you are looking for something that could blow your mind away, this is what you WANT to check out. First thing that sticks out a mile is blood. Blood and gore. But unlike previous Kara no Kyoukai movies Mujun Rasen is a little bit less bloody and is more focused on action and story, which as I dare to think, makes it a lot more attractive. But it definetly kept that dark ambience of predecessors, and it is still Kara no Kyoukai. So It seems like after four inconsequent movies which made a sort of introduction, we finally got a perfect complete movie. <br />
That

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84791">
        was a half of a cake. The other half is visuals, which are outstanding. The most of the time of watching anime is usually spent on tv series where graphics are mediocre. So it is really good to see an anime with such a wonderful animation and graphics. <br />
<br />
P.S. Now I can confidently say that it is so worth watching all the Kara no Kyoukai movies. Peace out :D

    First four movies left us guessing a lot, so I expected a final info of some sort but didn&#039;t happen. A lot of raw information was displayed and it didn&#039;t quite catch my attention, as a result I wasn&#039;t fully invested. <br />
<br />
Animation and Sound were amazing in this movie, there are some very nicely animated scenes and the music was straight outta SAO which is really good, the relationship between the characters wasn&#039;t so bad either. <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a 6 (fine) for me, because I didn&#039;t understand the motives of the main villains, the magic powers of magus weren&#039;t explained at any point, but were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349335">
        teased at points in a slightly edgy way.<br />
<br />
I understand that there is a certain charm in keeping the viewers guessing, but there are limits.<br />

    ~ Enchanting, contemplative, deep, exciting, fantastic...<br />
<br />
Kara no Kyoukai 5: Musen Rasen is a rare kind of work among the other movies from the series and even anime in general. Right from the get-go, the viewer gets immersed in a story so deep and enticing that it becomes almost impossible to pause. Now, it&#039;s rather complex, without a doubt, but answers slowly find their way out as everything seemingly connects to each other. As incredible as this movie is, there are a few bits and pieces that need work, giving it a 9/10.<br />
<br />
Story: The most impressive aspect of this work, the story begins with a scramble

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12410">
        of scenes which are admittedly brutal, but far from boring. As the title suggests, the plot is like a paradox in that nothing seems to come together and the order of events is very erratic. Don&#039;t worry because it all makes sense once you near the conclusion. You could always rewatch it in the case nothing makes sense the first time around. The movie has an expanded scope compared to the other episodes of Kara no Kyoukai since we see mages other than Touko. For the first time, the audience gets introduced to who the mages are and what their goals consist of. Although the focus happened to be more on Tomoe than the mages, Kara no Kyoukai 5 maintains a commanding storyline that entertains viewers from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
Animation: Although I&#039;ve seen cleaner animation from other anime movies, KnK dominates with its fluid action scenes and clear textures. However, I feel that they could&#039;ve drawn Araya&#039;s face better, considering that all you can see are hidden eyes and emphasized wrinkles. I get that there&#039;s a mysterious factor in casting a shadow over his eyes, but that&#039;s a bit too far. Also, there are indeed drops in animation quality from here to there, but I&#039;m no perfectionist, so this isn&#039;t a big deal.<br />
<br />
Sound: Again, amazing from beginning to end. Nothing was clearly out of place and Kalafina sings great as usual. I admit some sound effects may have been overly stressed, particularly when body parts are snapped, but the weapons and effects were well-executed.<br />
<br />
Character: Some ups and downs with this one. I am satisfied to see development in Touko and the mages, seeing that they were shrouded in mystery for the past several episodes. She also participates in a battle, much to my delight. However, we see much less development in Kokuto when he had plenty of potential with his new skills in detective work. Considering that he&#039;s the male protagonist, I was expecting much more out of him. Conversely, we see too much development in Tomoe (Yes, too much). Although he&#039;s a new character, he lacked any sort of appeal and I found pitying him rather difficult. Most of the time, I just wished he would just exit the scene so we could move on. I only hope that the next episodes of KnK will develop the characters of Shiki and Kokuto now that the topic of mages has come into the light.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I couldn&#039;t stop watching honestly as the movie kept me on the edge the entire time. Somehow, the idea of a chaotic plot just kept me glued to my screen. Actually, the plot&#039;s so complex that a second viewing is necessary, adding in some replay value. However, there are about three action scenes in a period of two hours which might trouble some viewers.  In reality, the story is what drives the plot all the way to the end, so don&#039;t expect a pointless video of non-stop fighting.<br />
<br />
Despite minor flaws, KnK ranks as one of my favorite movies with its intricate storytelling and masterful use of special effects. Just the way how the events all link together brings a feeling of satisfaction and enjoyment, even with the chaotic timeline of events. Sure, it&#039;ll get you thinking a bit, but then again, what&#039;s wrong with that?

    Out of the 7 movies of the &quot;Garden of Sinners&quot; series, this is my personal favorite. It combines all the best aspects of the series in one complete package in terms of a well-scripted plot, art direction and atmosphere. The editing and visual imagery consist of some of the most imaginative and compelling of this series, or of any other.<br />
<br />
The plot revolves around the mystery of an apartment complex that represents more than just a place for people to live...and die. What happens there to its residents is the motif of the movie, specifically from the point of view of one young man who is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88627">
        essentially the &quot;protagonist&quot; in this story. Since this is the 5th movie of this franchise, I will assume the reader will already be aware of the background behind the major characters and overall story.<br />
<br />
The strengths of this movie, as well as the series overall, reside in the atmosphere and art design--the artwork beautifully sets the tone and mood of the storytelling. When action breaks out, the animation is suitably fluid as well, but the real highlights are the use of color, light and dark. There are shots that echo the masterful lighting used by Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut to symbolize psychological spaces. The non-linear editing is also a hallmark of the &quot;Garden of Sinners&quot; franchise and it is used to the best effect here, complementing the sense of unease and mental confusion that the characters must be feeling. Time, slices of time, the passage of time, and the cycle of time are an essential theme of this movie and the editing is used to great effect to show this. <br />
<br />
In anime and other stories of the floating world, the Japanese have a fascination with appreciating the moments in life that make life mean something--not in transcendental fireworks but in the periods of time where human activity occurs: waking and sleeping, eating, the clink of utensils on dishes, getting dressed, greeting and goodbye--in other words, the rituals of daily living on this tragic mortal coil. The paradox that the magical thinkers such as Araya try to plumb, studying this mechanical cycle, dissecting it and trying to tease out what makes the whole thing tick...this is the essential mystery that the movie itself is trying to depict. Perhaps the best answer any of us can give is to simply plead, &quot;I was here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Similar to other famous TYPE-MOON franchise, the Fate series, the central themes revolve around existential questions about the human condition in a corrupted universe populated with a unique fusion of Eastern and Western mysticism (Buddhism, Gnosticism and Zoroastrianism plus various magical conventions of mystic circles, runes, spirits, fairies, etc.) that seems to be the hallmark of the creator, Nasu Kinoko. As such, Majun Rasen represents the tightest, well-crafted entry into this universe I&#039;ve seen so far.<br />
<br />

    Spent the whole week finishing the Kara no Kyoukai series 1-7+Mirai Fukuin+Extra chorus <br />
<br />
And honestly this movie stood out the most just in every way! It really just test your ability to follow along with a story and the amount intelligence thrown at you that you can handle. The twist and turns and pay off in the end is well worth the watch whether you&#039;re a fan of the series or not this is one not to miss! <br />
<br />
Long story short... I would compare this movie to something like &quot;Death Note&quot; not to much hack and slash action but the smartness of the movie and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210315">
        plot twist they have for you are what&#039;ll keep you buckled in for the 2 hour ride.<br />

    Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen (Paradox Paradigm) review<br />
<br />
&quot;Araya what do you seek?&quot;<br />
&quot;True Wisdom&quot;<br />
&quot;Araya where do you seek it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Only within myself&quot;<br />
&quot;Araya where are you trying to reach?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#039;s obvious. To the end of this paradox spiral of a world.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fifth installment of the Kara no Kyoukai series takes an different approach compared to it&#039;s earlier chapters. This time not only the movie is longer (almost 2h), it has changes in it&#039;s direction and storytelling. Using gimmicks that show us just how talented the staff at ufotable truly is.<br />
<br />
Before delving deeper into the review i wanted to point out that i have read all Kara no Kyoukai

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361679">
        novels. I already knew what i was getting myself into and that this movie would adapt in my opinion the best chapter in the whole franchise.<br />
<br />
This movie takes place roughly around two months after the event of Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan fuukei (Overlooking View). It is split into two arcs (Shiki&#039;s and Mikiya&#039;s) that take place around the same time.<br />
<br />
Shiki&#039;s arc begins with a boy named Tomoe Enjou, who is saved from a group thugs by Ryougi Shiki. He claims to have committed parricide, she then allows him to use her residence as a hideout. Few days later Tomoe is shaken to discover that his mother is alive, even though he is convinced that he killed her. Then they go the newly constructed Ogawa apartment complex where he committed the murder to uncover the truth.<br />
<br />
Mikiya&#039;s arc begins with him investigating a tip that his associate Touko Aozaki receives regarding the murder at the Ogawa apartment complex. Mikiya takes interest in Tomoe Enjou and decides to investigate him further. Which makes him discover the disturbing and cruel truth about that unique apartament complex.<br />
<br />
Each entry in Kara no Kyoukai always had a small cast, but this time the amount of important characters is noticeably bigger. The main characters are given their own spotlight which makes them not one-dimensional. The returning trio: Ryougi Shiki, Kokutou Mikiya and Aozaki Touko. As well the newly introduced Tomoe Enjou. This chapter&#039;s antagonist is Araya Souren who was apparently an colleague/associate of Touko. Sadly i can&#039;t go into full dept as to why he&#039;s an amazing villain since it I would have to go into the spoiler territory, but his characterization and motives make him a great character. I mean he&#039;s voiced by Kirei (Fate/Stay Night) so you already know what to expect.<br />
<br />
The music in Kara no Kyoukai is phenomenal. It is arranged by none other than Yuki Kajiura so you already know that you&#039;re in a feast. I instantly bought the full soundtrack. I consider it not only to be one the best works by her, but i could even argue it&#039;s one of the best in any anime i&#039;ve seen. As well the ending song &quot;sprinter&quot; by Kalafina is so epic that it enhances the experience even more.<br />
<br />
From the technical standpoint Kara no Kyoukai 5 doesn&#039;t disappoint. From the amazing studio ufotable it is no shock that the movie looks amazing and that the animation is consistent and for it&#039;s time still looks better than most of the stuff coming out nowadays.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the review i said that the movie uses gimmicks that shows just how amazing at film making is the director. Kara no Kyoukai 5 felt different compared to it&#039;s earlier instalment due to it&#039;s visual presentation/techniques.The director wanted to convey the feeling of paranoia and spiral-like effect. To give a drier and more mundane feel, film grain was added alongside giving the film a more orange hue, the camera was pulled back to create greater distance with the viewer, as well repetition of the scenes and changing the order of the events.<br />
<br />
Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujen Rasen is a movie which i deeply love and for any nasuverse fan it was an amazing gift. From it&#039;s direction to storytelling and characterization. I consider it to be the best adaptation of any nasuverse work to date.<br />
