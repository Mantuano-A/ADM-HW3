    Mushoku tensei is great, probably even the best anime of this year<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean c&#039;mon mushoku tensei is So good that you don&#039;t even have to be a isekai fan to love it <br />
<br />
Gorgeous Art i mean real beautiful , most of this can be used as 4K art assets for AAA video games , Mushoku tensei doesn&#039;t stop giving us new desktop screensavers in every freaking frame. Animations in battles are crisp and almost no recognizable 3D is ever on screen due to clever camera placement .<br />
<br />
Great characters , each easily Distinguishable, the Girls are not in the anime just be waifus and are actual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421922">
        people (and waifus) ,Rudy the main Focus , is a complex and flawed character who you aren&#039;t supposed to like (actually you pity the guy more often than not)but sometimes he can be a real bro .  <br />
<br />
The music is easily so creative it is an all time classic like bebop or champloo. It sets the atmosphere so well. Upbeat but still medieval,the kind that made us admire the unskippable opening since it is also filled with additional Art .VA is well done the switching between old rudy and young rudy is done so well that even tho they are distinctly different we always know they are the same person the other characters have great established seiyuus as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story is where mushoku tensei really excels it goes to different tangents from a very simple premise without making it feel odd the main goal of MC was not decided at reincarnation like IMMA DEFEAT DEMON LORD or anything its always been down to earth like , I just gotta earn money for my best friends sylphy’s tuition , i gotta help eris get home , it&#039;s my responsibility as her teacher and most importantly I just need to live my life properly and without regrets (that is basically the full title of this anime).<br />
<br />
<br />
Mushoku Tensei is truly a benchmark good Isekai anime. Hell, I believe it Should BE THE BENCHMARK anime due to the sheer potential it has in all forms: beautiful Art, immersive story, well written characters . its a modern masterpiece and I am glad that the studio incharge seems equally as passionate as we fans are for this adaptation.<br />
<br />
the main concern is pedophilia.....<br />
<br />
1)He may look like an ugly bastard straight out of hentai in his previous life but there is more to Rudy than meets the eye. Rudy is fundamentally a 17-year-old kid at the start of the anime. Yes I know he is physically 37 but a thing or two about his MENTAL GROWTH: His growth stopped exactly at the point when he refused to communicate work or even interact with society in any tangible form (look up Genie, the feral child in google if you wish to know what happens to people who totally disconnect), yes one might say he still had his computer and all that but would I really call that mental Growth? I&#039;ll call it mental deterioration, learning all sorts of nefarious things that the internet has plenty of. Even if he got any good advice from his parents or the internet he won&#039;t take it since he feels “this is only a trap to make him go back outside”, hence he is just a 17-year-old boy with nothing for a moral compass except whatever his broken brain approves of (including pedophilia) and a loose understanding the laws of civilized society (through his education till highschool and online experiences).<br />
<br />
2)Main character in an isekai must be A kirito clone or an Edgelord <br />
Rudy makes several mistakes all the time he tries to make things right , but fails . tries to find an easy way out , fails . Thinks he can just use talk no jutsu against criminals , and fails again. The Thing is he is so broken he still believes that the GALGAME simulation self that he tries the create is the best solution and in a way is still failing to accept that this is his new reality and the consequences are real and the death flag is NOT A RESET POINT anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)MC must be a badass ice-cold killer who kills enemies like flies<br />
He still is unable to because well it&#039;s too violent and raw for someone who has led a peaceful like Him he may have great power but he has yet to cross the line. Moreover, someone who has always been meek and submissive his entire life cannot easily come to terms with such a deed, THE DUDE WAS A BYSTANDER IN HIS OWN LIFE how can we expect him to act on such an ordeal.

    **WARNING REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS**<br />
“Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.”<br />
<br />
Every once in awhile an anomaly occurs which shakes to our very foundation. For the masses the distinction is straightforward, whether love or hate, brilliant or idiotic, trascend. For example, when the Dragon Maid got a second season , it was immediate and sustained adoration, Tokyo Revengers on the other hand was bombed with Negative Reviews written by intellectually sane people. But to explain why the public supports or denounces a particular thing is next to impossible, as it culminates from the attitude of the era and chance. One thing, however,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421926">
        is certain: ingrained perceptions are difficult, if not impossible to change.<br />
Once a Garbage, always a Garbage. Once a Masterpiece, always a Masterpiece. Once considered an Isekai, always an Isekai.<br />
<br />
The problem with the love/hate dynamic is that critical evaluation is sparse, and if an outsider decides to scrutinize the work with a critical eye, he is often castigated for not falling in line or ridiculed for not understanding the core themes.<br />
<br />
Such in case with Mushoku Tensei. It&#039;s often hailed for deconstructing the basic Tropes of the infamous Isekai genre.<br />
The stigma of the Isekai genre is not only to attributed to corny power fantasies and harem, but also poor worldbuilding and flat generic Protagonist.<br />
Recently, writers have attempted deconstruction to remove the negative stigma. Ranging from worldbuilding power fantasies like Overlord to comical parodies like Konosuba to edgy revenge garbage like Rising of the shield hero. Possibilities are infinite, however many have fell short due to industry&#039;s disposition to quick cash grabs.<br />
<br />
Mushoku Tensei is reowned for its great worldbuilding, realistic magic system, great characterisation and unorthodox use of Isekai tropes however it fails to execute it properly.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 4/10<br />
Starting from the Characters, we have Rudeus who masturbated in his parents funeral, an unlikeable personality trait that can easily make the audience dislike him in his first impressions.<br />
But, for the audience to sympathize with his antics the author attempts to create a tragic backstory, he was bullied and tormented in his previous life. I expected him to change his insatiable lust in his &quot;SECOND LIFE&quot; but it gets worse as the story progresses. Apparently, there is an attempt to give him some depth however, when he doesn&#039;t overcome his fatal flaws, how can we even consider him well written Character?<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s ignore the MC for a while and talk about the MC&#039;s harem, I mean the secondary cast-<br />
<br />
Roxy: She&#039;s the one who taught our MC Magic and apparently she&#039;s a Mary Sue intelligent, wise, kind and humble. No interesting personality otherwise.<br />
Eris: How can a harem be complete without a tomboyish Tsundere who hits every male that comes around her vicinity.<br />
Sylphiette: Here we are finally the girl who loves the MC with extreme loyalty. Her only trait is that she&#039;s childish and brave. As her age is same as our Pedo Protagonist, she&#039;s often the victim of his uncomfortable antics.<br />
Unfortunately, all of them adhere to a certain character archetype and lack necessary depth. No need of any reminder that they&#039;re also tools for fanservice for majority of the screentime.<br />
<br />
The Antagonists are all one dimensional, predictable and generic that it can even make Genthru of Greed Island look very complex in comparison.<br />
<br />
STORY 3/10<br />
I expected a coming of an age story with groundbreaking levels of Character development and great exposition to worldbuilding but sadly this turned out to be another male power fantasy. The magic system is quite simple consisting of simple spell chanting instead of RPG power levels.<br />
<br />
The worst thing about this show is how it&#039;s core central theme is diverted and it suffers from a identity crisis, whether it&#039;s a Ecchi or adventure story. It disguises itself as a redemption story but fails to deliver any subtle acceptable Character development. Male domination (Just like every other Isekai or Harem) is the main issue of this show. Every other female character are degraded and reduced to either tools of fanservice or MC&#039;s Harem sextoy. The fact that he never changes his core flaws but instead becomes worse or according to Isekai Standards STRONGER (Bigger Harem) makes this nothing but rather a wish fulfilment Male Power Fantasy.<br />
<br />
The worldbuilding is boring in the current and subsequent arcs with generic dungeons and fantasy creatures (Sex Toy) introduced with even more generic elements. There&#039;s no novelty or creativity present.<br />
In my opinion, even Black Clover (One of the worst Shounen) has better female cast and fight scenes with actual tension than this poor man&#039;s attempt of Re:ZERO and Konosuba. The Standards of Isekai have degraded so low that even a pedophilic Edgy Protagonist is adored by the community. Even Itachi&#039;s redemption which was one of the worst written parts of Naruto was better than this Male Power Fantasy.<br />
Even Togashi, the greatest Shounen writer can write a decent Isekai better than 90% Isekai writers of the Industry. Go check out Yu Yu Hakusho or re-watch the Greed Island Arc of HunterXHunter it&#039;s way better.<br />
<br />
Overall 33/100<br />
&quot;We need fantasy not to escape the reality, but rather survive the reality.&quot;

    Mushoku tensei is a masterpiece that has no equal in terms of imersiveness and worldbuilding and the undeniable anime of the year, here&#039;s why: (Spoilers)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna edit this review when new episodes come out but my opinion will probably not change since it&#039;s the same quality maybe even better than season 1.<br />
<br />
This show is an isekai about a 34 years old pedophile/NEET who gets reincarnated as a baby in another world with magic and swords and do erotic things to girls that are physically his age but not mentally. <br />
<br />
I think I can&#039;t describe this show any worse and what I said is true, on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421951">
        paper this seems like the most generic/degenerate show ever and somehow people including me love it, but why, how a show like that can be that good when There is the most despisable character in all of anime and the word Isekai in it.<br />
I&#039;m gonna answer that question right now and it&#039;s gonna be long.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna start at season 1 cause I want to talk about it as a 2 cour anime where the second part is delayed because the two of them are heavily intertwined. <br />
<br />
In the first minutes of the first episode we know exaclty at what type of main characters we are gonna face, a scumbag, an unlikeable piece of garbage, and shortly after that we are introduced to this new world with magic and swords, we can notice an interesting artisitic choice by the studio, that fact that when he talks he has his child voice and when he thinks he has his old 34 y/o voice its pretty uncommon for this genre, the show doesn&#039;t want you to forget that he is a scumbag and it offers a nice contrast in some dialogue and sound more real when he thinks about big brain strategies or questionable thoughts (you know what I fucking mean)<br />
<br />
And thus begin the training arc from 0 to 9 or 10 I don&#039;t remember, with his family and his new mentor Roxy, and that&#039;s a good transition to talk about how the magic systemworks, Rudeus doesn&#039;t know shit about it neither the viewver, and we discover that system with him (1 point on imersiveness) it&#039;s pretty easy to grasp and isn&#039;t overly complicated but still interesting,<br />
<br />
And now we are following the adventures of his studies with Roxy and his new green haired elf friend named sylvie. <br />
Fast forward to the trip to the city even though we got a little affair bewteen zenith and that fuckboy paul but whatever. <br />
Rudeus goes to the city right of the bat he needs to deal with a little tsundere that doesn&#039;t want to study and is pretty violent. Rudeus then makes a plan to convince her that studying is important and sword isn&#039;t all that matter, but that plan goes pretty wrong pretty fast and they now need to get out withotut getting selled to malicious people. They managed to escape but get stuck in an alley when the bandits were prepared to kill them ghislaine the mentor of Iris and highly ranked sword master comes and what come after that is one of my favorite scenes of all fucking anime, THE scene that made me think &quot;Ok this is real&quot;,<br />
Ghislaine cut the bandits heads at lightning speed with no hesitation with insane sound and visuals. that scene made rudeus realize that he is not in the same world, people can kill with no hesitation and he is scared by that, that scene is craved onto rudeus memory forever and me too (another point on imersiveness). <br />
There is other really interesting things happening notably with Iris family but I&#039;m not gonna dive too deep on that. <br />
And then THE plot twist happens and it&#039;s litterally a /tp all it&#039;s so goddam simple and yet so goddam interesting, and we follow again rudeus and iris who teleported with him as well as a superd, a really REALLY powerful species but are known for being traitors because of a manipulative demon and thus begin the story of dead end which has for objective to get back home... I know pretty ironic, getting from town to town and meeting the families of both roxy and ghislaine. now I just wanna know, what happened to all the others characters, well we do know for some of them Roxy is searching for Rudeus when he is getting a demonic eye right next to her, Iris grandfather is fucking dead, but for the rest of them I just wanna know right fucking now<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s how you make a good worldbuilding/story where eveything makes sense and feels real and doesn&#039;t feel like everything is centered around the main character like in most anime and especially isekai<br />
<br />
About the characters, even if most of them are unlikeable as fuck, somehow I love them, and I think thats a incredible exploit to make me like those scumbags, I want to root for rudeus and Iris, I&#039;m attached to them even if the show does everything against that, can you think of any piece of media on the top of your head where you shoudn&#039;t root for the protagonist, personaly no, It goes straight up against the fundamentals of writing a story, it makes the show original and made me think, &quot;maybe Rudeus can change&quot; even if we&#039;re litteraly reminded at the start of each episode how much of a scumbag rudeus is, but not only him there are multiple charcters who do what they do only for their own benefit.<br />
<br />
 Now let&#039;s talk about studio bind and what those geniuses have done to make this show even better, First you can see that right of the bat but it&#039;s beautiful, the training fights look better than most anime fights out there and when rudeus uses a spell (the first water canon for example) its breathtaking, they really have a thing for getting impactful scenes to the next level, and did you notice that the anime seems a bit shaky and grainy, well it&#039;s on purpose and adds to the immersion and also the fact that THEY&#039;VE MADE ENTIRE LANGUAGES FOR THE ANIME but not just at the start and then translated, fully fledged unknown languages that when people speaks in that language its&#039; from begining to end, and let&#039;s talk about sound design, a different OP and ED every episode with that beatiful music, everything we hear is calculated perfeclty to make us dive in the stroy to never get back to the surface.l and studio bind has made an incredible job at making this show the most imersive show I&#039;ve ever seen<br />
<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it for this preliminary review I&#039;m probably gonna edit some parts in the future but yeah this is a masterpiece and go watch it

    **THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE**<br />
<br />
My opinion<br />
It&#039;s finally here the adventure of our young pervert. God knows how hyped I was when the season 2 was announced. I really liked the season 1 for the anime. And the main question does the season 2 match the level of season 1? It surely does. We get to see a lot of exciting things in the anime and some new reveals too. <br />
<br />
Story 8 <br />
Well no one disagrees that Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation had a new concept for the isekai. Well at least it was new for me. It&#039;s quite common to see people dying and reincarnating into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421927">
        another world. But we hardly get to see how did they grow up in the new world in detail. And Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation does it perfectly. Now taking it even further it&#039;s season 2 explores its world even more and I really like that thing. So in story I would give it an 8.<br />
<br />
Art 8 <br />
Studio Bind did a great job in animation for the anime. We get to see some cool visuals &amp; animation. And the art obviously was amazing. Honestly the detailing in some scenes were quite good. The fight scenes were well choreographed &amp; well animated. I would give it an 8 in art &amp; animation.<br />
<br />
Sound 7<br />
I am not quite the fan of the opening and ending of this anime. But they where the still fairly decent same goes with the OST&#039;s for this anime. But all the sounds blend perfectly with the theme of the anime. So, I would give it a 7. <br />
<br />
Characters 8 <br />
What good it is if an anime has a good story, good art style &amp; animations, decent sound tracks but lacks in character development. Well guess what Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation has a great character development &amp; a huge variety of old &amp; new characters. It shows us how can side characters be give fair enough screen time while not hampering the screen time of the main characters. So I would give it a solid 8 in characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9 <br />
After reading all this you might have a fair idea that this anime was really enjoyable for me and I wasn&#039;t bored while watching. Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation follows the lead of it&#039;s previous season while giving us a well balance between fan service &amp; a good storyline. So I would give it a 9.<br />
<br />
Overall 8 <br />
Well now to the conclusion. I really didn&#039;t found any major flaw for in this anime that could make it rated below 7 or 8. It was really a treat after the bunch of crap anime&#039;s of summer. I would give Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation an 8 overall.

    I usually don&#039;t write more than one preview per season, but this anime is SOO hyped that I have to break my rule. Mushoku is quickly becoming one of the most popular series on MAL. So why is this series so popular? I&#039;ll try break down some of the pros and cons.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
For an isekai series, Mushoku does invest fairly heavily in world building. Compared to the average isekai, it&#039;s pretty impressive that Mushoku created countries, noble houses, a little bit of history, and even hired a linguistics graduate to create a fantasy language. That happens pretty often in the West ever since Tolkien blazed that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422627">
        trail. Klingon was created in the 1960s and is a full language with fleshed out vocabulary and grammar rules. Same goes with Dothraki and even Na&#039;vi from Avatar. However, that really doesn&#039;t happen much in anime. Garzey&#039;s Wing attempted it to disastrous results. So kudos for Mushoku.<br />
<br />
The animation and OST are actually pretty darn good. I really have no complaints on a technical level. Mushoku was a very successful light novel series in Japan, so this anime received a generous budget. They didn&#039;t have to worry about this making money with Japanese otaku. Mushoku is going to run another 5 seasons at least.<br />
<br />
Mushoku actually cares about its magic system. Us geeky anime fans love to know how stuff works. How much energy and experience is needed for a certain spell. What is the spell&#039;s recharge time? What is the effective range? How does magic work in this world and where does it come from? Can anyone learn magic? This is why fans will constantly bug people like Akira Toriyama and Hirohiko Araki with these sorts of questions and those 2 will usually respond with &quot;I don&#039;t remember, I was drunk when I wrote that shit. Why do you even care? It was funny!&quot; The author of Mushoku cares and he&#039;s happy for you to ask all the questions you want.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
Whether or not you like a character is entirely subjective. However, I will say I greatly dislike the MC in this series. It&#039;s not just that he&#039;s a bad person. There are plenty of characters who do horrible things and yet are compelling and interesting characters. A great character doesn&#039;t need to be some goody two-shoes who is immediately loveable. The issue is that Mushoku presents itself like a redemption story and it honestly isn&#039;t. In life, Rudeus was a loathsome piece of shit who would rather fap to loli porn than go to his own parents&#039; funeral. However, he gets a second chance at life and vows to become a better person. He uses his adult knowledge and formal education to completely outpace his peers, learn the fantasy language by 2, and become a powerful mage. However, he&#039;s still a pedophilic degenerate who makes no effort to improve morally. He isn&#039;t a latent pedophile who struggles against his body&#039;s natural desires and feels tremendous guilt. That would actually be interesting. Instead, he grooms and bangs all the girls in the novel series because he&#039;s a power fantasy for the male readers. He doesn&#039;t improve and there are no negative consequences for his actions. Ever. <br />
<br />
Halfway through season 1, the God of the Mushoku universe comes to Rudeus and starts telling him what he needs to do to advance to the next part of the story. Whenever Rudeus is stuck, we get literal deus ex machina to save the day and keep the plot moving. In the first episode of season 2, Rudeus needs a power up. So God tells him to buy some food and give it to an obnoxious loli begging in an alley. It turns out she is actually a bratty demon lord and knockoff Disgaea character who rewards Rudeus with the Sharingan from Naruto. Now that Rudeus got a free power up, he can instantly defeat Eris and completely undermine all of her training. This is necessary though because he needs to be the alpha if he&#039;s going to groom and bang her. Which he will. I&#039;m going to come out and say it. The plot of Mushoku is pretty bad. The fact this is a novel series is embarrassing. There are plenty of 1990s JRPGs that are better written than this. <br />
<br />
This is another subjective factor, but I have no love for either the comedy or echii content in this series. The English dub at least tried to improve the comedy, but when I watch it subbed I don&#039;t even smile once per episode. I am a very easy person to make laugh. I laughed at Peter Grill at least twice an episode and those are 10 minute episodes. This anime is comedically getting its ass kicked by Peter Grill. It also entirely fails to titillate or arouse me, since almost all the fanservice is from loli characters. I&#039;d rather masturbate to the characters in Plus Sized Elf than this garbage. <br />
<br />
I gave this a 4 purely for technical reasons. I like to have at least a little objectivity in my ratings. However, I can honestly say that I&#039;d rather be watching Goblin Slayer season 2. I had a lot more fun with Redo of Healer. I&#039;ve already alluded to the fact that on an enjoyment level, I think Peter Grill is better than Mushoku. If I didn&#039;t have horrendous anime taste myself, it would physically hurt me to see a series this mediocre get so hyped. So no, I don&#039;t recommend watching Mushoku. If you have to see what the hype is all about, I would at least wait for the dub to come out. <br />

    Mushoku Tensei is amazing but certainly is not for everybody. Having already read the light novels and web novels I am very impressed with how they are handling the adaptation and the direction in which they are taking it. Certainly, it is not perfect, but there is much to be commended.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story of Mushoku Tensei is nearly perfect, as it is very interesting to see how what was a worthless piece of trash decided to live in this world and use their second chance. What I find to be great, but a little lackluster in some moments is the pacing, most of the time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421941">
        the anime makes sure to spend time fleshing out the story and events, but sometimes things that should have taken longer feel like they flash by in an instant, this isn&#039;t much of a problem though as it is only apparent in some episodes. It is really interesting to see the background of the world and how it is built, all of the issues and moral injustices that may be reflecting Rudeus&#039; personality and acting as the catalyst for his character progression. The different situations in which Rudeus finds himself are all relevant to his character growth and they all cause some sort of conflict (either internal or external) which is great to see. The comedy is also really appealing to me, and I find myself audibly laughing to most of the jokes or out of pure excitement of what has been created, something I really rarely do otherwise. What makes this even better, is how suddenly the mood shifts, contrasting the much more positive outlook Rudeus has on this world than it actually is.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The art is phenomenal, no complaints there. Every single location feels alive, and the character designs are also slowly progressing to look older, a really great detail. The art greatly accentuates the awesome worldbuilding in Mushoku Tensei and makes it much more interesting to see. The fight scenes are fluid and pleasing and are usually well choreographed. I personally like seeing the different fighting styles of the different types of swordsmen and how they overcome their opponents. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Everything about the sound in this anime is great, the OST is really good and it makes for a great viewing experience. Usually I skip both the beginning and end of most of the stuff I watch, but for Mushoku Tensei I watch the whole thing through which says a lot.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
Each character in MT is unique and entertaining to unravel and observe, the progression of the characters also makes perfect sense and does not pose any problems. Rudeus is most interesting to watch as he slowly grows and begins to develop throughout the series, beginning to understand that this is a real world in which he lives with real people, not just NPC&#039;s. His actions affect those around him in negative ways, and he tries to change himself to counteract that. All of the cast of Mushoku Tensei is entertaining in my opinion, and I&#039;ve grown to root for some aspects of the characters to improve, which makes it all the better to see when they actually change in the direction which I want them to.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
Mushoku Tensei is what I would consider being perhaps the best Isekai, but it is certainly not for those who are looking for something lighthearted or even looking for the main character to be the epitome of perfection. It starts off rough, but slowly you grow to appreciate parts of it as it grows into something more complex. The art is spectacular and there are no moments of awful CGI that will ruin scenes. The sound is perfect, and fits the anime really well. And if you enjoyed Season 1, then I am sure you will find Season 2 even more enjoyable.

    Mushoku Tensei is everything you have ever wanted an isekai to be. The story is great and I&#039;ve heard we&#039;re still only at the introduction phase. The animation makes me cry because it&#039;s so nice. The soundtrack is simply beautiful. The immersion I feel when watching this anime is unmatched. The 20-minute episodes feel like 5. If you do not want to watch this anime because of Rudeus, just remember that this is a redemption story. We follow Rudy in his attempts at being a better person in this new life. &quot;I will seriously try if I go to another world.&quot;-Rudy probably idk. Just watch

    I&#039;ve been waiting for the 2nd part of Mushoku Tensei, one of my favorite Isekai anime for months. I had high expectations for the second part as I liked the first part so much. We&#039;re almost halfway through the part so far.<br />
<br />
The story continues to be as simple as in the first season, but in a fun way. I can say that I liked the part before it got even better. One of the biggest reasons is that a good Studio does this.<br />
<br />
I can say that the characters are slowly starting to develop. the art and sound are great as always. In short, although not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421952">

    Wow, the world building in this Anime... really is something else. I&#039;m really not sure at this point, why this was conceived of as an Isekai. Frankly it feels too good for that.<br />

There is so much world building going on at such a high level of quality and subtelty, that there isn&#039;t an OP in this Anime anymore. Where the OP used to be is now just like, two full minutes of the Anime running in the background without any voiced dialogue when characters interact with each other, set to different music each time. Then they splash the title, and turn on the other sounds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422109">
        - that&#039;s how episodes start now. Just that alone, I would be writing strong praise over. It works, it&#039;s different, and it sets the tone to appreciate each episode by communicating a feeling of it before it even starts and providing information about the setting and the stage of the journey.<br />
<br />
But there&#039;s more! The production values have gone up yet again. Pacing is better still, and it was already incredibly good to see a show finally have the patience to pace itself so consistently. Major events transpire almost under the radar, and the overarching journey has become quite interesting with herculean efforts like restoring the reputation of the superd and the question of what they will find when they reach their destination, and what the origin of the disaster that sent Rudeus and Eris to the other side of the world was, looming ahead. As each of our main trio rub off on one another in believable fashion, they experience character development that feels authentic - there is a resistance to change, there are arguments, there are compromises and comraderie has set in but not completely. The creeper undertones have gone down at least like, 3-4 notches. We have identifiable and formidable foes, near-fatal misunderstandings, and the handicap of travelling with a Superd companion - big steps up in the adversary and challenges department. With the exception of some funky hax`z being inserted into the plot via the isekai angle, the purpose of the isekai angle has been reduced to a convenient way to do narration without breaking viewer immersion or requiring stuipd expository dialogue between the characters themselves - and it does work in that capacity.<br />
<br />
So, that&#039;s a lot of good things happening for only four episodes into the second cour here. Another thing I can say, is that similar to the welcome reimagining of the OP as a an appertif or palette cleanser, preparing us to digest the episode, the tropes that are used here are creatively applied. They have an artistic flair and creativity to their presentation that prevents or at least helps to dampen the instinctive eye-roll... overall, the second cour has been smooth. as. butter.<br />
<br />
Eris becomes a tolerable character that makes sense, though she was getting there in the first cour it&#039;s now final. The Superd &quot;dead end&quot; is a welcome addition, he makes sense as well. His quiet, steadfast demeanour and apparently unwavering values belie some complexity - turns out, he will let one or two things go for the right reason, and he had some ambitions back in the day. There is more to him by the 4th episode here than there was when he was first introduced.<br />
<br />
Rudeus is still a big gross pedo, though. Just thought you should know that, otherwise would rate 10/10.<br />
<br />

    Mushoku Tensei probably be the best anime of the year, or at least best fantasy / Isekai for recent years.<br />
<br />
The story taking part after the mana incident that separate Rudeus, Eris, and Ghislaine. Making their back accompanied by Ruijerd, they face many challenges on their way back accompanying Eris back to their family. To be said, all the conflict that they get involved into feels not rushed or suddenly happened, but the conflict happened naturally as they travel back to Asura Kingdom or to be precise Eris hometown.<br />
<br />
Art on the both animation and the ending theme also fascinating to see, the feel of the animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422631">
        seems fluid, natural, and not exaggerated by any means.<br />
<br />
Character development also pictured really great, the changes of the main characters, namely the Dead End party can all be seen clearly that Rudeus, Eris, and Ruijerd as the member of Dead End have been change in some ways since the characters are introduced back in the season 1, and the changes is also not rushed, it feel natural as well and come up without realized directly by the audiences. Rudeus in one episode mentioned about this directly, strengthen the argument that they have been changes.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, Mushoku Tensei is really enjoyable anime to watch and really good ride in the leisure time despite there are some episodes or scene that likely hated by most people. However, if we ignore that fact, Mushoku Tensei is really great show to enjoy.

    I am loving this anime.<br />
Specifically, the English Dub.<br />
<br />
The sub version is nice, but here I&#039;m experiencing the opposite of the issue that most dubs suffer from. Usually, the dub sounds phoned-in. But that&#039;s DEFINITELY not the case in this anime!<br />
<br />
Sadly, only S1 is dubbed so far, but I cannot recommend the dub enough if you&#039;re a native English speaker!<br />
<br />
The voice acting is 20/10 god-tier, and the writing is INCREDIBLE.<br />
After comparing the dub with the sub, the subtitles just convey the bare-minimum. Flowing from one sentence of info to the next.<br />
While the dub has so much emotion and realistic inflection behind it!<br />
The acting for the voices

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422110">
        (specifically, the main character) makes you feel like the MC is actually a real person walking you through what he&#039;s thinking and feeling.<br />
<br />
If I could rate this 15 or 20 out of 10, I absolutely would!

1. I have never seen better storytelling than Mushoku has. Story is good because there is not much happening so far, not some big deals at least, but the way they gide you through it, is what really shines. Humor here is not that imoral as in first part, so thats a plus. <br />
2. Art. I will not spend much time here and just tell you that art is top tier awesomeness<br />
3. Sound, don&#039;t get me wrong, openings are very awesome, but I really think they could do better job with sound in specific scenes and bring out the epicness even more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423109">
        for fight particular. If you are fun of openings, you are free to enjoy, these are great.<br />
4. Characters did visibly some mental progress and it&#039;s very enjoyable to see that. It is not very often when you see characters that feels like a real human being and it&#039;s very easy to relate what brigs the enjoyment high up to the sky.<br />
<br />
Overall this is must watch anime. I recommend it and it&#039;s highly enjoyable anime. Also I recommend some glass of vine to it.<br />

    1st season was good but this 2nd season is even better..<br />
You can skip below part its copied because of longer review req.<br />
<br />
Mushoku tensei is great, probably even the best anime of this year<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean c&#039;mon mushoku tensei is So good that you don&#039;t even have to be a isekai fan to love it<br />
<br />
Gorgeous Art i mean real beautiful , most of this can be used as 4K art assets for AAA video games , Mushoku tensei doesn&#039;t stop giving us new desktop screensavers in every freaking frame. Animations in battles are crisp and almost no recognizable 3D is ever on screen due to clever camera

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423709">
        placement .<br />
<br />
Great characters , each easily Distinguishable, the Girls are not in the anime just be waifus and are actual people (and waifus) ,Rudy the main Focus , is a complex and flawed character who you aren&#039;t supposed to like (actually you pity the guy more often than not)but sometimes he can be a real bro .<br />
<br />
The music is easily so creative it is an all time classic like bebop or champloo. It sets the atmosphere so well. Upbeat but still medieval,the kind that made us admire the unskippable opening since it is also filled with additional Art .VA is well done the switching between old rudy and young rudy is done so well that even tho they are distinctly different we always know they are the same person the other characters have great established seiyuus as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story is where mushoku tensei really excels it goes to different tangents from a very simple premise without making it feel odd the main goal of MC was not decided at reincarnation like IMMA DEFEAT DEMON LORD or anything its always been down to earth like , I just gotta earn money for my best friends sylphy’s tuition , i gotta help eris get home , it&#039;s my responsibility as her teacher and most importantly I just need to live my life properly and without regrets (that is basically the full title of this anime).<br />
<br />
<br />
Mushoku Tensei is truly a benchmark good Isekai anime. Hell, I believe it Should BE THE BENCHMARK anime due to the sheer potential it has in all forms: beautiful Art, immersive story, well written characters . its a modern masterpiece and I am glad that the studio incharge seems equally as passionate as we fans are for this adaptation.<br />
<br />
the main concern is pedophilia.....<br />
<br />
1)He may look like an ugly bastard straight out of hentai in his previous life but there is more to Rudy than meets the eye. Rudy is fundamentally a 17-year-old kid at the start of the anime. Yes I know he is physically 37 but a thing or two about his MENTAL GROWTH: His growth stopped exactly at the point when he refused to communicate work or even interact with society in any tangible form (look up Genie, the feral child in google if you wish to know what happens to people who totally disconnect), yes one might say he still had his computer and all that but would I really call that mental Growth? I&#039;ll call it mental deterioration, learning all sorts of nefarious things that the internet has plenty of. Even if he got any good advice from his parents or the internet he won&#039;t take it since he feels “this is only a trap to make him go back outside”, hence he is just a 17-year-old boy with nothing for a moral compass except whatever his broken brain approves of (including pedophilia) and a loose understanding the laws of civilized society (through his education till highschool and online experiences).<br />
<br />
2)Main character in an isekai must be A kirito clone or an Edgelord<br />
Rudy makes several mistakes all the time he tries to make things right , but fails . tries to find an easy way out , fails . Thinks he can just use talk no jutsu against criminals , and fails again. The Thing is he is so broken he still believes that the GALGAME simulation self that he tries the create is the best solution and in a way is still failing to accept that this is his new reality and the consequences are real and the death flag is NOT A RESET POINT anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)MC must be a badass ice-cold killer who kills enemies like flies<br />
He still is unable to because well it&#039;s too violent and raw for someone who has led a peaceful like Him he may have great power but he has yet to cross the line. Moreover, someone who has always been meek and submissive his entire life cannot easily come to terms with such a deed, THE DUDE WAS A BYSTANDER IN HIS OWN LIFE how can we expect him to act on such an ordeal.<br />

    I&#039;m not sure what use a review of season 2 is, to be honest. If you watched 1, you will watch 2 regardless of what you read here. You also already know the general setting and theme, and don&#039;t really want spoilers for the specifics of events in the episodes to come. So what&#039;s left to write about?<br />
<br />
Well, what I personally want to write about is something that surprised me as I started watching this season. You see, I&#039;ve already read the manga a while ago, and last season did not seem to me to be particularly different from what I remembered. But this time,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423065">
        it was night and day. A lot of details have been added or changed - starting small but noticeable from the very first minute and growing to an extent I&#039;m still having trouble processing as the episodes go on. Some are insignificant things, like the number of kids held captive in one story. Others maybe a bit more questionable and likely meant to provoke controversy and publicity for the show - i.e. introducing a certain super slut character much earlier and in a more &quot;hands on&quot; way than in the manga, or someone&#039;s murder in front of MC&#039;s eyes that did not occur in the manga, etc. I don&#039;t agree all changes are for the better - there&#039;s a change in a &quot;boss fight&quot; that honestly made more sense in its manga version to me - but that&#039;s still subjective. There is even an entirely new mini arc introducing brand new characters and revealing some of Ghislaine&#039;s background that was completely missing in the manga. And the surprises just keep coming: though it falls in with the story of the manga eventually, an important arc from episode 5 begins in a completely different way, and has a much cooler fight scene to boot.<br />
<br />
I am definitely excited about what&#039;s to come. And this makes me wonder if season 1 was also so different and I just did not pay attention or remember enough to spot it...<br />
<br />
If these changes come from the novels - I don&#039;t know for sure - I guess novel readers would laugh at me for being excited about &quot;old news&quot;. But if you are a manga reader, and you are thinking of skipping this because you already know what&#039;s what, think again.

    :o this anime is good. Ngl but you must watch it, the second season is as good as the first season. The story is great even though that there is already so many isekai themed anime. I would pick this as the best Isekai anime now beside &quot;That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime&quot;. The character development is good and detailed. I haven&#039;t read the manga and probably won&#039;t read it because I&#039;m an anime enjoyer :D and now the anime seems shown detailed for every pre-arc, main-arc, and post-arc which can be concluded that there is no skipping on the manga. Well, overall

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423205">
        It&#039;s a good anime. I could say It&#039;s a masterpiece due to Its unique MC act and good storyline :v.

    I dont like to judge a work early, but I dont expect this to become outdated by the 12th episode, and thus (Also please dont hate parade me, I&#039;ll just delete it anyway, thankies) :<br />
<br />
Pacing, animation, voiceacting and even lots of deeper themes are superb, in many cases top of the industry, so why the low rating? Simply: Im sick of the Mc being a pedo. Yes, yes I lambasted critcques of the previous season for &quot;not getting it&quot;, but tbh, it doesnt seem like the author does either, the pace at which this &quot;redemption&quot; takes place seems to be slower than a fairytale love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422036">
        triagle, meaning it slowly inces and teases towards the slightest hint of progress over hours and hours of screentime, only to be completly rolled back under a comedic pretense, I am sick of it and am geniunly questioning the underlying motivations of this story at this point, cause incompetence to do better can be excluded through this work&#039;s more impressive aspects.<br />
Argh, I really wanna like this show. Heres a prayer to this being irrelevant by the end of the season<br />
Here&#039;s the obligatory section breakdown <br />
Story:____9<br />
Art:______10<br />
Sound:___ 10<br />
Character:_8<br />
Enjoyment:3<br />
Overall :__ 4<br />

    I never thought I could enjoy a show that has a score of 0 for character (probably deserves less), but Mushoku Tensei somehow makes it possible. It&#039;s an isekai where a horny outcast gets transformed into the most OP kid ever, but still has the self esteem of his past self. To say the least, every character has some....atoning to consider. There are parts that seem a bit overdone, if not outright a  turnoff; it almost seems like a rejected hentai plot.<br />
<br />
That said if you can handle the random moans or suppressed virgin energy this show does have a plot and flawed, but realistic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422965">
        characters. It&#039;s a coming of age show where you can rewrite your past...present..and future? Except sometimes, history rewrites itself for a reason. It might not be me, it&#039;s probably you Rudy. In most cases, this type of show would be a lost cause, but given the direction, the art, the music, and of course the talented seiyuus-- this is one of those shows that somehow keeps bringing you back. You can hate it, but you can&#039;t really say it wasn&#039;t well done given all the source it was provided; truthfully I&#039;d argue the second season is even better then the first.<br />
 <br />
It&#039;s not quite the formula for your traditional isekai (although a lot of the Fall/Winter21 isekais seem to have reworked their formula from this show).

    No spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
What was Mushoku Tensei, season 1? An overall high budget, and great adaptation of what&#039;s actually pretty bad or perhaps mediocre base material.<br />
<br />
What is this season 2 then? A slightly lower budget BAD adaptation of said story. At the time of writing this i&#039;ve only reached episode 4, but let me tell ya&#039;, if this trend keeps on, this will end up being a pretty big flop as far as i see it (5.4~ or so so far), as opposed to the previous season (7~/10).<br />
<br />
What exactly is the reasoning behind me saying all this? Rushing, cutting, replacements, all done in almost the worst

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422091">
        ways possible. All the interesting events? Almost entirely removed. Half the LN&#039;s MAIN STORY events? Gone and replaced with something either from the web novel or entirely made up. Which you may say might be necessary if they&#039;re trying to focus more on the more important and interesting events, rush stuff to get to a better place... But they&#039;re NOT! More than that, all the time they free up with speeding up the events that way they use up on less interesting and less important side events and characters, meaning they make everything dull without actually creating too much interest, and it lasted for pretty much FOUR EPISODES so far!<br />
<br />
And its not just me knowing the LN, again, i kind of liked what they did for the last season. So yeah, here&#039;s hoping for the best but so far, this season is quite dreadful.

    Absolute masterpiece man, just about everything you&#039;d want in a Isekai but refined to be just perfect.<br />
<br />
I value worldbuilding above all in any entertainment medium I consume and this so far has been checking those boxes off quite nicely.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it was intentional or not but every time the party enters a new town instead of having a generic OP play at the start of each episode we are instead treated to a unique and pleasant song while being shown the new environment which gives me some serious game vibes of arriving in a new town and having the sights and sounds change as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423758">
        you&#039;d expect them to.<br />
<br />
Little details like this elevate what is already the purest refinement of the Isekai genre and in my opinion give it at least a 9/10 in my book.<br />
<br />
I rarely read light novels since I prefer visual/audio elements in my entertainment [which is why I love VN&#039;s] but this may be the only series besides Spice &amp; Wolf that I go out of my way to read the entire LN.

    Giving the first 4 episodes of this series a 6, which is painful, especially as the hole the studio dug for themselves is because of their own meddling with the writing of the original Light Novel.<br />
<br />
I will not go into details, but the first &quot;arc&quot; in this season had the animation studio taking numerous liberties with the storylines, story reveal timings, characters and plotlines. Things that didn&#039;t happen in the novel happened, things that happened in the novel didn&#039;t and were completely messed up. The characters and their relationships were also hurt, weakening the character writing that was present in the 1st season (because the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422184">
        1st season mostly followed the novel)<br />
<br />
The episodes may still be seen as &quot;decent&quot; or even &quot;good&quot; for people who haven&#039;t read the light novel, maybe you think that the storylines still played out well, but knowing the potential of the story, and seeing a mediocre use of it, just feels bad. They took a perfectly cooked filet mignon, threw that in the trash, and used a frozen slab of meat instead (still has good seasoning, but it&#039;s a crazy waste).<br />
<br />
The action feels cheaper compared to the first season, there isn&#039;t as much detail, sharpness or depth to the character moves. It feels like it uses a lot more blurring of moves/characters, the moves don&#039;t translate well into proper sword moves/stances. The action screams &quot;budget restraints&quot;, but no clue if that&#039;s actually the reality.<br />
<br />
I will adjust this rating based on the following episodes, but currently, I&#039;d recommend reading the light novel and just skipping this season based on what I&#039;ve seen thus far. It&#039;s a 6/10 season, you can watch it, like the bones of the source material, but I still think it will hurt your overall experience of the original story.
