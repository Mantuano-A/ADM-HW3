    Let me begin by saying I&#039;ve been waiting for this movie for a little more than 4 months, so although there is bound to be some bias in this review I will try to keep it as balanced as possible and write as if the anticipation was less. I will also try my best to include as little spoilers as possible, but if you have yet watched the trailer, you might get spoiled in the smaller parts<br />
<br />
Plot - 10/10<br />
As you might have read in the synopsis, Josee met Tsuneo by a chance encounter (check out trailer if you want to know what happened) and decides

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396023">
        that despite her disabilities, she wants to see the outside world. If you have seen the trailer beforehand, you will know that both of them sneaked out when her grandmother took her naps, and they explored the world Josee had never seen or had not seen for quite a long time. It was during those times that she experienced more of the outside world, an experience that she found very exciting and scary at the same time.<br />
<br />
I think the best part of the movie was when everything goes wrong, one after another. I know there is bound to be people who say something along the lines of &quot;oh, but the climax was cliché&quot; and I won&#039;t say they are wrong. But the way it is depicted in this tale is not very usual, and some scenes forces you to try sympathize with the characters due to how heartbreaking the implications and the events can get. Also, I can safely say that this is the only movie in which the storytelling of a children&#039;s book can be phrased in a way that makes the audience very emotional, so look forward to that.<br />
<br />
Art - 9/10<br />
The art in this movie is average at best. If you have seen Garden of Words or Your Name, then you might feel that the art in this movie is mediocre. This is where I disagree. The art serves as a support for the plot that we are paying our money for, and the art in this movie actually supports the plot well. You will not find yourself feeling left out by the characters who look so unrealistic that they seem to be of a different world. In fact, you might actually be drawn to the characters because the art makes them feel real, and the fact that a simplistic art style makes it feel realistic is a selling point of a movie.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10/10<br />
Now many people might be reviewing this based on the ending song Ao no Waltz by Eve since the Eve music video in Youtube had been very popular before the movie&#039;s release and had been the reason why many people watched the movie in the first place. While that song itself was good, we can&#039;t discount the fact that you only get to hear that during the last few minutes of the movie. So instead I will share about the ambient sounds and the speech patterns of characters in the movie.<br />
<br />
The sounds in the movie are engineered in a manner that will leave you breathless. Some scenes include a lot of atmospheric noises which will improve the already realistic feel of the movie, while others uses the strength of silence to emphasize the feelings each character holds true within themselves. The way each characters spoke really reflects what is actually on their minds, rather than the words they actually used and the message they actually tried to deliver.<br />
<br />
Character - 9/10<br />
In terms of character development, I feel that it was done in a rushed manner and although it explains every character, their personalities, and their behaviors well, it does not give you time to process the string of information. However, I can’t say that it was done in a bad manner, it isn&#039;t. The main goal of this rapid development is actually to let you immerse yourself in their world and experience and understand more about the characters with the characters themselves. Confused?<br />
<br />
Let me give you a rundown of my argument. Would you find watching a movie which tells everything you need to know about a character or one that makes you go in the same pace as the characters? I think the fact that we do not know everything about a character is realistic in the sense that, in the real world, we do not know everything about people we interact with, and instead only know what had been displayed by that person.<br />
<br />
As for the characters themselves, there is not many to talk about, but there is much to talk about them, but I won&#039;t, you have to see for yourselves. There are some you hate but will grow on you, some you enjoy looking at, and some you might loath so much because of how rigid their minds work. It is this good blend that reflects how the real world actually is, and that’s how the movie makes its characters so relatable and not flat.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10/10<br />
Won&#039;t go into too much details here since I&#039;ve been waiting for this movie and it’s only natural that I will enjoy myself. However, in the theatres I was watching at, people cheered at the end of the movie so I guess it was enjoyable enough even if you watched it without any background information.<br />
<br />
Overall - 10/10<br />
Summary of this review, it&#039;s worth it to watch. Give it a shot.

    I watched this in theater recently and decided to write a review, will keep it simple for those who&#039;s curious about this movie.<br />
<br />
In summary, this romance drama is pretty standard as it goes, so if you expect something new or something compelling then you won&#039;t find it here. Animated movie formats in general are fast paced due to its short run time; relying on common tropes, character archetypes and melodrama to convey the story quickly and efficiently; it simply can&#039;t be fleshed out like a TV-series, and this movie is no different. Of course, this isn&#039;t a bad thing - what I want to address

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392676">
        here is to know your expectations before watching this (and pretty much anything else). I personally watched this because I want a light-hearted casual show with nice interactions between the main duo. And yes it is a cute show which satisfied my needs, so if you watch the trailer and like what it has to offer then you should definitely give it a chance. Next up are my personal thoughts of this movie with no spoilers.<br />
<br />
The main duo Josee and Tsuneo got to know each other during an accidental encounter. Tsuneo, as a poor college student, was offered a job right after by Josee&#039;s grandmother - it is to look after Josee and keep her safe from the outside world due to her condition. It wasn&#039;t easy for Tsuneo to earn the trust of a wary and awkward Josee who&#039;s confined from the outside world most of the time, but eventually he got through. And from there Tsuneo slowly helped Josee to see the world that she always wished to see; became more independent and overcome her physical condition that greatly hindered her life. You should be able to guess how the rest goes.<br />
<br />
The movie doesn&#039;t waste time elaborating, it set up the story and the arcs quickly and efficiently. You will feel the quick pacing of the film (due to the format&#039;s limitation like I mentioned at the start), but it isn&#039;t feel rushed. The first half introduced our characters and established the duo&#039;s dynamic, and then it shifted gears right away into the second half where the drama starts surfacing. The general flow of the movie was decent from start to finish - exciting and cute at first, then it gets heavier during the drama act, goosebump during the climax and lighthearted in the end with a happy ending. I was pleased with the movie&#039;s general execution, although the first act where it established the duo&#039;s dynamic was kinda short in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Tsuneo and Josee are classic characters you usually see in a romance drama, but what matters is the execution, and it was well done. Tsuneo is a hardworking college student who loves ocean life and want it to be his career goal. While Josee dreams of exploring the outside world, especially the sea. She loves drawing and her topic has always been about the world under the water. It is the love of the sea that draws these two together, and from here we see their relationship started to develop. Tsuneo is level-headed, matured and responsible; while Josee is a bit hot-tempered, and awkward due to lack of interaction with the outside world (which her overprotective grandmother played a big part in). But as she grew more comfortable around Tsuneo, she became expressive, happy, easily excited (and sometimes embarrassed) over the most mundane things of the outside world and it especially peaked when she saw the sea. It melted me a bit seeing these sides of Josee. During the second half we will see how the duo helped each other to overcome their struggles and life misfortunes. I won&#039;t dwell too much into this, but it was well paced and ended on a good note like I mentioned last paragraph. <br />
<br />
The relationship dynamic between Tsuneo and Josee for the most part can be described as cute and light-hearted. Their interactions and dialogues remind me of Korean romance for some reason - short remarks; bashfulness between the two, especially from Josee as she became fond of Tsuneo, but for the most part, light-hearted and pleasant. Their voice acting are on point as well. There&#039;s only one gripe I had - I wished there was more development and connection between the two as they talk about their love for the sea because I love sea themes in general and unfortunately the movie doesn&#039;t cover this too much, which was a bummer. <br />
<br />
The supporting cast are nothing special. They serve only as plot device, nothing more, nothing less. There&#039;s a love triangle but it existed only to move the story forward and the melodrama was rather awkward but ultimately it served its purpose and wasn&#039;t dragged out, which was a relief. Moving on.<br />
<br />
Art, music &amp; general direction was nice. You can check out Eve&#039;s MV Aono waltz to have a feel of everything. Unfortunately, 90% of the eye candy visuals and the most beautiful shots are all in that 4-minute MV so you won&#039;t find much more in the movie. Don&#039;t expect it to be stunning every frame like Makoto Shinkai&#039;s productions.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is an enjoyable show and I had a good time watching it. Hopefully this review will help you make up your mind and have a casual, realistic view of what this movie is like.

<br />
Josee, the Tiger and the Fish is a movie that tells a story heavily focused on Josee (the disabled girl shown on the poster) and Tsuneo (the boy who walks besides Josee shown on the poster). When you saw this movie&#039;s poster for the first time, you might be thinking that this movie will tell one hell of a sad story. You&#039;re not wrong, but you&#039;re not completely right either if you think like that. My suggestion if you ever wanted to watch this movie, do not take your expectations too highly. I&#039;ve heard a lot of positive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399196">
        things about this movie before, and that obviously made me expecting things highly from this movie. The movie did not live up to my expectations, but it did have it&#039;s own redeemable quality to be called &quot;good&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s get to the review: <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
The story is as generic drama as it could get. As I&#039;ve mentioned as an opening before, this movie is heavily focused on Tsuneo and Josee. Why did I say it&#039;s generic? Because this kind of story has been seen and used lot in the drama romance genre.<br />
<br />
[This is a paragraph worth of recap of the plot. You can skip it]<br />
It&#039;s a story about Josee who has a deficiency locked up by her overprotective grandma in her own house for too long, and that made her has a dream to see the outside world by herself. Tsuneo on the other hand, is a &quot;normal&quot; boy who has a part-time job that needed him to explore the ocean and has a dream to become a student in a foreign university. One night, Tsuneo came across Josee by accident and that somehow made Tsuneo became closer to her. Their journey exploring the outside begins there, and guess what? Yes, they slowly grow a feeling into each other.<br />
<br />
Okay, the main problem is not how the story is oftenly seen on the screen, but it&#039;s the way how the movie tells the story. There&#039;s no proper explanations on how and why these things on the screen happening. Things just happens like that, and it tricks you into thinking the movie has explained the important parts when it&#039;s actually not. I sat there watching confused with a question like &quot;How? Why?&quot; most of the time. Being &quot;mainstream&quot; is not enough to call this kind of story generic, but looking at how lacking the storytelling is kind of backing my statement about it being generic. The pacing on the other hand, is kind of balanced in a way even if it feels a bit forced sometimes. The flow from the happy introduction, to melancholic complication, then going back to the happy vibes in the end feels nice and balanced. As I said, Nothing bad, nothing good. <br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: 9/10<br />
Probably the best aspect of the movie. The artstyle is absolutely smooth and detailed, it made my eyes almost reached the orgasmic point. Animation is also feels and looks smooth. I&#039;m sure this alone could make you hooked into watching the movie more. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The voice acting is very good. The dialect that Josee spoke feels natural, and every other voice acting of the characters here is also feels natural, even the screams could make some goosebumps here and there. The sfx is nice, and then the music. Eve takes part in this, and boi it did make the show better. I almost shed a tear when Eve&#039;s music starts to play in the middle of the movie as it fits perfectly with the scene that the song placed in. <br />
<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
Even though the movie is heavily focused on Josee and Tsuneo, they both did not have a proper background, but I&#039;d say it&#039;s still tolerable. Their backgrounds might be little, but their journey on the movie could make the viewer cares about them. <br />
The other characters though? They seem to be exist only to be a plot device. No proper backgrounds and not enough screentime to make the viewer at least lay an eye on them. There&#039;s one scene that made me scratched my head out of confusion. One character that is supposed to be an important character, just got removed without an explanation. Imagine one neutral scene where you&#039;re not supposed to expect something, the show gave you a sudden turn anyway. It&#039;s not a shock value, but it&#039;s still something. Something to confuse the hell out of your mind. The scene is supposed to be &quot;powerful&quot; but it&#039;s just, they don&#039;t seem to even care with the characters other than Josee and Tsuneo. Also, the whole &quot;love rival&quot; just came out of nowhere, and the show expects the viewer to care about it?. I mean, again, because there is no proper explanation on it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
Even though this movie did confuse the heck out of me, and dissapointed me since i had high expectations on it, it somehow still made me almost sheds a tear. And that artstyle, my eyes highly appreciates it. Also, Josee&#039;s cute not gonna lie.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.6 - (7: Good)<br />
tl;dr - This is a heartwarming and cute movie. Best watched with your close ones and enjoys it together. Even if this would made the viewer confused with it&#039;s way of storytelling, but it could still make the viewer cares about the two main duo of the movie, as it is their focus of the show. It&#039;s a good watch overall even tho there&#039;s a lot of downs from the movie.<br />
<br />
And yes, i&#039;m sorry if this looks like a rant rather than a review.

    &quot;Grandma, the outside is not scary at all.&quot;<br />

Josee, the Tiger and the Fish may have had a slightly bumpy start, but it knows its own strengths and uses it to build its momentum. At its apex, this film shines in all its beauty and fills you up with all sorts of emotions. What you will witness from this anime is the clear result of a passionate team that knows how to delicately craft a story that is able to stand out among the crowd of modern anime.<br />
<br />
Josee&#039;s story contains several tropes, including cliche ones, but it is able to execute them when time is appropriate

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402401">
        and the result is of praise. The main characters, Josee and Tsuneo, got to meet each other through a coincidence, which is nothing special but certainly not bad. Their relationship went off to a rocky beginning, however, when both of them realized their similar interest for the ocean, it kicked off the steady climb in terms of their understanding of each other. That is great and all, but it was not yet what I was looking for. Josee always had a love for drawing of the ocean and fishes. She even dreams of her swimming as a mermaid in an underwater world with fishes. The part of the story that heavily stuck out to me was the scene where Josee reads a storybook to the children. Every page of the storybook was painted by Josee; every page of the storybook encapsulates Josee&#039;s love for the ocean. The story? An analogy of her dearest memories with Tsuneo. It really pulled my heartstrings. I teared up. <br />
<br />
Alongside the story, Josee featured spectacular technical qualities. From the art to the voice acting, there is nothing I can really complain about at all. The soft lineart along with a colorful palette really suited what this film is about. They were consistent with it, and it allowed for dynamic facial expressions as well. If I were to nitpick something real quick, it would be the 3DCG standing out at times during certain parts of the film. Although that&#039;s not too much of a concern since most of the movie uses animated drawings, I figured to still point it out as a room for improvement. Other than that, I was particularly impressed with its lighting. It&#039;s something a lot of studios tend to cut corners on, but in all honesty good lighting can give your film an entire layer of color. <br />
<br />
The OSTs for Josee were good, though I would not go out of my way to say it is breathtaking. Even so, Eve&#039;s &#039;Ao no Waltz&#039; was quite powerful and incredible, what else can I really comment on. The voice acting, however, was really something else. Kaya Kiyohara really outperformed herself with the Kansai accent and the passionate immersion in her role; but that might just be me with my soft spot for Kansai accents. <br />
<br />
In a romance film, what really matters is the character dynamic. How was it? I do not think their dynamics are original in any way, but it was executed in a manner that did not feel excessively tropey and overused. Pretty much what you might see in other romance series or movies, two main characters and two supporting characters, with the two girls soon falling in love with the same guy. This dynamic faintly reminds me of shows like Toradora, but with a lot less pointless drama. The latter factor allowed me to enjoy this film much more, and I am glad for that. I found the interactions between Josee and Tsuneo to be really cute though. I am weak for blushing, but they just kept blushing in romantically adorable ways. I give them an additional 10 points for tugging my heartstring.<br />
<br />
On the whole, Josee, the Tiger and the Fish does use tropes, it does have character dynamics that have appeared in other shows before. At the same time, it features a promisingly solid story with its own times to truly shine alongside a magnificent production quality. Personally, I am biased to a cute romance couple so I enjoyed it a lot. Would I recommend it? Sure, it is a great film to just watch with a friend or even alone.<br />

    This review contains spoilers<br />
<br />
Josee, The Tiger and the Fish tries to be a romance sol, a self-growth story, and a hobby passion story all at once. While it contains elements to make up each of the things it aspires to be, the movie lacks the nuance to fully become any of them.<br />
<br />
As a romance slice of life, Josee The Tiger and the Fish misses the mark because most of the characters are blank slates. Blank slates can still move, can still take part in great scenes (which the movie isn’t completely devoid of), and can grow to be filled along the way with details. However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404766">
        blank slates are not preferable. They are depthless, often boring, and most importantly, don’t make for good romances. This is because romances are built upon emotional connection, and emotional connection is reliant on character background—something blank slate characters don’t come with.<br />
<br />
The protagonist, Tsuneo, is a typical bland self-insert. Nothing defines him as a character other than his briefly discussed love for diving and the fact that he plans to study abroad. The latter isn’t even a character trait but rather a part of the plot. You can describe Tsuneo by the things he does in this anime, but he has no character outside of the confines of this story; like every other blank slate, he doesn’t even get a backstory. He has no distinct personality and simply exists and acts in the narrative.<br />
<br />
Josee has more personality than Tsuneo. But she still doesn’t get an actual backstory other than a couple spoken details. Like Tsuneo who is defined by his poorly written love for diving, she is defined by her love for the ocean and art. We don’t know what drew towards her art hobby, but Josee at least acts with character rather than being a blank slate pulled by the storyline. As someone who was a bit bossy at first and needed to spend time with Tsuneo to ease up to him, and as someone who reasonably wants to see more of the outside world because she was always kept in her house, her character has enough purpose and depth. She is the only person in the movie that I think passes as a character. And with this in mind, I feel like she should’ve been the protagonist of the story. As the character who grows the most and as the only character with a nuanced personality, it would’ve been sensical and more impactful to have her be point of view for the narrative. There’s literally no reason for her story to be viewed from someone else’s point of view.<br />
<br />
The side characters were disappointing. Josee’s grandmother had no active influence over anything that happened. The only time Josee’s grandmother was remotely relevant to the plot was 1) when she hired Tsuneo at the beginning of the movie and 2) when she died. Josee’s grandmother is none other than a plot device used to initiate Tsuneo and Josee’s relationship and then later add story conflict in it.<br />
<br />
Tsuneo’s friend Mai is the most useless character of all. Their other friend, Hayato, is useless too but he at least seems to know it. Mai on the other hand has a couple scenes that focus on her to make it seem like she’s important, but none of it matters. We don’t know anything about her except that she’s in love Tsuneo for some reason. There really isn’t any detail or meaning to it, but it’s not even important because it doesn’t go anywhere. After her confession, Tsuneo doesn’t react, and the movie just moves on to the next scene. She was likely only put in the movie to make Tsuneo look like a cooler person which was unnecessary and annoying. To begin with, writers need to stop putting female characters in stereotypical roles like this solely for the purpose of making guys seem more likable especially if it has no effect whatsoever on the story. But regardless of whatever the writer&#039;s intention was, her involvement in this movie ended up being nothing more than a hinderance. It was predictable, forgettable, and pointless.<br />
<br />
But even with how poor the characters are, the romance still had some hope. Even blank characters can have decent love stories. You don’t always need a backstory or a completely fleshed out personality to at least create the basic building blocks of a good relationship plotline such as angst, yearning, and affection. All you do need is time and character interaction. But unfortunately, when the characters in this movie interact, it is brief and we’re barely a part of it as the audience. Most of the interactions between Josee and Tsuneo happen in montages. And then after that, Josee’s grandmother dies, they fix things, and then they confess to one another. There are a lot missing details to make a strong connection between the two characters. To say it was impossible for them to be in love isn’t exactly true; We know they’re spending time together, we know they’re encouraging each other in some way, and there are one or two scenes (like when Tsuneo gives Josee the lamp) that we can see the two getting closer to one another. But other than that, there are a lot of parts the audience isn’t involved in which makes their relationship hard to follow. There isn’t much deep conversation between them and majority of the time they spend together is shown to us in short random scenes. Josee, The Tiger and the Fish seems to assume that a meet cute a bunch of montages automatically make a romance. They don’t.<br />
<br />
As a self-growth story, the movie never finds the proper focus either. As mentioned, Josee should’ve been the protagonist of the story. She is the more important main character, and her growth is the most noticeable. Adding the self-insert Tsuneo and having him be the vantage point for someone else’s story is unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Tsuneo’s own growth is flat because none of the ups and down of his development are caused by him or his own action. When Tsuneo gets injured, it is tied to Josee. When Tsuneo decides to get over his grief, it’s because of Josee. It’s great that the two characters encourage each other, but like in every great self-growth story the protagonist needs to have a sense of agency. Tsuneo does not have this, and he is only pulled by Josee and her story.<br />
<br />
This dichotomy of Josee being the important variable of the plot and her never truly being the center of the story due to everything happening from Tsuneo’s point of view creates an imbalance that stunts the emotional impact that the character growth should’ve had. The writers chose the wrong lens, and as a result, the audience never feels like they’re with the person who’s growing.<br />
<br />
This imbalance also affects the other parts of the movie. One of the best scenes is when Josee reads her story to Tsuneo and the kids in the library. The scene is notable because it is the scene where Josee becomes confident enough in herself to properly read to the kids and show them her art. It also shows that she’s going to do her best to be supportive for Tsuneo. She’s gotten over her regret and is making an effort to make amends. As we can see, Josee is the one who’s making a difference here. Not Tsuneo who is listening to her story. Josee is the one who grew the most and got over the lack in self-confidence the whole movie has been building up for her. Yet somehow, Tsuneo is the focus in this scene. Rather than framing it as the important part of Josee’s development that it is, we look at from Tsuneo’s view. And while Tsuneo does get something out of this moment, he is not the one actively self growing and is not the one the story should be focused on.<br />
<br />
Josee, the Tiger and the Fish also falls short as a hobby passion story because none of the character’s passions are actually explored. Other than more montages involving Tsuneo diving, we don’t really delve deep (not a pun) into Tsuneo’s affinity for the activity. He dives, works at a diving store, and knows how to make fish lamps. That’s it. Notice how these are all surface level details loosely linked to diving and not really about the sport itself.<br />
<br />
Because Tsuneo’s love for diving is so poorly written and unexplored, the scene where he almost loses his ability to dive after the accident feels lifeless. He’s sad that he might not be able to dive anymore, and the audience may feel some sympathy from that. But it doesn’t have the same emotional punch as it would have had if we actually knew why and how much Tsuneo loved diving. There’s just a lot of missing build up. All I saw in that scene was someone who almost lost the ability to do something he loved. But that something he loved could’ve been anything. The diving itself is not connected to Tsuneo’s character very well, and we don’t even know anything about why he does it.<br />
<br />
Josee’s love for art is mostly the same. If anything, her art is mostly just a channel for her development and a way to tie in the storyline of her getting over her lack in self confidence. It could’ve been any other hobby and it wouldn’t have made much of a difference because we don’t really know why Josee likes art in the first place. We learn nothing about either diving or art in this movie. They are just parts of the plot loosely related to the characters.<br />
<br />
Now you may be wondering, well if Josee the Tiger and the Fish isn’t a proper romance slice of life, a self-growth story, or a hobby passion story, then what is it? The answer is that it’s a decent movie that simply doesn’t find it’s footing.<br />
<br />
Josee the Tiger and the Fish is easy to watch and has a couple moments with lots of potential. Though it’s quite depthless, has subpar writing, and isn’t properly focused, the movie is simple, isn’t problematic, and is paired with excellent production qualities.<br />
<br />
The art is beautiful and has calming colors. The visual directing isn’t entirely unique, but there are a couple shots that use angles knowledgably and leave you in awe like the scene at the beach and the scenes where Josee falls down the hill. The only big issue I have with the art is the character designs which fall on the plainer side, but the characters are still distinguishable from one another, so this is somewhat of a nitpick.<br />
<br />
The music is by far the best part of the anime. The sound directing is good and the score is fantastic. The absurd amount of montages were manageable because the background music was always incredible, and the slower more focused scenes were accompanied with well-fitting instrumentals. There was also an evident use of dynamics. Trains passing by and the sounds of the city were expertly portrayed with varying levels of loudness. Eve’s theme song was an excellent addition as well. Played towards the end, it gave the movie much needed energy.<br />
<br />
Josee, The Tiger and the Fish is an unbalanced movie with an unclear story direction. It has plain characters who don’t offer much to the narrative, poor focus, and a lot of missing details needed to attain its aim of becoming either a slice of life romance, a self-growth story, or a hobby passion anime. There is nothing exceptional about this film, and most of the plot points are wasted potential. Despite this, it’s far from a horrible movie. The one or two memorable scenes may or may not leave a personal impact depending on the viewer, the art is consistently great, and the sounds are stunning. I won’t recommend this anime, and I’d direct anyone looking for something similar to Koe no Katachi which easily has better characterization. But Josee, the Tiger and the Fish is a generally harmless movie. So if you’re just looking for a chill anime with great audiovisuals, this may be the one for you.

    Mediocre story, dull progression , one dimensional characters, zero emotions, over-dramatic premise = Josee, the Tiger and the Fish<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been waiting for this movie for quite sometime, because the Korean Live Action of this is one of my All Time Favourite. I haven&#039;t read the original source material on which one followed the source faithfully but this anime adaptation is abysmal to say the least.<br />
<br />
Story : Mundane story, with tons of events and drama with out any substance to it. I thought the story might delve on the issue of person going through disability and might touch on it a bit more. But this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402056">
        was all about our characters having little shenanigans for getting other&#039;s attention. If you thought synopsis on MAL was monotonous, I&#039;m afraid movie is even more lacklustre.<br />
<br />
Characters : Everyone in the movie was uninspiring dull, one dimensional card boards. I couldn&#039;t feel the emotions behind any of these expressionless characters. Josee our female lead despite being 24 acted as if she was 12 or something. Petulant, up her own ass and yearning for pity. Meanwhile, our male lead after a certain point (despite being serious I found that incident hilarious) in the movie became a dick, despite everything being his own choice. But as you might expect from Anime, Power of Words and friendship swayed his heart. As for the rest of the cast they&#039;re there for fan-service and filling screen space.<br />
<br />
Art : Art was extremely good and really adored all the visuals of the movie.<br />
<br />
Sound : Nothing special in this department as well. I wish Voice actors could have put more emotions to make these lifeless characters more real life. Also, Ending song felt more like &quot;Your name&quot; wannabe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, do yourself a favor, instead of wasting time on whatever nonsense this version tried to pull, I highly suggest to watch the Korean live-action of this movie. It is 100 times better than this garbage.

    THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER-FREE.<br />
<br />
The concept of having a handicapped one step by step gaining the recognition from others is not something new to anime fan, but hardly all of them are good enough to be watched with pleasure. Even “Koe no katachi”, one of the best amongst the genre, still receives conflicting opinions as it digs real deep into a sensitive and thorny problem that modern societies are witnessing – discrimination and despising ones with impairments.<br />
<br />
I’m not going to compare “Koe no katachi” to “Josee, the Tiger and the Fish’, but as it comes to movies about this topic, the former had somewhat set a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407771">
        way too high standard, which really blurred several other films coming thereafter.<br />
<br />
However, I have to admit that somehow Josee caught my attention from its very first trailer, and this might be the case when it hardly gave us any details about the movie and awakened the intriguing part inside of me. What Josee had to cope with, why did it happen to her, how did Tsuneo become her caretaker, why did real harsh things were said to her,...<br />
<br />
Well, not all of them were answered throughout the movie.<br />
<br />
Let us discuss its shortcomings first.<br />
<br />
Movies about disabled people, and anime to be specific, usually tell a seamless story, from indicating their past of having impairments to how they coped with them in normal day life, then the story might show up some tragedies, displaying their sense of helplessness and ultimately they found the courage to overwhelmed them altogether. “Josee, the Tiger and the Fish”, however, followed an unfamiliar pattern, which skipped the very first step and jumped right into the next one by introducing Josee, her disability and the other protagonist – Tsuneo – all at once. “She was born like this”, said by her grandmother, and that’s all what we know about her impairments.<br />
<br />
Having said that, there was a real quick scene displaying her condition drawn by her own in her room, but as for my opinion, this indication was hardly noticed by viewers and not something that should be done instead of having a small story on how she grew up with it. Either a quick flashback or a cut of her afternoon dream would be clearer.<br />
<br />
Storyline pacing, which should have not been a problem, is yet a huge question mark. The first 40 minutes was perfectly slow and gentle, but then 2 tragic twists came up one by one without any signs, too abrupt that the empathy of viewers for the first tragedy had yet to come when the second one stroke onto Josee. This was a huge trouble as one thing distinguishing this genre is the power to move viewers’ heart and touch their compassion.<br />
 <br />
These abrupt shifts somewhat created a slight sense of confusion amongst viewers instead of gaining their sympathy, thereby may lead to misleading thoughts or difficulties in perceiving moral lessons displaying throughout the movie.<br />
<br />
Aside from above drawbacks, the studio (Bones) and the movie director did not let us down in terms of visuals and BGM. Such detailed every scene was that reminded me of Shinkai Makoto’s products like “Your name” and “Garden of Words”, which made it easier for the storyline, the characters, and the movie as a whole to fulfill viewers’ enjoyment.<br />
<br />
The design of characters was not something so odd, but it still somehow stood out from other movies lately, and this might be the case when there were just few of them that required being polished. We got to see Tsuneo’s 2 colleagues, along with their boss at the shop, Josee’s grandmother and a librarian being well-drawn to every single gesture or action. Others, however, did not follow this same pattern when their faces as long as their movements seemed a bit raw; and even if this may look like I am too tough on it, this is the one that should have been better done by the studio due to the fact that those characters listed above had their time on-screen and played their particular role in contributing to the development of our 2 main characters.<br />
<br />
The storyline, which I first thought would be complicated and lackluster, was surprisingly slow and simple. It clearly illustrated the movie’s purpose and moral lesson in a real predictable way, but still somehow managed to present a slight sense of confusion. Therefore, it is hard for one to recognize it as good or bad, vivid or dull, worth-watching or not; but from my point of view, how straightforward the story was something we could accept because it was not the real point of the whole movie.<br />
<br />
As I proceeded to watch the movie after feeling quite cringy about 2 consecutive tragedies striking, I figured it out that those 2 were just some tragic twists in order to emphasize the moral lessons about the courage to never give up. Predictable? Yes, it was. In addition, there was a whole screen of Josee’s storytelling at nearly the end of the movie which I adored so much, talking about not only giving unlucky people impetus on continuing their dreams but also pinpointing the peak of character development throughout the entire movie.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of “Josee, the Tiger and the Fish” distinguishing it from lately anime is the changing of colour tones. You can easily notice how nebulous the movie was at its very first 10-20 minutes, which marginally turned brighter and brighter as the connection between the 2 main characters being developed and hit the highest note at the finale. This was not something new to anime because we witnessed the shift of “music colour” in “Your lie in April” or the voices in “Koe no katachi”, but using colour as a way to depict the development of relationship was quite exceptional and amazingly well-performed by Bones.<br />
<br />
The movie itself was not fantastic, but it stepped beyond the mediocre standard of its kind and left behind several authentic marks.<br />
<br />
It was enjoyable because of the straightforward and simply predictable storyline.<br />
<br />
It was a sweet pie for whom being alone.<br />
<br />
It was a picture of modern society’s thorn about how we treat people with less luck than us.<br />
<br />
It was meaningful because of hidden lessons and motivation.<br />
<br />
And it was a real memorable movie thanks to its ending song along with an adorable after credit.<br />

    Overall i`ts a good movie.<br />
I love how they`re make Tsuneo become a caregiver for Josee, which is not in the LA version.<br />
The seiyuu of Josee is my favorite, the accent she has really fit on the Josee character. Visual and art from studio bones is goddamn good and also the music from E ve gives me a goosebumps on the cinema. some people tell me that the pace story of this movie is too fast but that`s acceptable for me. and the most important things is the ending, it`s feel like a cure for my dissapointed on the LA version LOL

    I just came back from the theatres and I want to say that this movie is really good. Watched this with the bros and we enjoyed it. It has a great soundtrack, beautiful art and the story is pretty good. Corona ain&#039;t stopping me from watching this but remember social distance and wear your mask. <br />
<br />
As you go into the movie you will start to fall in love with the characters. You got the girl in wheelchair, josee(best girl) . Black hair kind dude,tsuneo and the other few side characters. Well designed and the VA they chose for the characters did a good job. <br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395943">
        art is beautiful 9 to 10/10. Thank you for blessing my eyes.<br />
<br />
Story is probably the weakest part I think but its still pretty good. It&#039;s something abit different and they don&#039;t waste your time on dumb shit and executes it really well. I didn&#039;t get emotional though but it got me feeling empty. <br />
<br />
The music in this anime is AMAZING. It&#039;s made by eve (The dude that made JJK opening) <br />
<br />
OVERALL 8/10 which is really good definitely recommend you to watch this but it will make you feel empty. Wish i had a girl like josee by my side<br />
<br />
<br />

    This movie sounded amazing. Evan Call&#039;s soundtracks really elevated some of the more emotional and dramatic scenes, and Eve never ceases to amaze me with how good their songs are. Studio Bones absolutely nailed the animation too; from super detailed (and really cute!) characters to beautiful scenery shots, they certainly brought their A game here. 9/10 for both Art and Sound, for sure.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the positives kinda stop there. What followed from an enthralling premise and a breathtaking first half-hour was a runaway train towards narrative disaster. I really wish I could tear into how poorly executed its dramatic lows were, but I want this review

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396718">
        to be as spoiler-free as possible so I can hopefully warn potential watchers on what to expect.<br />
<br />
Story - 2/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s your run-of-the-mill romcom, sure, and it is fairly cute and heartwarming at times, but don&#039;t expect any form of realistic or sensible drama. Everything in the story conveniently happens to push the sickeningly cliched plot forward, to the point where its ludicrosity transcends into comedy. Even ignoring that, the general plot direction is so boring that I could name a dozen similar, but better executed shows. Bunny Girl Senpai&#039;s movie comes to mind - the dramatic climax and aftermath is pretty much identical, but the build-up to that in this movie was far shallower and more contrived. The movie then becomes obsessed with digging the drama hole further and further, layering more and more tragedies onto the characters until it barely feels tragic anymore. As if it couldn&#039;t get worse, this is followed up with the cheesiest rendition of &#039;Hopes and Dreams will Save the World!&#039; that I&#039;ve ever seen. Ah yes, hopes and dreams are able to resolve physical and practical impossibilities. As long as we believe, we&#039;ll get the perfect relationship out of an extremely frayed and toxic one just 10 minutes prior! But that leads me on to...<br />
<br />
Characters - 3/10<br />
<br />
No, Josee making snarky, rude quips at random points in the show does not make her a well-written character. She is exaggerated past any reasonable point - I get the defensiveness and spite towards the world around her, but the movie is so quick to make 180 degree switches between that and her completely happy and trusting side so... anything gives? The male protagonist gives me heavy harem MC vibes - dense, overly nice for no reason, and somehow every female in the show falls in love with him, despite completely missing backstories for some of them. Speaking of which, the side characters were somehow done even worse. Not a single one managed to remotely stand out, and got so little development and screentime that I couldn&#039;t even remember their names. The characters are only marginally better than the plot, but that&#039;s honestly because nothing can get worse than the plot.<br />
<br />
Overall/Enjoyment - 5/10<br />
<br />
All in all, it&#039;s not all bad. The story occasionally hints at the start of potentially good ideas, and its latter half makes some attempt to link to its promising first half-hour. But virtually everything that made that first half-hour stand out - the main duo&#039;s hobbies, constraints, and budding friendship (which was actually really nicely developed) - gets thrown out of the window once the drama hits. For such a talented production team, it&#039;s a real letdown. At least I got a couple nice additions to my playlist out of this.

    Will be a controversial one but i don&#039;t think josee deserves a good rating. It lacks in character development and the build up is extremely rushed that it loses its essential. All the climax and supposed-to-be emotional moment feel so bland because the lack in character introduction<br />
<br />
Story suppose to be great, i mean - a broken dream and hopeless disabled person and its struggle to achieving their dream is supposed to be sad, right? but sadly its not executed well. The movie feels so bland with side characters that are not giving any significant contribution to the story. All the emotional moment came with little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398735">
        to no backstory that makes the audience doesn&#039;t feel the same sadness as the character feels<br />
<br />
The art is nothing too amazing, either. The animation in this movie is very advertisement-like and its nothing really special and nothing to be mentioned about. The music are nice, thats a good point and there are some wholesome moment in the start - but the execution and climax is so bland - and the ending feels a little bit weird by jumping from one story arc to another real quick.<br />
<br />
A forgettable movie, but still pretty enjoyable. Especially if you love this kind of sad ambience<br />
<br />
P.s: Josee is the worst tsundere ever make an appearance lol, she makes nino nakano in season 1 looks a bit better

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
First of all. i want to tell u about, how excited that i cant w8 before i watch the movie, i had watched all the pv trailer, mv from eve.  As u can see the art from them is so amazing right and the sound is really nice to hear. The character development is really fit my character taste (modern anime chara style, good looking, evertyhing good about the character art).<br />
<br />
From the story i give 10/10<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
2 aspect ;<br />
1. background arts (such a background places like a station train, beach, city, library, sky, ocean, etc.) were really realistic and beautiful since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401667">
        its from real life references.<br />
2. object arts (such a things that can move like a character(subject), wheelchair, fish, wind fan, car, etc.) were really fit with background arts.<br />
<br />
Sounds 10/10<br />
there  3 aspect ;<br />
1. (25%) scene background sounds, really enjoying to hear and nice to hear. I can say some scene with bg sound was really make u feelings (emotion, vibes)<br />
2. (40%) character sounds. most of unique chracter voice in this movie for me is only on josee voice, fits the character really well with the cutee unique voice also with her unique accent(marked on my mind like &quot;hatarakiya&quot;, &quot;kanrininya&quot;). The expression sound by character like tsuneo and jose were really good and make a good vibes. Anyone else did really good to hear with some expression like hayato meet jose :v.<br />
3. (35%) movie song. No doubt (take me far away, kokoro umi, ao no waltz).<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
3 aspect ;<br />
1. (50%) characters art. is modern future style good human animation, more natural with background arts.<br />
2. (25%)  characters personality(manner, behavior, attitude). they had their own, example josee is plain tsundere girl had disability and have manner like to saying spicy word to a guy that probably make a mistake to her and maybe she is intererst with a guy good looking, or maybe she is just plain :&gt;. She was a dreamer girl and dont really know how the real world happeni for her because she has disability :&lt; because she meet tsuneo she want to be like him(can do what she want and her can do in real life be real) but the situation made her give up :&lt;.<br />
3. (25%) character looking. main female (very unique) = beautiful, hairstyle cutest, her small cutest body sitting on the bench make someone want to pick her up. has disability :&lt; crawling everywhere. i&#039;ve seen in my life a life of disability person ya its broke my heart :&lt;, yea u could see few a disability guy who motivated that he/she can swim and do everything like normal people can do, but not every disability could the same thing cause things its different (mentality, people around/family that can help u or alone :&lt;, strength) simply word &quot;just living more harder than normal person&quot; even he/she used to it. Example i normal guy living alone going to workplace is only takes 30min in avg daily life from prepare to already in workplace. but disability guy can takes more than that in avg daily life. main male character = (could be had looked alike from another anime) cool guy, tall, the body looking good at sport(such running, swim, etc) . anyone else has their own looking but mostly normal and ordinary looked alike from another anime and only josee grandmother is not looked alike from another anime. nobody looking bad here :v.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
cant w8 before watch causes pv trailer, mv eve really good anime/animation and arts. after watched because i like drama, slice of life and there is sound good to hear in some scene make a good vibes and feelings. at the end i join applause because in the cinema people were applause XD. after that ending song credits :v back to calm watch :&gt;<br />
<br />
Overall 11/10<br />
high tier anime/animation. For sure<br />
<br />
She died in piece btw :&gt; but at the same time :&lt;<br />
<br />
She left her grandchild alone living with disability :&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

    (No spoilers)<br />
This is my favorite anime movie of all time from what I&#039;ve seen so far, the themes and the emotion put into this made this movie so lifeful. <br />
<br />
Story 10/10 - Such a wonderful story, I loved it from start to finish! This movie is truly inspirational and meaningful, as the themes of this story are never giving up your dream and growing up. The events that the main duo and everybody else go through are done to an almost perfect extent.. The romance is bliss, it wasn&#039;t forced nor was it cringe, it had a perfectly natural flow, and it was truly a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401967">
        treat to see. The atmosphere and tone here are consistent and impeccable, it made the movie, like I said, feel more lifeful. The narrative from start to finish was absolutely stunning and immersive.<br />
<br />
Art - The movie had good art, though to movies like Garden of words, it pales rather averagely... Is what you&#039;d think, the simplistic art is wasn&#039;t a drawback at all! It in fact made the movie much more... Real maybe, it gave an immersive feeling and it was also another factor of the amazing atmosphere it had. <br />
<br />
Characters - 10/10 <br />
<br />
Now my favorite part of this movie... The characters. The main duo have amazing character development and character progression. A truly beautiful take on &quot;growing up with each other&quot; kind of development. What the movie is trying to tell us is shown through the growth of the main duo<br />
<br />
The main duo undoubtedly have the best dynamic out of any anime movie I&#039;ve seen thus far, and their dynamic is what made us feel emotions for the two, and the dilemmas and struggles they face through the movie made it hit more hard because of that. The sympathy you can feel through the character&#039;s hardships are due to how real the characters feel.<br />
<br />
The side characters also serve a good purpose within the story, and are solid characters themselves.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10/10<br />
Amazing soundtrack! the sound is also a factor of the realistic atmosphere it gave, the use of sound through each moment was fantastic! The emotional feel it gives elevates every scene, the music also interprets on how the characters feel. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10/10<br />
I have never enjoyed an anime movie to this extent! well maybe, &quot;night is short, walk on girl&quot; is pretty close but still! The emotions this movie gave me... are really like none other. The beautifully executed themes, the immersive growth of the duo and their romantic moments and the overall purpose and message of the story. <br />
 <br />
Overall - 10/10<br />
Many thanks to the people that read this review fully. To conclude my review, I will just say that please, give this movie a shot, it&#039;s amazing. Thanks for reading.

    I was a little excited when I found out about this movie, since it have a great score and it&#039;s on top 100 anime on this site, so I decided to watch it with my friends. <br />
<br />
I already watched most of the top anime movies so I was in search of even more great movies and me finding about this anime was a perfect fit for this situation.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s get into it-<br />
<br />
This movie from the first 10 minutes was bad, everything, except for the art style was so bad I couldn&#039;t even comprehend the entire thing. <br />
<br />
The story was a poor excuse for a clicheich

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409716">
        type of thing that you usually see in american based style of movies, therefore being a very poor choice to combine the simplistic western style type with a story for an anime. I see that anime movies start to do the same with other stories, especially those that are fairy tale Disney type of thing, which in my opinion strip the beauty and &quot;specialiy&quot; that all anime bring.<br />
<br />
Now about the characters all I can say is that they were so bad and lacked personality so much that at the end of the movie I forgot even their names. I never felt any emotion for any of them especially for the girl in the wheelchair which they gave the &quot;I&#039;m angry cause I&#039;m not healthy and I have the right to treat others like I want&quot; type of cliche that threw me off from the start. Other characters felt soulless and they never gave away any true emotion, not even in &quot;sad&quot; parts of this movie. <br />
Not even for the romance moments I never felt any true feeling from them, it was all like a forced &quot;connection&quot; between them.<br />
<br />
The art style was the only thing that was good, in fact very good about all this anime, as expected from studio Bones, but it still felt like I was watching a 2010 anime movie(not a problem though).<br />
<br />
Everything sound related from music. osts etc were so simple and poor that made this even harder and boring to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall I do not recommend this at all if you are in search for a emotional, romantic, drama story. Just pass this onto your next option, I can almost 100% guarantee that your next option will be way better than this failure.<br />
<br />
If you read until here, then thank you for your time, and know that this was my first review ever. <br />
Wrote this cause this was the worst anime I had ever watched, so I wanted to let you know how bad truly is from someone perspective other than the usual people that are satisfied with absolute simplicity.

    Josee to Tora to Sakana-tachi - 9.5/10<br />
<br />
 AN EXAMPLE.  AN ART.<br />
<br />
 I already had high expectations for this film, as it presents a different dramatic novel with beautiful visuals, however, this film goes further.  It made me think, feel and above all, put me in the place of our main character.<br />
<br />
 Can you imagine being unable to do what you want because of a physical disability?  You can&#039;t and maybe, don&#039;t even want to.  This movie puts you in the mind of a person who feels incapable, weak, having to get used to living a life locked inside his room, for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402472">
        the sake of security against the cruelty of that world.<br />
<br />
 Josee is disabled, unable to walk and lives with her grandmother in a small house.  Always inside her room, the dreamer Josee wants to see the world, feel what she still can&#039;t feel, and more than that, fulfill her father&#039;s wish and taste the &quot;taste of the sea&quot;.  Everything seems to be far away, it seems every day to get more distant and difficult, locked inside her own aquarium, trapped in her room.<br />
<br />
 On the other hand, we have the hardworking Tsuneo, who studies and works hard every day to fulfill his dream of studying in Mexico and fulfilling his dream of diving with some fish that are only in the waters there.  Yes, Tsuneo is a fish lover and dives as often as possible, even working in a shop like that.<br />
<br />
 The anime actually starts when Tsuneo and Josee meet, in a comical and cute way, where at first there is a feeling of estrangement, and this becomes a love.<br />
<br />
 - WHAT DO I THINK?<br />
<br />
 Joose doesn&#039;t try to be realistic or anything like that, but he manages very well to get through the drama of someone incapable.  Perhaps this is his great differential, and this differential he executes with mastery!<br />
<br />
 As I said, he doesn&#039;t try to be realistic, that is, there are situations where yes, it gets super dramatic or with enough scripted convenience.  The fact is that this footprint is not wrong, as it is propositional to generate the super dramatization, which when combined with a fanciful or artistic premise, forms something very &quot;warm&quot; and pleasant to watch.<br />
<br />
 The characters are few, so they all seem to have a nice use, although yes, the film in the end seems to be a bit rushed, but nothing that really bothers, as the film pays off a lot with the beginning and development of his drama.  Several things happen, of course, all of them with a weight for each character, but always with a special focus on the protagonists.<br />
<br />
 What could be a problem would be a misunderstanding in the middle of the film, which in the end doesn&#039;t have much relevance and is even a little too much.  The result of this drama is a rapprochement of characters and greater intimacy, but I believe there are several ways to do this.  Still, I can see value in the scene, as it is perfectly understandable that a girl like Josee would be very upset with the situation, since Tsuneo was the closest person to him at that time.  Jealousy is something we cannot control.  As much as I think it could be done differently, I appreciate it and for me, it doesn&#039;t change anything, after all, if it&#039;s functional, my taste doesn&#039;t matter.<br />
<br />
 The film is animated by the Bones studio, who did an AMAZING job THROUGHOUT THE FILM, with no downfall of animation or script.  The soundtrack is equally IMPECCABLE, matching all the emotions that the film wants to convey and feel. There&#039;s a lot of sentimental artistry in this movie, if you don&#039;t pay attention, maybe you won&#039;t get some feeling or something.  I advise you to see with your heart.<br />
<br />
 In the end, I say that this is a work that has good elements that are not further deepened ON PURPOSE, as it is not the focus of the film to be a Koe no Katachi, to tell about the daily life of a paraplegic and her difficulties, but to talk about a disabled person who feels UNABLE to achieve her dreams.  It&#039;s two completely different things.  What&#039;s more, what Josee does is enough, because when placed in the protagonist&#039;s vision and how the world treats her, you feel in your own skin what it is like not to be able to be &quot;like&quot; everyone.<br />
<br />
 SEE THIS WORK OF ART.

    Josee to Tora to Sakana-tachi is one of the most light and heavy hearted movies out there. With it&#039;s similar topics to Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice) it feels nothing like it. It starts off with a guy looking to find work to be able to. travel abroad to study. One night he stumbles upon a girl who is violently steering to save her self from the steep road and how most might imagine Tsuneo is there to catch her after she falls out of her wheelchair. He&#039;s then invited back to josee&#039;s grandmothers place and is given a meal as a thanks. Her

        grandmother offers Tsuneo to work for her. The job is to take care of Josee. At this time Josee has not excepted him yet but it makes sense due to the lack of her going out. Her grandma says that there&#039;s &quot;tigers in the real world.&quot; meaning the bad people who are out to cease havoc. One day Josee is put up with being cooped in the house all day and decides to go on her own meanwhile  Tsuneo shows up looking to tell them that he doesn&#039;t want to work for them anymore because Josee can&#039;t seem to accept him. He goes on to find josee trying to cross a railway while it&#039;s not safe. He saves her from being run over by the train. She then proceeds to act sketch near Tsuneo. She proposes to him that if he doesn&#039;t take her to see the ocean she&#039;ll scream and accuse him of harassment. At this point Tsuneo is put up with listening to her bad mouth him to he says &quot;do what you want I&#039;m going home.&quot; But seconds later it cuts to hime back holding her wheelchair and takes her there. This is where the story takes off. I always look for character development in movies and in this movie it sparked well beyond my expectation. <br />

Story 10/10         The story is well rounded and never lacks consistency.<br />
Art 9/10             Not even just the visual art but the theme of the movie is art itself.<br />
Sound 9/10        Very soft and good production!<br />
Character 10/10 You can&#039;t hate any of the characters and they develop nicely.<br />
Enjoyment 10/10    I could watch this 100 times over and never get tired of it.<br />
Overall 10/10.      BRAVO!<br />

It&#039;s beautiful in the way Josee is seen as a mermaid who wants to explore the world. Both characters are both interested in the sea so it makes sense they would come together. Near the end of the movie Josee&#039;s grandmother dies and she can&#039;t afford to pay for Tsuneo to look over her anymore. This affects Tsuneo and he can&#039;t concentrate while diving like forgetting to refill his oxygen tank. Worrying about Josee&#039;s doing he goes to see her and she insists on one last task for him being a &quot;servant&quot; Is what she called him. And that was to taker her to the ocean. The visuals play a big rolein this movie as when Tsuneo and Josee standing in front of the ocean the sky is grey and cloudy setting the tone for the mood. Josee earlier was told that Tsuneo was leaving in March to go to Mexico to continue his studies. Tsuneo contemplating weather or not to tell her he&#039;s going is smacked in the face with the fact she already knew thanks to Mai&#039;s doing. She leaves the scene and this is where things take a turn to set up the ending. While crossing a busy road her wheelchair gets stuck and a car is coming head on as always Tsuneo is there to protect her the car hits him and he is rushed to the hospital and in that moment sparked character development from Josee. Showing she really does care for him starts panicking. Tsuneo is later on told that he has Osteoarthritis and that he is in critical condition and theres little chance it will heal. Ironic that this happened before his trip to Mexico. Meanwhile Josee is at home wondering where to move foward. She then is approached by Mai who&#039;s also in love with Tsuneo. They go back and forth bring Josee&#039;s feelings for Tsuneo more evident. She finds time to write and illustration book to read out loud to the kids. Oh i should add that she is an amazing artist. Anyways Tsuneo joins in at the reading club and listens to her read a book about a mermaid which was inspired by their own story. At the very end of the movie it end with josee falling down a steep road again after being pushed by a guy chasing after his dog. She then lands into Tsuneo like at the begging although this time she&#039;s not calling him a pervert but is happy he&#039;s there. They both state their love for each other and kiss. If you watch till the end of the credits Tsuneo is there sitting next to her on the bench because he just came back for break they sit there and laugh together and then it zooms out and ends. You can&#039;t be unsatisfied with the ending they presented you.  This is definitely worth all of the credit that&#039;s why considering the art style the theme, the characters and the production in general this movies seems to ace all of them. Definitely a 10/10

    (TLDR Review at the bottom, as always, thanks for reading)<br />
<br />
How does one captivate the human?<br />
<br />
Shiny colours and ever so beautiful atmosphere seems to do a good job, and I will be the first to admit that I am no one immune to such visual beauty, in fact, I praise such effort so much so that I would defend anything that only exists to present a visual spectacle rather than an elegant story. But alas, knowledge is power. I have to admit I came into Josee, the Tiger and the Fish (will abbreviate to Josee Tiger Fish) with high hopes, I was drawn by its gleaming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402026">
        looks, but a glimpse is never enough to understand the full picture of anything. It&#039;s only when you look in, does that standard become more of a concrete rule of thumb. Josee Tiger Fish unfortunately checks out. In a story based on dreams and the lengths to reach them, it is kinda ironic that it is possible to be misled by the very same illusions brought forward to us.<br />
<br />
<br />
Narrative:<br />
My main issue with Josee Tiger Fish is its shamelessness in throwing things for the sake of doing so. Josee Tiger Fish loves to make the plot happen for the sake of tension, heartstring-pulling and every other trick out of the book. There are quite a few times when characters would change their initial emotional image or other times when something significant would happen just because the story deemed it to be, the number of twists is almost shocking, and the result, all of this is nothing more than shallow. Given that this is a movie, I gave the benefit of the doubt, there is only so much room, but in that case, it should have been a longer movie, just something that would make it less &quot;all talk&quot;, but to even more disappointment, nothing really was given. You are now suddenly dealing with this cliche body, maybe generic, but I actually wouldn&#039;t call it that. Anyways, for some reason, cliche and generic is looked down upon, though I beg to differ, on the contrary, there is good to speak of with such a standard, more so Josee Tiger Fish did manage to break free from true generic by embracing simplicity, something I would love to imagine everyone finds good in. To be fair, the visuals helped out in this a lot with that factor but considering that this is a movie, with no real intention of being ambitious to the point of killing any kind of simplicity, I find the movie holds water in that category. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve tied characters up with the story segment a little, but for more depth on the characters, I do actually find them to be equally as shallow as the story. Getting onto Tsuneo, and this man has no tact for himself, he is thrown about in the story, made to do things that need to be done for the sake of it, I can&#039;t call his character anything interesting because all we end up seeing is a destined experience, or in other words, he was never going to have anything for him going in the first place. One redeeming factor about him though is that at least he actually has a decent background to himself, it may not be the most original, but it wasn&#039;t as if the writers intentionally left it out, there is something of this shell of a man. As for Josee, she was annoying as hell but everything about her made sense to some extent, she casually allowed for melodrama to slip in every now and then but it didn&#039;t bother me too much given her behaviour, to begin with. Other side characters were fine, Mai however, is one of the reasons why I would call this story melodramatic, her intentions and attitudes do not align in the slightest, so that allowed for her to wander off and cause trouble that would eventually amount to null. A wasted character, but nothing of a big loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals:<br />
In one word. Amazing. Hearing Bones was on job obviously compelled me even more to watch this, and I can say that Bones did an amazing job no question about it. Fluid animation, amazing designs and detail, great scenery. I am not saying anymore, how good it is in the trailer is how good it is in the final product.<br />
<br />
As for audio, good stuff too, recognisable artists such as Eve on the job here too. However, the OST didn&#039;t really stick to me as some other movies did, I am not entirely sure why that was the case, but it kinda just didn&#039;t I suppose, but it was all in all pretty good stuff. The same can be said with the seiyuus here, I didn&#039;t have too much of a problem with them and they nailed their job in conveying the characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Despite my criticism, I am an honest man. Letting go of any kind of &quot;intelligent&quot; analysis, and like the simple human I am, I enjoyed this, a lot. Wholesomeness, all around shiny colours, and some shitty cheesy development I don&#039;t usually find myself saying no to, honestly, what is there here that isn&#039;t to enjoy. I don&#039;t recommend looking deep into this too, by the way, it may hinder your experience with this, as it did for me a little, getting annoyed at plot devices that you should have seen coming from the get-go. For a simple movie, it did exceptionally well as what is presented, I would 100% watch again if I had time to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.8 (8)<br />
----------<br />
<br />
TLDR Review:<br />
Story - 6: Pretty baseline story that only has the benefit of the doubt because it is a movie. Shamelessly throws too many things for the sake of it, ends up being shallow.<br />
Visuals - 10: Do I even need to say anything? It is amazing in every aspect.<br />
Audio - 9: Great OST, not very memorable, but entirely loveable regardless.<br />
Characters - 6: Somewhat shallow and personality aren&#039;t amazing, but are fine for the most part.<br />
Enjoyment - 8: I enjoyed this for sure. Very wholesome and worth my time.<br />
----------<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been waiting for this movie for a hot minute and I finally got the chance to watch it, was a good one, would recommend it for sure, hell, I would say this is watchable for about literally anyone who isn&#039;t cynical or overly critically. This also gives a ton of vibes from other anime if you are experienced in the medium, namely Toradora and Silent Voice. Both are also something worth your time. <br />
<br />
Idk why I went into Josee Tiger Fish with such high hopes though really, wasn&#039;t really all that but it served its part for sure. Was worth the wait too, anime movies tend to be really amazing at short and simple, mostly because, they already are to some extent lol. But where Josee Tiger Fish is nothing more than a Disney Princess, good looking but nothing deep, to the point of some disappointment, I had a good time, and that&#039;s all that matters.<br />

    overall score: -low nine- (9.2)<br />
<br />
This is literally the embodiment of art itself, The coloring, music, directing all of it is done almost flawlessly. But the true spotlight here is josee and tsuneo. seeing them both grow, understanding there own feeling, learning something new and supporting each other without actually interfering with each others dream.<br />
<br />
Chasing your dream and also caring for what means the most to you is equally important but what makes it hard is the journey to achieving that. To know the painful truth of reality and the feeling to just not wanting to do anything is something that everyone will feel sooner or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401893">
        later but what makes it different from those who succeed in conquering those problem and from those who doesn&#039;t? That is the answer that they have to figure out themselves because everyone has there own answer and each of those answer will led to a new path.<br />
<br />
what happen to josee or tsuneo can happen to anyone. forced to give up your dream, unfortunate circumstances that led you to give up or not knowing where to go at some point in life can happen to anyone. and what exactly makes this movie beautiful is how each of them find those answer and conquer each problem, the way how each character show there feeling to one another is something very heart warming and beautiful in a way.<br />
<br />
<br />
(spoiler section)<br />
<br />
1. this movie portrays all the citizen or rather the unnamed character looks and feel like all of them is so evil and all they do is doing evil stuff which was a weird feeling and a odd way of portraying that.<br />
<br />
2. if ninomiya (the side girl who lost) didn&#039;t come to josee&#039;s house to declare her war against josee, josee would probably still be staying at there home doing nothing and tsuneo may just give up his dream. so the real MVP here is ninomiya.<br />

    [Non-Spoiler Review]<br />
<br />
I finally watched this movie in the theatre last friday with my friend and decided to give a review about this movie.<br />
<br />
This movie told us about not to lose hope even if you are miles away from reaching your dreams. Honestly, this movie was really amazing and wholesome! exceeded my expectations, and bring tears to my eye. There were many different type of character personalities that made this story feel more alive. i love the character designs and the artstyle, i don&#039;t even know why but somehow i like it very much. i will never forget the climax&#039;s resolution, that part really made me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399556">
        emotional and i cried there a little bit (thank god my friend didn&#039;t saw me cry XD). what made me even cried more is the OST, especially from Eve. If you don&#039;t know Eve is, he was the one who create the opening song for Jujutsu Kaisen. &quot;Ao No Waltz&quot; Was Amazing, But &quot;Shinkai&quot;? For me that song was out of this world, after hearing that from the theatre i can&#039;t just stop listening it for 24/7. &quot;Shinkai&quot; was the first song ever that really touched my heart the most. So In Overall, I totally recommend you to watch this movie. it&#039;s really worth it!

    Recently, the anime community has been going on and on about a new movie made by Bones. There was no doubt it would have fantastic art and animation, and the fact that it was a dramatic slice of life related to disability and the growth of university students instantly made me interested. However, was the hype really worth the hour and a half watch time? Personally, I don’t think it was.<br />
<br />
The plot itself is fine, nothing special really. Like I mentioned previously, the plot is literally just that of a standard drama series, which is completely fine, but it doesn&#039;t try and do anything special

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403931">
        (or even go simple). This can still work, but I&#039;ll explain that part later.<br />
That being said, even besides that, it did have a few plot twists going on, but in my opinion, they were very predictable. For some people, that wouldn&#039;t be a problem, but these two things make me think that JTTATF has very little identity for itself. It feels almost as if it&#039;s scared to stray away from the standard tropes that dramas have, and I often just found myself comparing it to other dramas. I will say that it isn&#039;t exactly a bad plot, but I wasn&#039;t a fan of it myself.<br />
<br />
The characters are the major selling point of this movie, but if you weren&#039;t a big fan of them, then you probably won&#039;t enjoy this at all (which is why the story didn&#039;t sell me). Unfortunately, besides Tsuneo, this wasn&#039;t the case for me. I honestly didn&#039;t like Josee at all. She was really annoying for the majority of the movie, and while I get some of that was due to outside influence, I just thought that the way she was didn&#039;t make up for it, especially considering her age. Her progression was okay, but I still didn&#039;t really like her. Tsuneo, however, was great and was a really interesting and likeable character; he had many relatable or emotional moments which did really resonate with me.<br />
The rest of the supporting cast were extremely forgettable and/or served as a plot device. One of the characters is literally only there to form drama for absolutely no reason, and that annoyed me a lot when it happened, because it was so unnecessary to the plot.<br />
<br />
The art and animation themselves were absolutely beautiful, as to be expected from Bones. Every shot and scene was animated absolutely beautifully, and the animation was superb. It felt almost like a mix of KyoAni and ComiX Wave. The music was fitting at almost every part, but unfortunately, I don&#039;t really remember any of the tracks. Eve did a good song for the ending with Ao no Waltz. The voice acting was fantastic in my opinion; despite how I feel about Josee, I loved her voice.<br />
<br />
Now, with all of that said and done, I do have one thing to say which massively lowered my enjoyment, and that is how it portrayed disability. At the start, it seemed fine, but as the movie progressed, it seemed to literally only be used as a plot device, despite it being a major problem with Josee. It barely came up unless it had to in many parts in the second half, and I feel like the whole idea about that twist (also related to disability) was another plot device to push the romance. Plus, Josee herself was borderline toxic, and I felt like the movie was almost glorifying the fact that she was disabled, and let her get away with anything because of it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I do think this movie could have been way better with only a few very small and simple changes. There were some fantastic emotional climaxes in the movie, especially involving Tsuneo, but some equally low moments that involved Josee or the rest of the cast. I do wish it tackled disability realistically and that Josee was more likeable, but besides that, I feel fairly in the middle about the movie. If you&#039;re into melodramas or maybe even standard drama series, check this out, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend this movie to many other people.
