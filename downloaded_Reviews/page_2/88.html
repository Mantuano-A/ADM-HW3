No tedious philosophies nor pretentious dialogue that solely exists to postpone the battles and extent the awful battle tournament shonen storyline because of pride or other equally laughable reasons. No. This time it&#039;s all about Sakura being too horny to stand and Shirou holding hands with every girl imaginable. Literally sex scenes and masturbation. Now this is what I always wanted from Fate. Finally understand why Heaven&#039;s Feel is the best

        route.<br />
<br />
The pacing can be a problem to some viewers because it is seriously fast and scenes change at ridiculous tempo. There is constantly something happening, twists actually in goddamn fate and people die. Why the earlier anime were even made when something this good was already written I do not know. As a whole, the story is insane and completely fucked up in a good sense.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
No &#039;master this master that&#039; bullshit from the servants. They powerful and have their own will this time around. Sakura literally too horny to stand. Haven&#039;t seen anyone in such heat in the animated medium before, excluding hentai. The countless scenes where she said &quot;senpai&quot; and &quot;humu humu&quot; finally confirmed who is the best girl. Shirou is not afraid of anything I swear and Shinji got owned to hard they should cut him off from other routes. The feelings stuff is neato and for once the series feels genuine thanks to the characters who for once are not either living 100% slice of life or other times throwing some pseudo-intellectual horseshit one-liners no one cares about.<br />
<br />
 Art:<br />
<br />
Slow motion hugging scene in the rain by goddamn ufotable. Prettiest shit I ever saw. Literally can&#039;t wait to see Berserker vs. 2B Saber in blu-ray such badassery and perfect fight. The color pallet is glorious as ever and those animated tentacles piercing ppl&#039;s hearts amazing. And just when I thought it couldn&#039;t do anything more brutal they hit it with mutilation scene by Gilgamesh. The gore is seriously impressive.<br />
<br />
OST:<br />
<br />
Glorious as hell. Flamboyant and atmospheric. Absolutely served the movie. Great decisions were made. Ending song beyond catchy can&#039;t wait for part 3.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Great fucking movie, will buy.

Heaven’s Feel: Lost Butterfly is probably the most sinister and vulgar representation of a survival game that I’ve seen yet. Its structure is completely different from the other two Fate routes. Instead of showcasing that fantastical and epic feeling that the other arcs so expertly portray, the tone of Heaven’s Feel is much more despair inducing and grounded in reality.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299948">
        Characters don’t give grand speeches about their beliefs among other things and don’t always get moments of grandeur, and instead often find themselves dying in abrupt and grisly ways. Primal human emotions like lust and envy are amplified in this adaptation, showing off the impurities of the characters. Despite being a movie embedded with magic and mythological heroes, it never felt wondrous or magical. It instead instilled feelings of misery and dread into me, like a world devoid of the warm caress of light from the heavens. <br />
<br />
Which is exactly how a death battle royale featuring broken characters should make me feel. And I loved every second of it. <br />
<br />
I find it appropriate to start with what I found to be a big highlight of this movie, which would be Sakura Matou, the female protagonist. Heaven’s Feel completely deflowers the typical depiction of an anime heroine. Saber from Stay Night and Rin from UBW are prime examples of ideal heroines. They’re strong, attractive, kind, yet still have some issues that they get over with the help of everyone’s favorite idealistic protagonist Shirou. Plus they’re pretty excellent waifu material if you ask me. Heaven’s Feel takes an entirely different approach with Sakura. She’s much more realistic in that she’s far from perfect and pure. We actually see her masterbate on screen and express her desire to have sex with Shirou, while being disgusted with herself for having such impure cravings. She’s incredibly possessive of Shirou and is clearly agitated at the thought of him being with another girl, most specifically Rin. Her yandere tendencies led me to compare her with the famous yandere from a different survival game that I’m sure every anime fan knows: Yuno Gasai. And although Sakura is like at least 10 times less popular than Yuno, I’d say that she’s a far more engaging and fleshed out character than Yuno is. And that’s all thanks to the excellent portrayal of Sakura’s character.<br />
<br />
Sakura’s story is hella depressing. I’ve always felt bad for her, especially after watching Fate/Zero. Yet my empathy towards her was highly amplified in Heaven’s Feel thanks to her finally taking the spotlight. Her relationship with Shirou was done excellently. It was one of the most legitimate relationships that I’ve seen in an anime. Both characters are broken in their own way, and they rely on each other to keep going. Shirou even gives up on his hero of justice ideal just for Sakura, which I found to be some great development on his part. Though what I find to be the best part of Sakura is her underlying dark nature. I think it was made pretty apparent from the previous movie, but in order to avoid spoilers, I’ll just say that she isn’t as innocent as she seems. Though it’s not really her fault.<br />
<br />
In fact, my absolute favorite moment of the anime would be Sakura’s dream sequence and the aftermath that immediately followed. Using some creative visuals that rivaled the unique animation techniques of Studio Shaft, Ufotable presents a happy dream that Sakura is having where she’s a lovely fairytale princess in a kingdom of wondrous creatures. Yet the entire sequence is quite eerie, and kept me on edge. It culminates with her turning some of the creatures into candy after they were being naughty, and she happily unwraps a piece and eats it. Pretty harmless, right? But the scene that follows is simply chilling. And it was absolutely brilliant. It’s moments like these that made me really appreciate Sakura as a character. In fact, she was excellent in every scene she was in, and I could go on and on talking about her role in Heaven’s Feel. I had honestly never really given Sakura much thought since she was always outshone by the rest of the amazing Fate cast in my opinion, but my views immediately changed after watching this movie. Sakura is a criminally underrated heroine, and she deserves more love. <br />
<br />
Most of the Fate cast hardly get any screen time, especially when compared to previous instillations, and like I said previously, usually just end up dying in gruesome or epic ways after going down fighting, as true heroes should. Since Heaven’s Feel is a group of movies and not a two season anime, I’m perfectly content with this approach. This way the movie can focus more strongly on its core cast of characters. So Saber, Gilgamesh, and others, I love ya, but you need to move over. You’ve already had your time to shine. Aside from Sakura and Shirou, the other character who gets a decent portion of focus would be muh fav loli in all anime (no I am not joking), Illyasviel von Einzbern. <br />
<br />
Illya has a funny, and now that I think about it, only, comedic moment in the anime before everything goes completely crazy. She just never fails to make me smile. I love her relationship with Shirou in this film, and the two of them holding hands was pretty frickin kawaii. There’s also a really great moment where she overhears Taiga talking about how Kiritsugu would constantly go oversees in a desperate attempt to find someone who he dearly cherished, who would of course be his daughter Illya. It’s pretty heart-wrenching because Illya was led to believe that her father had abandoned her, but that was not the case at all. Dem unlimited feels tho.<br />
<br />
I don’t think I need to discuss how amazing the visuals and sound quality are. Ufotable’s animation is the cream of the crop. Fight scenes are done beautifully. The slow motion hugging scene in the rain was one of the most visually appealing things I’ve ever seen. Everything just looks so damn good. And Yuki Kajiura once again composed a heavenly soundtrack. Plus the ending theme song by Aimer is pure epicness. The voice actors are amazing as always. <br />
<br />
Fate has always been one of the most entertaining and well made franchises for me. Yet out of all of the Fate media I’ve watched, none have been quite like Heaven’s Feel. It’s a different experience from what I’m used to, but I absolutely love it. It tells a truly compelling yet tragic tale, and my eyes were glued to the screen while watching. After it ended, I found myself staring at my blank computer screen with unblinking eyes, an accelerated heartbeat, and numerous emotions flowing through me for a minute or two. Yeah, I know that sounds cringy af, but it’s true. I don’t believe that I’ve ever felt the same way after completing another anime then I did with Heaven’s Feel: Lost Butterfly. And let me tell you, I enjoyed every second of it. Can&#039;t wait for movie three!

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
This review will heavily incorporate events that occurred in other works by Type-Moon, so I am going to assume that you are familiar with their other works.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure vast majority of the people who wants to watch this film are familiar with the original visual novel and have some general idea where the story is headed, but just in case you haven&#039;t figured it out, Sakura is going to become full yandere by the end of the film. Not the Gasai Yuno kind of yandere. The good kind of yandere, where the film properly explores the events that gradually transforms

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298808">
        Sakura&#039;s fall from grace and makes her character believable. And that is in fact the key triumph of this film; it is raking in all the emotional weight accumulated from Sakura’s love for Shirou from the first film by crashing her world down slowly. The film does make use of some classical yandere tropes like “confine your boyfriend in the house to protect him from danger” and the “smiles of insanity” to make Sakura’s deadly transformation clear, but it was more effectively told through visually like the static interference happening to Sakura’s body, the ominous shadow that keeps following her, and that one scene where Shirou fearfully tried to ignore the dark presence following Sakura.<br />
<br />
If you are familiar with the collaborative works between Type-Moon and ufotable, then you cannot help but draw the comparison between this film with Kara no Kyoukai chapter 3. KnK came long before Fate/Stay Night was published, so you can tell that Sakura is inspired from Asagami Fujino. They have very similar hair color, extremely similar build, and both are incredibly timid girls who later on go on a rampage, but that is about where the similarity ends. The difference is that in this film, we had an entire 2-hour film prior to this to make us feel invested in Shiro and Sakura’s love story, and also that Shirou has a large influence on Sakura’s humanity, and the outcome of the story depends entirely on Shirou’s decision. There was a certain scene near the end where Shirou had to make a decision about Sakura’s future brought tears to my eyes, because it was a perfect illustration of how much Shirou and Sakura are dependent on one another. Once you realize what Shiro had been up to, it suddenly hits you just how much Shiro is conflicted by his own emotion and his sense of justice.<br />
<br />
That scene also revisited the single key dilemma that characters from Fate series have to explore endlessly. Will Shirou stick with his sense of justice and forsake Sakura, or will he forsake his hero complex and save the one he loves? From the perspective of us audiences, Shirou doesn’t only have his love for Sakura to consider. Abandoning his hero complex means abandoning the legacy that his father (Kiritsugu) left for him, which at this point defines his entire existence. Ten years ago, we saw that Kiritsugu’s sacrifice saved countless lives by preventing the Holy Grail from being fully complete, so Shirou should follow suit, right? It is not an easy decision for sure, but I love it that the film brings new perspective to this theme of justice and sacrifice that Nasu Kinoko has consistently tackled from multiple viewpoints from intertwined characters from different works. I must also applaud this film’s production staff for clearly communicating this theme and dilemma by trimming the fat from the visual novel and treating key thematic scenes with the respectful grace they deserve.<br />
<br />
Now, regarding the technical merits, I will say that the film definitely had large amount of budget to work with, almost to the point of making the producers value quantity over quality. I forgot exactly what happened in the original visual novel, but it felt like the only things happening in the fight scene were explosions. Saber and Berserker also spent a lot of the time jumping from place-to-place and performing mid-air kicks like Rock Lee with five gates opened, so there wasn’t much opportunity to explore the mental state of the fighters. Don’t get me wrong, the animation was certainly gorgeous and fluid, and it also featured this insane sakuga where the camera showed the background of a natural scenery changing from following the movement of a character while showing beautiful animated explosions happening in that same background (the staffs of this film were boasting about this particular scene being the pinnacle of Japanese animation). But these fights feel empty unless we can feel the emotional stake of the fight, which it had none. There was also this scene where Sakura was confessing her secrets near the beginning of the film where Sakura was making so much facial and body movements that it seemed incredibly unnatural. I think this is what animators do when they have nothing better to animate but still want to make the scene look impactful. I am not a huge fan of this. However, not everything was overdone. Ironically, I felt that the art shined the most when there was not much to animate, when the characters were living their daily lives, when silence and calm conversations tells a better story. The music suffered the same problem as the animation. There were a lot of explosive choruses during fight scenes (no pun intended), which sort of distracted me from the fights, but it was haunting and beautiful during gruesome and emotional scenes.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, this is a film that is made for Type-Moon x ufotable fans through and through. You will especially get a lot of out of this film if you have already read the visual novels and have seen all the previous main Fate franchise anime. Ironically, the core hook of this film is its story and characters, which I didn’t think was going to be the case because I just simply didn’t think they would go in such depth in exploring the themes and characters in a humanistic way. The film is gorgeous to look at, but I question some of its animation directions. Like mentioned before, this is a story-focused film, so the best parts come from scenes that don’t involve actions. I will briefly mention here, that the highly anticipated sex scene was given the proper treatment. It was not overdone and it properly articulated the love between the participants. I just thought that you might be interested.

    Once again Ufotable x Type-Moon did not disappoint. Watching it in the cinema (in Japan) with proper loudspeakers can enable me to experience the thrill of this fantastic display of animation choreography. The amount of time and effort by Ufotable once again demonstrates its class in perfecting high-quality animation and its visual arts. The unlimited budget work studio took time off from anime series and dedicate all their resources into this project and came out in fruition, and I could not be prouder for them. <br />
<br />
The movie itself was breathtaking, astonishing and spectacular to watch. I was lost in words walking out of the cinema

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298995">
        as this was one amazing movie adaption to its visual novel source. Despite cutting out, or twisting the moments from its origin was well dealt with to make it as original as possible. The amount of detail dedicated to the colourisation of the background scenery was aesthetic and blends well into the climate of the moment. <br />
<br />
Regarding the fight scenes, the amount of detail to each moment and time-lapse of the fight was well constructed to demonstrate the fluidity of the animation. Not to mention the sounds and background music incorporated fantastically to illustrate the intensity of the battle. I enjoyed the fight scene more compared to all moments.  <br />
<br />
The story building near the end was speechless as the unexpected happened, and demonstrated that Ufotable is willing to go beyond and adapted to the essential character development moment in this movie. Providing us with a much darker twist to the story than the previous routes. My view on Sakura for the past two routes changed entirely after this movie and will play a much more significant role in the final movie. <br />
<br />
Finally, Ufotable did well with the changed in the tone of the last part of the movie from very lively/family oriented moments, and turns into dark/suspense moments, giving us a rollercoaster of feels. But by far, Heaven Feels is now regarded as my most favourite route compared to all routes. <br />
<br />
Hope this convince you to watch the movie.  <br />

    &quot;I&#039;m not a virgin. My first time was quite a long time ago. That&#039;s not all. Ever since that first time, my body has been touched by unnatural things. I don&#039;t deserve to be protected by you!&quot;<br />

 After watching and loving Fate/Zero and then being extremely disappointed with Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works i thought that i would enjoy Heaven&#039;s Feel as i heard it had darker tone and felt more like a true sequel to Fate/Zero, but the only thing that happened is that i remembered that the Fate/Stay Night anime are just the adaptations of a porn game.<br />

 Lost Butterfly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316382">
        tries to be a dark, horrifying and tragic story but instead becomes a great comedy anime, that&#039;s because every scene with Sakura or Shinji are incredibly stupid and made it impossible for me to take them seriously. From the scene where Sakura just masturbates on the ground, to the &quot;i will protect you&quot; scene, to Shinji&#039;s retarded breakdown everything just feels comical when it&#039;s trying to tell a serious story. The biggest example of that is the scene that is used to demonstrate Sakura&#039;s insanity by showing her eating candy in a Disney-like World showing the innocence of her actions and then showing what&#039;s actually happening with her eating a finger of someone she killed, that scene has a purpose and it&#039;s trying to show her insane mentality but just ends up feeling really retarded, impossible to take it seriously and the dream part makes it edgier than it actually is. <br />
 Another problem HF has is that the porn aspect from the VN is way more present than it was in UBW. The Dick Worms, the Sex Scenes and the dialogue make it very clear the nature of the source material and, at least in my opinion, don&#039;t seem to add much to the story other than making funny scenes (when they aren&#039;t meant to be) and making it clear Sakura is REALLY horny.<br />
 As for fight scenes the main highlight is obviously Saber Alter vs Berserker, which feels more like a compilation of explosions and due to that i didn&#039;t enjoy it that much but if you like bombastic fights then you might love it. <br />
<br />
-Characters-<br />
 <br />
 I wasn&#039;t expecting anything like Fate/Zero, with multiple charismatic Masters and Servantes with different ideologies fighting for the Holy Grail to accomplish their own personal goals, but i would&#039;ve liked to see improvements in some of the characters, the main one being Shirou who was a really boring and naive protagonist in UBW. I didn&#039;t get that.<br />
 Shirou: Still boring.<br />
 Rin: Still the typical Tsundere she was before.<br />
 Shinji: Adds nothing to the story and is basically the rapist villain of a Light Novel, giving too much highlight to such a one-dimensional and boring villain that exists for the sole purpose of being hated and maybe adding extra sex scenes in the VN is one of the movie&#039;s biggest mistakes.<br />
 Gilgamesh: The King of Kings, or he was supposed to be, after dying in a ridiculous manner in UBW i at least had expectations that he would be better in this route, but, just like in UBW, he dies in a totally anti-climatic way, can&#039;t believe this is the same guy that defeated Iskandar as if he was a little kid. He was better when he didn&#039;t have any motives and just wanted to have fun.<br />
 Kirei: C&#039;mon, do something...<br />
 Saber: She&#039;s gone, never liked her anyway. Cool design tho. <br />
 Sakura: The Female Protagonist of this Route, she ends up just being a horny yandere, maybe her character would have been better if it weren&#039;t for the cliche romance and the fact that F/SN is a porn game.<br />
 <br />
-Final Thoughts-<br />
 Well, i guess it&#039;s my fault for expecting way too much from the adaptation of a porn game.

    Lost Butterfly is a nightmare. A violent, corrosive nightmare. Gone is the dread that Presage Flower bathed in, as terror strikes in its place. The Holy Grail War is no longer just contaminated, it&#039;s corrupted. All that&#039;s left to do is watch the fireworks as everything goes to hell.<br />
<br />
Once the first scene of the movie finishes giving Shirou a nightmare reminiscent of the penultimate scene of Presage Flower, we start off on a delicate scene. This scene sets off Sakura and Shirou&#039;s tenuous character arcs for this movie, and these arcs allow these two characters to shine brighter than ever before. Shirou&#039;s attempts to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315856">
        with Sakura and be a hero for her in the Holy Grail War without Saber to help him is his most compelling journey across the three Fate timelines. Rarely have we seen him so vulnerable, so determined to keep someone around, so enraged, and so scared. His dreams haunt him, and his enemies test his resolve for Sakura, both physically and emotionally. Sakura&#039;s descent of slowly succumbing to her base desires and losing control of her powers and mental state was, at times, even more exciting. <br />
<br />
No scene encapsulates her journey better than a sequence halfway into the movie where she is seemingly transported to a fantasy land, with adorable woodland creatures playing with her. As she walks along into a castle, we see some of those same creatures along a river, already having drowned. By the end, she is flicking them to death for candy, in a room full of paintings resembling her memories and insecurities, before the film cuts back to reality. <br />
<br />
The rest of the characters are generally decent. Rin coming to terms with the circumstances Sakura is in considering their origins makes for a compelling element to her character. Her tsundere moments are also few, mild, and amusing. It&#039;s also nice to see Ilya coming to terms with issues regarding her dead father. Shinji somehow becomes even more repulsive than his previous incarnations and seeing him get utterly destroyed was priceless. My only real complaint, as well as the last thing I will mention regarding the characters who are ho-hum beyond this point is that Taiga feels almost like an afterthought. She appears for one small scene towards the back-end of the movie to talk to Sakura and inadvertently clear something up for Ilya, and that&#039;s it. Given that she also lives in the place Shirou and Sakura are at, you&#039;d think she would at least be in the background for a few of the more lighthearted scenes.<br />
<br />
Yes, those exist in this movie. The film&#039;s crazy, not miserable.<br />
<br />
Before praising the audiovisuals, I feel I need to go over a few other praises and problems with this movie. Lost Butterfly is much better paced than Presage Flower since it doesn&#039;t have a newcomer-repellant montage at the opening credits of the movie, and it doesn&#039;t have multiple false endings. The lore is still convoluted, with weird explanations regarding &quot;non-canonical/non-traditional&quot; servants and the answers to what that shadow from the first movie was. There is also one scene that is rife with gaudy melodrama, that being the second major interaction between our two protagonists early into the movie. Lastly, while I understand that the film has its fair share of sexual content that&#039;s meant to be perceived as uncomfortable, it does get a bit gratuitous at times. There are a few minor complaints that would delve into spoiler territory, so I&#039;ll leave those at the door.<br />
<br />
Lost Butterfly might honestly be the most gorgeous Fate installment to date. There are a few small moments that look a tad off but they&#039;re nothing compared to the overwhelming might of this film&#039;s visuals. The CGI is better integrated than the previous film, only being used for a few decent CGI cars in the beginning and for some shots of the environment during the Berserker and Saber Alter fight. Said fight is where the visuals reach their peak, with one of the most lavishly animated fight scenes of the year. No expense was spared on showing every detail of the carnage caused by Berserker and especially Alter&#039;s attacks. It honestly rivals the best fights of Mob Psycho 100 II, which came out in the same season as this movie. It’s almost indescribable. Even outside of this fight, the rest of the movie and its fight scenes are still as detailed as you would expect from a high-end Ufotable production. <br />
<br />
Yuki Kajiura&#039;s OST is as good as ever. The one thing I noticed is that there were more chimes in some of these tracks compared to any of her other soundtracks. It continues to suit the Fate franchise perfectly, so there&#039;s not much that needs to be said if you&#039;ve heard her work for the previous film and for Fate/Zero. The film&#039;s ending theme, &quot;I beg you&quot; by Aimer, is probably Aimer&#039;s best anime song to date. It exemplifies the somber terror the film embodies, fitting Sakura&#039;s character arc both with its tone and its lyrics. <br />
<br />
While not the pinnacle of the Fate franchise, Lost Butterfly is an exciting descent into madness. It is easily the most brutal installment since Zero, and somehow the best-looking entry in the series. This film also provides the most compelling versions of Shirou and Sakura to date. As the terror subsides with the end of this movie, all that&#039;s left is hope. I pray that Spring Song caps this trilogy off well.<br />

    Spoilers if you did not read the original 2004 visual novel nor the realta nua version<br />
Spoilers if you did not watch the movie<br />
<br />
Good points:<br />
-The movie was based around the most boring parts of the novel and covered it as fast as it could. Good for the production team. Good for the audience who already read the novel since they can keep up with the fast pace since they already know. Bad for the audience who started with UBW or any of the DEEN adaptations<br />
-The movie seems to have quite the unlimited animation budget<br />
-The female characters are visually appealing to the audience. This is important because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319029">
        the fans of the spin off games of fate/stay night are primarily interested in good looking characters<br />
-Regarding story, this is a fine watch. Alot of major plotpoints happen in this movie, and that will guide the story into movie 3, which will be my favorite part about the entire fate novel adapted into the big screen, so if you&#039;re looking forward to movie 3, this movie will satisfy you, and so will the small trailer that appeared at the end of the movie. This movie did a good job of hyping the audience into movie 3, where the major stuff happens<br />
<br />
Bad points: <br />
-In the novel, sakura has dreams where she is on the POV of the shadow that consumes hundreds of people every night around town. Sakura acknowledges that she knew all this time that she had been killing all those people at night as the shadow and goes along with it in her dreams, only for her to later crumble as she realized she was tricking herself into not thinking about the people she murdered and the harmful thoughts she had in her mind, that was the cause on why the shadow did some of the bad things it did, such as wishing harm on shirou. All of this showed the reading audience an interesting perspective on the sins she did and how she reacted to them, but in this adaptation, they retconned sakura into not knowing she was killing all those people at night as the shadow. They also cut the scene where gilgamesh warned sakura that she should kill herself before she becomes used to being a murderer. This sucks big time, why did the movie makers think this was a good idea or that we wouldn&#039;t notice, or why did they retcon this? I mean, there&#039;s no reason to make sakura not notice the multiple deaths in town nor the fact that she is supposed to see the shadow consume all these people... or is there? It&#039;s clear as day once you consider the only options available to explain this decision. What I am assuming here is that the intention of whoever was behind this movie was to repaint sakura as this sweet innocent girl that did nothing wrong. This is my problem. There are three audiences for Fate. The movie makers did not care to please the casual audience who wanted to watch a good story, nor did they want to please the visual novel readers who wanted an unchanging story from the novel, because there is a third audience that earns them revenue. which is the audience that likes the fate franchise for the cute girls. Having sakura be a bad person could ruin her role as another cash cow anime girl type-moon will use to generate huge revenue, because the waifu loving fans don&#039;t like characters who have imperfections, but rather have sakura be a mary sue who is just a victim of what&#039;s going on around her, rather than have her face the consequences of the actions that she brought onto herself in the original story. I have a problem with sakura getting retconned into not knowing what&#039;s going on nor later realizing that she is the shadow because now she doesn&#039;t have to do much in the story, she&#039;s just the damsel in distress that shirou needs to save in the third movie from the evil influence that&#039;s making her evil. By making her unaware of what&#039;s going on, she&#039;s locked from doing anything that could affect the story because she doesn&#039;t know what&#039;s going on.  I don&#039;t really enjoy characters who previously had personalities being turned into one sided characters in adaptations like these.<br />
-The movie is very vague for its main audience, the people who only watched ubw and fate zero.<br />
-Not enough attention to the other girls from the previous routes, particularly Illya. Some of these characters will get their big spotlight once the last movie comes out, but they haven&#039;t got much attention in movie 1, so you could say that people who are fans of those two girls are forced to not see these characters and instead forced to see sakura be the main girl. All fate girls got alot of attention in the ubw anime, so it can be wierd seeing sakura getting most of the screentime<br />
<br />
Too long didnt read version: Very fast paced, astounding animation, the girls are cute, the movie went along with the hf3 hype, but the movie characters, mostly sakura are one sided, the story is too vague, and the girls you are used to seeing get little screentime

         Heaven&#039;s Feel: Lost Butterfly does a great deal to improve upon Presage Flower and feels like a breathe of fresh air for the Fate/Stay Night franchise. While Presage Flower had to retread some of the ground Unlimited Blade Works and Fate laid, this new film does a lot to show you what is new this time around and the much more intense and dark direction the series takes.<br />
<br />
     One thing I loved about Lost Butterfly is the development of characters that have not yet been given their due in the new Ufotable series. Sakura was clearly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299074">
        established as being the main girl of Heaven&#039;s Feel, and even outliers to the series likely know of her significance, but this film truly fleshes out and cements Sakura as the most tragic and complex of the main female characters in F/SN. Much of the main thrust of this film is fleshing out her and Shirou&#039;s relationship, as well as her (and Shirou) figuring out and dealing with her dark role in this trilogy. On top of lots of great Sakura scenes and development, Illya is finally given some love with some scenes where she&#039;s portrayed as more human than ever before in Ufotables recent adaptations. Both of these characters were highlights in this film and it was great for them to finally have some time to shine. <br />
<br />
    In Presage Flower, Lancer chasing Assassin and their subsequent battle in the swamp was easily my favourite animated sequence of 2017. I&#039;m happy to say that the major battle in this film between Saber Alter and Berserker blows it out of the water. I watched this extended sequence with my hand over my mouth and truly thought to myself &quot;This might be one of the greatest anime fights of all time&quot;. Even though 2019 has just begun, the music, the choreography, the effects, and yes, even the explosions....it all came together to create what I&#039;m almost certain will be the most impressive sequence of the year. I can&#039;t wait for more fans to see it.<br />
<br />
    In addition, while I briefly mentioned it at the beginning, it can&#039;t be overstated how much darker this film is in comparison to the last and even anything to come out of Fate/Stay Night thus far. A particular scene that takes place in an alleyway involving Sakura was a real &quot;shits hitting the fan&quot; moment for the series. The film heavily deals in Sakura&#039;s trauma , showcased through many different scenes and even has what is likely the closest Ufotable will come to adapting any of the sex scenes found in the original visual novel (though it is really quite tame). <br />
<br />
     Overall I had a fantastic time with this film. As much as I loved Presage Flower I think this film stands above it. With where they concluded the film, they&#039;ve allowed for an extreme amount of exciting moments for the final film Spring Song which is releasing in spring 2020. My expectations were met and exceeded yet again and my anticipation for the final film is extremely high. <br />

    I just wanna say, this was a complete and utter waste of my time. Because I had watched Fate/Stay Night and UBW, I had foolishly thought that Heaven&#039;s Feel would be a lot like them, albeit darker. I should&#039;ve noticed when the first movie didn&#039;t meet up to expectations. <br />
<br />
It really feels like the people behind Heaven&#039;s Feel asked, &quot;Hey, so poetic cinema consists of pretty lighting and people staring at each other without saying anything, right?&quot; and no one corrected them. Of course there were some good moments in the movie! But overall, as several reviews have pointed out, this was ultimately an anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362419">
        based on a porn game. I have not played this game, nor do I ever intend to, but I really just wonder. Why? <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s Heaven&#039;s Feel, going all out with the hyper-sexualization of some high schoolers. In my opinion, this absolutely did not add to the plot or the characters at all in a meaningful manner. In fact, I think it destroyed my respect for certain characters, even though it&#039;s very clear that that&#039;s not what it was supposed to do. It was unnecessary and unwelcome for such a person as I, who expected something more along the lines of UBW or Fate/Zero.<br />
<br />
Good points: <br />
Music, still as awesome as always. Aimer must be my favorite singer at this point! And a lot of the music reminded me of Garden of Sinners, which suits the dark tone of this route.<br />
The animation, of course, is also very pretty. I really like some of the sunsets. Lots of nice colors.<br />
I also like the tone, which almost felt more like horror as opposed to a fantasy battle royale.<br />
<br />
Bad points:<br />
Everything else. The pacing felt okay while watching, but looking back on it, I feel like I didn&#039;t really gain anything in the end. What&#039;s going on? What was the plot? Why should I care about these characters? Everything falls apart.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#039;t stop sighing and rolling my eyes throughout the movie as I yelled at characters to stop doing stupid things. I respect Rin, Saber, Rider, and Ilya. Shirou is okay, but he&#039;s still as bland as always, which makes sense considering he was the perspective from which people played in the original game. If he weren&#039;t bland, it would be harder for people to project themselves onto him. <br />
<br />
But Sakura, who&#039;s pretty much the main focus? I liked her well enough, but I simply couldn&#039;t bring myself to stay interested in the development of her role in the plot. So many people also disappeared for the sake of the plot, too. Obviously, in Heaven&#039;s Feel, we&#039;re focusing a lot more on Shirou and Sakura, and yet, two movies down, I really couldn&#039;t tell you how these two characters have developed, or how they are interesting.<br />
<br />
To conclude, this was such a massive waste of my time that I decided to write a review for the first time in my life in order to say how much I hated this movie. I came in with what I thought were reasonable expectations, and I have a pretty low bar for anime in general. I like to be generous when rating things I have watched or read. But this movie went so far below the bar that it dug straight into the ground. I feel bad for Sakura, that she had to be written this way. I really believe she deserved better. Thanks for reading this amateur review written by a severely, irreparably disappointed Fate fan.

    I just saw this movie in theaters less than an hour ago. So I may come back and edited this review after I&#039;ve seen a second time. (If I&#039;ve seen it a second time.)<br />
<br />
I have to say, What was that? And I&#039;m not talking about the animation or the soundtrack. The Credits Song &quot;I Beg You&quot; by Aimer is fantastic, I&#039;m more knocking this for its characters. I feel they relied too heavily on &quot;Because Fate&quot;.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS:<br />
.......................<br />
...................<br />
...........................<br />
..............................<br />
...........................<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as I can recall Saber Alter gets a single line and a single scene. The battle between Berserker and Alter is fantastic when the camera work is kept

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303540">
        simplistic. But they go a bit too dynamic with the shots at certain points. I&#039;m hoping that they explain how Saber became Alter in III because I don&#039;t have access to the original visual novel.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, this is a compressed adaptation. I understand that some things are going to be cut. But there are two things that Shinji does that made go &quot;What does THAT do?&quot; The first is when he breaks an earring Sakura is wearing. It&#039;s quite clearly a power limiter of some sort. I understand that exposition about the whole mechanics of it would have slowed the scene, but you couldn&#039;t have given Rin or Shinji a line naming the earring. The other is this small bottle of purple liquid. It might as well be referred to as  Virtue&#039;s Last Reward&#039;s &quot;Axelavir.&quot; Perhaps instead of that gratuitous scene between Shirou and Sakura that could have been left implied, they could have devoted a scene to giving a brief rundown as to what that bottle contains. What is its name? What are its&#039; properties? With III not due out in theaters for another year, explaining this ahead of time would have been helpful.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m also convinced that the writers in here weren&#039;t on the same page. There had to be one was all about the gratuitous scenes and another who was trying to turn this film into a comedy. Now a laugh or two is fine. But it seems like the whole middle of this film became a comedy sketch. The funny moments that come from Rider acting contrary to how Saber did in the same situation work. The moment where Sakura is staring horrified at a bandaged Shirou is not supposed to be and yet it is! Narm at its finest. The camera angle seems to say &quot;Whomp. Whomp. Shirou got himself injured and brought home two more girls in your sister and the 10 year old. Classic Shirou!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was also at couple of plot points shoved to a single scene. At one point, it looks Sakura is about to go Yandere or at the very least, violently protective. She, at one point, contemplates not letting Shirou leave the house. That plot point becomes dropped when Shirou not only comes from home with two more girls, but leaves the house again. The other single plot point scene comes from a Fujimura flashback where Kiritsugu leaves the house and Fujimura the same way Shirou goes out with Sakura staying home. I found that plot much more interesting.<br />
<br />
They seem to applying equal compression to the plot instead of knowing where to streamline it. Overall, the score on this site is being slightly inflated by the fact that if you&#039;re reaching Heaven Feel&#039;s II you&#039;ve gone through at least one of Zero, Deen, or UBW and Heaven&#039;s Feel I. <br />

    A couple weeks back I looked at the first film in the Fate/Stay Heaven&#039;s Feel trilogy. It was okay. The main issue it suffered was one that seems common to a lot of these Fate anime, Shirou is rubbish. But let&#039;s take a look at the second film and see if it improves at all. <br />
 <br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open where Presage Flower left off. Saber has been absorbed by a strange red and black creature. Shirou is an entire toolbox. Zouken and Assassin are causing major problems. In Lost Butterfly, Shirou and Rin rescue Sakura from her brother, discover some uncomfortable truths about her past, go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399780">
        to Illya&#039;s rescue when the strange being comes after her and Berserker and the identity of the creature gets revealed. <br />
<br />
There are a couple big story problems with the film. The first is that it contains some serious topics like physical, emotional and sexual abuse and it doesn&#039;t really bother to engage with or handle them in a mature, intelligent fashion. Rather, they seem to be here for shock value and as an easy motivation for a particular character. Maybe that changes in the last film and there&#039;s actually some proper exploration and handling of it, but I suspect that won&#039;t be the case. Another issue is that characters give up on their plans really easily for plot contrivance&#039;s sake. There are points where Rin and Shirou are both determined to take action and then give up on those plans very easily. The romance is also very banal. <br />
<br />
Now, to the positives. I do think the film does an excellent job with building intrigue. The reveal of the creature&#039;s nature is very well executed and there is some strong foreshadowing to complement it. So, it is an interesting enough film when it&#039;s not focusing on the relationship betwixt Shirou and Sakura. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s where the film really face plants into a pile of rusty razor blades. The two major characters it spends the most time with are Shirou &amp; Sakura. Shirou is an absolute trash tier protagonist. Annoying, dumb as shit, wears thick plot armour so nothing bad can stick. And Sakura is boring. Here&#039;s the thing, giving a character a very canned tragic back story doesn&#039;t imbue them with a personality or interesting traits. No matter how much ufotable thinks it does. A well-defined back story can be good for enhancing a character and explaining certain facets of their personality but it won&#039;t make a character without depth interesting or complex by itself. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
My biggest issue with the artwork is that the big action sequences have a lot of bright, bombastic flashing lights. I understand what they&#039;re going for. It&#039;s the Michael Bay method of going all out with bright, flashing effects. The problem with this method is that half the action sequence is just bright, flashing lights. It&#039;s not as interesting or as satisfying to look at as, say, an action sequence with a lot of weapon play, punches, kicks and very visceral impacts where you actually see the effects of every blow. A string of massive explosions that take up most or all of the screen just starts getting repetitive very quickly. That aside, the art is nicely detailed.<br />
 <br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Strong actors, nice music. It&#039;s no different from the first film in that regard.<br />
 <br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s none to be found. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Handle your mature content maturely. This is something I&#039;ve talked about pretty extensively, but it continues to be a relevant point. Content like sexual abuse isn&#039;t mature by default just because it&#039;s very serious and you wouldn&#039;t find it in something for young audiences. You have to actually handle it well and engage with it in a meaningful way for it to be mature. And this film, like so many other supposedly mature works, doesn&#039;t bother to do that. It handles it like a fourteen year old trying to be edgy or Frank Miller by throwing it in there with seemingly no reason beyond easy shock value and a misconception that tragic back stories equate to depth. <br />
<br />
2. Your lead characters need to be interesting. You can get by with some side characters being a bit of nothing. But it&#039;s a problem when one of your leads has all the personality of a dried up wad of gum and the other is very clichéd in an annoying way. <br />
<br />
3. Use your explosions sparingly. It&#039;s fine to have some explosions to really punctuate an action sequence, for story reasons or in a major attack. The problem with the way ufotable uses them in this is that they really lose impact when they&#039;re just a consistent part of a very long action sequence. Especially when they fill the whole screen and you can&#039;t see anything else. This doesn&#039;t even take the Dragonball Z route where the explosions are very quick and then you see blurry figures throwing very quick punches and kicks. They&#039;re just long, dragged out explosions. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
This film isn&#039;t really any better than the first. There are still some intriguing ideas, strong visuals and very solid acting. But it continues to suffer from low quality leading characters, story aspects that aren&#039;t handled well and it definitely doesn&#039;t have as strong of action sequences because someone thought it would be a good idea to abuse explosions. I&#039;ll still give it a 6/10. Eventually I&#039;ll get to the last film and hope the pay off is actually worth it and we don&#039;t have the same problem as the last Fate work I looked at where there was some good build up but the ending was rubbish. <br />

    *Spoiler-free review*<br />
<br />
As a reader of the original visual novel, I greatly appreciated the effort put into this movie, especially a certain scene depicting Sakura in an Alice in Wonderland dream, hinting at a very different scene from the original. <br />
<br />
I am certainly biased, and I have rated everything high simply out of me enjoying this movie so much. However, it still had its flaws. For instance, the fact that one of the most plot-heavy routes of Fate/Stay Night didn&#039;t get a TV-series, but rather three movies is wasteful. A positive of it is of course that they were able to adapt it accurately to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348417">
        original without need of censoring, but a dire consequence of that is that it steals away screen-time that could have been used to develop the characters way better, and not making the whole movie seem rushed. This is overshadowed by the brilliant animation and tone of the movie though, in my opinion, but it&#039;s still a flaw that needs to be addressed. <br />
<br />
As for the characters; I loved Sakura and Shirou&#039;s portrayal in this one, but this is largely due to already having a deep understanding of their characters from the VN. Someone who hasn&#039;t read the VN might not pick up on certain character flaws and motivations. For example, Shirou is a way more complex character than a TV series, lest a movie, can accurately depict, as most character development takes place in his head. <br />
There was a particular scene that made me wish they would have gone through the thoughts in his head a bit more throughout it, as his actions were pure stupidity, but the thought process behind it was filled with paranoia and fear. Remove that, and you have an incredibly stupid scene that unfortunately fits TV Shirou.<br />
As for Sakura, her character shines quite a lot during this movie, even if her predicament or certain quotes (&quot;I&#039;m not a virgin!&quot;) may seem like it came out of nowhere for those not entirely acquainted with the Fate series. This is probably mostly a fault in the original writing more than the movie itself, though.<br />
<br />
Another thing that deserves praise is the fluent and gorgeous animation. Everything from the lightning and movements of the characters are beautiful, in my honest opinion. I believe there were two scenes in the entire movie in which a movement felt even slightly off, and that&#039;s after watching it four times. <br />
<br />
All in all, I loved it, and it&#039;s definitely my favorite Fate work so far. It has its faults, but doesn&#039;t everything? I give it a &quot;perfect&quot; score to showcase my enjoyment, but depending on your stance on the Fate series and its characters in general, you might not find it as perfect as I&#039;d like to see it as.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, give it a try! It&#039;s definitely better than its prequel movie.

    Some minor spoilers. But if you&#039;re reading this you pretty know what largely happens in the film.<br />
<br />
I would like to start my review by saying I am not a Fate person. My only exposure to the series was with Fate Zero which I enjoyed quite a bit, and Learning with Manga, but otherwise I am quite apathetic to the series as a whole. That being said, Heaven&#039;s Feel 2 has been one of the most spectacular movies I have watched this year. <br />
<br />
Credit where credit is due, while I have forgotten most of what happened in the first film (the only bits I remembered was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305618">
        Saber falling down at the end and of course Mr.Mapo Tofu/YOROKOBE SHOUNEN), the movie is still relatively easy to understand. While the first film assumed you&#039;ve watched or is at least familiar with what happened in the first two routes, this film only needs that you watch the first film to understand what happens. That said the writing in this is just awful. Never have I experience the entire cinema groaning in unison when Shirou proclaimed his love for Sakura in the most cliched and unimaginable way possible. The writing and dialogue elsewhere is pretty poor too, everything feels so stilted and awkward. With Sakura being one of my least favourite characters owing partly to her personality, but her dialogue feels like a bag of cliches from 10-15 years ago. <br />
<br />
Still, writing issues aside, the underlying story and mystery is fascinating enough to propel the viewer&#039;s interest further. As you see familiar characters being exposed to unfamiliar territory, it&#039;s great to see how they react and respond to the world around them. Adding to this is the absolutely gorgeous visuals and cinematography. While a few of the action scenes can be a bit messy to follow, this film is a definite treat for the eyes, from the quiet scenes to the action scenes, the film pulls off these setpieces so masterfully it makes one forgive the clumsy writing within. Adding to this, Kajiura&#039;s soundtrack is beautifully haunting, giving each scene a surreal and fantastical flair to it. Without spoiling anything, this all culminates in one of my all time favourite scenes in anime, right up there with the Pink Goo scene in Madoka Rebellion. (The scene in question is also very much similar to the aforementioned Madoka Rebellion scene). Everything in that scene is just brilliant, from its placement in the story, to its sharp writing (a rarity in the series) and just how fluid in motion it all is. That scene alone is worth the ticket of admission.<br />
<br />
All in all, the story of a young boy falling in love with a weird girl isn&#039;t much to write about, but the execution of it all, as well as the overarching plot, is simply too fascinating to ignore. Unless Heaven&#039;s Feel 3 crashes and burns, the second film is worthy of a watch and is a marked improvement over the dreadfully boring (but pretty!) first film. <br />
<br />
6/10

    &quot;The bigger they are, the harder they fall&quot;. This statement hold true to almost everything. And with various of recently poor alternative version, Fate! franchise is clearly not an exception. It seems like the greatness of Fate/Zero and the entertaining Fate UBW has forever faded in the shadow of doubts. But fortunately, this time, ufotable has learnt their lessons. Coming back to its root or in this case - route, fan of Fate! finally rejoice. Today, let&#039;s look at the 2nd installment of the highly acclaim action fantasy movie: Heaven&#039;s Fell part 2 - Lost Butterfly.<br />
<br />
This time, you can forget about the master tastics in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316364">
        Fate/Zero and the shounen-ish nature of UBW, hell, even the Holy Grail War is not the focus of the story here. Immersing in a story about Lust and Jealousy, this time our favorite girl Sakura no longer steps aside, she&#039;s so horny and anyone stands in her way to get her beloved sempai, they will regret it. <br />
<br />
Telling a gloomy and depressing story yet keeps it simple, seems like this time Lost Butterfly did many things right. It manages to create tensions and mysteries under the shell of beautiful action sequences. I literally can not keep my eyes from the screen while watching it. And I definitely should be, because the story moved in a very fast pace, you might miss some hint and quite interesting directing way if you don&#039;t pay close attention. One of my favorite part is when Sakura was dreaming about walking with some strange teddy bears like Alice&#039;s Adventure in Wonderland, turns out quite fun.<br />
<br />
This is the most astonishing piece of animation I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. Ufotable did the best job this time. Every movements are so fluid and everything else from the backgrounds to character&#039;s designs like hairs, clothes are beautifully done. Watching this at theater must be a blast, I regret that I can&#039;t watch this at cinema. Along with the charming music composed by Yuki Kajiura, they are a combination of success. Bringing joy and happiness to the viewers. 10/10<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t talk much about the characters since you know pretty much everything about them. How they are and how they will act. Very predictable. Imo, they handle the movie quite well in this show. Putting Sakura and Shirou in the spotlight quite Rin and Saber even Gilgamesh still have their moments.<br />
<br />
Very looking forward to the final part of Heaven&#039;s Feel. The best Fate&#039;s route.

    I am the bone of my sword<br />
Steel is my body <br />
I Have created over a thousand blades<br />
Rho Aias!<br />
The movie is like this segment, just amazing.<br />
Once again ufotable did an amazing job and it is because of masterpieces like this that it is my favourite studio.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story:<br />
Heaven’s Feel: Lost Butterfly is definitely the most sinester/dark route, insted of the other routes heaven&#039;s Feel does not show that epic moment for every character and it as less fantasy. At least for me I could feel the despair in the characters, The pace of the first movie was a problem for me but this sequel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389212">
        was way bether although maybe some people will still not like it.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The art like other Fate&#039;s, Kara no Kyoukai and tsukihime well Type Moon works are incredible. Just name a bether duo than Type Moon and Ufotable, I&#039;ll wait.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
The soundtracks were very good especially in the fight scenes the only thing I didn&#039;t like was the ending.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
For me until now this is the Shirou I like the most, he is more likeble and less anoying, and I can actually understand is points unlike ubw who he is just anoying in some parts and always saying and believing in ideals despite being proved wrong. The character development is as always very good not every usual Main characters gets a lot of screen time but well this is another rote they had their time. I Know i didn&#039;t say anything about Sakura but I really don&#039;t want to say spoilers. All I can say is she is not as inocent as you may think.

    Sempai, Sempai, Sempai? UmU.<br />
Sakura finally getting the attention that she deserves as best girl, this is the second movie so if you haven&#039;t seen that obviously do that first (though keeping things general here so all my points apply to both movies.) <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10- Good art is pretty much expected for Ufotable but this goes above and beyond, I was thinking it was realistic and even cool, but then saber goes and whips out her bloody glassing beam of a sword and my mind is officially blown, considering that I don&#039;t normally care for the art in anime that is a lot. <br />
<br />
Sound:9/10- is in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321023">
        the same ball park, keeping a theme of extreme suspense in every scene, it only scores a 9 because nothing really stood out to me but considering that most of the sound track is there to compliment the mood there isn&#039;t much to be done about that, does what it sets out to do which is perfect.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10- character development done right here it&#039;s not drawn out but adds so much to the backstory of Sakura and rider in particular while also hinting at future developments with the other characters but never gives and exposition dump *cough*fate zero*cough*. by now you know the characters, but this not only builds on but has twists for all of them which I loved.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10- I gave it a perfect score everywhere and so I am really being unreasonable here but the transitions are lightning fast and so if you haven&#039;t seen the first film recently you may be left behind. I have also played the visual novel and while I do think that what they changed was fine and necessary (it&#039;s a 20 long story for just this route at least perhaps longer) I think that a couple of changes cut some charaters from the story, Zoken is sidelined and while Kire the priest has an important role there is a lot more that he could have done that wouldn&#039;t have particularly added to the run time and is incredibly important to his character.<br />
Basically watch it sempai...

    This is the first time anything has made me want to write a review and ill just jump right into it ( minor spoilers ahead)<br />
<br />
<br />
I love the fate franchise so far. This is a very unique story with so many well written characters whether you like them or hate them. But there&#039;s one reason i wanted to share my opinion on this movie. The constant need to show and tell about the dark side of Sakuras past and present. I understand what she is being used for and i have no qualms about that, i understand that fate was originally an eroge visual novel. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411818">
        the constant need to show and talk about Sakura being abused sexually really stroke a nerve with me. The fate series has been changed to not be eroge or ecchi in any way in the ufotable anime adaptation. this is the first time we see actually sex scenes in the fate series since Zero, and i hated it. I personally feel like it halts the story to a fault. In this movie with amazing sound design, animation and fight scenes the sexual assault and consenting sex scenes fell like the almost dont belong. I was having a blast with this movie up untill the message became sex is the only was to convey a characters emotions. I know this review is probably bad and i dont get my point across well but i just cant shake of this disturbed feeling i have after watching this movie. A series that was so good with its story telling and actions scenes was halted for some horrible explanation of a characters inner most feelings in the most primitive human way possible. I wish i enjoyed this movie but i feel like i left it more uncomfortable that anything else. This was definitely not the way i wanted this amazing series to go in and i hope the next movie can bounce back and come back to what fate is actually about at least within the anime adaptation.

    ATTENTION THIS CONTAINS SPOILER side note: this is the review for the both movie lol<br />
so I watched this at Akiba Pass Festival so I&#039;m quite late on writing review on it but hey I remember what happened and since this is my first review please endure and keep reading<br />
<br />
Story(9/10):<br />
so, heaven&#039;s feel movie, a dark path of fate series in here we see same characters but not quite, in here we see more of the characters interact, example: illya and shirou, sakura and tohsaka with different mid-end<br />
which I really enjoyed<br />
but something bothers me every time is saber getting out of control of shirou (pshh) rin: let&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304318">
        team up. but these are not the real problem here it&#039;s the rape scene which is typical in this modern era of anime (was it supposed to be longer?)<br />
<br />
<br />
art(10/10):<br />
everything about it is perfect but there is something that fucking bothers me is their goddamn nose I just can&#039;t stop looking at it well w.e since this is not a real problem, we&#039;re here for the fight scenes <br />
<br />
<br />
sound(10/10):<br />
fight scene sound effects were perfect and so in time, in kind of felt like I was in that scene (or maybe I&#039;m not used to thearte speaker)idk what I&#039;m talking about<br />
<br />
character(8/10):(spoiler damnit)<br />
hmmm shirou still has his idiotic desire kiritsugu, but what bothered me the most, THAT HE didn&#039;t do it don&#039;t get me wrong I didn&#039;t want him to kill sakura but that was out of character, if it was kiritsugu he wouldn&#039;t give it a second thought and straight bomb the whole damn house to kill her.<br />
 not much to say about other *side* characters lol (cuz I&#039;m too lazy perhaps)<br />
enjoyment(10/10): <br />
but hey I enjoyed it especially that epic fight scene (saber and berserker)<br />
overall 10/10 <br />
if you read till here without skipping you should see doctor, that&#039;s not normal man.<br />

    I will start this review by stating I will avoid major plot spoilers and discuss the events vaguely as to not spoil anything but will discuss character developments;<br />
<br />
Firstly, this movie was one of my favourites in the fate series and I am very glad I had the opportunity to see it in theatres. I am a fan of darker and sad stories and this certainly fits right into that genre. While I believe many will be discussing the more heavy focus on sexuality in this film I would like to focus on other elements and only touch on the sexual elements to say that it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303565">
        was done well and did not take away from the core plot or feeling of the film. The scenes were enjoyable and honestly rather touching when you view them as more than simple fan service, and instead as a way to express the true desires of the characters and the meaning that it holds for each of the protagonists. Sakura has a sad past, so, it is not surprising that she would so dearly and with much desire, seek out someone who cherishes her and seeks to protect her. On another note, one downside of this arc of Fate is that it heavily requires knowledge of the other routes to make sense of the film. This is not necessarily a fault but it is still true nevertheless. Most likely this is due to time restraints.<br />
<br />
Story/Plot: 8<br />
As mentioned previously I like stories that make you feel for the characters and this movie does that very well. The story of Sakura Matou is a dark one and the way in which they portray her, her experiences, and the effect that it has upon her is honestly amazing and one of the strongest points of the film. Her dream scene, for example, showing an absolute contrast of pure innocence and evil was very well done and while furthering the plot it also further personified Sakura in my eyes.<br />
<br />
The pacing of the events does not feel so fast as to be unnatural but it is also not necessarily slow either. I have not played the VN, however, I am aware that much inner dialogue and &#039;downtime&#039; was cut to streamline the film. While some may view this as an inherent deficit; I do not view it the same. Perhaps if I had played the VN I would not be of the same opinion but as the film is right now I feel as if the core elements that needed to be there were there. However, that is not to say that this movie is not a little confusing even for someone who has seen all of the other fate adaptations.<br />
While part 2 answers some of the questions we had in part 1 it still leaves much unanswered and unclear to the viewer. The goals of certain characters and the way in which the grail functions in this war is still rather unclear. However, as this is only part 2 I cannot fault the movie on this as we still have part 3 that may provide clarification to many of these unanswered questions we have.<br />
<br />
One slight complaint I do have with the story is the situations Shirou keeps getting himself into that always involve Rin &amp; Archer having to come to his aid. I do not wish to be more specific than that to avoid spoilers but it was a little bit annoying knowing that probably no matter the situation he would charge into it will be resolved the same way. This is only a minor issue and I could not find any major issues with the plot. The true time for in-depth plot analysis will be when part 3 is released so that we may indefinitely conclude on what is lacking and how it could have been done better in the earlier films as well.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
Unlike much of the Fate Series, this route does not focus on servant - servant or servant-master relationships as much as it does the main masters of the series. We learn little of the servant&#039;s desires and honestly hardly hear from them at all. While some might characterize the Fate Series for simply the servants in it I believe this approach to further flesh out the masters is a great one that was done very well. Naturally, the most fleshed out character, Sakura, was done extremely well. As previously mentioned her dream scene not only furthered the plot but showed her inner idealized innocence in contrast to the greater outer evil. This was an extremely memorable and impactful scene for me. Her greatest development is likely her own perception of herself that changes over the course of the film with the help of Shirou. From a tainted object to be used and abused she starts seeing herself as someone who can be loved. Truly a touching development; but not one without a catch, such is the intense desire to be loved and belong that follows<br />
<br />
Shirou, our other main protagonist, alongside Sakura can be seen as two broken parts trying to fit together to be one again. It is sad. It is tragic. But, it was done well. The internal conflict within our characters at many points in the film showed their true desires in active conflict with their idealized versions of themselves. Shirou, the hero of justice, and Sakura, the innocent girl. The conflict of these desires and their ideals and wishes to protect one another gave a depth to the characters that I had not expected when compared to the other Fate adaptations which seemed to follow a righteous path in comparison to Heaven&#039;s feel which does not mind dirtying its hands to produce a great story.<br />
Both approaches are fair, however, the dark reality brought upon by the cast and story of Heaven&#039;s feel is a great change and delivers a great story with protagonists you can truly feel for.<br />
<br />
Illya! Everyone&#039;s favorite loli. In this film, she is mostly seen as comic relief but has her moments as well later into the film as well. I would have liked to see her given a little more time to flesh out her place in this film, but if that would mean less time for the two protagonists then I cannot complain. She is still given some serious parts in addition to her silly and adorable segments too. Tohsaka is given a bit of time as well as I mentioned in the plot section but does not play as significant a role as our other two protagonists. But, don&#039;t be sad Tohsaka fans. She is still given quite a bit of screentime.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Let me begin with why this score is not higher. I truly would have loved to give this a 9 for the absolutely amazing scenes between Shirou and Sakura that truly enhanced the film overall. The atmosphere, characters, and feelings were all conveyed very well through the art and various absolutely stunning scenes. But, unfortunately, I cannot. While those scenes among many others make this a very strong 8 the certain elements of the fight scenes make it hard to justify a 9 or higher. Please do not interpret me as saying the fights were bad as they absolutely were not. However, during some fights, it would simply turn into a show of solid colors flashing across the screen and focused far too much on wide scale destruction as opposed to the fight itself. I had this same complaint with Fate / Apocrypha but it seems to be here to a lesser extent in comparison.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is simply my opinion but I prefer to see an epic fight than be impressed with a plethora of flashing colors and destruction. I also believe the general choreography of fights was stronger in other Fate Adaptations. But, with that being said this Arc does not seem to focus as much on fights as it does the characters so this is not a major fault. Overall, the art was still VERY GOOD and with scenes being simply superb. I am very impressed and pleased with the art.<br />
<br />
Music: 7 EDIT: 8<br />
While the music of this film was good, it was not as good as other routes that I may have given an 8 to. All the scenes went well with the music and I never found fault with any music. However, it did not feel as if it impacted me as much as it had in previous films and not enough to justify a higher rating. The music is by no means bad, I am giving it a 7 after all, but it is not a key feature that stands out in this movie. Especially in comparison to the other elements I have discussed.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I have since really started to love these songs months later<br />
<br />
Overall;<br />
Whether you&#039;re a fan of Tohsaka, Shirou, or Sakura, Heaven&#039;s Feel is a great addition to the Fate series. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely yes. If you are a fan of the Fate Series / Nasuverse you will absolutely enjoy this. You will enjoy it even more if you can accept a more heavy/dark plot than the other routes have taken. This is a story that I have been waiting for, and am glad it is being told as well as it is. I, along with probably many of you, eagerly await Part 3!<br />
<br />

    Much like a crest worm devouring spirit for mana, it grows into that of a lost butterfly, devouring humans for the Holy Grail...<br />
<br />
Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven&#039;s Feel - II. Lost Butterfly was not what LA was expecting, like some serious Cerberus syndrome effect kicks in as well loose plotline presented in presage flower is...well given &#039;bloom&quot; as it. Lost Butterfly fully embraces Sakura Matou&#039;s route and gives us NO WAY back with all the consequences Shirou&#039;s decision has take him into.<br />
<br />
Lost Butterfly takes place after the events of presage flower where Saber gets taken in by this &quot;shadow&quot; and has now gone missing, all the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317130">
        while Shinji is out on the loose and it just gets worse from there...<br />
<br />
Lost Butterfly by all means centers NOW on Sakura, though hinted at in presage flower, Sakura takes centre stage in the what is the buildup of Heaven&#039;s Feel as we see Shirou take on her route all the while dealing with Shinji, Zouken and whatever the shadow that infected Saber is still out on the loose. We get LOTS of development from Sakura, from her proper mindset and her odd behaviour towards Shirou and with Shirou fully embraces Sakura&#039;s route, well romance adds in as it were. So it&#039;s smooth sailing for Shirou and Sakura right?, defeat Shinji and Zouken and all is well...well...<br />
<br />
First thing is first, Sakura as character is greatly developed, be it with her interactions with Tohsaka and FINALLY letting it be clear that their sisters (as the other routes only skimmed this point), with all the events that happened in Lost Butterfly Illyasviel helps Shirou with the shadow and with the increasing threats to Shirou and thanks to Saber missing, Shirou is in even more danger, so with Tohsaka and Illyasviel staying at Shirou&#039;s house and Shirou taking in Sakura when she had nowhere to go...Tohsaka and Illyasviel might take Sakura&#039;s place in Shirou, that of a &quot;lover&quot; with Tohsaka and &quot;little sister&quot; with Illyasviel...making her lost. But not only that but with the odd behaviors and latter on the plot twist with her (to be expected, it&#039;s her movie now) she&#039;s lost...thus lost butterfly.<br />
<br />
To Shirou&#039;s end with Shirou taking up Sakura&#039;s route and fully embracing it, Shirou has a rather tearful moment with Sakura and the interpretation can be taken in two ways for LA..or both, that of betrayal, the simple one is in betraying Sakura&#039;s promise, the much more deeper one...being that of Shirou betraying his promise with Kiritsugu of the belief of protecting everyone by killing one (yeah something Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya Movie: Sekka no Chikai&#039;s alternative Shirou ALSO took on and heck even Kiritsugu at the end of Fate/Zero did the same thing!)<br />
<br />
With the mass shuffling of characters and the &quot;point of no return&quot; looming, like LA aforementioned above, Illyasviel and Tohsaka though having less screentime to Sakura, they got some, with Illyasviel and Tohsaka both being support to Shirou and mainly healing Shirou whenever he gets heavily injured, but Tohsaka gets some sisterly bonding time with Sakura and Illyasviel talks things with Shirou about Kiritsugu and finally giving her some resolutions to Kiritsugu as a father in the process, so even with all things worsening plot-wise, character wise, the main cast gets some much needed development.<br />
<br />
The animation once again done by ufotable...well can LA say it, GOD LIKE as per usual with the perfect blend of amazingly well detailed character designs and fluid choregraphy that does get rather batshit crazy with how well detailed it gets. The CGI was pretty much disguised with how well it blende din with the traditional animation. The crisp and sharp character designs, the god like seamless battles and add in the fact that Lost Butterfly uped the amount of gore and blood from presage flower and it&#039;s completely uncensored and well what else but...ufotable did it AGAIN and they clearly poured their souls into the animation for this one.<br />
<br />
The voice cast...easy MVP&#039;s, since Sakura has taken centre stage...Noriko Shitaya for all Sakura went through just DAMN Noriko was great as Sakura. Of course the rest of the cast reprises their roles, with Noriaki Sugiyama as Shirou, Kana Ueda as Tohsaka Mai Kadowaki as Illyasviel, Hiroshi Kamiya as the bastard asshole Shinji and Junichi Suwabe as Archer, Jouji Nakata as Kirei. The old Fate stay night voice cast is back and as crystal clear, almost bewitching as ever cadences from all of them.<br />
<br />
Lost Butterfly goes to the deep end with Sakura&#039;s route and really won&#039;t let go of Shirou and LA just loves the entire dichotomy of Shirou and Sakura&#039;s relationship, if Shirou and Saber&#039;s route is that regrets of the past and looking to the future, Shirou and Tohsaka&#039;s route being that of looking at the present, then Shirou and Sakura is that of betrayal and having no future. Lost Butterfly beautifully intertwines Shirou and Sakura (not in that way) predicaments together, greatly develops them as characters, their relationship and drives their bloody and dark plot forward to endgame of Shirou and Sakura&#039;s route be it good or bad, things are getting crazier from here on out...and LA can&#039;t wait for the endgame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does the world around me...hate me&quot; - Sakura<br />
<br />
But only a Spring Song can give Sakura a future...
