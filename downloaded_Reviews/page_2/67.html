    Ping Pong The Animation is an exceptional show. This is less of a sports anime and more of a powerful emotions series. It&#039;s a beautifully crafted coming of age story and one that certainly doesn&#039;t come along often. In a word, it&#039;s unconventional. Nothing about Ping Pong feels ordinary so love it or hate it, it&#039;s hard to not recognize its artistic merit. <br />
<br />
The story is a simple one and it chronicles the lives of two boys and their experiences with table tennis. We&#039;re introduced to Makoto Tsukimoto, aptly nicknamed &quot;Smile&quot;, and his boastful best friend Yutaka Hoshino, or &quot;Peco&quot;. These two are polar opposites

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147553">
        and we follow them through their high school ping pong careers. Their story is told in just 11 episodes and it&#039;s nothing short of pacing perfection. Everything meshes wonderfully from start to finish and each episode provides just the right amount of information without overwhelming or confusing the viewer. Ping Pong is great at giving you important plot points piece by piece and this makes it an incredibly engaging experience. Each episode is satisfying and this makes it very tempting to marathon. <br />

This is where things start to get shaky for the average anime viewer. The art style is simple and misshapen. There are no enormous and colorful eyes. The lines are crude and uneven so things like ping pong balls aren&#039;t perfect circles. It&#039;d be no exaggeration to say this is some of the most unorthodox art in the industry today, but by no means is it bad. It may be out of the comfort zone, but it&#039;s fitting for what the show is trying to do and it has an inexplicable charm to it. The animation is quite weak at times and things just look sloppy. This actually works to the show&#039;s advantage by providing a unique style of its own. The art and animation stay consistent the whole way through. If this bothers you, get out while you still can.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to believe a show about ping pong has music as good as this. The sound sets the mood perfectly. From simple melodic tunes while training to the adrenaline pumping opening song, Ping Pong knows just the right track to play at every given moment. A handful of tracks feel a bit out of place, but as a whole, it feels like watching one long movie. Additionally, the music is very good at distorting one&#039;s perception of time. There are times where it goes completely silent to emphasize the strain on a character. You may even associate certain songs with certain characters and this is a very good thing because it means you&#039;re connecting with them. <br />
<br />
Where Ping Pong really shines is its characters. The amount of development in such a short time is staggering. The interactions between characters are astoundingly genuine; every conversation feels natural. There&#039;s meaningful growth in even the most unlikely people and this is a breath of fresh air from shows where nothing seems to change. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to go into too much detail regarding individuals, but the rivalries between characters are beautifully illustrated. Their personalities bounce off of each other in a frighteningly realistic way. The harsh reality of athletics is painted not only on their faces, but also on their words. A lot of conversations later on are poignant and almost poetic. It&#039;s tragic at times and these interactions do a great job of maintaining the morbid realism that made the early episodes special. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong is not a light watch. This is something that can be enjoyed by anyone who wants a good story. You don&#039;t have to like or even understand table tennis, it&#039;s first and foremost a tale about growing up. It&#039;s undoubtedly a memorable experience and something very much worth your time if you keep an open mind.

    It&#039;s a rarity nowadays to find many series or studios willing to take risks. Much of the anime industry has taken to fan-service oriented pandering and it&#039;s left me craving for something new. Something that can blow me away with it&#039;s creativity and unorthodox presentation. Utilizing its unconventional style, fantastic character development, symbolism, and occasional moments of witty dry humor, Ping Pong The Animation is that something.<br />
<br />
When I first started this series I had low expectations. How could a series about ping pong be any good? It seemed like the flop of the season. Fortunately, I have never been so wrong. Despite its appearances of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150803">
        being a simplistic show about playing table tennis, Ping Pong had a surprising amount of depth. Like any other sports anime, the series focuses on pushing the story forward by using the game as it&#039;s major plot device. However, unlike many other sports anime, Ping Pong takes a more believable, realistic style. There is no feeling of unrealistic, over-the-top antics like you might see in Prince of Tennis, nor is there an unbeatable Gary Stu like you&#039;d see in One Outs. Ping Pong is simple, yet complicated. Messy, yet also clean. Realistic, yet unbelievable, all at the same time. <br />
<br />
Another thing the series does well is keeping the audience interested in the strategies, style, and skill that ping pong requires as a sport without seeming boring or tedious. In this series the games themselves also aren&#039;t simply just games. Each game portrays something akin to a soliloquy or inner monologue for at least one character. It props the characters up and pours color into their black and white hand-drawn cutouts. If you can feel the inner turmoil, anguish, happiness, and sadness just by watching two people hit a ball back and forth across a net on a small table, then you know you&#039;ve watched something special. <br />
<br />
Of the few reasons people may dislike this series, the art and animation style will likely be the one. Ping Pong has a sort of rotoscope, flip-book type of style. At times it looks like a sketch or unfinished work, but it works so well for this series in particular. It&#039;s strange, but also charmingly unique. The games of table tennis seem so fluid and realistic that it sometimes feels like I might be watching people playing the game live right in front of me. It feels like a perfect match. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong delivers on the sound criteria just like any other. The beginning of the series didn&#039;t feel quite complete since it was missing its real opening, but the timing and placement of each sound felt spot on. It&#039;s easy to tell that the attention to detail is there. The opening will get you hyped for the episode and the ending will simmer you down. They compliment each other very well. The soundtrack, overall, is great.<br />
<br />
The two main characters of the series are Tsukimoto, &quot;Smile&quot; Makoto and Hoshino, &quot;Peco&quot; Yutaka. Despite being polar opposites, these two characters mesh together other with ease. Smile takes the role of the passive, quiet, and soft-spoken character, versus Peco, the energetic, loud, and cocky personality. They act as yin and yang in the series. While the main story is about these two, their friendship, rivalry, and camaraderie, it also takes the time to give the supporting characters their turn in the spotlight. All characters, whether it be the main or supporting, are dynamic and, as the series progresses, grow based on their experiences. Characters who come to realize their faults, and begin to instigate change to better themselves, are a rare occurrence in anime, yet Ping Pong is no stranger to utilizing the unordinary and implementing it with finesse.<br />
<br />
Although Ping Pong The Animation may be a more serious, somber sports series, it&#039;s easily a worthwhile watch for any audience. It&#039;s a shame that Ping Pong didn&#039;t quite get the attention it deserves. Despite being one of the most under-appreciated series from the Spring &#039;14 season, it was truly a diamond in the rough. If you give it a bit of your time and a little polish I guarantee that it&#039;ll shine for you as it did for me.

<br />
From time to time, a show will be despised by some for the unorthodox and uncommon mediums of presentation and execution. I hold the notion that Ping Pong The Animation truly uses its unorthodox way with great triumph and success. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong The Animation is set in a local Japanese town and portrays the lives of two young boys in the local table-tennis club. Having an innate talent for the sport, Makoto Tsukimoto, nicknamed Smile, and his close friend Yukata Hoshino, nicknamed Peco, are depicted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148643">
        as two ordinary Japanese males with hidden latent potential in the sport they play derived from their distinct and individual traits and personality. Both these characters have their own unique play style differing from another and is manifested clearly throughout the course of the show, whether they be panels popping up on the screen in sync with the sounds of the ping pong balls colliding with the table or the motion of their movements in matches. <br />
<br />
Both Smile and Peco have their own memorable characteristics and qualities. Smile is shown invariably depressed and has no interest in the sport itself whether it be for competitive of leisure play. Instead, his raison d&#039;être for being in the club is to merely kill time in his depicted pathetic life. Be it the monologues of Smile to the stoic and emotionless quality of his, he is still shown as a likable character with genuine qualities. Despite hiding away his emotions, it is made evident towards the audience that he does in reality portray a sense of morality and his own set of beliefs and attitudes especially during and after the match against Wenge Kong, an extremely skilled foreign table-tennis player from China recently abandoned by his home team in China. Nicknamed China himself, Kong is another unique member of the cast in Ping Pong The Animation as it gives a national sense of diversity towards our main Japanese cast. Not only this, but we are also able to have an insight of players from foreign countries besides Japan as well as their individual used play styles and capabilities. Despite coming from China, the country where table tennis plays a fundamental role as one of the country&#039;s highly-acclaimed sports, Kong is not displayed as the archetype of overpowered-ness. Instead he is more or less portrayed as a tragic hero, as he comes to learn that there are many other great and exceptional players throughout the world and this adds on to his development as a character. Peco dreams to be a champion in the sport and is portrayed as an arrogant and talented player, as well as the epitome of liveliness as he is constantly engaged and is energetic in the sport he loves. He is almost portrayed as the antithesis foil of Smile as unlike Smile, Peco has a true passion towards table-tennis and tries his best. Other supporting characters worthy of mention would be the coach who constantly supports and drives Smile to play to his best knowing that he has a growing innate and hidden talent for table-tennis and will not realise it until he conquers some of his prime weaknesses, holding back against opponents and hindering the definition of true sportsmanship.Not only do these characters amaze me, but so do the support characters. Obaba, or the Tamura Lady is Peco&#039;s sensei from the table-tennis hall. As Peco repents and changes as a person who wants to regain his dream of becoming a ping-pong champion, both of them develop their relationships too and more memorably by the line of &quot;love ya&quot; till the point even Peco says it to Kazuma, also known as Dragon. <br />
<br />
Dragon, or Kazama is a well-known champion and paradigm of hard work and strength throughout the show. Represented by the mythical specie Dragon, Kazama portrays strong intellect and hard work with extreme effort devoted into table-tennis. Despite all of this has contributed into his overall power and making him stand as number one, he does not understand one thing about table-tennis. That one thing is having fun or just enjoyment in general, and because of this, he does not have the potential Peco has to become everything he wants to or can be. <br />
<br />
Akuma is another great side character who has underwent extreme change. After always tailing behind Peco in their childhood table-tennis life, Akuma finally regains more of what he wanted to be when he played against Peco. He acts as a symbol for hard work, while Peco at first is a symbol of talent, until Peco also attains hard work and having fun in the latter half of the anime as he understands that they are necessary components for success. KAs the anime progresses, all the characters, Smile, Peco, Kong, Kazama, and Akuma undergo heavy amounts of character development and mature as human beings, changing the way they act as well as their mindsets and just shows how much ping-pong as a sport can bring to anyone. <br />
<br />
Now regarding the art and animation, this is where critics place there hands on. Arguably having low budget visuals, many don&#039;t know that the manga&#039;s art is similar in its own essence and that the adaptation is attempting to be faithful to its source material. Taking this into consideration, the visuals can be seen as amazingly stunning and captivating to say the least. I think that this artwork is what brings the best execution from the show itself and using other high-budget and more modern and common forms of artwork would not bring out the same excellent effects this unique art offers. Backgrounds are detailed and facial expressions are clear most of the time. Specific camera angles and pop-up frames are used to their best extent during matches and the pop-up frames in sync with the music and the bounces of the balls all amalgamate to show synergy in its execution. This realistic approach from the art is what truly makes Ping Pong The Animation such a great success thus far. Getting used to the artwork is in fact not difficult at all, a few episodes and I&#039;m almost entirely  sure one can get used to it and understand its intrinsic beauty. <br />
<br />
The sound in the show is the paradigm of excellence. The opening song itself sets the stage for the incoming episode and circulates adrenaline around the viewer&#039;s body, wanting the music to last forever. The ending song closes each episode well, and leaves the watchers ready for the incoming previews as well as setting the scene by showing visuals of the town itself. The ost is phenomenal, it utilizes the rock genre to its pinnacle especially during the matches. Likewise, the ost also manages to regularly captivate the audience by matching with the animation during the games. Regarding the voice acting, a worthy mention is definitely Kong, or more known as China. The foreign voice actor is an aspect that also contributes into making China such a remarkable character as not only is it realistic, but not many anime you see nowadays utilize voice acting to the point where foreign voice actors are hired for the job. As the story progresses Peco&#039;s voice becomes a great voice to just hear into your ears. His enthusiasm and motivation and even his raison d&#039;être is shown by his vehement voice actor and I am well sure that Peco and Smile&#039;s persona would be different without the utilisation of the same voice actors. Smile&#039;s voice does not change as the story progresses, but his tone does as he changes as a person. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong The Animation is definitely worth the watch as I enjoyed every minute of the show. The show utilizes innovative and unorthodox mediums and amalgamates the visuals, the sound, the story, as well as characters to their zenith. Give yourself the opportunity to engross yourself into the successful show Ping Pong The Animation is of today.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing to lose and regret for watching it, but by not watching it, you lose the experience to touch upon this intriguing and exquisite show. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong The Animation has taught me many prominent values in life. Hard work....talent....and having fun.....these three constituents are all important ingredients that some people will always have more than others and no one can become the best player out there in the world with merely heavy amounts of hard work but having no fun at all. If you want to do well in something, you have to enjoy it. Don&#039;t envy those who significantly have more talent and power in them, strive for that power yourself by hard work and effort. But most importantly, remember to have fun and enjoy the time you spend in the sport. <br />

    I recently reviewed something and gave it praise for the narrative it was able to achieve in 13 episodes. I can’t help but share that sentiment in regards to what Ping Pong is able to accomplish with its 11 episodes. A transformation story from angsty adolescence to enlightened and matured adults, Ping Pong goes well and truly beyond the generic confines of the sports genre illustrating a beautiful narrative of complex emotional growth and maturation, truly cementing its place as a modern classic. <br />
<br />
It wouldn’t be a stretch to call Masaaki Yuasa a genius. Those who have been exposed to his past works will understand

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189387">
        that his left wing approach goes completely against the grain and standard expectations of animation by today&#039;s standard. Combined with the fact that his works are highly intelligent, often profound and filled with a philosophical depth Yuasa earns his place at the pinnacle of the industry. And here he is again. After Mind Game. After Tatami Galaxy. Yuasa has returned bellowing from above, telling us once again that life is simply worth living. That despite anything that happens in one&#039;s life, there is always a reason to push on. That in and of itself, is what Ping Pong is truly about. Living. Living life to its fullest, enjoying every twist and turn it brings. <br />
<br />
“We’re alive, that’s why we’re happy!”<br />
<br />
Understanding that, its no surprise that the characters, above all else, make Ping Pong truly special. They are the driving force of the series. Genuine, believable and one way or another it is likely for their emotions and struggles to resonate with the viewer. These character’s are not perfect, they are flawed, burdened and they struggle. The hero of the story - Peco - is so full of hot air and arrogance at the beginning that once he is brutally beaten by someone worlds ahead of him, and by someone he once thought was beneath him, he falters and loses hope almost giving up on the sport he has loved his entire life. Yet it is his inevitable acceptance and reinvention of himself that results in not only his transformation to maturity, but also the transformations of those he meets along the way. <br />
<br />
Similarly, Kong Wenge finds himself in a comparable position, being ostracized from the national Chinese team, he finds himself in egotistical ignorance like Peco, thinking he is above everyone else. It is only through his acceptance after playing with Peco that Kong evolves and is truly able to succeed. Kazama sacrifices everything in an attempt to maintain his family and club’s status. Ping Pong is simply a means to an end for Kazama. Through his match with Peco, he finally learns to let go of his burdens, to play for himself, no longer seeing the sport as a mandatory duty. Through exposure to the hero Kazama also transforms not only being able to enjoy the sport for what it is, but also his life. Yet no transformation is more rewarding or majestic than Smile’s. Peco finally breaks Smile’s robot shell in their final match and for the first time since he was a child, he smiles. <br />
<br />
Its understandable that the art deters individuals. By no means will everyone like it, it is far from mainstream but there is reason for everything that is drawn and animated. I am certainly bias when it comes to Yuasa’s art, it reminds me of older series, back when things were largely hand drawn, they felt genuine. Now everything seems cold and straight and lacking any warmth or sincerity. And for the majority that’s probably fine. That bias aside, I believe Yuasa’s eccentric art compliments the series brilliantly. The genuine art resonates with the genuine characters and their plethora of emotions and complications. A wide range of cinematography techniques and symbolism are used to emphasize the deeper aspects of the series. What makes Yuasa’s art truly special is they way he is able to use this symbolism to highlight certain aspects, such as the armor breaking away as Smile is playing against Peco in the finale, this signifies both visually and metaphorically that he truly has transformed. The artistic style is truly limitless in what it is able to illustrate, which is why I truly believe Yuasa’s art to not only be aesthetically beautiful, but also carry depth.<br />
<br />
Just like the art, Ushio’s OST is equally synergistic to the series. The score has a wide range of sounds and tracks that have a wide variety of applications for all emotional ranges and actions. Just like the art, there are many tracks on the OST that go beyond an enjoyable listening experience, which is to be expected when it comes to any high quality score. The “Hero Theme” is not only a phenomenal composition, but the use of it really exhumes raw emotion, it is engaging to listen to and it harmonizes well with what is transpiring. Smile’s “Monster” theme really reiterates the robotic personality he has. Ultimately, the OST has a brilliant atmosphere that only strengthens the series. Not only this but both the sound effects and editing are done phenomenally, nothing sounds out of place.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong reaches a standard very few anime will ever reach. Driven by flawless characterization, a beautiful story of growth, maturation and life itself is expertly illustrated. It is a series that certainly breaks the mould, avoiding the restrictions and cliches that run rampant through both the genre and animation in general. It is a story that’s message and characters are likely to resonate with the viewer, something only true art can accomplish. Ping Pong is Masaaki Yuasa at his best. Ping Pong is true art.<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read.<br />

    Oh yeah, Ping Pong: The Animation.<br />
I know I&#039;ll get reports and dislikes for this one,<br />
but please bear with me, since this is my oppinion.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
The story of Ping Pong is probably one of the poorest executed versions of &#039;Cliche-Sports-Story Mk I&#039;. There isn&#039;t even much I could spoil. What do you expect of the most cliched sportsstory?<br />
Take a while and imagine. I&#039;ll give you a hint its the same principle used in next to every shounen, as well as probably every sports anime.<br />
I don&#039;t have much of a problem with such a storyline in itself, but if the story is like that, you&#039;d need some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153365">
        other points to make up for it. And I simply couldn&#039;t find anything to make up for it. There is no comedy, no fanservice, no action scenes or anything else which made up for the classical storyline.<br />
<br />
Art: 1/10<br />
The original manga is actually from 1995 while the anime aired 2014. Still, at that time anime like Detective Conan or Dragonball also aired. Why would I be ever pleased with that art? In a way this style is really unique. Yes, I definitely haven&#039;t seen something like this before.<br />
<br />
The background arts -&gt; boring<br />
The character designs -&gt; ugly<br />
The animations -&gt; simply pathetic<br />
<br />
If you want an idea of what I mean by ugly character desings, just click one of the pictures above in the characters section. Most of the characters look like they didn&#039;t want to spend more time then necessary on the characters. The characters are merely some rough outlines, with some strokes as facial expressions. This can&#039;t obviously be enough.<br />
As for why the animation is simply pathetic: I noticed it rather early in one of the table tennis games. The ball nearly went to the ground, but they got it back on the table. In a straight line. From UNDER the table. One of the greatest physic fails of all time.<br />
Sure, this might be intentionally by the drawers. Or it might just as well be a crude mistake.<br />
I personally prefer realistic and fluent movements.<br />
For reference also a reason why the background arts are boring: In the first episodes, the main characters gym is presented. Fair enough. In the later episodes, the rivaling school has the exact same gym. Well with everything which was green in the main heroes gym being purple...<br />
Summed up, the rather low quality of the anime completely distracted me from everything else.<br />
It took several hours for me to get used to it, and by that time the anime was already half over.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
The voice acting was basically mediocre. The only voice I even remember is Wengs. I&#039;m personally a fan of using original languages with foreigner characters. And well, Weng, or his seiyu, pulled that one off pretty good. Next, the BGM: unmemorable.<br />
And I mean unmemorable. I watched one of the episodes again, just caring for BGM. And theres next to none to begin with. This one might be for style reasons, making the actually existing ones more important, but those that actually exist are just mediocre tracks sadly.<br />
As for how they are mediocre. They sound generic and could be used in every anime. They don&#039;t connect to what the anime wanted to present, or at least thats what it feels like for me.<br />
Last, we have the opening and ending, which both were, to be honest, absolute forgettable as well. Just as the BGM, if there wasn&#039;t the video, I would never even imagine that this would be Ping Pongs Opening/Ending, which is really sad.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
And once again Kong Weng is the guy who saves up some points.<br />
Both his background, as well as his character was well fleshed out and, to top it off, realistic.<br />
I really disliked both main characters, because both only have one or two memorable traits.<br />
Their backgrounds get described every once in a while in some talkes other characters have, and to be honest, those backgrounds are, just as the story, used a hundred times, again.<br />
This is one of the mainreasons I didn&#039;t enjoy Ping Pong at all. Everything seems just like we&#039;ve all seen it before, with nothing which elevates it out of the masses.<br />
The character development, especially Smiles, came off rather forced.<br />
Pecos on the other hand, was the classic shounen development. Its a reasonable one, but once again an abused one.<br />
At least the side characters are, compared to other anime, acceptable.<br />
They have some traits that make them enjoyable, backstories that might make them interesting or developments, which make them more vived. But, here as well, these are the classical ideas, used just another time.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
I only laughed once in the whole anime. And thats because of a scene where the arts nearly killed me. I personally hated this stuff, but since its a Top 100 I wanted to give it a shot and also have it completed.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
In my opinion one of the poorest anime I&#039;ve seen so far, and I&#039;m at 100 days of watching anime.<br />
Maybe you&#039;re better off trying it for yourself, because I absolutely disliked it and can&#039;t possibly recommend it. Maybe you&#039;ll come to like something, I absolutely didn&#039;t.<br />
If you&#039;re interested in sports anime however, just go with Kuroko no Basket. If you&#039;re interested in good character development, go with one of KEYs works, either Clannad, Little Busters!, or Angel Beats.

    Ping Pong The Animation is my one hundredth completed Anime up until this point in my Anime watching hobby/career, and I would feel bad about myself if I did not review this amazing Anime, and let this opportunity all go to waste. So why did I choose Ping Pong The Animation, in particular, to be my one hundredth Anime to be completed? Why not choose any other Anime out of the thousands of Anime on the site? Why Ping Pong in particular? Well, there are many good reasons for that. First of all, I wanted my one hundredth Anime to be something of great quality,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305441">
        and for it to be something that has a different, yet a great art style and animation to boot. I also wanted it to be something that has a compelling story to tell and amazing characters to introduce and develop all the way through up until it’s final episode. Lastly, I wanted a great story, but a story that is short and can wrap up everything it introduced nicely in just eleven episodes of nothing but pure, adrenaline pumping ping pong matches. Since I very much enjoyed Kaiba, which was made by the same director, Masaaki Yuasa, I thought that I might give this one Anime a try and have it take the honor to be my one hundredth completed Anime. I had already watched and enjoyed most of the short and eminent works in Anime before, and Ping Pong The Animation looked promising to be next in line. So, did Ping Pong The Animation fail in entertaining me? Absolutely not! Was it amazing all the way through? Definitely! A not so great concept, an average sports concept, and a lame sport, all of those things turned into one of the greatest sports Anime of all time. It achieved this by using brilliant execution and cinematography, introducing three dimensional characters, and spicing it all up with a great and memorable soundtrack. I would be lying to myself if I said that I wasn’t addicted to this Anime, glued to my screen while watching everything these amazing characters did. Kaiba may have been a good Anime by Masaki Yausa, but this was truly something else. <br />
<br />
The story of Ping Pong starts off with a very simple premise, some guys at an academy are competing to win the grand prize in a sport they are playing. The premise of Ping Pong is not so great to be honest. A lot of stories in Anime have way better premises to work with than what Ping Pong has here, but most of them fail when it comes to executing their basis and living up to their full potential. Ping Pong The Animation, in contrast, is a story about people who are working hard to be the very best at Ping Pong. It is not one of the best premises in Anime, it is not even good per say, it is just an average and routine premise. It has no fancy super powers, it has no mechas or magic, nor does it have any evil villains to work with. The premise is as average and realistic as a premise can get. What sets Ping Pong’s basic story apart from most other Anime titles, though, is the execution of it’s ideas and the subversion of the audience’s expectations. Ping Pong executes it’s ideas so well and amazes it’s audience by how good an average scene can turn out to be with just the right amount of angles and heart pumping music, and it is an Anime that lives up to it’s potential fully by doing so. I also mentioned that this Anime likes to subvert audience expectations and it is not as predictable as you might expect it to be. Really, I was blown away by how much my expectations were subverted during this Anime’s run. An example of a scene from Ping Pong, where expectations will be subverted, would be when two players are against playing each other and one of them has the upper hand during the match. Normally, you would think that the player with the upper hand has the victory secured in the bag, but you would be wrong to assume that. With one trump card from the loser, everything can be turned around and be reset again. This does not become cliché during Ping Pong’s run though, as Ping Pong does not depend on subverting audience expectations most of the time. Sometimes, if a match seems in favor of a player, then that match is guaranteed to be in their favor until the very end. With all of those things Ping Pong possesses, Ping Pong’s plot becomes realistic and surprising at the same time. It becomes surprising due to how unpredictable it can be, and it becomes realistic because it does not always lead to scenarios we want/we think it will go to. Ping Pong The Animation not only possesses those attributes in terms of storytelling, which make it a great Anime, but some more that make it stand out above most others. The three dimensional characters this Anime created, and their different motives and diverse disciplines, make this Anime a treat to watch all the way through. I was glued to my screen, wanting to know what character A will do next, or what character C will do when he faces off against character G. Speaking of the brilliant characters, all of them are developed and are given their own personality, not one is left out, which makes the story even more enthralling than it already is.<br />
<br />
I also like how the story does not shy away from asking the deep, philosophical questions most other stories do not want to address. I do not think any other sports Anime has looked into it’s characters the way Ping Pong The Animation has looked into it’s own. The Anime not only unfolds an incredible journey of well developed, determined characters in front of your eyes, but also explores them deeply while asking meaningful questions and covering mature topics. “Why do we play ping pong in the first place? Why do we play the sport? Is it to have fun? Is it to win? Is it to pass time until we become mere bones?” and that is what I like about Ping Pong, it is a sports Anime, but it is also a psychological Anime as well, not shying away from asking important questions within it’s narrative and challenging the viewer. It is a simple story executed to almost perfection, and it adds to it&#039;s great narrative by not being shy of reaching out to cover heavier topics. <br />
<br />
What turns an Anime from a good one to a great one? Three dimensional, interesting characters. I like it when the characters are so interesting and developed, to the point where a face-off between them actually makes me want to see it, and gets me pumped up for it in the process. Ping Pong does exactly that. The characters are so realistic and interesting, each one of them going through their own development and having their own motives, to the point where the Anime can pit anyone of them against each other and it would still be interesting to watch. The thing about this Anime is that all of it&#039;s characters are so well developed, to the point where I cannot choose which one of them is my favorite. Obviously China is the best according to my heart, but he has some fierce competition coming his way from both Peco and Smile, who are both as brilliant as China when it comes to their motives/characterization. Let us start off with China/Kong Wenge, the best character in the show in my honest opinion. This is the guy that oozes cool whenever he appears on the screen, and he is legitimately entertaining and exciting to watch. Whenever China appeared on the screen, I thought “This is definitely going to become entertaining now.” China is seriously so cool, to the point where he would smoke both Spike Spiegel and Yusuke Urameshi in a cool contest. The best thing about China though, and what separates him from the other characters in this Anime, is that he starts off as one dimensional at first, while the rest of the cast get development right from the spot. It isn’t until China loses his cool in a match that we finally get to see more layers to him. With that being said, China becomes perfect for this series because he subverts the audience’s expectations, where the audience thinks that he is the typical Anime bad-ass with no feelings or emotions, and then he turns out to be the most layered character in the whole series.  That is what I like about China, it is that he subverts viewer expectations into thinking that he is one dimensional at first, due to his egotistical attitude and calm demeanor, but you would be wrong to assume that. Yes, China is cool, calm and collected, and he does start off that way in the Anime, but he changes immensely once the plot kicks in. It is ironic how China is supposed to be portrayed as this bad-ass winner at first, but he becomes more human than the protagonist, Tsukimoto Smile. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Smile, his character development is very satisfying to watch and look at, why? Because Smile is the opposite of both Peco and China. While the other two start off as calm and collected, thinking that they are the best at what they do and that no one can even touch them, Smile starts off as the complete opposite. Smile starts off thinking that he is a pathetic loser, and unlike the other two, he only plays the game to “pass time until he is dead” and not to win. It isn’t until Smile is finally pushed beyond his breaking point that he actually starts to become like the other two. It isn’t until Smile is put in a stressful situation like that of China’s that he finally starts to reach into his ego and become more like China. And that is the beautiful thing about China and Smile, both of them begin to change when they start to lose or when they are put in a stressful situation, but one of them begins to become the bad-ass while the other starts to become more on the emotional side. They do change, but they change and are still two opposites of the same coin. The normal guy passing time becomes the bad-ass trying to win, while the bad-ass trying to win becomes the normal guy passing time. Did I mention earlier how an Anime confrontation can be exciting to watch when the characters are well developed and interesting on their own? Well, when China and Smile faced off against each other, I was thrilled because those two had such a great dynamic with each other, due to them being polar opposites, but also being one in the same. Smile is a great character on his own, and as I said earlier, his development is satisfying to watch and to look at. <br />
<br />
Other characters like Peco, who is supposed to be another main character, is also multilayered and three dimensional. He is the polar opposite of Tsukimoto, and his character arc is just as good as Tsukimoto’s. Peco starts off as your average born talent, born to win and conquer the ping pong industry. Peco, just like Wenge, also suits this Anime because of how unpredictable his character arc is. Peco starts off with a huge ego and an “I am holier than thou” attitude. We think that he is the main character of the Anime, but as it turns out, he really is not. After seeing Peco dominate the rookies, it isn’t until he is trashed and skunked by both China Wenge and his former teammate from Kaio academy, that his character arc takes a major turn. After his two big losses, he simply cannot believe the outcomes of the situations, and he finally starts to become less like China Wenge, and more like the old Tsukimoto, while Tsukimoto, due to his winning streaks and the stress he was placed under, starts to become more like China Wenge and less like the old Tsukimoto. We then get to see Peco go on his own journey until he can get back what he has lost, and it isn’t until reality crushes his hopes and dreams, and he is placed under the same situation Tsukimoto was placed in, that he actually starts to put in that hard work and sweat into his day to day life, instead of relying on his mere talents alone. <br />
<br />
With of all of that being said, this is the beautiful thing about these three main characters. Tsukimoto, Wenge and Peco are all one in the same, but they change and develop to the point where they never are a copy of one another. The three of them all have huge egos at one point in the Anime, but they experience it at different times. They also start off as cliché characters, but their interactions with one another help turn them into brilliant characters on their own. This is especially the case with Wenge, who starts off as one dimensional as they can get, but develops to be the best character in the series. <br />
<br />
Aside from the three main characters, I really liked Ryuuichi Kazama, the main member of the Kaio Academy table tennis club. He is highly respected by the other club members and is somewhat of a local hero. He represents the idea of the winner very well. You see all of these winners in life, all of these champions who have countless medals, but do you see what is underneath the act that they put on infront of the masses? Kazama is an amazing character because underneath the surface of being a hero and a champion, he is just a guy who feels pain like the rest of the cast, he has insecurities that he does not want to show, because he was placed in a situation in which he cannot escape from. He was born to train, the pressure was so great and overwhelming to the point where he can’t escape from it now, he has to do it because it has become a responsibility instead of a hobby. He is like an addict, no matter how hard he tried, and even if he wanted to, he just cannot escape the addictive nature of training and winning matches. There is a quote in the series which describes him perfectly, and that quote says “I am sure you will understand too, someday. The melancholy of winning. The pain of praise. The weight on your shoulders… the loneliness and agony. The time will come where your efforts will seem meaningless and your victories empty.”<br />
<br />
In the end, what is so good about the thousands of victories, the thousands of medals, the thousands of fans and all the praise, when one cannot love themselves? Of course, Kazama, just like the others, gets his development sooner or later, because every character in Ping Pong does. <br />
<br />
Moving on to the visuals, this part might seem a bit tricky. Ping Pong The Animation does not shy away from being something that is different. It does not care about the rest, it starts off not caring about the opinions of others and ends on the same exact note. It does not stick to the same old tropes that other Anime stick to and bore you with, it strays away from them. A lot of people mention that they are turned off by the art style for the show. I just have to say that I completely disagree with all of those people who are saying that. This is why this part of the technicalities is tricky, it is because people have contentions with the dirty looking, unorthodox art style. It might set some people off, but that just wasn&#039;t the case here with me.  <br />
<br />
The staff went for something different in this show. They did a lot of the animation in Flash, and it looks incredibly weird and awkward compared to most mainstream anime, but I think that lends a character to the show that a lot of Anime do not have. This type of visual and “dirty look” that the show has really distinguishes it from the rest, and makes it stand out as something that looks diverse. The visuals and character designs may not be the absolute best, but they are very memorable and recognizable. I like that it&#039;s not pristine, with sharp edges and smooth curves. The animation, especially later on in the series, feels wild and evokes emotion of it’s own. It feels like the animators are just letting loose and it gives so much weight to the actions of the characters. It makes Ping Pong The Animation seem more fluid when it comes to the movements of it’s characters, which is exactly what a sports Anime like this needs to be striving for. <br />
<br />
I like the camera angles displayed in this Anime, they do not look amateur or mediocre, but look pleasing to the eyes. Yausa was a master when it came to representing scenes with different angles in Kaiba, and he does it very well here. I also like how they represent the allegories and metaphors in this show. For example, Wenge/China in the first episode shoots up the ball to the roof when facing off against Peco, an airplane appears in place of the roof. I like that, it shows us more depth to Wenge, but without grabbing our hand and giving us all of the details about his backstory in one go. China is supposed to be a transfer who left his country, or was transferred because of failure, using imagery to convey his story was a brilliant idea. Other than that, I thought that the designs were all great. Each character felt distinguishable from one another, but they actually felt like they belonged in the same Anime, different enough to give each one a unique sense of style and personality, but not so different to the point where they feel like they belong in a different show. I also like how all of them look realistic, no orange haired kid, no red haired kid, no blue haired girl or any of that sort, just natural and realistic hair color. <br />
<br />
As for the soundtrack, it does more than it&#039;s job. It is striking and memorable, just like the art style. On another note, I liked “Initialize Me” and some other tracks while listening to the soundtrack of Kaiba, so I expected nothing less from the same director when it came to the soundtrack of this show. Really, what can I say? The coolest track in this Anime is “China”, and that is ironic because I also believe that China is the coolest character in this Anime as well. I also like the track that is called “Peco” because it perfectly describes Peco’s character (happy, go lucky, enthusiastic). All of these tracks are great tracks on their own to be honest, but the one that I was addicted to the most would have to be “Like A Dance”, which perfectly places the viewer in the mood to watch the adrenaline pumping ping pong matches this Anime displays in front of them. These are the types of tracks that you actually take time to download to your phone due to how amazing they are to listen to, especially the case with “Like a Dance”. The opening is great and the ending is great, nothing to complain about here, I was pumped with every “Oh Yeah” the opening slapped me with. I liked all of the voice actors, and the English dub is done by none other than Funimation, so it is guaranteed to be good. The one that stood out the most to me, though, was China as well. His Mandarin accent and voice acting were brilliant to listen to, and it added more character to him as a whole. China on his own is probably the best character in the series, but the mandarin accent was a very cool touch to a cool character like him. <br />
 <br />
Overall, Ping Pong The Animation is very close to being a masterpiece, and I am not just saying that because it is my one hundredth completed Anime. I do not like to give random nines or tens to any Anime that I watch, but this definitely deserves it. It is less of a sports Anime, and more of an amazing human psyche discovery. It asks thought provoking questions, it brilliantly presents amazing characters and develops them well, it pumps you up and keeps your blood boiling with some epic music and action packed, smooth animation to boot. Disregarding all of that, what Ping Pong The Animation does best, which most other Anime fail at doing, is that it also keeps the viewer glued to the screen. Once you start with Ping Pong The Animation, you will want to binge watch and finish it all in one go. Kaiba was good, but it was boring and discomforting during some parts. Ping Pong The Animation never felt boring at all, it keeps moving forward and entertaining the audience with something. I am glad that I watched and experienced Ping Pong The Animation, and I highly recommend anyone go check it out.

    THIS IS THE GREATEST...................................DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!<br />
<br />
This show is ass and not the good kind.<br />
<br />
I am going to compare it to Van Gogh&#039;s 1888 &quot;The Night Café&quot; throughout this review. When anyone looks at &quot;The Night Café&quot;, they see a subpar painting. They are standing there confused as to why everyone is proclaiming this to be a fine piece. You need to know that the light green bar is representative of the green fairy. You need to know that the clock is just past twelve so it isn&#039;t tactful to be drinking during either time. You have to know that the warm walls with the white tables will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211078">
        cause the tables to seemingly walk away from the walls if heavily intoxicated. Then you must be aware that the yellow room in the back is inviting and is everything that isn&#039;t the room you are currently in. I can go on about this piece for about ten minutes and I feel like I am pretending to be every zealot who loves &quot;Ping Pong The Animation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just like &quot;The Night Café&quot;, people go out of their way to polish a turd. People make it sound like it is the only &quot;coming of age tale&quot; when there are indeed tons of them. &quot;Coming of age&quot; may as well be it&#039;s own genre. They recycle the exact same scenes when showing character development. Let&#039;s watch Peco get slapped again. Let&#039;s see if Ping Pong Man becomes anything significant. I have played sports and I was good at some and not so good in others. Big deal! I personally lived the best part of this anime with little to no effort. I like abstract representational art. I appreciate the use of symbolism and scale to convey points. This show borderline took the piss with it&#039;s art. No one could have actually been touched by the guy on the beach. He was wandering around like an emo kid and it kept reoccurring without anyone caring about him. <br />
<br />
The art-style is awful. I understand wanting to stay true to the source material, but alterations would have been seriously advised. Let&#039;s take something everyone loves; Steins;Gate. The art in the anime was similar to the VN, but someone with common sense realized that it would be a feat to keep that style up for an entire anime. They took some polish off and kept the same feeling. This is an adaption done correctly. I have seen cars hit by trains that had smoother lines than what this animation has given us. People fail to realize failure when they love something and overlooking flaws is a virtue. The quality of an abstract non-representational piece of &quot;art&quot; done by a 5 year old that has been given three colors will be of the same caliber.<br />
<br />
I want to touch on the music quickly. There is one good song called &quot;Dragon&quot; and it goes &quot;Hoo-Ha PING PONG&quot; and then repeats. There is also one song that is so bad they didn&#039;t even put it on the OST. Listen for the humming song in the show if you want to go into an audio induced coma.<br />
<br />
The show was not enjoyable and I cannot believe that this is rated so highly. This show demonstrates how strong the troll community is by jokingly rating this show a 10. Most people that love this show have an average of less than 6 because they are the wannabe anime critics/hardasses and they all need a joke like &quot;Cory in the House&quot; to keep in their own circle.<br />
<br />
Avoid the show at all costs. Not worth your time.

    &quot;He&#039;s got to have a hole in his defense! He&#039;s reading me—he&#039;s predicting my moves. Show me your weak point! I just can&#039;t afford to end here!&quot; Think these lines are from the latest battle shounen? Wrong: they&#039;re from none other than Ping Pong: The Animation! If the theme of table tennis doesn&#039;t pique your interest, looking at the show&#039;s creators certainly should. Masaaki Yuasa, known for making great creative anime, teams up with Taiyou Matsumoto, a mangaka with similar experimental tendencies: the harmless fun-filled game of table tennis suddenly got a whole lot more interesting.<br />
<br />
The very first minutes of the show seek to impress:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151271">
        large shots of the protagonists&#039; table tennis hall, full of life and 2.7-gram balls hitting the table and players doing racket moves. Each chop, smash and drive is animated with shocking accuracy and from the best angles. All of this on watercolor backgrounds with resplendent palettes. Think the show&#039;s misshapen character designs do not fit the subject matter? Well, quite the opposite! The ill-proportioned art style not only allows characters to be easily animated from the tilted angles that make this series so full of life, they also explain why racket moves can be animated so accurately. With proportions and shadows being no object, Yuasa&#039;s hand moves the characters with real dynamism and diversity.<br />
<br />
The series progresses with various table tennis matches, art and animation carrying the visual impact while spot-on writing keeps each match and point varied and suspenseful. But not late in the series does it become clear that Ping Pong is not just about sports—it&#039;s also a powerful coming-of-age story with very engaging characters.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong opens with Smile, an apathetic player who sees table tennis as simply a way to pass time. His polar opposite, Peco, is an energetic, eccentric boy aiming to play in the Olympics and Smile&#039;s best friend since childhood. The anime spotlights a series of high school tournaments where Japan&#039;s best players gather. Kong, an accomplished player from China, has set to conquer Japan to make up for his rejection from his home country&#039;s team. Kazama, a member of the renowned Kaio Academy, is on an invincible streak. The stakes are high for those with a reputation, but both Smile and Peco are just starting to make a name for themselves.<br />
<br />
For an 11-episode run, the series juggles many characters effortlessly. While Smile and Peco are predominant, plenty of time is allowed to others like Kong, Kazama, even the coaches as we explore their desires, ambitions and conflicts related to table tennis. For example, with Kazuma we are faced with the monotony of being the best, the hard work it requires and its consequences on private life. Kong offers the heartwarming story of how an elite player from China gradually comes to respect little Japan. Peco, introduced with lines such as &quot;hard work is for chumps with no talent&quot;, learns to believe otherwise throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Smile, Peco, Kong, Sakuma, Kazuma... each of them come to rethink the way they  approach table tennis and their reason for playing. All in different ways, the characters find the approach to table tennis that brings them the most joy and peace. The spectrum of table tennis covered is huge—through older characters we even gain insight into the money-minded aspect of the sport. As an 11-episode coming-of-age story, Ping Pong is surprisingly complete and cathartic.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s even greater about Ping Pong is how expressive its screenplay and dialogue is. For example, in a setting where top performance is imperative, smoking is tacitly rejected: there&#039;s a scene where a character lights up a smoke, communicating his desire to stop playing competitively. Another character takes his cigarette off his mouth, and though they say nothing of it, it furthers that other character&#039;s will to make him play again. <br />
<br />
Consider the insert song segment in episode 6: this scene has no spoken line, yet it is one of the most meaningful. Kong opens the sequence singing the insert song at a karaoke with his team—showing us his development from spiting Japan to opening up to Japanese players and learning their language—and the scene continues with various shots of the other characters&#039; occupation on Christmas Eve. Smile&#039;s part is poignant: unsurprising for a character shown to enjoy solitude, he is all alone at home, contemplating the Christmas cake his coach gifted him. But from Smile&#039;s lonely gaze and the candles he paid the effort to light we can tell that the boy does cherish what little warmth others give him. We begin to empathize with the character. Not present in the source material, this karaoke insert demonstrates Yuasa&#039;s amazing directing skills in combining spot-on soundtrack, perfect pacing and compelling shots.<br />
<br />
Helping Ping Pong transition between matches and character introspection is a diverse and excellent soundtrack. Pounding drums set the tone in pre-game sequences to stir up anticipation, and the next moment whimsical keyboard keys accompany Smile&#039;s scattered thoughts and memories. The show has a song for every moment and emotion, each used exceptionally and making for a complete audiovisual experience.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s amazing what Ping Pong accomplishes in its short 11-episode run. It chronicles the heartfelt physical and emotional journeys of multiple characters and delivers a conclusion brimming with heart yet grounded in reality. All of it conducted in an exciting, creative fashion in the perfect marriage of both Taiyou Matsumoto and Masaaki Yuasa&#039;s talent. The harmless, fun-filled game of table tennis did get a whole lot more interesting.<br />

    Ping Pong won the all exciting adventure this spring season of anime was and became anime of the season. Spring 2014 winner, woohoo. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong is an anime about life which centers around Ping Pong. The first challenge we viewers face is ironically the faces itself. Everyone looks the same, it is a pain to remember all the characters when they don&#039;t have different colored hairs nor any bishonen tropes on their character design. Our main characters are pretty easy. The other one is called smile, he never smiles, but he has glasses (not to be confused with megane). He is the most troubled character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147609">
        since he doesn&#039;t give a shit about anything or anyone. Especially not about Ping Pong, baaka. The other main character is the opposite of this guy, but isn&#039;t as recognizable since he doesn&#039;t have glasses or other visible.. details. The opposite of smile who never smiles but he (not smile) actually smiles. Simple. <br />
<br />
There are bunch of other characters too. Some of them are bald, some bold. Some have different colored skin and some speak chinese for life, so it is not impossible challenge to tell them apart. These guys ofc love Ping Pong and want to play that shit till the end of the world and whatnot. Except smile because he just isn&#039;t like all the other fucks, okay. The side characters go through the melancholy of being a ping pong player and a teenager by having worries about love and ping pong. Definitely a quality series with many realistic characters who all have much more in them than your typical... anime side character. Definitely a quality series with many interesting people who love ping pong. And smile who just doesn&#039;t give a fuck. <br />
<br />
The art of this series follows the art of the manga. The original artist didn&#039;t have the most stable hand in the seven kingdoms, but he managed to get the ink on the paper. The art is terribad and awful, but I like it. For once it is not the rest of the series that can be described with those words. The director is not the same sexy guy who directed Death Note, but almost equally sexy guy, the guy who directed Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, I mean. He is doing pretty good job on splitting the image in 3 during every single fucking Ping Pong scene/any other scene. Some say he likes his anime in 3, some say he has 3 eyes. One is sure, this man is a legend, did he try too much or not with Ping Pong. Although he did.<br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment, I don&#039;t usually enjoy anime because it sucks. But this one was pretty okay. I could even recommend it to adults who have it working, or maybe even youngsters too if they have it working.

    Ping Pong the Animation.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s one of those series that is either going to get over-the-top praise or disdain from it&#039;s watchers, for me it was simple disappointment.<br />

-Well like most sports anime the story is not too heavy. However Ping Pong&#039;s biggest problem is that the story and how it plays out has been done before, several times in fact. You can see the ending from the start and every &quot;twist&quot; isn&#039;t all that surprising once you get to the end. I was not entertained when it came to the story and it&#039;s presentation. <br />
NOTE: I do not take away points for it being a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149157">
        sports anime and having a sports-themed story. I take away points for unoriginal and poor presentation.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
-I&#039;d say the art is mediocre. Not because &quot;it&#039;s not HD so it sucks&quot; but because funimation purposefully made the anime this way, but still re-used animation within the first few episodes. I actually like this type of animation if it&#039;s done right, but way too many times in this series is it not. Funimation clearly had the budget for this anime, but chose to make several scenes look out of place and terrible because they didn&#039;t know what they were doing or didn&#039;t care.<br />
NOTE: The art style fits well with the theme.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
-It&#039;s there and not much else. Nothing outside of your generic background music and nothing you&#039;ll even remember in T-minus 5 minutes.(already forgot).<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
-Now the characters in this show are pretty well done. I&#039;d like to say they are &quot;deep&quot; but they really weren&#039;t. Only Hoshino and Tsukimoto really stood out, as everyone else became X, Y, or Z stereotype. That being said, Hoshino and Tsukimoto were deep in accordance to the story but not as characters themselves. &quot;One track mind&quot; would describe the entire youth of this cast. However there interactions are at least midly entertaining.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
I can&#039;t say I enjoyed my time watching this series more than the general mediocre anime. It&#039;s not exactly entertaining per episode, I&#039;ve seen the entire story/characters done before in other series(ala prince of tennis), and to be honest the ending/starting episodes were the only parts I think were worth the watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
<br />
Ping Pong the Animation is a series that presents a rather mediocre product to an already saturated genre. The art style differentiates it, but does not make it shine.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend it to people who have not watched other sports series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: this is all my opinion, but I stand by that opinion 100%.

    An anime about sports? An anime about ping pong? I would have never thought to ever give a show like this a try, while I do like the occasional play of table tennis in my freetime and during sports at school the idea of watching others playing it in the animated form was somewhat dull but interesting. Having heard from other sources that it is actually quite good and among the best series of this season I decided to check Ping Pong: The Animation out.<br />
<br />
Today it has ended and now I&#039;m sitting here at midnight writing this review because continuing Ping Pong after a long

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147585">
        break I took from it after episode 2 might have been the best decision I made regarding anime in a long time.<br />
<br />
Storywise Ping Pong: The Animation centers around the teenager nicknamed &quot;Smile&quot; and others at the Tamura Table Tennis club. It is a sports anime after all and there is -quite fortunately though - nothing happening which could be considered that much out of the ordinary with like super powers you have seen in other sports series. <br />
The series could be called a Coming-of-Age story. It focuses a lot on the relationships between the players, trainers and others and how their passion of table tennis affects them and others around them. And important part to make this work and catch the audiences sympathy are well done characters. And well done characters is something Ping Pong certainly has. The cast ranges from your more introverted main character to his chaotic childhood friend, to the arrogant yet talented but not flawless foreign antagonist, to the caring coach with a moving backstory and lots of other side characters from different schools, teams and nations wanting to make big. <br />
But this cannot happen without sacrificies and this is also something this show does well. Table tennis is serious business over there and it portrays it very well. I am not an expert when it comes to foreign tablet tennis but from what I have seen in Ping Pong: The Animation they catched the mood quite well and every anticipated battle felt as exciting and tense as an upcoming showdown in an action series. The atmosphere is really intense and puts shows like Sword Art Online to shame, but not only when it comes to the action. <br />
<br />
Most of this is achieved by the brilliant cinematography which uses an unique and definetly different art style than other shows ever did before. It is kind of hard to get into at first but the drawing style really grows onto you and actually fits the shows theme of being about a rather unusual sport, very well. <br />
<br />
In terms of accoustic accompaniment Ping Pong: The Animation offers everything from chilly background tunes to incentive electronic beats to make the rhythm chime and get you into the right mood. Also the voice actors did an immensily great job on expressing how the characters are feeling. Nothing really to complain about in terms of audiovisual arrangement either.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless one of the best parts are the characters. They are portrayed quite life-like as you could expect people to be participating in competitive sports. Every character feels real as you cheer and root for them to achieve their goal they have set in their lives and struggle with the possibility of defeat and others being better than them. They really undergo a well described development which seems believable and makes you care about them. The interactions between each other comes of as genuine and really natural. As their different personalities and egos clash you can really feel the tenseness. The creators did a fantastic job there.<br />
<br />
Overall Ping Pong: The Animation is a great show. While it may not be appealing to anyone I can highly recommend it to anyone having the slightest affiliation with table tennis. If you have not this show might not be for you but also if you are just in for something different than you may be welcome here as well since this is a story which can be enjoyed regardless whether you like ping pong or not. It&#039;s more about the characters than the actual sport.<br />
<br />
It is a sweet Coming-of-Age story about young people trying to find their meaning in life and after this a sports anime. Whether it will be the first place at the championships, social interaction or just to take part to find out in the end they aren&#039;t even made for table tennis. It&#039;s an emotional and unconventional ride and for me personally the best anime of this season.

    Ping Pong The Animation, originally created by Matsumoto Taiyou, is more than what one would call unique, even more so if you just look at sports Anime.<br />
<br />
The story of Ping Pong The Animation is unexpectedly complex while simple at the same time. It&#039;s not a light-hearted watch but nor is it deep enough to drown. The story follows multiple characters, highlighting Peco and Smile, while developing them all in amazing ways. There is always something to look forward to, whether there&#039;s a cliffhanger or not. Ping Pong The Animation feels like such a smooth watch; there are no bumps along the way. Doubts were had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147565">
        by many people before it started airing, but those were all cleared in the first episode. Not once did the story break down. It was solid throughout it&#039;s duration and left us on an incredibly strong ending. Unfortunately, it&#039;s an ending that leaves you begging for more even though there is no more that can be done. It leaves a somewhat small void.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is the highlight of this Anime for me. If I had to point at one show with the nicest look, it would be this. No less would be expected Masaaki Yuasa. The Anime strives and succeeds in looking like its source material, and does a grand job in doing so. Ping Pong wouldn&#039;t be the same without the unique style it has. This style I mention isn&#039;t restricted just to art, but to every single part of the Anime. Some parts look absolutely outstanding, especially in flashbacks or when the Anime is tackling the psychology of a character. The opening and ending look magnificent and really do capture the essence of what is Ping Pong.<br />
<br />
The sound in Ping Pong doesn&#039;t fall short compared to its other strong points. The sound a ball being hit, the sound of movement on mats, the music featured; it&#039;s all amazingly well done. The OST is one of the most surprising things in this Anime. It manages to strengthen every scene. A good OST for a sports Anime is one that gets your blood pumping, one that allows to you to follow what&#039;s happening even more closely with ease; that&#039;s what Ping Pong&#039;s OST does. The seiyuus do an amazing job as well, and the it&#039;s no surprise with the seiyuu being who they are. Smile&#039;s voice captures that of an emotionless robot which enhances the metaphor constantly used throughout the Anime. Peco is the opposite. He&#039;s a quirky, spirited character who&#039;s voice is also captured perfectly.<br />
<br />
The characters in Ping Pong are phenomenal. No one is just there for the sake of being there. Most characters have their mentality explored in some way even if they only explore once. This is one of my most favourite things about Ping Pong. No one is left out in the dark. Ping Pong fleshes out the characters perfectly with flashbacks and a inner monologue here and there. It sounds like a simple thing to do, but not many series do it well. In addition, the characters feel like magnets; I&#039;m attached to all of them. There&#039;s always one character that you&#039;re rooting for. There&#039;s always one you&#039;ll want to see more of. Each character is done justice by the time the series end.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this a whole lot, which is already obvious. Overall, this is an incredibly strong dent built in to the sports genre.  Every single element in this Anime helps another to be something amazing. Each element is nothing without the others. The characters are accompanied greatly by the art, which is boosted up by the music, which is held up by the atmosphere. Everything comes together to create something that is a must watch for a unique, but great experience in the world of Anime.<br />
<br />
Recommendation: If you haven&#039;t already, and you want more Anime of this level, I suggest you go and check out Tatami Galaxy, which is directed by Masaaki Yuasa.

    To dismiss, or to even think of Ping Pong: The Animation as another sports anime would be a gross error of judgement. Ping Pong: The Animation is not about sports. It is not about Ping Pong. Not really. It is a profoundly human story; a look at the lives, passions, and motivations of characters that sound and act so real that you can’t help think of them as real flesh and blood, people with feelings, emotions and souls of their own.<br />
<br />
No. Ping Pong is not about sports, or THE sport, or the ‘athletes’. It is not about winning or losing. It is against the very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166975">
        concept of competition, the ruthless system that creates winners at the cost of losers. It is a critique of the mindset that glorifies success and distorts life, and things as pure as, say, art, music, and sports (such as Ping Pong), turning these things into a means to achieving selfish desires such as money, power, glory, and honor. When a thing such as ping pong which is meant to direct human passion and creative impulses of man and to allow him to enjoy life by doing things for the sake of the thing itself is distorted or perverted to cater to more selfish desires there arises a need for a savior, a hero, someone to save not just Ping Pong but the true meaning of being alive, of indulging in the pure innocent joy of living, enjoying life and just having fun.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong: The Animation is about its characters; it is a coming of age story that explores, among other things, the theme of friendship, and the influence of the past on the present, how our decisions and efforts in the present affect the future and the natural process of constant growth and experience that every single person goes through.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY (9/10)<br />
<br />
Ping Pong does not has a story or plot in the sense that you can just lay down or explain to someone. It is all about the characters, what they go through, and what they become as a result of their experiences.<br />
<br />
It explores its complex of themes through brilliant character sketches, an empathetic narrative, an emotionally profound characterization, a stylish, somewhat surreal art style, and a brilliant direction style that employs a split screen technique to mimic the panels of a manga with occasional bursts of an audio-visual style dubbed as ‘magical realism’. <br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (10/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ping Pong’s main protagonists, if such a thematically nuanced story can have protagonists, are two high-school students and childhood friends,Tsukimoto ‘smile’ and Hoshino ‘Peco’. Smile is a reserved no-nonsense stoic, and ‘peco’ is his complete opposite, a non-serious, sprightly loud -mouth. They both possess a natural talent for Table Tennis (or Ping Pong), go to the same table tennis club, and are the best players of their High School Table Tennis team. <br />
<br />
But their untapped talent is not without strings attached; ‘Smiles’ lack of ambition and lack of will to win coupled with his gentle personality prevents him from ‘winning’ against most opponents. ‘Peco’, on the other hand, feels that winning is everything and thinks himself indestructible until he meets a Chinese Student, Weng Kong, who utterly defeats him, prompting him to stop practicing. Another defeat during a tournament leaves him devastated and he abandons the game altogether. <br />
<br />
The anime’s many characters include Coach Koizumi, who recognizes smile’s talent and vows to train him and make him better, and Wenge Kong, a Chinese student who, after being kicked from his Home team in China, travels to Japan to prove himself against the best that Nippon has to offer and redeem his place back home. The anime as an interesting motley of main, side, and minor characters; a whole list of intriguing characters with their own stories, and even the minor ones have been well fleshed out, including a character who after his defeat by Smile early on leaves on a journey to discover himself, only to find that table tennis has always been the passion of his life. <br />
<br />
Going into a detail of all the characters and their roles would be a waste. All I can say is that each character feels painfully and veritably human, is very well developed, and the process of growth that each of them goes through in the story is fascinating to say the least. The painstaking detail with which their characters are crafted, their body language, mannerisms, dialogues, and brilliant voice-acting, makes them feel alive like in a way fictional characters rarely feel so. <br />
<br />
This anime is about the journey all these characters go through, a process that cannot be easily described and has to be experienced by the viewers themselves to be understood and appreciated.<br />
<br />
ART/ANIMATION (10/10)<br />
<br />
Ping Pong’s art comprises of breathtaking, detailed backgrounds, and minimalist character designs; a combination that allows for great flexibility of expression and creative freedom. Think of Kaiba, Tatami Galaxy, and Tekkon Kinkreet blended together; a combination of the talented Yuasa Masaaki and the unsung auteur of manga Taiyou Matsumoto. The animation is very fluid, stylish, and surreal at times. The jaw-dropping details of the environment, and the complexity of character expression is quite impressive. The art/animation is very different, but not (in my opinion) an acquired taste. <br />
<br />
A notable aspect of the show relating to animation, sound and overall direction is the frequent bursts of ‘magical realism’ expressed through images which bring out the emotions and motivations of the characters during action sequences in a comic and fantastical way. For example, Kong Wenge’s desire to return to China is symbolized by a commercial plane in various sequences, Tsukimoto ‘smile’ desire to be saved by a hero manifesting during his early childhood experience of being bullied in school is personified by a hero figure, and so on.These sequences perfectly blend with the overall style of the anime and enhance the experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND (9/10)<br />
<br />
PP:TA showcases a near flawless VA performance, and the right kind of music used (sparingly) at the right time. Background tracks vary from soothing and laid back piano, use of synths and psychedelic tunes, to upbeat and energetic themes, perfectly timed and fitting, setting up the mood appropriate for the scenes. In short, the anime does everything ‘just right’ in this department. <br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL/ENJOYMENT (9/10)<br />
<br />
Directed and spearheaded by Yuasa Masaaki (Cat Soup, Tatami Galaxy, Kaiba, Mind Games), and adapted from a manga by Taiyou Matsumoto (Tekkon Kinkreet), Ping Pong: The Animation contains elements reminiscent of previous works by the two makers, such as the theme of friendship, adolescence, empathetic characterization and art of Tekkon Kinkreet, and the wacky, energetic, visceral oddness of Yuasa Masaaki’s previous works. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong has an extremely well written and intelligent script, with some of the best dialogue writing I&#039;ve come across yet. Yuasa Masaaki’s effortless direction with its ‘panel animation’ approach brings alive the pages of the manga in a way no other director could have accomplished. Each episode flows naturally into the next, and the quality almost never falters.<br />
 <br />
Ping Pong: The Animation is truly a gem, a near-flawless masterpiece that is destined to become a cult classic one day. Or maybe it already is.

    The anime industry is plagued with generic harems and bad writing. But occasionally a series will appear that stands out. A diamond in the rough. Ping Pong is one of these series. <br />
<br />
The story of Ping Pong is, on the surface, about ping pong. However, dig a little deeper and you will find a fantastic series about growing up. The series focuses on themes such as insecurity, anxiety and most notably, courage. These themes are explored to the fullest with seemingly insignificant scenes such as those featuring The Hero becoming increasingly relevant as the series progresses. This is not to say ping pong isn&#039;t relevant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147591">
        to the story, the competitiveness of the sport plays a large part throughout the series and is sure to appeal to any spots fan. It&#039;s the kind of show that requires your full attention. Seemingly minuscule and irrelevant events are important to the overall delivery of the series. These can include the speech of background characters or even the backgrounds. The story is paced exceptionally well with the exception of the last episode which as a manga reader I felt was dragged out and features too many flashbacks. Overall, the story is solid. There are lots of interesting themes that are handled very well throughout the series and the pacing is very good.<br />
<br />
The art of Ping Pong can be a bit off-putting, but after just one episode it will begin to grow on you. It&#039;s unique, and that&#039;s a good thing. It makes the series feel very mature (not to say the series isn&#039;t) as the art is more realistic than most modern anime. The animation is incredibly fluid. There are some shots of Ping Pong bats that look absolutely fantastic . There are a few scenes with noticeable budget drops, however, and these become increasingly common as the series progresses. Overall, very good animation and art.<br />
<br />
The OST of Ping Pong is excellent. Every track fits its purpose well. The OST makes the matches feel very tense and overall very interesting. The OP is very fitting with the lyrics reflecting some of the major themes of the series and the genre fitting the tone of the series as a whole. My personal favourite is the ED, which I feel is excellent. It suits the atmosphere of the series and leaves you wanting more. The voice actors are fitting, particularly Katayama Fukujurou (Peco) and Uchiyama Kouki (Smile). I felt their performances were very good. My praise also goes to Yousei Bun (Wenge Kong) for his performance in Chinese, it&#039;s rare not to see anime butcher foreign languages and it was nice of the studio to hire an actual Chinese voice actor for the role. <br />
<br />
The characters in Ping Pong are the best part, in my opinion. They are developed extremely well. I feel Peco&#039;s development was handled brilliantly and gives the viewer and in-depth look into his mind and ideologies alongside his emotions. This is not to say other characters are done badly,  Smile, Sakuma, Kong and Kazama all receive incredible growth throughout the series and are for the most part likeable. The transition between Kong&#039;s initial arrogance and later his kindness was done beautifully. There is not a single pointless character, they all exist for a reason. Even the seemingly insignificant speech of the background characters is important. There&#039;s not a single undeveloped character and for this reason, I believe the characters are the best part of Ping Pong. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong is a very enjoyable series. Every episode leaves you wanting more. The series makes you feel a range of emotions from pity to happiness. It was a very fun series to watch.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong is an excellent series, a must-see for all anime fans. The themes, the characters, the music; everything is brilliant. I believe the anime to be better than the manga, and by choosing the manga you would be missing out. The series does require the full attention of the viewer however, and for this reason it&#039;s not the easiest to marathon because there&#039;s a lot to take in. Otherwise though, it&#039;s one of the best series of 2014 at the time of writing.

    - NOT A SPOILER FREE REVIEW -<br />
<br />
This review was made to make people fully understand this show, which often makes people confused, not because it is hard to understand, but because the show tries to push in 11 episodes as much motives as it takes and the full meaning is not as visible as it is needed to understand it while watching it for the first time.<br />
If you didn&#039;t like Ping Pong the Animation or didn&#039;t really understand what was going on in there i encourage you to read this review.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ping Pong the Animation is an exceptional show, unorthodox in every aspect, at first glance

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208939">
        a normal sport show, but turns out to be something more, a strong emotions feel trip about different people struggling with life and finding their definition of happiness. The Ping Pong as a game itself is not really important for the plot, you can swap it with anything you want, even life itself, the game is only an excuse to portray characters motives, represent their state of mind, because Ping Pong the Animation isn’t really much of a sports show, there are no cool techniques, the matches are excitatory and artistic, which is job of an eccentric art and unparalelled animation made by Yuasa Masaaki, who is often praised for his work and the soundtrack which perfectly fits the atmosphere and propel the more tense scenes and make some of them truly epic. The stars of this show are: Tsukimoto, Peco, Kong Wenge, Kazama and Sakuma. What makes this show stand out is the fact, that every character starts with a big lack, something that either limits them or makes them unhappy. In the middle of the show something happens to them that turns their point of view upside down and and eventually every one of them positively changes. Everyone wins in this <br />
<br />
<br />
Kong Wenge is a Chinese player who got kicked out of the national China team and decides to transfer to Japan to make himself a name there which might allow him to go back to his team. He was cocksure and full of himself, disgusted by the way everyone plays and ensured that no one is on his level and no one even deserves to stand on the same table with him. He wanted to return to his homeland so badly, but he knew he&#039;s stuck in here. The theme with a plane flying away symbolises moving back to China, every time when he looked up at a flying plane he yearned for homeland and playing for his old team, but he knew he&#039;s not able to do so. In the first tournament he barely lost to Tsukimoto, he won only because of Tsukimoto&#039;s mercy for him, but eventually got skunked by Kazama later on. That was his biggest lesson of humility in his life. He lost twice to people whom he didn&#039;t respect. Now he is forced to reckon with the fact that Japan may now be his home. After the tournament his trainer tolds him that honestly his life only starts and he just have gotten on start line, it doesn&#039;t matter if he fails at Table Tennis. He gets offered a job of training a team. Kong turns to be a wonderful trainer, he&#039;s sharing useful advices with his students and is encouraging them to train. Even after defeat he&#039;s not giving up on playing Ping Pong and still trains to get better. In the second tournament when he played Peco and still lost, the &quot;plane&quot; flied away, but he doesn&#039;t care anymore. He&#039;s not willing to go back to China, because Japan is now his home, he found something that holds him here and it was his team for which he was a Leader and inspiration. If you cannot reach something you want, then look up to the things you have already got and seek for good things in them. At the end of the show we see that his will to continue training even after constant defeats paid out - he moved out to Europe and started playing on Olympic level. <br />

Hoshino Yutaka, alias Peco is a truly gifted player, he even could outplay older players as a child, he was always in the spotlight, but his constants victories and his natural capabilities made him really full of himself and eventually got slothful and lazy. Instead of training and developing his skills he was eating candies and snacks. When he played Kong Wenge in the first episode he got totally skunked, he haven&#039;t even scored one point. He never experienced that big defeat before. He celebrated his defeat with tears and despair and eventually he got even more lazy, which made him completely unprepared for the competition ahead of him. In the first tournament he noticed that Smile had almost won with Kong Wenge - the player that he lost to without scoring any point. It was a great shock, because he was always thinking that he is better than Smile. In the same tournament he played Sakuma, who was always worse than him up to this moment, but over time he overcame the difference in skill between them with hard work and dedication to sport and it ended up in lose for Peco. Sakuma laughed down at him telling that he should give up on the sport, because he is no longer good. Constant defeats and his descention in skill made him lost his confidence and eventually ended up on decision to give up on Table Tennis. Peco started eating even more snacks, got fat, adust and started smoking. He got into a relationship that didn&#039;t really work out, the girl broke up with him just because he didn&#039;t bring up her Christmas Gift. Later on when Peco visits his old Ping Pong club where he mets Sakuma. He tells Peco that he need to go back to Ping Pong, because he loves that sport more than anyone else. Peco after seeing photo featuring him and Tsukimoto holding a trophy, gets reminded of his love for the sport and goals of becoming the greatest and ultimately decides to go back to Table Tennis. He determines to start from the very beginning, trains very hard and develops his skills even further which results in winning the second tournament. Peco is the hero of Ping Pong, and he represents all that the show values and believes in. He does not fear defeat - because he plays for his earnest love of the game, and his earnest love of those he plays with. While playing Kazama and Smile whom are content to remain safe in their own cages, Peco lifts them up with his belief, and they lift him higher in turn. I know and im sure you know too some people who got that kind of passion for their lifes. <br />
<br />
Sakuma, alias &quot;Devil&quot; is a childhood friend of Peco and Smile. He&#039;s got no talent for Table Tennis, because of an eye astigmatism that doesn&#039;t allow him to achieve the same response time as other players, which is essential in Table Tennis. Always envious to Peco for his great Ping Pong capabilities, for that he was always in the center of attention unlike him and got so many trophies for winning. He decided to work hard to overcome the obstacle that he met while playng on a higher level and eventually found a place in prestigious Kaio sport club which resulted in winning with Peco. After the first tournament he challenged Smile for a game. It was shocking experience for him since he didn&#039;t know that Tsukimoto might become that good. He totally lost, defeat at Smile’s hands forces him to realize that sometimes you just don’t have the aptitude to achieve your dreams, even thought he was a little relieved with that fact. That was the turning point for his life, because he no longer was limited by desire to win. In the second tournament he seems to be happy and in the end of the show it is said that he started a family. If you have no talent in something you shouldn&#039;t cry about that, just find something else that you are good in and move on, or focus on something else, life doesn&#039;t end on Ping Pong.<br />
<br />
Then there is this dude, who played Tsukimoto in the first tournament. After he lost, he decided that Table Tennis is not for him and he decided to travel around the world and find his place on Earth. He tried on the beach, on the mountains, on the desert, but every time he felt that this is not what he was looking for. After a year he ended up on the second tournament in Japan. Tears filled his eyes when he realized that it was Ping Pong all along that he loved, but he have given up too easily on it, just because of one defeat. Witnessing the match between Peco and Smile, he rejuvenated his love for Ping Pong and eventually found his way to the Olympic stage (at the end of the show he is sitting on the stands with Japan national team shirt on).<br />
<br />
&quot;Defeat is death&quot;, &quot;The truth lies in victory&quot; - those are the slogans of Kaio, sport club obviously aiming to be the greatest that is never fully pleased with their athletes performance. Sport hall opened 24/7 available for training, trainers from around the world, in-depth analyses of training, highest quality sports equipment available to players for free, the usage of modern medicine to keep athletes bodies in perfect condition. Those are only the few of opportunities that Kaio is providing for their players. The only condition is - if you&#039;re not playing well enough, you&#039;re getting kicked out. They are even getting cut bald to not let hair distract players while playing. Kaio is a factory of robots playing Table Tennis for the victory. Kazama Ryuuichi is magnificently talented player which is the best player of Kaio sport club and their biggest trump card. He has been taught that the only route to success is victory, believes that the failings of others are definable and surpassable as lack of effort. Not only does he not rely on the strength of others, but he also doesn’t lend others his strength. The amount of stress he used to experience, because of his responsibility everyone are trying to bestow overwhelms him. Ping Pong has become a cage for Kazama - he used to close in the toilet and stand alone in his stall, staring silently down at his purple ping pong shoes before any bigger competitive, because of the fear. While he was playing with Peco in the second tournament he could see him &quot;flying&quot;. Though walls of his bathroom are closed, the ceiling is open. Kazama can still look, can still reach, can still dream. The match between Peco and Kazama ends not in dour dramatics, but in laughter, in a shared love of the sport. Kazama&#039;s play defined fear, but Peco manages to break through to him and show him through competition and love that there is joy in these exchanges. At the end of the show he&#039;s telling that he got kicked out of the professional team, but as the time passed he learned to overcome failures gracefully. He&#039;s not afraid anymore, either victory or defeat, he will be able to face it boldly.<br />
<br />
Makoto Tsukimoto, a friend of Peco that was introduced to Table Tennis by him, called &quot;Smile&quot;, because of his lack in expressing any emotions often insulted by his classmated. When he started playing Ping Pong - he was smiling like a madman. Peco gave a lesson to everyone that tried to insult him and pulled him out of a &quot;cage&quot; he was sitting in, because of that Peco has become his role model and &quot;hero&quot;, he wanted to be just like him. At the start of the show Tsukimoto wasn&#039;t smiling at all. It was because he didn&#039;t feel any motivation for playing Table Tennis. It was because Peco was playing bad and behaved pathetic. Smile after years proved to be horribly good player, his overwhelming power becomes evident. He was subconsciously letting Peco him win to not hurt feelings of his &quot;hero&quot;, which later on trainer Koizumi noticed. He even gets scouted by Kazama from Kaio, but it was Koizumi who awakened his potential. He starts training under his wings, not because he wanted to, but because he just wanted to win, he truly started behaving like a robot. Even though he got the power to crush every player he faced he couldn&#039;t help with loneliness he constantly felt, he spent Christmas Eve alone, even training Table Tennis with Koizumi would be better. Tsukimoto was told since he was very young that he&#039;s a &quot;robot&quot;, that he is emotionless and incapable of feeling. However, Peco still remembers why Smile is called by that nickname, smiling is an emotion too, Tsukimoto have to feel that human emotion - Smile - again and remind to himself why he started playing. After Peco won with Kazama, he knew that his &quot;hero&quot; is back and he don&#039;t need to hold back anymore - it was always Peco’s joyfulness that made Table Tennis so wonderful for him. While playing with Peco he slowly came to realize why he is playing the game. It is because &quot;Blood tastes like Iron&quot;, it is the taste of blood in your mouth after a big effort that make it truly worth experiencing (We are alive song). At the end Smile throwns the racket in the air and shows that it no longer have any hold on him, he have to find happiness by his own way now. He can toss the racket free without regrets, because he now knows who he wants to be - a teacher.<br />
<br />
The scene on the train when Smile says “the one after next” is relevant to just about everything the show discusses. Smile waits for his hero to make it to him at the finals - the match after Peco’s “awakening” vs Kazama. Kong fights to make it to his next match - to find a home for him and his mother. The whole show is really about what comes after what you are doing now. Ping Pong the Animation doesn&#039;t show it&#039;s characters falling, because of their patheticism, but because they need to fail. Every one of their defeats made them stronger. Failure in Table Tennis is not the end of the world. Making it to the next match is much less difficult when you are passionate about what you are doing. Peco’s love for ping pong is exactly what allows him to get to his next match, because there is always something else waiting for you. The whole point of the show is to not seek for victory. Victory will not give you timeless satisfaction, only seeking seek true passion and joy from what you&#039;re doing just like Peco will provide it to you.<br />

    Note: This is my first really serious review, so any feedback is appreciated!<br />
<br />
Where do I even begin. I&#039;ve asked myself that question about that show time and time again. I guess the best place to start, as always, is the beginning. Be warned, there are slight spoilers although I try not to. It&#039;s hard gushing about a show I love so much now without talking about ALL of it.<br />
<br />
I saw this show on the Spring anime list. I thought, &quot;I like ping pong, that&#039;s pretty funny, I wonder what the show will be about.&quot; I had not read the manga, I did not know any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147583">
        of the backstory. Looking back at it now, I much preferred it that way. <br />
<br />
The first episode was good. Not incredible, but good enough for me to say &quot;Hey, maybe this can go somewhere.&quot; As I continued to watch, every week, I thought, &quot;No way, this just can&#039;t get any better. There&#039;s absolutely no way this show could be any more awesome.&quot; And then, just like that, it was over. It was 11 weeks but it felt like a flash.<br />
<br />
What caught me initially, what really hooked me and continued to play a strong role throughout the whole show (and what I&#039;ll be focusing on in the review, for good reason), were the characters. Oh man, the characters. Smile, Peco, Kazama, Butterfly Jo, the mountains guy, Akuma, Wenge... all of them were amazing in their own way. This wasn&#039;t a show about ping pong so much as it was a show about who they were. <br />
<br />
Seeing all these characters grow and learn was a wonderful experience. First, there was Wenge who lost and got knocked off his high horse. That was something, but even more so was when he got back up and set his mind to bettering himself with the support of his new team. <br />
<br />
Second, seeing Kazama go from the &quot;big bully&quot; to learning about why he did what he did. He wasn&#039;t just a gigantic a**hole who crushed people because it was fun. He had a REASON. His backstory showed how much pressure was on him to win. And, towards the end, he remembered how to have fun. That was a pleasure to see.<br />
<br />
Third, and more of a minor thing, is seeing Akuma freed from his chains. His thought process was so single minded that he seemed to have forgot that there was more to life than just ping pong. It seems like a strange thing to say when so much of the show revolves around it, but he found happiness without a wooden paddle.<br />
<br />
Fourth, learning about the character&#039;s backstories was handled exceptionally. Bits and pieces were sprinkled throughout the show, never overwhelming the viewer with one character at a time. And they were put in where they were needed most.<br />
<br />
There was a unique reason for each of these characters to play. They had their flaws, their strengths, their friends, and their foes. There were &quot;main&quot; characters in Peco and Smile, but after seeing Wenge and Kazama and even Akuma develop as I talked about, they felt like just as big parts of the story as Smile and Peco.<br />
<br />
But don&#039;t get me wrong, the culmination of the story was all Smile and Peco. The show did an incredible job of showing why they&#039;re such good friends. It&#039;s not because Peco talks a lot and Smile doesn&#039;t. It&#039;s because Smile was always pushing Peco from the shadows, rooting for his success because he liked seeing his friend happy. And Peco supported Smile by being there for him whenever he was needed. He was the &quot;Hero&quot; in Smile&#039;s life. <br />
<br />
Smile seemed like he was a robot. The joke from the beginning of the show was that he never smiled. Why was this? Why would a kid who seemed to be well off enough never smile? Why did he never go all out against his opponents when he was young? Those questions were presented and answered in a satisfying way.<br />
<br />
Peco was also on a high horse. He didn&#039;t handle getting knocked down as well as Wenge, but the support from the old lady and Smile (although extremely indirectly) let him get back up again. Would he have done the same thing without his friends help? Who knows. The thing is, he had those friends to push him. <br />
<br />
Among those interactions, the psychological aspect of the show was incredibly strong as well. Questions like &quot;Why do we play ping pong?&quot;, &quot;Who do we play for?&quot;, &quot;Is it about having fun or being the best?&quot; caused me to think throughout the entire season and those questions were reflected individually with each character. <br />
<br />
Kazama played because he NEEDED to be the best. He had no alternative. <br />
Akuma played to become like Kazama. He wanted to be that good.<br />
Wenge played because it was his escape. He wanted to go back home.<br />
Smile played because he liked seeing Peco succeed. <br />
Peco played... because it was fun. <br />
<br />
On to the art. Some people might have turned away from this show because of the artstyle. I&#039;m incredibly sad at this realization because a show&#039;s art style doesn&#039;t determine how good it is (see: Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Aku no Hana). It&#039;s a shame so many people are so ingrained in how anime is &quot;supposed&quot; to look that they can&#039;t see the beauty of a different style.<br />
<br />
And this show managed to be beautiful. The art direction, the color changes, the subtle and drastic shifts in tone showed what good directing can do. An art style doesn&#039;t have to be the prettiest in the world to be the best. There are other ways art can take shape. <br />
<br />
Continuing on, the way the art was used throughout the story was truly unique. Giving the characters their own &quot;avatars&quot; in a way, the animators were able to create scenes that added immense value and emotion to some of the scenes where the characters are simply playing ping pong. Dragons, planes, heroes, robots... if someone heard this show out of context, they might think it was an action show. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack was always top notch as well. The opening? Fantastic. An amazing visual and auditory sensation combined into one powerful opening song with lyrics that reinforced the idea of having fun. It was always changing too. From episode to episode, it matched the mood and the tone, even if it seemed silly at times. <br />
<br />
Story was a bit lower than the others because honestly the story was in the characters. At a base level, it can be described as &quot;Ping pong players try to compete for the world championships&quot; but to leave it at that would be doing a huge disservice to the show. The characters made the story. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t express how much I enjoyed this show. After I let it sink in I&#039;ll know a bit better, but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s my favorite of all time now. Every week I was dumbfounded at how a show about ping pong could be so overwhelmingly awesome. The answer is that it wasn&#039;t just about ping pong. It was about the characters as well. <br />
<br />
What I&#039;m going to take away from this show is that ping pong, as well as all sports, is about having fun. If you focus on winning all the time, you&#039;re going to feel hollow and empty inside even if you DO win. And sometimes, we all need a reminder that having fun is the most important thing.<br />
<br />
Even with all its slight flaws I give Ping Pong the Animation a 10/10. The rating says 10 is a masterpiece and I could not agree more with that. If I ever find out how to write to the author of this manga/the studio that made this show I&#039;m going to express my enjoyment and my thanks. They did something utterly amazing.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong, you were truly a show that was enjoyable above all others.<br />
<br />

    Once finished ping pong the animation the first thing i had to do is write this review to help any person who has the slight thought of watching this anime not to do it. It&#039;s awful and THE ONLY REASON someone should see this anime is to fill his own anime list, that&#039;s the only thing this anime is worth for. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
- Story (3/10): Is not that different from others sports anime, both main protagonists smile and peko are pretty good on ping pong, they sign up to the spring tournament in which they both fail, so, they train for several months until

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337453">
        the next tournament comes up and they win, very standard.  <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
- Characters (1/10): Every character is a copy-paste, all of them are extremely cocky and arrogant until of course... they lose a match, suddenly their attitude change <br />
to a more pleasant attitude. THIS IS BS, you can&#039;t even consider this as character development, happens to literally every important character on the anime so you get tired of this very soon. <br />
<br />
About the main character smile, he is a kid on an emo phase in which doesn&#039;t show any emotions with the catchphrase that he only plays for fun and whenever he&#039;s about to lose he just activates the robot mode making him almost  impossible to beat... basically his hidden talent but yet, halfway through the anime he realizes how good he is and then he turns as cocky and arrogant as the other characters making really hard to empathize with him. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
- Dialogues (1/10): First of all, if you going to watch this anime and you have no clue about ping pong whatsoever, I&#039;m sorry for you because only awaits you lot of jargon and technical words about different types of techniques, play styles, serves, types of rubber and rackets... So, you keep watching the anime without any idea of whatever they are saying or pause it and do a research on google about what they are talking about.  <br />
<br />
Separately, the dialogues between characters is very poor and not realistic at all, most of the time they just chit chat no sense, neither plot related. If not, the conversation becomes a bragging competition in a way or another you can easily tell that this is a very low effort to fill because of the short story-plot that this anime has. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
- Art-style ~ Animation (1/10): This is by far the worst of all, awful, I understand that they wanted to be loyal to the manga art style since it&#039;s different, but making something different doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s good, even less this type of art-style on a sports anime. In conclusion, what you get left are really poor animated matches since they are not fluid at all, the movement seems very rusty and at the end it feels like watching a PowerPoint with gifs of two guys bouncing a ball for 4-5 times alongside a ping pong ball sound effect. Once someone scores the score-board suddenly raises to 6 so if you somehow managed to enjoy the match it won&#039;t last for very long because every match lasts in between 15 seconds (less relevant) to 3-4 minutes as much... only excluding ONE match, the semifinal. And that was the good part, the way they animated the fill training episodes it&#039;s way worse. A bunch of really really really low-quality art designed characters as background while seeing just recycled animations and moves episode after episode makes you want to go to sleep and drop the anime instantly. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
- Overall (2/10): The only good thing I could say about the anime is the fact that I didn&#039;t expect who was going to be the winner of the last match on the tournament and caught me by surprise, anything but that it&#039;s just legit garbage. This is a bad anime, you can tell instantly, even if you rate it high or low, this is an overrated anime which you will forget in a couple of days. It does not mark or affect you at all like other animes. Even once you finish it you can&#039;t really have a discussion or a conversation about this anime... because nothing interesting nor entertaining happens. This is not an anime you want to recommend to someone, even if he&#039;s new to anime or someone who has seen 400+ animes, because this anime... It&#039;s just a WASTE of time. Poor Story-line, awful characters/dialogues, the art-style and animation it&#039;s beyond horrendous... <br />
<br />
  <br />
Avoid watching it.  <br />
<br />
  <br />
Every feedback is very helpful... Thanks!

    Ping Pong, a sport that is played on a table. Who knew it could be so compelling when transformed into anime form? At first glance, this show seems like an unattractive piece of work with its oddly drawn looking characters. But that’s only the surface as the complexity of Ping Pong the Animation is more about the animation style. It’s about craftsmanship of a game that revolutionized with in an avant-garde way that is captivating, thought provoking, and mutation from unique to convincing work of art.<br />
<br />
The show makes its entrance fairly straight forward with the competitive sport of ping pong. I am not an active

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156349">
        competitor of the sports myself but the show has the ability to grip your attention with its idiosyncratic style. And despite how complex the characters look at first glance, the story itself is easy to follow. We have two friends sharing a passion for the sport they love, in this case being ping pong. Makoto Tsukimoto and Yutaka Tsukimoto are fine examples of how people compete for success yet seemingly adapts to their love for a hobby. With nicknames such as Smile and Peco, they stand out fairly solid with their personas. <br />
<br />
Besides that point, several distinctive features stands out to make this show memorable. First, we have Masaaki Yuasa, the brainchild behind the show. With his innovative craftsmanship, he compels this show into an enthusiastic style series as previously seen in animation works such as Kaiba, The Tatami Galaxy, and Mind Game. Here, we see his talents again formulated into the world of ping pong, a competitive game that tests the very wits of the competitors. Each superlative movement is carefully made to stand out distinctively to show precision. But more so, we also see motifs whether it’s comparisons to those of a robotic arm or dragon as a form of symbolism of definable nature. <br />
<br />
The first episode shows how Peco meets a prodigy named Wenge (also nicknamed as China from the country of his origin). Coming from the ‘kingdom of ping pong’, we quickly see the gap of strength in the two as China dominates in his match with a clean finish. But behind those devilish eyes and hot-boiled temper is also a man of integrity, who strives to become the best. His complex nature is a highlight in this show that feature several sides to his testament. For one thing, he seemingly has both an inferiority and superiority complex. From the beginning, he looks down on other players for attempting to be on his “equal” such as Peco. On the other hand, he also values players such as Smile as someone that is worthy of being his adversary. And indeed, later episodes shows exactly why Smile is worthy of being called just that. Speaking of which, our main characters Smile and Peco are like columns to the building blocks of characterization. The way Ping Pong the Animation depicts their characters at a fundamental level is appreciable. For instance, Smile is portrayed with characteristics that shows him as a loner and plain man. Throughout the series, it’s shown that he is skilled in the art of ping pong and can be relatable with his realistic style of living life itself. He is honest, has a dynamic relationship with his coach, and even rivals takes him for granted. And despite often behaving in a deadpan manner, Smile can be quite likeable. His nickname also serves as an anti-thesis because he barely ever smiles with his expressionless face behind those eye glowing spectacles. On the other hand, we have Peco, a young boy of eccentricity. Unlike Smile, he is outgoing and is often on the lookout for challenges in his life whether they’d be skilled competitors like China or dealing with countless hours of excruciating training. Even though he has a lack of skill compared to other players in the beginning, one should admire his never diehard attitude through a boy of determination. Peco’s mentor, Obaba sees his honest intentions and pushes him to become what he hopes to be – a player of integrity of admirable efforts. Similarly, Jou Koziumi (nicknamed ‘Butterfly Joe’) values Smile for both his talent and someone that he sees as his younger self. This reflection in his character shows a visage that the show details in solidity through its intriguing characterization, one that is memorable from many angles. Likewise, all the main characters gets their spotlight and their journey to stardom. It’s a ride you won’t forget with their development is what should be valued.<br />
<br />
Of course, ping pong being a competitive sport also means competition. It’s more than just hitting a ball with a racket across the table but rather as a form of art. Each movement requires a methodical play through strategic movements. Some of these are delineated with motifs and spellbinding moments thanks to Yuasa’s innovative style. The symbolism such as the ferocity of a dragon coming from Ryuuichi Kazama (also nicknamed as “Dragon”) shows this at its best during one of his matches in the tournaments. While it may seems like a wild frenzy, it also makes its point to show how intense ping pong can really be. Each competitors’ playing style define their own characteristics and brings about their persona to life. The sportsmanship is also displayed well with accuracy to tell a riotous story. <br />
<br />
A controversial topic relates to the artistic direction of the show. One might interpret it as unfitting. Yet looking from a different angle, it should be seen as more the nature of how it is displayed. In this case, it is unorthodox but with a fitting edge towards its thought provoking story. The characters are presented as complex by nature, complex by attributes, and complex but their playing style. As such, we see this from the artwork of Ping Pong. The way the ping pong ball is hit forward and returned is captured with very fluid animation. The camera angle often focuses on each and every movement in order to illustrate the intensity of the game with hardcore precision. There’s no rush towards the art but instead serves as a purpose of the characters being figures to remember. The artwork in this case is memorable not for its avant-garde style but for the ability to bring out ping pong at its very best. <br />
<br />
Similarly, the soundtrack is also powerhouse that is carefully crafted to fit the characters and the ping pong world. For instance, the OST is intense often configured in rhythm to match each movement with a players’ stroke. The voice actors also show their talents in their field especially for China’s character. As a foreigner and fresh face, he is able to speak both Mandarin and Japanese to solid degrees. I give praise to Yosei Bun for his performance as his debut in the voice acting industry. However, China is not the only character with memorable dialogues. Most if not all the characters’ dialogues are a testament to define how this show stands out to be complex in nature. Their dialogue holds meaning, depth, and dedicates to purpose. Likewise, Smile and Peco’s voices also reflects their personalities in a credible way. Finally, the OP &amp; ED song are more just than catchy. They systemically define the dynamics of its artistic style with appreciable freshness. <br />
<br />
Ping Pong the Animation is a brilliant example based off the manga of the same name that serves as a rare breed to the sports realm. While most sports series captivates on the competitions itself, this show seizes every moment to characterize its players that will be memorable for generations to come. It is mature, realistic, relatable, and compelling. The one aspect I did find somewhat vague and may seem weakly portrayed would be the rules of the actual games. But likewise, this is a story not just being about to beat the man but to be the man. As complex as the characters look, this show is easy to understand with a cunning nature. Even if you feel the final result of their achievements may seem indifferent, it’s what their journey that counts the most with the development. After all, there’s an old saying that goes “the journey is more important than the destination”. And after watching Ping Pong the Animation, I couldn’t agree more.<br />

    Ping Pong: The Animation is one of the most astonishing anime I’ve ever seen. It’s something that could only come out of passion and devotion from an eccentric auteur who prides himself in the unique and extraordinary. Only masters and madmen could produce works as tight and uniquely crafted as this. It’s easy to see why this show is regarded as a masterpiece. Frankly, this anime deserves all the praise it gets.<br />

That’s not to say it will appeal to everyone. The art style is rough. There’s no denying that. It’s so rough that some may call it ugly, ignoring the stellar, often cinematic presentation and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317513">
        wonderful comic book style Yuasa mastered in the process. Some will forego praising the character designs because of the artwork, unable to appreciate how deliberately presented the matches are and how lovely the colors and imagery can be. No two matches are ever the same, and the last two are particularly stunning. They may even write off the show as badly animated despite how well-animated everything is, simply because they don’t like the drawings and because there’s some CGI (a lot of which you may not even notice) and missing faces every now and then. It’s a shame, but even if you find this Tatsunoko Production show ugly, I’d implore you to endure it for the wonderful writing and adrenaline-pumping displays of games and drama permeating each episode. It looks better than you’d expect, and better than many give it credit for.<br />
<br />
Accompanying the often-electrifying matches is the show’s OST composed by Kensuke Ushio. There are several engaging tracks that highlight the immense pressure each game instills on its players and the audience, effectively becoming memorable battle themes in the process. I’m also a fan of the one electronic track that appears in some moments of preparation and speculation in the tournaments, as it adds to the anticipation the show already delivers in spades. The only other memorable song outside of a fun karaoke track in episode 6 and another insert song in the finale, would be the opening. &quot;Tada Hitori&quot; by Bakudan Johnny is a raw and fun track that encapsulates the determination and passion the show’s characters have for the game. The keyboard works perfectly with the guitar, drums, and manly vocals. <br />
<br />
Now to get to what you’re really here for. Ping Pong: The Animation’s character writing is frighteningly good. The show juggles several different character arcs in each episode, with said arcs and characters influencing and interacting with each other in meaningful and standout ways. This happens even when one character’s arc concludes, such as with Manabu the “Demon” who helps a former rival out of his downward spiral after being forced to re-examine himself and his own jealousy. The best part is that all of this is done in the span of 11 22-minute episodes. With such a tight story length and brisk pace, you’d think these character arcs would feel rushed or incomplete. Most of them do not and even those that do feel a tad rushed in places have such minor slip-ups that most people won’t notice or care. You can always see a logical start and end with every single point in each character’s arc, whether that be Wenge Kong’s arrogance and desperation to prove himself to get back on his former team, or Smile’s change from a reserved, almost nihilistic drone playing to pass the time and find some fun in Ping Pong, to a tremendous machine whose ice is gradually thawed. This isn’t even going over Peco’s or Kazuma the Dragon’s arcs, which culminate in one of the best penultimate episodes I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we learn about each character’s playstyle and training regimens. Their backstories are presented with a certain amount of flair even early on before certain players suffer major losses. It avoids the pitfall of explaining everything about a character’s backstory at a life or career-threatening moment, as we learn about them way before their most critical games expand on their backstories once and for all. On top of that, their character dynamics are filled with such vibrancy that these people would take on a life of their own through that alone. They’re all incredibly well-realized and tactile, so their journeys are electrifying. The way their arcs are delicately woven together adds even more chemistry and life to these characters, making their arcs all the more rewarding. It’s because of this that the revelations and conclusions regarding each character in the back half are able to become some of the most hype moments I’ve witnessed all year. Every time a character resigns to his fate, it’s as powerful as a hero’s special move. Fitting given the motif that defines our main leads. I dare not say more. Just know that you’re getting a lot out of this cast in such a short period of time, and that the big matches this anime presents are as moving as some of the best anime fights out there. That’s why the writing’s so daunting and impressive.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of this show that is incredibly intricate and tactile is the world. Exposition dumps about the major schools of Ping Pong are presented through advertisements and through characters trying to encourage our main protagonist “Smile” to join their school. We get to see their training regimens, colors, ethos, and more through careful sprinkles of information or dazzling displays. Characters also often remark on strange fads and trends regarding delicacies like the sudden thinning of soda carbonation or these chocolate bar gimmicks that make the general populous unable to appreciate the basic $1 bar. Even minor characters that get defeated in one episode often get noticeable characterization to them to make this world become even more alive. My favorite example is this one character who is constantly looking for a place where he belongs. Long after he loses his match and he declares his next destination, you see him shifting from ping pong to the beach and then to the mountains, and so on. These are all small details, little touches that make this already vibrant anime even more lively. Nitpicks like the scores not accurately depicting what the anime is conveying regarding certain games, and a few character beats feeling rushed, aren’t enough to take that away from this show.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong is an anime that soars like few ever could. Assuming you’re not averse to the visuals or a quirky style, it’s hard not to get sucked into a show this rich and explosive. It’s daunting how this show can cram so much without feeling bloated. It’s commendable on that aspect alone, but the payoffs to our incredible characters’ arcs make for some of the most glorious and rewarding experiences I’ve had with anime all year. You’ve probably already made your judgment on whether or not to take this anime into consideration long before my meager self stepped into the fray, and there are several more talented writers and reviewers that have sung the praises of this anime to hell and back. However, if you’ve never considered watching this anime before, then I hope this review inspires even one person to do so. I’ll stand among those who have adored this anime, so here’s an invitation to join us.<br />

    By the sixth time the characters talked about how talented and brilliant Tsukimoto is, I had to make sure I wasn’t watching a battle shounen series. At least the observers in Medabots looked anxious and worried. Ikki fought against tough enemies and had to find chinks in their armor. Here, Tsukimoto hits the ball a few times, push up his glasses and walks away. Not smiling did not add depth to the character.<br />
<br />
There’s a brilliant story here somewhere. The story follows a cast that each has a different approach to the sport. This is an archetype that gives you so much do it never gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201491">
        old. Often, the series understands how to use it. There are about five different viewpoints here. Each is unique in its way, and each is presented as reasonable. The creators never rely on caricatures. They rely more on super-talented protagonists and an unorthodox art style that adds nothing.<br />
<br />
Tsukimoto and Peco are both talented people who we are supposed to cheer for because they’re talented. While Peco’s lively energy is fun, it’s not enough to drive a main character. It’s barely a quirk for a supporting one. Tsukimoto is supposed to be unique with how he refuse to smile, but his character never settles on pretentious moron or angsty teenager. Both would’ve been fine, but at best the series makes him the former. It also takes his pretense seriously.<br />
<br />
There is nothing exciting or valueable in being unenthusiastic about life. Tsukimoto walks around with an apathetic expression and doesn’t seem to like anything. His attitude towards life is the same thing that made Joy Division successful, but Joy Division didn’t just sell indifference. They explored that attitude.<br />
<br />
People who reach such a state probably have something in the past that made them this way. They would also lead terribly dull and sad life. The idea that such a person can be so talented is far-fetched. Wouldn’t winning games require some sort of drive? People sometimes hate what they’re good at, but that’s at least an emotion. Ping Pong wants us to believe that a walking embodiment of Joy Division’s classic album is somehow a champion in table tennis.<br />
<br />
A bullying story is tacked on at the end. It’s a predictible story that shows us that the kid was disliked, but never the horrible reality of it. Tsukimoto even gets a cheerful person to stick with him. Both of them turn out to be extremely talented in ping pong. Where’s the struggle?<br />
<br />
Peco faces losing for the first time and gets bummed, but this is where their troubles end. They’re celebrities and heroes in the eyes of everyone, but not heroes that are uncomfortable in their position. They’re not like Kazama, who was driven to succeed to cover up his emotional troubles. Kazama is a champion who uses victories as a way to find happiness that he can’t achieve. His talent is part of his struggle.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong also has a strange view of talent. Talent is something you either have or don’t, and no amount of practice can make up for it. It’s a fatalist view, and not a good one. It could be talent is something you’re born with, but how will you know if you’ll never try to prove it? Indifference like Tsukimoto’s rarely produces noteable people.<br />
<br />
What’s thrilling in such stories is not to see the characters win. All the creators have to do is just write that the characters won. What’s interesting is their struggle, their view on victory and why they’re doing it. Their reaction to losing or winning is what makes things exciting. China, Sakuma and the long-haired dude all have such an arc. One uses the sport to return back home. One uses it to lift up his own low self-confidence. Another one is on an eternal search for meaning.<br />
<br />
Their stories are far more exciting and humane than Tsukimoto’s/Peco’s. They are stories of people like us, rather than two people who found out they’re talented. It’s amazing how similar it is to cookie-cutter heroic stories. Substitute ‘talent in ping pong’ with ‘magic sword’, ‘victory’ for ‘saving the world’ and it turns out the anime isn’t so unique as it looks.<br />
<br />
How it looks is a big discussion point, but not that exciting. The only good thing about it is how unorthodox it is. The character design is a weird take on realism that looks grotesque without bridging the gap. What especially sticks out are the lips, which look huge. The sketchiness also makes the character design inconsistent. In too many scenes, the characters look like blobs.<br />
<br />
This is not minimalism. They look like shapes drawn in a few seconds. The roughness achieves nothing. It could be an expression of the character’s imperfection, but the story disagrees with that. Peco and Tsukimoto are heroic champions. It doesn’t achieve any type of warmth because it’s too stylized and distant. All the rough lines and emphasized lips don’t give it the elegant simplicity that saved Mushishi’s character design. Being different is great, but if it doesn’t contribute to the story it’s just a fancy cover. There’s nothing particularly unusual about it other than a sketchy look that achieves nothing.<br />
<br />
The animation is different, and Ping Pong fares better there. The series overcomes one of anime’s main flaws – its static animation. Most anime are fairly static, with more focus on design rather than motion. While Ping Pong fails in design, it’s a total success in kinetic energy. The Ping Pong matches are stylized action scenes that rely on visual expressions, not coherency.<br />
<br />
Animating a sports match as it looks in reality is pointless. If you want to watch a real game, you’ll watch a real one. The only reason we watch a sports story is because of what the sport means to the characters. Each match is animated with focus on its place in the character development. The matches are the same in what happens in them. They all consist of people hitting the ball. The difference between them is the meaning, and so every match is an engrossing action scene that leaves everything else in the dust. It doesn’t just set the blueprint for how to animate sport scenes but how to animate action scenes in general.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong is not the peak of anime. It’s not even among the more unusual of its type. Despite trying to create its own rules, not enough of them serve the story and it falls back on sport prodigies. The exploration of that type doesn’t go deep enough. Still, it has a great cast of side-characters and fantastic action scenes. Its attempts at understanding its cast are admirable, and so it relies more on developed characters than emotional manipulation. It’s not a milestone, but there’s enough to enjoy here.<br />
<br />
