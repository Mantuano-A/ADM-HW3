    Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai (I Want to Eat Your Pancreas) is predictable, heavy-handed, unoriginal, and, yet, I still love this film. I do not love the movie in any sort of guilty-pleasure way either; I unironically think Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is one of the best anime films I have ever seen. Why, though? Well, the film uses its predictability, heavy-handedness, and unoriginality to craft a message that is so unbelievably powerful, and it struck a chord with me and left my emotions in absolute, complete shambles. I honestly doubt most people could misinterpret the themes of Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, so

        I also want to try and dig into why this movie hits so hard, for so many.<br />

Spoiler Warning: I am going to spoil the entire movie (but so does the movie itself). If you choose to opt out here, know that I highly recommend this film.<br />

There are two main themes of Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai. The first is spelled out on for us on the heroine’s, Sakura’s, dairy, “Living with Dying.&quot; Sakura has a pancreatic illness that will eventually cut her life short. As anyone would be in this predicament, Sakura is terrified. She tries to come to terms with her situation and live her remaining days as the same carefree girl she was before. Everyone’s time will eventually end, and, unfortunately for Sakura, her time will end a bit earlier than most. No one knows when they will die though—not even Sakura. Before her illness can even take her life, Sakura is stabbed in the streets and dies at the age of seven-teen. The film clearly sets up Sakura’s death to be an abrupt one, but this was the one event that even caught me slightly off-guard. The first scene of the movie is Sakura’s funeral, so, just like Sakura, the viewer is supposed to enter the story with the acceptance of her death, but, just like Sakura, we struggle to. No matter what, death will always be sudden, frightening, and sad. The way the film handles Sakura’s death should have be obvious to the viewer, but even if you see it coming, it still somehow catches you off guard, just like Sakura. Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai weaves Sakura’s feelings into the viewing experience itself and forces the viewer to empathize with her situation. If the movie did its job, the viewer will be sobbing by the end of the film, just like Haruki.<br />
<br />
Without Haruki, Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai would be a hollow experience. Sakura’s story might be powerful, but it is Haruki’s that is truly moving. Prior to meeting Sakura, Haruki is a shell of person. He has no personality, no emotions, and he shuts himself off from the rest of the world. Sakura is the first person to really open up to him, and throughout the time Haruki spends with Sakura, although reluctant, he slowly starts to open up to her. For the first time in his life, Haruki makes a connection with someone else. Haruki knows that Sakura will not be around for much longer, but just like everyone else, he cannot handle losing her. After her death, Haruki starts to close himself off again, but he is not the same person as before he met Sakura. Haruki starts to realize how difficult being alone really is and starts pursuing other relationships. Although Sakura is gone, her impact on the people around her, especially Haruki, will remain. Haruki is meant to be a surrogate character for the viewer, and, because he so basic at the start of the movie, he is extremely easy to project yourself onto. At the emotional climax of the film, Haruki breaks down into tears alongside the viewer, strengthening the bond the two share and makes the following message of “the importance of connections” hit even harder.<br />
<br />
No doubt, the story of Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is constructed with the main purpose of eliciting specific emotions and sending home simple, but still important, messages, and the production does more of the same. The film has strong animation and direction, but the real standout is the music. Although the OST has a few solid tracks itself, the most memorable part is definitely the handful of songs done by Sumika. They do the OP, ED, and an insert song during a pivotal scene, and all of them hammer home the emotions being felt by the viewer and adds even more to an already great experience.<br />
<br />
I recognize that Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is not the film some people want it to be. The movie is certainly a shallow one: predictable, heavy-handed, and unoriginal. Although the movie might be simple, it is still effective. Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is not the type of movie that is supposed to spark discussion (even though I am still doing it lul), it evokes a feeling and leaves impact. In my opinion, two movies that tackle similar themes better are Colorful and Koe no Katachi, but both of them are certainly more flawed than Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai. Actually, I consider both those other two to be in my top-ten anime of all time, so hopefully by me considering Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai to be their equal, you can understand how much I truly do love and recommend this film.

    Say what you want about this movie being generic or being acclaimed only because it is a “tearjerker”, but I don’t care. I loved this movie, and I cried my eyes out. The reason people love tearjerkers is because people want to be moved. We want to experience something that will truly take us away from our lives and make us feel something so strong that we are moved to tears. This movie did just that. In an effort to avoid spoiling anything for anyone, I won’t write about the climax and ending, but it was unexpected. That said, I couldn’t imagine it ending any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296138">
        other way. This was a beautiful portrayal of a genuinely unique and  special relationship between two people. I highly recommend it!

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
&#039;I Want to Eat Your Pancreas&#039; is a common drama production to this industry. It offers generic school settings with rather superficial teenage characters. The only thing it tries to accomplish is toy with its viewers&#039; emotions to the point of some cheap tearjerking. Those who are okay with this will most definitely see how the movie accomplishes exactly all the thing it wants to. Those who want something more from anime, should look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
This movie is a story about death. It starts when the most perfect mary sue on the planet starts randomly talking with a no-life loser dude who happens to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287884">
        her classmate. Our characters start frequently interacting with each others and supposedly grow close. They hang out and talk about dying all the time. That&#039;s pretty much the entirety of their relationship. It feels random and forced and unnatural. <br />
<br />
Our dude is dense and has never had any friends during his pathetic life.. that&#039;s pretty much him. Our girl is really perfect and chill and that&#039;s also pretty much her. The catch being that she will die soon which further makes these two character - who are the opposites of each others (according to the narration at least) - even more the opposite because the dude is actually alive. Great. <br />
<br />
The drama is a separate entity in the work, mainly because it is there constantly whispering to the characters --and especially to its viewers ears-- that shit will go down, just wait and see. Since the great twist is obvious from the start, the whole thing relies on the journey... where nothing spectacular ever happens and the characters feel more like meridians that try to connect the viewers to the emotions.<br />
<br />
One could defend most of the events by looking it more from the characters perspective. I found this to be quite hard as they don&#039;t feel like real, genuine people at all. If they did, it would be understandable for our heroine to open up to a stranger, as to most people, it&#039;s often easier to talk with 3rd parties than to people close to you. Especially the whole fear of death is amazing as a concept, but I don&#039;t really see it as anything more than waste of potential in this case.<br />
<br />
The whole main dude realizing that people actually die in real life is definitely quite an interesting idea as well.. at least to those who have never experienced this type of thing or considered that all of this could happen to literally anyone. I doubt any person who is aware of how fragile thing person&#039;s existence is, can find this specific work do them any further waking up enlightenment, other sudden realization of such things or offer much feels at all. If this movie ever serves someone, it&#039;s those viewers who are unaware of how life works, and instead of following our characters for what they are, fall into self-insert. This is one of the rare things with what the author seems self-aware of, as they say &quot;to live is to empathize with someone.&quot; And moreover, named the male lead simply &quot;boku&quot; which means &quot;I/me&quot;. <br />
<br />
There are also several other things I&#039;d want to complain about. Like the claim in narration that our characters are &quot;pure and innocent.&quot; Which is really just a try hard attempt on making the viewer accept these thoughts, but the content (teenagers and alcohol) and our characters behavior (random snapping incidents) among several other scenes is the polar opposite of what I&#039;d considered to be either of these things.. which further makes me question the author&#039;s ability to even recognize their own work for what it is. I can&#039;t say I feel very respected as a viewer when such contradictions exist in the narration.. or perhaps my comprehension of &quot;pure&quot; just differs with the writer.<br />
<br />
Our writing is practically a collection of romance cliches. The only remotely original things are the concepts which it deals rather poorly with. Every event, every side character archetype and every moment that drives the story and the relationship development onward, is loaned content. There is not a single thing any romance fan hasn&#039;t seen at least 50 times before, and not only that, but the execution is so lame that I would call it offensively bad if the work managed to be less bland, but unfortunately it&#039;s not even worth of getting mad over.<br />
<br />
If this had been 50 episodes long tv series that offered a real character portray to both of our main characters and their life, connected them, dealt with the same heavy themes. all the copy-pasted events and cliches had been abandon and the story was written by Adachi Mitsuru: this could have been the best drama the anime industry has to offer. Now it mainly looks like a random, shallow past story from any fighting tournament shonen from Nanatsu no Tanzai to Naruto except there is no character depth present in this movie and therefore it is significantly worse than let&#039;s say zero arc from Fairy Tail which dealt with rather similar concept.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br />
<br />
A lot of anime fans seem to be under the impression that as long as some sort of tragedy is featured and said tragedy happens to a cute girl, an anime automatically qualifies as “good” with its flaws being dismissed due to its label as a ‘tearjerker’ or ‘feels’ anime. Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, or ‘I Want to Eat Your Pancreas’, is a recent addition to this label and, while falling into the same traps as many of its predecessors, the movie manages to accumulate even more flaws on its own, resulting in something that is ultimately underwhelming.<br />
<br />
[Note: This review was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292120">
        written following the movie’s premiere in Australian cinemas. I have not read the source material. Once again, the review is NOT spoiler-free]<br />
<br />
STORY: 4/10<br />
Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai’s story, having been done dozens of times before, is very basic: it revolves around an unnamed protagonist (let’s call him Character A) as he spends time with Yamauchi Sakura, a popular classmate whose days are numbered due her terminal pancreatic disease. As Character A helps Sakura ticks off her bucket list, he develops a close relationship and eventually falls for her. Following her death, Character A breaks free of his shell and learns to befriend those around him. On the surface, the plot structure is sound and has the potential to pull the audience’s heartstrings, if done right. <br />
<br />
Except it wasn’t.<br />
<br />
By treading ground on what has been done to death before in the plot department, Pancreas exposes itself to the risk of being extremely predictable. While this is not inherently a flaw, the movie’s presentation seems to be fully set on sapping the enjoyment of the audience, being narrated in the most uninteresting way possible by Character A. While one could argue for his lack of energy in the delivery of lines to be tied to his characterisation, it doesn’t change that Character A’s monotony worked against the intended emotional impact of many scenes.<br />
<br />
And yet, this wasn’t the biggest issue with the plot. In fact, for something so cliché, Pancreas’s greatest vice, ironically, is its attempt to subvert audience’s expectations.<br />
<br />
Given the synopsis, most people in the audience would expect the movie to eventually lead to Sakura and Character A’s tearful farewells as she lets go of her last breath on a hospital bed, succumbing to her illness with a satisfied smile on her face. Although this is very conventional, it would have worked. However, in the actual movie, Sakura died from being stabbed off-screen. Yes, stabbed. By a serial killer on the loose.<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
There is no excuse for this “twist”. Even if the killer did not appear out of nowhere (thanks to an extremely poor attempt at “foreshadowing” or Chekhov’s gun or whatever earlier in the movie), to remove Sakura from the story in this way is, at best, questionable, and, at worst, utterly nonsensical. One could greatly reach in linking this stupid development to the philosophical message that “death may come from every corner” but the sheer silliness of the situation completely nullifies the intended emotional effect. When you look past the shock value, all that remains is, quite frankly, comical.<br />
<br />
After this shocking twist, the plot quickly resumes its original course until the conclusion, leaving much to be desired due to the lack of originality and monotonous presentation.<br />
<br />
ART: 7/10<br />
Pancreas’s art is conventional but pleasing to look at. Except for Character A (who looks completely unremarkable), the character design is serviceable. Background art for the movie is quite good and up to the expected standard of a theatrical anime production. Animation is nothing exceptional for the most part aside from a couple sequences that are animated in much more detail. A minor complaint is the movie’s use of still-shots montages, which cheapens the audience’s impression of the movie’s production.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7/10<br />
The best part of the movie. sumika did a great job with the opening and ending songs, and the OST, while nothing exceptional, did its job when required.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 3/10<br />
Character A is a blatant self-insert for the audience. From the generic ‘anime male high school student’ design to demeanour, he is utterly unremarkable as a character for most of the movie’s running time. He has little personality on the outside, exuding no energy in his narration and interaction with other characters. While the behaviour is not completely unrealistic considering that he is a loner, it makes for a jarring watching experience as the audience is forced to follow the perspective of someone who almost never expresses his opinion. The lack of more extensive inner monologue makes the unnamed protagonist hard to relate to or like. On the rare occasions that Character A vocalises something other than some form of “Yes”, a large amount of his dialogue revolves around the gag that he has no friends. While it was somewhat funny (in a sad way) at first, the excessive repetition of this character trait got old very quickly and only highlights how little Character A has going for him outside of his status as the outsider in the class. As a result, the development that Character A later received after Sakura’s death felt unnatural and forced due to plot reasons.<br />
As for Sakura, the movie desperately tries to sell her as an emotionally fragile girl hiding behind a carefree mask. In reality, her character is never effectively explored past the ‘cutesy anime girl’ act. How the movie examines the more sensitive side of Sakura’s psyche is anything but subtle, with her telling Character A (and the audience by extension) outright that she was fragile underneath her cheerful demeanour. With that being the case, Sakura is more like a caricature of a person close to death rather than a relatable character to be invested in. Pancreas’s failure to bring out and develop Sakura’s character in a poignant way is a major reason why the movie lacks any meaningful emotional impact and fails as a ‘tearjerker’.<br />
<br />
The relationship between the two characters is questionable, to say the least. By conventional (anime) logic, the combination of a quiet character (Character A) and a lively character (Sakura) provides an ideal environment for them to play off each other’s personality traits. Yet, there is little dynamic between the them, to the point that one must wonder how the relationship is able to sustain itself without the plot requiring it to. Character A appears perpetually uninterested in pretty much everything he does, as if he was sick of her shenanigans. Interestingly, this is probably the most realistic and interesting part of his character considering Sakura’s characterisation. She acts selfishly and becomes increasingly more obnoxious as the movie goes on, forcing Character A to tag along with her to anything she feels like. Despite his reluctance, Character A always plays along with Sakura’s whims anyway, the cause of which can be traced to Sakura’s regular mentions of her dying soon in a cheerful demeanour. All this shows is that Sakura is manipulative and is constantly guilting Character A into feeling bad for her. The impact of Sakura’s unnecessarily cruel antics comes to a boiling point during the bedroom scene. While the protagonist’s behaviour is undoubtedly wrong, Sakura is not at all faultless in bringing about the situation. What is more disappointing is that this MAJOR conflict, despite its serious implications on the nature of the relationship, is not explored in a meaningful way at all. Instead, it is trivialised and resolved lazily with the intervention of a third party: Sakura’s ex who serves no other purpose other than uniting the main couple through his douchebaggery (and waltzing out of existence as soon as he accomplishes his mission). Sakura’s selfish behaviour is, once again, played off lightly as part of her being a cute anime girl and Character A never stops to think for himself or reconsiders participating in the toxic relationship.<br />
<br />
The side characters of Pancreas are unnecessary and insignificant in the grand scheme of the plot. Kyoko, Sakura’s best friend, incessantly harasses the unnamed protagonist for hanging out with Sakura. Worse yet, she never attempts to sort out their differences, perceiving the protagonist in an overly negative light that is never justified due to her lack of characterisation. Takahiro, Sakura’s ex, serves no purpose but to resolve the climactic conflict between the two main characters, appearing in a total of two scenes in the movie. Without exaggeration, he disappears and is never heard from again after he fulfils his role. The most mindboggling side character is, without a doubt, Miyata, not for any of his personal intrigue but for the sheer pointlessness of his inclusion in the movie. For anime with a school setting, the dumb sidekick character has traditionally been a staple. With that said, Miyata does not even satisfactorily fulfil that role. He has nothing resembling a relationship with Character A, only occasionally offering him gum and getting refused. While his character’s action can be interpreted to mirror Character A’s growth as a character, what is presented to the audience falls short, resulting in a pointless, random and unnecessary husk of a character. None of the side characters has any business being included in the movie considering their (lack of) characterisation and nothing would have changed in the grand scheme of things if Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai only revolved around the unnamed protagonist and Sakura.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 4/10<br />
Despite my low initial expectations, I left the cinema feeling wholly disappointed. From feeling bored at how cliché everything was since minute one, I was aggravated by how in-your-face the movie got as it went on, treating the audience like complete idiots who could not think for themselves. The philosophical statements on life and death from the main characters are shallow, bringing nothing new to a topic that has been done to death already. From an emotional perspective, Pancreas falls flat, its supposedly climatic or shocking moments eliciting little due to how unrelatable the main characters are. Overall, Pancreas was unenjoyable and had me wondering when the movie was going to finish as it trudges through a tired, uninspired narrative.<br />
<br />
Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai – Final Score: 5/10.<br />

    &quot;I Want to Eat Your Pancreas&quot; is one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen! <br />
<br />
There will be spoilers! This review goes out to people who have seen the movie. If you liked it, please note that this is my own opinion, no need to bash on me. If you disliked it then this review is for you. <br />
<br />
This movie starts off with our main girl, who is annoying, very annoying. She has no manners, forgets about the rules of the library (basically shouts all the time and annoys readers around her), and does not respect main character&#039;s privacy. She also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301799">
        just butts in situations she has no business in, just to make an epic scene happen for the sake of the viewers&#039; entertainment. An example of this would be kicking the ass of a law breaker whom she had no business with, and whom we forget about for the rest of the movie, including 90% of all other characters introduced at the beginning of the movie. Yeah, this movie does not know how to handle all other characters aside from the annoying main characters. What was that scene supposed to even mean? Aside from some entertainment value, it&#039;s basically filler. <br />
<br />
The main girl is also illogical, as one who is in the face of death should not be acting all happy and dandy. In fact, people who enjoy their life like main girl does, should be terrified of their disease. She does confess an hour into the movie that she is actually afraid, that behind all that annoying, awful character, there is a sad emo girl. The problem with this is that a movie should be introducing how the main characters feel at the beginning of the movie, not an hour later! So at the beginning I thought she was legitemately retarded. She barely gets development, but atleast the movie had the decency to give us a normal human trait from her. <br />
<br />
The main girl just becomes attached to the main guy of the movie for no reason at all, other than him being a quiet guy that says nothing and barely forms relationships with others, if any at all. This reason for her to become attached to him is stupid. Do the writers live in an illogical fantasy land? Isn&#039;t this movie supposed to be realistic? Then why the bloody hell does a girl on the face of death approach a boy so suddenly and tell him everything? She likes him? Well, nobody does that, clearly the writer of this story has never talked to a woman, or he&#039;s just straight up making shit up to advance the plot. Which one is it do you think? There is a clear plothole here, she could&#039;ve talked to him before her disease, but clearly the boring plot would be more boring then, the writer thought. <br />
<br />
The main girl keeps getting more annoying. Listen, I like me some love and romance in a story, I like me some two characters sharing that positive energy... but when one is not interested in the other, it just becomes annoying, awkward and just flat out abuse. The guy is so disinterested in main girl&#039;s talks, her quotes and everything she does. He&#039;s mentioned several times that he does not like forming relationships with people, and he has shown several signs of not being intrigued by whatever main girl says. An example of this being in a coffee shop, after he says nothing while she keeps on rambling, she decides to ask him for his number, he refuses several times but she does not accept it. There is clearly some form of abuse here. Main boy keeps calmly telling her that she can stay with him all she wants, but he does not want to form relationships with anyone, because he&#039;s okay with people observing him and not talking to him. I like main boy because he&#039;s logical and is the only one in this movie who isn&#039;t much of a walking stereotype or does things that annoy me. Main girl ofcourse keeps forcing him to do stuff he does not want to do, and he is too much of an idiot to say no. I&#039;m really surprised, for someone who reads all those books, he barely can spit out a word to save his life. <br />
<br />
Other girls are suddenly introduced to be main girl&#039;s friends, and voilà! She is suddenly the popular girl while main guy is a loser all of a sudden. These girls happen to be the meanest ... sorry, what I meant to say is that these girls are mean, as they start telling the main girl how she should live her life and saying that the guy is unworthy of her... ugh... lame. Mr. Perfetto appears and he is supposed to represent the guy all girls should go out with, I&#039;ve seen this done so many times that it has become so lame now. That guy and those girls don&#039;t even get development, they are just walking stereotypes who get forgotten 10 minutes later! In fact, we think that main girl is alone for a while, but turns out the next scene she has trillions of friends, none of which get developmennt or are introduced in a better way in this sorry excuse of a movie. If the movie had started out introducing each character instead of the immediate introduction we got, we might as well be better off at understanding everything and relating to the characters. Unfortunately, this movie just relies on cheesy feel good moments and good visuals to make up for it&#039;s lack of character development. One of the girls keeps getting annoying, she bulges in when the two main characters are having a good time at a restaurant, and starts telling main girl how she should live her life and who she should date, infront of main boy. They see him as a piece of filth so much so that they talk smack about him infront of his face. This is clearly abuse, and this is the scene where I started to hate the main guy, because he is nothing more than a pathetic loser who can&#039;t stand up for himself. <br />
<br />
The plot continues with the main girl belittling our protagonist on the train, writing his name down in her diary even though he does not want that, and teasing him by choosing only one room they have to share with each other, instead of two rooms. With the amount of times main boy has rejected main girl, I think she should get the idea, either her disease is causing her to become stupid or she&#039;s just hoping to God Senpai notices her. Main girl plays the Truth or Dare game with main character, he chooses truth, she asks him which girl in their class would he like to go out with, he chooses a girl other than her... by now she should get the idea. Main character does not want to go out with her, he sees her only as a friend, he insists on staying alone, yet she insists otherwise. Atleast we get to see some interactions, and we get to know little of main girl&#039;s past. We finally get to know that main girl is actually afraid of death, this movie needed 50 minutes to finally tell us she is somewhat human. <br />
<br />
During the morning main girl&#039;s very annoying, barely developed plot device of a bestie calls and nothing has changed, she still belittles a guy who has never done anything wrong to her. So far, the movie has made me feel all the wrong emotions (Hint: One of them is hate) <br />
<br />
Main character&#039;s bestie then appears out of nowhere, verbally abuses main character and gives him a history lesson about main girl and how she feels, then throws his book down a building and gives him some nice death threats for that cherry on top. You know that feeling where you literally want to be in somebody&#039;s place? Well, I wanted to be in main character&#039;s place so I could have given her a nice slap on that ugly face of hers, maybe then she would have woken up from whatever fantasy land she was living in. Two things angered me about this scene: <br />
<br />
1. She did not even wait for him to do anything wrong to the girl, she just abused him and threw his book even though he still hasn&#039;t hurt anyone.<br />
<br />
2. Had he lived up to bestie&#039;s standards of what a perfect guy should be like, she would have been treating him nicely. The way she was drooling over Mr. Steal your girl earlier should tell you that I&#039;m right. <br />
<br />
I dropped the movie five minutes after that scene because I just did not care anymore. This movie is stupid, lazy, barely makes sense and has annoying characters. Even main boy became annoying, it&#039;s okay to not want to socialize but not standing up for yourself is just flat out pathetic. Had the movie shaped him up to have anxiety then I would have understood why he didn&#039;t defend himself, but he clearly has no problem dealing with people so why didn&#039;t he defend himself? It just doesn&#039;t make sense. The movie does not give two damns about it&#039;s characters, all of them are devices to move a boring plot forward. I don&#039;t even care about reviewing the visuals or anything. <br />
<br />
This movie is an insult to Anime. Avoid this movie at all costs.

    Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, also known by the English title &quot;I want to eat your pancreas&quot;, is a drama anime film with tragedy. It is about an outgoing girl who has a pancreatic illness which she has not told anyone except her family that she has this illness. A boy from her class stumbles upon her diary that she left in the hospital and she comes back to fetch the diary only to realise that he read it so she ends up telling him about her illness. Due to this secret knowledge of theirs that none of their classmates know about, they start to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292295">
        grow closer. Sakura Yamauchi, the girl with the pancreatic illness, notices that the boy is a bookworm and does not talk with anyone and does not have any friends so she feels she has some sort of duty to become friends with him and change him for the better. This all sounds good on paper, but it falls short due to the way this film was structured along with other things that this review will touch on. Some scenes felt out of place and did not add much too the film&#039;s main story.<br />
<br />
The animation of this film was quite disappointing. It seems that this anime film didn&#039;t have much of a budget and a lot of the animation was quite lazy. This film was very much heavy in dialogue to make up for the still shots of animation that had a pan effect on the cinematography showing several still animated shots in one after another that conveyed the character&#039;s activities rather than animating their movements. This made the movie tell the story verbally rather than showing it to us and it felt very lazy. Due to this sequence of several still shots throughout the film, it felt very rushed in terms of pacing as it was evident they were trying to squeeze as much as they could into this film.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was not memorable and the opening theme was just shoved into the film in a distracting and &quot;pushy&quot; way. The voice actors did a good job though. No real complaints in that department.<br />
<br />
Character development was okay. It could have been a lot better. I liked how they symbolised the unwillingness of opening up doors for friendship with the rejection of taking gum when offered by a classmate. I thought that added a nice little metaphorical touch to the anime film. Where this film lacks though is the reasoning with the actions of the cast in this film. I could not get fully emotionally invested in the relationship between the two main characters as their attitudes and emotions seemed to have a convenient &quot;light switch&quot; wherever it was convenient for the plot to do so. Yamauchi&#039;s best friend was a character in this film which was included just to add unnecessary drama to this anime film which could have been a bittersweet tale with more character development on the main characters&#039; relationship but it decided to be more of a rivalry with attention and dictatorship of who Yamauchi should be friends with or the reasons as to why the other characters do not open up to the introverted boy. <br />
<br />
I still found some enjoyment watching it as there were sweet moments that occurred in this anime film. It&#039;s just a shame that it was tainted by the poorly written aspects of this anime film. <br />
<br />
I found this anime to be similar to another anime called Your Lie in April, particularly with the motivations, actions and relationships that are conveyed in both anime. I would suggest watching Your Lie in April instead of this if you have the patience of watching an anime series rather than a film. I cannot recommend this anime unless you find deep enjoyment watching growing friendships within characters that is interlaced with tragedy. <br />
<br />
If you do end up watching this anime film, stay to the end of the film as there is a post-credit scene which does make the film a little bit better and adds a better conclusion to the ending before the credits roll.<br />

    See you can make a memorable modern movie if you want too Japan! Made by a studio who nobody even heard about it &quot;I want to eat your pancreas&quot; is a rare gem that everyone must see! Like Frank Sinatra&#039;s song &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; I too was a stranger before coming across this movie. This movie is a letter of love addressed to life who despite being short is damn gorgeous!<br />
<br />
A strong point in this movie is how simple and enjoyable  it manages to present the story for its audience. The strong willed female lead character made the story so damn enjoyable and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296199">
        managed to steal my heart with her charisma and interactive personality. Her selfish and stubborn way of doing things is what makes her attractive. <br />
A weak point in this movie is the cgi used in some scenes and the side characters who have almost zero influence across the whole movie, some of them managed only to annoy me and ruined my enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Simple stuff between two friends done on a free day or after school is used to establish a bond between Sakura and Haruki, our two main characters.While their bond doesn&#039;t cross the limits of &quot;best friends&quot; they still have something that cannot be described by words, something that keeps them for falling apart.Together they experience new feelings and start to change and view the world with a different perspective. Despite being of opposite personalities like &quot;ying and yang&quot;, spending more and more time together they come to understand each other and change as time passes on.<br />
<br />
The dialogue is damn enjoyable and filled with some beautiful poetry about the value of life and meaning of love.The visuals and ost blends with the dialogue and enforces a variety of emotions that bloom like a beautiful flower. I was looking forward each time Sakura was sharing her thoughts, her feelings, her perception about life. Like Frankie&#039;s song &quot;My Way&quot; she did everything with in her own way, and that&#039;s what I love about her! <br />
While  Haruki is uninteresting as a character and person, his growth after his &quot;fateful&quot; encounter with Sakura is worth mentioning, his change made me see him in a positive light after finishing the movie.<br />
<br />
I gave this a 10 because of the strong female lead character,because of simple and how  beautiful they executed the main themes and because this movie was honest with me until the end, nothing stopped me from enjoying every minute. I experienced a lot of emotions watching this movie and one of them is hope that somewhere out-there I can meet a person that can understand me for what I really am someday. This is why I love anime and always appreciate and praise good works that manage to stir up different emotions and leave a good impression for us, the viewers.<br />

    This Is my first time writing a review. <br />
<br />
I think “I want to eat your pancreas” is a 10/10 Movie. The character development was handled very beautifully and It put a lot of depth into them. The art style was amazing, kinda like the art style of “A silent voice”, and the writing was amazing. The OST and sounds were also very good. The name of the movie, “I want to eat your pancreas” comes from an old superstition where if there was something wrong with a certain body part, if you eat that same body part it will become better. Even though it has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364388">
        cliches and may be a bit unoriginal. I still think “I want to eat your pancreas “is a masterpiece that creates a message that is so unbelievably powerful, and it hit me hard and left my emotions absolutely broken, and It was the only movie that made me tear up. The movie revolves around 2 people, a very energetic and cheerful girl, named sakura, and a gloomy highschool student who, due to spoilers I won&#039;t name. The gloomy boy stumbles upon a diary in a hospital called “Living with Dying” and finds out about a deep secret about our other protagonist, Sakura. She explains to him that she&#039;s just a normal girl living her normal life, going to school and hanging out with friends. She explains how she doesn’t want her terminal illness to affect the way she lives, and they agreed to keep it a secret as she hasn’t told any of her friends about it yet. Although It may seem like a sad story like dying, it&#039;s far from that. It&#039;s a story about what it means to be living. What I enjoyed about this movie was their relationship. Their relationship was way more complex than a romantic one. They are complete opposites that balance each other out, He was an Introvert, while she was an Extrovert. Despite this they start to form a relationship, as he brings her a sense of normalcy in her life, and she’s the real connection he&#039;s ever had. They start to form a bond, where they slowly start to depend on each other, and influence each other, and they become two people who are very important to one another. And what made me sad was that even though the movie opened up with her funeral so we would know that she would die to prevent us from getting hurt. As they spend time with each other you can&#039;t help but open up and grow attached to that character, and realize that you don’t want that inevitable thing to happen, even though it&#039;s just a matter of time. What made it sadder was even though she was living her life normally and acting like everything was ok, she was extremely terrified of her inevitable death. <br />
<br />
This is definitely one of my favorite movies, and I highly recommend this movie!<br />

    I have never given my opinion about anything in MAL. But honestly, I had to make an exception here.<br />
<br />
-  I want to eat your pancreas.<br />
<br />
Impressed, amazed, fascinated and grateful. There aren&#039;t words to describe the wonderful way in which this was carried out. A story where we don&#039;t even need the name of the protagonist to feel identified; to be in his place.<br />
<br />
You could call it one more movie. But, for me it&#039;s a masterpiece made with a lot of love and commitment. It&#039;s so real. 5 minutes is enough to focus your attention to the facts. It exposes us to a form of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296730">
        love so pure, so reciprocal, so... correct, that we all should take a moment to think and reflect on it.<br />
<br />
The characters are minimally stereotyped, but what about that? Even they&#039;re not perfect, &#039;cause they&#039;re human.<br />
<br />
━━ What does it mean to live?<br />
<br />
It exceeded my expectations. This &quot;spring&quot; is worth every minute. I recommend it with all my honey for anyone in the world who wants to feel a little more human.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll leave here the most important premise:<br />
➤ Be proud of what you do every day. However small it is, try to feel if that&#039;s the best you can do. And if it&#039;s not like that, strive to be always with your head held high.<br />
<br />
Little spoiler/recommendation:<br />
If you want to appreciate the ending even more, read &quot;The Little Prince&quot;; comes a point at which so many things happen on the screen that only once is not enough.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s all,<br />
Thanks for reading me♪.<br />

    I enjoy clichéd, predictable tearjerkers as much as the next person (honestly, I do), but not like this. Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai chooses to explore how we live out our relationships with others in the face of death, and does so by presenting a questionable relationship in the first place.<br />
<br />
— Art &amp; Sound —<br />
At best, the art is inconsistent, and at worst, it&#039;s fully distracting. If you want to trace my confusion at the character art as you watch, pay attention to their noses. Sometimes Sakura looks like she has no nose, and sometimes she looks normal. When facing forward, they have little dots

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300549">
        for noses, and their mouths are a little line.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this seems nitpicky, but where it bothered me the most is that Sakura is apparently pretty, while our male protagonist is supposedly not on par, which is something I had to gather from dialogue rather than just looking at them (because they have the same mouths and noses), which felt wrong, and definitely avoidable. The backgrounds at times looked really clean and gorgeous, and at other times we were given a sequence of lifeless still shots. It was an overall confusing experience for the eyes, and ended up feeling lazy, even if some of the scenes were really great.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was fine although not memorable, and the film may have benefitted from a stronger one given that its other areas were lacking.<br />
<br />
— Story &amp; Characters —<br />
Sakura and Generic Quiet Boy&#039;s interactions make up most of the movie, and, boy, these two are real weirdos, aren&#039;t they?<br />
<br />
Sakura laughs at almost everything he says (at him, not with him, thankfully, since he&#039;s not ever being funny), and sometimes she&#039;s just laughing at her own words because she&#039;s just that outgoing and bubbly, I guess. She yanks him into several scenarios where he is either not reacting or assumably uncomfortable (honestly, I don&#039;t know what he&#039;s supposed to be expressing half the time), but this is meant to be endearing somehow.<br />
Generic Boy is purposefully an empty character that we, as viewers, are meant to project ourselves upon. We could argue this is for the sake of properly feeling out the emotional aspect of our tearjerky drama, but let&#039;s be honest and call it what it is — at best, lazy, and at worst, pandering. Apart they are your clichéd and average spunky, adventurous girl and introverted, isolated boy, but together they are truly... confusing. I am not so sure how a very simple and commonly used trope got construed this weirdly.<br />
<br />
Almost every exchange of dialogue overall felt unnatural, save for the conversations between parent and child, which make up maybe a few minutes total of screen time. This shows more clearly in how side characters interact with the two main protagonists, because they mostly only exist to force us to sympathize with the main couple, so at times their words and actions appear extreme and unjustified. <br />
<br />
What kills me about this is that the story itself is not a bad one, albeit unoriginal, but it doesn&#039;t work very well without a strong cast of characters, which we weren&#039;t given. There was a more philosophical piece that got pushed onto us towards the end, and at one point Sakura basically verbalizes exactly what the film is trying to say. In other words, there was a good message about our connections with others and death somewhere lost in an hour and 40 minutes of runtime, but it was muddled in unrealistic dialogue and unfounded feelings between characters, so it&#039;s hard for me to take seriously.<br />
<br />
— Concluding Thoughts —<br />
I can cry at almost everything — shows, movies, commercials, you name it. But Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai was too messy to be emotional for me, and in that sense, it failed at basically the main thing people will watch it for. <br />
Its more meaningful contributions on how it approaches life and death fell short, so how much you will enjoy it is basically entirely on how prone to crying at romantic dramas you are.<br />
If you choose to watch it, you&#039;ll have a better time if you don&#039;t take it too seriously and are already a fan of romantic dramas. Otherwise, I suggest you look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Art: 5<br />
Sound: 6<br />
Characters: 3<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
Overall: 4.2

    This review vaguely goes over themes discussed at later points in the film. Read with caution.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been forward to watching this movie ever since the adaptation was announced. Despite not having read the source material, the premise, while cliché, sounded less like a story that was larger-than-life and more like a passing, everyday one. And on a whole, the film started strong in that aspect but began to deflate upon itself when it took a down-to-earth story and made it more than it needed or was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The story is about a girl named Sakura who lives with the secret that she has a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296048">
        fatal pancreatic disease that would substantially decrease her lifespan, and an antisocial, emotionally detached boy finding out about this secret by chance when he finds her diary labeled &quot;living with dying&quot; (as translated in english). Sakura gains an unusual interest in this boy after he learns of this, and they begin to grow closer despite their clashing, antithetical personalities. The genius of this premise, in my opinion, is the very fact that the protagonist remains unnamed and is without a past or personality; this alludes to the fact that it could very well have been anyone to find out about Sakura&#039;s secret, and that regardless of who found her diary, she would&#039;ve grown close to them and needed them in her life despite how much they wouldn&#039;t get along with her simply due to that. She finds it liberating; she can be real and open with them and not have to make excuses to avoid distancing herself from someone she cares about.<br />
<br />
However, this film failed the moment when it tried to become larger than itself, larger than what it had initially intended to be. It falls into the sensationalized, romantic trap of star-crossed love and the allure of destiny and inevitability when the story wasn&#039;t actually about that at all. The story was about the peculiar normalcy of finding out a classmate is dying in the midst of a world where relationships and social perceptions seem superficial to those excluded from them, not that the meeting of a gratuitous stranger and the subsequent change in oneself as a result can be attributed to the predetermined. The story failed when it made the protagonist – a character initially unimportant to the story other than to serve as the narrator – more important than he needed to be, when all he really was was someone for Sakura to lean upon in her time of need because of the simple fact that he knew something about her that nobody else did. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s my main gripe with this film: the narrative should&#039;ve stayed truer to itself and its themes. The rest of it, in my opinion, works very well; the art direction, animation, and soundtrack is great. The film has many unexpectedly shocking moments, and an incredibly upsetting irony that underlines its core narrative. It&#039;s an emotionally powerful experience that certainly isn&#039;t lacking when it comes to gut-punches. However, for me, it lost something when it tried to reach for something that it very clearly wasn&#039;t for the sake of pointlessly obtaining an even higher level of emotional impact. To me, this film didn&#039;t need that, because the very beauty of it is the simplicity, the normality, the modest and somewhat absurd approach to death and how in the end, it really doesn&#039;t matter who you are, where you come from, or even what your name is as long as you can be what someone else needs the most.

    I decided to watch this Movie in the split second that nearly made me miss the last bus that would make me arrive at the cinema on time. <br />
<br />
From the Title you know what you are getting yourself into. even at the start of the film it starts just like Grave of the Fireflies. after it takes you back to where it began and you embark on an amazing journey that makes you Sad and happy with how Sakura handles her illness. As time goes by you immediately feel uneasy and sorry, until the credits roll and longer as a the end credit scene plays

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292210">
        (yes just like Marvel there is one).<br />
<br />
The Characters are all charming even with only a few you get to know with it focusing on the Main character (His name is disclosed till the end of film so i wont say it) and Sakura. The Voice actors did a remarkable job on this film and suit the characters perfectly. It&#039;s hard to write a review about this film without spoilers as everything i want to write is considered a spoiler here.<br />
<br />
The Art Design is just like &quot;A Silent Voice&quot; with scenes that are so pretty with Cherry blossoms, fireworks, and even the normal city streets are beautiful. makes you wonder why the real world isn&#039;t like that. The facial expressions on the characters immediately capture what kind of person that character is and as time goes by how their personality has changed.<br />
<br />
Sound Design is just like any over Slice of Life anime, its pleasant and peaceful, and gives the scene a perfect atmosphere on what they are trying to go for. The Opening theme to the Film is very good and wouldn&#039;t mind listening to it from time to time... But i don&#039;t think i could handle it with the type of film this is.<br />
<br />
Overall i enjoyed this Film, it brought tears to my eyes and i was engrossed all the why through. If you haven&#039;t seen it yet, see it now. i say its better or just as good as &quot;A Slient Voice&quot; or &quot;Your Name&quot; and is definitely worth your time.<br />
<br />
Before i end this review, ill like to say to the People who only watch Dubs, i also mainly watch Dubs as well. I found at sometimes it was moving a bit quick, but still held up, the Voices are very well done and you should see it instead of waiting for a Dub that will never come. So please See this Film while you can.

    I&#039;ve gotta say just one thing to start off with, watch this. sit down, don&#039;t get distracted, don&#039;t stop/pause it in the middle for a bathroom/popcorn/snack/smartphone break... pick some time where you WON&#039;T be interrupted what so ever. this movie is excellent. I&#039;ve no clue what the novel or it&#039;s manga is like; but as a stand alone movie this one SERIOUSLY ties my #1 choices up in knots. &#039;Kimi no Na wa.&#039; WAS my singular #1 anime movie ever. but now I think I&#039;ve got two. <br />
<br />
I guess the biggest &#039;YES&#039; for this movie is: Haruki is me. for over 40 years now I&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296287">
        lived a life much like he&#039;s lived his not even 20 years. I mean we&#039;re not a 1:1 perfect ratio. I&#039;ve had a few true friends and some seriously false or shallow ones. but in my mind I&#039;ve always been alone. also, I use my imagination mostly to satisfy what sociologists claim is one of the biggest things humans need; socialization with other humans. but Haruki&#039;s SERIOUSLY got the emotionless part of being detached and stoic (the philosophy AND the demeanor) down to a T. much more than I do. so, I found myself almost slipping into his character like a pair of gloves that I&#039;ve owned for years. <br />
<br />
everything else about this movie, Sakura, Kyouko, the guy with the gum, the &#039;perfect&#039; guy/class rep, the art, music, story, it&#039;s all excellent.     <br />
<br />
oh, and if you hate/love unreliable narrators  this movie may tick you off a whole hell of a lot. on the other hand if you love em, it&#039;ll make your day.

    What will you do if you know that you are going to die in one year? Of course, most people definitely want to live their life to the fullest, fulfilling anything they want, going to places that is impossible to go, or maybe devoting themselves to a spiritual journey in the name of God. This anime film definitely will reminded you of death that eventually come to us whether you like it or not, how you should leave your mark in this world and how it could change other person to a better one. Having the most misleading title I have ever heard, I Want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296912">
        To Eat Your Pancreas definitely became an inspiring anime for you to be a better person for somebody else and of course, yourself.<br />
<br />
Just like any other anime that set on high school, the story begins with an encounter between a boy and a girl. The boy found a book that belongs to the girl who actually has a pancreas disease and will die in one year. No one knows about this fact except for her family and now, him. The girl took an interest to the boy because he did not pity her for her condition and from then, their journey to fulfill what the girl wants begin. It may sounded simple at first but the boy was not a sociable person, a complete opposite of the girl, Sakura, who was very bright, sociable, and cheerful. This is why Sakura is an important person for the boy&#039;s character development from the beginning of the movie to the very end of the movie. Sakura helped the boy to be more open by showing him good things those came out from a friendly relationship. And not just that, Sakura became an integral part for anyone else who knew her as her good friend as she was able to shape them into accepting each other. From there, let&#039;s continue to an aspect that I love about this movie.<br />
<br />
The level of this anime&#039;s details. Yes, I noticed that this anime puts a great heart into making the details brighter and thus, made the main story better. One example of details I love is the gum guy who is the boy&#039;s and Sakura&#039;s classmate. This gum guy really love to offer the boy a gum and persistently doing so over the course of the movie. Simple, right? But the gum guy really affect how the audience judge the boy&#039;s character development by that simple move. Many times the gum guy trying to offer his gum to the boy and rejected over and over again, and for the boy to accept the gum guy offer, it showed how much the boy grown after he met and spent his time with Sakura. Eventually the gum itself signed a bloomed relationship between two people whether it is from the gum guy or others later. Not just gum, there are many details those have not mentioned here and worth to note as those are all part of how the story and plot flow.<br />
<br />
Then, let&#039;s discuss the animation. Well, the animation itself is something expected from a feature length budget anime but there&#039;s one thing that is worth to note and that is background illustrations. The backgrounds in this movie is visually stunning as those were beautifully drawn. I just love the colors of the cherry blossoms as it resonated with Sakura&#039;s name. It made me fluttery inside like some kind of teenage girl who just spent her time with a boy she like and I think that was what Sakura&#039;s thinking while smiling in front of those blooming cherry blossoms. It successfully brought out the mood that the scene wanted to convey visually and for that, it is a huge kudos for the guys who worked on that department.<br />
<br />
I will not say much about the soundtrack as for me, it is not remarkable but it managed to set the mood right for the scenes. Hmmm... Maybe, I would say that the opening song of this movie performed by sumika is worth to check and listen, so try to listen to them!<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime has became a great ride for me as it has been a long time since the last time I shed my tears over watching an anime movie. It served as a perfect reminder to leave a good mark for people around you as they may changed for you or because of you. Either for better or for worst. In the end, it is your decision for how you will continue to live and what marks you will carve to this world.

    Terrible.<br />
<br />
The main guy was awfully underdeveloped at the beginning, which made him completely unrelatable and boring . As the story progresses, he got a bit more developement and became quite a decent guy. But he is largely a very mediocre character.<br />
<br />
The secondary characters - the &quot;best friend&quot; and &quot;ex-boyfriend&quot; - were dumb and annoying. Calling them a bitch or a dick would not be a harsh treatment. At the end of the movie, I had to ask myself if those two had any brain at all.<br />
<br />
The plot is a recycled melodrama telling the story of a dying girl meeting a guy with the most useless

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297690">
        plot twist ever. I was both cringed and mind-blown by its stupidity.<br />
<br />
The animation and the music was good. Nothing worth noting though.<br />
<br />
The only okay thing about this anime is the main girl. She is a likeable character who was sweet, kind, and cheerful. By no means is she an amazing character, but the movie did a good job portraying her character through her relationship with the main guy and the diary. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, I would generously score this movie 5/10. It was very disappointing.

    &quot;Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai&quot; was a movie that was able to emphasize the main protagonists to be unique dynamic characters that underwent change throughout the whole movie. The movie&#039;s plot was unique and was not generic at all. &quot;Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai&quot; advised viewers about what it means to be &quot;living&quot; through focusing on Sakura&#039;s unaltering fate of death. The anime&#039;s art and sound were able to perfectly intertwine to create an enjoyable experience for viewers. Ultimately, I perfectly enjoyed the roller coaster of feels that &quot;Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai&quot; gave me. The movie highlighted the unchangeable fate that all living individuals

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296572">
        face which is death. [small spoiler alert] The main character Sakura is faced with chronic kidney disease and even though she is secretly terrified of death, she puts out a brave front and continues to live her everyday life &quot;normally.&quot;

    Do you feel like no one likes you? Do you try and cover it up by saying things like &quot;I dont care what others think&quot; and other classics like &quot;Everyone is fake but me&quot; while still secretly hoping for a gf to stumble onto your lap?<br />
<br />
Well do I have the anime for you!<br />
<br />
Join our blatant self insert character filled with wonderful personality quirks such as not talking and staring blankly with no expression as he discovers love by the only way a person like so would, with an incredbly pushy person throwing yourself at you. <br />
<br />
Marvel at his denseness as the love interest practically begs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337136">
        for him to make a move already and carries their whole friendship on her shoulders because he is just that special.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve seen any kind of pixie dream girl story thats basically it, she lives for the expressed purpose of bettering the main character by making him see life is meant to be enjoyed instead of brooding 24/7 in the distance.<br />
<br />
The premise is such: girl will die soon because of pancrea failure and wants to enjoy her last days with someone emotionally stunted enough to not react by this fact.  And boy does she find that.<br />
<br />
Pacing is fine, and the ending is nice enough (ignoring the scene after credits, damn they really had the gall to do that huh) with the guy learning somethings along the way.<br />
<br />
Art is not something to write home about, better than average tv series but nowhere near the quality some anime films deliver. The designs are very normal but I get they were trying to go for realism.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a movie so it will always be quick to watch, so theres that, you&#039;re not wasting your time with this. It isn&#039;t memorable but hey, it&#039;s a pandering movie so if you want some of that, no judgment and enjoy it!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    I recently watched this and toward the end, I felt strongly about how *bad* it got near the end and had to write my thoughts down about it. But before I begin...<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s just get this out of the way. While I understand the meaning of &quot;I want to eat your pancreas&quot;, why would someone ever title a story over this? Did you have NO other creative title to suit the needs of this story? How about Living with Dying, the title of the journal the main girl wrote? Was it copyrighted, and you couldn&#039;t think of something better? Was that too literal, and was too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297027">
        boring for a title of a story? Anyway, let&#039;s talk about the actual story.<br />
<br />
A young girl has a terminal illness and we&#039;re going to see how she plans to live her remaining life knowing this. Sakura is a decent character, all things considered. She is thoughtful, she is playful, and her medical condition made her grow as a person. This is all good... if only she was the main protagonist.<br />
<br />
Naaah. Our main male protagonist instead is the boy. Apathetic, asocial, aloof, Haruki most likely is there just for the purpose of the writer to shower him with character development. And that&#039;s the problem. He doesn&#039;t feel like a real person to me. He feels more like a blank page ready to be filled by any extreme event that might occur to him. It&#039;s just way too predictable. Ton of stories feature character development in more subtle ways. You don&#039;t NEED a random stranger with a terminal illness to change your initially flawed way of thinking. You don&#039;t NEED this random stranger to be overtly assertive that forces you to do things you don&#039;t normally do.<br />
<br />
Hell, why is he even this way to begin with? Could this story be more about Japanese culture as a whole? Are most Japanese boys like him? Haruki&#039;s background wasn&#039;t really explained enough, maybe because of the constraint of a 2 hour film. We never got to see his family or his past. His mom seemed okay as a person. Does he have a dad? Haruki just feels a bit TOO apathetic and asocial. I guess he&#039;s relatable? People are typically afraid of rejection and failure, so we often end up not doing anything just to feel safe. A lot of stories end up like this one given the blank slate of its main character: An indifferent person has to deal with something out of the ordinary and changes their ways for the better. But tons of stories have some kind of creative take on this story.<br />
<br />
This story offers nothing new and most of the conclusions are fairly straight-forward because of the failure to create a real meaningful protagonist. If Sakura was the main character, you get an entirely different take on the story. Maybe before she dies, she&#039;s interested in helping out an indifferent person for whatever reason. Maybe her father was very indifferent and lived a more difficult life because of it. Something, give me something that makes character motivation and characters feel real.<br />
<br />
Now that&#039;s kind of the main problem I have about the story. I wasn&#039;t really going to write an entire review on this until I got to the end of this film. All things considered, it was an average and predictable film. Then the end happened. And not in a good way, nooo. But more of a, -why the hell did you do this to Sakura when she already has a terminal illness- kind of way. This was some of the most non-sensical event I’ve seen about a girl that already have a terminal illness. <br />
<br />
Rather than have her eventually passing away and Haruki coming to terms with her death, the writer decide to prematurely end the story in another way. I’m not going to spoil it for anyone reading this, but it just feels so, goddamn, random. The only plausible explanation would be something about “life is unfair”. But Sakura already HAVE a terminal illness, that isn’t enough for you? Shouldn’t the main theme that is already established to be about a boy becoming a better person? Oh, no? It wasn’t? Riiiight. You guys forgot. This isn’t just about character development. This is about you saying my story was too predictable. Here’s a curveball for y’all!<br />
<br />
I have no idea what went through their head, but the ending was a disaster. Coming to grips with death, that was fine. Haruki is becoming a more developed person. Sure, even if it’s predictable. But the story now has to end, and I don’t really know how to write a realistic scene of a girl passing away in front of a boy, soooo, here’s something terrible for you because everyone love a good feeltrip right? That’s exactly how we’re going to break 8+ on MAL!<br />
<br />
The ending only enhanced more mediocrity of this already predictable work. At the end of the day, ‘I want to eat your pancreas’ is a generic melodrama that aim to create an emotional reaction out of you. Anyone who is remotely empathetic can feel the sadness Haruki will go through. Anyone can relate to Haruki for being unable to meaningfully connect with other people. Anyone can respect Sakura for having those pockets of wisdom about life and death. But that is it. You probably have seen these characters and story in just about any anime that was remotely dramatic. Nothing stood out for me in a positive way, and the ending just made it all stand out in a really bad way. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I enjoy a good emotional drama. But the ending? It felt rushed, unnecessary, and seems purely to get an emotional reaction out of you. No, I&#039;m not even talking about Haruki&#039;s reaction to all this, I&#039;m talking about what exactly happened to Sakura.<br />
<br />
And this wraps up my thoughts about the movie. I watched it with my girlfriend on a weekend evening. Neither of us particularly enjoyed it, and we’re astounded the ratings here are this overwhelmingly positive despite many negative reviews being top voted. Perhaps this is some people’s first emotional journey about a terminally ill young girl. Perhaps feeling emotional is all that is needed for a good rating. <br />
<br />
Whatever your case might be, I think you and I both want to see more creative works that targets some of the emotional stuff we have to face eventually. But in this way? I’d rather not.

    Ahhhh, i regret that i find this anime just now,i should watch it when it first came out !!! Love the story sooooo much !!! I love the characters a lot. The way how the story goes are so good and the fact that i cried watching it definitely shows how beautiful this anime is. At fisrt, I did not expect much from it but then after finish watching it my heart felt something like woww i really want to live my life the way I want and I dont want to have any regret left. The story teach me that even doing something simple

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296701">
        can be something special in my life, it does not have to be traveling around the world to satisfy the way i live, it can just be go out with friends eating my favourite food, go karaoke, study to gether or maybe just be with each other and talk about something silly, because every little thing can have a big meaning to it. This story make me want to do a silly bucket list for me to fulfill and I cant wait to do that. This story is a must watch and i am sure you wont refgret watching it.

    If I were to describe this movie in one phrase it would be normie pandering. The movie does nothing new to the genre, just your typical tearjerker that did nothing right. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
The movie is full of contrivances, an example being the way the two met, the main guy just randomly finds the girl&#039;s diary and since he&#039;s a bookworm, instead of returning the diary to the lost and found, he reads it.  The movie starts off with the girl&#039;s funeral, when I first saw that, my immediate thoughts were alright let&#039;s see some character building with the main dude and the girl, she&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305659">
        probably going to die around the middle of the show, then the rest would be the aftermath of him dealing with his emotions, her friends, &amp; her parents, SPOILER FROM HERE ON OUT, that didn&#039;t happen. Instead the show puts the two characters into quirky, wack, weird XD teenager situations that do not happen in real life, leaving me scratching my head intensely waiting for her to just die. The movie teased us multiple times with her being in the hospital but didn&#039;t go through with the just let her &quot;die unexpectedly early&quot; plot, instead making her dying from a stabbing attack, I was already pretty zoned out at the time so I can&#039;t really remember if the crazy ex-bf guy stabbed her or just a random dude. Although I didn&#039;t really mind the &quot;plot twist&quot; that much, it&#039;s just a generic shock factor, the aftermath could be completely unchanged whether she died from the stabbing or just the diseases itself. There was zero point of that twist, even though it was foreshadowed multiple times on the TV news in the cheesiest way possible. The story is mainly about the characters so the rest would be in the character section.<br />
<br />
Art: I&#039;d say the art was fine, some fine animations, the scene with the little prince had some janky cgi but overall I don&#039;t have too much to complain about.<br />
<br />
Sound: Generic sad piano music, voice acting was fine until the main dude&#039;s breakdown which sounded comical to me (at least the subs) <br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
Main character guy starts off really obnoxious, he was just a dickhead towards the main girl at the very start until a little after the middle of the movie at which he just becomes a nice guy. He seemed like a self-insert character, barely any personality, kind of autistic. His favorite line in the first half was &quot;What kind of joke is this?&quot; said in a very dickhead way. He said that he has never had a friend his entire life prior to meeting the girl, why did it have to be so extreme, his mom seems like a pretty normal person. The main message of this movie (if it even has one) seems to be to connect with others in society, but the main guy was living just fine without having a single friend his entire life, which I doubt is possible in real life considering most of those people most likely will just kill themselves. He seemed to me as having barely any sex drive, but then gets embarrassed at times you think he would just brush it off with a straight face. The characters come out as not real in this movie, they barely speak their minds to each other, and when they do it&#039;s through a corny truth or dare game or just side characters verbally or sometimes physically attacking the main character. The girl is very selfish, which is fine since she&#039;s going to die, but you would think with her being selfish and constantly manipulating the main guy&#039;s emotions, she would at least address it in her will, which she does not, instead she goes on and on about some uninteresting talk about their names and stuff? The scene in her bedroom where she was actively trying to titillate the main guy was funny to me, the guy gets horny because she keeps doing these sexy things to him, and she starts going apeshit about it, what did she expect? Right after that happened, the girl&#039;s supposed ex pulls up, being stalkerish and crazy, punches our main guy, then our girl comes out and tells her ex she hates him and the guy just kinda dips. The whole exchange felt forced and out of place, it felt like it was there just as a plot device to make the couple make up. The main girl&#039;s best friend was just a straight up bitch, she came off to me not as a person that cares for the main girl a lot, but just annoying. There&#039;s this one guy that just offers the main guy gum, he would always decline the offer and as you would expected, the last time he was offered gum from gumdude, being the &quot;Changed&quot; man that he is, he accepts the gum. The guy felt like he was just kind of there for no reason. To sum up, the characters are uninteresting, annoying/obnoxious, and barely have any chemistry between each other. The girl said that she would cry behind the main guy&#039;s back and don&#039;t want to tell her friends about her illness because she doesn&#039;t want them to change the way they treat her, but the things these two have done could&#039;ve been done with her friends had she informed them about her illness, I&#039;m sure her best friend would do all those things with her with no questions asked.<br />

Conclusion: One thing I&#039;m going to say is that if I were to show this movie any normie for example my mom, they would probably love this movie, they would think that the setting of the story to be very sad to begin with instead of thinking why it even happened. The story would not have existed if the guy didn&#039;t hang out with her knowing that she will die and he might get emotionally affected, especially considering that he was being such a dick towards her at the start. If you&#039;ve never seen this kind of forced tearjerking media, then you probably would&#039;ve loved the fireworks scene, you would think the corny music playing in the background and the fireworks is kino. There will be a lot of people that will enjoy this movie and think it&#039;s the greatest movie ever because they cried a little bit, but it just came off to me as unbearable and cringe. The dialogues are corny and wouldn&#039;t be things real people would be say. If you manage to read through this rambling of a guy that&#039;s bored out of his mind, you&#039;ve might noticed that not once have I used any of the main characters&#039; names. I mean one reason is I cannot remember them, the other is that they did this talk on the train about the main guy&#039;s name and they made it seem all-important and secretive by not telling the audience his name, then later to be shown that it&#039;s just a corny way of showing that the two main characters are a fated couple of some sort. Apparently this movie was screened around here, and I am damn glad I didn&#039;t spend my gacha money watching this shit kek. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this movie to anyone.
