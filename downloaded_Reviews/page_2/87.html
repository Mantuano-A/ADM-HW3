    Bakuman 3 picks up at where the previous season ended. The quality didn&#039;t drop at all, it&#039;s as awesome as the 2nd Season and better than the 3rd. I&#039;ve watched 5 episodes and given the circumstances of this anime (3rd Season) I&#039;m sure that I can give it a worthy review.<br />
<br />
Story (10)<br />
The story is still great with the usual pacing style of the previous seasons. There&#039;s just something very addicting in the pacing of the story, it feels like no second is wasted at every episode. Each one brings something new to the story, good news and more hurdles at the end of the episode.

        The cliffhangers really get you excited to watch the next episode too. The plot twists are still the same as ever, they seem pretty petty and weak for an anime but they&#039;re realistic and you can really relate to them because they fit the slice-of-life genre very well.<br />
<br />
Art (10)<br />
Art is still the same, it&#039;s different but it&#039;s neither bad nor good. It doesn&#039;t stand out and that&#039;s actually what makes it fit for it&#039;s genre. Bakuman isn&#039;t about flashy art, dramatic music and all that glitter. It&#039;s good as it is. Though the quality drops at times, it doesn&#039;t really affect the viewing enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Sound (8)<br />
The sound is like the art, it&#039;s the same.. not bad and not good. The OP is decent and the singer&#039;s voice is kinda weird but it doesn&#039;t really bother me. The EP is good, nothing to say about that. No objections about the sound really.<br />
<br />
Character (10)<br />
Characterization is the same and still good. Same goes for character development, in fac there&#039;s actually a little bit of character development as soon as the first episode. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10)<br />
Bakuman is still addicting as ever, that&#039;s all I need to say.<br />
<br />
Overall (10)<br />
Overall, the quality didn&#039;t drop one bit. It&#039;s basically an extended Season 2, which was already perfect in my point of view. It&#039;s as interesting as ever and I don&#039;t think it needs any improvements at all. Any plans to change some things up &#039;for the better&#039; would&#039;ve backfired on them.  Bakuman 2 and 3 is one of the best Animes I&#039;ve seen.<br />

    Dreams are hard to follow and even harder to make them come true. Whether it&#039;s getting securing your ideal job, marrying someone you always admired, or becoming a superstar, dreams require many ingredients to make it come true. It requires hard work, determination, motivation, creativity, and even a little luck. Yet, when people follows these dreams, it can be surprising on how much they realize about their goal and about themselves. In Bakuman 3, the series follows two best friends who hopes to achieve their dreams and become professional manga artists.<br />
<br />
Ahh, Bakuman once again returns as the third installation of this trilogy, known as Bakuman

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92125">
        3. It&#039;s amazing how this show can still keep it together after several years. The series is written and illustrated by Tsugami Ohba, who is known for his famous work Death Note. In contrast though, the series does not give off psychological impressions but rather follows a slice-of-life style of presenting its story. The series has achieved universal success with its manga predecessor and likewise, I find that the third and final installation manage to keep it together once again.<br />
<br />
The series follows two best friends, Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi. Collectively known by their pen name, Muto Ashirogi, the duo hopes to make a name for themselves by getting serialized in the Weekly Shonen Jump. With a little hard work, motivation, determination, and luck, they might just be able to do just that.<br />
<br />
Like its previous predecessors, Bakuman 3 presents itself as a slice-of-life style series. Dreams are hard to make into a reality but we can clearly see that Muto Ashirogi hopes to do so. It follows their youth lives in a natural way as opposed to normal teens. Most teens often think about their future and dream jobs later on in life but at only 9th grade, the duo Muto Ashirogi has already began to climb that ladder to success. It&#039;s not easy though as becoming a manga artist is a very stressful way of life. In fact, Moritaka already knows this with the unfortunate circumstances of one of his family relatives. It even strived him away from thinking about the dream in the beginning. Furthermore, there is competition. Becoming a manga artist is a lot harder said than done. In fact, it can be compared to climbing the world&#039;s tallest mountain, winning an Olympics gold medal, or achieving a world record in the Guiness Book. Okay, I&#039;m probably exaggerating a bit here but you get the idea. It is not easy.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Bakuman 3 incorporates many ideas from the art of manga creation itself. It presents to viewers how manga is made with the ideas, how to get the material published, and how the industry works directly with many of its episodes. It looks hard and definitely requires a lot of effort. Yet at the same time, watching this series makes the career seem fun and exciting. In fact, it&#039;s that much exciting when Muto Ashirogi gets recognized for their work at various circumstances. In a way, Bakuman adapts its series of manga-in-manga but in a way that makes it look like a lifestyle.<br />
<br />
The slice-of-life continues to exist just like its previous predecessors. It follows the duo in their every day live mixed in with comedy, drama, and romance. The drama part comes from Nakai who continues to linger his ways of going after Aoki despite their previous encounters. It doesn&#039;t stop there though as a love triangle ensures between him, Aoki, and Hiramaru. It&#039;s two guys and one girl in a triple threat. As silly as it sounds, the love triangle plays more of a progressing role for Aoki as she makes her stand and point known.<br />
<br />
With the dramatic romance part aside, the technical part of Bakuman 3 also comes into play with some controversial events. In fact, Ashirogi Muto gets some unprecedented media attention after some unfortunate events. The duo wanted to make a name for themselves but not in the way that they see it this time. It gets a bit complex and even causes stress to the duo for their dreams. Forget dreams, it&#039;s more like a nightmare now after such an event. It should be no surprising though as the author of the series wants to visualize what manga artists needs to deal with in the real life. It&#039;s realistic in many senses from this case as becoming a manga artist is never easy. There are challenges every day whether it&#039;s competition, scandals, overworking to meet due times, and bringing out ideas to audiences in its finest form. The imaginations that manga artists comes often requires extensive thoughts and planning as well. I personally found that the ideas used by Ashirogi Muto is a bit repetitive and even borrowed from themes used by the real artist/illustrator of Bakuman. In other words, although the series&#039; manga ideas are fun to read, they often lack a bit of uniqueness or set themselves differently from others. It&#039;s often hard to present ideas when so many others exists beforehand but overall, I only considered the ideas that Ashirogi Muto came up to be....average.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I find Ashirogi Muto and their way of working to be quite interactive and fun. Often when working together, the duo seems to have more fun than expected with their ideas. It&#039;s not in a workaholic way in which the duo tries to be the very best or earn cash but rather to do what they enjoy in while hoping to achieve success. Even when the duo are arguing, the dialogue is presented in an entertaining way. The words spoken by the characters are colorful and often or not, becomes an inspriation for their ideas. These ideas are transformed into their product for the world to see. Of course, success isn&#039;t easy to come by especially with competition. Major supporting characters as Eiji are obstacles for Ashirogi Muto and they must overcome him to achieve that success.<br />
<br />
On the more dramatic side, Bakuman 3 also introduces what some fans may see as a real antagonist in the form of Toru Nanamine. He represents the antithesis of Ashirogi Muto. On the surface, he looks like a fun and outgoing guy with a chill personality. However, deep down he is seen as a hot-tempered, manipulative, and an individual who is willing to do absolutely anything to achieve success. The construction of his character makes him an antagonist by the way he compete against Ashirogi Muto because he even relies on underhanded tactics to ensure his assumed victories. To him, making manga is about winning and being the best in contrast of Ashirogi Muto who wishes to achieve their dreams.<br />
<br />
Bakuman 3 does seem to continuously adapt a slow pace. Furthermore, the many dialogues used between the characters often gets dull, lacks flavor, and dragged. The seemingly antagonist Nanamine is also easy to predict by viewers as the villain by the way of his actions. It&#039;s not hard to see him as a two-faced individual who wishes to become the best even relying on iniquitous tactics. These tactics of course doesn&#039;t always go the way he wants to.<br />
<br />
The artwork of the series remains intact compared to its previous seasons. J.C. Staff adapts the anime based off of the manga and does a fit job in making its artwork intact. And of course, because this is an anime series based on making manga, the artwork created by the various artists themselves also are presented artistically well. The artwork in fact is edgy but gives off that realistic look at the series from the outside. In the inside, the manga and characters&#039; designs gives off a natural sort of look. It looks realistic and doesn&#039;t look too flashy, not that it needs to be anyways. There is no fan service and fans shouldn&#039;t be surprised at this considering it&#039;s NHK network known for airing lighthearted series.<br />
<br />
For the soundtrack department, everything seems to remain the same. Both the OP/ED song for the first and second half depicts on a montage of the main characters. Some of the soundtrack does to be repetitive but still retains its natural vibrations. It balances it out with the general lighthearted outlook of the series.<br />
<br />
Overall, Bakuman 3 is a pleasant series for me and I think for fans, especially those who&#039;ve watched the previous predecessors. Even if you don&#039;t like the idea of making manga, the series makes it interactive with its extensive dialogues, competitions, and characters&#039; interactions. And of course, some of the manga ideas themselves can be entertaining. It&#039;s not easy making dreams come true but Ashirogi Muto sure has great hopes. They&#039;re climbing that ladder of success and opening doors to imaginations.

    Bakuman is, undoubtly, one of my favourite mangas ever. Saying that, why do I rate it so low? Because this season was such a rushed and low quality adaptation that cannot stand a chance against the original version or even against the previous seasons. While the first and second animes adapt an average of 2.5 chapters of the manga with great detail, this one even gets rid of characters, important situations and even a whole arc. Let&#039;s not be naive: animated language is different from that of written or drawn media, so one can understand that adjustments are always needed. Maybe some brilliant moments in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90061">
        manga can&#039;t simply shine in an anime. That&#039;s a given and it should always be comprehensible. My complaint isn&#039;t about a panel or two that weren&#039;t copy-pasted to the animation. If you haven’t read the manga, I can’t blame you if you think that this is a quite good anime, but after watching seasons 1 and 2, it&#039;s clear that the pace and development are quite different.  <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s give some clear examples. Nakai is meant to be a tragic and despicable character, which is great because it makes his realistic in this shounen world full of generic and plain characters: he gives his dream up just because he wasn&#039;t loved by Aoki. A frustrated man, Nakai reappears until Nanamine&#039;s arc, now as an obese and gross person, always harassing women. After Nanamine&#039;s utter defeat, Nakai finds himself lost once again, so his only option is to sell portraits in the streets of Tokio. He then is mocked  and humiliated by a group of shallow and bitchy girls, becomes violent against hostess in a club and then, drunk and devastated, runs to Aoki&#039;s house just to beat her. In this anime, however, half of Nakai&#039;s personal drama was just cut off. He was turned just into a ridiculous character without depth. The same can be said about Shiratori Shun and its forgettable and brief appearance, or Shizuka, the non existent hikikomori addicted to hostess club mangaka.<br />
<br />
One of the greatest moments in the manga is Azuki&#039;s arc because it&#039;s a great critic of the idols market. Those girls are they are bound to be incarnation of young men&#039;s fantasies, pure, untouched, flawless and unreal women. As soon as one of them shows a bit of humanity (that includes, of course, having feelings for a man), she is condemned and bashed. Shortly after otakus find out that Azuki has a boyfriend she becomes target of criticism and hate. While talking with her fans, someone asks her if she&#039;s still virgin (which, in the anime, was censored) and they call her a slut. While many people have criticized Ohba&#039;s female characters, he turns Azuki into the one who has to fulfill Ashirogi&#039;s dream, the one who has to overcome the last challenge by showing that idols are human, that they doesn&#039;t have to ask permission to love or to express what they really are as women. But this anime just turned all this into two or three mutilated episodes.<br />
<br />
And of course we have a last and necessary lecture: even if this anime was so mutilated it’s still over the average, which says a lot about how great Bakuman is.

    Bakuman 3 is a great continuation of the series. I enjoyed watching it and I can definitely say that it will be worth your time as well. Here&#039;s the review.<br />
<br />
Story is a 9.<br />
<br />
As with the previous season, it hasn&#039;t lost it&#039;s edge on story telling and pacing. It&#039;s easy to follow and easy to understand. My only issues are some arcs are a bit uninteresting and unfulfilling, like the Nanamine arc.<br />
<br />
Art is 10. <br />
<br />
Great art as always. Proper visual effects, no awkward animations or anything etc. Pleasing to watch, I should say.<br />
<br />
Sound is 9.<br />
<br />
Good soundtrack and proper voice acting. OP/ED were not really anything special

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143201">
        though, <br />
would prefer Bakuman. 2&#039;s OP.<br />
<br />
Character is 10.<br />
<br />
The character development was great and I really like how they interact witth each other. Eiji is definitely the standout as I appreciate how his eccentric behavior hasn&#039;t changed at all. Kazuya Hiramaru also improved also, not only in the comedic sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is 10.<br />
<br />
Every episode makes me either laugh or feel emotional. The scenes will always put a smile in your face because they are just so great. <br />
<br />
Overall is 10.<br />
<br />
It deserves the title of masterpiece because it isn&#039;t just enjoyable but also it has been considered a piece of art. This is an anime you can watch over and over and still end up not being bored.<br />
<br />

    Let&#039;s get things straight - this series is amazingly good. I want you to have that in mind as you read on since I would like to write about all 3 seasons and not just this one - I would like to sum up my experiences with the entire package. <br />
<br />
This whole adventure started when two men decided to share their dream (albeit for a different reason) and follow it through no matter what obstacles they face with their unwavering resolve. What followed was one of the best plot-driven stories I had the pleasure of enjoying.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
I should start by pointing out that for me there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171649">
        are two things about the story that must succeed in order for the plot to be interesting. Number one - the story itself has to be interesting. Number two - the way it&#039;s presented must be interesting - this includes pacing.<br />
And Bakuman does both in a superb manner. We have two men trying to create the best manga that ever existed - personally I was allways kind of interested in the process of manga creation and I admit even though I don&#039;t know how the market really works - the way it was presented here made me want to try and make a story myself (that is despite the fact that my drawings would horrify people...) - it&#039;s not easy and your goal isn&#039;t just laid in front of you - but it pays of if you mange to actually do it.<br />
Now I believe the reason why pacing is so great is because it&#039;s so uneven. At times we will spend and entire episode with our characters thinking over one issue but then there are also episodes with 3 timeskips a few weeks each. This helps us focus on what&#039;s important at the moment.<br />
Sometimes the focus is on micro - when they discuss what to change in a chapter of their work. Sometimes the focus is on macro - when we have multiple timeskips that show how their changes influence the popularity over a larger span of time. With this we can look at the story from two different perspectives and it&#039;s not boring.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I don&#039;t think many people would argue but the art was really really good. Maybe not Makoto Shinkai good but still - right below that. Also please note that if it was made in a Makoto-like style I would probably rate it lower since the art is very fitting for the characters (I had a slight problem with the gag/parody animation but only a minor one) and it trully is a pleasure to the eyes.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
It rarely happens but I actually enjoyed every single one of the openings and endings and the music in the series itself was were it was supposed to be. It wasn&#039;t something that would grip my heart but then again - this isn&#039;t a story about musicians. For the most part I&#039;d say it did the job it was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Oh yes - this is the main reason I loved it so much. Characters for me are absolutely the best part of the series - it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s perfect of course.<br />
<br />
So let us begin with our double protagonists - Takagi and Mashiro.<br />
They are the driving point of the entire story obviously but for me what steals the show is the chemistry between them. You can really see how they try their best and how they support each other over the span of all three seasons.<br />
There were moments where I thought &quot;what he&#039;s doing is stupid&quot; but then I reflected - maybe I wouldn&#039;t do it but Mashiro would - it&#039;s very fitting for his character.<br />
If I were to choose my favourite however I&#039;d pick Takagi - I loved his resolve. In every single season he did things that made me think &quot;he&#039;s awesome&quot;. The only problem I had with him is I believe he should really pay more attention to his wife.<br />
<br />
As for female protagonists - Kaya and Miho.<br />
Miho was the weakest of all the characters in my opinion - I found the concept she thought of &quot;not seeing each other&quot; as being silly but I must admit it really was a sweet thing. Not to mention I can&#039;t even imagine how I would feel if I was working for something so hard for so many years - I believe that feeling would probably be worth all that wait. Probably. Yeah... probably. She had a weird feeling for me nonetheless but she grew on me and while I had a problem with her in the first and second season - I was totally fine with her in the third.<br />
<br />
As for Kaya - I think she&#039;s my favourite character here. Partly because she&#039;s so invisible in the third season. It&#039;s allmost like the story wouldn&#039;t even change at all if you take her out of it. But it only makes her greater in my eyes since I couldn&#039;t wait when she shows up. Her emotions towards our male protagonists, her cheerful cheering (pardon me for that) and the dedication she puts into helping them makes every scene with her in it a real feast. I think the real strength of her character is also what we don&#039;t see - as her support for our mangaga duo is only seen on the surface as it would seem.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t write about every single character since it would take too long so I&#039;ll just try to summarize it real quick. <br />
Most of the characters introduced were very enjoyable to watch and they all had their unique... &quot;quirks&quot;. Nizuma seemed completely insane, Aoi and Fukuda focuse on her work, Hiramaru is incredibly lazy - and it goes on. What we get is a pretty wild mix of characters with different views on obtaining the same goal.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
It goes without saying that I enjoyed this series tremendously but I can&#039;t convey all of that in just a few simple words. Even though there were moments I found less interesting - I still couldn&#039;t stop watching and I launched one episode after another. This is the pinacle example of the syndrom I call &quot;I just started an episode and it&#039;s already end credits&quot; where you get so completely absorbed by the story that you lose the sense of time. <br />
I would like to trully recomment the entire series for everyone - you shall not be dissapointed!

    I love, Bakuman! I picked this series up on a whim one morning at a book store. Was looking for something fresh, and fresh I got indeed. Now, you might not think Bakuman, a story that resolves around 2 kids who wan&#039;t to make it big in the manga world is exciting, but, the Author of this series adds so many cool characters, twist, and special events that it&#039;s not hard to fall in love with the series. <br />
<br />
Now on to the anime adaption, I loved the first 2 adaptions of this series. They did it very well, with out cutting stuff out to help

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77535">
        there show. Now, when Bakuman season 3 came out, I was excited to see the stuff that&#039;s been going on in the Manga (I pick them up monthly with the speed up Viz is doing). So far the show is doing good, but out of nowhere there starting to cut out ALLLLLLOOOOT of crap from the manga. Now I know some of the stuff isn&#039;t useful but to go from the START of Bakuman Volume 13 to almost the END of Volume 13 in just one episode? No, that was not cool at all. <br />
<br />
Besides that the anime adaption is doing good with the music just hope they start slowing down the pacing when it comes to volume 14-16

    *This review Covers the Third Season of Bakuman and Spoilers are included<br />
The Final Season of Bakuman finishes the Story with finally fulfilling the Dreams of Mashiro Moritaka and Takagi Akito. Though in my opinion I found Season 2 much appealing but that doesn’t mean this season was bad at all.<br />
<br />
Story: 7.5/10<br />
The Story in this Season wasn’t bad but not much appealing. The first half of the series came with story arcs that started off strongly but ended in a generic way. But the Second half was much better as the Rivalry between Ashirogi Muto (Mashiro and Takagi) and Niizuma Eiji was shown perfectly. And the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373192">
        Azuki Miho Arc at the end was good as well. So, the Story was kind of straight forward in Season 3 but good in its own way.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: 7/10<br />
Nothing’s changed oh nothing’s changed. And I don’t know what will even change in this one. At the very least I can say that the Art of the Artists was improving. The animation was the same as it was in the previous season, good.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.5/10<br />
The soundtrack of the series was again same for the most of the part. The Openings and Endings were not as good as Season 1 &amp; 2 but still were good in their own way. This time we got two openings in one season and I liked the Second Opening more than the first one in this Season.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
I have said this many times that Bakuman has great characters. And this is the part where they are on their maximum development. This Season showed how they started and how far they have reached now, and no matter how far they have come they still have to keep moving. Especially the Part where Niizuma Eiji declared for ending his Manga was shown nicely.  Though I think there was no need of bringing new characters in the series even if they gave them nice development as the new characters didn’t have that big of an impact. Still the characters were great as always.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
The Final Season was enjoyable to the very end. This Season focused on Mashiro’s and Azuki’s dream to finally getting fulfilled and their journey to creating a great Manga comes to an end. Especially the second half was a lot enjoyable compared to the first half where just normal arcs were going on.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
This Season was again an 8/10. So Overall the whole Anime combined was an 8/10. Bakuman did a nice job for inspiring other towards their goal and that’s the reason it is so great. This review was not as long as my other reviews on this series were because I don’t want to keep repeating why this Anime is good and I just talked about how I felt for this season.<br />

    What a great anime ! I think  it was the best season of all 3 , the quality of the art was a little better , the drama and the romance was more intense than the other 2 seasons , but what I really enjoyed in this one was the work of &quot; Ashirogi Moto &quot; and the great challenges between theme and Niizuma , it was both exciting and enjoyable to watch . I definitely think the serie of bakuman was one of best series I&#039;ve watched so far , simply because of the unique story and the nice touch of comedy that

    *If you havent watched the first and second season, please, watch it first.*<br />
*contains minor spoiler*<br />
<br />
&quot;Once upon a time there was an anime called Bakuman, At that time, many anime that doesnt give any positive values or any good things. and thats when Bakuman rises and give a hope about how anime must giving encouragement to our generation for working hard and achieve our dreams&quot;<br />
<br />
Bakuman 3, is the third season of Bakuman or the last season of Bakuman. Bakuman as we know is some of catch-your-dream anime that have inspiring many people, including myself on how we must to pursue our dream. As we know, in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88913">
        this year there was two catch-your-dream anime that have been released, beside Bakuman there was Space Brother. The two high quailty anime that have so many positive values that we can get from both anime.<br />
<br />
STORY (10/10)<br />
Anyway Bakuman 3, continue the story from when PCP got a first place in the first chapter. Like the previous season, Bakuman still interesting to watch, but in this season, Bakuman is more less problem. We can call this season is the time for Ashirogi Mutou for &quot;picking the fruit&quot; that they have made . If we have saw the struggle in the previous season then in this time they&#039;re focussing on how to get anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
There isnt any much different with the pacing style in this season, Bakuman 3 still keep the slow paced, with this pace they make every episode is totally worth it, there isnt any episode that wasted or not important. Importantly, they have a good management on how to attract the viewers, there is, make the CLIFFHANGER ending in every episodes. Well played bakuman, well played.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART (6/10)<br />
If we comparing this season with the previous season in art section, you will find nothing. from 2010 until 2013, there isn&#039;t any improvement or any much difference with the art quality. J.C Staff still keep with some poor drawn. But of course art is not their prominent section that makes bakuman is interesting. Yes, the art is dull and looks old. But now i am sure, anime without a good graphic still can be amazing especially when the story is amazing, they cover the shortfall of the art.<br />
<br />
SOUND (8/10)<br />
Again, there isn&#039;t any much different with the sound section if we&#039;re comparing from season 1 or season 2. But not like from the art, the sound section is still awesome, from the seiyuu itself or from the OP or the ED. In the OP we have two opening until now (episode 22), its Nano.ripe with &quot;Moshimo no Hanashi&quot; song and Hyadain with &quot;23:40&quot;. Both song was really awesome, since i am a fan of Nano.ripe i love the first opening, its sweet and really raise the mood. and for the second OP, it was decent. <br />
<br />
For seiyuu&#039;s voice i dont have any problem with this, since the seiyuu for the main lead (Mashiro and Takagi) was really an expert, they both (Abe Atshuhi and Hino Satoshi) have many experience as the main lead in another anime. and more the sound quality isn&#039;t drop. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER (10/10)<br />
What makes bakuman is interesting beside the story? the CHARACTER of course!. In this season, you will see a LOT of development between each character even the LOVE development for some characters. Furthermore, the characterization was still the same from the previous season. So, not much to say.<br />

OVERALL and ENJOYMENTS (9/10)<br />
Bakuman is one of few anime that can make me sit quietly and enjoy the series for the whole days. I am not exaggerate, it was true. I have recommend this anime on several people (who isnt really addicted to anime) on my college and they said they were really enjoy this series and they said they can watch this anime for a whole days. and its same for me too, this anime was amazing and i would recommend this series to anyone.<br />

    This review will pertain to the entire series.<br />
<br />
Story: 16/20. This story should be so obvious. Why have I never seen this be done in anime? It is easily digestible and at points addicting to watch even if I can&#039;t bear scenes. The only issue I ever had with this is that it never evolves and it seemingly drags in areas because of it. Other than that this story is a gem that had me addicted. Season 3 although was a weak point for me. Ninamine is a terrible villain that seems like they tried to pull off like a death note-esque rivalry except half-assed and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408479">
        somehow worse than what death note was. And the romance part of the story is another thing i dislike but i will give that its own portion. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10. Good but dated. Not much more to say. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10. It&#039;s melancholic at times and over-dramatic but still enjoyable. Didn&#039;t care about any of the Ops or ed&#039;s tho.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2/20. The relationship between the characters and this story is parasitical. Such a compelling story that&#039;s supposed to be inspirational is ruined by preachy and one-dimensional characters. With so many characters they all boil down to one sentence, &quot;I won&#039;t lose.&quot; The only characters i like are hiramaru, miho and kaya. To me they&#039;re not so much characters but more so an embodiment of something. To me, hiramaru is a stubborn guy who rushes into things without knowing what is ahead. Something i deeply relate to. Miho is a personification of a dream in my opinion. That&#039;s all her purpose really is. The dream to be successful. And kaya is a normal person living in a world of talented &quot;geniuses&quot;. But other than that most boil down to &quot;I won&#039;t lose to &#039;insert name&#039;.&quot; Why is it that a show has 20+ active characters yet all of them boil down to the same shonen trope. To me, this show failed because it was too shonen-like. Too fixated on being appealing to the masses and ended up coming out preachy and corny. On a final note they completely assassinate Nakai&#039;s character in the second season. He is a good guy. he is just a gooey romantic. Him acting in such a grotesque way is not how he was ever written and it honestly is just a ploy to create drama and to establish him as a &quot;super editor&quot; (terribly done).<br />
<br />
Romance: 1/20. What. Was. This. Romance. &quot;I love you but I&#039;m gonna avoid you at all costs till I become successful even if it takes like a whole decade.&quot; It&#039;s awkward when they do interact and borderline unwatchable. They seemingly never mature. They&#039;re 24 living out their life like they&#039;re still 13. Kaya and Takagi are okay I guess. There&#039;s nothing to them aside from the MC getting a cute waifu... Hiramaru saved the characters and the romance from being complete flops. When he&#039;s trying to get with Aoki it&#039;s all obsessive and funny (the best humor in the whole show) and completely not him. She and he are technically opposites. He is clumsy and doesn&#039;t think while Aoki is cautious and aware of how to be. But I kind of see Aoki as someone who brings out what Hiramaru should be and in that, I think they&#039;re perfect. Nakai and Aoki were good until they destroyed their character by making it that Nakai didn&#039;t like Aoki he just liked any girl. That ruins the magic and is the start of his character assassination in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10. I guess I would consider this a dumpster fire. This show is like Death Note to me. Something I can acknowledge as trash but never look away from. No matter how many times the show made me mad and had me cringing I wanted to know what happened next. I wanted it to be what I thought it could be. But now that it is over what&#039;s to long for. I love the story for its originality but at the same time, another author could&#039;ve made this more compelling and more fulfilling. I got enjoyment but I&#039;m left with one of my biggest what-ifs in all of anime/manga history. What if they could&#039;ve fleshed out characters and made the storys romance more tasteful and vibrant with emotions. I still think the premise and their rise to the top is tasteful because it&#039;s still a big journey, even if it&#039;s with dull characters and bland romance (aside from Aoki and Hiramaru). <br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10. I didn&#039;t like it. Would I recommend it? If you can bear the romance and the bland characters repeating lines every few minutes I&#039;d say yes you should watch this show. For what it&#039;s worth you won&#039;t ever really see something like this, and for that I commend it. I can definitely see the appeal of this duo&#039;s works but to me, it&#039;s missing the character progression, and script.  <br />
<br />

    Bakuman was originally a manga which got turned into an anime which is about the main characters trying to get it big in the manga industry in order to get an anime to fulfill their dreams.<br />
<br />
If you were to read what I just stated above, You wouldn&#039;t really feel any interest in wanting to watch it. I mean how can an anime with a combined episode count of over 70 be able to be that good? Well you&#039;re wrong. This anime manages to turn such a corny plot into something beautiful.<br />
<br />
I write this review with the assumption that the reader has gone through the whole

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182307">
        series, meaning all 3 seasons.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I was quite skeptical to start watching it because it really seemed like it wouldn&#039;t really go far with what it seemed like it had to offer. But I&#039;m glad I was proven wrong.<br />
<br />
The series is a bit unorthodox when compared to the majority of the entertainment that manga and anime have to offer. What I liked about the story is that even though it felt like it was revolving around the protagonists,  they didn&#039;t give them all the glory that most protagonist get. the series comes with not just ups but also a lot of downs for the main characters. They really depict how the industry works and how hard it is to climb your way up it. For someone who has read a lot of manga and watched a lot of anime this story will really get to you. It allows you to appreciate anime and manga even more.<br />
<br />
Even though the story was obviously predictable(Like of course they will make it big, of course he&#039;ll get the girl, of course they&#039;ll be number 1) it was really more of &quot; It&#039;s about the journey not the destination &quot;. And it really does have a really good lesson at the end.<br />
<br />
I recommend it to an audience that has a bit more experience watching various anime and manga before watching it, because you&#039;ll really be able to feel the appreciation this anime will give you.<br />

    NB : I know writing a review before completing an anime is not something to do, but consider this review worth for the two first seasons of bakuman.<br />
<br />
One of my greatest reproach to bakuman was the treatment of Nakai-san character : in the the 2nd season he displays one of the coolest epic &quot;i love you i don&#039;t care if you don&#039;t&quot; scene with the winter writing in front of Aoi-san place. Then he&#039;s oust the series with an explanation that does&#039;nt suit his character.<br />
But in this third season the authors actually succeed in making his eviction a plausible character development.<br />
<br />
So just for this one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189132">
        fact, hooray for Bakuman season 3. :)

    I find this series very entertaining and always find myself fired up when everyone gets in that mode of the whole my rivals are pushing me to do my best in the manga world. <br />
<br />
Nizuma Eji I have to say would be my most favorite out of the manga authors there because well he&#039;s a genius at most. Ashirogi is also my favorite in the series. I&#039;ve watched all three seasons and don&#039;t want to see this series end.  <br />
<br />
I recommend people watch it.

    Bakuman watch first season episode 1 and i SURE you will addicted to continue watching and read the manga as well. <br />
<br />
The mastermind behind this anime was none other than  the famous Death Note creator. The story it self is a masterpiece ,IMPACT,PASSION,DEVOTION,TEARS . A truly story of Life ! <br />
<br />
The story itself is original and fresh,a story about how 2 protagonist make their way to archived their dream to become popular cartoonist(Mangaka) the concept was so simple yet the story telling was good.This story only the one who in touch deeply with manga  can write out not by other! <br />
In addition ,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90713">
        this anime not  centered only to manga but the life of teenage also included such as relationship ,study and obstacle in life.<br />
<br />
The art was cool , you will notice the line art of the character was so detail , how they present the story is unable to describe through writing . See it your self and compare to other work you will see the art is top notch in this anime.<br />
<br />
I would recommend you to read the manga after you finish the anime because the anime skip a lot of story if you really love this show . Somehow i got a feeling that this anime indirectly told the life of the creator .<br />
<br />
In a nut shell this anime was not simply for everyone,but anyone whose NEVER watch or have a negative review  for this show i think you did not DESERVE  to call your self an anime or manga lover!<br />
<br />
<br />

    This is not a review only of Bakuman 3 but of all seasons so far.<br />
<br />
Starting with the first episode: a very good one, it makes you laugh and showcase the world and the art very well. The thing is from the first episode you know how the anime is going to end(ish). I&#039;m not saying that this is a bad thing but this anime is slow paced, repetitive and even boring at some points so this plus having 90% of certainty of how things are going to end must cause most people to lose interest.<br />
<br />
The art and how things are shown bring a very strong

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203657">
        sense of reality to the anime also related to that it is awesome to see manga volumes that i have inside an anime. And the way they talk about real life animes with no censorship.<br />
<br />
The characters are very good explored in the way they think; you can know even what the most irrelevant character thinks about the situations presented. There&#039;s a bunch of characters which means many of them have a chance to be forgotten as the plot goes, but i think it&#039;s really wierd how Asuki just vanish for good long time. I understand there&#039;s script limitations but she IS a main character i&#039;d say.<br />
<br />
The message the anime gives us is beautiful and there&#039;s more then one. <br />
But so does most animes. I guess the slow paced way of showing this is part of what they want us to understand.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack isn&#039;t great and sometimes the &quot;sad music&quot; or the &quot;winning music&quot; enter too early and you can tell just what will happen next, if you haven&#039;t figured out on your own before (which isn&#039;t that hard). Even though i must say the music of the &quot;Super Hero Legends&quot; opening is still in my head.<br />
<br />
Also great that they worked on showing in a nice way the animes of the mangas created by those characters. <br />
<br />
A Good anime with deep characters and some serious feeling of reality.<br />
<br />
(First review ever i might have missed something. English is not my native language so sorry about some eventual mistake on the matter.)

    This is a *Spoiler* Free review. So you don&#039;t have pay me. Just kidding.<br />
<br />
*Crying* Good Night everyone. I am self proclaimed Idiot and I am going to give another review form an idiot&#039;s point of view. This time it Bakuman  the whole season, because I can&#039;t remember where Season 1 and 2 ended. Hahahahahaha!!!!! I watched all 75 episode back-to-back, but I went to sleep at night and probably missed class for 2 days. I probably got alot to make work, huh? Okay on to the review.<br />
<br />
Story (10): At first when I saw Bakuman, I thought, &quot;It romance and about being an mangaka, I&#039;m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200865">
        going to give a try because it&#039;s a romance.&quot; I am glad I decided to watch this anime. I like how when they would show the manga to their editor, they would give a voice and show it. I really want to watched all the mangas they made except &quot;Money and Intelligence&quot; it&#039;s seem to complicated for me to understand it.<br />
<br />
Art (10): I loved the animation, but not only that but the manga art they showed was to cool. I don&#039;t read mangas, because I hate reading but I like look at pictures of the mangas. I&#039;m an Idiot it goes without saying, right?<br />
<br />
Sound (10): I love the opening soundtracks in each season, especially Season 2. I don&#039;t really watch the ending because I was to pumped to watch the next episode. <br />
<br />
Characters (10): I don&#039;t like really like animes with to many characters because it always get to complicated for me, for example, Baccano!. They might didn&#039;t give the characters backstorys but I appreciate that in this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10): it&#039;s goes without saying. After every episode I want to watch the next one right away. I mostly enjoyed how Yoshida lied to and abused Hiramaru. I laughed so hard and started crying when Yoshida......  I almost spoiled my favorites parts. This is a spoiler free review.<br />
<br />
Overall (10): So what did we learn today kids. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. All you learned was my preferences. And reason you would want to know them is because you want to date me. Who wants to date The Self Proclaimed Idiot. I leave that to your I…ma…gin…ation. <br />
<br />
Next I will be watching Death Note. So be on the lookout for The Self Proclaimed Idiot...

    The third season of &#039;Bakuman.&#039; is somehow different from the previous ones. The art, the sound or the characters haven&#039;t changed anyhow. The main difference is in the story.<br />
What I liked the most about this anime was that it depicted the business of drawing manga from within. I mean there were many nuances like telling the wievers how the editoring deparment of Shounen Jump works. The process of working on new manga series, the work of the authors, their assistants, their editors, etc.<br />
That&#039;s what was the main theme of this series for me. I&#039;m sure that everybody who has ever read Weekly Shounen Jump manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86521">
        wondered: &quot;How do they actually do that? How much are the artist paid? How do you become a manga magazine associate?&quot;<br />
That&#039;s the point: All of that questions have already been answered in the two previous series. Now the author has just to put the plot to an end. And he does that with using mainly the theme of rivalry. Rivalry between manga artists has become a main subject of the anime.<br />
You may like it or not. I have to admit that hearing Mashiro and Takagi shouting &quot;We can do it! Let&#039;s work hard on it and beat everone!&quot; ten times per episode makes me tired of it. I wish they showed more of romantic themes and Ashirogi Mutou&#039;s mangas (they still show some scenes from their mangas, but it&#039;s too little).<br />
Anyway, if you watched the previous seasons then you have to watch the third season anyway. Just to see where the story eventually goes and if Mashiro will finally got married.<br />
And if you didn&#039;t - you should!

    Out of 100 Nobles watching…<br />
65 were impressed<br />
15 could just not care about the romance<br />
10 died of old age<br />
10 died in the hospital arc of a brain aneurism <br />
<br />
Bakuman was a really good show… for about one season. Seriously if I were to just talk about the first season of Bakuman I’d pretty much have nothing but praise for the show. The series has an interesting premise about two boys trying to become mangaka, and I was consistently surprised with the show’s avoidance of the obvious. In the first season you’d have your typical drama, conflict, and payoff, but Bakuman would always seem to subvert my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370864">
        expectations in a satisfactory manner. I don’t know what happened with the subsequent seasons and I have not read the original manga for reference, but by the time Bakuman was over I was glad I was done with it. <br />
<br />
I could critique the pointless melodrama and annoying subplots that diverted from the main story. I could complain that the series would only play one of three different background tracks at any given time. I could complain about how stupid the main characters “dream” is and how unhealthy it is or how no one in this story acts rationally… but I won’t complain about all that. <br />
<br />
The only thing that needs to be said about Bakuman to perfectly critique it is this, “Bakuman runs 11 episodes longer than Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.” About halfway through Bakuman season 2 this fact was constantly circling through my head. Bakuman runs significantly longer than FMA: Brotherhood and what does it accomplish with all that run time? After season one, not a lot I would say. The show doesn’t respect your time and after having wasted so much of my life just watching all the Haruhi Suzumiya seasons I have no patience for it anymore. <br />

    Bakuman is all about following your dream in life, how you should never give up and instead continue to strife to reach your goal no matter what. <br />
<br />
I have never worked as hard as during the time I watched Bakuman, it makes you really ambitious and makes you want to reach your dreams in life. Bakuman is truly a masterpiece, just like Death Note. Everyone, watch Bakuman and reach for your goals!
