    Promised what??? Attack on Who?? Re: Excuse Me?!? Boy here is the REAL most hyped anime of 2021. And what a way to start of 2021 with Yuru camp season 2 being back with the strongest 2nd swing I’ve every seen in an anime continuation. <br />
Story: 10 Oh baby did someone call for more camping with some nice character development. Getting to see just Rin’s backstory was extremely cute while being able to see Nadeshiko become her own experienced camper is so fulfilling. The texting dialogue is still as great as ever and I love how with it we see lots of interesting mixing going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376140">
        on with everybody due to their schedules getting in the way, all of it feeling nice and natural.<br />
Art and Sound: 10 I mean what more can I say the animators have made sure to keep it up with the mouth-watering food and gorgeously drawn vistas all making wish I could go on these camping trips too. The sound design while nothing to over spectacular more than gets the job done and the voice acting of all the characters more than still makes my heart flutter with joy.<br />
Characters: 10 What did you think this gets anything but a perfect?! They cast is all still wonderful and its fun seeing how the story actually has real time progression seeing characters working at their jobs to fund their camping addiction, Nadeshiko getting better at camping, and everything else that helps make this mundane story not feel at all repetitive and instead leaves you wanting more every episode.<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: Oh baby do I hear a perfect 10? This 2nd season is all I could ever ask for in a Yuru camp continuation, with fantastic art and music, fun character interactions, no strange tone changes with drama or anything of the sort, and the comedy on point. All of it comes together in a wonderful culmination to create a experience where the viewer wants nothing more to do than to enjoy the vibes these girls are experiencing with their relaxed camping ~(˘▾˘~).<br />
If you haven’t got on the Yuru Camp train yet then now’s the time baby, if you’re looking for one of the most enjoyable, relaxing and fun slice of life shows ever made then this is the show for you.<br />

    If there were such a thing as a Mt. Rushmore of anime, Yuru camp would be on it. This is really one of the greatest anime of all time and season 2 only reaffirms its ranking.<br />
<br />
What makes Yuru Camp great is not grandiose writing, world building or plot developments. Instead, its greatness lies in its simplicity. An anime that teaches you the ins and outs of camping, outdoor life and encourages you to go out and be active might not sound like the most exciting thing on paper, but in its near flawless execution it pulls you in and makes you fall in love.<br />
<br />
If you’re

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388771">
        here, you’ve probably seen the first season of Yuru Camp. Simply put, season two is better in every way. It’s everything we had in season, but there’s an emphasis on Nadeshiko and Rin’s character development that we see pay off in their solo camping trips. It’s a very satisfying and comfy journey with the girls as they learn more about their favourite activity, as well as themselves. Speaking of comfy, Yuru Camp’s biggest selling point is better than ever this time around. Every episode just sucks you in and makes you want to get under a blanket, grab some hot coco and snacks and learn. The amount of places, dishes and outdoor ideas that this show gives you is alone enough of a reason to watch it. When you throw in loveable characters and the humour, it becomes a masterclass in anime.<br />
<br />
The combination of adorable girls, comedy and legitimate outdoor safety education makes Yuru Camp a genuine treat for any anime fan of any age. The only complaint I have about the season is that it’s too damn short. Thursdays will not be the same without Yuru Camp. Yuru Camp season 2 gets 10 tombolos out of 10.

       This season of anime is really filled with so many show-stoppers, both in new entries and sequels. Just last month as I was scrolling through the upcoming anime, I was thrilled to be watching as many shows as I am now. Then, I literally jumped out of my chair and smiled like an idiot when I realized that Yuru Camp was getting a second season. Yes, I was that excited for a show about cute girls who like to go camping, but really it&#039;s more than that.<br />
<br />
   When I first started watching season 1 of Yuru Camp, I was just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376464">
        in my college dorm room eating lunch, and looking for a show to watch. It was a show that I got into just by the art style, but watching it gave me a sense of warmth, and calmed me down amidst a hectic college life.<br />
<br />
   Even right now as I&#039;m going through a particularly rough time in my life, I&#039;ve found Yuru Camp again to help get through it. Watching it is almost meditative for me in a way, in that it lets me slow down, and just relax. Truly this show is the type you&#039;d want to snuggle up in a warm blanket, maybe grab a light snack, and just enjoy some warm and wholesome fun.<br />
<br />
   If you&#039;re the type of person who enjoys slice of life anime, and is looking for an extra slice of wholesomeness in their life, I can&#039;t recommend this show enough. Watching this show just makes me happy, and maybe it will for you too :)<br />
<br />
*P.S. The ost is really good, and the ED is extremely relaxing* <br />
<br />

    &quot;I think solo camping is a way to appreciate loneliness.&quot; <br />
<br />
Great cute girl anime have an effervescent quality to them that never fails to casually curl either corner of my mouth no matter how inane or minimalist the antics on screen become. By now, we’re all familiar with quiddities/odds and ends of a cute girl anime as they’re thoroughly ingrained in the genetic code that makes anime...well…“anime”. What shows like “Yuru Camp” lack in narrative heft they make up for through sheer force of charm. And that’s not to say that shows pigeonholed as “CGDCT” are entirely bereft of anything worthwhile, as the narrative often

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388761">
        goes. I say this without a lick of irony, but cute girl anime almost form a sort of parasocial relationship with their audience, more-so than a lot of other genres. This is due to the grounded simplicity of the storytelling as well as the cast members themselves often serving as proper analogs for friends and family (save for the shrill voices and big eyes). <br />
<br />
But what more does Yuru Camp have to offer that hasn’t already been retrofitted by any number of other functional cute girl shows? Truth be told, you almost have to actively try to fuck up a cute girl anime because they’re just that easy to write. Most of them nowadays don’t even try to hide the fact that they’re aping one of their predecessors. In regards to content, Yuru Camp is quite breezy, so breezy in fact that some have taken to calling it (myself included) an iyashikei anime. On top of being an exemplary cute girl anime, Yuru Camp effortlessly bridges the gap between irreverent gag comedies like K-On! and meditative deliberately paced iyashikei like Aria and Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou. This is a particularly odd marriage of two genres on its surface, they’re practically diametrically opposed. But when you really think about these two contrasting energies, the shamanic self-reflective loneliness of an iyashikei and the galvanized free-wheeling entropy of being in a friend-group like a cute girl anime, therein lies the duality of a balanced life and the recipe for a damn great anime.   <br />
<br />
For transparency’s sake, I feel it’s necessary to be forthcoming about the fact that I am an avid camper myself. With that, you could potentially glean that I have a dog in this fight. Frankly, I do. Yuru Camp dials me back to those summer nights, splayed out on the pebbly shores of a campsite, drunkenly trying to point out the different constellations and asterisms above to my friends. Or simply lying there with our eyes closed as we share in a communal silence, melting into the night, knowing that when we open them again, we’ll be together once more. In the social distancing era, these moments are precious. <br />
<br />
Where S1 of Yuru Camp faltered was in its need to establish rudimentary camping know-how. Perhaps this is a non-criticism to those who don’t know much about camping, and in truth, the sight gags and sound editing greatly mitigate what would otherwise be something of a slog. This isn’t to say that the discrepancy in quality between both seasons is vast, not by a long shot, but with all of the minutiae having been already taken care of in its first season, S2 is significantly more focused. <br />
<br />
The degree of agency that these characters are given is frankly somewhat unprecedented for a show like this. By now you’d imagine that one of the core tenets of a cute girl anime is wholesome togetherness in the face of everything from abject misery to minor inconvenience, to the point that the term “moeblob” takes on an entirely new meaning. It’s a scary thought, imagine Tetsuo Shima’s transformation scene in Akira except with bigger eyes and multi-colored hair. The globular goofballs that populate Yuru Camp’s cast have far more freedom than that. <br />
<br />
What really sells Yuru Camp’s characters as an organic and believable friend group is the fact that they’re not always together. Their group texts read true to life, like one you may be a part of with a group of friends, making plans but also splintering off in different directions due to availability. While they all like each other in a manner expected of a cute girl show, it’s apparent that they have exclusive dynamics only present between certain friends. I’d also be remiss to not mention just how against the grain it is to force a wedge between these girls. This goes to show just how much trust is put into these characters as individuals going off on their own adventures and yet still being fully capable of carrying episodes on their lonesome. Often, these rare insular episodes are the ones that entrance you the most with their healing properties and measured pace.<br />
<br />
Individually, most of the characters remain largely unchanged but there isn’t really a need for them to change. Inuko’s little sister (Chibiko?) is introduced in this season, and she is just as saucy and diabolical as her sister, thank god they don’t have the nuclear codes. Nadeshiko, who was mostly relegated to an audience surrogate in S1, really came into her own this time around. Watching her navigate her first solo camping trip was delightful, mainly because Rin and her older sister fumbling to shadow her like concerned helicopter parents underscores just how much they care for her (on top of being hilarious). That aside, watching Nadeshiko put into practice what she’s learned from Rin (as well as passing some of her own wisdom down to other campers) is deeply satisfying. And of course, there’s Sensei. Ah Sensei, I’m right there with yah. <br />
<br />
I’ve watched quite a number of anime over the years but few that I’ve gone out of my way to watch have been so emphatic about exploring Japan’s natural beauty. You’d think that these girls were charting hinterlands in any given outing they go on. For example, I wasn’t even aware that there were notable basalt columns in Japan before having watched this anime (but I guess that’s on me). A show like this was made for the standard still-frame minimalism that animators in this industry are often forced to abuse due to scheduling and time crunches. The still-frames in Yuru Camp are almost like flipping through the pages of a glossy coffee table photography book. Would I be THIS charitable to just any show skirting by on the bare minimum as far as animation goes? It’s only because Yuru Camp knows how to properly calibrate its minimalism for maximum output. <br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is a comedy of details, and often the smallest of details do the heaviest of lifting. It’s the little things that make Yuru Camp so special, like when Ena is showing Rin photos of her trip with Chiaki and Inuko and you can see her finger partially obscuring the camera lens on her phone in the corner of the picture. A resoundingly innocuous detail but one that further adds to the organic believability of this world. I also can’t praise the character designs and outfits in this show enough. These girls have that Pacific Northwest DRIP. The character designs and general art design of the show is distinctively cartoony, save for the scenery porn. Yuru Camp does not come up short in the sight gag department. Its dry comedic sensibilities are accentuated by its snappy but simple editing style. Quick cuts and stylized facial expressions make up the bulk of the laughs but it’s not afraid to get creative with the musical cues and effects. <br />
<br />
One scene that really stood out to me as far as arresting camera techniques was when Nadeshiko was simply walking through a town during her first solo camping trip. As she walks with a mountain in the background and with the neighborhood she’s traversing in the foreground, the natural sense of parallax is almost like an old Disney cartoon on those multiplane cameras or even Akira (leave it to me to mention Akira more than once in a friggin Yuru Camp review). The interesting camera techniques also extend to the visual gags. Like when Rin attempts to cross a rickety bridge and it switches to handheld like she’s on Survivorman. <br />
<br />
Theoretically, Yuru Camp’s soundtrack is something that shouldn’t have a modicum of cohesion. The diversity of its sound palette was deliberately curated by Akiyuki Tateyama, who pulled from completely disparate corners of the globe. I can only describe the lush instrumentation as rustic which deeply accentuates the outdoorsy antics. You’ll hear anything from pedal steel guitars and fiddles to pan pipes and mandolins in any given episode which can honestly catch you off guard. The delicate acoustic guitar notes and the mellow lounge percussion remind me of Choro Club’s work on the Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou’s soundtrack. There’s even a bossa nova track or two which makes me yearn for Hekiru Shiina on backing vocals at the very least. <br />
<br />
For better or for worse, Yuru Camp’s tactile qualities will make it something of an insurmountable wall for certain audiences. It’s not a particularly challenging anime but it’s the type of thing that you kind of just have to “feel” for yourself. I’m sure some will find it to simply be nothing more than a twee travel brochure anime padded to its core with innumerable layers of fluff and the occasional yuck. But for others (who are fortunate enough to have the means and capacity to do so) Yuru Camp is a prescient anime whose content is a charming forecast of better days to come in the great outdoors. I’m privileged to live in an area with a rich cultural heritage/a melange of biomes and microcosms to see firsthand. Nonetheless, even if it’s as simple as a leisurely trek/drive down a street you’ve never been down before somewhere in your hometown, I urge everyone to soak in something new with or without the company of others, it makes no difference. There’s not enough time allotted to us to let it all slip away like a fleeting dream. <br />
<br />
Yuru Camp was crafted from the purview of someone who has a deep affection and understanding for what they write about. What may be a quaint show to some, to others will be a didactic reminder of our transitory human condition, and the onus is on us to make the most of that fact.

    I shed tears out of nothing in the middle of the second episode.. <br />
<br />
Before you assume this anime from it&#039;s name; cute girls do cute things and that&#039;s all. <br />
It&#039;s significantly more than that. I like to call this type of genre &quot;Fuwa-Fuwa&quot; which is for everyone because it&#039;s an easy watch, from you can just sit back and enjoy. However, Yuru Camp is superior to any other light hearthed shows. <br />
<br />
The reason why I started crying is because of the slice of life part. Which perfectly represent real life events. It&#039;s also teaches you how to appreciate the little things in life. From you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377259">
        can realise how beautiful life actually is. It&#039;s just pleasant in any way. The cast from they daily routine, how are they working hard for they leisure activities, (dreams/life goals). The sound and animation is also charming, beautiful and relaxing. <br />
<br />
Which is certain in Yuru Camp;<br />
<br />
🏕️ Beautiful people &amp; Lovely main cast. <br />
🏕️ Delicious dishes ideas and it&#039;s cute noises.<br />
🏕️ Beautiful camping spots and nature. <br />
🏕️ Camping techniques and advices.<br />
<br />
If there would be a score for beyond Masterpiece, than I would give this, with an easy heart. 10+1 for Yuru Camp. Just an outstanding anime.

    Winter is the perfect time for camping. Would you agree?<br />
In the winter season 2018 we all enjoyed the camping tour of our girls for the first time, three years later the long-awaited continuation is finally here and the comfiness continues!<br />
<br />
We all already know what &quot;Yuru Camp△&quot; (don&#039;t forget the little tent) is about: Camping! The story is just as simple and ingenious as we know it from the previous season. But wait, we experience Nadeshiko camping alone for the first time without her friends. Can that go well? Camping items are also quite expensive, so she has to take a part-time job to be able

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388768">
        to afford all the trips. Of course, we get to see many new beautiful locations, the view is simply wonderful. Just having fun together and experiencing new adventures is the most important thing.<br />
<br />
Our girls are just like we know and love. Nadeshiko, understandably, still loves food more than anything, while Rin is worried and takes care about her. A friendship for life. &quot;Chibi-Aoi&quot; or also called Akari is going on tour with the group as well. We experience the brilliant pranks of the sibling duo Inuyama even more. The co-president of &quot;The Outdoor Activities Club&quot; Chiaki can of course not be missing and Ena even bought a dog tent for her little Chikuwa. A heroine who thinks of the animal first instead of herself. The best teacher Minami is ready to drive our girls and accompany them on their camping. She sticks to the rule &quot;Don&#039;t drink and drive&quot;, but her love for alcohol remains inseparable. Nade-chan&#039;s older sister Sakura showed us that she also likes to go on excursions and onsens are definitely a good choice for her (at least for us viewers). With Ayano Toki we get to know a new character. Aya-chan is Nadeshiko&#039;s childhood friend who has known her since middle school. The family members of the Kagamiharas and Shimas should not be missing of course. We know where Rin&#039;s love for her scooter and camping comes from. In short, everyone is back!<br />
<br />
The landscape is also beautiful this time. You would love to go there yourself and see it. Whether sunset or sunrise, we experience all the beautiful moments from their camping. The food in particular looks so delicious. Regardless of whether it&#039;s just a simple cup noodle or hotpot with lots of ingredients, you get hungry by looking at it.<br />
The music is as happy and relaxing as before. Perfectly suitable for this anime.<br />
<br />
Had a hard day? Just want switch off and relax? Yuru Camp△ is the perfect anime therefor. The combination of the beautiful view, the simple tranquility and our loving characters makes Yuru Camp△ to THE anime we love. Get something nice to drink and eat and make yourself comfortable. In the end, comfy is everything!<br />
<br />
Carpe diem - Seize the day and watch Yuru Camp△!

    &quot;The things you see, the things you eat, and the time you get to spend contemplating things. I think solo camping is a way to appreciate loneliness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is the gargantuan paragon of iyashikei. Imagine working all day in a hectic semester; it&#039;s hella cold outside, you&#039;re in your blanket at the end of the day with a cup of hot coffee, and you&#039;re watching some cute high school girls going out to camp in the countryside japan with a matching atmosphere. The time you spend alone, watching this cozy little show - not with your friends but with yourself alone can make you feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388805">
        happy to be alive. <br />
<br />
Yuru Camp&#039;s plot is nothing grandiose, nor does it swathe itself with arcane philosophical themes - but that&#039;s the charm of the show. Set in the Japanese countryside, Yuru Camp is an experience where you immerse yourself in the jejune and tranquil lives of moe high school girls that love camping with calming music and alluring backgrounds to enhance your experience. The cozy, calming, laid-back world of the main characters that heavily contrasts with our heavy continuous lives - it&#039;s that brief 25 minutes of the week where you refuse to care about anything about your life.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s main strength comes from the characters - particularly from their wholesome yet humorous interactions. Character interactions ranging from emotionally touching and human to goofy and comical - never fails to leave me at cloud nine at the end of every episode is highly commendable. We got characters with an ample mix of personalities - from the lovable goofball that is Nadeshiko to the quiet and reserved Rin. Everyone - even the side characters contribute to the experience that is Yuru Camp. Just watching them as a group doing cute and wholesome things alone has the power to ostracize any cynical voice inside my head. Nonetheless, even with a likable cast, the show won&#039;t be the same without their interactions as a group. The character likability has been augmented with the ever-strong character acting this season, brilliantly portraying character growth - especially for Rin, who is now opening up to more people. While this is nothing groundbreaking, noticing such character growth is a fulfilling experience.  <br />
<br />
Being a part of the prolific genre of &quot;Cute girls doing cute things&quot; - the show itself feels different from a generic CGDCT anime, especially the spotlight is definitely not the moeness of the characters - but rather the hobby, that is camping and camping accessories. However, concealed behind the mask (camping), Yuru Camp does feel like a traveling encouragement show - like how Haikyuu was potent enough to encourage volleyball as a sport. Every splendor of the countryside Japan is annotated to us - be it popular tourist locations or the local food specialty. I think I&#039;m not the only one who checks out every mentioned location on the map. Like, who does not want to check out real-world counterparts to locations mentioned in an anime you love - especially when the said spots are immaculate scenic campsites!<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is blessed with immense love from the staff - that it&#039;s evident that there&#039;s a clear passion for the project that you feel oozing through every frame. The show has an immense level of attention to detail - be it the enticing food imagery from okonomiyaki and yakisoba to Shimarin Ice cream(lol) or the camping accessories - all thanks to the talented props and mechanical staff. Minor elements like beginning and ending the episode with Nadeshiko moving away from her only friend to Nadeshiko with her new friends, or the competent and self-sufficient feeling when Nadeshiko was finally able to buy herself a lamp, but also a gift to her older sister - which was depicted generously with a brief night timelapse from Ending theme makes Yuru Camp such a great show.<br />
<br />
The show takes a softened photorealistic approach towards the background art - that perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere as this non-idealized art direction perfectly executes a realistic feeling. Music has a tremendous power of healing - that directly helps your heart and mind feel elated. Fortunately, Yuru Camp has been blessed with Serene and Calming music to enhance the experience. In introspection, Yuru Camp takes inspiration from a Danish Concept Hygge - where being comfortable is emphasized for the well-being. As they say, &quot;What freedom is to Americans..hygge is to the Danes&quot; - might be why the music in Yuru Camp resonates with Nordic and Irish tones, which ultimately enhances the show&#039;s warm atmosphere. The already good production values from the first season have been improved by a lot.  The pacing is perfect, and the marvelous storyboarding - meshed with remarkable direction and cinematography that helps the viewer immersed in the world.<br />
<br />
Immersing into Yuru Camp feels like that moment of childhood that now exists as a picturebook - as if you&#039;re reliving that memorable moment lost in time. Even though the show is very grounded and comparing with real-life might feel superfluous - watching the show does feel like reminiscing the good memories of your childhood. Devoid of any dramatical elements, everything in the show is wholesome - be it the immaculate character interactions or Nadeshiko&#039;s Glutonny or the humor or even noises from the non-living items guiding us. <br />
<br />
All Thanks to Afro-sensei, Yoshiaki Kyougaku, and the passionate staff at C-Station, we got to experience maximum healing from what 2020 was. Yuru Camp is truly a gem to this medium.<br />

    Yuru Camp is the type of anime that makes you appreciate the little things in life. There are few circumstances in which a girl simply buying a lamp could move me to tears but it&#039;s the hard work and dedication that she put in, that makes it possible. The scenery is movie quality, the main characters are equal parts funny, wholesome, likeable, whimsical and at times downright goofy. But for me the soundtrack ties it all together in a nice neat bow. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack consists of acoustic guitars, ukuleles, fiddles and other instruments that set the perfect backdrop for an outdoor adventure. The backgrounds have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376306">
        jaw dropping amounts of detail, to the point where I had to pause periodically through the anime just to get a double take. The characters are well written with a variety of personalities that both compliment each other and at times, act as foils for one another. <br />
<br />
These characters aren&#039;t just limited to one troupe either. For example the main character Rin projects a calm, cool demeanor at a glance, but through her internal monologues we (the viewer) come to realise she&#039;s very enthusiastic, energetic, and expressive much like her counterpart Nadeshiko. The only difference is a willingness to show it overtly. You see a lot of this in characters like Kaguya Shinomia.      <br />
<br />
Overall this anime is comfortable, it&#039;s familiar, like a family member. Highly recommended. 10/10

     Yuru Camp is a grossly overrated anime that barely kept my attention all the way to the end. Truly, I was in a grueling death march near the end of the show.<br />
<br />
Yuru camp season 2 plays it safe, and overall, is just a step down Non Non Biyori. While nature shots are adequate in Yuru Camp, they&#039;re sporadic and are usually still shots that aren&#039;t the greatest. Non non biyori features them both in greater frequency and quality. Plus, Yuru Camp is largely a show centered around camping and nature, yet, again, the feeling that you&#039;re being immersed in nature while not being overpowering

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391451">
        is done so much better in Non Non Biyori. Hell, let&#039;s not talk about other series, season 2 isn&#039;t even better than season 1 since it barely builds off  or branches off anything from season 1. <br />
<br />
What makes Yuru Camp a middling show is definitely how it plays it safe and repetitively. Again, season 2 mainly features similar scenarios to season 1 without much change. The formula is always some people in the outdoors club going camping, and going to do some leisure activities unique to that area. This formula actually doesn&#039;t sound bad, but Yuru Camp executes it on such a surface level. Hot Springs, cafes, specialty foods, famous landmarks, Yuru Camp dabbles in these areas but never truly dives into depth into any particular activity. Describing the action of camping might have been the only thing that there was a huge focus on. You mainly have the characters doing these random activities in quick succession, as well as eating, but you&#039;re not satisfied. The scenic shots are pretty decent, but can&#039;t carry the entire show. The landmarks and activities just have the characters quickly visiting them without much meaningful dialogue or events happening, and the cooking process is briefly mentioned despite being food emphasized quite a bit in the entire series. <br />
It&#039;s always the &quot;activity&quot; being emphasized over the characters, and that&#039;s my biggest problem with the series. Which characters do you really get to know. For a story that&#039;s largely about the many interactions of the characters when camping, you sure as hell barely get to know them in any particular depth. This mainly has to do with the many &quot;nothing&quot; conversations that happen. I&#039;m totally happy to watch the characters have mundane conversations, but the conversations these characters have always have to do with the particular activity that they&#039;re doing and never really have to do with their own personalities, hobbies, problems, etc. There&#039;s only so much you can do when camping, especially when it gets darker after dinner, and even when doing other activities like hiking and visiting landmarks, there&#039;s always time for random conversations, and that&#039;s certainly one beauty of camping. Yet, this show does not capture this aspect very well. I never get to really see any silly  conversations or slice of life conversation like I do in Non Non Biyori, for example, but rather it&#039;s always about &quot;look at this food I&#039;m eating,&quot; &quot;wow this mountain looks great,&quot; or &quot;it&#039;s cold!!!&quot; <br />
Overall, I wished for there to be more fun character interactions that aren&#039;t always focused on the environment around them, and just some more in depth focus on the particular activities they&#039;re doing. Again, close up shots of the cooking progress, some fun events or dialogue that happen when they&#039;re at a particular location, this stuff never happens.<br />
Overall, you&#039;re stuck with barely developed characters sticking to their pet lines and interactions for the entire series, with nothing else to carry it, whether it be the scenic shots, locations, dialogue, and activities.

    They say that good things come to those who wait. And after the sheer excellence that the first season of Yuru Camp delivered, fans were chomping at the bits to have more. And now after 3 years of waiting, the long awaited sequel season has come at what I believe is the perfect time. With the world being in utter chaos, we needed something that slows things down and shows the beauty of the world in which we inhabit.<br />
<br />
Season 2 kicks off directly after the end of season 1, with the girls just ending their Holiday vacation and enjoying the New Year’s sights. As the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388780">
        season progresses, Yuru Camp tackles topics such as earning money for new equipment and how vitally important it is to be informed and prepared; but it also gives development to its characters making this more than just “cute girls doing cute things”.<br />
<br />
While the story itself is still nothing majorly significant, watching this overwhelming charming cast of characters do anything continues to be an utter joy to watch. And that’s what Yuru Camp is, a character driven show. All the girls have terrific chemistry with their own quirks and personalities. Their charm is undeniable making Yuru Camp the soul soothing and relaxing watch that it is.<br />
<br />
As I stated earlier, the girls do get some development learning new things about how to camp on your own, the importance of being prepared when camping with knowledge of the camp site, weather, local rules, and so on. This helps the show from feeling stagnant or stale, watching the girls learn and grow gives a feeling of progression.<br />
<br />
Visually, Yuru Camp stays consistent with the first season. Because it takes place in the real world and the locations they visit are real places, the artists actually trace photos taken from these places to ensure that they are as accurate as possible. I also think that’s important too, as being accurate to real world locations can help travel and tourism to these wonderful places. From mountain vistas, lake landscapes, scenic cities and towns, to ocean views, Yuru Camp is a varied visual treat showing off the natural splendor of the Land of the Rising Sun. I would be remiss if I forget to mention the delectable food that’s made as well. Local delicacies from the places the group travels to, camp hot pots, and even cup noodles all look delicious and savory.<br />
<br />
The characters are as cute as ever with rounded and soft looking designs that helps emphasize the comfiness that this show exudes in spades. But this season feels as though they incorporated just a few more visual cartoony gags, which is OK in my book, it enhances the already stellar comedy. The color palette is bright and colorful making the show look so lively.<br />
<br />
Animation wise, Yuru Camp has its moments, but ultimately doesn’t have too much to write home about. There are no high movement scenes, but the animation does its job, especially during comedic scenes using chibi or exaggerated art styles to hit home the jokes, which are again terrific. Honestly the best shots are usually the still frame ones that feature the broad landscapes mentioned previously.<br />
<br />
I don’t think I can overstate the excellence in Yuru Camp’s soundtrack. Jaunty tunes, peaceful melodies, silly songs, and hauntingly tranquil pieces fill the show that only enhances the viewers’ enjoyment. Using instruments such as violins, marimbas, acoustic guitars, wind instruments, and even just straight up whistling gives this score an earthy feel, which is very appropriate for the show. If I had to compare it to something, I would say it&#039;s reminiscent of the soundtrack found in Animal Crossing. Peaceful, calm, and uplifting music that can be listened to again and again, bringing a smile to one’s face with every listen. I highly recommend anyone reading to go listen to it if they’re able. You won’t regret it.<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp’s sequel season came when we needed it most. In a time where lies, deceit, and hatred are the currency of the realm, Yuru Camp shows the importance of kindness, friendship, extending a helping hand to others, and enjoying the natural wonders around us with those that we hold dear. The joy and laughs this series offers is abundant and undeniable, and I’m very eager to go camping once again with these girls in the near future.<br />

    &quot;Depression&quot;<br />
The feelings of severe despondency and dejection.<br />
Ex: Yuru Camp has ended, I have depression.<br />
<br />
Jokes aside, unlike Non Non Biyori, seeing Yuru Camp end is something that makes me feel sad. I know there is still more to come but the idea of this being the last time I may see them in an animated form is still sad. The anime is a complete mood changed. I remember seeing my reflection once while watching it and was surprised at the big smile I had on my face. Yuru Camp is one of the best and most relaxing mood-changing anime. <br />
<br />
For some reason, this season felt much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388779">
        better to watch than the 10/10 first season. Maybe it is my mood that changed it but it just felt much more refreshing. The atmosphere got much better and the inclusion of new characters was great. The camping areas were more visually appeasing and the characters themselves were given more time to flesh out. Seeing the inner thoughts of an unusually calm Nadeshiko was a nice change of pace. Seeing how much every girl cared about her friend showed you how much their friendship means to them. Seeing more Best Girl Aoi was enough for me to give this a 10/10 but the fact we see Akari as well was just too good.<br />
<br />
The art, animation and the comfyness were mixed very well with outstanding sounds to make a unique wholesome and relaxing atmosphere buzzing with positive energy to make you happy and help you with your life. <br />
<br />
Maybe all of this is biased due to how much I personally loved it but believe me, you NEED to watch this. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would give it a 10/10. One of the Goats of anime that had a flawless execution and way too good voice acting. <br />
Wpuld recommend the whole series to anyone I see in my life whether they love anime or not. Specially those suffering from depression or anxiety. We all need it.

    It&#039;s nice to see Yuru Camp continue its wholesome ways without deviating from what made it&#039;s first season so enjoyable. Much like before, the second season brings along with it even more camping endeavors as we follow our main group of girls. Yet no matter how many times I see them going for their next trip, it still feels fresh and exciting. There’s something new to be learned at every turn and new challenges are brought to the table. Sometimes, I feel as if I myself am right there with them learning about how to create certain meals or how to get by without an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388776">
        everyday necessity like access to the internet.<br />
<br />
The characters are still lovable as they were in the first season with some added interactions from their family members. Rin in particular is one of the show&#039;s highlights as her inner monologue paints her as a more charming and believable person. Many of her stumbles and struggles that she encounters while camping are oftentimes hilarious and relatable. Nadeshiko is still her upbeat and energetic self. Her taking initiative to go solo camping is the type of growth that feels right for her character as it makes her out to be someone with ambition. Aoi, Chiaki, and Ena also get their own time to shine and feel like fond members of this group each with their own quirky personalities. I’ve always quite liked the character designs in this show. Whether the girls are woefully looking at their phones or goofing off with some silly expressions, it’s all cheerful and heartwarming.<br />
<br />
Visually, the show is still beautiful with realistic backgrounds and artwork. The highly detailed environment and building interiors blend well with the general color scheme of the show giving off a nice calm atmosphere and fits perfectly with the relaxing vibes of camping. As far as sound goes, the voice acting is on point bringing each character to life. The soothing OST is fantastic with nearly every scene as it lulls you into a state of pure fluff especially during moments with little dialogue.<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is a rare breed of comfy, so much so that it makes me want to curl up in a sleeping bag on a nice chilly day outside. I enjoyed this show a great deal and I’m not just saying that out of pure affection towards the cute girls doing cute things genre. Slice of life in general can be hard to nail but when it’s done right, it can be a true wonder. This show managed to make me feel relaxed despite whatever mood I was in since there’s no drama and everything is consistently lighthearted and fresh.<br />
<br />
Though simple in its presentation and story, this show continues to display that it&#039;s often necessary to take a breather in life to appreciate the little things and sometimes that&#039;s more than enough.

    The beautiful and loveable camper girls are back, with twice (or longer) the distances of the camping journey, twice the moving action, and twice the fun, all in the same Iyashikei package as how Season 1 was like exactly 3 years ago from Winter 2018.<br />
<br />
To quote ANN&#039;s Christopher Farris (full credits to him, some parts paraphrased):<br />
&quot;Obviously there are anime with more grand storytelling ambitions and meaningful idea communication than C-Station&#039;s calculatedly comfy cute-girl camping compilation. But in a season, as with any other, that included projects walking a razor&#039;s edge of their own success or outright collapsing under their own efforts, Yuru Camp sticks out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388770">
        for the wonderfully consistent entertainment value it spins out of its humble content week after week. Actually...maybe ‘consistent’ isn&#039;t quite the right word: &quot;RELIABLE&quot; – that&#039;s what Yuru Camp is worth representing. It&#039;s the kind of show I&#039;d purposefully let myself get to later in the day: An atmospheric exercise in unwinding, and one that I could count on to be coherent in terms of presentation, production, or just those all-important vibes. Even in cases like the unexpected swerve into more serious storytelling (where I could charitably rechristen the series to ‘Stressed-Out Camp’), they never turn away from the natural course of its always-present edutainment elements to a literally heartwarming conclusion, using the situation to also demonstrate the bonds that followed these friends around even on their individual camping excursions.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s something Yuru Camp has always excelled at: Embracing the communicative culture of our modern world by letting the girls share their special times via sending texts and photos to each other. It&#039;s appreciably distinct from the anti-technology bend that you might expect from a series that&#039;s otherwise all about the great outdoors. And isn&#039;t that the perfect mash-up of exactly the kind of comfort food we need right now? A beautiful anime acting as a virtual travelogue for all the scenic spots we&#039;ll be able to make it to ourselves in the not-too-distant future (darn you COVID), and a reassurance that friendships necessarily maintained over digitized distances for the time being are still the valid connections we need them to be. Yuru Camp is a cuddly Iyashikei series that seems totally humble in its ambitions at first pass, but it humbly handles those ambitions perfectly. For example, Rin sending Toba-sensei to look after her friends in the freezing mountains, this show brought us some warming comfort at the exact time we needed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
And I have to say that I totally agree with his final commentary. In such a stacked season where we&#039;re all coming out from the depths of managing COVID better, and with every studio and production team trying to cash in on whatever projects (new or sequel) they can operate on to earn back some income (at the expense of health, I&#039;m looking at you CloverWorks with Wonder Egg Priority), it&#039;s the consistency of smaller studios like C-Station to just work effectively on just 1 show (or 2 at max) and keep the same production quality as their previous works. And going into Yuru Camp for its 2nd outing,  it&#039;s entirely the same as about what you&#039;d expect of the series if you&#039;ve watched Season 1 all those years ago: the same Outdoor Adventure Club cast with central leads Rin and Nadeshiko; the absolute perfection of C-Station&#039;s production quality to mimic the real-life shots of Japan&#039;s geospots from mangaka Afro&#039;s rough but delicate work; and every feeling and emotion that is worth the joyride of experiencing camping with friends for life, whether connected physically or technically.<br />
<br />
If I have to add what makes Season 2 pop out more of what Season 1 has already been established, it&#039;s more character development that adds the charm into what is already an endearing and relaxing slice-of-life show. In regards to both Rin and Nadeshiko, Season 1 is abscondly absent of their families&#039; POV (though there were some instances, but not a lot), and this sequel went in full with their involvement, which helps make the relations more heartfelt and heartwarming, not to mention the added experience of going through more learning lessons. Adding to that is the fact that the Outdoor Adventure Club has always been just Nadeshiko, Aoi and Chiaki for the most of Season 1. So to see that the camping journey team has expanded to the entire cast (Rin, Ena, even teacher-cum-advisor Minami Toba, even Aoi bringing in her younger sister Akari for double Inuko gag jokes) with their camping skills and know-how upgraded with age and maturity, it has been a dream come true for fans of both the manga and anime, and Season 2 exceptionally delivers that experience to a T. As with a new season that brings forth a new OST, while it isn&#039;t on the levels of memorability of Season 1, I&#039;d still think that both Asaka and Eri Sasaki did pretty consistently well with the peppy and Iyashikei-like comforting sentiments respectively.<br />
<br />
All in all, as everyone have shared in the same heartbeat: Yuru Camp is enjoyable and relaxing Slice-of-Life wholesomeness at its peak. If all the recommendations aren&#039;t doing you a great service already, then hop right into Yuru Camp, where the Great Outdoors are waiting for you: Ready to shine forth its glory, nourishing the very heart and soul of what it means to be a camper: being friends with strangers (that become life-long ones), whether camping in groups or going solo, and not forgetting to share and communicate the feels-good wonders that beckons the heart of hearts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just always smile and Seize The Day!<br />
Sunrise is waiting for us~<br />
(So life is wonder, It&#039;s precious time for us) Piece by piece~<br />
(Yes I&#039;m so happy, Shiny...) Yeah-heh~~~&quot;

    Did this season need to come out?<br />
<br />
No<br />
<br />
Was this season amazing?<br />
<br />
HELL YEAH YOU BET IT WAS<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp is one of the best Slice of Life&#039;s I have ever watched. You can watch this series without having a care for anything in the world, you really don&#039;t need to take anything seriously. There&#039;s no extravagant plot, no heart pounding suspense, barely any character development, yet Yuru Camp manages to be absolutely amazing. <br />
<br />
The amount of food porn that&#039;s in Yuru Camp is actually insane. Everytime there was a food scene, my stomach started creating an internal earthquake. It really didn&#039;t help seeing Nadeshiko drool all over her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388972">
        food.<br />
<br />
C-Station needs to make more animes, the visuals in this show are ABSOLUTELY stunning. The scenery throughout the show look so pretty and beautiful. I could literally close my eyes, pick a scene from an episode, screenshot it, and use it as my background.<br />
<br />
Yuru Camp might have the overall best theme songs and endings for a single series. The endings for Yuru Camp are my sleeping pills, it&#039;s such a soothing thing to listen to when you&#039;re about to go to sleep. The intros. MMMM. The intros are the exact opposite of the outros, but they are still amazing. <br />
<br />
The music used throughout this season is ridiculously good, they all fit the scenes they were used in, perfectly. Now, onto voice actors...holy smokes the voice actors are goddesses. I can spot Rie Takahashi’s voice from anywhere, and she happens to voice act Ena-chan. Hanamori was literally made for Nadeshiko’s voice, she has the most fitting voice for a cheerful, energetic and eccentric girl. Rin-Chan’s voice acting is another thing that’s an absolute masterpiece in this show.<br />
<br />
Nadeshiko is one of my all time favourite characters. Pink hair? Energetic and cheerful? Extremely cute and adorable? Yup, that&#039;s Nadeshiko, and she checks all the boxes for an astounding anime female. Loose ponytail Nadeshiko with hair swooping to her right easily tops all the forms of Nadeshiko. As of right now, Shima-Rin sits right outside of my favourites list, it always makes me smile looking at her small grin. I like Ena-chan for the sole reason that she is voiced by Rieri, and also that she has the most adorable dog known to humankind. <br />
<br />
Yuru Camp at night is the best time to watch it, I found this out personally. After watching the 1st season and this one, I learnt that I really need to go camping 1000x more often than I do. The overwhelming cuteness is exceptionally great, it really is a gift. I adore every part of this show, and my experience with it was very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Even if you despise the Slice of Life genre, I believe watching Yuru Camp will totally sway your opinion on the genre. When I first watched Yuru Camp it made me realize that a show doesn’t need any fancy plot to be really outstanding. Out of all the anime to air and finish airing during Winter 2021, Yuru Camp is the best. It is definitely worth a watch.<br />

    We didn&#039;t need it, we didn&#039;t deserve it, but we&#039;re gladly welcome it with open arms and smile. Once again we are greeted by a old friend, a wholesome experience all over again. It continues to just bring smile to your face as you just sit back and relax and enjoy the show. <br />
<br />
Not much difference from season 1, just adds more to why we love this show! If you didn&#039;t enjoy season 1 then don&#039;t even bother with season 2, as it isn&#039;t anything different really. It just adds more to their adventure as we see them just enjoying life. So stop worrying for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376164">
        a moment and just kick back and relax. <br />
<br />
With all the talk about all these other &quot;hype&quot; up anime, this is just one of those we needed in the midst of all that. One where we don&#039;t need to argue over or analyze. It&#039;s just one we can just all watch in carefree enjoyment.

    This is my first review, and my English sucks, so bear with me onegaishimasu ~༼ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽~<br />
<br />
C-station studio: &quot;So you watched the first season of yuru camp?&quot;<br />
CGDCT enthusiasts: &quot;Yeah, and it was amazing, but not sure if I&#039;ll watch another season.&quot;<br />
C-station studio: &quot;Don&#039;t worry, it gets even better than the previous season.&quot;<br />
CGDCT enthusiasts: &quot;That&#039;s what they all say.&quot;<br />
C-station studio: &quot;No wait, you don&#039;t understand, this season is as good as Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho and Nichijou.&quot;<br />
CGDCT enthusiasts: &quot;hmm, go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s begin, shall we now? Let&#039;s start with the characters.<br />
The characters are very charming and likeable, and they all contribute to each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388817">
        episode to make it far more entertaining and improve the overall quality of the show.<br />
If that doesn&#039;t entice you, I might, as well, mention that the anime is quite informative, teaching you not only about camping but also about how beautiful nature is and how comforting and soothing it could be to experience camping outside in nature.<br />
<br />
The animation, the characters, the backgrounds, the vibes, and the soothing soundtrack are all perfect for a chill anime. This show establishes a new standard that future CGDCT anime will find very difficult to match, let alone surpass.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a comfy anime.... This is the comfiest anime. <br />

    Rin-channnnnn! Shimarin and the girls are back for another super cozy season of camping and boy was it perfect. I really do not think C-Station could have done a better job on this show, every second of it is so amazing. Yuru camp never fails to leave me yearning for the outdoors after every episode.<br />
<br />
Yuru camp is exactly as advertised. Cute girls going on cozy camping trips, while also teaching you about the outdoors and the basics of camping. Watching this show probably makes me smile at least 30 times per episode, its just that cute. Just watching the girls saving up their money for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388782">
        camping trips, walking around a campsite, or just sharing a meal at a restaurant makes for a stellar episode.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are so incredibly top notch. C-Station has done such amazing work on the animation of this series. All the scenery and landscapes always look so beautiful. The soundtrack is also so perfect. The Opening and Ending songs are so cute and perfect for the show. The OSTs also are so fitting for this cozy show and sound very nice.<br />
<br />
How can you not love the characters? They are all so cute in their own way. Each girl has a different role in the group, and they all just take turns making me laugh and smile. All the girls are so cute and goofy I love them so much.<br />
<br />
I would have never thought that sitting down and watching a few girls go on a camping trip would be one of the most enjoyable things for me. If anyone is looking for a cute show, with cute characters just being super cozy, this is the one. Perfect in all aspects, I truly do not think Yuru Camp has a fault. Actually, there is one. That it must end! It hurts to say goodbye to this show for now, but man I am so glad I got to watch it. I cannot wait for the movie!! <br />
<br />
Yuru Camp Season 2 gets a very free 10 hot springs out of 10 from me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading &lt;3. <br />

    Smoking. Meditation. Masturbation. Lifting. These are all things people do to reduce stress, or to make them forget of the troubles in their life that haunt them. Me? I do all of these things, AND I watch Yuru Camp. Yuru Camp is slice of life in its most bare form, with the show focused on a cast of cute girls who go camping. That&#039;s all the show is. No drama, no romance, no major flaws in any of the characters - just cute girls camping. It&#039;s a mindless watch with bubbly lovable characters, beautiful art, and a fantastic soundtrack and sound design. This show cheers

        me up after an especially rough day, and that&#039;s all it has to do to warrant a 9/10 rating from me.<br />
<br />
Its story is almost nonexistent. While there are some faint traces of a plot and character development, almost every episode follows the same structure: a portion of the cast are camping together, while the rest of the cast are up to their own funny little stories. Nobody&#039;s praising the show for its story, and that&#039;s justified by me. The show&#039;s characters are also quite one-dimensional but they&#039;re all funny and have enough quirks to separate themselves from eachother. Now onto the shows best features: its art and sound.<br />
<br />
This show is total eyecandy accompanied by fantastic sound design and music. &#039;Every frame a painting&#039; has never felt so right to as a result of the dropdead gorgeous and seemingly handpainted backdrops. The characters too are animated smoothly and are expressive in their movements. Yuru Camp 2 is probably my most favourite anime in terms of visual achievement. The sound design is amazing too! Close your eyes during the parts where the acst are camping, and it feels like you&#039;re really there. The voice actors did a great job in bringing their characters to life too. Paired with a fantastic opening and ending, and you&#039;ve got a audio masterpiece right here.<br />
<br />
Overall (even though I only learnt this word a few days ago hehe), Yuru Camp 2 is peak iyashikei. It does such a superb job in putting you in a relaxed state, while also treating you to some beautiful shots accompanied by great sound design. There is literally almost no substance to its story, but that&#039;s okay with me. You will definitely not like this if you hate slice-of-life or the cute-girls-doing-cute things trope, but I&#039;d recommend this to everyone else.

    Yuru Camp Season 2 is anime that focus on high school girls do camping and other wholesome thing. This is a sequel for Yuru Camp. There are not a lot of difference between the first season and the second.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
Like the previous season, this anime story is so simple. There are no big problem here. But because the story is simple that does not mean this anime is boring. Because it is so simple you didn&#039;t have to worry how the story goes and you can enjoy the show. Also don&#039;t forget about the ending, it is amazing. I&#039;m almost cried during the ending because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401505">
        its just so amazing.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
The art in here is really really gorgeous. Also the background is memorable too. Like if i see an art about sea view, mountain view, or beach view, the first thing that come to my mind is Yuru Camp. Because this anime draw their background so reailistic. Even maybe when i visit Japan in future, i&#039;ll always remember this anime because the art. Oh yeah, and also the character desain really fit their personality.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
When it comes to sound, Yuru Camp is the best. I mean the BGM is just beautiful. It can make you feel safe and comfy. Like nothing wrong will happen just enjoy it. Both the ED and OP is relaxing too. Usually anime OP is cheering and colorful. This anime bring that aside, instead they give us relaxing and chill feeling. And also when they cook something the sound is so perfect, it is like real life. The chopping sound, the boiling sound, everything. <br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
They all are wholesome, even with stranger. And that&#039;s why i like the character development. Its like they want to make us be like them, nice with everyone. And without we even noticing, they actually make us always remember all the character here. Also don&#039;t forget about the narrator. Even though we can&#039;t see him, he still have a personalty. And i think that is a really good job there.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I am really enjoying Yuru Camp to the fullest. This anime can change your mood no matter what happen. Like if you sad or lazy, just watch this anime and your mood will change drasctically from sad to being happy. And it so usefull to cheer ourself up to do something more productive. I&#039;ll definetely rewatch this anime again in near future, so i can cheer myself up more.<br />
<br />
You should give this anime a try. It can make you relax and comfy. And also this anime make you want to do camping by yourself, which is perfect. Because camping can refresh your mind and maybe you can get some new friend in the campsite. Thats all i can say about this anime. Thank you so much for reading my review.

    I&#039;ll be covering Yuru Camp Season 2, and basically Season 1 while I&#039;m at it and I&#039;ll be very blunt: it&#039;ll remain the best anime in my heart until and overcoming the day I keel over and die. Very simple. But here&#039;s the preamble before I actually get into the exact reasons why I enjoy this little slice of life as much as I do.<br />
<br />
I think Yuru Camp is the anime-equivalent of chicken noodle soup for the weary soul, and I think that&#039;s why I&#039;ve rewatched the series over and over again. Season 2 just adds more episodes for me to rewatch now and in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395713">
        the future. It accomplishes what I seek in a slice of life anime, and I think it covers what people tend to gloss over and miss whenever they look for and think of a slice of life anime.<br />
<br />
Ask anyone to define a slice of life, and the general answer should be: make a bunch of characters, put them in a setting, and let them interact. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s wrong, but it&#039;s too general. I believe a slice of life is relatable and grounded above all, and a slice of life has those moments where you feel a sense of deja vu, or you can point it out and say: &quot;Hey, I&#039;ve had this happen to me before.&quot; I think for that reason, the general feeling it should give you is... nostalgia. There&#039;s a certain familiarity in these 2D waters that you&#039;re crossing, and a good slice of life—like Yuru Camp—should achieve that.<br />
<br />
Anime has always been an art, another platform, another medium for escaping to another world. I think most people, and especially the studious and more anxious people are often overwhelmed and when overwhelmed, feel the need to escape or distance themselves. Yuru Camp, an anime about girls camping... is a bit more than that. Yuru Camp believes in something, or at least I think it believes in something. It believes that we need to slow down and appreciate the smaller things in life, and it delivers that indirectly to those who need to slow themselves down. When you&#039;re going so fast and anxiously leaping to the next goal in life, everything else in life passes by in a blur. In Yuru Camp, what you miss in that blur is... relaxation, reconnection with friends and family and nature... and for the older folks or for those graduating high school or those moving onto (and maybe they&#039;re already in) college, it&#039;s the feeling of your golden days that maybe you haven&#039;t stopped to appreciate.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I can actually talk about Yuru Camp and why it holds such a dear and special place in my heart.<br />
<br />
STORY (10/10)<br />
&quot;You just gave a 10/10 to a slice of life, you absolute buffoon.&quot; Yeah. I did. Here&#039;s why. A slice of life does not have a massive plot about saving the world or defeating a definitive bad guy or changing the universe. It&#039;s about characters living their day-to-day lives and cherishing the moments among themselves. I think for this reason, Yuru Camp accomplishes its goal as a slice of life. Surprise surprise, it&#039;s not totally about camping. My heart is thoroughly warmed as the cast might stress on something as mundane as exams, a flashback to my high school days, making out the different approaches to an exam: either &quot;let&#039;s wing it,&quot; or &quot;let&#039;s not sleep for the next few days just to study.&quot; It brings me back to my days of constantly jobhunting, or what I spent a paycheck on, or understanding the freedom I have as I mature and become an adult. The camping sequences, whether it be the solo-camping Rin, or the group outings, made me feel nostalgic as I thought about loneliness and how comforting it is at times or how oppressive it is at times. The group outings made me appreciate my time with friends more, and that our time spent together is proof of our friendship and mutual love and respect. And the dynamic between characters and how they all interact with each other feels like a genuine relationship that you&#039;d find in any friend group or inner circle. There&#039;s a bittersweet feeling instilled as the anime goes on and you remember... &quot;at some point, this anime ends.&quot; These girls are in high school. At some point, they&#039;ll all graduate, each taking their own career paths and in time, their time with each other becomes more and more sporadic and uneven. With how grounded Yuru Camp is, you also remember... &quot;at some point, my own fun ends,&quot; and the same applies to you. At some point, you&#039;ll be growing up, hunting for jobs, maybe moving out, getting your license and the like. And that&#039;s why Yuru Camp teaches us to appreciate the Present so that we may sooner embrace the Future. It teaches us that life in the moment is all that matters, so we should pay mind to the small things that surround us: our friends, our family, and nature. We need to spend our time wisely, so as to appreciate and love the Present and what surrounds us, while also preparing for the harsh, blunt reality of the Future and in that darkness, search for the opportunities it holds.<br />
<br />
ART (9/10)<br />
Art is usually not something one thinks about when they&#039;re searching for a slice of life, but considering the ground that Yuru Camp covers, it feels like everything went into conveying a certain aesthetic, a certain warmth and feel, and above all, to appreciate the environment. You&#039;ll find plenty of lovely landscapes in Yuru Camp (both seasons 1 and 2) and maybe it&#039;ll teach you to look for those early morning sunrises and those late afternoon sunsets. It&#039;ll teach you to, whenever you look or step outside, really take in what&#039;s around you: rain or shine, snow or hail, hot or cold... it really is a beautiful world we live in. I have very minor, nitpicky grievances with the way that some CG looks, but it hardly ever comes for you to be super annoyed with it. In a slice of life like this, the visuals lend itself very well. There&#039;s a certain, somewhat faded and healthy palette that the anime and art style uses to instill an emotion of warmth and wholesomeness. The characters are all unique and distinguishable from each other in their own styles, and there&#039;s a lot that goes into the environments. Very good, certainly eye candy at some moments during the anime.<br />
<br />
SOUND (10/10)<br />
A substantial chunk of this rating comes from the music and ambient sounds throughout the anime. Music was done by Akiyuki Tateyama, and I most certainly enjoy the direction with the genre used frequently. Almost all tracks in the Yuru Camp OST could be considered folk music, and folk music portrays a feeling of family, of friends, of good times and a certain welcome vibe. It feels... &quot;local.&quot; It really calms you down and some of the slower pieces go well with just embracing the outdoors or even just vibing indoors, ambient music to go with thinking about yourself and how far you&#039;ve come. The ambient sounds are very heavy on trying to paint the feeling of the outdoors. The fire crackling, the gentle winds blowing, the rustling of leaves, the thwack of wood being chopped and broken apart... it makes you feel like you&#039;re camping with the girls yourself. You&#039;re right there with them, enjoying your own mug of hot cocoa and talking about your day and destressing.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (8/10)<br />
Each character in Yuru Camp has their own distinctive personality and appearance. All of them are very relatable in their own ways. Rin&#039;s mature and distant yet caring and intellectual character, Nadeshiko&#039;s carefree and energetic demeanor, Aoi&#039;s caring and hardworking attitude, Chiaki&#039;s drive to leadership with her own shortsighted imperfections, and Ena&#039;s sleepy and slow-paced feels—all of these assorted personalities provide interesting dynamics. Although you aren&#039;t gonna be expecting romance, you certainly feel their relationships deepen with the time that they spend with each other. All in all, with their characters so grounded and feeling so real, it plays into the genre well enough for you to identify yourself with a character or being able to point out and have a sense of familiarity with the relationships that these characters have.<br />
<br />
All in all, it&#039;s 3:44 AM at the time of review, and I love Yuru Camp. &#039;Til the day I die. Watch Yuru Camp, sit back and enjoy. You&#039;re not supposed to watch it all in one sitting, but you totally can if you feel like it. Take life one step at a time, because if you rush yourself trying to get ahead, you&#039;re gonna miss a whole lot of stuff that you would&#039;ve loved in the blur that passes by you. Love life, cherish the time you spend with friends and family, and don&#039;t get so caught up and entangled. Stay safe, fellas.
