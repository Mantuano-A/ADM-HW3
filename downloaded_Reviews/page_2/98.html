    You know that feeling when you don&#039;t really want to watch something but when you start doing it, amazingly, you have lots of fun? Well I do because that is what Slam Dunk is doing to me. It is about this basketball team in Shohoku highschool and its main character, Sakuragi, who tries to complete himself as a basketball player and gain the love of a girl, named Haruko. Sounds cheesy but, believe me, it is nothing you have experienced before.<br />
<br />
Now, from the first few episodes, you can obviously see that this anime, which received huge acclaim at its time, has a clear goal to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1591">
        spread the popularity of basketball in a country where basketball was almost non existent. For true fans of this game, who are hoping to see some great moves in this series, a disappointment awaits. The problem is that Japanese studio emphasized areas of basketball which aren&#039;t necessarily the most important and beautiful. For those true fans, it would be like watching a &amp;quot;learn-how-to-read&amp;quot; video when you&#039;re 20 years old. From this side, the anime looks really outdated. <br />

However, what amazed me the most, was that the jokes were not outdated at all. If you don&#039;t like the basketball scenes, watch it as a comedy and, trust me, you won&#039;t be disappointed. Through time, you get used to the characters and even start enjoy their stories. We&#039;ve all movies  about American high school teams who MADE it. This was something new for me and I did not give up on it. Love, basketball, friendship, competition and lots of laughs - this is what you can expect (and should receive) from Slam Dunk.    <br />
<br />
I can say this easily: there will be basketball fans who will hate Slam Dunk and there will be non-basketball fans who will love this anime. Just give it a try and if you&#039;ll have fun a few times - it was already worth it.

    This anime has almost everything. Action, comedy, tragedy, romantic tensions, manly moments, etc. The cast is pretty huge and when possible, each character or group gets their chance to shine. A great percentage of the characters each contribute something to the advancement of the story and/or get their moment in the sun so. It doesn’t have to be Sakuragi, or the rest of the Shohoku team. Even Sakuragi’s gang gets their chance to do something every now and then. <br />
<br />
But what really touches me about this story is how strong the relationships develop. Especially the loyalty of Sakuragi’s gang and how far they go in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review122925">
        their support that he gets to be part of the basketball team. Even though Sakuragi and his friends may not have the best brains, they make up for it with their hearts and this anime has a big amount of it. I know a lot of people are put off by the concept of sports anime, but I think people need to give this one a chance. The story moves at a very moderate pace and I found the characters to be very relatable and realistically portrays the culture of high school sports in Japan.<br />
<br />
Even though Sakuragi starts basketball to impress a girl, it is fun to see how he progresses and you really start to cheer for him like he was your friend that started something. Even though he was gifted with the perfect genetics for the sport, he still has to learn from the beginning and some of his struggles are just juvenile to those that at least know the basics of basketball, but you really feel his passion at the right moments and hope that he lives up to his fullest potential.<br />
<br />
Then you get to see the other characters not just on Shokou, but on the other team as well and how they also have their dreams and work just as hard to make them come true. There are no bad guys and everybody is relatable in their own way and each have something to prove. <br />
<br />
Earlier I mentioned the realistic aspects of Japanese school sports culture. In Japan, many high schools are known for their sports team and some kids are recruited to a school based on their athletic ability. This is most especially true in baseball where the Koushien, the high school world series, is a very big deal in Japan. I liked how they touched this from the coach of Ryonan High School. It is true that some students join a school to join a team that is coached by this particular person and I really like how they touch that. <br />
<br />
I really like the character design in this. Though it is a little difficult to transition from how Inoue-sensei did it in the manga, the anime works in its own that it just has this artistic distinction that still carries on today. I found the design to be very diverse and expresses many atmospheres within the story and between the characters. It can be very realistic looking, or very cartoony. Some characters have the generic anime design like Haruko, or look more realistic like her brother, nick named Gori, Gorilla for short. <br />
<br />
In a way, Sendo’s design in the anime kind of bothered me. He didn’t really look like a high school student by making his eyes more rectangular. In the original manga, his eyes were more circular and I thought the design there he looked more appropriately like a teenager and I will sort of address this issue coming across as older as he looks a bit later. However, the anime addresses at times about characters who look older than they look at times like Maki and at times Akagi. <br />
<br />
I really like how the anatomy of the players accurately reflect what a basketball player looks like. A slim-muscular like build meant for speed and high cardio. Of course naturally bigger players play center and very early, it shows that a certain percentage of centers and taller players like Shaq, Dwight Howard, and Wilt Chamberlain aren’t the best at free throws.<br />
<br />
The basketball games may bring the intensity of lets say a 1990s NBA game, but it is pretty fun to watch and in certain moments, the anime will explain the fundamentals of basketball for people who have no familiarity with the sport. At least the games are not anything like the games in Prince of Tennis where their abilities equate to killing the dinosaurs. So don’t expect any silly shit like that. Inoue-sensei referenced a lot of NBA pictures from magazines and the form that the characters show in their lay ups and slam dunks is just at that high level. <br />
<br />
Rukawa feels like Michael Jordan to me while Sakuragi is a lot like Rodman and Miyagi is like Mogsuy Bouggues. <br />
<br />
But I heard that some time ago, Inoue-sensei got in trouble for referencing very specific pictures and was in some copyright dispute over that which I think is stupid. Anybody who does art knows that artists reference al the time.<br />
<br />
The resolution and contrast will look a little grainy and rough, but I don’t mind it. I think it suits the delinquent and manliness of this series very well as opposed to looking it as outdated.<br />
<br />
The first opening theme alone, Kimi Ga Suki Da To Sakebitai just qualifies for a 10/10 in the sound department. It just brings this energy and intensity that accurately reflects the nature of the series about wanting to impress a girl and also doing your best. You can feel you’re one with the flow with the drum beats and the guitar licks. It’s a song we can all relate to. I feel if people make a list of top anime songs and does not list Kimi Ga Suki da to Sakebitai, they are not a true anime fan (and the only other songs I can say this for are Pegasus Fantasy from Saint Seiya and Heart of the Sword from Rurouni Kenshin). It is just so wonderful to listen to. <br />
<br />
Whenever you watch a high school basketball game in Japan, you are most likely to hear this song in the opening ceremony. Most times I have went to one, I would always hear this song and it shows how much Slam Dunk has had on basketball in Japan.  The other theme songs also bring the same qualities that reflect the nature of the series.<br />
<br />
Another reason for my 10/10 is just for Midorikawa Hikaru alone as the voice of Rukawa. He’s one of the best seiyuus of all time for crying out loud. He is very good at playing all kinds of characters from the enthusiastic Michael from Marmalade Boy, the romantic Tamahome from Fushigi Yuugi, the dark killer of Heero Yuy from Gundam Wing, and this time the anti-social Rukawa. He can play just about anybody. Sakuragi is played by another top name from the 90s, Kusao Takashi, the voice of Trunks from Dragon Ball Z. His voice is really more rough and scratchy. Even though as Future Trunks he sounded aggressive, he still had something of a soft voice. Along with the rough and scratchniess, at times it is appropriately comedic. In a way, it works in a well-rounded sense when necessary. <br />
<br />
Another seiyuu I happened to enjoy was the voice of Tanaka Hideyuki as Kogure, or Megane-kun to Sakuragi. In case you don’t know, he’s the Japanese voice of Otacon  and Huey from Metal Gear Solid. The design of the character has a physicality and look just like the Emmerich’s and I thought the voice just fit perfectly and I feel it was this performance paved the way for such a legendary role. <br />
<br />
As previously stated, I sort of had an issue with Sendo coming across feeling older than a teenager, I feel that also had to do with Ohtsuka Hochuu, the voice of Jiraiya from Naruto as his seiyuu. His voice is really easy to recognize if you are familiar with that particular role, but I guess his jokey and relaxed nature does bring a youthfulness to it in some ways. Sendo does have a sense of humor and I feel in some ways, his voice does reflect that. Then again, it doesn’t go into the extremes like in his performance as Chibodee in G Gundam where he calls Domon Japanese and Saisaishi Chinese and I just like the way he pronunciates it. The cast and music just go on and on and I feel for music lovers and seiyuu buffs, that alone makes Slam Dunk worth watching. <br />
<br />
Well, I know a good number of people on the internet are not fond of sports anime, but there is a reason why it has appeal, at least in Japan. Joining a sports club while still a student is really a big deal while it really isn’t too much of a big deal in America where us American tend to feel that sports if for douche bag jocks or whatever. Japanese schools, especially at the jr high level, encourage it more often because they feel it prepares people for society in some ways such as learning about team work, understanding senpai/kouhai relations, having a goal and working for it, having fun and hard work. To Japanese people, seeing that, they can relate to their own youth or what is going on in their lives if they are still students. <br />
<br />
To me, the opening song was just enough and it brought me back to the days of the 90s and how I loved the players of that era. <br />
<br />
But when watching, you will see Sakuragi grow. At times you will laugh at his stupidity and at times you will feel sorry for him. The series shows every aspect of what he goes through and you will see him grow. You will also see how his relationships with his teammates grow. He may be full of himself, but when the going gets tough, he will work hard and pull through. It’s an anime that shows that everybody has the potential at something. Some may be natural, some may need to work harder than others, but when you put your mind to it, all things are possible. <br />
<br />
Anyway, my big issue was that it ends where it only had 2 games left from the manga. The anime already introduced characters and yet it ends without solving those issues. It is as big as a travesty as the jinchu arc from Rurouni Kenshin not being animated. But the anime ending works in a way where you see Sakuragi grow individually but the manga shows how Sakuragi develops to the point on why the team needs him. I say after watching the anime, read the remaining manga.

    Slam Dunk is one of those classics of sports anime.  You always hear about it and wonder if it actually is the best thing since sliced bread.  Well, it isn&#039;t.  But it is funny and entertaining and worthwhile if you have the patience for it.<br />
<br />
Imagine GTO in high school and determined to learn how to play basketball to get closer to the girl he has a crush on -- tah-dah, Slam Dunk!  The story has the expected sort of &amp;quot;learn a skill, show a skill&amp;quot; repetitive story line common to a lot of sports and shounen animes, but it&#039;s punched up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3245">
        by a little delinquency, a little reformation, and a tiny bit of one-sided romance.  The one real downside to the story is the occasional trips into a DBZ/Naruto-esque timefreeze: sometimes one basketball game takes, like, 3 episodes and you wonder how it&#039;s possible that only 2 minutes anime-time have gone by in the last 20 real-time. ;)<br />
<br />
The art is a little rough sometimes, kind of typical for the time period.  There&#039;s a lot of panning across stills and repetitive looks at the same image.  It can be a little annoying, but I kept on reminding myself when it was made (1993-1996!) and I got over it.  The one thing that I noticed the most was probably the fact that the key on their court looks different from a real key in a NBA or Olympic court, but I decided to stop thinking about it a few episodes in.<br />
<br />
The character of the main character is what makes the whole thing entertaining, I think.  He is brash, tactless, rough and stupid -- and, for some odd reason, really funny.  Even when he gets on my nerves, he does something random and ridiculous and retarded, and it just ends up cracking me up.  He&#039;s always calling himself a genius (when he doesn&#039;t know how to do anything) and laughing in this obnoxious, cocky manner and making awful mistakes, but he&#039;s somehow loveable anyway and you end up rooting for him because he&#039;s just that charismatic.  The thing that&#039;s really nice about him is just how flawed he is... he&#039;s got natural athleticism, but he&#039;s far from being a natural on the basketball court and he&#039;s loyal, strong, and dedicated, but he&#039;s also impatient and hot-tempered and loud.  And he&#039;s really nicely backed up by a team of interesting, diverse guys who each (eventually) get their time in the limelight and each have their own personal struggles to overcome while striving to work together as a team.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed watching Slam Dunk -- despite the really slow pacing of some of the actual games.  It&#039;s funny in that rough, delinquent way that will be familiar to people who&#039;ve seen Hajime no Ippo and Great Teacher Onizuka.  If you&#039;re an American basketball-purist, you might have some issues with the show, but if you&#039;re just looking for a fun, classic shounen about some rough-and-tumble guys... you&#039;ve found what you&#039;re looking for.

    Slam Dunk is considered a pioneer of sports anime. All from its witty jokes to its inspiring speeches, it’s a masterpiece from the 90s. It teaches many valuable morals of life such as establishing strong bonds with each other, and to never give up. It’s an anime that’s been a part of my childhood, and I knew from its first episode that it would be hilarious. <br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
The plot was centered on our self-centered protagonist Sakuragi Hanamichi, a 189cm tall, 16 year old, delinquent who hates basketball. And in order to impress a girl, he attempts to play the sport, fails miserably at it, and even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184895">
        managed to pants the opponent who was the captain of the basketball team as well as the girl’s older brother. But even after all that, he still somehow managed to get on the basketball team.<br />
<br />
The anime itself is mainly set in the Shohoku High School. It’s the home to the Shohoku basketball team, a team that isn’t considered a threat in the Kanagawa prefecture of Japan. Mainly due to its lack of skilled players, the team is really a one man team, consisting of the team captain Akagi Takenori, or Gorilla as Sakuragi likes to call him. But with the new year rolling in several new players joined the team including the superstar first year Rukawa Kaede, and our protagonist the self-proclaimed genius Sakuragi Hanamichi. The entire story pretty much revolves around the idea of making it to the nationals, since it’s been the dream of the 3rd years on the team. <br />
<br />
Now that I mention it, dreams, and goals of all the characters really play a huge role in the anime. It’s been the major reason for a lot of the determination, passion, and character development in the show. I love this aspect because I find it relatable since in real life we all have dreams of our own, and it inspires us to work hard to achieve them. It’s also this aspect of the show that makes it one of the best slices of life animes ever.<br />
  <br />
[Characters]<br />
The anime focuses in on a huge cast of characters, not only the Shohoku basketball team but also players from other teams as well as Sakuragi’s troupe of nutjobs. Now having a large cast of characters can be a definite problem if not done right, but Slam Dunk takes its characters and uses them to its full potential. All the characters possess intricate, diverse, and likeable personalities. But the most important reason I love this anime was the immense amount of character development the characters portrayed. When the Sakuragi first debuted, I can’t say I enjoyed his character a lot because he seemed like a really arrogant, and selfish person, but by the end of the anime, he learned how to rely on his teammates, and treat them with respect, and because of that he became one of my all-time favorite characters in anime. <br />
<br />
Something I realized after doing some research was that the characters in the anime were actually based on real life basketball players in the 90s. Which is really cool because if you know basketball players, and watch the anime, you&#039;ll begin to figure out which character is which player in real life.<br />
<br />
[Art]<br />
Now for the biggest gripe people would probably have about this anime, I’m not sure about others, but I tend to hate outdated art styles, and if I hadn’t seen it when I was younger I probably would’ve never watched the show. The show was made in the mid-90s, so it’s typical 90’s art style, if you’ve watched other shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion you would probably be familiar with it. It’s usually a bit rugged, and rough since the art was hand drawn. And the character designs aren’t what we’re used to today, they actually look more lifelike. But it turned out to be not as much of a problem as it seems when I rewatched it, because you get used to the art after a couple of episodes. But if you seriously have major problems with watching animes with old art this might be a problem for you. <br />
<br />
[Sound]<br />
This show has the most amazing OP and EDs ever, they&#039;re old school Japanese pop music. They are absolutely excellent, they go along with the show so well, and complements the feel of sports. I&#039;ve read some of the other Slam Dunk reviews and I think they deserve a lot more recognition that they&#039;re given. The BGM were pretty compatible with the anime, I&#039;d really like to comment more about it but to be honest there wasn&#039;t much of it. Compared to modern sports animes Slam Dunk pretty much has a very little amount of BGM, but you&#039;d hardly notice it since it has tons of sound effects. <br />
<br />
[Overall]<br />
Overall though, Slam Dunk is amazing, no matter if you&#039;re watching it back in the 90s or right now. The art style might be a bit rusty but the amazing story and characters definitely make up for it. And if the thought of watching a sports anime turns you off, then watch it for the comedy, I&#039;m sure you&#039;d enjoy it anyways. I&#039;d throughly enjoyed re watching the series recently and it seems just as amazing as it was 10 years ago, it&#039;s truly a masterpiece, a masterpiece that inspires people for decades to go out and play some basketball.<br />

    Slam dunk is, in my opinion, the best anime i&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is a typical anime sports plot, a central character (hanamichi) who starts hating basketball but due to his love interest get&#039;s into the school&#039;s team and starst loving it. The difference from other anime is that it gives you a better point of view in what respects effort will make you the best. In most anime the central character makes a great effort and ends up being the greatest player in the world in no time, instead slam dunk shows you that you are not the only one practising, everyone else does so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12139">
        too. (I would have liked to explain more but it would turn into a spoiler).<br />
<br />
Art<br />
typical 90&#039;s anime art. I liked it and the characters express a lot.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Good I think, I don&#039;t know much about sound. the first opening is really great and is in concordance with the series feel.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
This is what makes this anime great, you just have to love every character. I&#039;ve never felt so close to any anime character than to hanamichi. I mean, I felt like i could actually touch him. Also all of them make you feel their emotions. I&#039;ve even cryed though it&#039;s generally a comedy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
If you don&#039;t enjoy this anime.... then mm go watch one you&#039;ll enjoy, and have fun, but I think you&#039;ll enjoy it.

Synopsis<br />
Hanamichi Sakuragi, your (not so) average hot-blooded High school delinquent joins the basketball team of his school to impress his crush Haruko who coincidentally is the younger sister of the team&#039;s captain Akagi. If it wasn’t for Haruko joining the team would be the last thing he’d ever consider doing. He hates the game of basketball since his last crush rejected him for a basketball player. But he ends up participating in team practice, unaware of the extent of his god-given

Plot/Story 10/10<br />
The main character Hanamichi represents the author Takehiko Inoue. He as well joined the basketball team of his high school for the sole purpose of impressing girls but ended up falling in love with the game. Kaede Rukawa, contrary to Sakuragi, is very popular with girls and Haruko, Sakuragi´s crush has taken a liking to him. This enrages Sakuragi and he sees Rukawa as his rival. The captain of the team Takenori Akagi is Haruko´s older brother. He dreams of winning the national Championship with Shohoku High. Later on Ryota Miyagi, a small point guard and Hisashi Mitsui, a junior high MVP join the team to try and help fulfill this dream of his.<br />
On their way to the National Championship Tournament, they face many strong teams and unique players, as well as numerous challenges off the court.<br />
<br />
Animation/Design 9.5/10 <br />
The art style is very typical for 90´s anime. Since it is a little older, the animation is not very fluent at times. However, I feel like the art and animation in their synergy perfectly provide a stage for the theatre of the characters&#039; feelings. <br />
Also, the art style is just one of my personal favorites.<br />
<br />
Characters 11/10<br />
I really loved the way the different characters were introduced, both to the viewer and each other.<br />
Takehiko Inoue somehow managed to give almost every single character a meaningful background and exciting abilities. It was very interesting to me how all Shohoku High starters are based on historic NBA players.<br />
Ryota Miyagi is based on Ex hornets player Muggsy Bogues, the shortest player in NBA history, who excelled through his speed and skills and is widely known for his role in the hit movie „Space Jam“.<br />
Hisashi Mitsui is likely based on Suns legend Jeff Hornacek who was a Shooting Guard for the majority of his career, wore the number 14 and wore a knee brace on his left knee.<br />
Kaede Rukawa is based on Michael Jordan. Both are their teams&#039; primary scoring options without being the primary ball-handler. They score mainly through Iso situations and are nearly impossible to guard in a 1on1.<br />
Sakuragi Hanamichi is based on Dennis Rodman, an absolute madman, Bulls legend and Kim Jong Un&#039;s very best friend. While Rodman wore a variety of numbers, one of them being 69 (he was the person who got the number banned) one of them was 10, which Sakuragi also wears. They both have rebounding as their main purpose and rim protection as their secondary task. Sakuragi also has some of Rodman&#039;s hardheadedness and crazy personality, although not to the same extent (Rodman had 16 wives, one of them being Madonna, another one pornstar Carmen Electra who he slept with on his Teams home court. He also randomly showed up cross-dressing, claimed to be bisexual and proceeded to marry himself).<br />
Takenori Akagi is based on Patrick Ewing, NBA all-time great and New York Knicks center. They share the same position as well as the same physical appearance.<br />
All the characters on the teams they face have unique play styles and incredible depth. In this show, you will never find just two characters that play, speak or look the same. <br />
Even the coaches, bench players and team managers have interesting stories.<br />
The character development is also absolutely top tier. Each character from the main cast faces intense challenges on the court but probably even more so in their lives off the court. They work on their personalities and attitudes and keep growing constantly throughout the show. The characters and their synopsis are incredible and in a league of their own.<br />
<br />
Audio/Soundtrack 10/10<br />
The soundtrack is very pleasant to listen to overall. Especially the first opening Kimi Ga Sukida To Sakebitai stands out and successfully mediates the vibe of Slam Dunk, exactly what a good opening should do. <br />
The sound effects are top tier, the squeaking of the shoes, the fans in the background make you feel like you’re really sitting in the stands. The atmosphere is unbelievably realistic and constantly adapts to the tide of the game.<br />
The voice actors are very talented and did a great job for this show.<br />
<br />
Impact<br />
(I recommend the video „How Manga Changed Basketball in Japan - Anime explained“ by Crunchyroll: https://youtu.be/9CNuuDhRGRY)<br />
The impact of Slam Dunk on Japanese, but also Asian basketball culture in general runs very deep and is absolutely undeniable. It inspired tons of Asian kids to pick up the game of basketball. It is hard to find an Asian person who hasn’t read slam dunk. This is why you see Slam Dunk references in almost anything basketball-related coming out of Japan. In the Animanga Ahiru no Sora for example you can see some of the characters mention that they got into basketball because of Slam Dunk.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
Overall this is the best anime I have seen. The plot is great and the art style is exactly my taste. The characters are very unique and have an incredible amount of depth. The soundtrack, sound effect and voice actors are also all top tier. Im a hooper myself so I might be a little biased, but I would recommend it to literally just everyone. Though it is an basketball anime, even people who normally don’t like sports anime or sports in general will enjoy this.

    Probably one of the best anime. And in my opinion best anime i ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
A novice basketballer, Sakuragi Hanamichi, from Shohoku High School who knows nothing about basketball and even hate it and looked down on it at first. But the girl that he likes recommended him to play and so that was how his basketball life begun. He joined the basketball team shortly after that. In the anime you will see how much he had improved from a newbie to a national basketball player. And you will see what his team and him had went through in the road to become national champion.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review384681">
        In terms of hardship and perseverance.<br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
The anime focuses in on a huge cast of characters, not only the Shohoku basketball team but also players from other teams as well as Sakuragi’s troupe of nutjobs. Now having a large cast of characters can be a definite problem if not done right, but Slam Dunk takes its characters and uses them to its full potential. All the characters possess intricate, diverse, and likeable personalities. But the most important reason I love this anime was the immense amount of character development the characters portrayed. When the Sakuragi first debuted, I can’t say I enjoyed his character a lot because he seemed like a really arrogant, and selfish person, but by the end of the anime, he learned how to rely on his teammates, and treat them with respect, and because of that he became one of my all-time favorite characters in anime.<br />
<br />
[Art]<br />
<br />
typical 90&#039;s anime art. I liked it and the characters express a lot.<br />
<br />
[Sound]<br />
The soundtrack is great, the music somehow makes the show come alive. From comedic situations to high tense action, the music delivers.<br />
<br />
[Overall]<br />
<br />
 nothing to say.. 10/10.. Masterpiece ...<br />

    The manga and anime started the basketball trend in Japan during the 90s and i decided to see how good it was. This was my first sports anime and I didn&#039;t expect much from it. Knowing that it was from Toei also didn&#039;t help much. But after the first three episodes, I was hooked for the ride. The characters were the thing that made me like the anime and also learned some nice basketball terminology along the way. The journey itself was filled with pretty intense matches and twists. It teaches some pretty valuable lessons that you can use in your life. Not to spoil

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411039">
        more, but after you finish it you should definitely start the manga because the anime doesn&#039;t cover the entire story.<br />
If you like basketball, then this is for you. If not the characters will hook you up for the ride to come. You won&#039;t regret it!

    Slam Dunk! Is a sports comedy anime telling a story of a school basketball team and a newcomer Sakuragi Hanamichi, who basicly joins the club just to get the attention of a girl after being dumped by girls way too many times in the past. And as you might guess, Sakuragi then truly gets interested in basketball after hard training and finding himself - what a surprise - a rival in both basketball and girl attention aspects. The story itself is pretty decent, maybe a bit too predictable though. The animation and sounds (music, voice actors etc.) in this anime is average, considering the fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11217">
        that this anime has seen plenty of years already. The characters are pretty much ok too but I found them a bit dull and simple in the long run. There should have been more depth to characters fit in 101 episodes in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Slam Dunk! Was a huge disappointment to me since I heard alot of people complimenting the manga. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, Slam Dunk! is funny, atleast for the first 30 episodes. After that is just keeps on going way too repetitive and slow and to be blunt I think this anime has like 60 episodes too many. Personally I almost had to force myself to watch the last 20-or-so episodes just out of the custom not wanting to leave anime half watched. <br />
<br />
So if you are looking for a good sports comedy anime you should start with Hajime no Ippo or Prince of Tennis instead. That atleast is my opinion of the matter. If you are looking for an anime that you can watch you left eye closed and maybe even skip a few episodes here and there and still know where the plot&#039;s going then go with Slam Dunk!<br />

    The best sport shounen anime. The first time i find anime without ECCHI STUFF, OPPAI, YAOI, AND MORE SEX OR DIRTY STORYLINE,. THE BEST ANIME EVER. The comedy is not hard to make us laughing. The story is simple, but we find many twist. Each episode show how a hero born from zero. The art stile is old and mature.<br />
<br />
The background song while Sakuragi do rebound will always ringing in your head. <br />
The character have go through great development in every episodes. I do believe this anime will be popularize basketball much more all over asia. The only way to enjoy this anime is believing

    Instead of writing a paragraph of review, I will basically list all the good things I thought abou tthis show:<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
The story is very well presented. Instead of focusing solely on basketball, it also shows the lives of the characters; character development will develop during major story arcs and not through filler episodes. Speaking of fillers, unlike other animes wher fillers are usually unwanted, in Slam Dunk fillers are very fun to watch.<br />
<br />
SOUND/MUSIC:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is great, the music somehow makes the show come alive. From comedic situations to high tense action, the music delivers.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
<br />
The characters are especially unique in this anime why? Because they continue to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18478">
        develop throughout he story. <br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
<br />
This anime is the perfect casual anime for anyone who wants to take a break from mind-boggling shows like Death Note or action-focused animes like Bleach or Dragonball (DBZ can be debated :P).<br />
<br />

    This anime is straight 10 in every aspects for me. I had watched first time when I was 6 six years old with its limited episodes on TV. Slam Dunk is the reason why I started playing basketball and loved that sport so much. It increases popularity of basket not only in Japan but in other countries. <br />
<br />
The story is evolved around our tensai basketball player Hanamichi Sakuragi. At the beginning he is person who hates basketball a lot (I do not want to give its reason because of spoilers, you will figure it out at the very beginning of the serie). But that attitude

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202720">
        was changed when he met with Haruko. Through the whole serie it is amazing to see how he develops from a punk to a decent basketball player. Anime gives that feeling splendidly.  It is like something inside you is developing with every improvement he made. It can be emotionally or mentally.<br />
<br />
Characters have also strong position in here. Their background and goals were given to viewers very well as well as introduction of some of them. Also their relationships are unbreakable. <br />
<br />
In art based it really looks old school and I like it so much. So much 90s are all over it. The most lovable thing is funny appearance of their faces in some situations. It fits to the characters perfectly. I wacthed a lot anime, Slam Dunk makes this situation simply awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all Slam Dunk is my first anime that I watched. It was the start of everything for me. And it will be always in my hearth as my first and the best anime.

    I have watch this anime since forever, I started watching it when I was a kid, forgot what age I was, I started obsessed with it. I try to join the basketball team in my school but I didn&#039;t get chosen. Then, after years, I started watching it again when I&#039;m in high school, and obsessed with it again. I felt like watching it for the first time, and it was exciting because I couldn&#039;t remember much. But after that, I started download the anime and it has been my source of enjoyment. That is how I am obsessed with this anime. <br />
<br />
But, still there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219958">
        are things that bothered me. Especially with the art, I mean its outdated. I sometime can&#039;t stand it because I want more visual graphics because now it&#039;s 2016. My eyes gets sore when I see that kind of quality. But the manga is good art though.<br />
<br />
The BGM is really my taste. The sound and especially the intro has been embedded in my heart. I recognize it when they play one of the Slam Dunk BGM in Running Man Korea. Haha, think I not notice it?! The guitar riff is cool and they fit really well with Slam Dunk. I really wanted to give the guys credit for the BGM.<br />
<br />
The character is funny, even when they are serious. Slam Dunk is one of a few that can stand out each of the character perfectly and realistically. Start with our hero, Sakuragi Hanamichi, he&#039;s a newbie in basketball, and his main reason to join in is because of a girl, but slowly in the story, he started to like the game. As the story goes on, Sakuragi started improved his game little by little and end up shocking the whole nation. Maybe. But Takehiko Inoue really making his character stick to a more realistic improvement. There is really not much to expect to see Sakuragi being skillful but his athletic ability and power will certainly shock the viewer as well as the character in the story.Although I really wanted to see Sakuragi improve much better but... the story only show the 3 months of Sakuragi joining the basketball, so to say 3 months playing can&#039;t make a person skill improve much.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime is fine as hell. There are a lot of character who are skillful but I am not going to spoil it.Just watch the story and enjoy it as it is.<br />
<br />

    One of my favourite animes since I was around 7 years old. It&#039;s hilarious, has the perfect amount of drama, comedy, suspense and action (in it&#039;s own rights). Always love re-watching and re-re-watching episodes whenever I&#039;m bored. <br />
The main character, Sakuragi Manamichi always seems to bring my spirits up as a basketball player and also makes me laugh with his comedic features. <br />
His attitude and his drive to become better and overcome his weaknesses is also rather inspiring. <br />
Overall a brilliant anime, one of my favourite. Though what I hated was that Inouie-sensei didn&#039;t continue and left us hanging right before the Inter-high... really frustrated.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168103">
        I hope they continue and come up with something soon with better animation quality.

    I&#039;m a little biased, this is my favorite anime/manga of all time. And as it turns out, not just mine. Slam Dunk has been voted as being Japan&#039;s favorite manga of all time. Takehiko Inoue is also one of the most revered and acknowledged mangaka ever. Following Slam Dunk, he has created several other masterpieces, namely Vagabond which I haven&#039;t read yet. But apparently it has received some very distinguished awards. But regarding Slam Dunk, it&#039;s not like Kuroko where the characters are dramatized by the color of their hair, by special abilities only relevant in sci fi. It&#039;s a lot more realistic, and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205493">
        emphasis is a lot more on the story and the blending of characters. It is one of my life&#039;s saddest truths that the anime does not finish the story of the manga. And the ending of the manga is bittersweet in that it&#039;s the greatest possible ending imaginable, but it might leave you begging for more as well. That&#039;s genius. I still remember to this day, reading the final chapters of the manga where the anime left off, and it&#039;s definitely the greatest story I&#039;ve ever read, with the greatest art of any mangaka in regards to the drawings of the emotions, the panel distribution, taking advantage of the anticipation from one page to another. There&#039;s been nothing like it. And that&#039;s evidenced by the fact that Slam Dunk has sold over 120 million copies, being a sports manga! That&#039;s unprecedented.

    Slam Dunk, the first thing it&#039;d tell me is Basketball! :) i&#039;ve been playing bball for sometime now, and this anime was out just before i was born:) <br />
<br />
Story - Very good story even though there are some parts i dislike :) especially when some people are soo dumb and couldn&#039;t figure things out!<br />
<br />
Art and Sound - ofcause this anime is very old, the only thing i&#039;d say is, compare to the anime&#039;s being made nowadays, this anime&#039;s art level isn&#039;t at the top, but however, some fighting scenes used in this are still &#039;&#039;classic&#039;&#039; :)<br />
<br />
Character - i must say, the characters from this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5918">
        is very good, especially hanamichi (sry if i spelt him wrong :)), he&#039;s a very funny character, i&#039;ll give you that :)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - i pretty much enjoyed 99% of this anime, :) i watched this ZELION TIMES :) cuz it was soo enjoyable :) <br />
<br />
Overall - I love this anime soo much :) but nowadays, with all the new animes out such as Vampire Knight, Nabari no Ou, Bleach/Naruto, Code Geass R2, PoT NT, i dunno, much more :), i dont really have alot of time to come back to this enjoyable anime, i just ocationally watch the ending of this anime :) because its fun... anyway, this anime have alot of funny parts :) and is a very good anime to watch. i only wished they could carry on the inter-high tournament :( sadly they only had manga for that :(<br />
<br />
thanks for reading :) this is based on my experience and is my 1st review :)

    For a anime to be called Slam Dunk one of the most flashy, epic, move that blows away anyone watching, to then be so tedious and incomplete that I would have dropped it from the start. <br />
<br />
Slam Dunk is jammed pack full of flat characters that make the same boring jokes and overall just annoy you the longer you watch. Making it all seem nothing is changing. If that weren’t enough recap and flashbacks are a constant occurrence too. Man what does this anime got going for it? <br />
<br />
Not only is the general story a snooze to live with but so is the protagonist Sakuragi.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291857">
        He is the character that really can grind your gears, whether its when he get angry fast, using his loud mouth to get in trouble, being dense, embarrassing himself, or having a inferiority complex, he is a nuisance at best. Whenever he is on screen you just kinda feel pity for him but maybe in reality it’s just you slowly losing brain cells having to watch the mess that is Sakuragi.<br />
<br />
Other characters like Rukawa also get old as well but they are usually the exceptions as the rest of the main cast are generally respectable and inspiring. The same can be said for the side characters like Sendou, Youhei, and the coach, they fit their roles and do it well. <br />
<br />
Venturing onto animation and art it’s what to expect for its time. It’s solid and was probably insane for its time and even now it does the service proudly. But definitely not for the haters of old art styles or old anime in general. I mean the the show walks at a snail pace, how else could they pad up 101 episodes and not even finish it!<br />
<br />
Anyway, Slam Dunk is a like a bag of questionable trail mix. Some parts pretty great, full of suspense and cool showdowns, but the other vast majority seems fishy or at least off in some way, leaving you feeling unsatisfied when they don’t finish off the story. All you can do then is look back at those so called epic moments and then realize that they were just slow action moments that squeeze your soul out.

    Slam Dunk is probably one of the most beautiful sports anime I have ever come acrossed. It is one of those animes that will be forever be memorable once you have watched it.<br />
<br />
For those looking to understand basketball, this is the anime for you. <br />
For those who are just looking for a good laugh, this is it. <br />
And for those who just want to be moved, I greatly recommend this anime and it&#039;s a thriller. <br />
<br />
Though, it may seem like just another typical sports anime at first, it is  not. Slam Dunk is one of the few animes out there that can actually make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23412">
        the viewers cry, laugh, and  fall in love with not one but all of its characters-- not because of their extremely good looks or their perfectly good charm(though that wouldn&#039;t hurt) but though their individuality, friendship, teamwork,  passion, and determination to reach a team goal.<br />
<br />
UPS:<br />
- Simple  fun characters with realistic goals!<br />
- Creative and memorable comedy<br />
- Suspense that could make you heart actually pound<br />
- Moving. very moving. <br />
- great audio great illustrations<br />
<br />
DOWNS:<br />
- The anime ended quite differently from the manga. The manga, obviously, being the one with the better end.<br />
- It&#039;s a little outdated.<br />

    Slam dunk is one of the anime which is pretty well known. In my opinion this anime is over hyped with no content to support it. First the story, the story in itself feels a little dull. I said dull because in over hundered episode the story could have been amazing. I will not spoil the story, but trust me this anime have a little content for a 101 episode anime. The matches are long ( episode wise), smallest match I ever seen in this anime was 5 episode long. You feel bored in half way through the anime. The character development feels well paced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190568">
        and character are good. The characters helps put the comedy element to the story.<br />
<br />
In the end, the story feels stretched, but it feels a little good because of the character in the story. I would refer this anime if you have nothing to do and want to pass time.

    It was the greatest sports anime I have ever seen! It was also funny when it came to Sakuragi! Hopefully what I heard is true about Slam Dunk coming back! I really want to watch Season 2 of this anime! Let&#039;s hope it does!<br />
I was honestly surprised this was considered Shonen, but I guess I did not know the definition of it. Either way, I really hope they do make another season of this. Actually, I hope they finish it rather than finishing it at a specific arcs like other anime series does.<br />
I can understand why, but I just want to see it complete since
