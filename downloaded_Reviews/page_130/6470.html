    Unfortunately for game anime adaptations, they have a steep hill to climb to recapture the magic you get from playing through them.<br />
<br />
Persona 5, another addition to the long time SMT/Persona series was a huge success in both the west and in Japan. It won 2017 Game Awards “RPG of the Year” And was ranked at was of the top games of the year by many gaming outlets. Even with that, the anime was considered a disappointment from the start. With its cheap animation, off-pacing at times, and generally its lack of what made the game special.<br />
<br />
However, my expectations played a part in the viewing experience.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290393">
        It was clear from the start that this wasn’t going to be like the game at all, as most game adaptations never are. Persona 5’s stand alone story is not what made the game special, rather just one factor. I wasn’t coming into this expecting what I got from the game, and neither should you. As I do see where most the criticism comes from, the root of it is from people who compare to the game, this probably isn’t a fair way to look at it. The game was made by thousands of more people, have had years to develop, and is generally taken more serious. This was a direct result of poor animation, bad pacing, and cutting out parts of the game. The anime should be given some slack in that regard.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, I am not trying to defend the bad parts of the P5 anime. They are noticeably apparent, and part of why it led to widespread hate of the P5 anime. The animation is sometimes shit. The CG usage was often bad, especially in the background characters walking around. The faraway faces are sometimes laughable. And although the pacing is considerably better in the second half of the show, the beginning is way too fast. Usually I wouldn’t give these issues a pass, but like I said since it was mainly being compared to the game I do. People who haven’t played the game probably won’t see that much of an issue in these.<br />
<br />
In many cases however, what likely appealed to you in the game should transition into the anime. If you like the characters, they will translate nicely. And of course, the music does as well. Chances are you didn’t complete everything in the game unless you played it through multiple times, so some of what you will be seeing from the characters could be a new experience. The character development was taken from the ‘confidant’ system so if you didn’t complete everyone’s confidant or maybe just were not paying attention you could be seeing new content. That along with the actual anime exclusive scenes, like seeing some of the characters in new situations, or seeing them given more backstory like showing them as children, gives the anime merit to watch even if you have played the game, a common criticism.<br />
<br />
There isn’t always something to say about P5TA. Largely because it is just doing what it was supposed to. There are both good and bad parts. If you want to experience the game but don’t want the time investment of playing through all of it, (and trust me, the game is huge) than this might be for you. If you are a fan of the game, than this might be for you. It doesn’t necessarily show everything the game has to offer, but doesn’t do anything too bad to diminish it either.<br />
<br />
You shouldn’t think too hard about this one.<br />

    Persona 5 is the newest addition to the Shin Megami Tensei franchise. Its source material had around 5 hours worth of actual content like is implied in its name, yet playing the whole thing takes around 140 hours because it&#039;s a classic J-RPG game that relies on repeating the same thing 18500 times. <br />
<br />
Unfortunate for the fans of the game, the anime end up being 26 episodes long when it should have been 500, and unfortunate for anime fans, the anime end up being 26 episodes long when it should have been 13.<br />
<br />
As far as fillers go, filler is canon content I mean, Persona 5

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290383">
        is full of slice of life nonsense that has nothing to do with anything. People fighting over pieces of bread and talking about their dreams just to make sure the pacing will become harder to comprehend than the popularity of the franchise itself. <br />
<br />
What is directorship? is what I found myself often asking when seeing how Persona 5 is build to be nothing but a collection of random scenes that were edited together without any consistency or flow that makes the next scene related to the former one. Screen transitions seem to be some sort of &quot;worst animated cabbage&quot; meme when the focus goes from pan fights in the middle of the day to a scene where we drink coffee in the evening to a bully scene and finally returns to a scene where the actual pan is being eaten in a time that seems to be the very next day. The shots mainly remind me of Resident Evil The Final Chapter (movie) where the camera angle could change 45 times a minute over the same scene except here it changes from scene to another in ludicrous tempo. Visual storytelling at its finest. Bravo. <br />
<br />
Our main characters are incredibly random. They mainly remind me of Suicide Squad. By Suicide Squad, I mean every superhero movie ever because that thing was exactly as good as they all are. The real mc is some sort of mixture of Robin Hood and Jesus. The female lead appears very mysterious, but the real mystery is why would anyone care. She is pretty hot, tho. The blonde dude is like spiderman but sassy. All the other girls were just swag, but gladfully there was like 7 beach episodes so they really had time showing off their naked bodies as it&#039;s not like they had anything else to show. None of the side characters feel like genuine persons, they are more like NPC&#039;s who only exist for the main characters... oh wait. <br />
<br />
What is this series all about even, you ask. And that&#039;s what I am still wondering. Teenagers with stand powers are participating inside some sort of fighting tournament shonen storyline that mainly reminds me of Katekyou Hitman Reborn (we even have the same mascot here) except the comedy was replaced with some type of combination of angst and edgy, the villains are evil adults, the actual events are Robin Hood with superpowers and most of it is slice of life. As epic as it might sound, what it really sounded like was a wet fart. <br />
<br />
The only good thing about the game itself was the OST. Unfortunately, voice acting is always at louder volume than the OST, and SFX above all else. Boy don&#039;t we love it when explosions cover the music. It really fits the definition of a background music because instead of trying to make the series better by using the songs to their full potential, they are just there hanging in the background. It&#039;s pretty much a stupid decision. <br />
<br />
Our art is at least pretty fun if not otherwise impressive. Villains wearing strings and cloaks made of fur offer the most original content in the entire series. Some of the leather suits were also pretty sexy. Especially the art room looked cool as fudge. Too bad its overall screen time totaled 3 seconds. Like literally. Not that even these things would be worth of praising in a series that had some other merits. Pretty much all side characters follow the &quot;spot the main character&quot; tier filler/design.

    So far, this adaptation has been a massive disappointment. <br />
<br />
A-1 pictures are known for their generic character designs and cutting corners when it comes to animation, so when adapting a game as stylistically brilliant Persona 5 it was obvious they wouldn&#039;t live up to the game’s highs. I never expected it to surpass or even match the game’s quality, but with a director as talented as Masashi Ishihama (Shinsekai Yori) expectations were raised and this adaptation’s first six episodes have flown far below them. <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
A 100+ hour game stuffed into 24 episodes will inevitably have pacing issues, and this has its fair share. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280379">
        story is rushed as hell, but so far it has given us the most important information to give us a surface level understanding of the world and plot. Any depth the game&#039;s story offered is for the most part missing. The themes of adults in positions of power abusing their roles have been boiled down to “grown-ups bad, kids good”. Like most of this adaptation, any half-hearted attempts at storytelling feel like a low effort recap to advertise the much better video game. <br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
We have only met Ryuji, Ann, Morgana, Yusuke, and the quiet main character called Ren in this adaptation. They all feel like cardboard cutouts with a fraction of the personalities of the game&#039;s counterparts. Trying to stay as faithful as possible to the game has hamstrung the character arcs, story beats are trimmed down or skipped entirely so we can&#039;t get a sense of who the main cast are from this show. The game itself was not perfect with characterization either, which is expectedly not fixed in this adaptation due to the insistence on staying as faithful as possible rather than letting the anime stand on its own merits. <br />
<br />
There’s plenty of inconsistencies in their arcs and annoying quirks that made some of them hard to like before they received development. These annoying quirks, like Ryuji’s obnoxious attitude and lack of self-awareness, become almost all there is to the characters. There just isn&#039;t enough time for each cast member to be developed beyond a surface level.   <br />
<br />
Even those inconsistencies in development are already appearing. In episode 4 Ann announces she’s finally free of the twisted pervert Kamoshida who was sexually objectifying her, but because this is a lovely A-1 Pictures anime, the camera is constantly shoved uncomfortably close to her butt. You could argue plenty of fanservice is necessary for the studio to secure a budget, but it is so opposite to the message the game was trying to convey. Effectively undoing any development that came from what should have been the most monumental battle in the first quarter of the show. <br />
<br />
Art: 3/10<br />
Action scenes are where the series looks the worst. It constantly uses this laughable shortcut of zooming in and out on unanimated shots to reuse them at a different resolution in a later scene. There’s somehow less animation than the game, and what we see tends to be worse. Look no further than the ‘epic’ boss battle in episode 5, what should have been amazing was stilted by hideous CGI that looked even worse than what was used in the game. The action is so boring to watch too because there are next to no stakes, usually, the Phantom Thieves are fighting random mobs but even the boss goes down so quickly. <br />
<br />
The fight choreography is even worse, the whole battle scene where Ryuji awakens his persona is the worst case of it. There is next to no fight choreography at all, hits don&#039;t even feel like hits, it&#039;s more like colors flying around with sound effects added over it. And somehow the all all-out-attack is so much worse than the game’s even though it was practically ripped straight from it.<br />
<br />
Character designs are the best part of the visuals because they’re lifted straight from the game, but they only look good when they’re totally motionless or on an animation loop (very often). When there&#039;s not much movement and/or character close-ups look really good but by that logic, you should just play the game.<br />
<br />
There’s also plenty of ugly CGI random people walking in the background. In episode 2 Ren and his teacher are talking in a hallway, and there’s a giant CGI student trying desperately to walk without looking like a robot but its so obvious he was stuck on there last minute with zero quality control to fix him. He looks ridiculously unpolished and the perspective is all messed up, he goes past two girls standing near a door and he looks twice as large as them.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Persona 5&#039;s OST is amazing, but here it&#039;s lifted straight out of the game and overused with not care for if it fits the scene or not (usually it doesn’t). You can easily tell when they use stock sound effects, deafening the punchy effects of the game’s combat for the sake of something easier on the ears but infinitely more forgettable. Yes, they fixed the OP and it is decent now, but the ED is still just a still image with limbs and hair being animated to look like the main cast is walking. It looks so uncanny, a completely still image would have at least not distracted from the pretty good song. <br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
I honestly can’t see this getting any better, but I love the game and respect the director enough to see if it can repair the story/character issues. I’m not expecting the art to get better because it seems as though they’re stretching the budget out to meet 24 episodes. <br />
<br />
If they try to simplify the character designs to be more fitting to a TV anime budget rather than solely faithful to the game, it may become more manageable for A-1 to animate. Also, I&#039;ve referred to CloverWorks as A-1 a few times, there&#039;s no difference. It&#039;s a subsidiary of A-1 so they&#039;re the same.

    LOOK HOW FAR WE&#039;VE COMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEE<br />
<br />
Hoy lads, I was quite excited to see my first review make it front page so thanks for that but now that the anime is done I guess I have to write this again. Most of my opinions haven&#039;t really changed so bits and pieces will remain the same. Swearing to Brahman didn&#039;t really help save this anime and P5A only slightly picked itself up towards later episodes. Atlus still should not be tolerating this kind of quality and I do sincerely hope they get out of whatever sort of contract they&#039;re in before they decide to ruin another property. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290455">
        begin, no spoilers. As someone who is passionate about the Megami Tensei franchise as a whole, and adore the Persona entries, I felt obligated to just... say what I&#039;m thinking, give a little rant ya&#039; feel? Aight, cool. Let&#039;s go. <br />
<br />
P5 was my game of the year last year and is one of my favourites in MT as a whole. Lots of things they could work on, but nevertheless it&#039;s a brilliant entry with a brilliant story, characters, art, music, etc.. If you&#039;re wondering whether or not the *game* is worth your time, then yes. It probably is. Please don&#039;t go looking at this anime for your answers because, well for fuck&#039;s sake, you won&#039;t find them here.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANIMATION: <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the big one. The animation is hilariously poor and it kind of pisses me off. The P3, P4 and to an extent DeSu properties have been treated quite nicely (except for P4G which was atrocious and made me want to die), and hardly did I ever cringe at any 1 frame. P5 however. Heh heh heh... uh, well let&#039;s just say I&#039;ve made a separate Discord to Jack Bros that just holds a bunch of cropped screencaps of characters.<br />
<br />
From the awkward running cycles shown in the first couple of minutes of the first episode to the new, overly lazy All-Out Attack meme scene of the second episode and out of place CGI characters roam the corridors and street to episode 12&#039;s (~9:30) scene where they tried to zoom out on a character but the character layer and the background layer were done to two different levels of zoom so basically the kind of shit I accidentally did in my 2011 YouTube videos and like how the fuck can this go unnoticed my god. I&#039;mma take a breather. And we back. Okay. I also liked when they got too lazy to animate Makoto so they brought out a low quality P5 model in episode 11. <br />
<br />
Whoever is animating this bullshit is in it for the monetary gain. They&#039;ve been given one of the most well received RPG franchises and it just seems like they don&#039;t give a shit about it. Ironic considering P5&#039;s story. <br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
Shoji Meguro is still a god with music. Whatever he creates makes me the very happy. The first opening song is brilliant, the second opening song is brilliant, the ending song is brilliant; Lyn&#039;s voice is just great and Shoji knows how to create music. What little new stuff I&#039;ve heard has also been pretty good. Actually using his music at the right moments however is a different story. I&#039;m primarily thinking of the Ryuji awakening scene at the moment, the song choice and awkward sync made me (personally) cringe a little and took away from what should have been a very powerful moment for the character, like it was in game. <br />
<br />
On top of all this, episode (12) had begun using P5D music, in particular the Jazztronik remix of Wake Up and ATLUS Konishi&#039;s Blooming Villain. Considering P5D was released like a week ago from this episode&#039;s release, their inclusions made me feel like the episode had only been completed recently, implying it was rushed. They might&#039;ve gotten the rights to such music beforehand, but I personally believe they would&#039;ve used more remixes in earlier episodes had this been the case. I had a discussion with a friend about this and they said it could&#039;ve been a marketing strategy for Dancing but using random songs doesn&#039;t seem like it would accomplish anything in my personal opinion.<br />
<br />
Guess I should also mention that the sound design in terms of effects and ambiance is quite poor. I made a note of episode 16 having used stock sound effects, or what sounded as such, but either way it sounded very unprofessional and cheap. <br />
<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
The pacing feels awfully fast and unnatural, with them cutting out a bunch of stuff that ultimately added to the game&#039;s story and development of characters. They cut out the part where Kamoshida asks Ren if he wants a ride where he says &quot;Nah&quot; and that. That. I was sitting there, anticipating the &quot;nah&quot; but they didn&#039;t do it and I was just blue balled y&#039;know. Cried a little even. Jokes aside, with 24 episodes I thought they&#039;d not need to be rushing but look how that turned out with that 2 episode extension. Tips for next time: focus on filtering out the stupid long and drawn out shots of the fucking rain. <br />
<br />
Also as a quick note, watched the show on Crunchyroll where they awkwardly linked Kamoshida to being in a train accident in the first episode or something and then relate that accident indirectly to the phantom thieves... which never happened in the game nor really happens in the anime. It was just worded really poorly.<br />
<br />
I like how they ended the show with an ambiguous ending, did we get the &quot;good ending&quot; or the &quot;bad ending&quot; thing; obviously leading to their OVA but it was nifty none-the-less... at least in theory lmao. They&#039;ve said they&#039;re going to sway away from the original ending with the OVA so when I heard they left on a note of ambiguity I got a bit of a hard on. But from the looks of it, they set up the good ending pretty well so don&#039;t know what to expect now.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion, Persona typically does its characters really well -- formulating them in such a way that makes them more human than just characters playing their part in a story. However in P5A, they&#039;re... well gee, they not done very well lads.<br />
<br />
Ren (the protagonist) comes off initially as this angsty, edgy and depressed teen, and with such dialogue options from the game as &quot;Please look after me&quot; and &quot;Hell yeah I&#039;m into older women&quot;, you kind of desire that silly aspect of the character especially when they did it with Yu in the P4 anime. Of course, Ren as a character is up to interpretation so I can&#039;t really say it&#039;s &quot;wrong&quot;. The other characters though, well yes I can.<br />
<br />
Sojiro feels so monotone and boring. The first couple of moments in the game set him up as a character who doesn&#039;t want to bother with your shit effectively helping to establish one of the best character development arcs in the story. He just sort of feels &#039;there&#039; in the anime, to progress the story when we need him to. Ryuji was fine until his rushed awakening and overreaction to Ren&#039;s story. There&#039;s something about him but I cannot put my finger on it just yet. Morgana is there, Igor looks dumb, Mishima didn&#039;t get hit by a ball, and I can finally understand why Shiho wanted to jump.<br />
<br />
Ann is definitely the worst change though. Ann&#039;s whole arc was supposed to be about her feelings towards objectification and slowly acknowledging herself as an attractive individual, using that fact for good. But what happens the episode after she goes on her whole &quot;don&#039;t objectify me&quot; spiel? They objectify her. :clap: :clap: Constant fanservicey shots, close ups of the icky unmentionables, you name it.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
<br />
This show has been making me very sad and I&#039;m not entirely hopeful for Dark Sun. There&#039;s nothing much more to say except that I hope Atlus start giving their properties back to competent studios. Tune in next time for when I show you how to hack into the Pentagon using only Futaba&#039;s social link.

    I immediately say that, I have not played the game, because I have only a PC and no consoles, but in good time back I already heard the sea a good comment about this game, most said that the game is worth it and the time went so fast that an animation about this game was already appearing and I decided to start watching this piece of work..... ok lets start with&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-OP intro- 9/10- impressive and interesting created, I really liked it.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10- For the moment everything is fine except for the main storyline- he has not yet appeared (although it was shown whose one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281018">
        of the main hero is in the interrogation room and he tells for some organization a story about own life= That could be fragment of the main story) but our heroes have enough working side missions so I can not understand what will happen next, for the moment I am satisfied with everything, YES there are things I would like to ask a question but I think the answers I will receive soon.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10- I even like this kind of drawing, though the legs seem a little too long, but it satisfies me.... the fighting episodes could have been much better, because at the moment it looks like 5/10 but overall 7/10 I hope that in further episodes it will improve.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10- I&#039;ve seen console gameplay in youtube and the sounds are taken from the game and music could also be.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10- To date, there is too little information about each of the main characters for the moment I like just two of them (Morgana and Amamiya Ren) 24 episodes uhhhhhh..... I hope that it will be enough time to tell more about each other.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10- I watched 6 episodes in 2 days, for the moment I feel good.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10- I have not played the game but I like- Persona 5 the Animation<br />
<br />
Bonus- Maybe sometime in the future, I will buy a console and will play this masterpiece.

    It&#039;s no secret that adaptations from video games tend to suck. Which is understandable due to it being difficult to cram so much storytelling into another form of media and condense it. There is also the fact that they bring the problems of the video game and try to adapt it into another form of media with those problems. Some examples include the adaptation of characters, their backstories, personalities and glossing over key plot points, believing that the viewer or reader already knows the details. <br />
<br />
Now I&#039;ve always admired the Persona games as an outsider since I have never played the games. So this was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290385">
        a chance to inspect the story of a Persona game through the ease of use of watching it in anime form. But instead of judging and comparing it to the Persona game, I will judge it on its own merits and see how good it is as an anime and how it has been translated while still acknowledging it is an adaption. Spoiler alert, it didn&#039;t do well. <br />
<br />
Sit back, relax and google what the f**k a Persona is as I present to the anime review for Persona 5: The Animation. Lets begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
The story begins with our main protagonist Ren Amamiya leaping around and trying to escape a casino until he is stopped and captured by the authorities. From there, someone comes into the interrogation room. An investigator by the name of Sae Niijuma tells Ren that she is willing to help Ren plead not guilty if he tells her everything about the Phantom thieves and their actions. The Phantom thieves are a vigilante group that steals peoples&#039; &quot;hearts&quot; to confess their sins to everyone that they have wronged. From there we see the events that have led to this moment and get acquainted to the Phantom thieves, their motivations and their desired goals to see justice against horrible people. <br />
<br />
The shows story structure is very formulaic. The phantom thieves encounter a very horrible person, get closer to them, change their heart, add a new recruit to the phantom thieves and move on to a bigger target. Every. Single. Time. There is some downtime between these in order to get attached to our characters more, which is good. Having downtime between these helps balance the pace out so we are not just going around in circles. But it doesn&#039;t change the fact that these castle raids to change peoples&#039; hearts are boring to watch over and over again with only slight deviation. Not only do you know what is going to happen, but there is little variation between them on how it is structured. <br />
<br />
And while I say the pace is balanced, it is also unbalanced as these castle raids have so many cutaways that it makes it all feel rushed and we don&#039;t get concrete buildup to it all when they encounter the final boss of the area. Context is key here as it helps flesh out the story and characters, but rushing to the important bits leaves the impression that nothing else is important other than this scene that we are trying to get to in order to show you this cool scene. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
<br />
Man, Ren is such a boring and bland character. I know portraying silent protagonists is hard but their personalities are driven by their actions and by you, the player. But translating that into an anime is very difficult. Instead, Ren resorts to being a near silent protagonist. The problem is that being a near silent protagonist, you are relying on your actions to speak for you, which is something the this show doesn&#039;t do. Ren does nothing interesting outside of the Phantom Thieves to expand and personalise his character. Too many times the anime cuts the meat off the side activities to help expand Ren&#039;s character. This leaves a main protagonist mind you, with no personality whatsoever as he merely just agrees and nods to other characters. <br />
<br />
Now does the rest of the cast share this same problem? Wellllll, not really. Individually, they do have their own personality traits to make them interesting but they are much better when they are together and these multiple personalities integrate with one another. They also get expanded upon in an episode dedicated to them to develop them more, which is something that Ren doesn&#039;t get unfortunately. The entire Phantom Thieves group hides Ren&#039;s lack of a personality by having multiple different personalities in the group work together to achieve the same goal. There individual personalities though. While they are better than Ren&#039;s personality (which isn&#039;t saying much), they do start to become a bit stale and boring. As well as some of the characters personality traits start to blend into one another as the show goes on. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 5.5/10<br />
<br />
Well it certainly captures the Persona style but in execution, it does fall flat. It feels like there were many cutbacks and so the overall animation quality has dropped from what I was expecting. Too many cutaways affected the fight scenes to make them feel lackluster and not capture the overall feel of watching these awesome moves be portrayed effectively. Instead, they just feel like they don&#039;t have as much of an impact as they should. This is especially true in the finishing manoeuvre sequence as it really feels lackluster. On the bright side though, the art style is rock solid and really does capture the Persona series which thank god it does because Persona is styled like an anime after all. There is also a good amount of CGI used in this show as well and while I don&#039;t think it looks horrible, it isn&#039;t great looking either; it&#039;s just okay. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10 <br />
<br />
Sound is the one area I have little to no complaints about. The OST has a very cool style to it and it really does stand out. From calm, collective soundtracks, to alert soundtracks to battle soundtracks. Each of them is distinct from one another and I can immediately recognise which one is playing at that moment. So at least this part of the anime is solid. <br />
<br />
Likewise the openings do help set a tone and are enjoyable to listen to. Both opening 1, &quot;BREAK IN TO BREAK OUT&quot; by Lyn and opening 2, &quot;Dark Sun...&quot; by Lyn as well are probably where the animation style actually shines and is well choreographed. While Dark sun took a little bit to get going for me, it is still enjoyable to watch and listen to. But Break in to Break out, for me, is the better of the two due to not having scenes ripped straight from the episodes before hand and the song being more fun to listen to due to its better build up towards the chorus. <br />
<br />
The endings, while also having good songs to listen to, is hampered down by simple animation as all it features is the cast just walking side by side, looking ahead of them, doing nothing else. I mean I know that it is meant to calm the viewer after watching the episode but it is boring to watch. But I still watched them because the songs were enjoyable to listen to. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
For me, Persona 5: the animation feels like a half assed attempt to adapt the game into an anime. Everything feels rushed as to say this is a summary of what the story is. For someone that has not played Persona 5 like myself, that&#039;s disappointing. I wanted an alternative to experience the Persona 5 story and characters, not a cheap way to make an anime while Persona 5 is still somewhat relevant before it gets swarmed by other big name games. It is a disappointment to me and I imagine many others and is a poor adaptation of an otherwise fantastic game. Unless you never played Persona 5 and you are really curious or a diehard Persona fan, you can skip this one. <br />
<br />
<br />
My Personal Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
<br />
Overall score: 5.7/10  Recommendation: Don&#039;t Bother<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m not going to waste my time with the introduction piece of the review so I&#039;m just going to start with the review.<br />
<br />
The story follows Ren Amamiya who is sent to Tokyo to stay with family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must &quot;rehabilitate&quot; to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads the protagonist into the Metaverse and from there him along with his group of friends that he recruits must now steal corruption from the hearts of adults

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301193">
        in an attempt to reform the city under a group called the Phantom Thieves.<br />
<br />
Persona 5 the Animation is a 26 episode anime and yep alarm bells should be ringing. We haven&#039;t got a great record of Video Game Adaptations especially as of late with the lacklustre Danganronpa animes. However, I went into Persona 5 The  Animation with an open mind because I thought that maybe this video game adaptation would work. It had director Masashi Ishihama who previously directed the critically acclaimed Shinsekai Yori. Plus the daybreak&#039;s OVA for Persona 5 was pretty good. I was actually excited.<br />
<br />
However, my excitement was immediately thrown out the window when I saw A1 Pictures. For those who haven&#039;t caught on, I hate A1 Pictures. I hate the studio with passion. I honestly believe that A1 Pictures is the most incompetent studio I have ever seen. Yes A1 did make some good shows that I really liked like The Idolm@sters, Magi, Shinekai Yori, Your Lie in April and Wotaku but the problem with A1 is that they made a truckload of mediocre, forgettable and terrible shows to a point where a lot of these bad shows seemed to represent A1 as a whole leaving a lot of good shows in the dust.<br />
<br />
I also don&#039;t want to speak about video games adaptations done by A1 Pictures because I heard nothing but awful things about them.<br />
<br />
I know that A1 Pictures did the Daybreak&#039;s ova back in 2016 and it was pretty solid but I never expected A1 Pictures to pass the TV series to Cloverworks aka A1&#039;s sub-studio until the studio split they own ways in October 2018.<br />
<br />
However, this show was released before A1 and Cloverworks went they own meaning this series despite being done by Cloverworks it still had that nasty A1 stench that I hated.<br />
<br />
Am not going to pull any punches with this one the story was awful and here&#039;s why.<br />
<br />
To start off with the elephant of the room is the pacing. Good god the pacing. Not going to lie this has got to be some of the worst pacings I have ever seen in anime because not only the show is ridiculously inconstant with it&#039;s pacing as it either way too slow or way too fast but it also screws up the overall narrative as well the emotional story elements.<br />
<br />
For example, in the game, Shino attempts suicide being raped by Kamoshida. It was an emotional moment in the early game of Persona 5 that was meant to showcase how screwed up the adults in the universe of Persona 5. It also gave Ann, Ryuji and Akira the motivation to act against Kamoshida.<br />
In the anime, it just happens in fin air. No tension, no proper build up whatsoever, nothing.<br />
This doesn&#039;t end where the show also outright skip various story elements that were meant to develop the characters. Even if you haven&#039;t played the games you can easily tell that the show is skipping and rushing many story aspects and as a result of that many of the story elements just feel awkward disjointed and forced.<br />
<br />
As a fan of the games, I felt insulted of how the show completely butchers and ruins everything that made the game so great in the first. Let&#039;s not talk about the social life aspects of the series because they do not exist. The biggest mistake of Persona 5 the Animation was how it adapted to a story that needed at least 51 episodes compared to 26 episodes that it actually got<br />
<br />
The final nail of the coffin was the ending. That ending alone was a big middle finger to the viewer as the show just ends in a very crappy way that feels unsatisfying as hell. I am aware that the series is getting an ova sometime soon but this is no excuse especially when we watched 26 of this rushed, awkward and poorly animated shit show that barely respects its source material.<br />
By the way, the Dark Sun OVA is not much better.<br />
<br />
The characters in Persona 5 are just lifeless husks of the game counterparts. Not only the character development is rushed beyond belief but they somehow made theses once interesting, well written and likeable characters and turned them into bland stereotypes. To save myself the misery and pain I will be ending the character selection of the review because if the show can even respect its characters than why should I.<br />
<br />
Now if thought the story and characters in Persona 5 The Animation were bad enough you ain&#039;t seen nothing yet because this is where the show officially hits rock bottom.<br />
Where the hell does I begin with this dumpster fire.<br />
First up the art style compared to the game looks like it was fished out of the toilet. Not only the show looks unappealing as well with its shitty background scenery, horrible lightning and uninspired character designs that look like the came out in early 2000 of anime but the art inconstantly is busted beyond belief where throughout the 26 episodes characters would constantly go off the model. <br />
<br />
The animation is even worse. I have never seen animation this lazy and lifeless since Black Clover and The Kings Game.<br />
Almost every single scene and fights in this show are all horrendously animated to the absolute core.<br />
Also, we don&#039;t speak about the shows horrendous attempt of using CGI. Good God was it awful to look at.<br />
The final nail of the coffin of this shit show was the all-out attacks which are frankly some of the worst pieces of animation I have ever seen in any anime. Every single all-out attack in this show feels like it was animated by college drop out who barely know anything about style when making this sequence in Adobe After Effects.<br />
Not even the beautiful fan-service scenes can save this shitty production.<br />
<br />
If there was anything good to come out of Persona 5 The Animation it would be the soundtrack. Despite the soundtrack being straight up taken from the game, it was still a great listen.<br />
The first opening theme BREAK IN TO BREAK OUT&quot; by Lyn is a fantastic opening theme for the show. While it was nowhere near as awesome as Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out its still a great song that perfectly captures the style of the series.<br />
The second opening theme Dark Sun by Lyn is a pretty solid opening theme in its own right however until the final episode I didn&#039;t like the fact that they reused footage from previous episodes into the opening visuals. However, the opening visuals for the last episode were awesome as it really showed off what the show could have been production values-wise.<br />
The ending themes were good but not that memorable.<br />
<br />
The voice acting was pretty okay as well however I feel like the Seiyuus didn&#039;t put much effort compared to the game counterpart. There is no English Dub for this show from the time of this review so if you&#039;re a fan of the Persona 5 dub well you&#039;re out of luck.<br />
<br />
Persona 5 The Animation is a total waste of time and effort. I honestly don&#039;t know what the hell was the director and Cloverworks were thinking during the production because they took everything that made Persona 5 so awesome and manages it screw it all up. The story is a rushed and poorly directed mess that is filled with horrific pacing that barely tells of what is going on. The characters are nothing but empty shells of the game counterparts and the visuals were horrendous beyond belief. The only good thing to come out from this scrapheap of a show was the music and the openings.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t played Persona 5 and have a PS3/PS4 do your self a favour. Go buy it right now. If you don&#039;t have a PS4 or PS3 you can either save up for one or watch other anime with the same episode length like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Nichijou Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Honestly out of all the game anime adaptations why is it Inazuma Eleven and Gungrave were the only one to get it right while others like Persona and Ace Attorney have to suffer. Such a shame.<br />
Cloverworks you may now be separated by the EA of anime studios A1 Pictures but you better redeem yourselves in future anime projects because you now have a lot of potential to be a competent studio. Don&#039;t let me down Cloverworks.

    Persona 5 was one of the best RPGS I&#039;ve ever played in my life, sensational gameplay the story is very good, have very few holes and plot twists sensational.<br />
The characters are great super well developed, as long as the player has an interest in socializing with a certain character.<br />
Already in the adaptation made by CloverWorks was different, first of all in the adaptation they decided to adapt 26 episodes until near the end of the game, which would be about 80 hours of history inside the game, of course it was very rushado, the problem is that Person 5 is a slow game that has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290550">
        the essence of making your own lifestyle within Tokyo with your own choices in the course of the game, taking that essence and accelerating the pace ends up leaving the feeling of everything being very superficial, whether in the relationship of the characters , at work, at school, in dungeons when he has fights, even in striking moments he can not deepen the scene in which the original had, was much worse. They did not know to take advantage of the characters of the game that can make you more curious about the history of each one and wanting to sympathize more and more, already in the adaptation they left very superficial the characters even more in their interaction with the protagonist, you simply do not care about they. The dramatic scenes and even the comedy scenes did not look good on the adaptation, without any impact, totally superficial, they just happen without a good break.<br />
<br />
<br />
The production was a fiasco, mainly in the fights, they could not pass the style of the fights that have in the game, outside that they tried to recreate the style of &quot;All out Attack&quot; that is one of the most stylish things of the game and was ridiculous,<br />
they failed to get a sense of epic battles against the bosses, they used almost no perk within the battles, and they changed certain<br />
ost of certain battles that got horrible. In the quieter parts he had many times that unnecessarily bent the design of the characters, besides the color palettes that did not use well. The dubbing is the same as it is very good. The ost used the same of the game that is sensational, and some new ones that were very good, but they were not always able to combine certain osts with the storyboard, in general it was mediocre.<br />
<br />
He had some cool things, like a better situation in the game that got a little superficial, usually in moments with minor characters in certain scenes, but in general it lacked a lot of character to stand out or receive a better polish inside the story, it was only played for say that there is that character inside that world that is something that the game does not do and has every reason for the character is present in that world.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Sometimes it is very cool to follow without commitment and without worrying about the details, after all I like a lot when it involves anything of persona 5, but Persona 5 is much more than that.<br />
If you are looking for a good experience with the story and the characters and especially the fights, play the game, that anime is just a small attempt to do marketing with the game that fails miserably.

    Persona 5 the Animation stole my heart!<br />
<br />
Adaptions of video games to other mediums always present problems, and Persona 5 the Animation is no different. Taking inspiration from such an expansive game and condensing it makes the pacing of the show a little wonky, but overall it does a good job covering what transpires over the game.<br />
<br />
The weakest point of this series is the art itself and frankly, it&#039;s just shite. Nothing looks good in motion, along with a lack of overall detail. The voice acting is the complete opposite, with the game VA&#039;s giving great performances that really add to the show.<br />
<br />
Overall this is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392721">
        relatively solid adaptation of Persona 5, minus the terrible art and weird creepy fan service. Major bonus points for including the best waifu/most beautiful girl Sae &lt;3 and thankfully, the worst girl Kasumi (yuck) is not in this rendition.<br />
<br />
8/10

    Persona 5 is probably my favourite game of all time. Over 100 hours it tells a story about rebellion, corruption, suicide and a talking cat magically turning into a bus. It truly is a one of a kind experience. And that’s the entire problem with this anime. It truly has no purpose for existence. Besides people who are too lazy to spend 100 hours on a game. <br />
<br />
The story follows main character Ren Amamiya, a teenager forced to move to Tokyo after he was wrongfully convicted of assault. Who discovers the cognitive world, where distorted desires materialise. And must team up with fellow outcasts to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336248">
        become the Phantom Thieves. A group dedicated to stealing those desires, causing a change of heart in even the most callous of criminals. <br />
<br />
The original managed to steal my heart within the first few hours, before we even started with the first palace. After the first three hours of this anime, we were already past the second palace. And that is the main problem here. The game took its time with the story. Taking the time to properly explore who these people are. The anime though has a lighting fast pace to it. Often skipping past entire palaces to get to the boss fight. Causing each palace to feel small compared to their in game counterpart. <br />
<br />
Characters pale compared to the game’s version. Great characters like Takemi, Kawakami and Chiya have their roles greatly reduced. All with the exception of Goro Akechi who is surprisingly, actually portrayed better here than in the game. <br />
<br />
The animation is terrible. When people prefer the cutscenes from a game that was released on the ps3. You know you have a problem. <br />
<br />
Overall Persona 5 The Animation is not only bad. It is shows that even the best stories can be told poorly.

    For a game that&#039;s about &quot;stealing your heart&quot;, Persona 5: The Animation on the other hand was nowhere close to capture LA&#039;s heart...<br />
<br />
LA only recently gotten into Persona 4: The Animation LA was hyped about Persona 5 as LA didn&#039;t play the game, so the anime was a good look into Persona 5, however...<br />
<br />
Persona 5: The Animation on the basis tries to relive the events of the game, truncating any of the minor events, and with that LA will at least say that trying to cram in a 90 to 120 hour game into a 26 episode anime IS gonna have these kind of limitations,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290411">
        but for what it&#039;s worth, Persona 5 did ok if a bit rushed in some of it&#039;s arcs. Persona 5: The Animation is inflicted with the video game curse in some sense but not in the way you&#039;d think.<br />
<br />
Persona 5&#039;s plot revolves around the &quot;Phantom Thieves&quot; a group who is able to change the hearts of people and is led by Akira Kur- Ren Amamiya  voiced by Jun Fukuyama, the &quot;Joker&quot;, but as they continue to gather more members, a bigger plot is brewing that leads Ren to being captured by the police and where the narrative structure of Ren retelling his adventures of changing people&#039;s hearts comes into play. Now the narrative structure is fine in some ways, a sorta in media res of Ren retelling his events to Sae Nijima, the detective questioning Ren all throughout the anime and the framing of how Ren got to where he is now is intriguing as well how he built up the Phantom Thieves and the members as well.<br />
<br />
Persona 5&#039;s characters are also immensely interesting to say the least, Ren has some personality to back him up though not the same as Yu from Persona 4 but nonetheless that and Persona 5 compared to Persona 4 have different levels of seriousness and playfulness in store. Due to Persona 5 going through many of the character arcs of the main cast (mainly the Phantom Thieves of course) we do get to see the Phantom Thieves develop through their issues or dilemma mostly through defeating the person or entity that troubles them in the &quot;villains palaces&quot; as a result. With that being said, LA was massively torn between two characters as LA&#039;s favorite character...either Makoto Nijima voiced by Rina Satou, the student council president and her views on &quot;justice&quot; tested during her arc (AND she&#039;s a badass) and Futaba Sakura voiced by Aoi Yuuki, a hikkimori who has a rather tragic backstory involving her mother and LA could relate to her in some sense due to this. LA&#039;s runner up was Ann Takamaki voiced by Nana Mizuki but nonetheless with the anime focusing alot on it&#039;s characters and their growth and arcs, made the main cast of the Phantom Thieves likable and memorable in a ways.<br />
<br />
Persona 5: The Animation&#039;s plot as LA aforementioned is was rushed and this was from a person who didn&#039;t play the games, each of the character arcs and &quot;palaces&quot; did have some decent screentime, but not alot of downtime much like Persona 4 and how they dealt with their dungeons, we at best get montages of the Phantom thieves traversing through the palaces, but in terms of battles, it&#039;s mostly one mob or monster then goes straight into the boss in question one or two episodes later. All LA means by &quot;no downtime&quot;, is that the Phantom thieves doesn&#039;t have some breathing room in between palaces, though in some defence to this, Yuusuke Kitagawa voiced by Tomokazu Sugita and Makoto Nijima got &quot;some&quot; breathing room in between but still, it was rushed to say the least and this was even with a 26 episode timeframe!<br />
<br />
So if the characters were done well and the plot&#039;s structure had some rushed pacing, what really crippled it?, yeah...the animation is a bit subpar alot of the time. The animation studio CloverWorks round the halfway point, you could easily tell the derpy faces as well as cutting corners ALOT and it just gradually keeps showing up in the later episodes, sure the animation had some sense of detail in it&#039;s palaces and it&#039;s character designs being visually striking but for the animation to dip and not fully recover by the end of it was disappointing to say the least. The animation was subpar and was probably the biggest detriment to the anime overall.<br />
<br />
With that Persona 5: The Animation had a major problems but it&#039;s small little details that ruined Persona 5: The Animation from being in the same league as something like Persona 4 and LA loved that adaptation. Look, to most of the detractors of Persona 5: The Animation, you just can&#039;t cram a 120 hour game into a 26 episode runtime, there is BOUND to be some truncations, BUT for first timers who haven&#039;t played the game, it&#039;s actually a decent look into the game, with the story being structurally sound besides some pacing issues, characters who are memorable and develop them as the anime goes along BUT where Persona 5: The Animation falls flat is it&#039;s animation and that is just something LA can&#039;t ignore.<br />
<br />
Persona 5: The Animation you got some problems but your fine as an adaptation, being by the book in adapting the plot of the game well, but where the video game curse comes in is not having a convoluted stories and superfluous characters and the such but for what a simple thing as not having the drive in making the animation as great as could be as well as occasional rushed pacing, LA WANTED to love ya but by the end of watching it all, all LA felt was a dull thud in what could had been a great adaptation rivaling Persona 4: The Animation, yes LA was disappointed by this adaptation but not outright hate it as it had some strengths to it but nonetheless...<br />
<br />
Persona 5: The Animation your not misguided just mismanaged...

    This anime is just disappointing, the only redeeming features are its dub and the score. Aside from that do not waste your time with it. Anything good you could possibly take from this is probably on a p5a funny moments complimation on youtube.<br />
<br />
The portrayal of the story is rushed in many ways and the ending is just disgusting, setting everything up of the for the true ending and it just ends with ketchup walking away.<br />
<br />
Character writing is sometimes amazing but mostly just bad. The best being Ryuji saying yeet while throwing morgana.<br />
<br />
The sound track is good but like, its persona how bad can it be?<br />
<br />
Overall,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382883">

    {Spoilers}<br />
I had higher hopes. I played the game so I know the storyline already, but when I watched the anime it was boring and messy. If you want a better story, you should just watch the gameplay.<br />
<br />
{Story 8/10}<br />
I gave story 8/10 not because of the anime but because of the idea. Sadly the anime didn&#039;t portray it well and had many scenes were I just got bored and stopped. <br />
<br />
{Art 4/10}<br />
Horrible art, messy and bad, and in each episode there are probably 20 pictures were the characters look stupid and deformed. I hoped they would use the anime scenes from the game and use them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296030">
        for the same events in the anime but they decided to redraw them instead and make it look 20x worse. (I know there are probably copyright issues)<br />
<br />
{Sound 8/10}<br />
The voice actors are fine, they sound similar enough to the game, and had e same amazing music that I love in persona.<br />
<br />
{Character 9/10}<br />
I love the characters! Amazing Amazing Amazing characters, except for the art. I love futaba and Ann, and Main Protagonist, but It&#039;s not really related to the anime seeing that its just characters from the game.<br />
<br />
{Enjoyment 5/10}<br />
Like I said before, there are many times I got bored and watched a different anime. There are scenes that just go on and on and they go through palaces way to quickly.<br />
<br />
{Overall 6/10}<br />
The anime had cute scenes but overall it sucked. Watch/play the game, don&#039;t watch the anime unless you want to make an AMV. :3

    Now to start this off, Persona 5 is a video game and everyone should know this. A 100+ hour video game. Persona 5 is actually my third favorite video game of all time and I have over 200+ hours in it. Anyway, a game like this CAN&#039;T be condensed into anime that is a total of 8.6 hours. It&#039;s impossible to even try to do that. This will probably be one of the first and only reviews I ever do but I think it just needs to be said that this anime isn&#039;t good, but the game is amazing so definitely go play that. Ok

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353116">
        time to start the actual review now haha...<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
Now Persona 5&#039;s story is pretty good on its own. I think you can see a bunch of things leading up to the big twists but that&#039;s beside the point. Now that was the game now let&#039;s talk about the anime. The anime misses a bunch of stuff, like almost everything except the main details and sometimes they even miss thoughts. A clear example is episode 3 where Suzui jumps off the school roof, this is lead up by nothing. They just threw it at us with no building up to it. Again the story can&#039;t be condensed into 8.6 hours.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The art is just comical at this point. A bunch of frames is just so bad and in general its just really bad. I think the biggest example is the all-out attack in episode 2. It&#039;s just abnormally bad and people say that it would have been better to just copy and paste the all-out attack from the game then use the anime style version. I will give it the benefit of the doubt that for 70% of the anime, it&#039;s drawn pretty ok, but for the rest of its garbage. Even the cutscenes in the game are drawn better than the anime.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
I think this might actually be the best thing in this entire anime. Again it&#039;s still not good. The Persona 5 OST is a masterpiece, almost every single song from the game track is amazing and it&#039;s great to listen too. The anime again is very short, they don&#039;t even play every single song from the game. There&#039;s not much to say about it though.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
The cast for Persona 5 is great and I find it the worst thing in the anime. The entire point(or one of them at least) in the Persona series is to build up and grow your confidants, in other words, your friends, deepen the bond with them. Now when you take that aspect away from you only have the story and gameplay, AND take the gameplay away and you have a mediocre story. Anyway, Persona 5 takes away any type of character development any of the characters could have because it takes time for all of them to grow. My favorite character is Goro Akechi and even he is extremely lacking in this anime. Again they take all of the things away that make the characters likable, their development. All that time is taken away with you hanging out with them. I can&#039;t blame them because even though they did make the anime, they can&#039;t show everything in such little time. Definitely the worse thing about the anime though by far.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
I can enjoy this very little from everything that I just stated. I cringed at some of the bad art. Again it&#039;s just a poor anime and it really shows how some games just can&#039;t be animes unless its extremely long.<br />
<br />
ok just go please play Persona 5 on ps4 thanks<br />
<br />
<br />

    (First of all, I&#039;m brazillian then sorry about any grammar mistakes)Persona 5 the animation is a anime series based on a game with the same name, first released in 2018 and finishing airing in 2019. I&#039;ve got to say with all my sincerity that Persona 5 is one of the worst and most disappointing anime shows that I ever witnessed with my bare eyes. I had some friends who enjoyed this... thing and I couldn&#039;t understand why. On this review I&#039;ll be mostly talking about why this series is so disappointing in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Story(7/10):The story is the major quality of the animation. Not gonna lie,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345685">
        the whole concept of breaking into pallaces and steal souls is very unique and interesting, but this is not a compliment. Try to compact about 100+ hours of gameplay in 26 episodes is a very bad idea, because there was a lot of misused concepts(especially Personas) and lots of very rushed scenes. Now you may be thinking:&quot;they needed to adapt a story in just 26 episodes, of course it would be dificult and have some mistakes&quot;, well if that&#039;s the case SHOULDN&#039;T YOU JUST LIKE NOT MAKE AN ANIME ADAPTATION? Persona 5 story is interesting, but if you want to enjoy the best of it, please buy the game. it&#039;s more worth of your time.<br />
<br />
Art(2/10) and sound(7/10):Where should I start? If you just saw the art style or some promotional art, you probably thought:&quot;wow the art is just like the game! This can&#039;t be bad right?&quot;, and I&#039;m really sorry for you. The art style is very good actually and pretty faithful to the game, but on the other hand the animation... For starters, Persona 5 has the POOREST animation that I&#039;ve ever seen, the characters moved like some kind of cheap animatronics, and the animators didn&#039;t even care to at least make facial expressions that actually expressed something. Someone is angry? Is he sad? We can only know with the voice acting, otherwise they would be just a group of Bellas from &quot;Twilight&quot;. One of the coolest things in the game were the fights, that are garbage in the anime. being basically pokemon fights, where they just keep shooting each other until someone dies.There was also the &quot;in-all attacks&quot;, that looked like complete trash. I&#039;m also not in the mood to talk about their horrible CGI. Now about the sound, it would be total shame if it wasn&#039;t their voice actors. Besides the cast&#039;s robotic movements and blank faces, what gave them life was the voice, the dubbing was just too good and they matched perfectly with each character. The musics used on the anime were made by the game&#039;s lead composer:Shoji Meguro, and they were pretty damn good, but sometimes they didn&#039;t fit on the action scenes. On the other hand the sound effects were disgusting. They didn&#039;t match on what actions were happening, or they were just very poor. Some examples are the gunfire noises, they were ridiculous, mostly because they didn&#039;t resemble the sound of gunpowder exploding, somehow they resembled an airsoft gun shooting.<br />
<br />
Characters(1/10):The Persona characters were very cool, they were empathetic and interesting... sorry I&#039;m talking about the game. While our protagonist Amamiya Ren is stoic, he is not like Giorno from Jojo for example, he doesn&#039;t seem to have a deeper personality, he is just expressionless and nothing more. I dare to say that Ryuji is the only one that overall has a personality. The rest of the cast is just like Sword Art Online&#039;s cast, they are just there to keep the story going. I&#039;m giving a few positive points because they managed to make their designs faithful to the games(and overall because their designs are very good), but the main reason to my deception is how the anime cast are basically cardboard figures compared to their games counterpart. While Ryuji in the games is a stupid, but very kind,funny and sometimes a little perverted school delinquent, in the series he&#039;s just the dumb protagonist best friend. While Ann in the game showed how she felt guilt for not helping her best friend Shiho, eventually evolving and defeating her insecurity, in the anime she felt sad for her friend... yeah nothing more happens. While Yusuke in the game is a very passionate person for art,always wanting to illustrate what he sees, and a very dense person, being unable to read the mood, which creates very funny scenes, in the anime he simply doesn&#039;t have a personality.<br />
-PERSONAS-<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about the main mechanic in the games:Personas. Even if in the game the Personas were only used in attacking purposes, like in the anime, was it really clever to make things like this way? When someone summons their Persona, they just shoot a beam of light and disappear, eventually there were some different and more interesting powers, but they were always used in the same way (except in one scene where Yusuke&#039;s Persona uses a ice beam to freeze an enemy to the ground). What I wanted to see then? Let&#039;s use as an example another anime with a similar mechanic:Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure and their Stands. Each stand is used in a smart and surpring way, just like Giorno&#039;s Gold Experience and it&#039;s ability of life-giver. If Gold Experience was used in Persona, his user would probably just create some animals, like wolves, and send them to attack the enemy. In Jojo, Giorno uses his Stand to overload an enemy with life energy, making his senses go berserk, transform an object(like a shoe or a teeth) into a fly to track its owner,heal injuries, create trees to reach higher levels, etc. See the difference? Jojo&#039;s Stands are used in creative ways, they aren&#039;t just weapons, while the Personas are used in a plain way, wasting their potential. Also, one thing that the anime do not explain, is why Ren always show up with different Personas. And I don&#039;t know why. Now if you don&#039;t know, the reason why is a basic mechanic in the game:executing Personas to create a new one, and the capturing shadows to get a new Persona, but if someone don&#039;t know about that, it gets pretty confusing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(1/10) and overall(2/10):I needed to watch this anime after making a tract with a friend... I kind of regret that decision. The series have an interesting plot, but it is really wasted in the anime. The poor animation mixed with bad sound effects, a story that doesn&#039;t flow naturally and misused characters just make the experience of watching more and more painful. If you want a anime with a good plot, great characters, good looking visuals and animation,great sound in general and has &quot;Personas&quot; in it, just watch Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure:Diamond is Unbreakable, this is worth of your time. But if you do really want to know how Persona 5 is, play the game. Seriously, I&#039;ve started playing the game recently, but it is very obvious the difference beteween anime and game. Why would anyone watch 26 episodes of a poor version from a let&#039;s play, if playing the game itself you get to know the story better, the characters are really good, the gameplay is very fun and the animation is limited to cutscenes.<br />
<br />
Even without playing the game, i got really disappointed with the show, and after watching a few let&#039;s plays, I just couldn&#039;t believe that this game gave birth to the monstruocity that is this anime. I know that I said that a lot of times, but don&#039;t waste your time with this, it&#039;s not worth your time. People cried watching Anohana? Clannad after story? Your Lie In April? I cried watching this piece of ****.

    I can describe my feelings about this anime in one word: why?<br />
<br />
This anime is an anime adaptation of the award winning game Persona 5 (which is also one of my favourite games of all time). While Persona 5 is an amazing game, it’s also a very long game and the fact that this show is only 25 episodes long is the first thing that made me feel skeptical about this show before I watched it. After I watched it, it was a hell of a lot worse than I could’ve imagined. This anime is so damn ugly like Jesus Christ! Why do the characters look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341618">
        so damn stupid?! Why is the all out attack screen so empty and hideous! Jesus Christ this is bad. The one positive of this show is the music because it uses music from persona 5 along with some decent songs made just for this show, the best of which is the first ending: to infinity. <br />
<br />
The only reason I have some of the stuff 10s and stuff is because it’s Persona 5, not because this show is actually good at it.<br />
<br />
But the main sin (pun not intended) is that WHY ISNT FUTABA CONSIDERED A MAIN CHARACTER WHY ARE THEY A SUPPORTING CHARACTER?!

    Persona 5 was one of the best games that I have ever played, and was a hit both in Japan and in the West upon its release, and continues to gather attention with spin offs and possible sequels based upon the loveable characters the game presents you with, along with the fantastic music crafted by Shoji Meguro (which luckily makes its way into this animated adaption).<br />
<br />
It was a hard job to handle, cramming a 90-100 hour game into only 26 episodes, but as we have seen with Persona 4 the Animation (also handled by A1 Pictures), it can be done well. <br />
<br />
But wherever the previous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306822">
        animated series succeeded, this series failed. Miserably.<br />
<br />
The pacing of the entire anime is laughable, with exposition being either crammed into a few short sentences or not even brought up at all until it is only just relevant. The fight scenes are animated very poorly, with the pace of the fights all over the place and the art itself mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
Due to the poor pacing, many story moments are rushed over, and some of the truly important moments for character development and plot are give to few time for us to sink in the information or even care about the story it is presenting.<br />
<br />
This anime left a bad taste in my mouth, and when i reached the end of it&#039;s 26 episode run (along with two OVA episodes to complete the story in a rushed manner), i felt as though another trip through the PS4 title was needed to experience the story the way it was meant to be done.

    just play persona 5 its a 10/10 game<br />
 they somehow managed to ruin everything good about p5<br />
story 4/10: the story fells rushed  wierd pacing and they somehow ruined the main storyline of the game cause off course a 100+ hours game wont fit in a 24 ep show so they cut alot of corners<br />
character 4/10: well they decided to  cut almost all of the characters personality and development so they are all  deep like the dead sea <br />
sound 7/10: the game sound truck is good but used incorrectly in a way that makes the scene fell weird  and the new trucks

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285198">
        are bad<br />
Art: 3/10<br />
Action scenes are where the series looks the worst. It constantly uses this laughable shortcut of zooming in and out on unanimated shots to reuse them at a different resolution in a later scene. There’s somehow less animation than the game, and what we see tends to be worse. Look no further than the ‘epic’ boss battle in episode 5, what should have been amazing was stilted by hideous CGI that looked even worse than what was used in the game. The action is so boring to watch too because there are next to no stakes, usually, the Phantom Thieves are fighting random mobs but even the boss goes down so quickly. <br />
<br />
The fight choreography is even worse, the whole battle scene where Ryuji awakens his persona is the worst case of it. There is next to no fight choreography at all, hits don&#039;t even feel like hits, it&#039;s more like colors flying around with sound effects added over it. And somehow the all all-out-attack is so much worse than the game’s even though it was practically ripped straight from it.<br />
<br />
Character designs are the best part of the visuals because they’re lifted straight from the game, but they only look good when they’re totally motionless or on an animation loop (very often). When there&#039;s not much movement and/or character close-ups look really good but by that logic, you should just play the game.<br />
<br />
There’s also plenty of ugly CGI random people walking in the background. In episode 2 Ren and his teacher are talking in a hallway, and there’s a giant CGI student trying desperately to walk without looking like a robot but its so obvious he was stuck on there last minute with zero quality control to fix him. He looks ridiculously unpolished and the perspective is all messed up, he goes past two girls standing near a door and he looks twice as large as them.<br />
enjoyment 1/10: how can u enjoy one of seeing one of the best games in the last 8 years getting gutted<br />
over all 3/10<br />

    TL;DR: Works better as a companion to the game, anime original scenes or changes from the game are generally pretty good but the rest can be seen as average in terms of writing. Art is mediocre overall but gets better too late. Enjoyable if a Persona fan, just don&#039;t expect P4A 2.0<br />
<br />
Persona 5 the Animation has been the subject of ridicule with the quality of the art and animation along with the rushing of a 100+ hour game into 26 episodes plus an unspecified amount of OVAs later on, and from this you would think that CloverWorks has somehow managed to make the worst anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291478">
        of the year. As someone who loved the game and somewhat enjoyed the anime, I disagree.<br />
<br />
Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The same as the game that&#039;s being adapted, a few changes to some major events that, in my mind, fix some areas of the game that I found a bit off (such as the existence of the betrayal being revealed in the first 15 minutes of the game and the Okumura arc). The rest of it is around or below average, especially near the beginning with the Kamoshida arc being horribly rushed, with a silver lining in that the writing seemed to improve as the series continued.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Below average for the most part, with some standouts in the final few episodes. Poor animation (particularly All-Out Attacks and the use of CG outside of bosses) and art are everywhere in this adaptation, so the less said the better. The second set of visuals for both OPs and the final few episodes stand out as good art from this adaptation.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The game&#039;s soundtrack with sometimes weird timings and mixing along with a few anime original tracks, both instrumentals and ones with Lyn again providing vocals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s where things get interesting. On one hand, Ren Amamiya is quite a boring character compared to the Joker of the game, particularly if you liked to pick the joke options, and is a huge let down to me after the P4 and P3 animes&#039; portrayals of their protagonists (he has a few moments but despite them there&#039;s no redeeming his writing). The other characters, however, get expanded upon and have anime original moments that are actually good. Goro Akechi&#039;s friendship/rivalry with Ren sees heavy expansion to the point that they can be considered as having a connection instead of one line and a confidant rank up like in the game. The entire party seems to interact with each other more too, like the anime&#039;s addition of Ann and Makoto&#039;s friendship after the Kaneshiro arc.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
It&#039;s good I guess. I feel as if you&#039;d have a much better time in watching this after completing the game as while the general quality of the series ranges from average to poor the new content, whether its original scenes or changes to the game&#039;s script, were generally the highlights of what could have been a massive dump on a great game
