    “This show is fucking awful.”<br />
-Me<br />
<br />
The rules of the King’s Game are as follows:<br />
1. All female characters must be disgustingly sexualized, this is a MATURE show for ADULTS after all.<br />
2. Every death has to be over-the-top and ridiculous, people like comedy relief, right?<br />
3. Characters must never exercise common sense, how else would there be a conflict?<br />
4. The plot must be as nonsensical as possible. We can just tell people it’s a “mystery.”<br />
<br />
Ousama Game is revolting. <br />
It’s not bad in a &quot;Wow this show has so much mindless violence,&quot; sort of way. <br />
It&#039;s more like &quot;Wow some perverted sicko was paid to animate their disgusting fetishes.”<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265831">
        only repulsed by Ousama game because of the sexualization. I&#039;m repulsed because of how it uses the horror genre as an excuse to create degenerate sexualized violence. <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
The story goes in circles, introducing a few characters that you have no reason to care about, they&#039;re killed violently in very stupid ways, then the cycle repeats in the next episode. <br />
<br />
A group of students of some random class receive text messages from a person who calls themselves “King” aka Ousama, they say the students are part of a game and if they don&#039;t obey the rules they will be punished. Seems interesting enough, right? And it kind of is until you realize every episode has the same structure; a bunch of random students are introduced, they receive a nearly impossible order from the king via their phones, they obviously fail to survive it and die in horrific ways. At least the deaths are pretty ridiculous, some of them are borderline hilarious. There was even a girl who gets punished by being burnt to death, which might have been scary if she hadn&#039;t just stood around for a whole minute entirely engulfed in flames. Out of all things she could&#039;ve done, she chose to take off her clothes. Yep. She is being burnt alive and the writer thought that was the perfect time for fanservice. Humanity is doomed, we&#039;re all going to hell, and Ousama Game will be the catalyst for the apocalypse.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the story is that the characters make the same stupid choices over and over. The protagonist Nobuaki has survived a King&#039;s Game before, and while the current game is happening he also tells us about the original game in flashbacks. We constantly see the characters make the same mistakes because all of the students, past or present are braindead. Studio Seven didn’t have enough material from the first manga for a full show, so to compensate they adapted the prequel story as well. The issue is, the author is a hack, so both mangas use the same plot devices. Layering both stories on top of each other caused the show to be so frustratingly repetitive, it made me want to tear my hair out. There is no consideration put into the series of events in King&#039;s Game, supernatural crap happens and people make inhumanly stupid decisions. Shocking events are contrived into existence and we’re just supposed to believe it. The only thing that keeps the show semi-comprehensive is the formulaic story; there is a group of random students and per rules of the death game genre they will all be killed until there’s a winner. At least Ousama Game has a basic plot structure making it not entirely incompetent, but that’s not to say it’s original whatsoever. Chances are the author grabbed a handful of concepts from popular anime to cobble together this story without caring how messy the final product would turn out. <br />
<br />
I like Ousama Game&#039;s concept of everyday people trying to fight against a personified Deus Ex Machina antagonist, but this idea is used, abused, then thrown into a dumpster and lit on fire. The King is never explored as an antagonist, it&#039;s just an excuse for mindless violence. The writer throws so many ideas at the wall but nothing sticks: He takes the cell phone gimmick from Mirai Nikki, he takes the unstoppable supernatural death from Another, and the abundance of gore from both, but it does nothing with them. For all the flaws those shows have, at least they know how to build up enough tension for gore to not be totally undeserved. Ousama Game just throws violence, blood, screaming, and fanservice at you in an attempt to be taken seriously. How ironic that the director of Mirai Nikki worked on the much better death game show this season, Juuni Taisen.<br />
<br />
The show is so obsessed with its own edginess that it’s laughable. We’re constantly reminded how evil humans are when put into a complex situation like the King’s Game. For example, a guy who hasn&#039;t even been given a name beats up another guy by order of the king and says “It’s kill or be killed!!” This scene doesn&#039;t add anything to the tone, and it just states the very obvious theme of death games. No one in the real world would act like these people. The characters are too unbelievable to seriously analyze the psychology behind the horrible things they do to each other.<br />
<br />
Characters: 0/10<br />
Yep. 0%<br />
The characters make the show ridiculous and impossible to take seriously. If they just didn’t exist the show would be 10 times better. Everything they do is stupid. They get themselves into terrible situations and endanger their lives and the lives of their classmates constantly, but as you start to realize there is no hope for any of their survival you will find that their stupidity makes the show comedic. They yell at each other and get nothing done. They constantly deny the King&#039;s Game is real, even though many of their classmates have already been killed; They just remark &quot;it must be a coincidence!&quot; and I chuckled every time I saw that line.<br />
<br />
The main character, Nobuaki, is an asshole. He’s built up to be some kind of hero. His classmates constantly act like he’s a saint who&#039;s helped them survive the game. Yet we only ever see him treat them like crap, but it&#039;s the girls who get it worse. He smacks them, he forces them to do degrading things, and he tricked a fucking blind girl after causing her to go blind. But even after all of the awful things they still sing his praises. Everything wrong with Nobuaki starts to make sense once you look at the staff page... The “Original Creator” is also named Nobuaki Kanazawa. Yes, the creator of this shit-fire placed himself into Ousama Game because it is HIS fantasy. I don&#039;t know who hurt this poor man, but I cannot fathom why he thought animating his sick fetishes would make for a good anime. At least this explains why all of the characters lose all sense of logic to praise him. This is just sad.<br />
<br />
The one character I could point out as the antagonist is Natsuko. Even if the king could be counted as a villain, they never make an appearance. What&#039;s so frustrating about her is that she is very clearly insane, but no one seems to care. She kills her classmates, manipulates them with sex, and swaps into her psychotic persona at the drop of a hat, yet none of the students think to say “Maybe we shouldn’t trust that crazy psycho bitch. She probably wants to kill all of us!” This issue is never resolved! Natsuko constantly tricks people throughout the show, and it gets laughably predictable when she fools her classmates. You can always tell when someone&#039;s about to die. An unsuspecting random student introduced just minutes ago is always destined to be killed by the end of the episode. They never get any development whatsoever, so there&#039;s no reason to care about them. No one involved in Osama Game cared at all about creating believable characters. Their main goal was to create big breasted anime ladies to fetishize, which isn’t surprising considering Studio Seven only makes hentai.<br />
<br />
Art: 1/10<br />
Flat and ugly visuals plague the show all around. The only scenes that seem to have been made with serious effort are the sex scenes, which is unsurprising considering the studio that produced it makes primarily hentai. Misshapen character designs make the show even worse to look at because the majority of scenes are them standing around talking (or yelling). Backgrounds range from mostly the school, character&#039;s homes, hospitals sometimes, but none of them are even a little nice to look at. The art becomes incredibly bad in the later episodes. Characters look laughably off-model constantly. Blood looks like thick globs of ketchup which only makes the show seem more like a comedy. All you people out there who watch crappy shows ironically will find something worth laughing at in this show’s visuals.<br />
<br />
Don’t expect the edginess to make up for the show&#039;s issues because the atmosphere is crap too. Horror anime like Another, Shiki, and Higurashi showed us that it’s possible to make a horror anime with a thick atmosphere to immerse the viewers. But on top of the terrible visuals, the idiotic characters, poor direction, and hilariously bad script make it impossible to get immersed in. <br />
<br />
Sound: 3/10<br />
The music and sound effects aren’t good, but sometimes they work to comedic effect. Sound effects like the ringing of the phones when the characters receive a message from the king are timed to be jump scares or spook the viewer, but they add significant humor to scenes due to very predictable outcomes. The soundtrack is very mediocre and it reminds me of the type of music from old campy horror flicks, I like that style but it doesn’t fit with the mature tone that they were aiming for. Extra camp is always a welcomed addition to a pile of crap like this. You can never have enough unintentional comedy when it comes to Ousama Game!<br />
<br />
As if the show didn’t have enough edge already, the OP is emo/metalcore. And it really is not the good type, just loud and obnoxious. You’d do well to skip over the OP (and the whole show honestly). The ED song &quot;Lost Paradise&quot; is pretty edgy too but it’s not harsh on the ears, it should have been used as the op in my opinion. It&#039;s no surprise the performer of the song Pile is mostly known for her work on the idol series Love Live because she&#039;s quite talented (talent that King&#039;s Game didn&#039;t deserve). There’s a dub too. God bless the writers at Funimation for taking on this heap of garbage because the translated script is hilariously bad. The voice acting is expectedly amateurish. It’s not much better than the sub.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get a little bit of enjoyment from Ousama Game. Not once did I feel close to being afraid while watching it, but I laughed many times. Actually, there was one time I technically was afraid of the show. At the very end of episode 12, there is the most terrifying line in the entire show.<br />
<br />
“To Be Continued.”<br />
<br />
Imagining there might be a sequel to this dumpster fire chills me to my core. <br />
<br />
Ousama Game is only semi-watchable when it’s showing off a slew of ridiculous deaths with really poor art quality because at least you can laugh at it. If that doesn’t sound like something you could enjoy then you’ll likely get nothing out of the show. Even if you intend to watch it for the overdone violence you’ll probably be disappointed because by the final few episodes it becomes toned down and more execution styles are reused. It can’t even do mindless violence right... Keep in mind though, the show never fully embraces the absurdity of its plot so the comedy doesn’t reach its full potential. The repulsive sexualization also prevents the comedy from being consistent. Whenever I thought it might get funny I was bombarded with unsettling fanservice that made my skin crawl, defusing any potential comedy.<br />
<br />
It’s almost always obvious when a character is about to die. They get a last-minute line to characterize them to make you feel sad. Needless to say, this cheap trick never worked. The deaths are never impactful in any way. <br />
<br />
Final Score: 1/10<br />
Ousama Game is broken, it is missing features that are necessary to tell a story. There’s no pacing, the director cares more about shooting the female characters in risque ways than actually telling a story, the actual story makes no sense and falls apart as soon as you think about it. Frustrating doesn&#039;t even begin to describe how I felt about the characters. They are stupid and will always be stupid, so don&#039;t go into it expecting a horror. I recommend only watching it as a comedy (if you really must watch it). I hate Ousama Game. If I could delete it from existence I wouldn’t hesitate to do so. Nobuaki too, he&#039;s up there with the worst protagonists I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime.

    Ok, im going to give you the quick rundown. <br />
The biggest problem with this anime is the way it executes a plot that is meant to be filled with dread and sadness. This is a survival anime where a bunch of peole go aginst eachother for survival more or less. <br />
In survival animes the writers are supposed to make you feel for the characters so that when theirs lives are at stake you really get nervous. The characters are supposed to have motives and personalities that are at least a little complex and unique. <br />
That way when they get pitted against each other the battle

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261763">
        that occurs, no matter physical or mindgames get interesting. <br />
<br />
This anime fails at all of that and just ends up becoming and edgy, fake-deep, dissapointment.

    Okay, I had to make an account just to write a review for this. The other reviews I read seemed to miss the mark, and in my opinion come from pretty naive point of views. <br />

To me the worst part of this show is the animation and the sound, but it certainly isn&#039;t as bad as what haoliners has given us. I find it to be pretty tolerable, and considering animators in Japan are known to be severely under paid, I can certainly forgive it and proceed forward into what other qualities the anime has to offer. But if this is critical to your enjoyment,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262520">
        I would keep this in mind before starting it.<br />
<br />
Okay so now that I&#039;ve cleared the air of that, I want to get to what I think this anime offers that I haven&#039;t really seen mentioned. I believe in another review I read that this was some sort of sick display of a perverted mind, which made me believe that this is the type of anime that will heavily divide its audiences enjoyment based on your world views and if you prefer anime primarily for its escapism or if you enjoy it because you like to see real life elements integrated and practiced out in a fictional world. I am of the latter of the two which may be why I enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
This show has so far absolutely thrown some heavy situations on you within a short amount of time. So far we&#039;ve dealt with making self sacrificial decisions for the better of someone you love, betrayal, difficult decisions made out of self preservation, false persona&#039;s shattered under tension, terrible life tragedies, and getting to watch a relatable protaganist desperately try to keep things together as it all falls apart in his hands. <br />
<br />
Obviously we don&#039;t have to deal with a mysterious omnipotent power commanding us to our deaths in reality, but we absolutely do have to deal with issues like sexual abuse, infidelity, loss, betrayal, true faces being shown under pressure, and other various situations this show has put on display for us. Personally, I enjoy watching the main character scramble as he tries to keep face in light of all these horrific challenges, because I find that to be absolutely relatable, and it makes me that much more interested in seeing what route they will take for the conclusion.<br />
 <br />
This show does an excellent job at keeping things on edge, as the viewer learns quickly that the characters lives can be quite short lived. This is both a strength and weakness this element of the story brings. On one hand it makes you value the characters lives when you become attached to certain ones, but in the same breath it doesn&#039;t really invest much into why you should be attached to them in the first place. But with that being said, I found myself getting strong feels when characters I hardly knew put on display of genuine relatable emotion, which i don&#039;t really see as a easy feat to accomplish.<br />
<br />
If your like me and you&#039;ve been watching anime for 15+ years, you might find this to be a refreshing breath of air. It surely isn&#039;t the most original anime, but it definitely isn&#039;t the typical, overly done recurring themes we&#039;ve seen in the industry lately.<br />
<br />
When recommending this to others I would give this anime a 7,  all though personally the number based off of my own enjoyment would be worthy of an 8. It&#039;s nothing profound or game changing, its just a good story to observe. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to anyone without a backbone that isn&#039;t looking to have challenging feelings thrown at them, since this is certainly one for a more mature audience with a taste for darker themes.<br />
<br />
At this point in time only 5 episodes of the series are out, so this series may very well crash and burn depending on the route they take, but i definitely recommend others to join this journey as of right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
**UPDATE** Just finished the series. All hopes I had were crushed. This took an absolute turn for the worst. Smh I just can&#039;t even believe how bad it got towards the end.  It had potential, but it was completely wasted.

    Down the anime rabbit hole I go.<br />
<br />
The King&#039;s Game is the worst anime I have ever seen.<br />
Am not kidding. The King&#039;s Game is the most terrible piece of shit I ever had sat through<br />
I honestly shocked at the anime director’s ability to blow all expectations of god-awful anime that are popping out from the rabbit hole.<br />
When I aware that was I say this is the worst anime I have seen that it comes with the expectations of this somehow being worse than the likes of Big Order, Handshakers, and Eromanga Sensei which before I saw this they were the worst animes I have ever seen.<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265826">
        had no interest in watching this show because I thought it’s one of those shitty novel adaptions that pop up in every anime season. The only reason why I ever decided to watch this show in the first place because a couple of my friends were watching it and they told it’s an another Mayoiga which was one of the best B movie type anime I have ever seen.  It may be a garbage series overall but least it had the so bad its good charm which is the only reason I gave that series a 2/10 only because it had good comedy. However, I cannot say the same thing for King&#039;s Game this show is one of the most insulting, embarrassing, unfunny, lazy and inept anime I had ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Am going to end my intro here because this fucking piece of horse shit does not deserve my intro since this show clearly don&#039;t even give a fuck about anything so why should I.<br />
<br />
The story of Kings Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa who transferred to a high school. Due to the events of the last King Game his now afraid of getting intimate with his new classmates. Very soon he starts to open up to his classmates during the sports festival class relay. However, this doesn’t last long as he and his classmates received an email from &quot;King and from there start to go down.<br />
<br />
Before I kick the show back to the anime rabbit hole. the King’s Game is.<br />
Ousama Game or King’s Game in English is a game where a class of 32 people takes part in the survival game. Each student will receive a message from phones about the King order that they have to follow or else they will be punished/killed. Why did I explain this because the King Game is the worst survival game I have seen in fiction. Not only it’s contrived as hell as well being poorly constricted but the game keeps adding new rules that were not told from the first episode of the anime.<br />
Besides the King’s Game itself being a broken mess this show writing is abysmal as well having some of the worst shock value I have seen in anime.<br />
<br />
It doesn’t help the fact that the show relays heavily on the fucking flashbacks. Flashbacks, in general, are fine as long they have a purpose but Kings Games really got carried away with this. This show likes to random flashback to the previous King’s Game as well dealing with the current King’s Game that is going on in this anime and because of that, the show’s pacing is fucking broken!!! This show has the worst pacing I have ever seen in anime. <br />
<br />
What’s makes the pacing worse is the broken narrative. One of the best examples of the show’s fucking horrendous narrative is in episode 5 where the entire episode was a flashback of the events of the last King Game and the episode never goes back to the current King’s Game that is currently happening. It would have been better if the show did this episode 1 would have been dedicated to showing off the new King’s Game was happening then have it where our main character Nobuaki actually tells his experience with the previous kings game to everyone in the class than you have the next 3 to 5 episodes showcase all the events of previous King&#039; Game. I know it will be a flashback but do you know what it makes more sense in the narrative than you could have the last several episodes being dedicated to the actual true story that we are dealing with which is the current kings game instead of every episode in the show where it goes from the flashback of the last King&#039;s Game as well showing a little bit of the actual episode itself that isn&#039;t a flashback. In short, the narrative of this show is a fucking mess.<br />
<br />
Now if you though the pacing and narrative of this show are broken the show decides to butcher serious sensitive topics such as rape/forced sex to the point where it becomes a joke because almost all of the order has something to do with sex and rape. <br />
I CANNOT FUCKING STAND IT WHEN ANIME INCLUDE SENSITIVE TOPIC SUCH SEX AND RAPE IN THEY NOVELS!!! I swear the director for this show must be a disgraceful human being who thinks rape and forced sex is normal. <br />
<br />
The characters in The King’s Game are just moving bodies with edgy and cringe-worthy personalities.  The characters have no character development in the slightest, and they are not even likable. Every single character except for 1 which I will get into a bit are idiots. <br />
Kanazawa Nobuaki is a horrendous mentally broken down protagonist. <br />
Natsuko is a shitty nice girl type of a character who has a psychopathic side to her <br />
Naoya is your cookie cutter best friend type character.<br />
Ria is the only character in this show that I can consider to be kinda decent. Unlike every other human being in this show, she’s the only character that has a decently told back-story that we can relate too.<br />
It such a shame that she gets killed off after a certain episode in the series.<br />
However, Ria alone cannot save this pathetic excuse of a character cast.<br />
<br />
The rest of the characters are all utter shit that you don’t ever care for because they all have a brain size of Homer Simpson and they are all dumber than rocks. They are not even worth mention in the slightest.<br />
In short, the characters in this show are a fucking failure in every way possible.<br />
<br />
Before I tear apart the visuals am going to talk anime studio Seven. Before they did this show they have done shows such as I can’t understand what is my husband is saying and Hentai. <br />
Why did I bring this up? BECAUSE THE VISUALS ARE A FUCKING DISGRACE!!!<br />
Boring background designs, shitty characters designs mixed with pathetic animation, camera directing, still frames and lots of budget cuts that rival episode 4 of Tokyo Ghoul Root A.<br />
<br />
It’s like this show was originally meant to be a Hentai but some dumbass from studio seven decided to censor most the sexual acts visually and decided to add a plot that is contrived as hell.<br />
Am just going to end the visuals selection here since this show clearly doesn&#039;t give fuck about anything. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is dull and just plain bad.<br />
The opening of the show FEED THE FIRE&quot; by coldrain is a great song and its easily the best thing about the anime then again if the best thing about your anime is an anime opening that can be downloaded to your phone as an mp3 file you know fucked up.<br />
The ending theme is generic and it not even worth mentioning at all.<br />
As for sub and dub, they are both mediocre overall and they are not even worth mentioning at all. I honestly feel bad for the Seyiuus and English voice actors who had to follow this garbage script.<br />
<br />
This anime represents everything that is wrong with anime.<br />
It’s an anime that is so bad that it actually piss off the viewer intelligence as well making the shittest animes like Big Order and Eromanga Sensei look decent in comparison. It also fails as B movie type anime because unlike Mayoiga the show not only tries to take itself too seriously and fails but it takes serious/sensitive topics such as sex and rape and butchers them to the point where it all those topics becomes a joke for a narrative. <br />
The story was utter shit, the pacing was horrendous, the characters are hot garbage, the visuals are bad and the soundtrack was bland and boring.<br />
<br />
This is the worst thing I have ever seen from this anime medium and I don’t think it will ever be topped. It’s such an insult in every way and makes me want to watch things like Eromanga Sensei and Big Order again. As much I despise those shows for its offensive content and horrific characters. I rather take that than watch this broken show again<br />
Is it worse than Skelter Heaven and Mars of Destruction? hell yeah because least those ovas were only 19 minutes long. This piece of contrived rabbit hole shit is 276 minutes long.<br />
Stay away from this garbage no matter how much curious you are because it will bring you nothing but misery.<br />
<br />
Final Score.  <br />
As much I want to this garbage a deserved 0/10 I can’t because MAL doesn’t have a 0/10 opinion. Until MAL has a 0/10 opinion I have sadly give this piece of shit that belongs in the rabbit hole a 1/10<br />

    Do you value your free time? Do you consider yourself of average intelligence?  If the answer is yes to both questions, then you should stay away from Ousama Game. I usually abstain from writing reviews, even more so for incomplete anime, but I thought I should warn any person who might be in false hopes that this anime could be good because it has Miyano Mamoru’s name attached, just like my naive past self.<br />
<br />
This anime is basically about a classroom that starts receiving orders from a self-proclaimed King via texts. If they don’t obey these orders then the King punishes them, usually with death.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262715">
        If this sounds semi-interesting to you, then prepare yourself for disappointment because this horror premise is basically an excuse for the author to write copious amounts of nonsensical, perverted situations. The orders are basically Fuck or Die with a heavy dose of NTR. There is nothing the King would gain from sending these orders other than to masturbate at the students’ desperation and consensual cuckoldry.<br />
<br />
With this premise, I thought I would feel sorry for the characters. However even disregarding their incredibly bland and archetypal characterization, they always do unreasonable stuff that results in their deaths. If that&#039;s 50% of the case, then the other half is them being surprised at things that should be a given at any point. No sign of intelligence or reason here.<br />
<br />
Frankly I would give this 1 but it has made me chuckle a few times: it really tries to take itself seriously but it’s so forcibly edgy that it&#039;s unintentionally hilarious. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone except for those who might want to laugh at how low the anime industry can stoop.

    Survival anime are nothing new when looking back over the last few years. Shows such as Btooom!, Danganropa and Mirai Nikki are all based around a particular survival game and have all found moderate to massive popularity among anime fans. Even outside of anime, you just have to look at franchises like The Hunger Games and Maze Runner to see how successful the subgenre is. It’s clear that stories based around a group of characters, their impending doom and how they try to survive such are intriguing to a lot of people. But why is that? Personally, I believe these kinds of premises can present

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265820">
        a darker look at morality; show a darker side to ourselves through characters put in a severe set of circumstances that test one’s beliefs, values, friendships. It’s surprising how a simple concept can turn into a thrilling experience hard to match anywhere else. But this is where I have a problem with most survival anime; they begin with a simplistic setup and never get deeper. Things like character development and thematic exploration are barely touched on in these shows, with more time used for cheap thrills, cringe-worthy horror and overall mindless entertainment. This is an anime that manages to fail at even these aspects.<br />
<br />
King’s Game: The Animation is an anime adaptation of a series of “cell phone novels” and is the most recent example of an anime to present us with a survival game that pits everyone against one another until there is one left standing. Considering what I could take from the poorly-designed cover art to the production studio behind it: Seven, who also made a couple Slice of Life comedies I’ve barely heard of and a ton of hentai, I didn’t have much in the way of expectations that this show would be anything good, but I was hopeful that it would at least be a fun watch. That was a mistake. King’s Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa, the winner of the previous “King’s Game” as he transfers to a new school in an attempt to escape his terrible past. Unfortunately, the game follows him and now his new class are all subjected to the survival game that Nobuaki is all too familiar with. The basic rules of the game are: obey any order sent by the King within 24 hours, failure to do so will result in punishment/death and everyone involved must play to the end. Now, with all the basic information out of the way, here is how King’s Game: The Animation manages to turn a rather generic concept into one of the biggest fuckups of the entire year.<br />
<br />
The first major problem with this anime is how it introduces the game, more specifically the “orders” from the King that everyone must obey. The first order involves Nobuaki and classmate Natsuko Honda having to kiss, otherwise they’ll be “punished”. The first order is extremely childish considering this is supposed to be a game where people’s lives are on the line. Show like this need to have some high stakes and consequences to match how serious the game is, also adding suspense and excitement to what characters will do, even if they’re predictable. In the first episode, any sense of initial weight here is lost once you see how all of the orders feel like they were made by a 10-year-old. And if you thought ordering people to kiss was already a dumb move, prepare yourself, because most of the orders shown throughout the show are forcing students to have sex with each other. Let me ask, how is one supposed to take a death game seriously at all when a majority of it is about groping breasts and coerced sex? It’s absurd and should not be taken seriously. Other dumb orders include not sleeping before you have obeyed an instruction and not doing anything unnecessary for 24 hours. If you didn’t understand the last order, don’t worry, the entire game isn’t worth the time and even the minimal effort required to understand. This is clearly a case of a simple concept turned ridiculous due to how serious the show tries to take it. But what’s even more ridiculous is the characters involved in the game.<br />
<br />
King’s Game deals with a class of 32 students, not including characters from Nobuaki’s past and none of them are developed to where you are supposed to about them except for the protagonist, and even then he comes off so bland and uninteresting that I’m sure a lot of people watching won’t care about him or the show a couple weeks after finishing said show. In fact, it probably would’ve been better to have killed Nobuaki off midway so it wouldn’t have been so predictably boring. But I digress. Most of the characters are just expendable and are made as victims of the punishments in a poor attempt to justify the gravity of their predicament. Literally about a dozen characters with no prior screen time die on the first day because they were sleeping, and viewers are expected to care? You don’t create sympathy from your audience by killing off characters in such a way with their only key feature being that they exist! That’s one of the most obvious examples of lazy writing in anime. But the poor writing doesn’t stop there, since most of the characters that do get screen time are completely one-dimensional, have no interesting traits and can be easily replaced with any of the nameless character that got killed off first. It’s one thing to say in an anime like this you only know a little about 2-3 characters after the first episode, it’s a whole other issue when half-way through watching, you still only now about a couple of characters when over half of the class is already dead. Not good King’s Game, not good.<br />
<br />
But that’s not all, because it just so happens that basically every single character in the show is a retard to the point where even if these characters were developed at all, it would still be difficult to feel anything when these characters die because of their own stupidity. The most blatant example of how autistic they can get is when Natsuko is ordered to have sex with a guy, asks to have sex with Nobuaki first, and then when denied does a whole 180 personality-wise, grabbing the initial dude and tries to do the act in front of all her other classmates. They try to play it off saying she was always psychotic and only acted nice, but considering how she was nice to everyone around her and even showed interest in Nobuaki before the game, I see this . But this is just small example compared to the dozens of time where characters show their complete ignorance to what is even happening around them. These characters are still kids, but the idea that most of them are unable to think for themselves what other players are doing in a game of life or death is bewildering to say the least. It’s like they have selective memory loss where they all just forget what happened 2 minutes before when a character was acting like a lunatic. Even just thinking about how the show would work in our world brings forth a whole new set of questions that the show never ever acknowledges because it knows just how full of bullshit it really is. For example, if so many students in the same class have died in such a short amount of time, wouldn’t there be police involved? Wouldn’t any of the students try and tell someone who isn’t a part of the game about what’s happening? Oh wait, I forgot. This anime doesn’t bother showing characters that are not part of the game. The way that King’s Game avoids showing any sort of outside influence that would have an impact on the game is enough to tell me that this is nothing more that mindless entertainment at a very low standard.<br />
<br />
Another big issue with King’s Game is how it tells its story. The story overall is not difficult to tell but it tries to combine both the present game with flashbacks of the previous game Nobuaki was a part of before transferring and it ends up being detrimental to the show. The flashbacks shown usually take up most of the episode and makes it a lot more difficult for most present-day characters to get any proper focus or development before they are killed off. The characters in these flashbacks can also easily be confused with characters in the present due to how similar all of their designs are, making it harder to differentiate between the two timelines at times. The transitions between the two timelines does not help to distinguish when a time-jump has occurred. I understand that this anime is trying to adapt 2 different instalments to the franchise, but it ends up being so unnecessary as all that was needed to show was few scenes with Nobuaki and his former classmates rather than encompass more than 1 story in 12 episodes. The outcome of the past game is already given as Nobuaki says himself that he was the only survivor. And the saddest part, most of the characters in the flashback are more developed that characters in the current and try to find out what the King’s Game really is, when it really should be the other way around as the flashbacks stop at episode 7, leaving us to deal with shit characters play out this shit storyline for the rest of this shit anime.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the punishments and actual deaths in this anime, I am once again disappointed. Not only because of how cheap so many of these deaths feel, but of how these death are nearly always shameless gore fests, yet not so over-the-top that they end up being hilarious. King’s Game is actually very similar to Another, a 2012 horror anime that also featured a cast of school students and had most of them dying in some of the most exaggerated ways possible that it almost turned the show into a comedy. Seriously, watch a couple of the deaths in Another, on their own they are way better than the actual show. I wouldn’t be surprised if the deaths shown here in King’s Game were inspired by Another, but even then, King’s Game fails to do that right. It has around the same amount of death and bloodshed as Another, but was never amusing, and while part of that is due to stupid actions by the characters, the execution of these deaths are also just anticlimactic. I never thought I would ever say that seeing a character literally explode in a pile of blood was boring, but alas here we are. Well done King’s Game, you even fail at being an entertaining piece of garbage.<br />
<br />
Now all that’s been said so far should tell you how awful this show is, but here I give you the biggest problem I have with this anime: The King. From the start of the anime the one in charge of ordering and killing off students is shrouded in mystery along with his method of action. The way he comes across as this seemingly omniscient and omnipotent villain had unique powers over victims similar to Light Yagami and the Death Note. But I was more concerned with the why. Why would someone or something so powerful and dangerous being dicking around with a class of teenagers, telling them to fuck each other or die a woeful death? What do they wish to gain from this and why do they not aim for something greater? But then King’s Game makes the revelation of the force behind it all, it is perhaps the most idiotic reveal I have seen in an anime. Ever. Anyone else theorizing about what could be behind it all gets figuratively dick-slapped as it makes any work or effort into understanding what this power is and how the students can beat it absolutely worthless! I’m not going to reveal the origins of the King’s Game but trust me when I tell you that it is almost as disrespectful as getting blue-balled by your partner on Christmas Day (bitch). I mentioned before how all the orders felt like they were conceived by a 10-year-old, but after learning about who the King really is I wouldn’t be surprised if the original writer had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. <br />
<br />
The only part of King’s Game that I can really commend it on is the production values, but even that has its fair share of problems. I’m not much of a stickler on the animation of a show, but let’s be real: this show was made in 2017, and it looks like it could have been made over a decade ago. Aside from some backgrounds, there is nothing visually impressive about this show and feels lacklustre for the most part. You just need to see how they animate broken fingers to understand how dull and low budget this project was. But it does have its merits: effective facial expressions convey a lot of emotion and a dark colour palette suited the theme of the show, and I can say that the animation was tolerable. The same goes for the sound, with nothing memorable with regards to OSTs yet nothing godawful. I know a lot of people will praise the show’s opening as the best of the season, but I found it boring after a few episodes, with the main line “THIS IS THE END THIS IS THE END!!!!” becoming a meme of the show. And honestly Inuyashiki came out the same season with an OP very similar, but about a dozen times better. The voice acting was below par all across the board, with the English dub being even worse. But if I had to choose, I would still pick the dub, because at least that way I won’t have to think about the show as much, giving my head a well-deserved rest after pushing through this.<br />
<br />
And there you have it. That is King’s Game: The Animation; a disordered, pathetic abomination of an anime I plan to never lay eyes on again. We’re at the end of 2017 and yet shit like this is still being made, but this is nothing new. King’s Game is literally Mayoiga: The Lost Village – One Year Later, and if you’ve never heard of Mayoiga, just look at its mean score and that will tell you all one needs to know. They were both cringeworthy horror borefests that started off bad and only devolved into something so pathetic that even the biggest advocators of schlock entertainment would find masochistic. At this point, King’s Game is worse than just edgy; it cuts deep and it hurts, before leaving a permanent scar; something to always remind you of how foolish you were to try and handle the King’s Game. You weren’t raped physically, but mentally and emotionally are left desecrated and missing a part of your soul that you’ll never get back. This is the chance one takes when watching any intriguing seasonal anime. Was it worth it?

    Don&#039;t watch this anime if you can&#039;t laugh at how bad it is. The only joy you will get out of this is seeing how bad an anime can get, nothing else. <br />
This show is not dark, something that&#039;s dark would be something like Berserk. <br />
This show is not edgy, something that&#039;s edgy would be Elfen Lied. <br />
This show is even worse than edgy. <br />
<br />
Regarding the technical aspects. <br />
The music is very mediocre, and the sounds are sometimes out of sync. <br />
<br />
The art style is acceptable, but the facial expressions can be very ridiculous, and the gore scenes are over-the-top. <br />
<br />
The animation is just plain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262875">
        bad, you can clearly see how low-budget this show is. But I think even that small budget was a waste of money.

    2017 has been an underwhelming year for fanatics of horror and survival based anime. Taking a close look at the lineups, there were barely any at all and the only ones we’ve got were short series that were easily forgettable. Where does Ousama Game position itself on the board? Terrible doesn’t even begin to describe what this anime turned out to be. Ousama Game is a primal example of how desperately an anime tries to get viewers to appreciate. It’s a catastrophe that self-destructed from the very start that the meme of “so bad, it’s good” doesn’t even come to close to describe what it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265818">
        really is.<br />
<br />
I can talk for hours about what went wrong with Ousama Game (King’s Game) but to start, we have to understand what this anime is really about. On the surface, it’s a survival horror show based on the manga of the franchise. The synopsis is very straightforward and highlights the rules of the King’s Game. At the center of it, we have a young man named Nobuaki Kanazawa who gets involved in this death game scenario as his life changes forever. <br />
<br />
At first glance, this anime seems to have some potential. The idea of a death game can be mildly entertaining despite how predictable these type of shows turns out to be. However, Ousama Game turns into a cheap social experiment of horror gimmicks that tried way too hard to look cool. Forget, cool. This show is asinine on so many levels that by the time you watch the first few episodes, you will label it as an unintentional comedy. Despite the show portraying it as a serious story, it’s absurdly stupid in many ways. These are found through the examples of the characters’ decisions, poorly executed plot twists, and over the top exposition that becomes a chore to watch. At first glance, you’d think that exposition is important for a show like this. But overall, it degenerates into a cluster of boring info dump with cheap story selling. What does this show really want to accomplish? I had to ask myself many times throughout the show because every time I finish an episode, it makes me shake my head at how it fails to capitalize on anything.<br />
<br />
The character cast consists of students from Nobuaki’s class. Because this show has a lot of characters, don’t expect any of them to get memorable characterization. The main focus is how Nobuaki tries so desperately to save others but always comes up short that ends in sorrow. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to ever sympathize with character loss in this show because there’s just nothing to feel for them. They are dropped like jobbers in some wrestling drama not because it’s predictable but because they are too blend to appreciate. Once in a while, there are shows that has a breakout character emerge from the blues. Ousama Game has none of them and its entire character cast is terribly written. For main male protagonist Nobuaki, he is far too generic to be any sort of hero. On the opposite side, there’s Natsuko, a manipulate woman who cares about nothing but herself. The show portrays her as a psychopath that no one should trust and to be honest, there’s not a single thing to like about her. It’s as if the show itself is self-aware in making her the most hateful character. If that was its intention, then it got the point across with all the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
Now I will say one thing. Ousama Game’s creator and story seems to really try to bring out the best of what it can work with. It consists of 12 episodes and that’s no easy task. However, the anime is a laughter stock with the genres it tries to capitalize. First, there’s hardly any mystery. Sure, there’s the “King” and the game itself has some suspense. But at some point, do you really care? Most if not all the cast are going to die anyway so what’s there to get thrilled about? Then, there’s the horror. Does this show really feel scary? If we talk about the death scenes, then that would be unintentionally comical. I can’t fandom how many times I laughed at character deaths. These ranges from jumping out from windows, hands being broken to pieces by overusing a computer mouse, or even heads twisted 180 degrees because why not. Some scenes are also censored (maybe fixed in BDs) that makes shows like Terra Formars look like a masterpiece. The supernatural elements of this anime is also very poorly executed such as the numerous times when the deaths happen. And drama? Oh, I already mentioned Natsuko since she’s the guiltiest of this example. Still, the overall drama is so ill written that characters are locked in a conflict with no interest. Now that I think about it, this anime is really missing a comedy tag because of absurdly amusing it becomes as more and more the “plot” unravels.<br />
<br />
Studio Seven’s effort in animating this show really makes me want to question if they even tried at all. This is technically one of their few full length show they’ve produced and yet, it fails in a lot of ways. Character designs looks cheaply made like they are from some B-horror movie. While character expressions at times can deliver psychology, it ultimately falls apart due to its raw quality. The violence also comes off in the wrong way with how dumb it looks. Finally, the fan service is just unbearable. There are sometimes fan service in horror shows that can be a guilty pleasure to watch. However, Ousama’s Game is just a pure disgrace with terribly timed segments and censorship.<br />
<br />
To be honest, there’s only one aspect of this anime I enjoyed and it’s the music. “Feed the Fire” by coldrain is one of the noticeable theme songs from this year with its rock/metal hybrid style choreography. It’s a shame their talent is wasted for a show like this. On the other hand, character voices are very annoying to listen to after a while. Nobuaki’s desperate screaming when things go wrong is extremely unbearable. Natsuko’s manipulative voice clearly gives a vile intention to make us hate her more. Other cast members are pretty much all forgettable except when you hear them scream to their deaths.<br />
<br />
Trying to get to the finish line for this show was a challenge for me. It’s like I was thrown into bugged video game and trying to find a way out. Ousama Game is among one of the worst horror survival shows I’ve seen in recent years. The unintentional humor fails to deliver itself in every way and a slap to the face for anyone that expected something good out of this show. The character cast are like puppets of a poorly made performance. And the story? Just burn it with a fire. <br />
<br />
There’s an infamous meme that “anime was a mistake” in the community these days.  Just ask Ousama Game and you’ll see why.<br />

    King&#039;s game is by far one of the best anime that has been released in the last 10 years. For true anime fans who watch this instant classic, they know for sure that King&#039;s game is a defining step forward for the genre. <br />
<br />
For a long time, many anime like my hero academia have been claimed to have taken this title. But, these anime have been nothing but shallow stories for children. While King&#039;s game takes anime BACK to it&#039;s roots and delivers a mature story with well written and deep character.<br />
<br />
King&#039;s game also covers very mature themes including death (obviously), sex and rape, young

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325762">
        girls being put into uncomfortable situations, and many more. The death scenes in this are also top notch. Specifically the girls deaths are some of the best in anime and show how mature and deep the medium can get. <br />
<br />
The story is also amazing. With many of the girls now ranking in the top of my list of characters of all time. <br />
<br />
I would recommend anyone watch this. It is an instant classic. <br />
<br />
10/10!

    For you guys who value morality or only like animes for their cuteness and for fun purpose, you guys should stay away from this one. IT&#039;S NOT FOR YOU GUYS. <br />
<br />
This anime would be well-received by people who like one of the following genres: thriller, mystery, tragedy, psychological or who like anime like Higurashi, Mirai Nikki, Danganroppa or Elfen Lied.<br />
<br />
This anime is really outstanding personally speaking, from the first episode up to sixth which I&#039;ve watched I can&#039;t wait for the next episode to come out since it was just too good.<br />
<br />
The story starts off with some kind of reminiscence or stuff about MC with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262910">
        Chiemi and then goes back to MC current time. From there the story develops supported by good characterization, great art, and sound. Episode by episodes the reminiscence which start off the anime would be unveiled about the last Ousama Game. Also, in this anime peoples, bad side and good side were depicted beautifully and precise.

    TLDR:<br />
This anime is the most tasty garbage.<br />
If you like to watch things like The Room, Birdemic, or Mayoiga you will have a great time watching this show! I recommend watching with friends for a good laugh! 8/10<br />
If you don&#039;t get a laugh out of absurdly bad shows, leave now and never look back. Without ironic enjoyment, this show deserves a 4/10<br />
<br />
FULL REVIEW:<br />
<br />
STORY: 6/10<br />
A high school class begins receiving text message commands, that if they disobey they die in a most gruesome manner. I&#039;m talking screaming, exploding body parts, and projectile limbs. The story can be confusing at times, but for the most part its very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262894">
        easy to follow whats going on. <br />
The King&#039;s orders usually boil down to &quot;have sex with this person&quot; or  &quot;one person has to choose someone to die&quot;. We end up with lots of similar situations but the show does a good job of switching up what reactions the characters have, and the ways in which they die.<br />
This story could have made a good show if it was executed better, but instead we get this lovely masterpiece. <br />
<br />
ART: 4/10<br />
Mediocre for the most part with peaks and valleys, and some truly baffling shots. It is much more ambition than it has the money for, leading to some genuinely hilarious moments. The poor art adds a lot to making this show as funny as it is. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 5/10<br />
The opening is edgy as hell and definitely sets the mood. Otherwise nothing to complain about or compliment.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 5/10<br />
All of them are bland, with some having slightly more personality than others. But it doesn&#039;t bother me much as the fun part is watching them get trashed by the King&#039;s game. They serve their purpose but I certainly won&#039;t be remembering any of them once done with this show.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
Adding this to my collection of shows I ironically enjoy. I&#039;ve been watching this show weekly for 6 weeks, and at the end of every episode I&#039;m begging for more. I have laughed out loud for this show more than for some shows that are actually trying to be comedies. Roll with the stupidity and you will have a great time.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8/10<br />
This show is absolutely ridiculous, and thinks edgy=good. The characters are bland, and the art only serviceable. But by golly, is this show trying its best to be entertaining. Try your shot at it if you&#039;re interested, if your sense of humor matches with mine, you will have a great time with this show.

    I personally found this anime very enjoyable. If you enjoy watching people brutally killed, suffer, break their fingers, forced to have sex, extreme drama and female character with evil/sadistic personality, then this is the right anime for you. <br />
<br />
For me this anime proves that you don&#039;t always need those &quot;well written anime&quot; to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
A lot of haters here are just judging anime based how well written the story and how much plot holes or because some character act stupidly in some situation. Those haters start analyzing the this anime as if it is Shakespeare story book or some kind of scientific journal. I don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265823">
        take anime too seriously. Character in anime does not always have to act the same way that people expect in real life<br />
<br />
For me this show is just a pure enjoyment. It entertaining (for me) to watch fictional people suffer and try hard to survive. It does not matter if the story is weak and poorly written when I&#039;m enjoying it. I&#039;m on episode 11 when I wrote this review, and last few episodes were the best in my opinion so far <br />
<br />
Many of those who gave it 1/10 or 2/10 watched it until the last episode which makes me suspect that many of these haters don&#039;t genuinely believe that anime deserve such a low score. I mean why watch something that you think deserve such low score until the end ?! If I rate something 1/10 then that thing has to be so boring that I could not watch it at all<br />
<br />
<br />
It is also worth to mention that this show is noting like Mayoiga. Mayoiga  is children version of Ousama Game. If you found Mayoiga  boring like me then does not mean Ousama Game is same. Ousama game is real dark/horror show with people slaughtered in every place unlike  Mayoiga

    Ousama Game is undoubtedly among the worst pieces of Japanese media that has ever been produced and most definitely the worst anime I’ve had the experience of consuming. I’ve been seeing a lot of people saying that this anime has a good concept and is only hindered by poor directing but the slew of issues with this anime would lead me to believe that either what these people find interesting is the genre itself or they are just plain blind to the plethora of issues plaguing this production. Before you spend four and a half hours of your life watching this abomination for whatever reason

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265842">
        I want to make one thing clear to you, you’re wasting your time.<br />
 <br />
The plot is complete and utter nonsense. There is no direction at all and it’s filled with more holes than Shia LaBeouf has seen in his entire lifetime. As one thing is explained, three more questions arise, and eventually you’re left wondering if the guy writing this was on crack and a random stream of words just poured out from his brain, without any regard for keeping the thing coherent. To convolute things even more, the story switches from current day to past events without any sort of indication or distinction whatsoever in an attempt to create “parallels” between the current events and the main character&#039;s past experiences, and also explain why things are happening a certain way and what might happen in the future. This, of course, only succeeds in making the viewer more confused and have even more questions about what is happening as the scenes don’t have any sort of direction or flow. Finally when an explanation that isn’t a non-answer finally is given (praise the lord), it equates to deus ex machina and is a spit in the face to people who faithfully followed along, waiting for some sort of break or light at the end of the tunnel. Who woulda thunk it?<br />
 <br />
The “characters” act more as walking plot devices, as their actions make no sense and quite literally serve only to shoehorn the plot further. You won’t encounter an “important” character until the plot needs to be advanced, even though they’re all supposed to be classmates and you’re supposed to have seen all of them in the first episode. Instead you are shown a bunch of generic background characters in the beginning and only a few key main ones while rest are thought up on the fly and designed in a way specifically fit to the scenario at hand. The consistency in their interactions are also non-existent. Alliances are formed out of nowhere, and attitudes toward each other change with the drop of a hat. I should also mention that the author self inserted himself into the story, as the protagonist was named after himself and was designed to be a walking pity party and savior, all in one package. Quite a piece of work isn’t he?<br />
 <br />
On the technical side of things unsurprisingly things aren’t looking too hot either. Scenes look subpar at best and complete arse at worst. All the budget is spent on random character’s death scenes instead of sequences actually important to the advancement of the already trainwreck plot. A few of the voice actors tried the best they could, but with the script they were given it’s hard to give a good performance, while others were just quite simply not good at all. The music is unoriginal, uninspired, and ripped from an album released last year making the lack or mismanagement of budget glaringly obvious. So overall, not a good look whatsoever.<br />
 <br />
If it hasn&#039;t become apparent by now, there is absolutely no reason to watch this anime. It fails in absolutely every aspect, and doesn’t even make an attempt to fix itself. It actively cancels its own canon, lies to you, and spits in your face when everything&#039;s said and done. It’s not self aware, it’s not ironic, and you won’t even get enjoyment from watching it as a meme. If you have any self respect, if you consider yourself to have even average human intelligence, you will stay away from this series.

    I dropped this series after four episodes, and if you watch the series, I hope you can see why.<br />
<br />
This anime is a major insult to the horror anime genre. The concept of the story, a &quot;king&quot; assigning tasks or else face death sounds really good in theory, but in practice, is not the case. The story was executed so poorly, with so many plotholes appearing; it&#039;s just unbearable. All we see is just more boring content.<br />
<br />
There are also way too many flashbacks. This anime is based off of the second manga, Ousama Game: Shuukyoku, however, literally splices half of the first manga into it. They

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263756">
        should&#039;ve just made an adaptation of the first manga, and then made a second anime; though I don&#039;t think anybody would watch it.<br />
<br />
The only good thing about this series is the anime opening, which is really disappointing because the opening sets out the series as an amazing horror series, but the anime itself if just a massive disappointment.<br />
<br />
I would recommend that all people avoid this anime.

    I never write reviews, but this is the worst anime I have ever seen and I believe that I should warn people not to watch it.<br />
<br />
One of the problems it has is the fact that all of its characters are completely forgettable. I am on the 6th episode and lots of people have died. However, I could only tell you something about 2 or 3 of them. <br />
<br />
Another problem is the fact that a lot of the characters die in the same or the next episode in which they are introduced (or get a bit of focus). This does not only mean that it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262915">
        very predictable to tell who will die in this episode, you also do not care about them all that much because you do not know them. What is even worst, they are generally presented as selfish persons that only want to survive without caring about the other people that die. If this was done right, you could be rooting for one or the other character to survive, but the anime is clearly trying to make you root for the main characters.<br />
<br />
I could get over that if you did not know if the main characters are going to make it or not. However, most of the story is told in flashbacks, as the main protagonist explains to his new classmates his previous experience in the game. This means that, from the very first episode, you know that the main character is the only one who makes it alive.<br />
<br />
And those are not even the main problems I have with this anime. I honestly like the premise. However, this anime takes all the problems that could come out of this premise and decides that, as far as they do not show them on screen, they do not exist. For example, how is it possible that after half of their classmates have died the police still has not appeared? I could understand it if none of the players wanted to go and tell the police about the game if it was a rule (which it is not) but I would be really surprised if I was in high school, half of my classmates had died and the police still had not come to talk with me.<br />
<br />
In fact, the anime does as much as it can to avoid showing other characters than the people playing the game, maybe assuming that we will not realise how stupid it is for the characters to not try and seek for help from other people. The worst case so far is in episode 6, where the main character literally explains (via flashback) to some new classmates how multiple of his old classmates died while sitting next to a taxi driver as he is driving them to the place they want to go. However, the taxi driver does not appear on screen and that is apparently enough for the show to justify why this person does not freak out.<br />
<br />
And there are many more problems with this anime, such as characters behaving irrationally or suddenly behaving completely opposite to what they did previously, but if I had to analyze them as much as I have for the previous ones this review would end up being an essay. So this is my conclusion: do not watch this anime.

    Stunning. This show is the breath of fresh air the anime industry needed. Never before have I seen a show go to such lengths to cover its bases. The voice acting, music production, even the screen lighting is some of the most top notch work I&#039;ve seen in a very long time. A few weeks back, I mentioned in an article that I had started Ousama Game over a decade ago and dropped it because it bored me. To anime fans, this is about the same as saying, “I really love the Bible but I am not keen on this whole God character.”  Boy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272068">
        was I wrong.  Putting off the masterpiece of Ousama game was the single greatest mistake of my life.  A lot of people tell me that Ousama game is what got them into anime. And it&#039;s easy to see why: It&#039;s nothing like the vast majority of American cartoons of its time.  Ousama game is the primary stepping stone into the highly coveted elitist realm of anime.  <br />
<br />
I cannot recommended this show enough 10/10

    This.. This animation is possibly one of the most horrendous things I&#039;ve seen in a while. It surprises me to how it&#039;s even above a 5 on MAL, considering the disgusting amounts of tropes, and generic development, not to mention the completely mindless protagonist that just doesn&#039;t fit in the genre it&#039;s marketing. Watching the first couple episodes with friends, I&#039;ve seen all I needed to decide that this is possibly one of the lowest of the low, during this season; hell, for the past 4-5 seasons. I&#039;ll summarize this piece at the bottom, and for those avid and mindful readers; I&#039;ll throw in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263090">
        bit more detail.<br />
<br />
Story : 4/10<br />
Okay, fair enough; A game that revolves around those slice-of-life anime where the King somehow gets the heroine and protagonist to have an inspirational moment together. Only except; nobody knows who the King actually is, along with the fact that people must do every action. It&#039;s all fun and games until somebody dies, right? Only except.. The death&#039;s for not fulfilling the orders of the King feels so unjustified. Oh, that generic background character that doesn&#039;t listen to the pleads of the protagonist and beats kids up suddenly EXPLODES into a pile of blood. They don&#039;t believe any of the reasoning behind the game, but they decide to meet up, y&#039;know, like an atheist suddenly heading to a church to xxxx on the bible or something. To an extent; it&#039;s entertaining watching characters obtain superiority over others, where a nobody suddenly becomes the King and tells some guy he hates to literally &quot;kys,&quot; but with the 1-episode 0 development deaths, the audience sits there thinking &quot;Oh, they died.&quot; Also, actions of each character slowly becomes more predictable after the realization of dying if the duty is not fulfilled, literally following every line of the order to survive. &quot;Go kiss this girl?&quot; Oh, I wonder what the person who received that will do? It&#039;s like watching a bunch of children trying throw their rocks higher than the other, in attempts to awe the watchers. &quot;Look at me, I&#039;ll go this far to save my life, haha.&quot; *** This also relates back a couple years to the old &quot;Blue Whale Game&quot; trend, where people follow orders from above; inevitably leading the player to kill themselves. Yes, this a real thing.<br />
<br />
Art : 6/10<br />
Well, it&#039;s not like animation style can be put down simply cause the concept is poor. Most of the scenes are presented own up to what the animator or studio wishes to show off. However, when other categories intercept with this, the value of the art goes down, as its mood and tone it SHOULD display ends up in the gutter. Instead, you laugh as the protagonist desperately tries to stop his classmates from victimizing themselves. haHa, so funny<br />
<br />
Sound : 3/10<br />
Remember Asta from Black Clover? Screaming every couple seconds? Imagine that with the over-the-top worry and crying in every episode. For me, at least; it gets annoying and reduces the immersion into the story. Simply put; the sound becomes so vanilla that the emotions behind it become stale. Why in gods name does the protagonist cry over literally EVERY SINGLE DEATH (okay, that&#039;s exaggerated, but you get the point). Let this become a bridge over to the god-awful character development<br />
<br />
Character : 1/10<br />
Alright, MC is up to the base for batting again, because apparently he had already attended one of these games, which is why he&#039;s got that clean new edge to cut his classmates apart, but the details of the previous game don&#039;t get revealed until later, you know? NOT IMPORTANT. Somehow, the biggest puxxy from the last King&#039;s Game WON IT. You&#039;d think it&#039;d be someone intelligent, and able to manipulate the game to his liking; or maybe someone maniacal, and able to kill and do something completely insane without a heart, or tear. Believe it or not, we have the protagonist that suddenly loves his classmates over the course of like.. A couple weeks, enough to cry over their deaths. The development relies heavily on his past, such as the previous heroine that the MC liked --&gt; Into the trillions of others that he suddenly meets in this new class. Other characters? Just the typical mysterious girl that has some ace up her sleeve, but doesn&#039;t care to show it, A bunch of jocks with ogre thinking of &quot;Me die If I No Follow Order,&quot; and a collection of pretty flowers that probably have a dirt personality hidden underneath. If this isn&#039;t enough to show off the lack of development throughout the first couple episodes; other than the details that should&#039;ve already been provided from the experienced MC, then Nisekoi must have traveled like a bullet.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 2/10<br />
You get it; a simple knack of &quot;Wow, I can&#039;t believe he did this.&quot; and &quot;What can top that.&quot; Characters? God awful, I haven&#039;t seen any characters that had likable traits. It&#039;s simply a sit-and-watch the protagonist cry for another girl, every episode. Heart strings weren&#039;t pulled with the first victims, or the MC getting bullied when he tried to slice off relationships with his sharpened edge, they won&#039;t be pulled from the generic cast of people. Simply put; enjoyment comes from the event of happily watching students kill themselves off one by one.<br />
<br />
Overall : 1/10<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Conclusion :<br />
Unless you&#039;re an avid fan of killing games, and had already seen the standard &quot;Danganronpa&quot; or &quot;Mirai Nikki&quot; and every single other main-stream classroom killings shows, and REALLY don&#039;t want to get into reading other gory stuff, since reading is too comprehensive for your massive head, go ahead and watch this. Be sure to unplug your head before doing so, or else all the plot-holes and stupid choices make you regret living, like your parents telling you you&#039;re adopted, or a terrible hangover.<br />
<br />
<br />
tl;dr<br />
Story - Interesting foundation, poor execution, wrong cast. 4/10<br />
Art - As good any recent animations can offer. 6/10<br />
Sound - ruined by the repetitive screeches of protesters in the ele-- 3/10<br />
Character - no development, lackluster subchars, and 0 iq mc -- 1/10<br />
Enjoyment - wow, whatever can they do next? 2/10<br />
Overall - One stroke up, Diagonal stroke, another Stroke up, circle. 1/10<br />
Conclusion - watch other similar, and decently executed shows, or turn off your brain and enjoy.<br />
<br />

    The worst anime I&#039;ve ever watched.<br />
A complete waste of my time yet I still finished it (how and why is still beyond me)<br />
The story is awful, there is no overall meaning just death, blood, screams and then it may come as surprise (oh wait it isn&#039;t)....DEATH.<br />
The art was decent not the best, but decent I give it that.<br />
I couldn&#039;t find myself sympathizing to any of the characters except for one little fella with four-legs that has approximately 5 seconds of screen time. <br />
I should have put 1 on the enjoyment, but I suppose that the fact I finished it would mean something kept me in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335047">
        front of the screen ( again it&#039;s beyond me why I lasted till the end).<br />
I&#039;ll not comment on the end, because it had no value, no meaning and the last hint about continuation of the series made the last patience cells in my head explode. I remember slamming my laptop shut and spending 20 minutes reflecting on why I wasted two days of my life watching this.....s**t.

The 1# worst anime on my lost by far , idk why my friends enjoyed watchig this sad excuse of an anime -_- , i guess it apeals for people who don&#039;t care about neither the characters or the story.<br />
Now i only watched 6 episodes but I wad already at my limit and i only kept on going because i wanted to see if it could get any worse....and to no one&#039;s surprise it did.<br />
Just save yourself the trouble of watching it.<br />

On the other hand it provides some unintentional laughs and rhe characters die in pretty

    Ousama-Game is a horror anime from 2017 based off of a novel. It was adapted by Seven. The studio that did Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san and nothing else I&#039;ve ever seen. And that was an anime I rather enjoyed. So, maybe there&#039;s hope for some quality here. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open with our so-called protagonist Kanazawa Nobuaki, transferring to a new school. It doesn&#039;t take long for his entire class to get a message on their phone that says they&#039;re all part of the king&#039;s game and failure to follow orders will result in punishment. This puts his entire class in a situation where failure to follow orders

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361209">
        results in horrific deaths. The twist? Nobuaki played the same game at his old school, and was the sole survivor. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the biggest narrative issue with the series. It basically tries to cover everything Nobuaki&#039;s old class went through with flashbacks while also going through everything his current class is. Which basically means we have about sixty characters, a whole slew of gruesome deaths and twelve episodes to cover everything. You can probably surmise from that that the pacing is rubbish. The series is very much one that throws out things like atmosphere, tension, and good storytelling in favour of sensationalised violence. The story is pretty nonsensical as well with the nature of the force behind the king&#039;s game being really stupid. And there&#039;s a pretty significant plot hole when you find out how Nobuaki&#039;s last game ended. It&#039;s like the writer forgot what happened at the start of the story when writing that part and no one could be bothered to edit this utter shite. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Just last week I praised Yakusoku no Neverland for putting time and effort into properly introducing their characters so you could get some investment and actually feel a sense of tension when they&#039;re put into danger. Here, we have the exact opposite. We have a huge number of completely one note, uninteresting or outright obnoxious characters getting killed off very quickly. When watching this I see messages flash about some character or other dying and more often than not I don&#039;t even know who they are and can&#039;t recall if they&#039;ve actually had a single line of dialogue. That&#039;s how much these characters are nothing. <br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t help when the &quot;most developed&quot; characters like Nobuaki or Natsuko are completely unlikeable and annoying. Or that the antagonist has no real motivation or character whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
This series has the same underlying issue with the art as Elfen Lied. The gore, violence and sexual content are so overblown, trashy and frequent that they lose all impact very quickly. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting in this is really terrible. I don&#039;t blame the actors, to be clear. They have some amazing talent like Horie Yui and Miyano Mamoru. The problem is that everyone in this overacts like hell. Miyano screams his lines like he&#039;s trying to wreck his throat or maybe he thinks he&#039;s Sean Cassidy and he&#039;s trying to make his powers work. You would not believe this is the same guy who voiced Yagami Light, Kiba or Okabe Rintarou. The music is pretty bad as well, but probably the least terrible part of the series. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t any. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Take some time, develop your characters strongly and then start getting a body count. That seems kind of obvious because no one is going to give a shit about any of these characters as written but given this series spectacularly fails at the basics, I&#039;ve got to point it out. <br />
<br />
2. Have some kind of reasoning behind your supernatural menace. A great example of how to do this right is the novel, The Ring. It featured a supernatural curse but it was a curse with some twisted logic behind it. Instead of just nonsense. <br />
<br />
3. Have some subtlety. Horror doesn&#039;t work well when it comes out into the spotlight to do a little dance for you. It works well when it creeps around in the shadows giving you slight glimpses and you suspect it might come out and lunge at you but you don&#039;t know when or how. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
This is one of the worst horror works I&#039;ve ever seen, read or heard. It might be slightly less bad than Elfen Lied, solely because Elfen Lied had a lot more substantial plot problems. But you could also say it was more ambitious. This one isn&#039;t really trying to do anything clever. It&#039;s just a slasher film where the slasher attacks people with an invisible force over text messages. If all you want in your horror is a high body count and lots of bloody scenes, you might actually enjoy this. If you want passable writing, atmosphere, tension, characters or acting this doesn&#039;t deliver at all. My final rating is going to be a 1/10.
