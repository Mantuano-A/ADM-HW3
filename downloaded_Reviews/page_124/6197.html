These premature assessments are commonly made when shows like this are perceived as simple fetish material, framed as horribly misplaced criticisms that leave Citrus in an undeservedly contemptuous light; as a guilty pleasure unworthy of further analysis or appraisal. Citrus is not mere fetish material, does not promote or romanticize sexual assault, and provides layered and well-developed characters whose actions are realistically influenced by both internal and external conflicts. A bittersweet feeling perpetuates as we follow naive teenagers consistently characterized as those who are lost and confused, behaving in ways that are less than ideal, but are hurdles along the way of a gripping and emotionally compelling tale that is certainly rough around the edges, but well worth the ride.<br />
<br />
There’s a common conjecture about Citrus saying that it treats sexual assault as a form of love and the blossoming romance is in the form of Stockholm syndrome, neither of which are true in the slightest. Firstly, while the actions of Mei Aihara undeniably walk on the borderline of sexual assault, none of these instances are framed as romantic or mutual in any way. The first of these depicts Yuzu struggling while Mei lashes out her aggression. Following this is a low shot with Mei, spitefully uttering “that’s what it felt like” in response to Yuzu’s innocent curiosity about Mei’s romantic affair. Nothing about this is painted in a positive, approving light. Subsequent events like this are blatantly shown to be a byproduct of Mei’s misconception of how relationships work, or a means to vent her frustration. The sheer discomfort is emphasized through both the cinematography and the expressions of the characters involved. This does not mean nefarious actions like these are excused, as the story never does. Yuzu always retaliates to these actions once she regains control over herself during these events. Depiction and endorsement are not the same thing, a fact that should always be considered with regards to a story like this. Another thing to address is this: the assaults are by no means the foundation of the leads’ romance, and that is a myth that should have passed long after this show had aired. Yuzu develops feelings for Mei long before the first assault occurs, which is most evident during the scene where she is lost in thought about witnessing Mei being kissed by Amamiya. Her focus is squarely on Mei’s behavior and what kissing must feel like for her, with Yuzu’s own attraction to Mei not even apparent to her. Overall, when proper attention is brought to the characters’ actions as well as the framing, it becomes clear that the criticism of Citrus romanticizing assault holds no truth whatsoever. I&#039;d like to make a point here that not all opinions are equal, and opinions on Citrus based on the conception that it romanticizes or normalizes assault and abuse are invalid and therefore wrong. A valid opinion doesn&#039;t require high intelligence or sophisticated taste or anything like that. It requires a correct interpretation of the content, one that is often not taken through first impressions or face value.<br />
<br />
Citrus and its content is highly reliant on context and characterization. Just as these confused adolescents struggle to understand each other and themselves, wondering who and what to believe, viewers are left on their own to base judgement on characters’ behavior and what they say, save for some frequent monologuing by Yuzu. And even then, her own thoughts aren’t always reliable. Content that comes off as questionable or discomforting to certain viewers is perfectly explainable through indirect characterization, a method of storytelling that challenges the brain beyond just relying on narration and monologues to provide answers without viewer effort. Viewers share frustration and confusion with the characters themselves, and the payoff is all the more rewarding because of this. The character Mei Aihara exemplifies this most of all, as she is a person whose subtle mannerisms bring light to a personality misshapen by the worst of circumstances, and very applicable to reality.<br />
<br />
Mei is a character with practically no conception of right and wrong, let alone the idea of consent, and has never been shown, or had any experience of, what a true romantic relationship is like. The only proper relationship she has ever had in life was with her father. After he left, Mei felt as if she was being abandoned by the only one she was ever truly close to. It’s clear that prior to where the main story begins, Mei has had no emotional support ever since her father’s absence. She is used and neglected by her grandfather, is constantly taken advantage of by her fiancée, and is under perpetual social pressure to follow her duties accordingly for days on end. <br />
<br />
As a result, Mei’s attitude towards romantic and sexual relationships is completely distorted. Her one and only understanding of love relationships is through physical contact, of which she uses to control people just as she has been controlled herself. This is symptomatic of being in a sexually abusive relationship like she had with her first fiancée; she doesn’t value her own body and is incapable of interacting with people normally. In many situations, whether it&#039;s a love relationship or otherwise, Mei passively accepts everything that is piled on her with no concern for her own well being, a trait that is consistently apparent over the course of the story. On the other end, her way of taking control of situations is her sexual advances towards Yuzu, who understandably objects to these actions. The main point is that Mei only acts in the way she knows how. This conflict of hers isn’t a singular matter, but numerous elements about her past and how she was raised which come together creating the version of Mei we see throughout the story. Mei is depraved, misguided, and some could even say mentally ill. And again, none of these elements are used to justify Mei&#039;s behavior. It&#039;s merely a case of cause and effect, one which leaves morality out of the question entirely.<br />
<br />
Being so used to her strict upbringing, Mei frames every scenario as a bargain or exchange rather than a desire, even if she doesn&#039;t necessarily intend it. Her feeling obligated to follow in the footsteps of her father to gain his affection encapsulates this quite well. Having received no unconditional love since her father’s disappearance, this is the way of thinking which governs almost all of the decisions she makes. For this reason, she’s perplexed as to why Yuzu bothers to do all these unconditional favors. The answer to this is simple: Yuzu cares about Mei. Unconditional love is a foreign concept to Mei, and this trait continues to subconsciously affect her even long after she has experienced the true virtues of a genuine human relationship. (*cue the beginning of episode 10*)<br />
<br />
The psychology of Mei is one of the main things which the story lives through, and is one of Citrus&#039; most fascinating aspects. As frustrating as her actions can be at times, the consistency of her character and the relatability of her plight makes her highly sympathetic, and as such Yuzu’s efforts to make things right for her, however reckless and brash, are very admirable. When you consider everything I&#039;ve previously stated, it turns out that Mei has every reason to act and behave the way she does. Her attitude and behavior are both realistic and morbidly consistent when acknowledging this perpetual turmoil she lives through.<br />
<br />
Mei’s problematic, manipulative behavior is not only addressed as such, but is also a conflict in itself. Discomforting scenes that people insist to be mere sleaze and titillation always leaves a negative effect on characters involved. Mei’s first assault turned Yuzu’s pending lust for and curiosity of Mei into a maelstrom of confusion and hysteria. Repetition of these acts behind the scenes gave us Mei Aihara as we know her. A certain character who does this to another results in the victim avoiding that character extensively.<br />
<br />
The way Mei gradually becomes more open to Yuzu about her feelings and personal issues, is a cathartic and satisfying affair in and of itself, and it’s kept at natural pace throughout. Not only this, her behavior changes for the better the longer she spends time with Yuzu. Little by little she displays improvement and development as she makes decisions of her own, acting beyond her mental protocol. It’s rather easy to see why Yuzu is in love with Mei, besides her beauty and status. Hiding behind this cold exterior is a frightened and lonely young girl that Yuzu wishes to nurture and protect.<br />
<br />
What’s truly commendable, however, is how many instances of her development are deliberately presented for us to infer on our own, rather than being told directly and explicitly. Here’s one particular example of this:<br />
<br />
<br />
**SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 7 AND 8 BEGIN HERE**<br />
.<br />
.<br />
The moment Mei truly develops romantic feelings for Yuzu is at the end of episode 6, and the exact moment she realizes these feelings is episode 7 when Matsuri forcibly kisses Yuzu out in the open. This is all indicated through her sudden change in behavior compared to before. She is now less grim in her expressions around Yuzu, and looks slightly more sentimental. Her actions convey this even further, such as the way she compliments Yuzu for the meal that was made. The day after that, Matsuri is shown to be envious of Mei continually deriving attention from Yuzu at the expense of Matsuri’s, causing her to shove off. This causes Mei to feel guilty, having created distance between Yuzu and one of her closest friends. This is where she first experiences the baggage that comes from being in love.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
**SPOILERS END HERE**<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason this works in service to the narrative is so viewers are put into the perspective of Yuzu herself. She struggles to understand Mei, using signs in her behavior to understand what she feels. Mei is deliberately presented just as enigmatically as she is to everyone else.<br />
<br />
With so much about Mei already covered, it’s only fair that the other heroine, Yuzu, is given the same treatment. Yuzu at the start has an idealistic view of the life that lies before her. She acts with unrelenting confidence in almost all occasions, expecting everything to go smoothly and perfectly in line with what she envisions. I think I speak for most people when I say that when we were young teenagers, our ways of thinking were hardly any different. We’ve had strong ambitions of our own, believing we could achieve them all without entirely knowing the reality of certain situations. Of course, like most teenagers, the decisions that Yuzu makes are not always wise. Quite rarely so, in fact. She often does things, with or without good intentions, unperturbed by any potential consequences they could raise. Her greeting with the chairman is a particularly good example of this. Having become a new addition to his family, she approaches him expecting to be welcomed with open arms. Instead she’s scolded for her meddlesome behavior and unruly fashion choices.<br />
<br />
On the flipside, while she makes unwise decisions, Yuzu is not completely unintelligent. She shows a degree of rational thinking alongside her impulsive behavior, which is an important distinction from a character who is near hopeless in their stupidity. Yuzu eventually does mature past her idealism yet retains an optimistic outlook which drives her to do better in her more realistic pursuits. Yuzu is shown throughout the story to be a very capable individual thrusted into situations she’s unprepared for, often falling back to impulses or superficial goals. Despite this, she’s quick to bounce back and make things right through the best of her abilities, learning from past mistakes and focusing on what matters most in the long run.<br />
<br />
One of Yuzu’s strongest and most prominent traits is how empathetic she is. While she’s often self-absorbed in her appearance and overall image, she’s quick to understand others and wants to be on good terms with those around her. She’s the type of friend who would listen to your problems, forgive you for whatever quarrel you had with her, and be willing to keep any reasonable promise you ask of her. Amidst a locale of people’s misdeeds and the oppressive dominion that is her school, Yuzu is someone who is incredibly easy to root for and would be an overall great person to hang out with. It’s easy to see why Harumin became friends with her so quickly, and also why Mei eventually fell for her.<br />
<br />
While Yuzu is a highly good-hearted individual, to say she’s only ever kind and generous sells her personality woefully short. She can be irritable, snarky, jealous, and is overall more insecure than she lets on, using Harumin as an emotional crutch when she finds herself in a quandary. She often lets these emotions get the better of her, as teens typically do. The bubbly, boisterous personality of Yuzu, while oftentimes funny and endearing, can also come off as irksome and frustrating. Rather than being portrayed as an all-loving angel, Yuzu is a lovably flawed individual with a good heart and poor self-control. Compiling all these traits together results in one of the most compelling, lovable, sympathetic, and relatable main leads I’ve come across in all media.<br />
<br />
As for her relationship with Mei, Yuzu is on a constant struggle to comprehend her feelings. She knows that something is amiss about Mei, invoking a feeling of concern. At other times, she wonders if what she does hurts Mei more than it helps. This confusion is a result of their inability to communicate with each other effectively and coherently, mimicking typical romance between teenagers more than people seem to realize. Yuzu doesn’t understand Mei, and by extension doesn’t know how to act around her. The two of them had been raised in completely different conditions, and thus operate and communicate differently from one another.<br />
<br />
It’s obvious that Yuzu has an unfaltering love for Mei, but one obstacle she must overcome is resisting the urge to give in to her superficial desires, and pursuing what is realistically best for Mei in the long run. At one point her only choice is to put her love for Mei aside and to treat her as a sister. Although she does all these things selflessly she still has a degree of self-preservation, in stark contrast to Mei. What Citrus does well is distinguishing the superficial aspects of love from the emotional aspects. Crushes aren’t developed through logic, and our own real life experiences prove as much. What this series explores is the multitude of consequences that come with loving someone. In this case, it’s dealing with the complications of being in a love relationship with your step-sister.<br />
<br />
Differentiating perceptions of love are what pervade a majority of the cast in Citrus. The students at Aihara Academy all knowingly grew up in an environment where sexual experimentation is a normality. Of course I can’t speak from experience, but to my knowledge this mimics reality in Japan. Referred to as Class S, it’s common for girls in school to have crushes on other female classmates, forming bonds with them. These bonds could be described as romantic, but the sexual aspect of the attraction is out of the equation entirely, assuming they’re straight. It’s telling that a Japanese audience would have a far better understanding of this kind of story, and the positive reception of Citrus in Japan compared to the west is evidence of this.<br />
<br />
Harumin really emulates this concept more than the others. She is essentially a direct foil to Yuzu in how sexual relationships are perceived. For Harumin, particular actions between couples are a source of curiosity. By contrast, Yuzu thinks about what these actions mean for the relationship. The most obvious example is arguably when the two eavesdrop on Amamiya’s phone call. However, one other particular moment drives this home more than any other. Harumin discovers the yuri incest manga Yuzu was reading. Fascinated, she puts herself in a scissoring position with Yuzu. She’s so confident in her heterosexuality that doing this means nothing to her. Yuzu on the other hand recognizes this as an expression of love, and thus is highly discomforted by this scenario. This is largely presented as a comedy moment, but it does a lot to signify the differences in their characterization. It also benefits in a way from being depicted in such an over-the-top manner.<br />
<br />
Harumin acts as a companion to Yuzu all the way through to the end, but in reality she isn’t able to truly understand what Yuzu is going through, regardless of how much she thinks she does. This is also the reason Yuzu decides to take on these tasks by herself, because she’s the only one who truly understands. We can also assume that she keeps it to herself in fear that Harumin wouldn’t accept her for being in such a taboo relationship. After all, this is why she keeps it a secret to Matsuri and anyone else outside the school campus.<br />
<br />
Moving on from the characters, I bear no hesitation saying that the plot of Citrus is undoubtedly its weakest aspect. Although the events it strings together can catch viewers off-guard, maintaining a dash of unpredictability in the whole adventure, it all too often relies on contrivances. Coincidences in fictional stories aren’t inherently a bad thing. The coincidental reveal of Mei as Yuzu’s new sister is rather far-fetched, but it&#039;s tolerable enough to leave investment unimpeded. However, the numerous contrivances beyond this point become harder and harder to swallow as they come by. The way that some situations are arbitrarily resolved through circumstance, rather than on behalf of a character, doesn’t do the plot much favors either.<br />
<br />
A widely-used, yet reasonable, complaint about Citrus is its continuous introduction of characters to move the plot along. The way I see it, this is at least as much a problem with the pacing than the actual inclusion of these characters. When these subplots are coupled with Yuzu and Mei’s progressing relationship, then focus becomes a problem here. Tone shifts are frequent and occasionally jarring as a result of having to constantly switch priorities. The interpersonal affairs between Yuzu and Mei are heartfelt and down to earth, whereas dramatic confrontations with outsiders are tense, frantic, and somewhat theatrical. When meaningful interaction between Yuzu and Mei is abruptly followed by these sideplots, that can challenge one’s ability to stay invested in either plot.<br />
<br />
However, while pacing and tone is certainly an issue here, to say that these subplots serve no purpose is untrue. Each story arc in Citrus presents a barrier in Mei’s psyche which is resolved with every passing conclusion. Every resolve is satisfying in its own right as it brings Mei further out of her shell whilst bringing her and Yuzu closer together. It’s apparent that new characters are introduced to fill a certain role in these affairs, but the focus on Yuzu and Mei is unrelenting and the characters serve their purpose quite well. To start with, Himeko &quot;Twindrills&quot; Momokino at first appears to be quite the villain, but she actually shares traits with both Yuzu and Mei, and even has strikingly similar motivations. Like Yuzu, she has an unfaltering love for Mei, arguably in a “romantic friendship” sort of way as opposed to sexual attraction, and goes to great lengths to claim her affection. Like Mei, she is both dedicated to her job and remarkably strict with school regulations. Her intentions are what make her a rival to Yuzu, and then later bring them to a resolve. They wish the best for Mei, but are oblivious to her true feelings. Matsuri is a character acting as a parallel to Mei. Only instead of closing herself off, she seeks attention. In the worst ways. Her rebellious nature and sinister antics make her a worthy addition to the cast. It’s not done just for the sake of it though. It’s a situation where Mei sees her own self and is willing to make amends for someone Yuzu is close to.<br />
<br />
The arc with the Tachibana sisters is considered by many to be the weakest arc in the series, and I am no exception. While it serves its purpose well and the payoff is rewarding, it isn’t put together nearly as well as the others. I think what it sets out to do doesn’t warrant new characters to be introduced into the middle of the whole dilemma where their intrusion can be seen as more frustrating than serviceable, especially when those characters lack depth. The situation between Mei and Yuzu at this point is already complicated as it is, so piling more characters on top of these complications is more of an annoyance than anything else. I think other less irritating methods would have served the function of this arc quite well without having to bring the sisters into the mix. It also doesn’t help that in this arc, conveniences pile up even more than in any other, even attempting to sidestep this with “fate” and “destiny.”<br />
<br />
As I said before though, the payoff is largely worth it in the end. It’s not necessarily a case where the abundant problems in this arc can be forgotten, but rather forgiven. This arc is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great story overall.<br />
<br />
The dialogue of Citrus is also worth commenting on. It’s no Shakespearean writing, but it feels natural and works in service to whatever is going on. The characters’ lines are filled with personality and subtext which makes conversations feel alive. Characters are also quick to point out irony in another’s lines, making the exchanges even more human. Certain moments in dialogue are quite significant and memorable for how expressive they are and how it piles emotion into the situation. The scene where Mei and Yuzu are on a bench on a cold winter day is a good example.<br />
<br />
With all that said, I think it’s finally time to traverse into how Citrus fares in the audio/visual department. Regarding the visual front of the Citrus anime adaptation, it’s an overall solid effort, albeit with a moderate amount to be desired. Obviously it would be unreasonable to expect the level of quality in the manga’s art to be fully translated into a costly animated product, especially with a studio like Passione. To compensate for this, the adaptation uses character models that are simplified versions of the exquisitely drawn renditions in the manga, and does so successfully. These character models would’ve been a satisfactory page-to-screen translation if not for one caveat: one of the main things which I believe gave the manga so much of its charm and made it so appealing to many, was how expressive the characters are. Characters, especially Yuzu, would regularly emote and make different facial expressions for many situations. This also happens to the anime to some degree, but not frequently enough to where it captures the manga’s original charm. It’s much rarer in the anime for characters to deviate from their default expressions, making the experience somewhat more sterile. Perhaps this was to cut down on budget costs, or it was a design choice on behalf of the director. Whatever the case, it’s a compromise which I can only feel detracts from the viewing experience. Manga and anime are different mediums, so of course compromises should be expected. But various scenes only stood to lose by omitting so much of the vibrance the characters displayed. Even the many chibi moments in the manga wouldn’t need to be adapted, as simply varying the facial expressions of the characters would be enough. Anime-only viewers probably won’t see this as a huge problem, as it’s rarely a sheer detriment to the visuals (save for a few lamentable instances). Scenes between characters are delivered well and there is plenty of emotion to be found in the visuals. The problem is that the adaptation, by not harnessing the kind of quality seen in the manga, wastes its potential as an adaptation and as an animated product. As it stands, it could be a hell of a lot worse, but it also could have been a lot better.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the animation quality is a department that ranges between average to well above average. There are various moments where I was very impressed by the animation, such as certain comedy moments, intimate scenes, emotional engagements, and characters’ body language. But there are also a select few times where I was dumbfounded by just how low the quality could really get. Overall it’s a pretty decently animated show with some flukes here and there, and thankfully it can only improve with the BDs. One of the fronts I was most impressed by in this adaption was the soundtrack. It genuinely surprised me with how good the music was in this adaptation. Using a mixture of graceful orchestral performances with vivacious electronic beats, the music of Citrus is vibrant, diverse, and well-suited for the exuberant and bittersweet tones that the story delivers.<br />
<br />
What’s lacking most of all in the visuals is the background art, a case where access to technology seems to have expended a team’s creativity. Several shots will display setpieces with little to no detail or texturing. Perfect cuboids and stainless steel populate much of this world. This is most prevalent in Yuzu’s own house, with walls that are solid colors and doors looking less like wood and more like metal. The school grounds also display a disgustingly high amount of textureless objects, falling short of selling this environment as something that could exist in the real world. This is not even mentioning the many issues with lighting, of which environments are either evenly lit or disregard physics altogether. One shot in particular takes place under a night sky with a lamp post in the left, yet with shadows directly underneath every object. What’s frustrating is that this shot looks great in about every other aspect, from coloring to composition, and falls short of perfection thanks to the team not willing to amend such a simple yet glaring issue.<br />
<br />
This also extends to background characters, which often consist of CG models walking awkwardly and robotically. Once this is noticed, it’s impossible to ignore, and immersion struggles to stay in tact. All of this is the mark of a bare minimum effort on the part of Passione, and fans of the source material aren’t nearly as scrutinous of this as they damn well should be. Incompetent decisions like these are one of the main reasons we as anime fans are so desperate for ideal adaptations of the manga and novels we dearly love.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the shoddy effort in the backgrounds is alleviated through great shot composition and luscious color directing, for which we have director Takeo Takahashi to thank. This is a director who excels at visual storytelling and framing, emphasizing certain moods when applicable. Climactic scenes are sold effectively through this as well as character animations which, as previously stated, are well-done when they really need to be. This adaptation of Citrus is overall very well-directed, save for the aforementioned faults in production which Takeo should have been more mindful of. In an ideal world, the production of Citrus would be on par with Hanasaku Iroha, a show that I hold as a high standard for animated melodrama. The end result here is not without its faults, but is a satisfactory effort all things considered.<br />
<br />
So that concludes my review of Citrus. The story at large is quite rough around the edges with its frequent use of coincidences. It’s also arguably flawed in how many things are framed as a formulaic routine. With a new girl continually intruding on the situation, it’s admittedly easy to feel some degree of frustration. The core story however, with the two main leads, remains very strong. Various facets of their character are explored well and brought to a satisfying resolve. That said, there are many loose ends in the story yet to be tied up, in which case I can only hope a second season will be made eventually to adapt the rest of the source material to complement the anime-viewing experience. All things considered, however, Citrus is a great anime overall. One of the things which motivated me to write this review was to address the criticisms this show had been receiving. If you have already seen this anime, and anything I’ve said gave you something to think about, then perhaps it deserves a second viewing. For a show so widely shunned as being a lesbian fanservice show, the story of Citrus is one that anyone, gay or straight, male or female, can relate to on any level.

    Tinseltown has been coming under fire as of late. Celebrities&#039; misdeeds are being exposed publicly on a weekly basis like a new sporting event. The #MeToo movement giving a platform to voice sex scandals that have gone unnoticed for far too long. Scrolling through your timeline, plastered on the TV screen, announced over the radio during daily commutes, the subject matter of countless memes, the focal point of water-cooler conversations; no matter where you turn, there it is. Accusation after accusation. Transforming popular figures into pervert pariahs overnight. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Brett Ratner, James Woods, Bryan Singer, Casey

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277747">
        Affleck; an endless potpourri of bigwigs—the 21st Century witch hunt in full swing. No one is safe. <br />
<br />
And while all of this is going on, halfway across the globe, there&#039;s Citrus, minding its own business as it idly trolls along turning sexual assault into a provocative byproduct of step-sisters &quot;bickering.&quot; While people are pooling together with torches and pitchforks in hand, shining a light on any sexual misconduct occurring in the dark recesses of the entertainment industry, Studio Passione persists with the biggest &quot;whatever bro&quot; shoulder shrug. What the rest of the world concerns itself with isn&#039;t going to stop them from showing girls casually molesting each other on their scheduled programming. It&#039;s actually pretty impressive. Fucked up, but impressive nonetheless. I guess you could extend that sentiment to Japan in general. Creating &quot;fucked up shit&quot; in a carefree manner has become something like their calling card:<br />
<br />
Has mass shootings and domestic terrorism been a hot-button issue? Well here, have some Inuyashiki. Concerned with gender politics? Don&#039;t worry, we got you covered with Skirt no Naka wa Kedamono Deshita. &quot;If you want it, we got it.&quot; seems to be the motto, as they peddle anything and everything in the endless pursuit of creative freedom. Which brings us to the latest foray into the &quot;fucked up shit&quot; unofficial canon, Citrus. <br />
<br />
From the land that gave us distinct high-school dramas like Orange, we&#039;re handed Citrus, the undesirable fruit.<br />
<br />
The anime tells the tale of– oh, who are we kidding? It&#039;s about sexy-time with female characters. It&#039;s all lip service unless it &quot;services the lips&quot; of the females involved.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s pretty average-looking too, the ugly kind of average-looking.<br />
<br />
Hoards of CGI models in green linen jackets. Flat buildings without detail, walls bare of personality. Real-life-inspired locations washed of any distinct features. Stainless steel structures, straight shapes stretching on endlessly without purpose, without care. Floorboards and walkways copied and pasted into an endless loop of lethargic worldbuilding. A kind of artificial sheen to everything. Devoid of human touch, the undeniable look of computer-generated polish. Clinically sterile and evenly lit. The feeling of being done to the bare minimum. Uninspired. Uncaring. Unconcerned with anything unless it&#039;s &quot;sexy-time,&quot; and even then, it&#039;s barely a passing grade. <br />
<br />
Everyone has dark hair and moves forward in a unified step as if puppets to their boring world. A lifeless march towards an all-girl school, a place where our Yuzu would be attending. Yuzu Aihara is the rowdy rebel, our ball of &quot;life&quot; in a world lacking it, and unfortunately our main lead as well. The unlikable side character in any other show given a chance to take center stage to problematic results. Makeup caked on, strawberry blonde hair puffed up, cleavage out in the sun, skirt hacked up, buttermilk tan, all manner of frilly things, school outfit altered beyond recognition, a personality as loud as her appearance; a self-proclaimed gyaru and a shameless attention-seeker at that—this is &quot;much deep&quot; cuz spunky gurl in a world of conformists.<br />
<br />
And standing as her polar opposite, there&#039;s Mei Aihara, a soon-to-be molester dressed up as a Mary Sue. She suffers heavily from PerfectGirl-syndrome: honor-role pupil, top of her class, student council president, poised, admired by everyone, the chairman&#039;s granddaughter, built like a walkway model, good at literally everything she does. She probably farts out Chanel No. 5 too. You get the drill, she&#039;s as interesting as wallpaper. Perfect to a sickening degree. Well, that&#039;s all before she decided to turn her new step-sister, Ms. Rowdy Rebel, into her personal play-thing.<br />
<br />
And who better to bring this together than Takeo Takahashi, a man that&#039;s equally known for his hentai contributions as he is his &quot;safe for work&quot; content. <br />
<br />
Citrus certainly has that kind of attribute to it. That sort of sleazy undercurrent that flows throughout every moment, well-intention or otherwise. Camera-panning that ogles the female form without concern for respecting boundaries. Narrative threads meant to help audiences relate to the cast quickly expedited to get to the next sexual encounter. Endless monologues for every characters&#039; dilemma—subtlety isn&#039;t allowed in this universe. A sense of objectification, even if it&#039;s in regards to actions expressed with consent. Nothing is ever pure. Everything smeared with the fingerprints of hedonistic high-gloss. <br />
<br />
Even smut like 2017&#039;s Scum&#039;s Wish, at the very least, had small spurts of respect displayed for its cast, occasionally loosening its vice grip to allow a chance to express feelings openly. By comparison, everything in Citrus feels bought off. An act of slave-like procurement over the characters&#039; bodies that&#039;s too readily apparent to ignore. Awkward half-chubs spurred on by involuntary stimuli. In a meta-sense, we&#039;re also made victims of visual misconduct (go figure). It&#039;s the kind of eroticism that arrives quickly and leaves you feeling dirty. <br />
<br />
An anime that will have a heated shower scene where non-consensual groping occurs, then follow it up with this dialogue exchange:<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;–Yuzu pushes away in abject horror– &quot;Why are you doing this!?&quot;–her eyes closed, as she stands there naked and vulnerable.<br />
Mei innocently answers back without hesitation, a tone of motherly matter-of-factness:<br />
&quot;Because you looked like you wanted me to touch you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scene ends, never to properly address the disturbing exchange again. <br />
As long as the money shot was secured and a few man-tents were pitched, nothing else matters. <br />
This is the kind of &quot;feeling dirty&quot; I&#039;m referring to. <br />
<br />
I love perverted content as much as the next guy, but sometimes, what Citrus attempts to do is genuinely off-putting. Sexual harassment shouldn&#039;t be confused with love. And if it is, a level of accountability needs to be put in place to avoid idealistic handwaving. But this is a show that thinks that if it holds a &quot;this is wrong&quot; PSA after it indulges in sexual misconduct, that it&#039;s suddenly not culpable of wrongdoing. An anime that sells Stockholm syndrome as a shot of Cupid&#039;s arrow. Where fighting sexual harassment with sexual harassment is treated as an actual solution. Serious issues trivialized to create marketable eroticism and comedic gags.<br />
<br />
Any act of earnestness is completely lost in a title devoid of finesse. After a while, you sort of just roll with it. Jokes at the expense of serious issues. Illogical reasoning made by characters to justify their actions. You might even buy into the lack of audiovisual effort as a part of the &quot;theme&quot; to contrast everything against Yuzu&#039;s personality. Of course, you&#039;ll be wrong, as even her living quarters and look has been rendered flaccid, lacking in any sense of creative vitality or noticeable effort. It&#039;s all very surface-level. Pedestrian sleaze that isn&#039;t arousing enough to keep the Kleenex nearby nor respectful enough to genuinely stimulate discussions regarding the content on display. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s perhaps this show&#039;s biggest downfall in a nutshell: it&#039;s vanilla, but a souring type of vanilla. <br />
<br />
A type of middling existence occupied by works of far more distinction than itself. If you&#039;re interested in the taboo themes that this anime addresses, there&#039;s no need to compromise with inferior goods to get your fix. There are better alternatives out there for those actually seeking integrity (Koi Kaze) or far more titillating eye-candy (Scum&#039;s Wish). Why settle for vanilla in a world full of flavor just waiting to be discovered? Is Citrus entertaining? Sure, at times. But when 17-minutes of content is glazed over just for 3-minutes of &quot;sexy-time,&quot; and the &quot;sexy-time&quot; itself is neither well-animated or concerned with addressing the elephant in the room that surrounds its content; at that point, what you&#039;re left with is a show whose sole purpose for existing is left dead in the water from the moment it dives in.

    Citrus challenges today&#039;s anime standards by introducing interesting topics like &quot;How cringy can character dialogue become in an anime until I drop it?&quot; and &quot;Is it sexual assault if I kiss my step sister without consent...and get away with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is by far the worst anime I&#039;ve seen this year and I&#039;m just 4 episodes in. Dialogue doesn&#039;t feel natural at all, exposition is thrown in my face every second and characters don&#039;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
The pacing of Citrus is way too fast and we never get any real sense of knowing how to feel about a moment. There is a scene where Mei kisses

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269905">
        her sister in the first epiosde without her consent and it feels super uncomfortable but next episode, the main character pretends like this thing was super romantic, not literally, but this is what it feels like.<br />
<br />
Animation is also something we should talk about. It commendable that the director actually changes the clothes of the main character multiple times, which isn&#039;t done as often as you might think, but the actual animation is piss poor and the art still suffers from time to time. It&#039;s also sad that nothing about this animation seems to have any personality.<br />
<br />
Now on to the topic of Gay bait. Is this show some gay bait for people that browse through tumblr and twitter 24/7? Yes. Yes it is. Instead of developing a genuine, natural romance between two highschool students that happen to be girls, we get some of the most rapey, uncomfortable Yuri scenes I had the displeasure to watch. It is amazing how people are willing to justify abusive and toxic romance as long as it&#039;s gay.<br />
<br />
If you want to watch a shitty gay Telenovela in anime form, then boy, is Citrus the anime for you.

    Some spectators consider themselves sophisticated, modern and avant-garde. However, when they become aware of some social taboos, they change their mind and create a disapproval towards some topics. One example, the lesbian romance. Citrus has potential but fails with some distasteful scenes as described below. <br />
<br />
The Ugly: The story mistake love with rape and forces affection from a lame sexual assault. In this world, Weinstein’s behavior would be considered romantic and not the act of a sick predator.<br />
<br />
The Good: As the plot progress you can observe the protagonists’ insecurity, problems, and feelings. <br />
<br />
The Bad: Unrealistic begin. Some characters are not well developed because the time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274772">
        is not enough to let them grow.<br />
<br />
Citrus introduces a homosexual storyline where we can see a lesbian nexus, yet you don’t need to fear it. No matter your gender, you can enjoy some parts of the narrative. The plot isn’t as bad as some writers want us to believe, but it’s not surprising either. Besides, the series begins with some weird and awkward moments that sink the possibility of a good romance, and I consider them fictional and unrealistic. On the other hand, Citrus emphasize the inexperience and the doubts in a relationship and tries to establish a link between the protagonists. In some scenes, you can sense the character’s feelings. Sadly, in this modern era the taboo persists, perhaps for a woman, it is easier to tolerate this type of bond. Finally, Citrus is a Yuri anime, if you cannot bear this kind of affinity, it is better to stand aside and ignore the adaptation, or you might end up disappointed.  <br />
<br />
The story<br />
<br />
The story isn’t as marvelous as you can expect, the author sometimes mistakes rape with love, though. Also, the only way explored to conceive the romance is through the physical force. For example, it is ridiculous comparing intimacy with a sexual assault under the diplomatic motto “since I love you, I can obligate you to adore me.” In a real world, this concept will be judged as rude and out of place, it will generate repulsion, a restriction order and could end with a visit to the jail. Those actions could lead the spectator to misinterpret the characters’ feelings and leaves the personal problems, fears, doubts, the lack of experience, and psychological aspects in the missing objects box. In the case of Yuzu, she does not know how to approach Mei, so the storyteller merely throws her over Mei literally, and the latter doesn’t hesitate to assault Yuzu. Can you accept it as a romance? Furthermore, this keeps happening during all the adaptation. If you read the manga, those scenes aren’t intrusive, you can pass them faster but in the anime the director focus and prolong them. Call it fanservice, hentai or sexual harassment; it does not fit the feeling setting momentum.<br />

In addition, this erroneous idea creates a false meaning of a lesbian link. From my perspective, a lesbian is like a straight; the relationship rules are alike. Why does the author use a weird and a wrong approach to initiate the attraction? Thus far, the plot fails on producing a good start for the romantic connection, it just leads the characters to a forced rape, deceiving the spectators with a cheap and fake drama.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the narration improves as it advances. I am not considering Citrus as a masterpiece, but the progression is acceptable. As the series continues, we can observe the inexperience of a usual acquaintance, the doubts, the pain, the suffering of the protagonists delivering the audience a better development and a different perspective. While the story picks up, it still has some defects such as the recurrent fanservice. If the social taboos do not slant the viewer, you could enjoy Citrus, though.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the lack of sense at the beginning ruins the possibility of a more vibrant narrative, a palpable romance and leads to the audience’s boredom. Going further, you can notice some pacing problems. You need to be honest with yourself because some characters were just placed to fill a scene. The casual spectator will only watch the first episodes and decide if skipping the show. Since the issues appear from the start, Citrus will be readily considered a bit grotesque, a raw passion and a potential drop.<br />
<br />
Finally, the overused sexual assault as a “comedy” (for some) or as a “romance” change the plot and the enjoyment. If you can survive those scenes, you can see the character’s authentic feelings. Honestly, I like Citrus manga, but the anime has been highly criticized by some unpleasant development that leads to a different meaning. In conclusion, you cannot compare intimacy with ravishment, and you cannot exploit the sexual assault to propel a romantic or comedic moment. For some viewers that scenes show affection, for others is a rape. In my case, SOME are sexual abuse and unnecessary. Lastly, the twelve episodes present a portion of the story and not all the published material and the most significant parts of the series still on the source.<br />
<br />
The characters<br />
<br />
Yuzu. In the beginning, she displays some atypical feelings for Mei. Since she has no experience in love or relationships, she could fool the viewers with her naivety, show an emptiness and a similarity with a mundane generic girl. However, as the story progresses, we can see her emotions, problems and real doubts.<br />
<br />
Mei. Some can judge her as a cold and expressionless robot. Since she is the school president, she might look strong. Nevertheless, inside she is baffled and seeks to follow her dad’s steps. She will give up everything to keep alive her family legacy and traditions. Also, she cannot communicate her emotions and has vast inexperience in the relationship area. Thus, always leads her to mistake love with sexual assault or perhaps she just enjoys doing that. <br />
<br />
Matsuri. I consider her introduction misplaced. From nowhere she arrives and creates some problems just because Mei needs an opponent. Her feelings for Yuzu are vaguely explained.<br />
<br />
Sara: Added in a similar way to Matsuri but her nature is the opposite. She is Yuzu’s rival, and her sentiments appear almost instantly. <br />
The rest of the characters help the narrative progression such as Harumi and Himeko. <br />
<br />
The art and sound<br />
<br />
Technically speaking, Citrus has a beautiful animation, clean and fluid with excellent drawings catching your attention. Despite the plot issues, you will enjoy it. The camera angles and planes blend well with the narrative and the emotions; they focus on the details. One negative aspect, the unnecessary fanservice scenes. You could misinterpret them and will sink the real story.<br />
The series has good sound. They give us a remarkable OP and ED. Honestly, I like the OP, the tune and rhythm combined with the lyrics create a fabulous composition. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Citrus isn’t an anime for all tastes. The social taboo may make the observer indispose from the beginning. However, after some episodes, the story improves, and you can feel some character’s emotions. I like some aspects of the plot. It isn’t perfect and has a weird unrealistic start letting you with a big question mark, “is it going to be worth my time?” Thus, in combination with the “sexual assault” scenes could lead your apathetic side and make you drop the series. Finally, the manga is superior. It shows a significant evolution with better pacing. I understand, sometimes most of the spectators avoid this genre, but if you reached this point of my review, perhaps you could watch the anime and read the source to feel Yuzu’s emotions in a more desirable approach. I wanted to give Citrus a high score my conviction prevents me. I cannot accept the constant use of a sexual assault as a romantic or comedic filler that impacts the plot negatively. As I said, Citrus isn’t for all the tastes. <br />
<br />
Lastly and talking in general, you need to be broad-minded and don’t bury a show just for a sexual preference. You can criticize but don’t stigmatize the lesbian topic. If you dislike the story, skip it.<br />

    If I got a dollar every time this show featured a kiss scene, I’d probably be filthy rich now. No, not really but you have to admit, there’s almost an absurd amount of kissing in this show known as “Citrus”. To me, this show is a modern example of a trashy soap opera made with the intention of cash grab. <br />
<br />
Adapted by the manga of the same name, Citrus is one of the few series in recent years that decided to take on the idea of lesbianism and turn it into a modern day drama. In anime form, it’s defined more as yuri/shoujo-ai. As someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274788">
        who has read parts of the manga, Citrus focuses on the concept of female relationships. Unfortunately, I can’t really express any hope after reading the manga. This anime adaptation set off red flags from the start and isn’t able to fix them. It’s a shame really. <br />
<br />
Diving into this show may feel a little uncomfortable at first if you’re not used to this type of genre. The first few episodes makes it clear that there’s more going on between main characters Yuzu and Mei. Although they don’t have similar personalities, it’s shown that Yuzu feels an uneasy attraction towards Mei after getting into some compromising positions with her. Throughout the show, the both of them engage in many activities that adheres to lesbianism. The anime doesn’t hide the fact that there’s seems to be mutual attraction as each episode ventures on. Other characters gets involved in their story but the main focus is on this pair. And to be honest, it feels pretty embarrassing to watch. The show tries to be a love story but instead filled with laughably bad dialogue and clichés. I also can’t remember the number of times I shook my head at how their relationship developed. That’s actually what holds the show back a lot. Relationship dynamics in Citrus dances with an immense amount of teenage feelings and attempts to make it seem complicated. However, it ends up being washed up with little value and doesn’t seem to know what to make of its characters. <br />
<br />
Individually, Yuzu and Mei aren’t actually bad characters. At least from a realistic point of view, Yuzu is a normal girl who wants to explore romance and grow up. She’s also a bit of a daredevil and isn’t afraid to speak her mind or help others when in need. On the other hand, there’s Mei with a personality as cold as the snow. My impression of Mei is someone who would be incredibly difficult to be friends with. Her values are high standard and she never seems to let people get close to her, with perhaps the exception of Yuzu. We also get some background story about the two characters in later episodes to make viewers understand them more. However, that’s pretty much the extent of it. Yuzu and Mei are basically carrying this show while other characters are hardly worth talking about. I mean, there’s Yuzu’s best friend Himeko but she gets annoying every time her mouth opens. Harumi Taniguchi’s borderline obsession with Mei is incredibly obnoxious to watch. Oh and who can forget about Matsuri? It seems the show tries to make the audience hate her as much as possible. The Tachibana sisters introduced in later episodes are hardly likable either with their oddball personalities. The point is, most of these characters are one dimensional and hardly develops. In fact, I would say the characterization in this show really shoots itself in the foot with how certain episodes conclude. And that’s too bad really.<br />
<br />
Besides the characters and story, it seems Citrus loves to service the fans. While it’s not as explicit as some scenes in the manga, there’s quite a bit of kissing in the show. If you fancy make out scenes and yuri fan service, then this might be the type of show for you. I’m not going to lie though, it can be a bit of guilty pleasure at times. However, it gets tedious fast and after you’ve seen it a dozen times, it almost feels senseless. That being said, Citrus does do what it’s intended to do: bring out teenage feelings from characters and making a trite soap opera out of it.<br />
<br />
If there’s one thing to smile upon Citrus, it would definitely be the visual quality. To put it simply, the show is vibrant, colorful, and is full of life. The character designs are attractive and really enhances the feminine charms of the cast such as Yuzu and the Tachibana sisters. The way characters expresses their emotions is also highlighted through the choreography that’s hard to ignore. In many ways, the technical quality of Citrus is a sight for eyes to feast on. Whether it’s the fan service or characters themselves, it’s definitely there to impress.<br />
<br />
There’s not too much to go on about soundtrack as both theme songs gets its point across with the teenage drama style performance. However, the character voice mannerism is what makes some of the characters feel consistent with their roles. Yuzu is the most prominent example as she often speaks her mind and has a voice to match with her personality. Mei has a much colder voice tone that reflects her reserved persona. However, there’s also other characters that I can hardly stand whenever they speak. In particular, Matsuri’s voice sounds like she’s a 12 year old. Get ready for the ear plugs…<br />
<br />
By the time I finished Citrus, I had to question myself why the anime is even called that. The literal definition of Citrus is a type of fruit that has somewhat of a sweet and bitter flavor. Does that stand as a personification of the show’s themes? Who knows but I honestly find this show more than just bittersweet. What could have been a chance to make monumental history turned into a sour experience. <br />

    Potential spoilers for the manga below...<br />
<br />
First - ignore all the hate directed at Citrus online. Give it a chance and make up your own mind. Other reviews and discussions will mock you for enjoying something they call trashy and melodramatic. They mock you for being entertained by something they have deemed so basic and depraved. And yet, after you&#039;ve watched a few episodes you&#039;re thinking, &#039;why do I like this so much and why do I want to see more if everyone says this is garbage?&#039;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s because Saburouta is punching WAY above her weight on Citrus. It&#039;s like someone took Jane Austen and plonked her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273041">
        down in modern day Japan and asked her to write a yuri manga. Yes, the very thing that all those haters will mock you for seeing in Citrus that they claim doesn&#039;t actually exist - the excellent writing, the deep character development, the touching emotional content - really is there, and it&#039;s been written quite purposefully and skillfully.<br />
<br />
To begin, let&#039;s put aside that this is yuri for the moment. Yes, you know it is, I know it is, everyone knows it is. But the point of Citrus is absolutely not the fact that it&#039;s yuri. Saburouta could have written this story with two asexually reproducing spores as the main characters and it would have been equally as compelling. The fact that it&#039;s yuri is not implicitly fan-service, and if you&#039;ve read the manga you will know that Saburouta dishes out the fan service in such tiny servings as to lack any nourishment whatsoever. More on why this is an issue in a moment. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get the other elephant in the room out of the way - the non-consensual sexual content in the first episodes/manga issues. Remember that this is a work of fiction and the reader is not meant to condone or approve of the actions of any of the characters. This is the classic dramatic question of, &quot;is evil something you are or something you do?&quot; To begin with, Mei has been taken advantage of, used, and basically treated like an automaton by dear old gramps ever since her Dad left (we&#039;ll get to that later). At the beginning of the story, there is no Mei - there is just a robot that does what needs to be done in the name of the Aihara family. She has no mother, no father, and the only affection she has ever known has been the cruel affection of the jerk teacher that she was arranged to marry even though he was planning on leaving her once he had the academy. She has literally never had a proper emotional relationship with anyone, and all she understands is the use of physical affection as a means of controlling others, as she has been controlled herself. But yes, you say, Mei should know better. She should know the difference between right and wrong! Oh really? Who taught Mei right from wrong? That&#039;s right, no one! She&#039;s acting out the only way she knows how. And, by the end of episode nine after the run-in with Matsuri - shock of all shocks, Mei has learned right from wrong because never again in the entire series do we see Mei act this way. And guess who teaches Mei wrong from right by her actions - Yuzu does.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d also like to address the actions of Matsuri that a lot of people have a problem with - don&#039;t forget that Matsuri is just a kid. Remember being a kid? Remember how bad your judgement was, and how you did a lot of stupid things that people called you out for? Again, you say, Matsuri should know right from wrong. But again, who taught her right from wrong - her workaholic, absent parents? Right. Matsuri isn&#039;t capable of understanding the consequences of her actions, something that Yuzu points out to her several times. &quot;Relationships are not a game&quot; and &quot;love does not come as easily as it does in a manga&quot; says Yuzu to Matsuri. Matsuri is similar to Mei (as Mei informs her on the train, and why Mei forgives Matsuri so easily) in that Matsuri is literally a kid alone in the world. But instead of closing herself off to the rest of the world like Mei did, Matsuri sought out attention - the bad kind - online with her &quot;clients&quot;. Mei isn&#039;t joking or being self-sacrificing when she tells Yuzu &quot;that girls needs you&quot;. Mei understands more than anyone, despite Matsuri&#039;s actions, that Matsuri needs a source of goodness and love in her life. This is why Mei says that Yuzu is &quot;one of those meddlesome people who give you love even though you didn&#039;t ask for it&quot;. By the end of episode nine, Matsuri has very subtly grown as a person and again, never does any of that bad stuff again for the rest of the series (so far). <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get to the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. They are, quite literally and figuratively, the yin to the other&#039;s yang. And let&#039;s get one thing out of the way right now - Mei and Yuzu are as gay as the day is long from the outset. This is why I said this story could have been about two asexually reproducing spores - the fact that they are gay has nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing to do with this story. Why do I say this? Because neither Yuzu or Mei are struggling with their sexuality, ever. Being gay is so natural to them that they never question it. Need proof? Remember the scene where Yuzu is reading the sister manga, and Harumin (who wins as best friend in a manga/anime ever btw) suddenly scissors her. Yuzu *freaks out* and Harumin says &quot;this book shows positions for two women&quot;. Why is Harumin so casual and Yuzu so freaked out? Because to Harumin, that position means literally nothing other than a curiousity - Harumin is so confident in her heterosexuality that she can do that without worrying what it means. Yuzu, on the other hand, is mortified because scissoring means something completely different to her - it means an expression of love, an expression of love she one days hopes to share with Mei. Which is what makes it such an uncomfortable situation with Harumin, for whom she has only a friendship type of love.<br />
<br />
And Mei, well, Mei is just super gay. And this is where Citrus is worth a deeper look and a rewatch or two. The thing you need to know about Mei is that she falls for Yuzu *for real* in episode eight. You know after Yuzu takes Mei to say goodbye to her father, Shou? After Mei sees Matsuri awkwardly kissing Yuzu in the street? Yeah - right there. That&#039;s where Mei falls for Yuzu. The cute little finger twidding scene with her stuffed bear followed by the passionate hug of Yuzu - right there. And here&#039;s where the central conflict of the series begins: Mei simultaneously loves Yuzu but also wants to push Yuzu away because of all the baggage that comes with loving Yuzu. Mei is pissed off with herself for being in love with Yuzu, and every interaction for the rest of the anime/manga is an expression of the internal love/hate that Mei has for Yuzu. This is what makes the story so bittersweet - we love Yuzu, Yuzu wants Mei to love her, Mei wants to love Yuzu, we want Mei to love Yuzu, but....Mei just can&#039;t allow herself to do that. If you&#039;ve ever been in a similar situation, you know what&#039;s up.  <br />
<br />
But back to the gayness. Saburouta never asks us to question that they are gay, as is the case with most &quot;will they or won&#039;t they&quot; yuri - we are meant to accept it as easily as the both of them do. So Saburouta has taken the standard yuri trope and cast it aside.<br />
<br />
I believe that Saburouta very purposely drew Mei and Yuzu as lesbians from the outset for the very reason that this anime/manga is getting so much hate - she wanted to remove the ability of the audience to fetishize the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. For the typical yuri audience, this is anathema - it defies the whole reason they read yuri in the first place. Citrus is, as its core, a very cute and bittersweet love story that most people - gay, straight, or otherwise, can relate to. <br />
<br />
In Yuzu, Saburouta has created one of the most likeable, and dare I say loveable characters in manga/anime. Yes, her earnestness and plucky, can-do, kampai attitude is a standard trope, but there is way more to her than that. She actually shares a lot with Mei and Matsuri, parental attentiveness-wise. Her Mom is cool but absent, and new Dad Shou literally married her Mom just so that Mei would have a place to live away from gramps and he&#039;s off who-knows-where-doing-who-knows-what. The very first scene of the anime/manga is Yuzu hanging out with the slutty mean girls doing the teen-sex-talk thing. Yuzu desperately wants to belong somewhere, even if it is pretending and exaggerating with the nasty gyarus. She is the light to Mei&#039;s dark, again, literally and figuratively. Where Yuzu is overflowing with kindness, love, goodness, and understanding, Mei is a completely dark and vacant empty vessel. Over the series, you watch as Yuzu&#039;s love flows into Mei and completely changes her. But what about Mei, what does Mei do for Yuzu? Let&#039;s face it - Yuzu is a scatterbrained airhead. She acts without thinking, she has very little personal discipline, and would be distracted by a squirrel playing outside the window. For Yuzu, Mei is a much-needed reality check. When Yuzu is off floating around in teddy bear clouds, Mei is the one who is there to make sure her feet don&#039;t get out beyond reach. And Yuzu realizes this and also changes her behavior to be a more diligent student (with mixed results). The two of them are inextricably intertwined and their lives cannot be complete - at all - without the other.<br />
<br />
This is why Citrus, and Saburouta, are absolute genius. The subtlety, the way that you can go back and rewatch past episodes re-read past chapters with present knowledge to unlock the motivations of the characters is brilliant.

     I will write my review shortly, just read and thinking.<br />
 I don&#039;t know, the way how people think about this anime, but i love it, very much. I&#039;ve been waiting this anime show up for years. And buuf, it show up, and you couldn&#039;t know how happy i was, so i come to this website, see people leave reviews here.<br />
 Some person &quot;very&quot; do not like this anime, and they said this is HOMO, oh wow, now life is very very modern and i don&#039;t think we &quot;need&quot; to hate the LGBT, they&#039;re human? right? Like we? so why we need to hate them?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270200">
        If you don&#039;t like this, you can absolutely stop watching this anime, and watch some &quot;excellent&quot; harem anime like you love.<br />
 You really really don&#039;t need to leave some &quot;negative&quot; reviews. That&#039;s all, thanks for spend some minutes to read :D<br />
 Whatever, i love this anime very much &gt;w&lt;

    Please note this review is intended for those that have already finished watching Citrus and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. <br />

When sisters meet unexpected sparks fly and an unlikely romance blossoms <br />
<br />
Based off a popular manga series of the same name Citrus is a Shoujo and romance anime that takes place within a school setting and gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you not only find yourself welcoming in a stepsister into your family from your mothers new marriage but also the actions that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274780">
        can happen if you were to fall in love with the stepsister that you just welcomed into your family. While Shoujo animes aren’t usually a genre that I&#039;m really interested in when looking at the premise as well as the background source material that it makes use of I felt that the series itself certainly sounded interesting. Interesting enough in that I decided to give the series a chance. The first episode of the series I felt did a great job of introducing both the setting of the series which is the school and of the two main characters Yuzu and Mei. In particular, I felt that the sense of rivalry that developed between them from that moment was interesting considering how later events would play out. Looking back, I&#039;m glad that I decided to give this series a chance as the series was one that I really enjoyed. <br />
<br />
The overall story of the series takes place at a famous and popular all-girls school situated in Tokyo that is well known for is strictness and conservative nature and follows the life of Yuzu Aihara a newly transferred student that moved to the city to join her recently remarried mother. As Yuzu, a fashionable and fun-loving girl transfers to the school and encounters the conservative and strict nature of the school she encounters the schools beautiful but strict student council president Mei Aihara who whether through fate or destiny is also Yuzu’s new stepsister. While clashing with Mei both in school and at home Yuzu soon learns that attraction and hatred just like love and hate are two sides of the same coin. As Yuzu and Mei clash with each other they also start to learn more about each other and slowly but surely the two start to bond and get closer with each other and slowly cross the line that divides the sisters and become something more. While slowly bonding with her new stepsister Yuzu as she gets used to both the school and the city also meets and makes a number of new friends while also encountering ones from her past. These include the arrogant but understanding student council vice president Himeko, the cunning and deceptive Junior high school student Matsuri and the Tachibana sisters Sara and Nina who while having differing personalities also have a close and loving bond between them. The overall story of the series covers roughly the first four volumes of the source material. <br />
<br />
Yuzu <br />
<br />
Yuzu Aihara played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu of Sao and Youkoso fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A bright, fashionable and fun-loving girl by nature Yuzu at the beginning of the series was a newly transferred student that had just moved to the area to live with her mother who had remarried. While carefree and positive Yuzu was also someone that had a lot of self-confidence but did not let that make her arrogant and instead was something of a free spirit being both positive and friendly to everyone that she meets. As a result of these traits Yuzu was someone that was able to make friends easily and in this, it can be seen that she’s someone that’s very loyal to her friends and would work hard to help them and support them when they need help while hating it when she is unable to help them. While relaxed and carefree by nature it can be seen that Yuzu is also someone that can get serious at times especially with regards to helping her friends with their problems a side of her that I felt was a great contrast to her relaxed nature and fitted well with the two sides concepts that the series makes use off. In line with Yuzu’s carefree and free spirit type personality Yuzu is also someone that is noted to hate being constrained by rules especially those that restrict in how she should dress. This stems mainly from the fact that Yuzu is someone that believes that it’s the right of high school girls to be able to dress and act the way that they want in order to take advantage of their youth and any rules that prevent that will only be a bad thing for them. In line with this aspect of her personality Yuzu while mostly being someone that prefers to not stand out is also someone that’s also bold enough to make her views on subjects that concern her known even if she was to face censure when doing so. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and as Yuzu gets to both know Mei better and encounter and befriend more characters in the school Yuzu’s personality gradually starts to change as she finds her life becoming more intertwined with that of Mei. At the beginning of the series Yuzu while carefree was also someone that was rather stubborn with her beliefs and often had arguments with people that had different views to her. As the series progresses this side of her personality gradually changes, and Yuzu begins to show more consideration to others while trying to rein in her more brash behaviour and try to think of the consequences of an action before doing them. This change is best shown in Yuzu’s willingness to admit her own mistakes and attempts to take responsibly for her actions and any effects that it had whether on the school or her friends. At the beginning of the series, Yuzu and Mei did not have the best of relationships or the best of first encounters and it can be said that their first feelings on meeting each other as sisters for the first time was hated and dislike rather than happiness and joy that would be the expected. Unlike Yuzu’s carefree and freethinking nature that values independence Mei’s personality, in the beginning, was the complete opposite being rule-bound, and strict which Yuzu applied to both Mei and her family. As the series goes on and they get to know each other more this feeling of antagonism gradually softens, and Yuzu starts seeing and treating Mei as family. As the series goes and Yuzu gets to see and understand the pain that exists within Mei she becomes somewhat determined to break through the shell of sadness that Mei has erected around herself fighting hard to get through to the real Mei that was behind it in a determined attempt to give her what she had craved the most in her life which was love and a place where she can belong too. As a result of this journey, the bond between the two gradually grows deeper as Mei slowly opens herself up to Yuzu’s determined attempts to help her and in the process creating a deeper relationship between the two that Yuzu never expected. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. Its been a while since I had seen Ayana Taketatsu in a lead role, but I felt that she did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yuzu. <br />
<br />
Mei <br />
<br />
Mei Aihara voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tsuda of Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series. The new stepsister to Yuzu Mei’s personality and attitude is markedly different from Yuzu in more ways than one. An attractive and intelligent girl by nature Mei is the very image of a cool beauty that deals with every situation with calm and logical solutions that hint at her level-headed nature. A quiet and composed girl Mei is someone that believes fervently that rules are the very pillars of society and that without it society would only be in chaos. This is a belief that Mei believes greatly and tries to inspire the students of her school in her capacity as student council president. While a quiet girl by nature Mei, however, is not unsociable and indeed while most people assume that she’s rather aloof the truth of the matter is that Mei can also be friendly to those that she has befriended and can be surprisingly understanding of others while being courteous and polite to those that she doesn’t yet know. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that Mei is someone that’s very hardworking and takes her duty as student council president seriously. Indeed, she is the type of person that would try to do everything by herself and be unwilling to bother others with it even if it was their role to help in the first place which shows her dutiful and determined nature. To many of the students that she manages Mei is someone that is cool, level-headed and efficient that makes it hard for them to approach however the reality of this is that Mei while certainly cool and efficient is also someone that remembers those that have helped her in some way a side of her that I really liked.  <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and more of Mei’s personality is revealed beneath the calm and composed attitude that she projects to her fellow students Mei is, in fact, someone that lives in constant pain and isolation and is someone that doesn’t trust others easily. Rather it can be seen that Mei is someone that tries to push those that try to know her away. As a result of having lived alone for much of her life in the beginning of the series it can be seen that Mei like Yuzu needed time to get used to the fact that they now had a much larger family than before and while the relationship between Mei and Yuzu and her mother was somewhat distant at first this gradually changed as the series went on in line with the deepening bond that is forged between them. While hinted on in the beginning as the series progressed it become apparent that Mei’s relationship with her family was rather strained and while she feels indebted to her grandfather who had raised her this also acted as a constraint for her life as well as it limited the freedom that she could have within her life. However arguably the main issue that had caused Mei’s heart to be constrained was, without doubt, the strained relationship that she had with her father which caused her to work fiercely to protect the school even to the point of causing her life to become nothing more than a set of performances. After making peace with her father and fixing this Mei’s attitude gradually began to soften and she begins to break out of her shell and not just be more open with her feelings but also learn to place her trust in others more. At the beginning of the series, Mei’s relationship with Yuzu was that of wariness which was somewhat understandable and kept her distance from her. But as the series progressed on and she gets to see and understand Yuzu’s personality a bit more this began to change. After overcoming many challenges together Mei’s attitude towards Yuzu begins to change becoming more positive and open-minded and less formal in her dealings with Yuzu showing the improving bond between them. While still retaining some of her aloof nature Mei’s personality gradually begins to thaw and begins showing her more honest and warmer feelings towards Yuzu openly unlike before. The character of Mei was an interesting one as her personality while contrasting greatly with that of Yuzu was the result of problems that was caused by family-related issues that ended up constraining her life which I felt was appropriate as it matched well with the theme of family and bonding by breaking through the wall that someone has erected to protect and hide them. I felt that her seiyuu Minami Tsuda did an excellent job in portraying the character of Mei. <br />
<br />
Matsuri <br />
<br />
Matsuri Mizusawa voiced by veteran seiyuu Shiori Izawa of Asterisk wars fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is an old friend of Yuzu. A 2nd-year junior high school student Matsuri at the beginning of the series behaved somewhat like an old friend to Yuzu being overly attached to her while still maintaining an innocent charm that was unique to her. On the surface, Matsuri was a kind, caring and polite person that seemed to value friendships and bonds. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and more of Matsuri’s personality is revealed it can be seen that beneath this surface Matsuri’s personality is very different. Beneath her surface personality, it can be seen that Matsuri is someone that is cunning, manipulative, and deceitful and will use every available means to get ahead of others as long as victory is hers. In addition, Matsuri has also shown to be rather possessive of things that are considered dear to her such as her role as Yuzu’s little sister. At the beginning of the series, Matsuri was shown to have a rather warped view of what friendships and indeed what a relationship is as she took neither of them seriously and viewed them as something akin to a game. In this, she treated both as something that she can take advantage off to allow her to survive in society while at the same time pushing away things like love and warmth that is a result of the relationships that can form between friends. In a way, Matsuri’s personality, in the beginning, was very much like what Mei had been experiencing at the beginning of the series. As the series progresses and Matsuri see’s the depth of the relationship that exists between Yuzu and Mei and after seeing the truth of what she was missing Matsuri’s personality gradually starts to change becoming friendlier and more open with her feelings while trying to understand what real friendship is by forming her first real friendships with others. <br />
<br />
Himeko <br />
<br />
Himeko Momokino voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kobo of Youkoso and Seiren fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A member of an upper-class family on account of her impressive and elegant hairstyle and the shops that she frequents Himeko true to her status is a self-confident, determined and somewhat stubborn person by nature that serves as one of the school’s vice presidents and as a result assists Mei in her duties as student council president. A childhood of Mei Himeko is someone that while arrogant is also someone that believes in rules and order and would often pursue rule breakers with vengeance which is often used for comical effort within the series. While arrogant and confident in herself Himeko is also someone that cares deeply about her friends and can be quite perceptive when it comes to sensing when something is bothering them.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the series, Himeko had an antagonist like relationship with Yuzu as the latter seemed to enjoy breaking the very same rules that Himeko see’s as important to both the school and herself. As the series goes on and Himeko’s personality is gradually revealed it can be seen that Himeko’s feelings towards Mei go beyond that of what can be considered a simple friendship. In fact, it can be seen that Himeko has a lot of pride in serving as not just Mei’s vice president but also her oldest friend as well something she uses often when she and Yuzu face off. While Yuzu and Himeko remain rivals for Mei’s affections as the series goes on it can be seen that both share the same concern for Mei as each other and indeed when it comes to Mei’s well being it can be seen that both would drop their rivalry to help her when needed something that I felt was nicely done.  <br />
<br />
Nina <br />
<br />
Nina Tachibana voiced by Rei Matsuzaki is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Yuzu’s friends that she encounters while on a school excursion to Kyoto. A high school girl from another area Nina is the younger among the Tachibana sisters and very different in attitude to her sister. A kind, caring and intelligent girl Nina unlike her sister has a rather laid-back personality and is the kind of person that will not worry needlessly about things that have already happened. True to her laid-back personality Nina is also someone that is really forgetful as well. Nina’s most prominent trait is without a doubt her tall physical height which I find to be pretty surprising for a high school girl.  Despite Nina’s laid-back personality, it can be seen that Nina has a very deep bond with her sister and is very loyal to her to the point that she’s willing to act as the villain if it means that her sister is able to have happiness. <br />
<br />
Sara <br />
<br />
Sara Tachibana voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Food Wars and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Yuzu’s friends having met and befriended her when they met in Kyoto. A high school girl from another high school Sara is the elder of the Tachibana sisters. A cheerful, positive and considerate person by nature Sara is someone that unlike her sister Nina is someone that prefers to not waste time pondering on something and prefers to strike it out in one-go kinda like a boxer and as a result is also a bold, brave and determined person. While bold and daring Sara is also someone that’s perceptive of others feelings and is the kind of person that will let go of something if it would help others despite the pain that she will feel showing off her good nature. Because of this, however, Sara Is shown to have a dislike for people that give up too easily as she feels that if you don’t go all the way then all you did was take half steps that ended up creating nothing. <br />

AMV <br />
<br />
The animation for the series I felt was pretty well done with both the school and the uniforms for it being both well designed and detailed. The character designs for the series main characters I felt were also well done and were faithful to the source material to which I&#039;m thankful. Music wise the series OST as well as the opening and ending themes I felt were excellent and did a great job at conveying the different emotions and feelings that each scene featured. Voice acting wise I felt that the main cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In particular, I felt that Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Yurika Kubo did a fantastic job of portraying their respective characters. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
Overall Citrus was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points were its premise, story, characters, animation and voice acting and its unique use of romantic relationships to heal the hole that had formed within someone’s heart. The main premise of the show naturally is the encounter between Yuzu and Mei after Yuzu moves to the city and the subsequent escalating relationship that they forge between them. The decision to make an all-girls school as the series main setting I thought was an interesting move as though increasingly rare in this day and age single gender girls have the ability to create unique environments that can have the effect of both providing an effective place for students to learn and progress but at the same time trap them beneath layers of responsibility. One of the main themes that the story makes use off is that of the relationships that a family can have and the effect that this can have on members of that family. The decision to make use of the stepsister concept an idea unique to parents that have remarried I felt was a move well done as it not only gave the pretence for Yuzu to move to Tokyo to join her mother but also meet her new stepsister Mei as well. While Yuzu and Mei may not have had the best of first encounters watching the two of them try and come to terms with one another’s existence within their lives was interesting as until they met each other each had thought that they were alone within the family. This gradual process of getting used to being sisters contrasted well with the romantic aspect of the show. The romantic aspect of the show I felt also did a great job at making use of this theme of family as while developing feelings for each other Yuzu and Mei also in the process started to explore the many wishes, desires and restrictions and responsibilities that lay within them that stopped them from achieving the things that they desire. This exchange of feelings as with everything is two sides of the same coin and just as Mei is able to see the hesitation that lay within Yuzu she too is able to see the many problems that Mei hides within her heart problems caused by both a carefree father and an overbearing grandfather that when combined with the school almost suffocates Mei in responsibility and trapping her real feelings in a place where few can reach. The desire of Yuzu to both understand and open up Mei’s closed off heart and expose her true feelings I thought was a great use of the family theme as it provided the perfect key to open up Mei’s closed off heart and provide her with the very thing that she was missing in her life which was that of family warmth. <br />
<br />
Overall Citrus was an interesting anime that made use of an interesting premise and a unique way of forging a romantic relationship that can be used to open someone’s closed off heart while simultaneously reminding us that while society can be a harsh place trying to take too much responsibility by yourself and not letting others see your true feelings can be a bad thing. Sometimes its worth it to maybe stop one day and have one long talk with someone that you trust and not hide them anymore. In terms of final score, I think Citrus certainly deserves a score of 10/10. <br />

    If you&#039;re a queer woman looking into this anime and hoping for some decent representation like queer men got with Yuri on Ice!, then I would suggest not even watching the first episode of this, because it&#039;s not just a disappointment, it&#039;s a goddamn disgrace. <br />
<br />
Just the first episode alone contains multiple scenes of sexual harassment and assault, and even worse, the way they&#039;re played off is always either comedic or fetishized! (Not to mention that the two main characters are step-sisters, which makes all of this even more disgusting). I didn&#039;t expect much from this show, considering all I&#039;d heard about it was from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270438">
        male yuri fans who also thought &quot;Sakura Trick&quot; was good, but trust me, this went even lower than I thought it would.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a wlw, especially if you&#039;re a young one and don&#039;t know what unhealthy relationships look like yet, I warn you to steer clear of this show.<br />
<br />
However, if you&#039;re a non-LGBT person who likes to fetishize gay people like the disgusting excuse of a human being you are, then you&#039;ll probably enjoy this. <br />

    I just love how people always react in such manner regarding Yuri anime, like, the same people who would be supportive regarding this plot if it was Yaoi, but it&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
I understand people who haven&#039;t read the manga to be shocked by the first episode and just be like &#039;&#039;wtf is going on&#039;&#039; but I don&#039;t understand the hate you&#039;d be giving the anime when you&#039;re not even trying to give it a shot, writing a big review, trying to look as educated as possible when you only saw one episode, or even just two.<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime is really fun and good in my opinion and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270016">
        yes, it&#039;ll not change your life completely unless you take some courage from the characters about coming out one day.<br />
<br />
I might be daring to say that I like the plot, I like how everything develops, I like the music so much, I like the art too, I think it&#039;ll only get better and I am ready for it. People get triggered by some of the &#039;&#039;forced&#039;&#039; kiss which I understand, but it&#039;s not really how it seems and it gets less crazy and it&#039;s worth enduring, although I didn&#039;t view at as forced because *spoiler ahead*<br />
<br />
[spoiler]They really are into each other/like each other &amp; they&#039;ll obviously end up being the OTP.[/spoiler]<br />
<br />
*spoiler is kind of done*<br />
<br />
<br />
Would I show this to my family?<br />
<br />
Hell no, they&#039;re homophobic. <br />
<br />
Even if they&#039;re not and it was a straight anime having two people kissing in it, I wouldn&#039;t either, too embarrassing. But I&#039;d def watch this with an open minded friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like this because it&#039;s modern. <br />
I like this because it&#039;s gay.<br />
I like this because it has development in it.<br />
I like this because it makes me also smile, seeing the tiniest of representation in the anime community about us, makes me happy. <br />
I love that we&#039;re getting more Yuri and I hope people bear with it and see that it&#039;s not really as bad as the first episode made it seem.<br />
It&#039;s just a bit daring, to say the least. <br />
<br />

    Ive watched 12 episodes of this anime, I have calculated every single angle and aspect of this anime ranging from the story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment and from this I have deduced that the main character may or may not be a lesbian. Fuk this doGshit anime<br />
<br />
Texual Evidence: In the intro, features 2 girls, Mei and YuzuBitch kissing and that was my first clue to this claim that they may be lesbian. My second piece of texual evidence was from the christmas when Mei tried to s8x with YuzuBitch but to my displeasement they did not have fuck so Im not sure if they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367721">
        are lesbians at this point. <br />
<br />
Counter Claim: Some may argue that they are in fact lesbians but according to my calculations it does not seem this way because they did not have fuk. <br />
<br />
Overall: I will have to write this anime a 2/10 because i am clueless as to whewther they are gay or what. <br />
<br />
Highly Recommand.

    It&#039;s still pretty early which is why this isn&#039;t much of a review yet as it&#039;s more of a first impression for the people interested. <br />
<br />
The reason I&#039;m writing this is because I&#039;m really satisfied with how well the adaptation came out. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;ll evaluate it as an anime not as an adaptation but I just want to say that it really stood out to me how the anime made the setting pop out more than what the manga did. I never really felt the surroundings in the manga and I&#039;m really glad with this since it holds an importance in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269834">
        show. It also stays faithful to the source material as of now but again, it&#039;s still too early to end it there. <br />
<br />
<br />
To begin, this show is about romance. Lesbian romance. <br />
<br />
Now with this kind of stories, people like me usually watch it for the sexual fantasy and stuff. It&#039;s more about the characters so It doesn&#039;t really need to have a mind bending plot. It does have some sensitive themes if that concerns you. With that said, it does a good job on executing it&#039;s story. <br />
<br />
We have this girl; Yuzu, who is very enthusiastic about being a gal and even lies about having boyfriends to her friends but she gets transferred to an all-girls school because her &quot;mama suddenly found a new papa.&quot; On that school she meets other characters but most importantly Mei, the intriguing student council president/grandchild of the school chairman/the betrothed in an early age character (trust me, this is not a spoiler.) They started on the wrong-foot pretty quickly because of their conflicting personalities but what they don&#039;t know is that they&#039;re connected much closer than they think. We find more and more things about Mei through Yuzu and boom, character development. <br />
<br />
It gets spicy very early but it doesn&#039;t feel rushed or forced and there&#039;s nothing I can really complain about. That&#039;s just the scenario but the pacing itself is fine along with the direction. It kinda feel like a k-drama. The use of lighting, the backgrounds, blurring or shaking camera shots, I love how they use the light behind Mei to hide her face when she stood up then showed her expression afterwards as she walks away. I can tell that the studio respects the manga and is really trying all they can to not just merely copy what&#039;s drawn in the source material. The art style really captivates me because it&#039;s not overly detailed but it looks so good. <br />
<br />
The animation isn&#039;t outstanding or anything but it doesn&#039;t have to. It&#039;s good enough for a drama show and the studio knows what it needs to emphasize. Like that scene where Mei searched for Yuzu&#039;s smartphone In Ep 1. That scene wasn&#039;t just to grab (no pun intended) attention, it&#039;s actually important because that&#039;s the reason why Mei left such a huge impression on Yuzu when they met. I really like the occational dynamic camera movement too like those in the OP. The show can look good even without that but they still went for it and that&#039;s always good to see. The music is fine but I don&#039;t have much to say about it really, there&#039;s some good ones like the one played during Yuzu&#039;s bath in Ep 1 but nothing that stands out. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure if this is helpful or anything but I like the show so far that&#039;s why I&#039;m persuading people to give it a try.

    (TLDR Review below, as always, thanks for reading)<br />
<br />
There is a distorted mindset in every corner when it comes to Citrus.<br />
<br />
It is an anime that simultaneously holds titles of being lowbrow fetish bait for those looking for none other to satisfy their lust for girls&#039; love, there is also a minority who will dismiss such perspectives as a mere defect of the cognitive thought of analysing an anime (lol). I stand between the two pillars of the bridge, or one could say that I don&#039;t even stand on the bridge at all, for in my eyes, Citrus is none other the same as any romance anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422692">
        issued to the public, the only difference is that it uses a more niche GL as a premise than the otherwise standard heterosexual relationships which usually dominates mainstream romance anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not one to entwine the ability of anime directors to supposed S-tier literature writers of the past such as Dumas and Dickens, however, I do believe that any piece of media can assume to the realm of subtle intellectual ideas ranging from a wide variety of field of studies, though, human irrationality is very much a thing that cannot be cured, and we have a tendency to think up nonsense that amasses to something that didn&#039;t exist in the first place, or such ideas that if some entity references parables and the likes it must suddenly mean said piece of fiction of the acme in a means of &quot;intelligent thinking&quot;. It is one of the reasons I am not entirely impressed with anime such as NGE because the motives of each individual can be aligned with many pieces of media of today. The only weight it holds is a class act, which, I will admit, is very praiseworthy. Maybe it is that of the subconscious seeking the enjoyment maxima, I wouldn&#039;t know, I am no psychologist.<br />
<br />
This idea to take prey for minuscule detail is one of the reasons why I didn&#039;t find any reason to &quot;overpraise&quot; Citrus as I thought I would. I did initially come into this thinking it would be a nice challenge of the mind, but as time continued, there was simply no reason for me to excessively hound down on literally oxygen particles in an attempt to praise it like some Victorian doctor receiving new evidence debunking ghosts. There just wasn&#039;t that kind of impact. However, on the flip side, as stated in the early paragraph, Citrus was bound to not only some irrational praise, but also bound to inconsistent hate, this idea that an anime can be automatically bad based on the very same premise it was proposing. I&#039;ve never liked this idea because it denies the basic creation of art rights, to limit something just because someone else may not like it. It is against creative freedom if anything. The fact that no one will take the time to look at &quot;pointless kisu-kisu scenes&quot; and then brush them off as some negative factor of the anime is nothing short of absurdity and a little hypocritical to concurrently say said thing has no value in the anime, but has value in the analysis, considering these scenes happens frequently, you&#039;d think that there is some meaning to it rather than it being there just for the &quot;fanservice&quot;.<br />
<br />
And so, with that, I bring forward what is it about Citrus that should share its place amongst the crowd as just another one of those series that comes and goes.<br />
<br />
What I really like about Citrus, and what differentiates it from the rest to give it its own name rather than solely being generic, is the idea it uses consistently. It is a tidy mess of things around this anime, with more factors being more praiseworthy than the others, but overall the writing and the presentation of such is pretty damn good. What Citrus does is that it presents different kinds of emotional conflicts between individuals in a basic, but splendid manner. Sisters being conflicted on what one thinks about the other, linearly increases acts of sexual conduct falling under forbidden acts among sisters, connections between different individuals who quake the relationship in hand. There is a lot of emotional play here, and it is written to a substantial degree. There is more intricate stuff like the kissing and what else goes on that are very interesting to understand too. As stated, I don&#039;t think it falls under zenith quality levels of works, but it is still somewhat a clever idea, which I believe falls into how one undergo the feeling of love. It is not all sunflowers, but instead, a thorny rose, if anything, it is a believable aspect, especially when going into a more controversial topic. This idea is that love is not always a walk in the park, rather, a fight against the many obstacles in the way of whomever it is one desire, a fight within oneself too. The dangerous thorns must be overcome for one to reach their glory, it is a reminiscence of the sweet, sour, and bitter tastes of the past. It is. Citrus. It is a clever idea for sure, all in all. However, one thing that annoyed me with Citrus was the layout.<br />
<br />
Now I know teenagers aren&#039;t the brightest of the bunch, we cringe at ourselves when we look back to the times of being one of the &quot;cool kidz&quot;, or how the world hated us and everything was their fault, or just actual stupid nonsense (some of which was fun to be fair). So I find no reason to dislike any of the characters here doing dumb stuff, such is a part of life. My problem is the frequency of these characters, those who come and go only exist to push the main two to the ending everyone already knows will happen. Sure, as individuals, they are cool, generic yes but that doesn&#039;t make them bad, though they cannot have a reason to exist if it wasn&#039;t for the main two. It kills humanity to them, killing any and every standalone feature, thus not having the believability in range to make them more loveable characters, one can only assess their behaviour, but otherwise, there is nothing more to them than to otherwise be the spice in the plot necessary to forward the duo to the desired outcome. I suppose that may be the role of a side character, though I&#039;ve seen side characters elsewhere who are certified for positions in making themselves their own anime because they have that kind of good character to themselves, so there is no real excuse here, in dramas at that too.<br />
<br />
I should speak of the main characters before moving to the next section too. Starting off with Yuzu, I personally enjoyed a lot about Yuzu, and I thought to myself, when the anime had ended, that she is a great character in what she does. She is a dumb teenager, who gets dragged into the perplexing pinball world of emotions, trying to find out exactly what it is she needs to do to satisfy herself, or her emotion of love. She doesn&#039;t go through the most grandiose development, but I don&#039;t think that is a means to deny her any praise, for her strength is journey altogether. Yes, nothing really changes, but actually seeing her visibly trying to understand what it is she needs to do is nothing short of a good motion in direction. She does very questionable things, but also tries to behave in a sane manner to actually understand herself, you know, the talking to others and what have you, all the while putting in the effort necessary to maintain who she is as a person, being a kind and upbeat girl. There is none of this disjointed development that literally makes zero sense. She is a character I managed to look back only positively, I really mean it, her growth isn&#039;t entirely visible, but I seriously liked it when looking at the long term.<br />
<br />
Mei is a more interesting one, who is in the very same position as Yuzu, they are both coherent to one another, the only difference with Mei is that she is influential, her impact on others is part of the reason why this series is what it is, for that, she plays her role well. There isn&#039;t a lot to go on about the girl, she is closed about herself and tends to not be the most expressive, her troubles, however, are quite the interesting ones, and despite how she is presented, she can boil down to how others behave too, she just took a route she thought was best for her in life, which is a lot different to others, but that is not her core at heart. Even though she is very much human, Mei is presented as a very lost girl, she is disturbed of what it is love should be due to lack of experience on her behalf, it is seen countless times that her conduct simply isn&#039;t the right way to behave, yet she only does so because she doesn&#039;t know better. It is a simple detail, but it makes her more human and something maybe others can relate to, just not as dramatically. I wouldn&#039;t imagine there is more to her than that misguided life, for she isn&#039;t some kind of ridiculous enigma too. I suppose I enjoyed Mei&#039;s presence, and although it seems like she is an emotionless enticing individual with nothing more to her than some horniess, one must not forget what she has gone through in the anime.<br />
<br />
All in all, Citrus is very good at its narrative. It doesn&#039;t have the strongest or most bewildering elements to show off, but it is certainly not one that falls into the general consensus of it being hated for reasons I cannot fully commit myself to. It is a little deep, but plausible, and it is something I quite enjoyed the themes of. Many will be quick to call it uncomfortable as a means to dislike what it is that is presented, but that kind of narrow-minded behaviour doesn&#039;t allow for one to heed the thoughts behind in the first place. It is sad, but such happens. I suppose Citrus is a little citric to all that taste it then. As it should be ironically enough.<br />
<br />
For a Winter 2018 anime, it is just about hitting the bullseye of &quot;good&quot; production. The values here are as clean as the key visual at hand. Polished characters, good animation, you can see the effort has taken place where effort would otherwise be discarded generally. There weren&#039;t too many moments where a scene looked half-hearted, all around, everything was really good. I suppose the actual design of the characters wasn&#039;t unique, but that is the only criticism I can think of if you can even call it that. Nothing wrong with stagnated standards, you just need to ornament or go all out if you wish. Truth be told, for the audio side of Citrus, there wasn&#039;t much of value. Sometimes it would feel like a remix of the main theme would play over some scenes, other moments would fly right over as audio I could not possibly hope to have a lasting impact on me. Seiyuus did as well, as they should, so there isn&#039;t too much to comment on that. If I really wanted to, they managed to leave a good idea of the tone of Yuzu and Mei, but that was about it. Nothing else to speak of.<br />
<br />
So, I enjoyed Citrus, chances are you probably won&#039;t, but I made this review because making reviews are somewhat interesting as well as maybe it could provide some insight as to why this anime isn&#039;t as bad as people make it out to be, it is also nothing I would consider to be something only intelligent people can understand. Really and truly, it is an average romance SoL anime with some very believable and interesting main characters, so not enjoying this would be a little strange, even if presented a little different, assuming you are a fan of SoL romance. Most of what they did can have an enjoyable effect in that participating in the journey with them is entirely worth the while for sure. There are also some wholesome scenes that happen here amongst the chaos.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have any universal guide for the ranking of absolute enjoyment, but I advise one to look at Citrus not in a way that brings forward offensive content, but in a way that is actually trying to understand what it is and why it is people do such &quot;unbelievable&quot; facts, overstepping the boundary of thought is also not advised.<br />
----------<br />
<br />
TLDR Review:<br />
<br />
Story - 8: A great idea and clever way of representing such ideas presented, the direction, however, especially with characters, are a bit undermining, otherwise it is really good.<br />
Visuals - 7: Actual absolute good visuals for its time. Clean characters and everything had some effort into it.<br />
Audio - 6: Not exactly the best, stale and forgettable at times, but nothing actually bad. Seiyuus can leave an impression on Yuzu and Mei tho.<br />
Characters - 8: Very good characters who are very believable, they go through some questionable phases but it is all an understanding process. Side characters aren&#039;t the most interesting themselves tho.<br />
Enjoyment - 7: Quite enjoyable. The idea was nice and everything was really well thought out, enough to look back in a positive manner. Probably not enjoyable if you have a closed mind.<br />
----------<br />
<br />
A long overdue finish in watching this, but I got there in the end. Citrus is pretty good stuff. I tend not to dislike a ton of anime anyway. It was pretty obvious as to why this was hated, but I have an open mind. Have to say, it is much better than Bloom into You tho, and I am saying that as a person who, as of this review, has read the superior version of the more acclaimed series compared to watching the inferior version of the more criticized series. I will just leave my outdated, though somewhat parallel opinions I had on the series:<br />
https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=353051<br />
<br />
Both are still *sometimes* wholesome tho. Anyways, would recommend this, it is good for what it aims to present but it is a little disconnected in the ideas presented, for it is just an everyday romance story slightly derailing against the norm. A story based on a matter of understanding as well as a story of girls&#039; love.<br />
<br />
Also, watch Candy Boy if you like Citrus. Might as well leave my review for that:<br />

    I try to complete it. Citrus is just hard to watch. The characters act without any thinking, consent is not even existing, I think. The dialogues are often cringy and contribute nothing to the story. I don&#039;t know the original source, so I can&#039;t compare it, but the Anime itself is according to my thinking: a trainwreck, which tries too hard to be relatable in some sort, but fails horribly.<br />
The art is mediocre, nothing too special, but still good to look at.<br />
I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, especially to those, who prefer story over fanservice yuri scenes. <br />
I&#039;m actually disappointed. I expected nothing and still - Disappointment<br />

    Ah, Citrus.<br />
The one yuri show that gets shit on because some people don&#039;t like some particular scenes. It&#039;s a shame really, as it has some very good qualities that most people overlook because all they can see is the bathroom scene from episode 1.<br />
<br />
// Story // 9/10<br />
The idea is simple. Yuzu&#039;s mom re-marries after her husband passed away when Yuzu was young. Yuzu and her mom understandable move out into a common appartment for the whole family!<br />
Yuzu then has to attend a new school, an all girls school.She gets caught up with the student council for her appearance and breaking of the rules, and gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322679">
        into a mini-argument with the council president.<br />
Talk about a first day.<br />
Oh and she also catches the super hot teacher kissing said student council president, and did I mention that the pres is now her new step sister?<br />
Yeah, this one kind of seems unrealistic, but to me, it works and it sets the stone for everything that is to come.<br />
Yuzu now has to make friends with Mei, her new step sister, but it goes a bit further than just friends, especially in the manga, *wink wink*<br />
<br />
// Art // 10/10<br />
Like most Yuri shows, this series has a very polished and clean look. Everything is bright, the characters are all flawless. The one big downside to the anime adaptation is the character design not really matching up with saburouta&#039;s (the mangaka behind citrus) original work, especially in the eye department. The difference is very noticeable, but doesn&#039;t hinder the watching experience too much if you haven&#039;t read the manga.<br />
The setting isn&#039;t anything original. Tokyo, all girls school. This makes for some not very original scenery, but scenery that works with the story nontheless.<br />
<br />
// Sound // 7/10<br />
Citrus has probably some of the most forgettable songs as OP and ED.<br />
I didn&#039;t even remember what the OP was until I searched it up on YT and I still have no idea what the ED sounds like.<br />
However, the voice acting is great, the dramatic moments feel dramatic, and the background music works.<br />
<br />
// Character // 10/10<br />
While the anime focuses on (in my opinion) the least interesting part of the manga, it&#039;s still key to watch and understand these episodes to understand the rest of the story for the manga. The anime covers the first few steps between Mei and Yuzu, and it&#039;s important to see it to understand the workings of their relationship later on in the manga.<br />
<br />
// Enjoyment // 10/10<br />
Despite the flaws in the character design, Citrus is a series that I will always love, and one of the few that I find myself re-reading quite often. To say that I started watching because I was bored and found this randomly on crunchyroll...

    *spoilers, language* trigger warning: sexual assault, incest, and harmful stereotypes of lesbians<br />
<br />
Let’s talk about problematicism. This isn’t a word, but if it was, let’s go ahead and slap it on Citrus. That’s what this show is, problematic in every way but its core. Let’s slap dreadful and sickening on there as well. <br />
<br />
Citrus, at the surface, is a simple show that could go to many places narratively. We then meet the MC. Yuzu Aihara just stepped out of an 80s movie/ poorly written Episode story (props to you if you know what those are) and has entered a new, private all-girls school. Her mother was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346819">
        recently divorced and remarried to the son of the Chairmen of the School, whose daughter is the student council president. So we’ve got a typical start of a romance school anime, nothing out of the ordinary here. <br />
<br />
However, not ten minutes in, after an OP that sounds like it has been pulled out of the bucket of standard anime OPs and riddled with incestuous hints at what’s to come (aren’t you just so excited?), is a scene where Yuzu, as she is arriving on the school campus, and in many violations of this school’s strict dress code, is explicitly touched sexually, without consent, mind you, by the student council president, whose name we later learn to be Mei. Mei’s hands are everywhere a stranger’s hands shouldn&#039;t be, and Yuzu has repeatedly said “stop, leave me alone”. That probably just took you off guard since, you know, her stepsister just sexually assaulted her. And she just walks away like it was nothing. <br />
<br />
I wish I had counted how many times a character sexually assaulted another character in this show. I am positive I couldn’t count it, on one hand, let alone two. And it’s not just the occasional throw of the skirt or grope, it’s full-on, I’m ripping off your shirt and trying to kiss you while having an emotional break down by BOTH of the MCs, Yuzu and Mei alike. And this continuously happens throughout this excruciating series. None of the characters get any sort of punishment, chastisement, NOTHING to even point out that their behavior is predatory and wrong by any of the other characters, mostly because the two who are doing it to each other are stepsisters and have come to terms with the fact that is just a part of their sisterly relationship. But the point still stands, sexual assault should not occur this often in anime where it is glossed over and used as a plot point to further the story. <br />
<br />
But I digress, and I shall continue to my next qualm with this anime. Due to this show’s status as a romance anime, it is, naturally, going to be character-driven. Character-driven shows usually aren’t hard to pin down. As a writer myself, I find it much easier to create character-based stories, especially if I am writing romance. But the characters, in a character-driven story, need to, you know, have character. Firstly, let’s discuss Mei Aihara, the chairman’s biological granddaughter and, to put it simply, the most fucked-up character of this show. In the first episode, she kisses Yuzu without explanation after it is revealed that they are going to be living together because of her mather’s remarriage to Mei’s father, and Yuzu confronts her about her romantic relationship with their teacher that she witnessed. Mei claims she is clueless because she has not been kissed, so she shuts her up with a big ole, unconsented smooch, leaving Yuzu writhing in confusion, but also arousal as it is portrayed. But this doesn’t stop here. Oh no, there is still more incest to come. At the end of the third episode, Yuzu visits Mei after she has been taken away by her grandmother due to Yuzu’s embarrassment of the family name, and while they are having just sisterly “come back home” talks, Mei throws Yuzu on the bed and rips her top open, beginning to cry as she attempts to make physical contact with her stepsister. And then, more simple things, she calls her father “professor” because he teaches her so much, she can’t make up her mind about what she wants to be with Yuzu. She never shows emotions and is constantly leading the characters in this show on, just to throw them off when push comes to shove. Mei Aihara needs HELP, this character is irredeemable. The only redeemable character, to be frank, is Yuzu’s best friend who has to put up with all these character’s bullshit, props to her. <br />
<br />
For my final point, I’m going to touch on something that this anime contributes to on a wider scale, harmful LGBTQ+ stereotypes, especially towards women who are attracted to women. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll say lesbian. Lesbians are constantly suffering from the stereotype of being called predatory, promiscuous, or just sick and messed up in the head. So for this show to just come out of the water with lesbians who are sexually assaulting their stepsister is frankly appalling. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community myself, this show genuinely makes me sick at my stomach because the people who watch this without being aware of those stereotypes are going to take it at face value and think all lesbians are like the girls in Citrus. This show is hurtful and harmful to lesbian representation in anime, and the folks over at Studio Passione need to learn from their mistakes. <br />
<br />
Was there anything good about this anime? Other than the animation, I can’t think of any. The pure idiotic writing of this show sucks the life out of you as you watch it. I binged it, and I can honestly say, do not binge this show. If you want to watch it and get it out to the way to laugh how bad it is, then do it, but take caution cause this show is downright awful in so many ways. I hope to see this show in the dictionary definition of these words: problematic, dreadful, sickening. That’s what this show is.

     MAJOR SPOILER<br />
Alright this is a serious review and my first review, but let me say I have read the manga before. Another thing is I don&#039;t review this like an idiot who thinks after reading Beserk, Stein, Monster, FMA:B, or any other &quot;masterpieces&quot; that they have the philosophers hammer and the alchemist stone. I also rate mostly on enjoyment primarily. All right lets begin. <br />
<br />
Act 1; The Story:8<br />
The story accomplishes what it set out to do, and that is a dramatic story about two lesbian lover who are now sisters. Now let me say this, don&#039;t expect this to be a masterpiece in terms

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270997">
        of story, pacing, and execution. (Though it&#039;s my personal masterpiece) Ep1 spoilers only. The story begins with Yuzu talking to her friends on how she want&#039;s a boyfriend. Her luck was awful, as she went to an all girls school. At the entrance she meets Mei, a rather calm and beautiful girl, as she has violated school regulation. She then sifts Yuzu to get her phone and tell her to wash the makeup off. She then encounters another girl who had the same troubles of the school regulation, Harumin. Harumin basically tells her why the students are rather dull and how they were sheltered. They become friends as they are both alike. She then has her first conflict as she sees Mei kissing the same teacher. When she tried to get away, they notice she was nearby from her clumsy mistake. She runs. She then returns home only to be shocked that Mei, the same girl, was her new sister. She seems rather stunned and uneasy on Mei. From there she bugged her until she brought up the incident and asked how can she kiss if she is not genuinely in love and is only doing it for the thrill. This is where I&#039;ll end it here as I might get this review taken down for play-by-play and if i spoiled the first major plot point. The show does the drama right, most of the tension is explainable and the execution is generally done well.  The grimes with it&#039;s a little fast pace at times, but everything is well done and In My Opinion, great. Though the story is about same sex love, and if your against that then don&#039;t watch. As for the yuri scenes, they are mostly explained why it happens, so to put it off as fan service is definitely wrong.<br />
<br />
Act 2; Animation and Soundtrack: 7.6<br />
The animation for the show is Amazing, but some of the original art work from the manga is not shown at the same time. One of the many good things about the manga is the artwork and the anime has shown to reflect that but at the same time have a modern take on the show&#039;s artwork. Now more on about the errors in the animation, there are scenes that look wonky. Though the animation has gotten better, there is still scenes that look messed up still, but it was less apparent with it&#039;s improvement. The ost fits the show well and are mostly, music to my ears. The VA&#039;s have done their part greatly and for their dub counterpart(Dub isn&#039;t my favorite thong to listen) they have seem to do justice for dubbers. The op and ed are another thing that I have to give praise to as they really fit the show.<br />
<br />
Act 3; Character: 8.3<br />
Most of the characters are really fun and interesting. No character doesn&#039;t feel annoying or boring. Personally I like Momokino as her character design and her personality I can definitely enjoy. All the characters have a motivational factor for their actions and their personality are great. Still, there are still some things to push them over for, the characters are great.<br />
<br />
Act 4; Enjoyment and Overall: 9 (for enjoyment) 8 (Overall)<br />
I really enjoyed the anime so far as it has been a great adaptation for the series. It really has been my number 3 show for the winter season so far. (#1 is Magus Bride) Overall it gets a 9/10 and my recommendations are Dear My Girl, The Star and The Flower, and Sakura Trick. <br />
<br />
Fin <br />
Sidenote; If you literally reviewed this like a philosopher, then you going about an entertainment media the wrong way.<br />
<br />
What would you like me to review next, Berserk after 100-200 chapters, Magus Bride, Hajime No Ippo Manga or show, or would you like me to watch your personal favorite show. Comment on my profile and I&#039;ll see what are the most popular choice so that I can review it next.

    I&#039;m gonna preface this by simply saying I&#039;m a bisexual transgender woman so I just kinda GET it. I know how important representation of LGBT is..<br />
<br />
That being said I constantly have an issue with certain forms of media being seen as better simply because it represents LGBT and you can bet my ENTIRE ass that I definitely count this anime under the &quot;bad but people like lesbians&quot; category.<br />
<br />
You know what this anime involves? Girls forcing each other into kisses. Which by all accounts is literally sexual assault and I hate that.<br />
<br />
I actually don&#039;t know what to say without going onto a rant, but I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332456">
        really hoping this anime was a good yuri anime, instead it gets praised so much for being one that some people don&#039;t realise it actually kinda blows.<br />
<br />
The animation itself is nice to look at though, and for those that want fan service... It has it.  <br />
<br />
This is a lame review and I&#039;m realising this now I&#039;m writing it, but I still hope people can understand my opinion regardless.

    This anime is okay if you leave out some major plot points. I don&#039;t count this as a girl&#039;s love anime, I think there&#039;s a little too much rape like moments for it to be counted as a genuine relationship. <br />
I understand that Mei is really screwed up and mentally ill, and that Yuzu is a closeted lesbian, but it still seems rapey. Like Mei is just pissed off and letting out her pent up emotional frustrations by trying to have sex/whatever with Yuzu. <br />
It&#039;s not hot, it&#039;s mental illness. I do love yuri anime, I really do, I&#039;m gay myself but this does not

    Citrus was my ex-girlfriend&#039;s favorite anime and my god, does that explain a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Anyways I knew this anime was about some weird step-sister incest shit, but I still watched it because I just felt like watching something shitty. I was prepared for the incest shit, not for how rapey the show is. To be honest, this show could&#039;ve been at least decent without all the gross shit. God, I just want healthy lesbians relationships in anime, not gross, yuri shit, and THIS.<br />
<br />
First of all, Yuzu and Mei are sisters? What the fuck? Step-sisters but still sisters. &quot;Oh well it&#039;s not biological so it&#039;s fine.&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342421">
        Legally? Technically in some states, yes. Morally? It&#039;s still gross in most cases. If they were raised as siblings, or see each other as siblings, then it&#039;s gross, because they still have a sibling relationship. Step-siblings are still siblings. I have step-siblings and since I saw them as my siblings the idea of dating one of them makes me wanna die. Yuzu and Mei weren&#039;t raised together, but they call each other their sister and stuff. And the show is all &quot;Oh! Look at these sisters making out. Isn&#039;t that so hot?&quot; It&#039;s like they wanted to write some gross incest crap but decided to use the &quot;Oh, well technically they&#039;re step-siblings!&quot; as an excuse.<br />
<br />
The incest isn&#039;t the only problem I have with this show. It&#039;s also super rapey. The characters sexually assault each other many times throughout the show and it&#039;s portrayed as sexy and romantic, and even brushed off as a joke. It seems that every time Mei kisses or touches Yuzu without consent (or vice versa) they get even closer. Ew. Sexual assault and abuse aren&#039;t romantic. Mei and Yuzu are such an unhealthy relationship. This is some Stockholm syndrome shit. Also didn&#039;t Yuzu, who is 16, go on a date with Matsuri, who is 13? Um? Also kinda gross.<br />
<br />
They could&#039;ve created a story similar to this without all the incest, sexual assault, etc. They were trying to go the whole &#039;forbidden love&#039; route when the step-sibling aspect wasn&#039;t needed. The fact that they&#039;re both girls could&#039;ve been forbidden love enough. Homophobia still exists. Make them not step-sisters, make the forbidden love aspect the fact that they&#039;re gay. And get rid of the weird rape shit. Boom. Fixed it, now it isn&#039;t gross. Or hell, if you wanted them to remain sisters, get rid of the romance and focus of their sisterly bonds or some shit. Just not this. We&#039;re really sick and tired of all the lesbian romances in anime being some weird, creepy shit.
