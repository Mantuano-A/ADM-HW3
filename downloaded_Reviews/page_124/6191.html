    As a large fan of the Cyborg 009 series, this movie felt like a personal offense. The movie is a darker, &#039;realistic&#039; reimagining on the series and its characters. This isn&#039;t inherently a bad thing, of course, but it comes off as following the current trend of gritty remakes instead of trying to understand its source material.<br />
<br />
The plot is confusing whether you are familiar with the show or not. It might help to be acquainted with the characters and their backstories beforehand, but the movie doesn&#039;t even try to explain its own universe. What little there is of the story is given through large, boring

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189211">
        exposition with nothing visually interesting happening on the screen. Questions constantly asked throughout the film are only ever answered with a character shrugging their shoulders, then are never addressed again. All of this is topped with a near comically vague ending.<br />
<br />
The art is a strange hybrid of CGI and 2D, which makes for a lot of blank staring and jerky movement. The animation is at its best when there&#039;s a lot of action going on screen - but considering RE&#039;s love for characters talking to one another about the scarce plot, satisfying fights are few and far between.<br />
<br />
As far as sound goes, this is one of the only things I don&#039;t have any real qualms with. It wasn&#039;t memorable or anything, but it wasn&#039;t terrible and at least upped the hype a little at certain points in the film.<br />
<br />
As far as the characters go in this movie, they themselves are not bad. What is bad, however, is their treatment. Jet has been turned into an extreme asshole with far worse of an attitude than we&#039;ve ever seen before, and has lost his defining physical features. Francoise meanwhile has been shoehorned into a sex symbol being the series only main female character, complete with a pointless, uncomfortably long scene of her in lingerie making out with Joe. There&#039;s not much to say about the other characters, as they didn&#039;t get much screen time.<br />
<br />
All in all, I&#039;m giving this movie a 1 for all around poor story, poor animation, and poor characters. Perhaps watch it if you&#039;re looking for something hilariously bad and confusing, but otherwise I recommend you skip it entirely.

    There&#039;s a new fashion in the anime industries the last few years were old school manga are either adapted to anime (like Parasite and Jojo&#039;s bizarre adventure) or they are getting reboots (like Sailor moon and Hunter x hunter). Yet in Cyborg 009&#039;s case things are different. The classic manga of Ishinomori sensei has three anime adaptations and even more movies. Is like the anime industry wants to introduce to every new generation this classic  story. I myself have watched the 2001 version when I was a kid and I can say in a way that I grew up with it. I recently watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181464">
        it again to remember those times and then watch this movie. Well I can say that the results didn&#039;t dissapointed me at all.<br />
<br />
The story in this movie has a lot of changes than the anime. Actually this movie is loosely based on Ishinomori&#039;s epic. This happened because this movie had a big problem. How could it to introduce to teenagers nowadays who grew up with fast paced anime, with lots of gore and fights like Tokyo ghoul, Naruto, Bleach and many more, a story that was written in the middle of the 70&#039;s. In order to manage this the movie ditches the somehow naive story  of the anime and takes the story&#039;s setting to today&#039;s world. I liked it that. Sure it didn&#039;t remind me at all the classic anime but as I said this is  mostly a try to introduce the story to teenagers today. And I believe it did it very well. I had a little problem with the plot though. I would like it if it wasn&#039;t  so much Americanized. But I will explain this later. Also it isn&#039;t necessary to see the anime but I would recommend it  if you want to know some things about the characters.<br />
<br />
About the animation itself I can&#039;t find words to describe it. Production IG did a stunning job. The animation is amazing and the movie doesn&#039;t loose any opportunity to show it off in almost every scene.  I was captivated by it right from the first moment. I couldn&#039;t find any flow in it no matter how hard I tried. If I could rate it with  mark above 10 i would gladly do it. Another thing that I liked in this movie was the sound. A first class budged movie demands a first class voice actors. Mamoru Miyano, Daisuke Ono, Toru Okawa Noriaki Sugiyama and all the other seiyuus did an excellent job capturing their characters  personalities almost as good as voice actors of the 2001 anime&#039;s. Also this movie had excellent OST&#039;s and really good sound effects. For the latter you just have to listen to Ivan&#039;s voice every time he  speaks.<br />
<br />
The characters was the weakest link of this movie.  Because the characters  wouldn&#039;t appeal to the teenagers with their obsolete 70&#039;s animation changes were made not only in their design (which was fair I have to say) but mostly in their personalities.  The movie introduced the characters like they were an X-Men rip off. Because of the already mentioned Americanization  the characters were made to look like American superheroes and this way a little bit of their personalities was lost. In either way if you haven&#039;t seen any of the previews anime adaptation I don&#039;t thing you will have a big problem with this.<br />
<br />
Summarizing, I have to say that I was really pleased with this movie. It didn&#039;t looked like the anime series at all but I don&#039;t think this was a problem. It did a fairly good job at introducing Joe and the others in the new generation. I&#039;m really curious to see if there&#039;s gonna be another adaptation. Who knows maybe in a decade or so we will see a crossover between between the 00 cyborgs and X-men. I would like to see that.

    Now before beginning a few things that I need to say. I haven&#039;t watched the original 009 series which was aired before i was even born but I have watched the 2001 remake when it aired in my country. I have forgotten most of the storyline but I do remember bits and pieces and the feeling that I had when watching it. Cyborg 009 (2001) was possibly the second anime I watched and it was absolutely stunning! at that time. My review down below is taking into consideration what I felt when I first watched the series.<br />
<br />
When I watched the movie I was initially excited

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106707">
        at the way they had changed the character designs and added a touch of freshness.<br />
<br />
For those of you who have already watched any of the previous series, NOSTALGIA IS ILL ADVISED. Yes, the characters are a bit nostalgic, yes the action is a bit nostalgic and yes, the overhaul with CG looks amazing initially BUT here are somethings you may not swallow very well. (Forgive me if they seem irate.)<br />
<br />
One, I may not remember the 2001 series that well but I most certainly definitely absolutely remember it was lucid and simple plot that my childish brain could follow with ease. Okay, so that generation is all grown up and needs adult material, alright... BUT that does not mean you should make it into some freakin&#039; goddamn Evangelion plot with HIS voice governing all. Yeah, yeah I know you don&#039;t give a damn about God but why use it just to give your plot some pseudo-intellectual pseudo-religious air. I mean was 009 ever this psychological?! Hell no. WTF is Freud doing in a sci-fi, battle anime which was much better without that complex mind-curdling crap.<br />
If i want to watch psychological complexity and Freud&#039;s theories I&#039;d  much rather watch Evangelion and Ergo Proxy. They just ruined a totally fine storyline because they couldn&#039;t come with an antithesis? Man, I&#039;m beyond words at this.<br />
<br />
Two, the characters. Well given the short timespan, they did a fine job at introducing the characters. But they cannot be fleshed out as well as they were in the series. The sense of familiarity is reduced because the characters hardly get much time except 009 of course. The rest have to spew the stupid psychological shit in the extremely limited time they get. I&#039;m wondering if they forgot about half of the team less than halfway through the movie. But well I liked Joe and Francoise, and their little eyecandy, so ok...<br />
<br />
Third, the art and animation. In my view it is clearly rushed and subpar. If they think that CG can make it astounding they are so wrong. The character designs are more elaborate but not well rounded. The animation is clearly so stiff that I am thoroughly disappointed. This possibly due to overuse of CG in every aspect. Guess they didn&#039;t want much fine-tuned work on it eh? But the backgrounds and special effects are done quite well.<br />
<br />
If you can get past all of those this movie is enjoyable enough. The action scenes are fine and the sound tracks are good. For someone like me who was a big fan of the original series, it is enjoyable even if a turnoff.<br />
<br />
Bottomline, Rushed anime, Altered plot, Unneeded improvisation but worth a watch.<br />
<br />
LOL  I seem really sarcastic here. But believe, it is worth watching even if just for the eye candy.<br />

         Re: Cyborg 009 is, in a word, disappointing. As a fan of the 2001 series since childhood and a great admirer of the studio which worked on this (Production I.G., who are responsible for such wonderful series as Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex) I expected great things from this darker, more realistic take on the classic franchise. Sadly, despite a promising start and beautiful animation, the film falls flat on its&#039; face, resulting in something which may be worth watching once, but which cannot stand up to even the most cursory analysis.<br />
<br />
     It would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159745">
        be terribly easy to blame this film&#039;s failings as yet another example of why remaking children&#039;s series as &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;gritty&quot; doesn&#039;t work, but to do that would be to disrespect the source material. Why Ishinomori&#039;s manga and the preceding anime series were definitely goofy, there has always been an undercurrent of mystery and intrigue to them that is very compatible with darker tones. Sadly, the writer of this film seems to have confused &quot;dark&quot; with &quot;unnecessarily confusing&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot; with &quot;random statements about God with no connecting thread&quot;.<br />
<br />
     The plot is, for one thing, completely impenetrable to new viewers. If one is not already familiar with the franchise, this film offers only a few badly-executed lines of exposition to explain to you who exactly these<br />
characters are, and does even less to show why you should care about them. This would not be so much of a problem if the premise of the film<br />
and it&#039;s status as a stand-alone universe within the Cyborg 009 canon did<br />
not seem to set it up as a jumping-on point for new viewers. The main <br />
character begins the film with amnesia for god&#039;s sake, and yet he regains<br />
his memories incredibly unceremoniously, without even the briefest of<br />
flashbacks to hint at his origins. Instead, this is infodumped to you almost<br />
halfway through the film, at which point it might have been better not to mention it at all. <br />
<br />
     For all the story&#039;s numerous failings and it&#039;s failure to highlight what <br />
makes these characters interesting, the film at least looks good. Surprisingly, even someone like me who is normally squeamish about CGI mixing with 2D animation, the action sequences are not only dynamic but fluid in a way that<br />
evokes the best of action cinema, making full use of the cyborgs&#039; fantastic powers. Of particular note is the film&#039;s rendition of Jet Link, who visually puts<br />
all previous incarnations of the character to shame. A pity the same can&#039;t be said for his personality.<br />
<br />
     Overall, I would recommend this movie most to people who have not interest whatsoever in the source material, but who appreciate good fight<br />
choreography and beautiful animation. If you care about the series at all and/or are unable to turn your brain completely off in order to soak in disjointed action scenes, then you should probably watch the 2001 TV series instead to get your cyborg fix.<br />

    Story<br />
I haven&#039;t watched the original series, and i didn&#039;t understand most of what was going on. however, i got the basic message of the movie. the movie was great in many ways and i was highly entertained. <br />
Art<br />
The art was outstanding. the environment is a mixture of 2 and 3-d rendering. the buildings are especially exquisite and i loved the characters interaction and movement. although, they could have done better with the sea. they remained stagnate. most individuals will probably not notice. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The movie sound was great. the voice actors did an amazing job in my opinion.   <br />
<br />
Character<br />
For a 1 hr movie you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104307">
        could feel the depth of each character. they all had their differences especially Joe and jet.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I personally thoroughly enjoyed this movie. For an individual like myself that enjoy most action anime, this has one of the best action sequence anyone can ask for. if you love action movies or anime don&#039;t pass this. it should be ranked among the top 100 anime. i enjoyed the movie to the fullest. i wish their was more action or something like a last boss/antagonist. <br />
<br />
Overall<br />
There&#039;s nothing much to say that i haven&#039;t already said. the anime was highly entertaining and had a decent message to the viewers. it reminded me of a story in the bible... i urge everyone to give this a try. it&#039;s only less than 2 hrs of your life, so watch and be entertained. <br />
<br />

    So when I saw this in the store I knew I had to have it, as I remember watching the 2001 show growing up. I loved how the cover looked and as soon as I got home I watched it. Sadly, I became instantly disappointed. <br />
<br />
The art was entirely CG with a weird outline of 2D thrown in. It was very off putting but I hoped the plot made up for it. The plot itself was very confusing and if it wasn&#039;t for the little guidebook they put in with the DVD combo pack I would be soooo lost. The fact that they have to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197595">
        put a guidebook with all the characters backgrounds, the vital plot points, and all the cities that&#039;s in it, is just a testament to how confusing this movie was. It even had an interview section in the back that had the director trying to explain why they did it and the whole &quot;His Voice&quot; and the angel thing. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong I liked the movie just fine, with the action scenes and even if there wasn&#039;t much character development, they were still decent. If you don&#039;t mind a little thought provoking plot and weird art style this movie isn&#039;t bad! Try not to compare it with the show or manga as even the director said the movie is based on the &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;God&#039;s War&quot; arc in the manga, and it&#039;s their take on what they wanted to happen. Note I haven&#039;t read the manga so I can&#039;t say if I think they did good on that point.<br />
<br />
All in all not a bad movie and I might watch it again if I&#039;m bored, but I have to say I&#039;ve found a new favorite qoute!!! Though, pay heed, listeners to His Voice: For, some ordeals waged in His honor may not force man to hear as thou. May the devout bring justice to all people of the earth, and let mankind start anew. May His Voice free us from sin, and bless us with glory, honor, and prosperity unending.<br />

    Let me first point out that the old series was incredibly corny and flunky by today&#039;s standards. However, at its time of airing it had a lot of relevance, mainly due to the historical context of the Cold War and political climate, something this movie failed to include when adapting it for the current generation. Buildings being bombed in the name of God... it sure does seem like a subject that could make a point of modern terrorism and politics, but instead it turns into a pseudo-philosophical quest to search for God. <br />
<br />
The villain of the movie is illogical on every level. While the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172373">
        had a running theme of questioning religion and often exposing them as frauds, this story instead decides to portray God as a real tangible thing, and not just as a tool used by humans to control the masses. I do not dislike it for being different, I am calling it out for going against the main themes of the franchise to the point that it might as well have been called something else.<br />

I like the new designs of the characters, it is a shame they weren&#039;t given more time to shine. I&#039;m aware that they could not have fleshed them all out on such limited time, but I believe they still could have made them work together more often, rather than just make Joe the Tom Cruise of the team.<br />
<br />
It had a few action-scenes of note that I enjoyed, though they are few and far between, and finally the ending is nonsensical cop-out. If you&#039;re a fan, or have high demands of this, please skip it.

    After 32 years of the previous movie, Production IG took Toei place and did a remake of the series. <br />
<br />
This time around instead of mechanical monsters or aliens that are threatening the Cyborg team, its suicide bomber!<br />
<br />
Yeah. <br />
<br />
Let me just say the kid stuffs has been replaced with adult theme problems, as the cyborgs reassemble to fight for humanity in 21th century. I mean seriously, what do you expect from the studio who made Ghost in the Shell?<br />
<br />
When I start to watch this movie, or any of these movies, I try to keep an open mind so that my judgement wouldn&#039;t be clouded by what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210229">
        the series previous has shown. Especially for this one since people either thought this was a clever way of introducing the series to a newer audience or hated it for how gritty it is was.<br />
<br />
But let’s look at the good parts first.<br />
<br />
The action scenes in this movie are incredible. The CGI really does the work as the scenes looks much grander and more detailed than any other of the movies. Even if the CGI is used much during the movie, it ties in and doesn&#039;t become too distracting.<br />
<br />
As for the design, I like it. It fits with the mood well. Sure it doesn&#039;t look too cartoonish, but same time, it doesn&#039;t look too realistic. It’s a nice blend between those elements and the design does make the cyborgs look like real people, which is an achievement in itself.<br />
<br />
Now what about story and the characters? Well, if you expect this movie to be similar to the other movies I’ve reviewed, then you’re mistaken. <br />
<br />
I think there are two problems that people mostly see in this movie. One is that this movie is much darker than the other movies. And two, that this doesn&#039;t have much chemistry between most the members.<br />
<br />
People may argu that this movie is too dark and too psychological for the series, but if you have ever read the God War arc, then you know it’s not true. So it’s not about “if they can embrace darker themes”, but more “how they embrace it”. I mean, gritty remakes or re-imaging have been executed quite well. But there’s always a problem that it might not represent the original or keep it spirit alive, and here, it’s close to that problem.  <br />
<br />
As for the characters, this movie felt like the watchmen all over again, with all the character questioning their moral and ending up fighting against one another. Even if this is a remake of the God arc, I wouldn&#039;t really call this a remake, as it feels like it’s already been built on a establish version.  Which why newer audience might not see the cyborgs much as a good team.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that all the character doesn&#039;t seem to have a fully develop personalities or have the time to do so. You will understand when you watch it. But for those who does have the time, it really contrasts on how much mature and serious the characters are from their counterparts. For example, 003 and 009 had a more innocent relationship in the first three movies. They are holding hands and hug each other times to time, showing it off in the most kid friendly way. But here, they DEFIANTLY have a sexual thing for each other. No use of hiding it, these two have gone beyond the first base. If you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
And for once, they even discuss the consequences of never ageing. Which is again very fitting and should be brought up as 009 always remain as a teen throughout the years.<br />
It might be going too much, but I think that the way the character acts are very fitting for a group who has been separated for years and been living in a grey yet subtle world.<br />
<br />
But what is not subtle is the symbolism. Religious symbolism is at full force in this movie, and it can get very tedious. It’s everywhere. Now I know that this is Production I.G. we are talking about, who usually show off their philosophical pattering thought Sci-Fi films. But I think they might could had been more subtle like they did in Ghost in the shell and not as hammered in.<br />
<br />
The antagonist in this movie, unlike the rest of the movies before, is actually an intimidating. Unlike Black Ghost who answered to all evil in heart of men, and Zoa who wanted to rule over the universe, “His voice” is a concept of justice and purity that could strike anyone. It could turn anyone who hears it be loyal to its bidding and commit horrible acts without them releasing it. That, is a scary concept as it has no specific form or shape. Although the pronoun game is very strong in this movie, the force seems to be one of the most powerful things that the Cyborgs has ever faced.  <br />
<br />
As I said before, this movie isn&#039;t as light-hearted as the other movies. I will not further spoil this movie or bring up any other plot element, as it has to be seen to believe. Especially the ending, which is open to interpretation.<br />
<br />
People may be pissed off since they have been attached to the TV series, but I think it was worth it to see how the same concept could be handled with much darker. Beside, this is an adaptation of an unfinished arc which was supposed to be the last of the Cyborgs, so it might not be too bad as people claim it to be. But still, this movie has some flaws that won’t satisfy the fans.<br />
<br />
For me, you need to be in a right mood to watch it. Don’t expect this to be much of the traditional cyborg stuff. I mean, THIS MOVIE OPENS UP WITH SUIDICE BOMBING, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE?<br />
<br />
Watch it if you want to see more mature Cyborgs being hunted by angels from the unknown.

    This film... this film...<br />
I purchased this film for $2.99 in HD on iTunes.  So this is definitely the easiest way to get it. (3.5 GB needed)<br />
<br />
If it weren&#039;t for the story, everything would be wonderful. The art and animation both make use of 3-D and 2-D blending. The colors are vibrant, and I can see what&#039;s going on. They went out of their way to make the VA have non-stereotypical accents native to their country, which is a nice touch on the dubbing I had only previously seen with Unbreakable Machine Doll. (Though I kept the expecting the 2001 VA) It&#039;s why I gave

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215887">
        the sound a 10.<br />
<br />
The story... however, is a deep, philosophical rambling about what induced man to have a God and bombings.I feel like the the writers wrote a script for 2 1/2-3 hour epic, but as scenes got cut, the meanings of the remaining scenes got left behind, resulting in so much loss of context that the writers lost touch with what the viewer would be seeing. Alright, yeah, it makes sense... because this deleted scene or what was on the chopping board.<br />
 <br />
Couldn&#039;t it have been just your general &#039;remnants of Black Ghost&#039;? Throw in some flashbacks and the characters are instantly so much more relatable, and I become invested in them that much more.<br />
<br />
And unless you know about the original shooting star ending that the original manga intended to end on, then the ending sorta doesn&#039;t mean anything.<br />

    Like many anime fans, I&#039;m guilty of under-appreciating the visuals and having my feelings swayed mostly by the story and in particular the characters. Although I want to rectify this, I don&#039;t really have a good eye for animation details. So while the spirit is willing the eye-flesh is ... uhh ... what&#039;s the visual equivalent of tone-deaf? Art-blind? Anyway, despite my art-blind eye-flesh, occasionally I find myself gravitating towards an anime because of some awesome visuals.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s what happened in the case of &quot;009 Re:Cyborg&quot;, which, despite having heard that the story makes no sense, I&#039;ve been wanting to see ever since I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297699">
        blown away by the visuals in the trailer.<br />
<br />
It turned out to be more or less as expected. The movie&#039;s most striking aspect is the animation, which is entirely CG. People in the fandom tend to praise CG in anime in much the same way as people in the health industry like to extol the virtues of smoking, but I think in the case of &quot;009 Re:Cyborg&quot;, the CG is closer to eye candy than eye cancer. Admittedly, some of the movements still look a bit synthetic, but I love the character designs, and the action is spectacular.<br />
<br />
The action sequences are the best part of &quot;009: Re-Cyborg&quot;. The movie&#039;s action set pieces made superb use of the CG capabilities, blowing me away with special effects such as the matrix-esq slow motion shots. These sequences are further enhanced by the throbbing techno music that wove a montage-like tapestry of sound in the background, its release of melodies timed carefully to the choreography and its ebb and flow orchestrating the ease and build-up of tension as one scene segued seamlessly into the next. The trailer actually managed to capture a lot of what made the action so good, and that played a big part in persuading me to watch the movie.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#039;t get enough of the action, so it&#039;s a little unfortunate that &quot;009 Re:Cyborg&quot; is not a particularly action-heavy movie; it&#039;s arguably more driven by the mystery and intrigue. So let&#039;s talk about the elephant in the room when it comes to this anime - the story.<br />
<br />
First, a bit of background: the 00 cyborgs are a team of nine cyborgs led by a human scientist Dr Gilmore. Like a team of superheroes, they originally fought various threats to the world, but &quot;009 Re:Cyborg&quot; takes place many years after the team disbanded. In this story, Dr Gilmore tries to bring the team together again to counter a new threat: the destruction of high rises in large metropolises around the world, carried out by terrorists following the orders of &quot;His Voice&quot;.<br />
<br />
From what I&#039;ve heard, the original &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; was the product of the social political climate of its time, so it&#039;s fitting that the remake also reflects the anxieties of the world we live in today - the relevant topic this time round being terrorism.<br />
<br />
Given what I&#039;d heard about the movie beforehand, I found to my surprise that most of this movie seems to make sense. As someone who knew little of the back stories, I thought it did a good job of supplying the necessary background without getting bogged down by exposition. I also appreciated its commentary on terrorism and the roles that religion, greed and politics play in its inception.<br />
<br />
However, as it went on, &quot;009 Re:Cyborg&quot; increasingly obsessed over its religious themes to the detriment of everything else in the story. So much so that I started feeling like I was witnessing a religious fanatic having a revelation: perhaps it all makes sense to them, but to me it just comes across like incomprehensible madness. This downward trend accumulates in an ending that had me head scratching to the point of severe hair loss. Besides eliciting responses like &quot;what the fuck just happened,&quot; it&#039;s an ending of such colossal magnitude of deus ex machina that it makes most other such endings look like ones borne of natural plot progression.<br />
<br />
In the end, that somewhat ruined &quot;009 Re:Cyborg&quot; for me. Still, I don&#039;t regret watching the movie - it was worth it just for the visuals. After all, once in a while even art-blind eyes can enjoy eye candy. Mmmm candy... *drools*<br />
<br />

    I saw this for the first time, and quite frankly, I fail to see how this anime - based on the 009 Cyborg series, apparently - is given so much slam and so much rage against it. Personally speaking, I actually loved this anime. I actually find it to be a really well thought out movie which introduced a new viewer to the series itself.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The thing which made this anime standout, for me, was how the anime itself addressed the question of &quot;His Voice&quot;, and actually carried itself not just that as a plot device, but also the in-anime presentation to proceed with the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211905">
        itself. The perspective given by &quot;His Voice&quot;; as explained in the movie, was not only sufficient (for me as a first time viewer) to appreciate the story as well as give an interesting philosophical perspective on its origins. Yes, there is a cliffhanger ending in terms of HOW the characters - Gilmour, Joe, GB, Palma, Henrick, Jumani, Francoise, 001 and Jeb - wound up in the ending, but for me it certainly provided room for perspective and ascertainment of what could be the possible causes of it. If anything else, the story was handled well and used its characters, art, and sound well.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Personally, I found this anime to be gorgeous. The use of CGI may be slammed in general by anime fans - but then again, anime fans love Naruto which is a shitty anime. It was realistic enough in its textures and detailing of the characters, as well as their environment. Addition to this was the subtlety that was imbued through the anime to portray the emotions and general feelings and thoughts going through the minds of the characters - supporting, main, and NPCs alike. What&#039;s more, it gave the action more depth and involvement and frankly, I couldn&#039;t fault it in any form or way and find it surprising that people would slam it. The subtlety in each scene is integral and adds to the viewing pleasure of this anime movie.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The best way to experience this movie, is through the English dub. The acting in the dub represents all the characters well and all of the standout. Granted, there could be raised the concern regarding the soundtrack, but personally I overlooked it because it matched the mood which was needed in each and every scene. Furthermore, the anime in its quiet moments added to the feel and the character arcs of each of the cast, which makes it as good as it can get for 2012. Kudos for a good job.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Perhaps the single biggest facet for me to watch this anime was the characters - I really do feel like investing myself in the 009 anime series to know the characters and their back stories. Even if I didn&#039;t know that, I found the characters were likeable, and I could relate with their struggles as a viewer. Everyone did a good job and fulfilled their roles well, even providing a realistic representation of how they would act if put in such a situation which is unfolded in the story.<br />
<br />
Overall, I found this anime to be a significantly better and more satisfying and entertaining sit than the crappy Sengoku Basara, and makes me feel satisfied enough to want to know the series more. I personally recommend it, even if other people don&#039;t.

    This shall be short or at least that is the aim.<br />
<br />
Firstly one must not require previous knowledge into this franchise to enjoy this movie. Prior knowledge would help greatly and help understand the background and relationships of the characters a lot more but most certainly is not a requirement.<br />
<br />
One of the elements i enjoyed most about this movie was its sound. Everything from the music to the sound effects to the voice acting, very easy on the ears in all respects. One thing i can’t stand is when a simple explosion feels wrong because it sound like nails on a chalkboard. I can only imagine

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106237">
        how good it must sound in a theatre.<br />
<br />
Coming from the studio and director of GiTS SAC/SSS you can certainly expect high production values and the art and animation definitely have some GiTS vibes and as much as the sound was pleasurable to the ears, the art is most pleasurable to the eyes.<br />
<br />
So are you looking for an action sci-fi movie with mecha elements? Then do not over look this one. It even has a little romance too which i love to have in a mostly action movie/series.

    *First Written Review of Anything in the Internet, Ever Warning*<br />
<br />
I need a map to find out where the hell to start with contemplating this masterpiece. And by needing a map, I mean it pretty contextually, because by god this is a very convoluted movie.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t exactly grew up with this show. I had watched an OVA of Devilman a looong while ago. I fell in love with it growing up. Then Cyborg 009 vs Devilman popped up on Netflix. Now, I wanted to give it a go, but I wanted to know about Cyborg 009&#039;s origins before I watched those OVAS. I&#039;m saying all of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270905">
        this because while I didn&#039;t grow up with it, I still visited ALL of it. Their debut OVA in the 60&#039;s. Both colored tv shows from the &#039;79 and &#039;01. Then I watched this movie. So I do understand exactly how drastically they escalated the whole plot.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
I do understand, that the series never had a grimey atmosphere. I mean, it was an actual kids show at first. But this is a reenvision of these characters&#039; universe and a close-up of the insane spike in the proportions of the calamities taking place.<br />
With that being said, there&#039;s many moments where while there were many VERY interesting concepts being presented about our instinctive preservation of mental sanity through religious constructs, and a very heightened climax, many philosophies kept dragging on. Again, I am fascinated by the development, especially the cyborgs not being able to trust each other, but their &quot;hypothesizing/getting nowhere&quot; scenes are. <br />
<br />
-----&gt; 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
The characters were absolutely fantastic. It is extremely hard to make a movie where you have to make 9 main characters likeable. Sure, much of it was prioritized to Joe, Jet, and Francois. But every character has AT LEAST one or more scenes where they just absolutely kick ass...<br />
Except for Pyunma. Man... That&#039;s just... Not cool.<br />
<br />
------&gt; 8/10 Only because Pyunma<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The score is ear-throbbingly gorgeous. They reaally know how to make a scene look as downright badass as possible. Sounds effects were also a thing of notice, with the Accelerator slo mo, as well as Ivan talking<br />
<br />
<br />
-----&gt;10/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
To save you the trouble, if you&#039;re an absolute anti-fan of 3D anime... TRY starting with this one. Even if you hate the plot. Even if you don&#039;t understand any of it. Look. At. This. Art. This is without a doubt, the absolute epitome of 3D anime. It feels so damn stylized, you could swear you&#039;re watching a 24 fps anime. Because it actually is a 24 fps anime. And then you try to analyze how they made 3d art look this amazing in 24 fps. Same CANNOT be said about Cyborg 009&#039;s latest show on Netflix, but that&#039;s another review for another day. Regardless, this is leagues above any other 3D anime to this day, period. Especially if you&#039;re into actual 3D animation like I am. I&#039;m TELLING you. This flashy flick flows flawlessly.<br />
<br />
$10,000/10<br />

Overall<br />

Give it a shot. Learn more about the characters. Star Wars started in Episode IV and no one needed a goddamned tutorial for it, smh.<br />

    The Cyborg 009 series is an outstanding series, however this movie doesn&#039;t quite like up to that. Though the visuals and sounds were outstanding, I had a mediocre experience. <br />
<br />
I understand the apocalyptic theme and if executed well, the story works. However, there are a tremendous amount of holes in the plot that make the entire story make little to no sense.  There were many questions left unanswered about various points made in the story. The is especially directed toward the ending, which made no sense. How did they all end up on a remote island-ish type place? How did they survive? Where did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224776">
        this and that character disappear to? Who the heck are they all talking about? We never get real answers to any of it. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s nice that it all worked out in the end.  I prefer happy endings, except when the story is still very much incomplete. Well, that&#039;s what it felt like to me. It could have been done better. <br />
<br />
Besides that, I love the action packed scenes. They were stunning. The dubs were very good and not hurting my ears, though I may try it in subs in the future.

    Good animation and a beautiful soundtrack ruined by nonsensical ramblings on the nature of God and religion, which I&#039;m not quite sure the scriptwriter knew anything about.<br />
<br />
The animation is good for CG animation. It&#039;s Production I.G., after all. Faces were a bit wonky at times, especially Francoise&#039;s, but nothing really all that bad.<br />
<br />
The music is fantastic, and by far the best part of the movie. It was done by Kenji Kawai, who is well known for his work on Ghost in the Shell and Fate/Stay Night, so the high quality comes at no surprise. On the flip side, the voice work was fine. Nothing really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255854">
        stuck out to me, though.<br />
<br />
The worst part of this whole movie were the characters and story. The story was utterly bizarre. I think it was supposed to be some kind of commentary on religion, but at best it comes across as pretentious garbage written by an edgy teenager, and as borderline offensive at worst. Ultimately, all of it seems entirely irrelevant to a story about cyborg spy-heroes. Characters are almost entirely non-existent. They merely exist to spout more nonsense and make the plot progress. Cardboard boxes have vastly more personality than these pieces of garbage.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t bother watching this movie and just look the soundtrack up on Youtube or something instead. That&#039;s a significantly better use of your time, trust me.<br />

    well this really stands out as a weak point compared to everything that came before it as all the other series kept a similar tone while this says fuck the tone the other series had it wants to be edgy action which makes it feel nothing like a 009 series it has the characters but that is about it<br />
<br />
story 4<br />
the story had a basic action movie kind of plot were they once again have to team up things happen to ramp up until the climax were they have do something to stop many people dying but for some reason the movie also decided to throw

          <span style="display: none;" id="review384448">
        in weird fictional history about similar events happening long ago that really felt unneeded and just wrote in a way were everything connected to that part of the plot felt poorly used<br />
<br />
art 7<br />
i will say it atleast looks good it have a few scenes on destruction that are really eye catching and most of the action looks good and it uses darker coloring to better match the tone it was going for the i do think the art work for the characters suffered a bit they at times just look bad and don&#039;t have a distinctive enough look expected from main characters <br />
<br />
sound 5<br />
 the only thing worth really noting is i felt the voice acting sounded bland and definitely fit what would be heard in a action movie that is trying to be edgy so basically emotion other that maybe anger or emotionless lines  is rare<br />
<br />
characters 3<br />
they feel nothing like the characters seen in pass movies and series the lighter parts of there personality is completely gone Francoise is the only one that gets one or two lighter characters moments but her gentle nature is basically gone and the rest of the characters including 009 are no longer the characters they are expected to be and as a result they feel like a very bland bastardization of the characters that makes me wonder why was it made part of the 009 franchise <br />
<br />
overall 5<br />
this does the generic action plot well enough and eye catching enough to get a five but do to how badly the characterization was handled this is definitely a disappointing entry to the franchise that didn&#039;t know how it wanted to fit in it and doing a good job with how it looks is not enough to hold it together and make it good this is mediocre at best
