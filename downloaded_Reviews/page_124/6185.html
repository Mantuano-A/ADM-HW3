    Now; I&#039;m going to try and write a balanced review for this; all I&#039;ve seen so far are people giving ridiculous 10s or others being stupidly harsh on a show they&#039;ve only watched 1 episode on. These are the kind of reviews that shouldn&#039;t be making front pages and are written by people who shouldn&#039;t be writing reviews at all. <br />
<br />
Upotte!; most &quot;controversial&quot; Anime of the season. Never have I seen so much (unneeded) hate on something so harmless. It seem people just like to hate on an Anime for the fun of it. Here&#039;s a top ten Run Down of the Anime;<br />
<br />
1-  It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60659">
        is NOT a masterpiece. Stop treating it like it should be one and stop rating and reviewing it as if you were expecting it to be the breakout Anime of the year, and then were bitterly disappointed.<br />
<br />
2- It is HILARIOUS. If you watch it with an Objective, completely neutral mindset; you will laugh, A LOT. If you watch it while thinking it&#039;s &quot;moe ecchi garbage&quot; you will not find it funny. Simple as.<br />
<br />
3- It&#039;s very informative; yet it does not take itself too seriously. This show knows exactly what it&#039;s talking about; and it plays with the premise spectacularly.<br />
<br />
4- It&#039;s targeted at a MOE-ECCHI FANBASE. Do not complain about it if you do not enjoy these things. You know what you&#039;re getting yourself into.<br />
<br />
5-However, it&#039;s surprisingly action-packed. Recent episodes have given us very impressive and smart action sequences.<br />
<br />
6- The Art is horrible. You have been warned. There&#039;s nothing good to say about it. At all. <br />
<br />
7- The characters are GREAT. Each character is original, likeable and marketable. I can already see the fanbase being split off into FNC, M14, L1A1 and SIG fanboys. <br />
<br />
8- It caters to everything. Loli-con, Onee-chans, Nekomimi, Moe, Elf, Ecchi, it&#039;s all there. Throw in some perverted jokes and very well done fanservice and you have yourself fap-bait. Remember, MALE-OTAKU audience.<br />
<br />
9- It&#039;s completely original. You probably haven&#039;t seen anything like this. I don&#039;t even know what genre to classify it as. It&#039;s either Genius or Very Stupid.<br />
<br />
10- It&#039;s enjoyable in a very light-hearted way. It&#039;s meant for comedy and ecchi after all. It&#039;s not Shakespeare. But (once again) it is VERY funny and VERY enjoyable.<br />
<br />
There we go. My two cents. We&#039;re all entitled to gives 10s and 1s to what we want; but we&#039;re not entitled to push these opinions on other people. I&#039;m trying to counter the ridiculous reviews out there that are doing a massive disservice to this otherwise very well made Anime. Give it a fair chance.

    Omg these noobs gave this anime a 10... Now before I even start my review I am going to remind people that 10 is the pinnacle of anime quality. Evangelion, Code Geass, Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi, etc. All up there in God Tier Class that deserve such a legendary number as 10.<br />
<br />
Upotte!! = 10 = God Tier?<br />
<br />
[B]What the hell are you talking about?[/B]<br />
<br />
You know you&#039;re talking out of your ass when this fail of an anime doesn&#039;t even make it on the top 50, let alone get over the 7.0 average mark. Still blows my mind to this day. Lol eat me.<br />
<br />
Story - There&#039;s nothing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58445">
        The first episode doesn&#039;t start anything, there doesn&#039;t seem to be any traces of a plot, you can expect nothing from it until the last two episodes where they try to have drama but fail at making me empty my pockets for any fucks I might have left to spare.<br />
<br />
Art - About two years ago I would have said this is some nice art. But give me something I haven&#039;t seen, standards have gone way up and this is not impressing me.<br />
<br />
Sound - pew pew pew, bang bang bang. It wasn&#039;t good enough to make me care what it sounded like.<br />
<br />
Characters - This is actually the most frustrating because there are no characters. You call these things characters? You don&#039;t care what they are, why they are motivated to move towards a goal they have, you don&#039;t sympathize for them, you couldn&#039;t give a crap less if they died in a tragic way, in fact I was actually hoping for them to because I was so offended at how it ever so freaking bored me.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s the first episode and that I should give it time before forming an opinion. It&#039;s all it takes for me to know that these characters are flatter than the second dimension.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Short skirts, boob fondles, bath scenes, talks about thongs but never presented visually, it helps if you&#039;re a big gun fetishist and spend evenings masturbating to AK-47 demonstrations.<br />
<br />
No I did not enjoy this dry excuse for anime.<br />
<br />
Overall - A waste of my life. I could have spent the same time watching or rewatching a better anime. This is not worth it, stay the hell away from it, but if you really have to, be my guest. No review in the world is going to keep you from fulfilling  your masochistic urges to watch such garbage, do whatever the hell you want.<br />
<br />
I give this a 4.<br />
<br />
Protip - Stop handing out 10s like treats at a puppy pound.<br />
 <br />
It&#039;s one of the many rules that keeps me from being an ass and it still is to this day.<br />
<br />

    Upotte!! is cute rifles doing cute things, while teaching Cool Gun Facts™ and pandering pretty heavily to military otaku.<br />
<br />
it does a pretty good job of explaining what&#039;s going on and for the most part the things it teaches you are pretty accurate, but in order to truly understand and appreciate this show and its characters you need to have a relatively solid grasp of firearms, firearm history and firearm culture.<br />
<br />
if you don&#039;t like or know anything about guns then you&#039;re likely not going to get like 90% of it. a bit like watching Hikonin Sentai Akibaranger without knowing anything about sentai shows.

    Upotte is an anime with beautiful premises that teaches us the importance of assault rifles, nah I’m just messing with you, Upotte is an anime cliché that has appeared in several other anime that came out during 2012. As you may have known, we are currently in a sort of era of anime that has lasted for over few years now, right after famous cute comedies such as K-On and Lucky Star came out, I call this era the moe era. In my opinion, Upotte is just one of those anime that try its best to be one of those cute comedy masterpieces, only adding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95731">
        one different aspect that K-On and Lucky Star don’t have… assault rifles and another thing that we see oh so common in anime these days, fan service. <br />
<br />
When I first watched Upotte, I felt as if I was transported to the last few years of my childhood where the big kid elementary schoolers were required to learn about the gloriousness of puberty. And if you don’t know, is not something most people my age probably enjoyed. Upotte ended up using the right amount of strange fan service to make me feel as if I was watching a puberty video on assault rifles, this time mixing the mysteries of the female body with the parts of a variety of assault rifles. As a result, my body was in no way ready and if I was a man, I would probably have as they call, “the weirdest boner right now.”  That my friends were one of the most weirdest and perverted 25 minutes of my adolescence. <br />
<br />
Now there was only one reason for watching this anime, and it was merely to increase the number of anime I watch. But I did something I totally regret when watching this anime, I used my brain. Upotte is an anime that does not require you to use any percentage of your brain in order to understand the plot which in a way is a pro and a con. So when I watched further and further of the anime I just turned off my brain and stared at my laptop probably looking like a hormonal boy when he stares at a girl in a bikini.<br />
<br />
The first half of Upotte mostly focuses on getting to know the main characters in their comedic lifestyle as preteen girl guns. This of course may be quite hilarious and enjoyable for some people; however it was nothing to talk to your friends about. What I mostly enjoyed in this anime were the facts given to us on what type of guns these girls are, and as a result, I can now tell you useless information about the history of these guns. For example, the gun L85A1 was a defective gun created by Britain since they were so behind in military weaponry. Another thing I greatly enjoyed about this anime was its serious moments it has, they are small, but they give you goose bumps. Lastly, the most enjoyable thing about this anime was its childish way of introducing guns. Usually when you think of anime with guns, you’d probably think of a blood bath or maybe a war scene, but Upotte introduces these guns in a very fun and fresh way, while still having action packed moments. <br />
The music in Upotte is relatively peaceful and upbeat, but it is definitely not the best. I didn’t find it to enjoyable and is most of the time skipable. The same goes for the art and animation as well, however, they did add a lot of small and extra details on the weaponry making it look intricate and amazing looking. <br />
<br />
Upotte is one of those anime that are boring in the very beginning, but gets better and better as it progresses further into the story until we hit the climax and it just falls downhill from there, or we just don’t get a real ending where people are satisfied of the outcome. I honestly would not recommend this anime to anyone unless they just want to get some cheap laughs or if their bored out of their mind. But if you do plan to watch Upotte, don’t think. Lastly, I recommend that you do not watch this anime yet if you haven’t gone through puberty or have just started it. <br />

    It&#039;s shit. The only thing it does have going for it is uniqueness, and here that&#039;s not a good thing. I reserved my final judgment until giving this series a chance and now after episode 4 I have come to the conclusion that it&#039;s nothing but horrible.<br />
<br />
All of the characters are generic. There&#039;s nothing likable about any of them. It&#039;s not even worth watching this horrible series for the cute girls doing cute things, you&#039;ll most likely fall asleep from being so bored.<br />
<br />
The anime has a lot of forced drama, random fanservice moments, history lessons.. and by history lessons I mean spending a long period

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60011">
        of time talking about the history of guns used in world wars next to nobody watching this anime cares about.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing special about this series at all. Everything is either average or bellow average. Don&#039;t waste your time on it.

    I know this is still on-going anime and it has just one episode but I think it&#039;s awesome anime !<br />
Maybe it&#039;s just me,but I love girls with rifles ! So if you also like girls with guns or rifles,this anime is just for you...<br />
It&#039;s funny how girls are named by guns/rifles and how the main character is turned on,on her homeroom teacher,but I won&#039;t tell you the whole first episode,it would be spoiler...<br />
I&#039;m just telling you that you should watch the whole anime,because I think it will be awesome and I hope that,too. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean,it can&#039;t be bad cause it has hot high school girls

    Now since only five episodes of Upotte have aired thus far my trigger finger is a perhaps a little bit too itchy, but I&#039;ve had this show in my crosshairs for a while now and I&#039;m just aching to fire out a review. Don&#039;t shoot the messanger here, guys.<br />
<br />
So Upotte is pretty much your typical show with cute girls, but with a twist: because rather than cute girls, they&#039;re cute guns instead. Now I can tell you&#039;re looking at the pictures of the show and saying &quot;Hey Anno, I hate to be the one to shoot you down, but they&#039;re clearly human girls&quot; and all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60959">
        I have to say to that is shut the fuck up and don&#039;t interrupt me when I&#039;m talking to you, jackass. Sure, they look like girls because nobody wants to see a bunch of real guns waltzing around a highshool. Sure, lots of people love guns but even more people love totty. So what could be better than some gun-totting totty? Nothing, obviously.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the two concepts intergrate themselves with one another seemlessly. The characters function just like real life guns do with only a few minor differences. In fact, apart from the fact they cannot fire bullets, the differences between the girls and their real life counterparts is purely cosmetic. Besides, we soon end up glazing overtheir &quot;real&quot; guns anyway (which are delightfully small, as we would expect) and forget about the distinction. It doesn&#039;t really matter though because aside from being the key premise and in a way justifying the shows existance, it really isn&#039;t terribly important.<br />
<br />
Holy shit, I just realised I wrote two whole paragraphs without making any gun related puns, despite that being my true &#039;aim&#039; when writing this quasi-review. Did you see what I did there? I used the word &#039;aim&#039; as one would &#039;aim&#039; a gun towards a specific target, except I meant it like an &#039;aim&#039; as a synonym for a &#039;goal&#039; or &#039;objective&#039;. I know that was probably a bit on the subtle side and you probably didn&#039;t get it, but don&#039;t worry,  it&#039;s not really a big deal. After all, having to explain the origins of a play on words does nothing to diminish the humour of it. That&#039;s why in one episode of Upotte, they spend have the run time explaining the premise behind a pun that was so obscure not even the heartiest of gun nuts and/or sexual deviants could have possibly worked it out. And as soon as they finish the explanation, we all start laughing in unison.<br />
<br />
It may be a shot in the dark since I haven&#039;t bothered to watch anything else that has aired this season, or indeed this year, but I can safely say that Upotte is the best show that I have watched from this year. Which is why I feel sad to see so many of the reviewers here gunning it down, like it was supposed to be taken seriously in the first place. It&#039;s a series about a bunch of highschool girls and guns, what kind of deep premise could there possibly be?<br />
<br />
In summary I would like to say that it&#039;s like a poor man&#039;s Strike Witches. Although since Gonzo went bankrupt I&#039;m not sure that expression is suitable anymore. So I suppose I should put it like this: if Strike Witches is an M4A1 Carbine with Detachable Scope and Underbarrel Grenade Launcher, then we would have to say that Upotte is an M16A2 Assault Rifle with an extended barrel set to burst fire. <br />
<br />
Which is basically another way of saying that it is not as well made as Strike Witches but it fills a similar role, basically that it is action and tits. Well, perhaps not &quot;tits&quot; but thats besides the point. The point is that if you watch Upotte then you will get a know a shit ton more about guns while pleasuring yourself as much you would with any similar anime, that is to say one where the story is unimportant and you&#039;re only looking for fanservice. Or should I say, thats the only thing in your sights... <br />
<br />
I ran out of gun puns, so I had to reload. <br />

    Just mentioning the mere premise of Upotte is probably going to be enough to put the vast majority of people of from watching it, unless you’re the kind of person who has gone through enough classical conditioning to be immune to what ever the minds of the people of Japan could throw up next, then you may as well try to forget Upotte’s name entirely and just leave it at that. <br />
<br />
At a glance Upotte may just appear to be your typical clichéd Japanese school girl anime, but there’s a catch, a safety catch, the girls who appear to be your pretty standard anime school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85983">
        girl aren’t in fact girls at all. Their guns.<br />
<br />
Every aspect of the characters, be it their appearance, nationality, eating habits, what they wear, their relationships with other characters, how confident they are and even how the react to certain environments both physically and socially is entirely dependant on the gun model that they just happen to be. Subsequently, this can lead to a lot of humour of the eye rolling variant as Thompson submachine gun is given large breasts as a result of a large drum magazine and a T91 assault rifle is given a g-string as a result of an adjustable stock. <br />
<br />
It’s worth noting that not all the characterisations of the guns are this perverse, there does exist other parallels such as height dependant on gun type and family relations influenced by manufacturer. This said, more often then not, the aspects that Upotte wish’s to bring to light are often perverse. <br />
<br />
This taken into consideration,  one thing I can assure you is that if you have not had any previous experience either in the military or owning a firearm, then your going to learn about guns, and your going to do so in a way that you probably never though that you would. Beyond the aforementioned character interactions, Upotte often takes the time to deviate away from what plot there may be in the episode to explain gun history, varying ammunition sizes, what purpose certain gun types have and other pieces of gun related information. While it may seem odd to call Upotte educational, given its niche subject matter, odds are you will probably come out knowing more then you did going in.<br />
<br />
But Upotte doesn’t have its sights focused solely on teaching you about guns, as mentioned, this is an anime about school girls and their varying emotional happenings with one another.  The main characters of Funco, Sixteen, Elle and Sig (respectively a FN FNC, M16A4, L85A1 and an SG 550) provide a varying amount of characteristics. Each one has their own strengths and weaknesses ranging from the cocky and brash to the shy and humble. All of the characters are fairly likeable at face value but throughout the series there is very little development to their characters. <br />
<br />
What’s worse is that Upotte has a habit of introducing new characters that serve no purpose other then to fill up time during the episodes, they are incredibly shallow in character and their interactions between themselves and the main characters feel poorly thought out. The only exception to this is Japanese Teacher (note this is how he is referred to through the entire series), a recurring character throughout the entire show and the only one aware to how odd it is that the girls are all assault rifles. His casual interactions with the girls provide some light-hearted comedic moments aside from his interactions with FN FNC which range from dull to emotional in a way that doesn’t quite work. While not a hugely likeable character he does fit quite well into the show as he finds himself questioning just what is normal anyway?<br />
<br />
This said, there is one big draw to Upotte and its characters, at times the show can be very funny, while I’m sure that its type of humour won’t appeal to all, but there where times when I found myself pausing the video to laugh out loud, not because it was so poorly executed but because it was honestly funny. There are jokes that were lost in translation and others that only the most grizzled of gun enthusiasts will get, but there are many that are pointlessly hilarious and unsurprisingly, often involved the imaginative use of guns. <br />
<br />
In contrast to this though, and as a result of this being a show about guns, there are five episodes housing two over arching storylines with an emphasis on action sequences not seen in the rest of the show. The action sequences aren’t really anything to behold, they aren’t animated any better then the rest of the show and most shots really boil down to a character standing still firing a gun. Instead their entertainment value derives from an emphasis on realism, seeing the characters work together as teams to accomplish a goal, executing plans laid out by one another and working around their flaws holds some undeniable charm and the setting contrasts well as it explores the characters enough to further their likeability. <br />
<br />
But as mentioned, these sequences suffer from a similar issue that the rest of the show falls under, an impossibly average animation quality. The animation is rarely ever smooth even in times when the show could easily benefit from it, and during certain frames the characters might appear off model which is also a big downer. This isn’t aided by the mediocre art direction that the show takes, while the gun’s do look nice and it’s quite clear that there has been a decent amount of effort put in place to get them to that stage, the background art just remains purely functional throughout, I never found myself even noticing it, and while this could makes sense from a composition stand point to draw attention else where, the show never takes advantage of this opportunity and suffers as a result.<br />
<br />
Where Upotte really suffers however is in how it’s earned its age rating of 17+. Through out the show there are many scenes taking place in bath rooms. While the interactions between the characters are appropriately casual for good friends, the amount of nudity in these scenes, while never explicit, feels forced and contrast&#039;s with the feel of the show somewhat. This isn’t aided by the near constant panty shots throughout the show which again, feel forced. Other pandering’s to fan service include the unexplained cat ears and tails on AK-47’s, the unexplained dog ears and tail on a Galil and the unexplained elf ears on a Finnish rifle (das racist). <br />
<br />
I understand that such things like cat ears are common place in anime, but the creators of Upotte realised that they could get away with just about anything so long as they provide some half arsed justification for it, in all the cases I mentioned above, no parallels are drawn between the guns and these features so in all cases it just feel&#039;s like the creators where trying to expand their audience as much as possible by appealing to varying sexual fetishes. One scene in particular depicting a sadistic lesbian Sako Rk. 95, contains content of a masturbatory nature and it feels neither well executed nor consistent with the feel of the rest of the show. While nothing on show throughout Upotte’s length can be considered flat out gun porn, the show does dip near to such low’s and consistently doesn&#039;t benefit as a result.<br />
<br />
In short Upotte is not all that great, but what is has going for it you won’t find executed is such a fashion elsewhere, when it’s good, it is thoroughly enjoyable, don’t go into it expecting a masterpiece, but at only 10 episodes long, it’s hardly going to waste much of your time either.<br />
<br />

    Ok, so I&#039;ve just completed watching this 10 episode ONA, in fact it is just right that this anime just be an ONA instead of a TV series, before I go on, how about short gun quiz?<br />
<br />
<br />
1. What is the nick name of the M2 Browning machine gun?<br />
<br />
a. Ma Deuce  b. Big Bang  c. Hitler&#039;s buzz-saw<br />
<br />
2. What does &quot;SAW&quot; stand for?<br />
<br />
a. Squad Automatic Weapons  b.Squad Assist Weapons    c. Squad Advance Weapons<br />
<br />
3.Which unit of the German Wehrmacht that uses the FG42?<br />
<br />
a. The Schutzstaffel     b. The Panzergrenadier    c. The Fallschirmjäger <br />
<br />
3. What is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63011">
        standard size of a NATO round?<br />
<br />
a.5.57x45mm   b. 5.53x46mm  c. 5.56x45mm<br />
<br />
4. Aside from Colt (Formerly Armalite) what other US Gun manufacturing company that also produces an AR-15?<br />
<br />
a. Benelli Armi SpA    b.  Bushmaster Firearms International    c. Smith &amp; Wesson <br />
<br />
5. In the movie &quot;Scarface&quot;  Tony Montana (played by Al Pacino) gave this famous quote &quot; Say Hello to my little friend!&quot; Question, what is that &quot; little friend&quot; that Tony (Al Pacino) was referring to?<br />
<br />
a. An M60 Light Machine-gun  b. An  M203 attached to an M16  c. A double barrel shotgun  <br />
<br />
Ok, now on the serious side, I may have finished this 10 episode ONA, not because I like the story, rather it is the informative side and the Moe that come with it is what kept me from dropping this ONA. So I&#039;m  gonna give the story a &#039;Poor&quot; number 3, since I kinda find the gun pun too corny in fact the comedy genre only revolves around it. Also, mixing the gun pun with some firearms documentary is like mixing oil and water that doesn&#039;t seem to go well, you might say that the author is has more potential of making a documentary for the military channel or in Discovery Science than making animes.<br />
<br />
Art: Good 7.<br />
<br />
I really like the way the characters were drawn, I guess there is that cuteness in them or to be precise &quot;MOE.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: Good 7.<br />
<br />
I simply like the opening and closing theme and the gun shots seems to actually match that of the guns featured in this ONA. <br />
<br />
Characters: Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Ok, I don&#039;t get the author&#039;s sense of humor for portraying the characters asanthropomorphised guns and I really don&#039;t dig as to why there is only one human character there who is the Japanese Teacher, well, that his role, but what does he do................is kinda sketchy, in fact he only had one major climatic role and that is to be a peace maker between the NATO Guns vs the AKMS. Oh and there are other characters that the author seems to forget to include, among them are;<br />
<br />
-QBZ 95 <br />
<br />
-Khaybar KH2002 <br />
<br />
-Sturmgewehr 44<br />
<br />
-FN SCAR <br />
<br />
- And last but not least Japan&#039;s own Howa Type 89 and Type 64<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good 7, Overall: Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Ok, for me it is the trivial gun documentary and some of its fanservice that I find enjoying than the gun pun or firearm gag. Thought, some info provided are a little bit off, it is still worth watching, that is if you are the type who is not only into anime/manga dude but also into documentary watching like something from Discovery and Natgeo. But alas, the overall of this ONA is poor, not something which can be viewed by a well educated dude and it is also something were a die hard anime fan wouldn&#039;t make any heads or tails about it either... more likely he/she will be more focus on the moe that the informative side of this ONA. For me, I would personally wanna meet this ONA&#039;s author Kitsune Tennouji and say to him &quot;Say Hello to my little friend&quot; then bang, bang for him.<br />
<br />
Btw, here are 2 more quizzes for you guys out there:<br />
<br />
- The Thompson submachinegun or M1928  is also called:<br />
<br />
a.Tommy gun   b. Trench Boom  c. Chicago Typewriter  d. All are correct  <br />
<br />
-What is the latest variant of the M14 rifle?<br />
<br />
a. the FL SCAR   b. Heckler &amp; Koch MP7    c. Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />

    I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but I feel like this is an absolute must. As someone that enjoys a fair amount of anime, I don&#039;t think I have ever seen a story this awful. <br />
<br />
The characters didn&#039;t deserve to be put in such a bad plot.<br />
<br />
 The jokes for the most part are good, but the actual content of the anime, and the gimmick of the anime don&#039;t make sense. Without giving any spoilers, there are times where the characters in the anime will do things that don&#039;t make logical sense when considering what they are suppose to be. It feels like the writers had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75773">
        a hard time deciding what properties they wanted to give the girls/guns based on what gun their character was based on. What starts of as a very informative and interesting anime, ends up being far far worse.<br />
<br />
Especially towards the end characters are seen doing things that for the rest of the anime they either could not do, or would be out of character to attempt. This left me with a bad taste in my mouth, after thoroughly enjoying the vast majority of the previous episodes. <br />
<br />
If there was no overarching plot, and was simply an ecchi anime, it would of been great. However they attempt to tie something together haphazardly at the end, that ends up completely ruining what was otherwise an excellent anime. If you want a good laugh, and don&#039;t care about a terrible attempt at story telling, you will enjoy it. Anyone cannot stand plot holes or just straight up nonsensical conflict resolution is better of watching something else.

    Well, this is my first review as I am new to this great resource. So here goes....<br />
<br />
Firstly, I am not a gun enthusiast. However, I have hunted wild game and know my way around a gun. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I AM an anime lover going on eight years now. That said, 14 minutes into the first episode, I was enjoying this original series with full humor while firing short three-round bursts of laughter.<br />
<br />
Some Anime just need to be taken lightly. This series obviously is NOT to be taken, nor does it take itself, seriously. It&#039;s just a fun romp through the &quot;girls with guns&quot; genre that pokes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61285">
        a lot of fun at cliche after cliche while bringing a completely insane premise to bear.<br />
<br />
I read a few reviews and was amazed at the polarization of comments. Quite frankly, I think that is the clue that this is good stuff! In time this will be a classic both in originality and flat out comedy.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the short review, will edit later.<br />
<br />
Okay, so here is a follow-up: six episodes down the throat and I still like this show, especially the personification of guns to character development.<br />
<br />
Without spoiling episode plotting, I will say that the degree of technical detail may put off some viewers, but a little research in Wiki will vaporize that for the assiduous viewer. In brief: chill out and cool your barrels before firing rounds at this Anime. Cute girls that are actually deadly weapons? LOL. Sounds like my last GF, haha. More to come.....

    WARNING! STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN&#039;T SEEN EPISODE 1 YET!<br />
THIS MIGHT BE A BIT SPOILERISH!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This will be my first real review, so don&#039;t burn me down to the ground :)<br />
I started this series without having even read the description.<br />
I must say that made the enjoyment and the surprise even bigger.<br />
The story is quite random but to me it&#039;s very innovative to use this in an anime.<br />
<br />
I gave the story a 10:<br />
The randomness is what makes this anime so good and cool, although I&#039;ve only watched one episode, I already laughed a lot and it&#039;s great to see how the writer thought of this.<br />
It&#039;s insane to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58319">
        pretend girls being guns.<br />
&quot;We all dream of being great assault rifles&quot;<br />
Hilarious XD<br />
<br />
I gave the art a 9: To me it looks fantastic, the graphics look nice and fit the anime, also the guns are being quite good into shape as how they look in real life.<br />
<br />
The enjoyment a 10: the story and everything arount this anime make me laugh and enjoy it a lot.<br />
Not having read the description is the best thing I&#039;ve ever done XD<br />
<br />
Character and sound both a 9: a grabbed the together because I haven&#039;t any actual remarks for the sound.<br />
The characters are put together in a strangely funny way.<br />
Every girl is designated a different gun name with it&#039;s origin.<br />
I think it makes the anime quite cool :)<br />
<br />
Overall: A 10!!<br />
I think this is a very promising anime, it&#039;s hilarious, well put together and has an original story!<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t wait for the the next episode!!!

    Continuing on with girls with guns month, Upotte is an ongoing manga that started in &#039;09. Written by Tennouji Kitsune. In 2012, Xebec, the studio behind Bakuretsu Hunters, Bottle Fairy, Mnemosyne &amp; Rinne no Lagrange, to name a few, released a ten episode ONA based on the manga. I have no idea what to expect from it. So let&#039;s just take a look and see how it compares to their other works. At the very least, it&#039;s probably better than Mnemosyne but that isn&#039;t saying much.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Our tale takes place in Seishou Academy, a school where all the students are guns who can wield their more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238588">
        literal forms. Our protagonists are FNC (nicknamed Funko,) L85A1 (Eru,) SG550 (Shigu,) &amp; M16A4 (Ichiroku.) Things get strange for them when they get a human teacher who doesn&#039;t know much about guns or what to expect. Shenanigans ensue.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the big flaw with the series. It comes across as someone&#039;s fetish project. There&#039;s a lot of heavily sexualised stuff based around the girls being guns. And by a lot, I mean that this anime is almost on the level of Strike Witches. Which is odd both because the girls are guns and because the main cast is in middle school. I&#039;d kind of like to converse with Tennouji to hear them try to justify themselves. But I also don&#039;t because I get the feeling they&#039;re the type who breathes heavily and drools for no discernible reason. Another issue with the series is that there are a bunch of segments that just talk about gun specs. Which is going to be boring unless you happen to have a major gun fetish like Tennouji. The humour itself is pretty lacklustre. While it has some funny moments, they&#039;re over-shadowed by a lot of dumb, predictable jokes. Like FNC shooting at her teacher because he mentions her undergarments. Which he kind of deserves since no teacher should be fixated on that to any degree.<br />
<br />
About the best I can say about the series is that it has its aforementioned funny moments. It also has some nice, cute moments here and there. Usually involving Shigu and her feelings towards Funko.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to say about the cast. In spite of the “twist” of them being guns, they&#039;re a blatantly bog-standard batch for a slice of life series. The interactions with the teacher do get annoying quickly, and the interactions in general aren&#039;t as good for comedic purposes as certain better written slice of life works though.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
To its credit, the character designs are pretty distinct and there&#039;s a lot of detail put into the guns. Unfortunately, it also suffers from a lot of excessive, tasteless shots of the girls in a state of undress and shots that put the focus firmly on their bums and bosoms. Learn how to have class, Xebec. The backgrounds also gravitate towards lazy.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The voice acting is pretty average. They aren&#039;t brilliant, but they aren&#039;t bad either. Which may be more the result of the characters being archetypes without much to them than the actresses themselves. The music was handled by Hashimoto Yukari, who also worked on the composition of Yuri Kuma Arashi, Mawaru Penguindrum &amp; Strike Witches. All in all, it&#039;s decent enough.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There is quite a bit. Shigu is heavily implied to have romantic feelings for Funko, Ichiroku gropes other girls. There are several other girls who are shown to have romantic interest in other girls including Galil AR towards AR18 &amp; both AUGA1 and SAKO RK95 towards Funko.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
So, how does Upotte ultimately hold up? Not particularly well. It suffers from a lot of tasteless, sleazy moments. The comedy is pretty weak. The characters are stock. Ultimately, there&#039;s just not much to recommend it. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week I&#039;ll finish girls with guns month with a look at El Cazador de la Bruja.

    I watched this a few weeks ago but decided I would give my opinion on this...crap.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10, Alright, so the anime focuses around these girls that go to a special school because they&#039;re...guns? Yes, guns. These girls are literally guns in human form; weird. There&#039;s literally no progression except the minute bonding of the girls and their teacher, which in and of itself is completely pointless.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10, I&#039;ve seen other reviews where people complained that the art was &quot;bland&quot;, and I have to agree. There&#039;s nothing spectacular about the art here, unless you&#039;re into gunfire, which is alright I guess, nothing to wet your pants

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202816">
        over though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10, *brapapapapapapapaaaaa!* gun noises and girls making semi-erotic sounds, cool.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10, oh my god these characters are stupid! Literally, there is practically nothing that is appealing about any of the characters or their personalities. No progression, barely any emotion, and just plain dumb.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10, I&#039;m going to tie this one in with my overall rating, which is also a 5/10. The minuscule amount of enjoyment I found was through the semi action-filled scenes where the girls fought against this weird group of people. (Trying to retain spoiling, although after watching I really wouldn&#039;t have mind being spoiled) Also some of the facts that I learned about the guns that the girls were, like where the gun originated and its specs. <br />
<br />
So basically if you want to waste time and watch a really crappy action/ecchi anime, then be my guest and watch this steamy pile of crap.

    Moe x Guns, a wonderfully bland new combination.<br />
<br />
For as long as humans have existed we have sought to further our knowledge and power of our weapons. From ancient times with our tools made of stone and stick we slowly progressed to projectiles. For a long period of time the battle between armor and weapon had become a tug or war. For the most part this war has been won in favor of weapons from our humble beginnings to August 6th 1945 with the first atomic bomb dropping.<br />
<br />
A brief boring history lesson but you really learn more about guns than anything else. Upotte!! is just another

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63195">
        one of those shows that comes along to really disappoint.<br />
<br />
When I first saw this title as an ONA I was fairly excited, simply just because the lack of net original content is at an extreme low. In the end I felt nothing but wasted time and effort on history lessons of guns. What is different is that this tries too hard to make the guns seem like they&#039;re someones baby and that they try and compare human characteristics to guns.<br />
<br />
The story of Upotte!! is non-existent, it is merely progression of these guns as they mature and eventually placed into the hands of a soldier. The references feel almost &quot;Dirty&quot; almost as if the show itself is for a person with a term I like to call &quot;Gun Fetish&quot;. As each episode comes along you have a new gun introduced only to be set into the backstage so no character development occurs. The story and characters are poor at best and the gun to girl comparisons are laughable at best.<br />
<br />
The redeeming aspects of Upotte!! are simply the art and sound. Each and every weapon are almost exact replicas of real world applications. I believe the only real purpose of this was to give some insight on weapons from various countries and their shape, form, and function. When it comes down to gun sound the representation is fairly accurate as modern weapons are no where near as loud as pre-world war rifles. Although, I have to admit the character designs to represent these guns were cute, it wasn&#039;t enough to make me enjoy this show any better with or without them.<br />
<br />
Objectively Upotte!! felt as if it tried too hard to come up with a new moe combination only to fall on its face, but if you&#039;re a gun enthusiast give it a watch.

    First of all:<br />
If you expect watching an animé with a good story, this is not for you.<br />
<br />
The entire story in Upotte!! is as exciting as any &quot;Cute girls doing cute things&quot; animé.<br />
I was gladly surprised that the story is very fitting with the theme. You don&#039;t see girls AS weapons every day, even in animé. It&#039;s a lightweight story, so everyone can watch it, and you don&#039;t need a big introduction to it. This is both a good and bad thing about this genre.<br />
I&#039;m giving the story a 6, as the story is not as surprising, but original nonetheless. <br />
<br />
The art is nothing special, although

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65331">
        I loved the characters expressions, along with the scenery. It was nicely picked, and you had an idea about the school&#039;s proportions. <br />
The light and shading was good in my opinion, but I thought the show lacked a bit animation. <br />
I noticed at some points, that the show was taken away from the actual video, and I really disliked that. I loved the chibi art, as it always makes me smile :3 I&#039;ll give the art a nice 7. <br />
<br />
I loved the voice actors in this, they fit good with the characters. <br />
The battle music and opening theme got me every time, I really liked it. The only complaint I can have, is that the music gets repeated a lot. You hear the same battle music over and over again, and I found that a bit cheap. Taken the shows 10 episodes, I didn&#039;t really mind. The music is being used properly, and I liked it. A good 8. <br />
<br />
The jolly M16A4, along with the shy L85A1 make a good pair, along with the other somewhat original characters. I really liked Galil, and Sako was... well, no spoilers here. The teacher is a nice character, although he doesn&#039;t get any light to shine. The way the characters take themselves serious is HILARIOUS, this is what makes a lot of the show. The characters are very colourful, and it makes this 10-episode ride worth watching :D Characters alone make the show, and Upotte!! has really proven that in my humble opinion, therefore 9.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this show, as it the genre it is. This show doesn&#039;t even take itself serious at all, and I LOVED IT. Either the developers thought it up randomly, or it&#039;s genius. You can&#039;t really tell. I felt that this show covered a lot of themes that are common in animé. Nekomimi, fan service, guns, violence, cheesy jokes, random themes, high school, and so on...<br />
<br />
To sum it up, if you want story, drama, or anything that would make you think the slightest bit, don&#039;t watch this. <br />
If you instead want to sit down with a nice cup of sugared tea along with cupcakes and candy, and enjoy some cute girls doing violence, and perhaps get a good read about some guns.... watch this. <br />
<br />

    Writing a Review for Upotte!!<br />
=====================<br />
Will be writing a paragraphy by paragraph review first, scroll down lower for a broken down version (by category)<br />
<br />
In my experience of this anime, I was really put off by the first episode, It gives you that impression that it&#039;s going to be some sort of Harem over the Japanese Teacher. Of coarse it isn&#039;t even though the synopsis on this site will lead you to think so, (The first episode made me drop the anime for two weeks). The first episode can be treated as an introduction to the characters but is not really that important, (Skipping it won&#039;t do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187673">
        much harm)<br />
<br />
Upotte!! is a sort of comedic-informative anime about guns, While watching expect to laugh and learn a few things about guns, Another thing about this anime is that it is ecchi (perverted). Though other than what happens in the first episode it is quite tame. <br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t anything to be wow-ed over and would&#039;nt really be the main selling point of this anime, Removing the jokes and ecchi scenes from this anime would reveal how boring/plain the story is. But they did well to cover it up, Going into this anime with a neutral mindset will allow you to enjoy the anime for its very cute main characters.<br />
<br />
The character&#039;s personality can be linked slightly to what gun they are. The art style is nothing new or unique but has been done well enough <br />
<br />
(One complain though, These guns have horrible aim when they are under pressure.It was a bit annoying to see when they perform so well in practice)<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
Review divided into categories<br />
<br />
Story : 6/10 : Honestly the story isn&#039;t all that interesting and the story in each episode can be found in almost every &quot;day-to-day*&quot; adventure anime. <br />
<br />
Art : 8/10 : No complaints about the art style, meets a standard quality that allows the viewer to enjoy without a problem. (If you read my other reviews, I rate 10/10 for unique art styles that are well done).<br />
<br />
Sound : 9/10 : Personally as long as the sounds are there and syned with the animation&#039;s I have no complaints, The voices are well done and really fit each character (Japanese Dub) the sound effects are strange in a few scenes in my personal opinion.<br />
<br />
Character : 7/10 : The character&#039;s are well designed in aim to please the different types of preferences people may have for anime girls, Though in personality we the viewers know very little about them. Other than their specs and attitude towards others, we know very little and that may cause a certain discontent from the viewers. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 7/10 : Honestly had a good laugh while watching this anime, Though the first episode put me off from watching it for awhile. The rest of the episodes did well in giving me a laugh and some information about guns. <br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
I hope you find my review helpful

    Welcome to an anime about guns, girls with guns, guns with guns, girl on girl action, and guns that are girls. Yes, that’s right. This anime is about guns that are anthropomorphized into girls… which are then armed with guns. (GUNCEPTION). How does this make any sense? I have no fucking clue. However, once you get pass this ridiculous setting, you can enjoy the rest of this anime without any problem. Since logic went fuck all over the place. <br />
<br />
If you are looking for a serious anime, then you are definitely looking in the wrong place. This anime is set in a ridiculous tone so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69849">
        that it “doesn’t” have to take itself seriously. It is a light hearted anime based around a bunch of innocent… guns, that go to school and have fun. *Insert* this scene  http://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/boards/cgl/img/0059/91/1341093426988.jpg<br />
<br />
“Woah, wait wait wait… did that girl just masturbate in the middle of a firefight? What... the fuck.” <br />
<br />
Yes, this anime is well deserving of an ‘AR-18’ rating (pun intended), as there is a good amount of fan service, thongs, sexual innuendos, implied yuri, and just straight up yuri. Where every gun in the district apparently wants to ‘bang’ the main character (lol puns). Sorry, couldn&#039;t resist.<br />
<br />
However, that is what you should expect while watching this anime. There are a lot of gun puns spread throughout that attribute to the anime. Even the title itself is a play on the Japanese word for “Gun”. And the great thing about puns, is that they’re so god damn awful, you can’t help but laugh. <br />
<br />
If you want to get a feel for what this anime is like. Just imagine high school, but with guns. As far as the story goes, there isn’t one. At least, there’s no main storyline that it really follows. The episodes can be about, snow days, firefights, field trips, or school festivals. This lack of overall plot aids in the pacing of this anime. As a result, you lose track of “what episode you were on” and just enjoy the anime for what it is, pure retardedness. <br />
The final arc felt a little off however, as they tried to set a slightly more serious tone, and the final villain coming out of seemingly nowhere. The anime really isn’t given a proper ending. However, seeing as the manga is still publishing and the episodes are completely random as fuck, there is a potential for a second season. Or at least, more OVA’s. <br />
<br />
In the end, if you’re a fan of guns, girls, yuri, or god awful puns. Then this anime is worth checking out. It is filled with trivia on guns ranging from information on; ammunition sizes, classifications, weapon parts, weapon maintenance, fragmentation, what were to happen if you fire a subsonic round through water, and whether or not M-16 can grow a dick on her head. If this genre of anime appeals to you, then go ahead, check it out, you’ll have a ‘blast’. (ok I’ll stop now)<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoyed this review, and as always, thank you for reading.<br />
( And remember) <br />

    An interesting, if half-baked story in which various types of military assault rifles are personified as Junior High School girls.  If that doesn&#039;t make sense, then congratulations, you&#039;ve just recognized the major flaw in this anime&#039;s story design.<br />
<br />
What is nice about the overall story is the characters -- we have the core 4 girls, who have to learn to work together and rely on each other in various contests, even though as weapons, their reliability and usefulness vary depending on the environment of the battlefield.  There are a number of other girls, all personified weapons, who either come to their aid or function

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211946">
        as opposing forces.  Oddly, with all its fan service and PG-rated joking about breasts, their are no male love interests in the entire series.  There are a few innocent scenes between Funco and her Sensei (did we ever learn his name?) but it never went anywhere.  This series was more about girl-hood, school friends, trips and summer vacation than is is about guns and ammo.<br />
<br />
In the end, the series attempts to provide an anti-war lesson, but it was poorly delivered and it is doubtful that younger viewers will be able to sort out that message from the more pervasive &quot;glorification of weapons&quot; message that the series really was mostly all about -- the &quot;gun otaku culture&quot; as others have mentioned. <br />
<br />
In closing I will say that the final OVA was the best segment of the entire series.  It focused solely on the main four characters as they spend a few days camping in the woods.  Really made me remember my childhood where I did something similar myself.

    The girls are named after the guns. By the way, the name of the guns are similar to some guns named in Counter-Strike. I have played Counter-Strike when I was young and the players are equipped with guns which are almost similar to the guns in anime. For example, M4A1 <br />
<br />
However, the plot and character come off as generic. Nothing special about them. The sex joke for example like masturbation is just not fun at all. I really just don&#039;t know what to say. The art and animation is all right.<br />
<br />
It is really sad that there is no character that is memorable. I was basically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103645">
        interested in the concept of guns in Counter-Strike which the anime has done. However, this anime is full of wasted potential.
