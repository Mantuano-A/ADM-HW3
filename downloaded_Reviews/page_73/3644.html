    Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a highly perverted ecchi harem anime. If you don&#039;t like that kind of thing, you might as well stop reading right now because this show is not for you.<br />
<br />
That being said, Monster Musume is *not* a generic anime however. Rather it has a quite fresh take on the genre with a very unorthodox character cast which indirectly makes the ecchi elements very unique. It&#039;s very creative for a fanservice anime, and thus manages to stand out from the crowd quite a lot. As a result, Monster Musume is one of the more noteworthy series in the ecchi harem genre.<br />
<br />
First

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199228">
        of all though, I&#039;d like to make a general statement here. Given how many complaints you see about how many bad ecchi harems there are nowadays, have you ever stopped to ask yourself what exactly it is that makes a fanservice-oriented ecchi harem *good* then? Of course this is an entirely subjective question, but personally I can think of a number of things as signs of one. I&#039;m going to go through them one by one and then compare Monster Musume&#039;s performance to those standards, and in that way analyze the contents of the anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. A good ecchi harem should not have any sort of cheap excuse story. Such a plotline is only going to suck anyway so don&#039;t even try.<br />
<br />
Monster Musume&#039;s premise is rather simple. Due to a new law, various kinds of monster girls have been allowed to move to human countries as long as they are taken care of by a human host. This is in order to see if different species are capable of living alongside one another in the future or not. And thus the story is about an ordinary guy who gets tasked with taking care of a bunch of sexy monster girls of various species by cohabitating with them. Unfortunately for him, it&#039;s still highly illegal for humans and monster girls to mate with each other, and thus he has to muster up all the mental strength he has in order to resist the girls&#039; rather forceful attempts at seducing him.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s about all there is to it. No complicated overarching story, no &quot;dark past&quot;, no stupid out-of-place action scenes or anything along those lines. Just plain and simple lewdness in a comedic setting. That&#039;s all it is, and that&#039;s all it needs to be. If you watch an anime for the sake of ecchi... well then you don&#039;t need much more than ecchi as long as it is executed properly.<br />
<br />
2. A good ecchi harem requires some sort of originality. There needs to be something to make the anime stand out, otherwise it will only come across as generic and repetitive.<br />
<br />
Monster Musume&#039;s heroines are very unique, for obvious reasons. We have a lamia, a harpy, a centaur, and tons of other species making up the female cast of this show. While this is unusual in and of itself, it also provides an almost infinite possibility for creative fanservice. Since different characters have completely different body parts, physical abilities, reproductive functions, and views on common sense, we end up with a show which has sexual content that I can guarantee that you&#039;ve never seen before in an ecchi anime.<br />
<br />
3. A good ecchi harem should have a respectable male lead. We don&#039;t want an annoying pervert, a spineless coward or a rapist feeling up the girls exactly.<br />
<br />
The protagonist of Monster Musume is called Kurusu Kimihito, and while there&#039;s nothing remarkable about him, I still consider him to be a pretty good harem protagonist. To start with, he is reasonably mature, and manages to keep up with all the girls advances fairly well... as long as he&#039;s physically capable of resisting them that is. He&#039;s also got a rather admirable personality and simply feels like a good guy all-round.<br />
<br />
4. A good ecchi harem benefits greatly from having well-written and likeable heroines. You&#039;re going to be way more interested in seeing a girl you really like strip for you than a girl you couldn&#039;t care less about do the same.<br />
<br />
Here I think a distinction needs to be made: I already clarified that the heroines of this anime are very creative and unorthodox. However that is solely because of their physical appearances and the high potential for fanservice which comes along with that fact. But that is also the only thing which makes them special. As far as personality, character development and simple likability goes... they really don&#039;t have that much despite everything. Of course you might argue that an ecchi anime doesn&#039;t need those elements, but I&#039;d like to disagree. Would you feel exactly the same if your girlfriend did lewd things to you as you would if your girlfriend&#039;s identical twin sister did the same? I&#039;m going to say no. I think that if you like someone on an emotional level then whatever erotic things that person does would come off as way sexier. And for the same reason, despite their interesting physique, the girls of Monster Musume fail to establish any deeper connection with the viewers, and thus are unable to live up to their full potential in terms of eroticism.<br />
<br />
5. A good ecchi harem must absolutely have good art and character designs: When your goal is to make the heroines appear sexy, they should obviously look good as well.<br />
<br />
Monster Musume&#039;s art looks fantastic however, so there is no need to worry about that. While it looked good in the manga, I think it looks even better in the anime due to the crisp and vibrant colors. Everything looks incredibly clean and detailed, and consequently all the girls also look amazing.<br />
<br />
6. A good ecchi harem should have intense enough ecchi elements to actually be hot, at least if it&#039;s a fanservice-oriented one such as this. Just some minor teasing every here and there just doesn&#039;t cut it, it&#039;s too softcore.<br />
<br />
This category is rather hard to properly analyze as of yet in Monster Musume&#039;s case, because unsurprisingly the TV-airing of this anime is censored. As usual, you&#039;ll have to wait for the BDs to see this anime in all its naked glory. Though I have to say that the censorship in Monster Musume is very tastefully done compared to what I&#039;m used to seeing. There are almost no light rays, steam/smoke or weird graphics blocking up the screen in this anime. Instead they resort to having nipples just barely blocked from the camera by having objects in the way, or zooming in the camera in order to leave the NSFW elements just barely outside the edge of the screen. These actions can then simply be reverted on the BDs. As a result, the censorship doesn&#039;t really distract you when watching the show, which is something I appreciate very much.<br />
<br />
Censorship aside, Monster Musume has a lot of quite high quality lewdness. Although I doubt I&#039;d use it as fap material exactly, I&#039;ve definitely gotten some hard-ons while watching this show, and I think that speaks for itself pretty well.<br />
<br />
7.  A good ecchi harem should also have sexual content with appropriate timing. Don&#039;t throw in random panty shots when it doesn&#039;t make sense or the mood just isn&#039;t there; the story should support the fanservice, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Given that the girls&#039; relentless sexual assaults on the protagonist is one of the core elements of the entire story, the ecchi segments are most certainly justified and believable for what they are. Of course some scenes might be a bit more far-fetched than others, but they never feel poorly timed or distracting from any other aspect of the show.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you put all that together, I think Monster Musume passes every single category except for #4 (#6 can&#039;t really be judged properly yet though). And that is the only reason I&#039;m not giving this a higher overall rating than I am. I think what Monster Musume really needed to have in it is a girl like let&#039;s say Momo from To LOVE-Ru Darkness whom in addition to being sexy also has an enormous impact on the entire story as a whole and makes every moment more interesting. But it doesn&#039;t, and as a result Monster Musume eventually starts feeling somewhat repetitive. It basically runs on a &quot;girl of the week&quot; type formula where new monster girls keep being introduced to the cast and their unique ecchi potential is investigated. But once that is done... well then the characters don&#039;t really feel very interesting anymore because again, they don&#039;t really have anything going for them beyond their physical characteristics, and thus many of them are just tossed aside afterwards. And because of that I feel like the show lacks longevity.<br />
<br />
However that being said, this is only a 12-episode anime, and it still certainly manages to keep you interested for that long at least. If it had been like 50 episodes long then it would probably have been a lot less impressive as a whole, but for what we&#039;ve gotten thus far I don&#039;t have very much to complain about overall. Monster Musume is one of sadly few ecchi harem series which actually tries to think outside the box and deliver a fresh viewpoint on the genre as a whole. It&#039;s both fun and exciting to watch, and almost never fails to make you smile when watching it. And really... I don&#039;t think you can ask for a whole lot more than that from an ecchi harem anime.

    Watching an anime about monster girl harem seemed  to be a horrifying prospect as I sat down to try to watch this, only to be able to say how horridly stupid it was. But wow how positively surprised I was, as this was actually unbelievably funny and i hadn&#039;t had such a good laugh for ages.<br />
<br />
The story is quite simple, there is a new program implemented  that allows fantasy beings to come to our world as some sort of exchange students. Our main character agrees to take in Mia, a lamia, that means she is half human half snake. She immediately falls in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199244">
        love with him but the problem is that sexual relationships between humans and monsters are forbidden. Then slowly he gets to care for many more beautiful monsters that fight over him. Anyway the story is nighter original nor particularly interesting, but the comedy is done so well that it is easy to ignore the lack of a good story. The ending episode was in my opinion a bit weak as there was no meaningful conclusion, but at the same time that hints towards a second season, which I am looking forward to.<br />
<br />
The character are great, our main character is this average Joe, a bit dense but he has a very good heart. He wants to help his guests in any way he can and is also one of the only people in the show that sees them as normal people and not as monsters. His guests are all great, everyone is not only a great deal of fun, but they all have distinct personalities that make for some great interactions. There is only one other important character in the anime and that is agent Smith. She is the cultural exchange coordinator that is responsible for our main character getting all these girls and also for keeping an eye on him. She is shown as very manipulative and is always in control of the situation, whatever it may be. <br />
<br />
The visuals are great, the girl, look distinctive and very cute, even if some of their body proportions are a bit exaggerated and some of the fan service does cross the line of good taste a few times. The backdrops are detailed and the animation is silky smooth. As the show contains nudity I have to say the censored version I saw was censored so well I would not have noticed it, had I not read about it somewhere. There are a few fabulously funny effects that fit in perfectly. I especially liked our main characters eyes that appear completely white or most of the time and that gives him a distinct clueless look the fits in perfectly with the anime, but when serious moments arise he gets his normal look back. The soundtrack is decent if not especially good and the opening and ending are both very listenable if a bit boring after a few listens.<br />
<br />
My final score for Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a low 8, which might be a bit high but it is such a great deal of fun. I have to say that out of all of the anime I was watching as they were airing, this has to be the one I was looking forward to watching it the most. Would I recommend it to everyone? Of course not, but if you are looking for a good laugh and are not going to mind a bunch of fan-service.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
It is somewhat difficult to review a show like Monster Musume, because it isn&#039;t just “run of the mill” bad, but rather mystifyingly bad. This is an echhi harem anime that decided to change 1 basic element of the formula and make all of the girls &quot;monster girls&quot;. This is a series where ecchi lovers get to try masturbate to a snake girl, Quelaag from Dark Souls, a centaur, and MANY others. Since one of the MAIN points of a harem series is audience wish fulfillment and wank material, the girls are always highly attractive and appealing. This series completely torpedoes that goal unless it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202923">
        was made for about 25 people on deviantart. So it must be a clever subversion of the harem genre and a biting satire right?...right?  <br />
<br />
Plot and characters:<br />
<br />
The government decides to randomly reveal that mystical creatures have always existed, but had been kept a secret since the middle ages and people simply forgot that they were real. Many monster girls travel to Japan allegedly to study Japanese culture, but actually many are looking for a human to mate with. The Japanese government heavily frowns on these &quot;interracial relations&quot; and even founded a government department to prevent them from happening. Our male lead is an average guy named Kuruso that received a monster exchange girl (snake body with human torso) as a mistake. He is very kind to the snake girl Miia and even defends her honor from some random xenophobes by beating the living shit out of them! Then the series quickly goes further downhill because more and more monster girls join and the series becomes extremely predictable and generic. During the first few episodes, you have lines like, “Japanese citizens don’t seem to actually like us foreigners, but they are usually polite because it is expected”. This is one of the things that leads me to believe that initially the writer actually wanted to use comedic satire to address xenophobia in Japan. However, there was either executive interference or his train of thought simply got derailed. Monster Musume almost immediately surrenders on any attempt to make a product with any value or purpose whatsoever. It just trudges along the tired and worn out path of harem clichés until it reaches an arbitrary point and just stops.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art is fairly decent, but unsurprisingly it is nothing amazing. This is yet another giant tits anime that tries to milk money out of the Japanese buyers by releasing an “uncut” DVD, which is the EXACT same footage with a couple nipple shots added in! This has become a horrible new trend in anime similar to excessive DLC in videogames. If the entire purpose is to show tits, then just show tits! Don’t expect buyers to fork over extra money just to see your poorly drawn boobs!!!<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Monster Musume has a sickeningly sweet and rather obnoxious soundtrack that I couldn’t recommend.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Maybe I am just being overly optimistic, but I feel like somewhere in this pile of shit, there was an idea for a decent satire or perhaps a parody/deconstruction that could have at least been halfway decent. However, those seeds were planted in toxic waste and obviously had ZERO chance to bloom into anything worth looking at. At least I almost laughed a couple times, so I have seen FAR worse!<br />

    Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, otherwise known as, &quot;Everyday Life with Monster Girls&quot; is probably as generic as it gets when it comes to ecchi harems. It has the typical nice guy, the girls that fawn over him and everything that make comedic harems a genre. None of that discredits Monster Musume for what it is though and for it to take those simple generic ideas and hit all the &#039;right&#039; buttons truly makes it its own.<br />
<br />
Whether it be changing the girls to &#039;monster girls&#039;, twisting the personalities to an extreme, adding sexy but hilarious interactions with the MC and girls or trying to build

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199304">
        a world where society is slowly accepting these new sub-species all come into play; The anime hits all the right notes to make it something more than a typical harem and does it in a phenomenal way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (7/10):<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t as engaging as it could be, but it sets itself up to be interesting enough with plenty of laughs to follow it. One thing that does get somewhat lost as the show goes is the idea that there&#039;s sub-species mixing in the show. We only follow one character whom is dealing with it, but it gives viewers a glimpse to all of the pros and cons that come with this &#039;mixing&#039;. Just as cultures and other nationalities mix there can be prejudice, mockery, but at the same time fascination and acceptance. Monster Musume only touches lightly on the subject, but as the MC himself soon learns things aren&#039;t just as simple when you&#039;re living with a person of different species every day. As Monster Musume touches on their daily lives and sometimes trials, but still manages to flaunt some boob shots in there while still keeping focused on the story at hand. It&#039;s a complicated idea &amp; story made simple; For what the author intended to make it works out very well. More importantly to some, it stays very true to the manga save for perhaps one part of the anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (9/10):<br />
<br />
One of the more enjoyable aspects of Monster Musume was its attention to detail when it came to art. The art is very colorful and vibrant while keeping some top-notch quality animation going at all times. What makes it especially great is the &#039;range&#039; of quality they utilize throughout the show. One scene can be completely breath-taking, but once we&#039;re kicking it in to comedy they lighten up the &#039;tone&#039; of the characters&#039; looks (Mainly the MC) to match with the scene. It works and fits very well while sometimes even purposely making things look strange for the sake of a great joke (Looking at you cabbage).<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10):<br />
<br />
Whether it came to the music, quality of the voices or simply just noise they saved no expense to deliver great sound. The voice actors were top-notch, every VA had spot-on fit their characters&#039; personalities and whether it was imitating sounds from games, anime and so-forth (lots of references to other work) the sound was spot on. <br />
<br />
Character (8/10):<br />
<br />
This is where I think Monster Musume shines the most. Again, going back to what I had said at the beginning of my review, Monster Musume takes the cliche personalities that many harems have and makes them their own. The classic tsundere, the clutz, the &#039;pure girl&#039;, dominatrix, and company are all twisted and shaped by the author to justly fit our new monster girls. What they&#039;ve essentially done is take a generic personality and &#039;did it right&#039;. After all, the reason why these personalities are so prevalent in the anime and manga industry is because of how well they were received and created; Unfortunately, many anime and manga recycle these personalities without doing anything extra to them. They essentially copy/paste from one anime to another, but what&#039;s great with Monster Musume is that it takes that classic &#039;pure girl&#039; and makes her into as pure and dutiful as some knights. That doesn&#039;t catch your interest? Well, let&#039;s take our kind and thoughtful rich girl, but make her a huge addict for tragedy and so-forth. While they&#039;re not original, each girl has their &#039;own&#039; personality, which holds the show quite nicely. Even the main protagonist, whom is the biggest cliche of all is a breath of fresh air. The MC is nice and kind to all of the girls as one would expect, but is bold and doesn&#039;t back down when actions need to be taken. It&#039;s a trait, that oddly we don&#039;t see enough exhibited enough as many harems have taken to the &#039;thick-headed&#039; nice guy whom can never take a hint. Each character compliments one-another and will have you rather enjoying every one of them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10):<br />
<br />
While Monster Musume may not have the greatest of stories or strongest of characters it delivers itself well just as it wanted to be. A silly ecchi harem &amp; it does so well. There was laughs, moments of intensity and tons of fan-service which oddly felt like just the right amount for what it was aiming for. They were able to recreate the manga very well and there was always something interesting happening whether it would be a hilarious game reference, fan-service (Which you get plenty of), intimacy, conflicts or even just day to day activities.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10):<br />
<br />
Monster Musume does what it intended to do from the start, which is to entertain. It never took itself too seriously and that really carried it to be something more. Whether it was ecchi, comedy, forwarding the &#039;plot&#039; or anything else it did it was always enough to just keep you amused, but it never tried anything to betray your expectations. It&#039;s because of how Monster Musume carries itself that I feel it deserves to be scored as such. We&#039;re not looking at the next evolution of ecchi harem or anything that can shake the foundry of the genre; We&#039;re just looking at some great entertainment, just remember to enjoy yourself. Who knows though? After all, we were just spectators taking a peak at what it&#039;s like to live everyday with Monster Girls.

    Monster Musume is exactly what you think it is.  Our friends in Japan have crossed over into new levels of perversion and fetish anime.  Well kind of.  Its not like the whole monster girl + human boy has not been done before, but its never been done quite as creepily as this one.<br />
<br />
The premise of Monster Musume has been done, and done, and done again.  And done again,   in anime dozens of not hundreds of times before.  Guy lives alone and within the span of a few episodes finds himself living with 4 or 5 girls of various

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207246">
        personality types.  Shenanigans, boobs, and crotch face plants ensue.  The difference here is that all our girls are not human.  And I mean really not human at all, with the exception of their enormous cow udder tits.<br />
<br />
This brings me to what I found to be the most disturbing aspect of this show.  Sure we have seen plenty of non human characters in anime before, history is full of adorable cat girls, fox spirits, and intergalactic space princesses.  But they always felt more human than animal.  This is not the case with Monster Musume.  We have half snake, horse, spiders, and mermaid girls.  With the whole premise being these girls are seeking marriage with our indecisive hero, one can only shudder at the reproductive implications of a man mating with a horse...<br />
<br />
Everything else about this show is decidedly average, at best.  While there are a few amusing moments the experience suffers from a familiar problem of harem type shows.  An enormously bloated cast of girls.  Nearly every episode introduces a new monster girl making any character development pretty much impossible beyond basic tropes and stereotypes.  The characters are likable but I failed to form any sort of emotional investment in any of them and could care less if anything happened to them.  Kurusu sort of stands out when compared to other harem leads in that he isn&#039;t a complete pussy despite the fact he vigorously protects his chastity as would the most pious monk.  Though perhaps we can feel relieved that he does considering the disturbing implications of it. <br />
<br />
Artistically the show is pretty average.  The girls themselves are well drawn and look (a bit too much) like their animal counterparts.  Though most of the girls have ridiculously enormous breasts that frankly aren&#039;t even all that attractive.  The overall quality of the BluRays was alot better than the TV release, as one would expect, but nobody is winning any awards here for animation or backgrounds either.  The voice acting and OP/ED songs were good and definitely the best part of this anime.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this anime to anyone.  Even the most ardent fans of harem shows will find little to love here.  Only those with the most hardcore monster girl fetishes need apply.  Instead just go check out something better like Rosario+Vampire for your monster girl fix, sans the creepy bestiality.

    Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, an unexpectedly amazing &amp; very unique title that has lots of men buying tissues and lotion, than merchandise for the series.<br />
<br />
Story 6.5/10<br />
<br />
The story and plot was more of a prologue. The lack of major backstory about the monster girls homes &amp; origins coupled with the quick introductions were another reason why I felt like this was just a prologue. In addition to that, the characters being introduced one by one and the story, by the last episode, feels like the start of the real story. It&#039;s overall presentation was pretty strange. There is no real character development nor is there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226572">
        any &quot;set plot&quot; for episodes in Monster Musume. What I loved most about the story is that it manages to be a good amount of sexually arousing along with being both fun &amp; exciting! I like that the story, although a bit choppy, focuses more about having fun and really getting into understanding the bizarre lifestyle that Kimihito has to endure now that he&#039;s been forced into the whole human and monster living together program, thingy... In my opinion it sort of makes an interesting story, although not great, still interesting enough to watch. Considering how much this show is being talked about among-st mostly males in forums, I don&#039;t think Monster Musume is going out of style anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Sound 6.5/10<br />
<br />
Interesting, nothing too special though. I did enjoy the opening &amp; outro songs because they were catchy.. Hey SMITH-SU.. the background music unfortunately, none of the songs stood out too much, audio fell flat for the most part and the erotic scenes, the music, sounded like generic stock music. I didn&#039;t think the composer did a great job making the soundtrack.  Now the voice actors, if it wasn&#039;t for them then I would&#039;ve given the soundtrack a 6.0/10 however I&#039;m kind of glad that&#039;s not the case. The seiyuu&#039;s involved with this series did a phenomenal job bringing the characters to life. If Monster Musume has its well deserved season two then I would hope that no changes to the voice actors are made. The actors are able to synchronize their voices perfectly in order to fit the characters unique personalities. I give the most credit and  respect to Junji or Kimihito&#039;s voice actor because he has had experience with titles similar to this. Roles were he has to go over the top with his voice, for example making crazy noises, yelling, moans etc. I was more impressed with the voice actors than anything else in the sound department.<br />
<br />
Characters 8.3/10<br />
<br />
Perhaps one of the best cast of harem characters I&#039;ve seen lately! In my opinion Monster Musume&#039;s strongest appeal factor is the characters. If you like harems, and love monster girls, then Monster Musume is the show for you. I didn&#039;t dislike any of the girls on the show.  The MC however was so one-sided in personality that he sort of dragged the other characters back. Personally I don&#039;t even have a favorite character because deciding who is best is just too much to bare! (Yes, boob puns intended.)  Overall I enjoyed the characters. I would assume by reading this you&#039;ve already established that though.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation 8.7/10 <br />
<br />
Perhaps the biggest reason to watch the show (if you&#039;re into Ecchi) is how well the character designs are. While the proportions of the female characters were a bit over exaggerated, it doesn&#039;t negatively affect the qualities of the characters. They are monster girls so of course their bodies are different. Nonetheless, Okayado character designs for Miia, Rachnera, and the bunch of adorable monster girls were perfection. The animators who brought his designs to life did an excellent job making them appealing for all viewers.<br />
The animation would be the second best thing. Special effects used in many episodes improved the feel, the mood rather depending on what characters were being shown. From the first episode we see Kim&#039; and Miia waking up, together in bed. The sunlight in the room, the lighting, it really makes the settings have a realistic feeling in an already fantasy world. My personally favorite effect would be the episode where Miia decides to go all metal gear solid&#039;s Snake. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall feeling 8.6/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment was a main goal in the entirety of the monster musume anime. Keeping the viewers entertained by wild and erotic means is perhaps the best thing about the show. Having fun, letting loose, and making the best of a bad situation is a few things that the series offers with pure adult entertainment being it&#039;s key ingredient for it&#039;s success among-st fans. Give it a watch, it&#039;s pretty damn enjoyable!

    I believe that a &quot;Masterpiece&quot; is something nigh unobtainable. Something more than an entertaining diversion. And above all, something that exemplifies its genre.<br />
<br />
Monster Musume is a Masterpiece of soft core monster porn.<br />
<br />
And it is porn, don&#039;t delude yourself into thinking that this is something else. But personally I like porn so I can&#039;t hold that against Monster Musume. <br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t really anything special, its your standard ecchi harem fare. Guy meets multiple girls and gives them a place to stay. Once some of the characters are introduced there&#039;s a minor mystery plot introduced and that does a decent job of keeping things varied. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199261">
        kind of show is character driven anyway so having a so-so plot didn&#039;t really effect it too much.<br />
<br />
The Art was excellent, and not in a sarcastic way. It was pretty tame, but all the girls looked sexy/cute/lovable which is a major feat considering they are literal monsters. And the animators got creative at times when the scene called for it. The last episode in particular was very fluid, and better than 95% of Monster Musume&#039;s ecchi cohorts<br />
<br />
The sound was ok. Nothing really stood out in a good or bad way. The girls all sound cute, but no seiyuu really stood out. The OP is great though, definitely my favorite of the season.<br />
<br />
The characters are where this show really shined. For such a large cast, it was great how varied each of the girls were. You could go a few sentences of description of their characterization before getting to &quot;oh and she is half spider&quot;. I liked the MC as well, most Harem MCs get action just for being nice like thats some sort of accomplishment. But in &quot;Darling-kun&#039;s&quot; case being nice to the women IS actually admirable as most of them could kill him at a drop of a hat. The MC&#039;s ability to look past that really brought the show together.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. Are you kidding? Look at Papi, JUST LOOK AT HER. More jokes landed than missed their target, and there were plenty of scenes that had me laughing out loud. The writing was good at making comedy and very human drama mix in entertaining ways. This show gave hundreds of nerds a new fetish and how many shows can you say touched that many people&#039;s hearts<br />
<br />
Overall I really loved this show. Lerche knew exactly what they wanted to do and accomplished it as well as it could have been done. 10/10 Papi best Harpy

    Where do I start with this one? I know, it is GOD AWFUL. Now I don&#039;t know what I was expecting when i started but what i got was... not even bad. That&#039;s a insult to bad anime. This is on par if not worse than &quot;School Days&quot;. Yeah I said that. The main Character has about as much personality as a Cardboard Standee of a Brick. The show is oversexualized to the point where even hardcore fans of the ecchi genera are turned off. The plot is non-existent. And there are scenes that can be considered borderline rape. Have I finished this? No. Do

    What is there to say about Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou? It’s like walking down a dark corridor and seeing a cute girl but then realize that she isn’t so cute. The emphasis in the title is ‘monster’. The word itself implies that the show is anything but normal. And you would be right. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou (Everyday Life with Monster Girls) is what I would describe a rather bizarre harem with lamia, centaurs, spider, mermaid, slime, and everything else you won’t ever see except in fantasy. Forget the myths. In this show, everything is damn real.<br />
<br />
It’s easy to say that is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199227">
        show for everyone. To start off, we have the main male protagonist named Kimihito Kurusu. In his world, the government has made society realize that monsters exist. Their goal is to hopefully allow humans and monsters to co-exist. And in order to do that, they created a program where some humans will live with monsters. It’s like a cultural exchange program and apparently, Kimihito ends up with a lamia named Miia by accidental fate. This doesn’t seem to be a nuisance for Miia though. The first few episodes easily establishes the fact that she is in love with him. It’s not hard realize why considering Kimihito’s kind personality and willingness to accept her as who she is. For someone like Kimihito, it’s also easy to see why other girls would fall for him easily. Perhaps because of this reason, Ms Smith modifies his house as more and more girls keeps coming to his house like pouring rice.<br />
<br />
By diversity, the show is actually quite colorful. The first half of the show introduces the majority of the main cast (as shown on the poster). We have monsters like harpie, centaur, slime, mermaid, and even a sadistic spider. Each episode makes time for these girls to get acquainted with their newfound life and exploring relationship with a human; in this case Kimihito. However, the show itself easily adapts with the lustful intentions of the girls. Miia is especially prone to get jealous as more girls enter Kimihito’s house. She’s also an opportunist who tries to take every chance to seduce Kimihito. I think by end of the first episode, the show easily accomplishes the generic tropes of a harem. What it does do unconventionally is the fact that the girls aren’t human. This is where I mention that the show is really a hit or miss for the audience, as a non-human tries to get into a physical relationship with a human. That sounds a bit creepy to be quite honest but the show does make light comedy out of this despite the heavy fan service. This is because of Kimihito’s comical reactions and the fact that like most harems, usually something goes wary. Kimihito’s personality often sees him “reject” the girls’ advances out of both his nature and because of the government’s established laws. (monsters gets sent back to their country for consummating in a relationship with human)<br />
<br />
So what should you expect out of Monster Musume? It’s almost like it’s poking fun at harems because of its unorthodox ideas. The concept of monsters being part of human society and then having them experience a new lifestyle feels awkward. The show also seems to isolate the setting to Kimihito’s house as the exchange program implies that most people are not well suited to live with a non-human. In more dramatic angles, there’s also heavy implication that society holds prejudice against monsters or at least a sense of fear and disgust. Certain humans treats monsters like they are outcasts and literally what they are, monsters. In extreme circumstances, the monsters retaliate through violence such as a robbery. Although played comically in nature, the show still makes its point that monsters and humans co-existing is a near impossible idea. <br />
<br />
Thankfully though, the show is much more influenced by comedy and humor rather than some cringe worthy drama. Thanks to Ms Smith, who introduced Miia to Kimihito, he experiences new wonders in his life. Ms Smith herself is more of a comic relief as she is lazy although responsible when the time calls for it. She is also part of a team known as “MON” that gets their own spotlight in some episodes. So in general, do expect a little bit of action besides the sexual innuendos on a daily basis. However, the show itself is never shy to turn that on. Every episode will have the monster girls behave in a rather lascivious way, with their own personal reasons. The most obvious is because they are in love with Kimihito but some others are more innocent such as Cerea and Harpie. Maybe it’s because they don’t have an understanding of what being in a relationship is about. Unfortunately, the show plays around with itself too much and nothing concrete is established in the end. And being a harem, the show has a tendency to often create the ‘will they or won’t’ situation. Most times though, you will see the cockblock moment that’s nothing short of being generic. The plus side is that the show does this more amusingly than most harems. This is performed by the monster girls’ characteristics such as Miia’s tail, Harpie’s claws, Cerea’s centaur body structure, Suu’s slimes, or Rachnea’s spider webs. The show also makes Kimihito seems like he is invulnerable. Why? The guy takes injuries that normally would kill a human yet usually ends up fine by the next day. I guess in a show like this, Kimihito gets a free past to stay immortal. There’s also the fun part at how the girls reacts to him when he is caught in perverted situation. This is considered ironic considering that they often wants to get into his pants. So in a nutshell, this is a harem but strikes peculiarly with the non-human supernatural twist. <br />
<br />
Treat this show as a fan service gift. Anyone who is familiar with harems or likes the type of anime that’s saturated with fan service will definitely notice the immense amount of it. The emphasis put into the show is that the girls wants Kimihito. And to show that to the audience, each episode will have many moments where the girls intentionally or unintentionally showing more of their body than they should. The fan service art is of course peculiar considering that their body structure aren’t human. Thankfully, censorship is rather light (except in some shower and bath scenes). In other words, expect heavy amount of actual fan service to service the fans. The animation quality of the show is also surprisingly fluid including the backgrounds and colors. Finally, the show retains the manga’s reactionary faces. The iconic “O_O’ face of the main protagonist is shown many times while the girls often over exaggerates in ways of their own.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is less noticeable. OST is mostly fine but nothing outstanding in particular. Given the nature of the series, voice mannerism is more often the highlight. In particular, it’s reactive to each of the girls’ personalities such as Harpie’s childish nature or Rachnea’s sadism. Kimihito’s voice is rather dull because he is the most normal person in the entire series. But if there’s something abnormal, it would be both the OP and ED theme song. Highlights of it include the monster girls in decorative wedding dresses or the MON making their entrances stylishly. In retrospect, the overall execution is so-so.<br />
<br />
I’ll say it before and I’ll say it again. Monster Musume is not a show for everyone. It’s comically enough for entertainment and sometimes can be even sweet with the peculiarity of the series. However, the story is more of a mess. It fails to adequately develop the characters and has a hard time elaborating on how the story will end involving the monster girls’ relationships with the protagonist. The overemphasis on the girls trying to seduce Kimihito is a recycled concept that occurs almost every few minutes in each episode. So be prepared for that. Despite this, the series’ humor is downright fun. It has this sharp comedic timing and lets us get to know each of its characters well enough to miss them when they&#039;re gone.

    Monster girls, monster girls everywhere. Imagine if they could be a part of a harem series with one lucky guy forced to take care of them by law. What&#039;s that? The word harem immediately makes you instantly gag just from trying to enunciate that term? I don&#039;t blame you. Great harem shows as of late have been a dime a dozen, besides the ones that were and are already in continuation. When new ones crop up, they do not add anything that is new or exciting, just more and more formulaic as time goes on. So what is to be done to amend this curse?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201955">
        Put in cute and sexy monster girls in it, of course!<br />
<br />
It is possible to add a new element to an anime from a specific genre and succeed in giving a modern edge to the anime. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a prime example of something like this succeeding at a level that I did not think would be possible. If Monster Musume, hypothetically speaking, did not have monster girls as the harem and it was just normal girls, I don&#039;t think it would&#039;ve had as much as an impact. Unlike human girls, monster girls have abilities from their bodies and state-of-mind that can create all kinds of unique jokes and sexy situations that you wouldn&#039;t find in a typical harem show. This uniqueness is where Monster Musume has a lot more going for it in its humor and story. New scenarios involving monstrous entities with tentacles, wings, and other strange things all add something interesting that we aren&#039;t used to.<br />
<br />
On the topic of the story, there is not really much to say about it other than the fact that it involves a slightly exciting world of monsters being integrated in the human world. The only issue I have with it is the fact that it does not really explain it very intuitively to the point where I just kinda nodded off halfway through. But from the way the show portrays itself as a silly harem/ecchi anime, it clearly knows how ridiculous it is and runs with it. Hell, even the title itself is translated as, &quot;Daily Life with a Monster Girl.&quot; Which is what most ecchi/harem anime should try to strive for when developing a story of this nature.<br />
<br />
I will briefly go through one by one of each character, since this is after all a character-driven anime based on how good the girls and male protagonist are. There are a lot, so bear with me for a moment. For starters, Miia-chan, the lamia snake-like monster, is by far the best one out of the rest. Thanks to the adorable voice of Sora Amamiya, her caring and cute personality is infectious to say the least. Not to mention her &quot;darling&quot; catchphrase is one that I can&#039;t preface about how heart inducing it is. Papi, the bird-like harpy monster, is the bootylicious loli of the group who has some pretty hilarious moments due to her childlike curiosity. Cerea, the centaur monster, is probably my least favorite but she is still quite enjoyable with her humorous attempts at trying to be noble and knightly to her master.<br />
<br />
Suu, the humanoid-like water goo-ish monster, has a peculiar essence about her from how she interacts with the characters. Because she can&#039;t speak well to people at first, we see her grow up with everyone and starts to learn how to become an adult later in the show. Her morphing technique and almost drowning the protagonist with her own body is pretty amusing to see. Meroune, the mermaid monster, does get a bad rep as being the worst girl but I would have to disagree with that assessment. I&#039;ve always enjoyed seeing her wanting to get married to the protagonist and her attempts at seducing quite alluring in more cases than one. Finally, we have Rachnera, the giant spider monster, who is easily the 2nd best out of the bunch. Mostly because of her entertaining sadism towards the characters that makes her unique among the harem. One scene involving a dullahan and her is especially noteworthy, which I won&#039;t spoil for those who are not aware.<br />
<br />
Our protagonist, named Kimihito Kurusu, is surprisingly one of the highlights of the show. His brash and commanding attitude is a breath of fresh air compared to other harem protagonists who do not have the same level of bravery among females. Not only that but his actions that involve helping the girls from being downtrodden in human society, in particular one scene involving him punching monster bigots so hard that they fly through the door, make him quite likable in this regard. He does have his dumb moments here and there but in context to the situation at hand, they fit well in a comedy scenario where he does not have much control over a bunch of monster girls that are completely different from human girls. He is not even an overly perverted protagonist who we would all root for like Tomoki from Heaven&#039;s Lost Property or Youto in Hentai Ouji, but he manages have a subtle sexual interest that comes up at the right time.<br />
<br />
My only big issue with the cast is the fact that we do not get to explore the supporting cast as much as we&#039;d like. Sure there is Sumisu who has great moments involving the supervision of Kimihito&#039;s care for the girls, but I do not get the same feeling with the other characters. The MON (Monster of a Neuro) squad, in particular, has this problem. There might be one episode where Kimihito goes on a date with all of them, but other than that it was hard for me actually to give them any thought compared to the main girls. It&#039;s apparent that they will explore them more in the 2nd season, and I hope that that is the case. One exception to the supporting cast is Lala, the dullahan monster, who has one of the most memorable moments involving her head and a separate body in the entire show. Again, no spoilers, but it&#039;s worth seeing Monster Musume for that alone.<br />
<br />
From a technical standpoint, Monster Musume&#039;s art assets are pretty good from how shiny and colorful the character designs are. I also enjoy the funny character face reactions whenever there is something lewd, scary, or surprising happening every time they happen. The backgrounds, however, are not something to write at home about. It is quite plain and average to see on-screen most of the time. There is the issue of the OP/ED music. The OP is okay; I liked the chorus of the girls chanting &quot;Monster! Monster!&quot; at the beginning but the rest just felt underwhelming.  Same with the ED, although I tend to question how it fits with the tone of the show at all. I know it features the monster squad, which are the action characters of the anime, but it felt like an ED to an action anime overall, not a comedy/ecchi one.<br />
<br />
I had read the Monster Musume manga a little before getting into this, so I was expecting much of what I got. And what I got was enough for me to say it was an entertaining harem that reminds me how harem shows can be incredibly enjoyable. All you need is to add a different spin to the genre, and Monster Musume proves that you can do that successfully. Is it a game-changing spin that will change it? Not at all. There&#039;s so much add to the genre, but so little for it to be anything but enjoyable escapism.<br />
<br />

    Harem is a genre that has been well versed in anime and has historically been known to be a hit or miss genre.  A good harem can be considered as one where the characters are complex and have more to offer like themes or storylines than just a bunch of girls liking the same guy.  A bad harem on the other hand can be considered as platonic and rehashed, focusing just on the way the girls are and not adding anything more than just tropes for personalities.  And then we have Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, or Daily Life with Monster Girls,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199255">
        a show that tells you the entire gist of what it&#039;s going to be in the first 5 minutes of its runtime.  <br />
<br />
Story: So, what if you lived in a world where creatures in mythology actually existed?  What if you found out that the noble centaurs of Greek Mythology or the ice-cold Yuki-onna&#039;s of Japanese Mythology actually existed in your world?  Well, that&#039;s the kind of world that our main protagonist Kurusu Kimihito (or his nickname, Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss.  I&#039;ll get to this later) lives in.  In accordance to the Extraspecies Law, non-humans are allowed to live in normal human society as long as they are with a family that allows one in their home as a &quot;host family.&quot;  As a host family for an &quot;extra-species&quot; as these characters of mythos are called, we peer into the life of the poor unfortunate soul as he lives his Daily Life with Monster Girls.  (Hey, that&#039;s the title of the show.)<br />
<br />
MonMusu, as the shorthanded name for this show is, is a very basic show.  As expected given the show&#039;s title, MonMusu is a show that features our main protagonist with his Daily life with Monster Girls.  It has a very slice of life feel because every episode doesn&#039;t necessarily progress with any sort of story, following more of a day to day style of story.  There isn&#039;t any major developments or any sort of world-ending situation (that is irony, in a sense.) to make the show more interesting.  It&#039;s a very basic show that relies solely on the way the characters interact with each other and the comedy that it produces in order to create the entertainment that this show provides.  There isn&#039;t any thought-provoking moments, there aren&#039;t any dramatic scenes that break the relationships apart, it&#039;s just a normal, average, daily life show, with monster girls, ecchi, and near-death situations.  <br />
<br />
That brings me to the comedy of the show.  MonMusu branches its comedy from three different sources.  The ecchi, the characters&#039; personalities and the way they are, and the near-death situations that Mr. Darling gets into.  <br />
<br />
MonMusu utilizes what I would consider as a relatively good mesh between those three kinds of comedy.  For the most part, every comedic scene involves some aspect of ecchi, character traits, and near-dying situations that make MonMusu unique to a lot of other harem.  Yes there are a lot of boobs and clothes flying everywhere but they are also moments of characters showcasing their personal traits and difference from just being a normal tsundere or dandere.  They also accidentally threaten one man&#039;s life while trying to seduce him half the time, so keep that in mind.  They have boobs and a potential death happening all at once.  (There&#039;re also quite a few references in MonMusu to other things too.)<br />
<br />
In the end, MonMusu isn&#039;t a very complicated show.  It&#039;s a daily life show that fully supports itself through the use of its unique blend of comedy (which is really up to what you think is funny) and relies on its characters in order to pull itself through.  The base story isn&#039;t all that unique, and the comedy does sometimes just go into straight up ecchi, but it does live up to what it wants to do as an anime.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/-  Unique blend of ecchi comedy  (This is the main draw of the show aside from the characters.  Positive or negative highly depends on your views on ecchi and what is funny.)<br />
-  Overused base story idea<br />
<br />
Characters: As I have stated before, MonMusu&#039;s entire runtime is based around the characters of the series.  With most of them being both female and not exactly human, let&#039;s start with the main reason people watch/read this series, the girls.  <br />
<br />
As expected, there are many girls in MonMusu because it is a harem show.  Since we have six girls and I&#039;m too lazy to analyze each one of them, let&#039;s just give you a quick overview of what they are and their major trait.  (Those with a &quot;*&quot; are my favorites.)<br />
<br />
Miia:  The first girl of the series who is a Lamia.  Very possessive of Mr. Darling like a lovesick city girl and is terrible at cooking.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Darling.)<br />
<br />
Papi:  The second girl of the series who is a Harpy.  A literal birdbrain who has the mind of a child; loses her memory after walking three steps.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Goshujin.)<br />
<br />
Centorea: The third girl of the series who is a centaur.  Very noble and wishes to protect Mr. Darling while also very shy on the inside; has the second biggest boobs in the series.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Anjiro-dono.)<br />
<br />
*Suu: A slime who is the fourth girl of the series.  A very versatile and seemingly innocent character who has a pension for molesting everyone.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Master.)<br />
<br />
*Mero: A mermaid who is the fifth girl of the series.  A mermaid with a very royal aura who is obsessed with tragedy and is slightly masochistic.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Danna-sama.)<br />
<br />
Rachnee: An Arachnee (spider-woman) who is the sixth girl of the series.   Acts like an older sister to the other characters and loves tying people up with her strings.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Honey.)<br />
<br />
Every main girl in the series possesses quite a number traits which set them apart from just your average tsundere or what have you.  Aside from MonMusu&#039;s brand of comedy, the girls are the major draw for the show and as such, are more pronounced than what you would normally expect from a generic harem, which is honestly, really nice.  <br />
<br />
And then, we have the main protagonist of the series.  Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss, or as his actual name in the series is, Kurusu Kimihito.  To be honest, out of all MC&#039;s in harem anime history, Mr. Darling is the one guy who is purely plot device.  Hell, I haven&#039;t even been referring to his actual name much in the review, and they don&#039;t even do that in the anime.  (Only the manga even mentions his name, and it&#039;s only like two times.)  As for personality, Mr. Darling adopts the general trait of being nice to all of the girls, accepting every single one of them even though they aren&#039;t technically human, saying they are a girl first before anything else and puts their needs above his own.  And...that&#039;s really about it for him.  As a character, he&#039;s not as pronounced as any other of his co-stars, with his only role in the series to be not only the target of everyone&#039;s affections, but also to be a human ragdoll.  As I have mentioned before, a lot of the comedy in this show comes from putting this guy on death row.  Because each of the girls have various assets that make them particularly dangerous (Talons, snake constriction, literal horsepower, ability to breathe water, etc...), Mr. Darling often get put on the hot seat amidst their spites and as such, is thrown around, crashed through doors, flown through the air, drowned, suffocated, what have you, to the point that this man is unfazed with the possibility of getting hurt.  (Poor guy)  Even so, as his only real purpose in the series, he is treated as a plot device rather than a character in the series.  (And if anyone is wondering why he doesn&#039;t bang anyone, it&#039;s because the law prohibits mating with extraspecies.)<br />
<br />
As for side characters, MonMusu mostly just has a small group of characters that show up every now and then rather than a huge, expansive cast of people that dip in and out of the story.  Mostly this consists of the government agent &quot;Smith&quot; who keeps in touch with Mr. Darling every so often (and steals coffee), as well as her cohorts who are also monster girls.  Aside from them we have other one off monster girls who contribute to the story slightly, but really only serve as plot devices for a specific part of the story.  (Oh yeah, and there&#039;s Lala.  She&#039;s not really all that important, lol.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Actually unique harem girls  (I mean...no other series has a snake or a slime as part of the harem.)<br />
+ Small side cast that are almost as detailed as the main cast<br />
-  MC is a literal plot device<br />
<br />
Art:  Produced by Lerche, a studio well versed in the ways of comedy, MonMusu has a very bright style of animation using a bright color scheme to give off its sense of lightheartedness for the series.  The art itself is rather well detailed and doesn&#039;t change much or waver in quality whenever the show decides to stay in its standard animation.  <br />
<br />
Though, since this is ecchi...let&#039;s talk about that, why don&#039;t we?  As for ecchi, MonMusu is produced with many a breast falling out or exposed somewhere, as well as a lot of, well, movement for them.  As MonMusu is very pronounced in ecchi, there is quite a lot of censorship for the series and for the most part, is actually rather well hidden since it doesn&#039;t JUST use steam or random bright lights, although they do use them very often.  Just be prepared to witness a lot of pleasured faces, boobs, and stripping because that is just a normal day for Mr. Darling over here.  <br />
<br />
One thing that I have to mention for the art is also its comedy.  Using quite a few exaggerated expressions for characters, mostly having the eyes (mostly Mr. Darling&#039;s) be nothing more than white circles with a sketch outline, the show delves into this style of animation a lot in conjunction with its standard animation to highlight what comedy and what is not.  (Mr. Darling&#039;s actual eyes showed up way too often though.  Should&#039;ve just been white circles for all but 12 times.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Consistent, high quality animation<br />
+ Good integration of comedic art style<br />
+/- Lots and lots of ecchi.  (This varies with your view on Ecchi as a whole.)<br />
<br />
Sound: As for its soundtrack, MonMusu has actually quite a bit of musical score that make it a very, very memorable soundtrack.  Let&#039;s start with its opening &quot;Let&#039;s Fall in Love&quot;, where the six main girls in the series singing various parts of the entire thing.  The OP is a very catchy song with the six girls singing about their love in conjunction with its very upbeat tones.  It represents the show perfectly as the entire song is about the girls and also the danger that Mr. Darling is in.  <br />
<br />
As for its ED, MonMusu employs a very different style of ED with rather than a catchy song like its OP, has a rock-style song sung by agent Smith and her extra-species subordinates which gives a very different style of music for the series.  Personally, I would put the OP first, but it is still a pretty good ED.  <br />
<br />
And for special mention, MonMusu also has a pretty memorable background song to the series.  Played during certain sexy or risque moments in the series, there is a certain track that gives you a sense of what you&#039;re going to expect by using the violin and playing chords to let you know something very sensual is going to happen.  (Thought it was a nice touch.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Memorable soundtrack<br />
-  Not exactly a soundtrack that is filled with masterpieces  (Memorable =/= masterpiece)<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  MonMusu as a series has become one of my more favorite series in recent years.  As someone who actually enjoys harem, to me, seeing this adaptation come to life has been one of the bigger highlights for this season.  Plus, I actually find this show to be both funny and enjoyable.  (And Mero and Suu are best girls.  Fight me.  :p) <br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this anime?<br />
<br />
You know, this question shouldn&#039;t even be here.  Yes, I loved this anime.  (10/10 enjoyment factor from me.)  Lerche did amazingly by basically following the manga to the letter for the chapters that it did translate, and even did little character bios at the end of every episode to explain the extraspecies that are featured on the show.  (Nice touch.)  It was fantastic seeing some of my favorite scenes in the manga come to life and overall, seeing the characters that I adored come into anime form. <br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
It ended.  Next question.  <br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re as gung-ho about harem, ecchi, and comedy like I am, go for it.  If not, I would tread carefully about watching this show.  It&#039;s a show that purely serves as perverted  entertainment and nothing else on account of its brand of comedy and its overall setting and genre that it&#039;s placed in.  As much as I may gush over this show, this show is not for everyone, and unless you are ok with an excessive amount of ecchi, then maybe you shouldn&#039;t consider watching this.

    This anime is an ecchi harem. This is what it is and that is why you should watch it. This harem does ecchi harem is the way that ecchi harem is supposed to be done. It puts a main character who has features about him that are like able but not to the extent that every girl he looks at would fall for him and then has every girl he looks at fall for him. <br />
<br />
This genre works like any feel good genre. It simply presents you with what you want to see. The thing is what we want to see isn`t always hentai. Now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199268">
        a lot of people might be asking why wasn`t this anime just a hentai. Well why does everything ecchi have to be a hentai. There`s enough hentai I think this anime is fine for what it is. It`s a perverted anime but few people don`t feel good when watching a harem or a romance that is reasonably paced. This is just kinda a romance that skips over the boring stuff. That is not necessarily better than a romance since the boring stuff is character development which makes the pay off better but sometimes you just don&#039;t want that. Sometimes you want to turn your brain off. Its like the gurren lagan of romance. Also it&#039;s rare that you find a ecchi harem that actually has a somewhat decent message in the sense of don&#039;t judge a book by its cover (although the payoff for following this might be somewhat out of proportion). But ya all in all it was a solid ecchi harem. Nothing revolutionary but serviceable and among the slogs of nisekoi and jitsu wa watashi this is a nice breath of fresh air

    (This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
I am attracted to beautiful women. A bit of an avant-garde statement, I know, but it is true. I love the curves in their figure, the lushness of their hair, and the succulent, full lips that rest on their faces. It is genetics; it is in my nature to look at a woman I find stunning and have my instinctual desires start to churn.<br />
<br />
Recently, though, it has been a bit…weird. Lately I find myself saying, “I like a woman with a long, scaly, and red tail.” Sometimes I tell others, “A girl who can decapitate herself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205462">
        is the one for me.” And other times it is, “If I can sit on her back and she can still gallop through town, count me in.” My friends are bewildered and my browser history is ashamed. Of course, my newfound fetishes emerged thanks to Monster Musume, an anime about lamias, Dullahans, and many other women of the fantastical and mythical variety. It sounds odd – crazy even – but if loving monsters is wrong, then I do not want to be right.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
At its core, Monster Musume is nothing more than an “ecchi”, comedic anime. It does not have deeply philosophical themes that challenge the mind nor does it have a complex plot filled with intricate patterns. But because it does not focus on the latter details it can strictly focus on the former, allowing it to constantly exist in its own element.<br />
<br />
One such element is the branching out that occurs. It is understood that there are specific women who obtain the majority of the attention. These “haramettes” are (in order of appearance): Miia, Papi, Centorea, Suu, Lorelei, Rachnera, and Lala. For the most part, the girls are given fair distribution; the amount of scenes they receive is proportionate to their point of inclusion within the show. Arguably, Miia gets too much and Lorelei does not get enough, however since Miia is the “main” girl and Lorelei is a mermaid with a niche interest, these differences make sense contextually. Monster Musume does not stop there, though, choosing to showcase a variety of other monsters. Cyclops, giants, and doppelgangers are prominent, and to a lesser extent dragons, dryads, and dogs. Obviously the anime centers on the main cast instead of the side cast, but having more monster girls outside of the staple offerings makes the situation more reasonable rather than a set of special circumstances that just so happen to revolve around Darling. In fact, due to the interspecies mandate, having a range of different monsters coincides with the literal societal shift.<br />
<br />
Granted, “monster” is not entirely correct. The women are a combination of a female human and some known creature. Indeed, if each girl was completely genetically monstrous, the anime would tread into shady territory. The anime understands this distinction, flip-flopping between normal and unique “ecchi” content. Clichés like the girls falling into erotic positions or wearing skimpy bikinis are present; tried and true but not necessarily welcome. It is when Monster Musume focuses on its unique element – monsters – that the door is held wide open. One scene has Miia, a lamia, getting help with shedding her skin, arousing her and the audience in the process. Another scene has Papi eating ice cream like it was fellatio because her wings cannot hold the dessert. Another still has Zombina the zombie lop off her breast, forcing Darling to stitch and to play with her body. It is undeniably ridiculous but that is the edge Monster Musume has: the ability to tap into unknown and unheard-of fantasies.<br />
<br />
But the show, like the women, is two halves: one part perversion and one part hilarity. Similar to its “ecchi” brethren, the comedy finds strength when it incorporates it with the monster qualities of the women. Meaning, while overreactions and misunderstandings are standard fair, when Suu becomes Godzilla after consuming chemical waste or Centorea eats carrots that cause her to go into a longwinded speech about taste bud sensitivity, the latter moments are inherently funnier since they stick with the show’s shtick. Furthermore, the “ecchi” and the comedy are not mutually exclusive. Darling ogling at Rachnera’s long legs and Lorelei disguising herself as a bodacious maid to fit her dreams are designed to make the viewer smile in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
The rest of Monster Musume’s features are also a dream in that they are there but not really. A subplot of marriage is mentioned to string events together but is never at the forefront. The “world building,” or cultural information pertaining to the monsters, is provided as single sentences during speaking or as separate snippets at the end of each episode instead of explained throughout the season. Ideas like be kind to others, do not be ashamed of who you are, and so on, have their heart in the right place but are not explored outright. In other words, what surrounds the anime’s “ecchi”-centric, comedy-dominant, monster-filled center is fluff, stuff that means little to the show and therefore the audience. But this fluff acts as a cushion for the anime, allowing the lewdness and the laughs to rest in a figurative comfort zone. Scenarios can get heavy – Miia getting kidnapped, Centorea getting cornered, etc. – but the show makes sure to spin the situation back towards its roots – the man who kidnapped Miia is found to be a woman after she is stripped (“ecchi”) and Rachnera appears to terrify the evildoers attacking Centorea (comedy). In this way, no matter where the anime veers, the path it takes inevitably leads back home.<br />
<br />
So, does Monster Musume question the self or invest in time travel? No, it does not. However, it having some solid “ecchi” and comedy, mired in a monster motif, is definitely difficult to deny.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Monster Musume, perhaps surprisingly, is quite strong when it comes to its art and its animation.<br />
<br />
Art within the anime is top-notch. Lighting and camera angles in particular are given a lot of attention. The latter is especially noteworthy, considering the size of the monster girls; their bodies are often concealed to refrain from showing them (production resource management) but also as a means to maintain emphasis on the women and their human selves. It is a strange notion, considering that the main appeal of the anime is the monster aspect, but the decision is twofold: attraction (since looking at Papi’s chicken legs constantly is not provocative enough) and reconfirmation (reminding the audience that, at the end of the day, these are still females). Smaller details such as changing the time of day, moving between Darling’s comical and sincere face, and first-person perspectives make the anime dynamic in its presentation and therefore higher in its execution.<br />
<br />
Monster Musume also includes a large quantity of styles. Minimalist portraits, overly detailed paintings, and creepy depictions intermittently pop up throughout the season, spicing up the package once more. The styles are mostly used for comedic purposes, but the constant switching keeps the show on its toes (or contextually, its tails, talons, and hooves).<br />
<br />
Luckily, the anime refrains from switching to overt censoring. Many shows opt for steam or magical light beams to mask the nudity on screen, but Monster Musume cleverly constructs its scenes in ways to maximize assets and minimize hiding. Nipples are often missing, hands cover genitalia, and objects living in just the right spots conceal anything that is slightly too forward. Some scenes do use the noticeable black cloud that is common in the medium, but it is rare and reserved for those over-the-top shots. More often than not the anime leans on the camera once more, showing the scene but cutting off part of it, leaving the rest up to the imagination of the audience (and the BDs).<br />
<br />
The character designs are likewise imaginative, unique to say the least. Miia the lamia, Lala the Dullahan, Centorea the centaur, Rachnera the spider, Suu the slime, Papi the harpy, and Lorelei the mermaid. When looked at closely, each character’s design corresponds with their monster origin and personality: Miia is clingy, Lala is delusional, Centorea is honorable, Rachnera is dominant, Suu is childish, Papi is dumb, and Lorelei is tragic. That is to say, their respective designs already inform the viewer what type of person each girl is.<br />
<br />
Individually, they look the part. Miia’s extremely long and scaly tail, Rachnera’s spider body complete with skull and six red eyes, and Papi’s blue wings make it easy to distinguish what monster they happen to be, but it is the small details that add up. Centorea’s wears a ponytail, Lala has a scythe-like hair-do, and Lorelei’s fingers are webbed, indicating how intricate the designs truly are. And perhaps most important of all, each woman is attractive, with faces and bodies that simultaneously please the audience and question their sanity.<br />
<br />
Actual animation remains above average for nearly the entirety of the show. Breasts jiggle, characters fly, and hair moves, breathing life into the cast onscreen. But as it was with the character designs, it is the smaller details that give the anime strength. Tails wag, eyes shine, and waters lap, putting the show, like the events, in a constant frenzy.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
It seems unfathomable that anyone outside the women of the main cast would be more interesting. After all, they are half-female-human and half-monster. Arguably, though, it is Kimihito Kurusu who stands out the most. Technically he does not stand out at all – most people do not even know that Kimihito, otherwise known as Darling, Master, or Honey, is his actual name – but that is precisely what makes him so special. Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters. Besides his name, he is: incredibly strong, impossibly kind, and inviolably resilient. He is a virgin, he accepts everyone for who they are, and he has a past that is not exactly the peak of popularity. Plus, he can cook. Everything about him is meant to make him this dull, generic mass that anyone can relate to. The main purpose is to allow the viewers to take part in the stereotype Kimihito’s character is named after, specifically self-inserting themselves into his position so that they can feel as if they are the ones receiving the affection of the women. But Kimihito is extremely bland; he has no outstanding qualities whatsoever. Most self-insert characters, despite what they are intended to evoke, have something unique about them to differentiate their existence from within and without their show. Yet Kimihito does not follow this trend. In a certain sense, his unbelievable amount of plainness makes him a nonfactor, which in turn makes his character surprisingly clever. His palpable blandness accentuates the women, highlighting their bizarreness beyond what it already is. This keeps the spotlight on Miia, Lala, and the rest, his presence a shadow in the night. The result is more of what makes Monster Musume itself: more “ecchi,” more comedy, and definitely more monsters.<br />
<br />
Monster-wise, the women are obviously attractive, their personalities and mannerisms designed to get the audience wanting. In fairness, that is not their entire directive. Indeed, a peculiarity about them exists. Dichotomies can be drawn between their monster origin and their personalities, much like their character designs. Miia is the sweetest person when dealing with her Darling but vehemently venomous when anyone gets in-between her and him. Lala the “death god” is only so due to her “chuunibyou,” thereby making her the least dangerous of the troupe. Centorea’s dignified self makes her the most prone to shyness. Rachnera’s teasing reveals how much she understands other people. Suu and her childishness is merely a ruse for her aggressive outbursts. Papi may be dumb but nobody can beat her motherly instincts. As for Lorelei, she might exude an air of royalty but her extramarital fantasies are unladylike to say the least. These dichotomies demonstrate that the women consist of more than singular traits, their individual dualities playing off one another to bolster both their persons and the grander motifs.<br />
<br />
However the women represent more than dichotomies; the peculiarity is a bit more complex. It is easy to surmise that each woman represents some sort of sexual fetish. Miia has embracing, Lala has mastery of head (so to speak), Centorea has massive breasts, Rachnera has BDSM, Suu has licking and sucking, Papi has youth, and Lorelei has a handicap. Together, they are a diverse collection, offering “something for everyone”…which almost does not make sense. Asking a random heterosexual male if he would prefer sleeping with a voluptuous woman or a snake, nine times out of ten that man will choose the former. Monsters, by their very definition, are not meant to be mates or even lovers. They are scary, creatures that possess otherworldly, nonhuman aspects. So these women having something for everyone when they would seemingly having nothing for anyone is a stark contrast.<br />
<br />
And like any strong contrast, it reveals something important. In this instance, the peculiarity: “it is what is on the inside that matters most.” While cliché, this sentiment rings true here in Monster Musume more so than normal. The women are a lamia, Dullahan, centaur, spider, slime, harpy, and mermaid, mythical beings whose outer appearances can be difficult to stomach. But it is their courage, their passion, and their heartfelt feelings in everything they do, from trying to cure Kimihito’s sickness to protecting him from imminent doom, that make them beautiful. Looks are likewise important – their female human halves are part of the allure – however the monster girls emphasize that a relationship based on love is not one that is wholly concerned with the superficial but instead based on what lies beneath the skin and the scales, windpipe, fur, carapace, goo, feathers, and gills.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening theme for Monster Musume is delightful. It is extremely catchy, upbeat, and downright fun. The beginning is serene and slow, then immediately gives way, with up-and-down techno sounds that invite happiness just as the anime does. The various vocalists work in unison and individually, creating that harem yet singular feel. The intermittent “Woo!” that can be heard, the change in tone in the middle, and the back-and-forth lyrics add together to make a dynamic track that perfectly fits the show, a killer piece that wonderfully captures what the anime is all about.<br />
<br />
The ending theme goes metal, bringing the rock and the roll. The contrast with the OP works well, giving the piece a tougher vibe that the show does not normally exude. The hard guitar, drums, and screaming start the piece in a scary place, appropriate given the monster motif. Here as well, the vocalists switch on and off to mirror the group in question, but when the choir backs up the singular vocalist (Smith), it reaches a triumphant tone that matches the triumph that M.O.N. strives for. Ending the piece with a chant and a cool disc jockey is icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the soundtrack is not as sweet but it gets the job done, containing simple tracks that encompass everyday life. Considering the official title of the anime in English is Everyday Life with Monster Girls, such a musical direction only makes sense. Flutes fill the air during leisurely time to make the scenes more homely. Funky sound effects for the funny moments to increase the laughs. And slow, sensual tones for those equally sexy escapades to get the audience in the mood. Altogether the tracks fit their respective occasions, increasing the effectiveness of the scenes they are heard in even if they are not memorable as standalone pieces.<br />
<br />
As a side note, the sound effects are also effective, with a myriad of noises incorporated into the show. Spring lengthening, scythe wielding, and hoof clomping can be heard, as well as thread stretching, goo glopping, feather rustling, and wheel turning. These sounds correspond with a specific monster girl, subtly adding depth to their character.<br />
<br />
Voice acting is not-so-subtle and instead superb. While moaning is a common denominator, each woman provides an excellent performance for the character given. Specifically, Sora Amamiya as Miia has a precious way of speaking but she can roll the “R” when needed, with her going through a wide range of emotions and inflections throughout the season. Also, Ari Ozawa as Papi gives a killer rendition, with nobody’s cute way of speaking being able to match her cadence and therefore making Papi cuter in the process. And Yurika Kubo as Tionishia deserves a special shout-out, her squeaky voice accentuated further due to the size of the character she plays, making her less fearsome and more adorable. But to reiterate, everyone involved gave it their all, clearly elevating the strength of the anime.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Suffice it to say that I liked this one. A lot. Obviously part of it is how sexy it all ends up being. Miia wearing a nurse’s outfit, Lala using her tongue while getting groped, and Centorea’s huge bust are instances that I look back on (frequently) as successfully arousing me. But despite how provocative the anime was, it also had some amazingly endearing moments. Using the same women: Miia dreaming about her future with Darling and their child, Lala getting scared and hiding, and Centorea blushing to the max when her hand was held put the stupidest grin on my face. It is unbelievably cute to watch these and similar scenes, but I think it has more to do with these women, who society sees as weird, finding happiness that made me happy as well.<br />
<br />
I laughed so much watching this one, too, with every episode having some scenario that induced an audible chuckle. Papi is more or less a birdbrain, but her accidental sexual innuendos and her constant carefree attitude was always hilarious. Suu likewise, since she refused to stop smiling no matter what happened to be going on around her. Smith also had her moments, usually when she acted nonchalant with her job and her duties, which, coincidentally enough, was all of the time. The only segment that is a blemish on the anime is Papi’s egg laying bit. Not that the topic was gross but that it placed too much attention on the director dude, changing the focus from the “ecchi,” comedy, and monster girls and onto this perverted guy. Despite being a lead-in to Rachnera, it felt too out of place considering how much it diverted from the show’s normal happenings.<br />
<br />
Thankfully it is a small segment and is quickly forgotten amidst the anime’s other events. Miia pressing her face up against a window and growling angrily, Lala quaking in her boots and the chair following suit, Centorea nearly feinting while pretending to check Darling’s temperature, Rachnera tying up a lesser devil, Suu trying to rehydrate herself, Papi dropping her phone down her shirt, and Lorelei getting fired up for immoral love were all moments where I could not help but laugh or smile. Alongside the countless times I exclaimed “Hot damn!” or shook my head saying “This show…,” it was easily a fun ride from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Monster Musume is undoubtedly a strange show. Its combination of monsters and sex seems like a huge turnoff when given a precursory glance, but the high amount of execution in its “ecchi” and comedic elements is rather impressive. Furthermore, the characters are meaningful, the artistic direction is intelligent, and the voice acting is divine. Overall, the anime champions the notion that while women are certainly beautiful, monsters are, too.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Good, “ecchi” and comedy are its forte, using the monster motif to its advantage with it never deviating from its established norm in order to strengthen said “ecchi” and comedy<br />
<br />
Animation: Great, lighting and camera work are well done, the minimal censorship is a boon, the character designs are very nice, and the actual animation is always above average<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters, highlighting the monster girls well, which in turn demonstrates their dichotomies and fetishes, as well as the simple message of “it is what is on the inside that matters most”<br />
<br />
Sound: Good, great OP, good ED, fitting OST, nice sound effects, and above average VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good, sexy, hilarious, and endearing for nearly the entirety of the season<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    Wanted to write this review because my Tuesdays won&#039;t be the same anymore :&#039;(.<br />
This summer had awesome Tuesdays every week because of this show (and Overlord too ).Monster Musume is a show about an almost immortal human male that lives with monster girls,and they just keep coming(pun intended).The show was heavily discussed each week on reddit threads and lots of waifu wars have been held at that time.I cant continue the review until i tell you my top 3 girls.They are <br />
1.Rachnera<br />
2.Papi<br />
3.Smith <br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s review this show finally.We can start with the story first.<br />
Story:5/10<br />
<br />
In the first season there is kinda almost no story,basically new monster

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203725">
        girls keep showing up at the mc&#039;s house and start living there.It&#039;s kind of a Big Brother show but with just one male and bunch of hot monster girls.We get to see what they do in their free time,since the mc is the only one working but we  never get to see where.<br />
Without much spoilers,the mc gets to date each of the monster girls and each date is hilarious in a way and we get to know more of the mc and the monster girl herself.<br />
That prety much sums up the concept of the show.<br />
<br />
Art:8/10<br />
The art and animation is pretty solid through the show.Especially the last episode had some great animation,props to the studio for the great job.<br />
A lot of people on reddit disliked the heavy censoring but to be honest,it didn&#039;t bother me at all.I could really see it being good without all the lewd scenes since those things weren&#039;t the factor that made this show likable.Without any fan service this show was really funny and the censoring is totally okay with me.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Voice actors were awesome and did really well the portraying of the characters.I liked Miia&#039;s and Centorea&#039;s voices most.The bgm wasn&#039;t noticeable much but the opening was really good,probably one of the better ones from the season.Also each character has their soundtrack on the bluray release IIRC and I listened to them and they are really really good.Check out Centoreas soundtrack if you&#039;re into power metal,it&#039;s really good.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
Some fair character development through the show but the development doesn&#039;t really matter much,it&#039;s the humor those characters provide each episode.I gotta say all of them are really funny and that&#039;s what matters most.If you&#039;re into waifu debates check monster musume threads on reddit.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10/10<br />
As I said before,this show made my Tuesdays enjoyable.Twenty minutes of laughter,funny scenes and discovering new fetishes every week.What more can I ask from a show ?Don&#039;t we all need a monster girl in our lives?Monster Musume is a must watch if you like ecchi/harem shows with lots of comedy.And remember Rachera Arachnera  is the best girl!<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Thanks for reading. ^_^v<br />

    Somehow I expected Monster Musume to be some average comedy where the guy tries to live his usual life but instead is caught up in some monster girl&#039;s shenanigans every day. What I actually ended up watching, however, was offensive to even the unpromising premise of this show.<br />
<br />
The reason I didn&#039;t rate this show with 1 is the core theme it touches very lightly: The acceptance of things we perceive as different. It&#039;s already teased in episode 1 (but turned to laughs immediately after). In a world where monster-girl hybrids are an everyday occurence, people react with contempt and try to avoid them. What has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295180">
        caused a negative experience for some girls like Rachnera (and influenced their way of living) is the main message this show tries to get across (and ultimately fails, but I give points for trying): Not to judge people by their looks. The main character does exactly this and behaves indifferently to humans as well as the monster girls, showing that looks and heritage don&#039;t matter. <br />
<br />
But, in a show called &quot;Daily Life with Monster Girl&quot; you would expect the main character Kurusu to have some kind of &quot;life&quot;. As it turns out he doesn&#039;t. He is at best shown buying groceries or cooking. Apparently he doesn&#039;t have a job or hobbies or friends either. And he doesn&#039;t have any personality traits besides being nice - which is, of course, the biggest asset any harem protagonist can have as it makes tons of girls fall in love with you.<br />
<br />
Things aren&#039;t much different for the girls. They don&#039;t have anything going for them besides obviously wanting to fuck Kurusu. Their sole purpose is reminding us how nice Kurusu is and how much they depend on him and love him. I could describe every girl with a single word: Miia is jealous, Centorea is uptight, Papi is retarded, Mero is caring ... The one girl that actually has some background and personality would be Rachnera, however that amount is kept to a minimum as to not distract the viewer from the main point of this show.<br />
<br />
The main selling point of this show would be ecchi. However, the fanservice in this show is highly unsatisfying. The biggest problem is the girl&#039;s over-the-top character designs: Their human female body parts are way too exaggerated. Every girl except Papi has huge or gigantic breasts to the point that they mostly look unhealthy and entirely unaesthetic. This is not how I would want my girlfriend to look like. Fanservice is also way too straightforward: If breasts or asses are shown then they are immediately stripped naked. There is no teasing - breasts and asses are directly zoomed on by camera the moment they are there. And it&#039;s like that in every episode multiple times. After about 3 episodes it became painful to watch this show as I didn&#039;t see any merit in watching Kurusu get smothered by some monster girl&#039;s overly large breasts again and again.<br />
<br />
The comedy in this show is extremely repetitive and mostly focuses on ecchi. Either Kurusu trips and lands or some girl&#039;s breasts or Miia gets jealous and presses his head against her breasts. It&#039;s like that every time: Some monster girl gets close to Kurusu -&gt; the others get jealous and then we get to see some breasts or asses. What the fuck?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure what the purpose of Monster Musume is. It&#039;s just some wish fulfillment for anyone who has a fetish for monster girls. But as far as the sexual content in this show goes, I would advise anyone to just go watch some monster hentai instead (there are tons out there - that genre is quite popular).

    This anime was recommended to me by a friend and I still don&#039;t know why. <br />
<br />
Despite having watched (and enjoyed) ecchi/harem anime before (e.g. Rosario + Vampire), I did not enjoy watching this show in the least. <br />
<br />
Although there are many different characters, they all have little to no personality, background, or development. <br />
<br />
In the case of the protagonist - he&#039;s just there to be fawned over by the many girls. In the case of the girls - they&#039;re just there to fawn over the protagonist and serve as allusions for sexual fetishes. That&#039;s literally it. <br />
<br />
As such, the characters are unsurprisingly one-dimensional and offer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217012">
        no more than your usual anime stereotypes (e.g. tsundere, yandere, loli, etc.). The perverted moments serve neither to excite  nor to entertain and their attempts to make this anime work always fall flat. <br />
<br />
As if that wasn&#039;t enough, the plot is practically nonexistent (even for a harem), for every episode essentially consists of a new character being introduced (you guessed it, it&#039;s a &quot;monster&quot; girl!) and said character immediately joining the harem in order to add new quirks and fetishes to it (also, to fawn over the MC. Have I mentioned that before?) <br />
<br />
Besides being unfulfilling in the ecchi department, it&#039;s also rather unfulfilling in the anime department as a whole given the fact that a plot never appears and what little story there is never goes anywhere. As with any harem, don&#039;t expect any one girl to be picked (and, in this case, don&#039;t expect any questions to be answered either). <br />
<br />
Overall, I found this anime to be a waste of time and would only recommend it to someone who&#039;s really run out of ideas for productive things to do.

    Ahahaha, ever since reading the manga I&#039;ve been interested in the anime.<br />
I can say I enjoyed watching this series, although most of the time it had a lot of boob scenes...<br />
<br />
Short Summary:<br />
Just as the title indicates; It&#039;s about a daily life with monster girls.<br />
The world learned that monsters are not merely fiction but they actually exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cultural Exchange Between Species Act&quot;<br />
<br />
As it is stated, this act was created for the creatures to learn new things about humans; vice versa for the humans.<br />
<br />
But the problem starts from here.<br />
Kurusu Kimihito, a human is a &quot;volunteer&quot; in the exchange program. His world is turned upside down because of this.<br />
A

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200477">
        lamia (snake-like) named Miia comes to live with him and it&#039;s his job to take care of her and make sure she is gaining something from the program.<br />
However, there is a few laws in the program and one of them includes a law against interspecies breeding which is very strict.<br />
The problem that lies in this is that Miia is a beauty.<br />
But it doesn&#039;t stop there, later on a centaur girl and a harpy move in.<br />
Can Kurusu survive the program?<br />
<br />
So where to start....<br />
If you like harems this is the anime series for you cause it continues to increase.<br />
<br />
The story is a &quot;simple&quot; slice of life anime. Now when I saw simple I mean in the sense of living with monster girls.<br />
<br />
None the less the show was fun to watch and I recommend that if you want to continue with the series you read the manga~

    When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn&#039;t have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don&#039;t think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.<br />
<br />
Monster Musume is, honestly, total trash. In reality it deserves, even on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205782">
        my scale, a 4/10. However, for some reason, I was compelled to give it a pretty decent score. Why? Because this is some of the most fun I ave had with an anime in several months. I can&#039;t quite explain it, but this show has a lot of charm, and it was just incredibly entertaining.<br />
<br />
Story(4/10)<br />
This rating should come as no surprise to anyone.  mean, it is a harem comedy anime. Though, unlike other harems, this one doesn&#039;t do that thing where it all adds up to something serious in the end. It almost does, but not quite. o it loses a point or two for that. I really can&#039;t rate the story any lower, because that would be suggesting I expected more from it, and like I said, it is a harem.<br />
<br />
Art(8/10)<br />
The art here is just above the usual for me. I think it had just a bit more color and just a bit more style than many of the anime that have come out in the past two years, and most of those get a 7 in my book.<br />
<br />
Sound(6/10)<br />
This is my typical score for anime that have a soundtrack that wasn&#039;t noticeably poor, but wasn&#039;t really special. I can&#039;t really remember any of the songs from the anime, but the music never ruined any moments or put me out of the mood. The into is pretty great, though, so cheery.<br />
<br />
Character(8/10)<br />
Now I know what you&#039;re thinking &#039;Reeze, harems have awful character development and have little to no focus on creating a fleshed out character other than fleshed out chests!&#039; You are totally correct. However, coming into this knowing it was a harem, I wasn&#039;t looking for good development, but just characters that I enjoyed on screen. Monster Musume did a really good job of making a full cast of characters I enjoyed. To me, that&#039;s all I want from a harem, and they executed that really well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9/10)<br />
As I stated before, this is the jewel of the show. I believe I finished it in just two days, which is a lot faster than my usual 4-episodes-per-day pace. All I can really say here is that the anime was really funny, with all the same stupid jokes that every other harem ever has that I still laugh at like a complete moron. So the show has its charms, and that&#039;s all I have to say about that.<br />
<br />
I really don&#039;t think this was a great or even good anime. However, I found it to be very entertaining, and that is success in my eyes. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, is entertained my harems no matter how repetitive they are, or someone who likes so much ecchi their pants can hardly contain it. I don&#039;t recommend this to, obviously, people who don&#039;t like ecchi, harems, or stupid comedy. I will also add this is not a show you watch for action sequences.

    Monster Musume No Iru Nichijou, the most ecchi harem anime I ever watched. (To Love Ru comes in second for me lol). So this anime is just more like a perverted harem anime that makes so many &quot;sexual jokes&quot;..<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t like ecchi stuff then don&#039;t read this post cause you may not like it. This anime, I know, its a harem anime, but more ecchi kind.<br />
<br />
What makes me to give high ratings for this anime is because of the comedy and the romance in it. Because I love watching comedy romance animes. The comedy in it really made me freeze and I laughed out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203611">
        loud.. Sometimes I disturbed other people lol.<br />
<br />
The characters.. So kawaii (except for Rachnera the spider-woman).. The characters look amazing, the face, the body, and other stuff are awesome.<br />
<br />
The art, or I consider it animations, they do look amazing too.. The animations don&#039;t suck like how I saw on other &quot;anime&quot; made by non-japanese people. The movements of the body, especially Miia the snake, the snake body, I mean, it really does look like a real snake, and the spider and the other animals look perfect too. But one thing is, Papi&#039;s(the harpy) wings will sometimes fold together so suddenly, at first she&#039;d spread her wings wide open, then when she touched the ground, I felt like the staff didn&#039;t animate that part..<br />
<br />
The enjoyment, I gave it a high rating is because, yeah, the comedy, and a bit of ecchiness. I really enjoyed watching this anime because of the jokes they made, some of the jokes I seen before on other ecchi romance animes like this did appear in this anime.<br />
<br />
Now, last of all, the overall points, I&#039;d give it a 8 points is because it&#039;s really enjoyable, if you like ecchi or the comedy in the anime itself.<br />
<br />
So the pros and cons:<br />
Pros:<br />
- Kawaii characters that I can&#039;t even draw them so well<br />
- Funny jokes, some times sexual jokes<br />
- Great story<br />
- Art is amazing<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Sometimes I don&#039;t really understand the story in an episode<br />
<br />
Now, there&#039;s one more thing I wanna say, why does every episode starts with &quot;Everyday Life With&quot; and then an certain character. That&#039;s the weird part about the anime lol..<br />
<br />

Mooonster, Mooonster,mo,mo,mo,mo,mooonster.........AWWWWWW Enough of the harem! <br />
<br />
Ok, so what we have is another one of those harem based anime where as usual the genre &quot;HAREM&quot; is written allover it, so for the story (up), I gave it a 3 cu&#039;z  basically the plot was just too simple were it simply depends as to whom Darling-kun is with, cu&#039;z the plot depends so much as to whom Darling-kun is with, cu&#039;z each harem member is a plot on it&#039;s own, so for the lack of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199292">
        general plot original creator OKAYADO (whoever is he/she) turns to simply just adding a harem member after another by creating certain scenarios for Darling-kun and as usual Darling-kun is put in a situation where everyday living with his harem is an accident waiting to happen which IMO this category should get it&#039;s score. Art(up) so what did original creator OKAYADO and illustrator Takaya Sunagawa did was a menagerie of half human, half freaks, with some all freaks added, where even though they do have the boobs and the body, but, their freakish design dampens my lust and even makes me wanna puke, frankly I can&#039;t imagine how  Darling-kun could bang those freaks even if he could....and if he could, that&#039;ll would make for a very disgusting hentai , so much so that I&#039;ll put a bounty on anybody who could murder the original creator (I&#039;m only kidding), the only way that keeps me from giving this category a 1 is Smith whom I wish would be the one whom Darling-kun would bang (who am I kidding), in fact I like one part where she sports a black crop tank top and white panty.. too bad her fanservice ends there. Sound (up), well , the score is for the opening theme where it matches well with the anime and the voices of the harem member where their tone truly matches their personality, character (up) well, since I did mentioned that this anime is the usual harembased thingy, there is basically no need for me to specify each of the harem member except that there is the lack of the quintessential tsundere , now I can&#039;t say if Lala would qualify as one, since I haven&#039;t reach the part of the manga where she is in it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (up), despite of the character design that makes me wanna puke, and the usual harem comedy, on the brighter note I still enjoy watching this thing, but only barely, since this is one anime where I&#039;d be glad that it ends in a harem ending since I can&#039;t bare seeing Darling-kun getting on with any of them freaks....well except for Smith, overall (up) ok not because I barely enjoy watching this anime I&#039;m gonna give it the same score, well putas, I&#039;m not and lo siento to everyone, I&#039;m giving this a flat one, since I really find it hard to accept such anime where the character has a menagerie of freaks in his house that makes me wanna puke just imagining how Darling-kun is gonna bang each of his harem member if he can, also it just another harem anime and that&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
PEACE ESSES  <br />
<br />
BTW: Season 2.....well there are no news coming from ANN about a possible season 2 and it better be that way.  <br />
