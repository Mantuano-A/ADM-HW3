    This anime was a beautiful anime that I eagerly awaited each week. The art was wonderful with stunning colors and beautiful designs, and the voice acting was very good. I loved the character development and the costumes for each character. This anime is very much a reverse harem, if you don&#039;t like those, then maybe you shouldn&#039;t watch this anime, but you might be astounded by the interesting storyline. I believe this anime is based off an otome type game, and while I haven&#039;t played the game, I quite like the anime. This anime has a kind and caring main character who try&#039;s her best

        to be helpful and make the best of the situation. The main character is surrounded by gods from different cultures who each bring a different persona to the mix. This anime was very fun and made me laugh. I ecspecially loved the little shorts at the end of each episode.

    I am a big fan of well executed reverse harems, and I can certainly add this anime to the list of good ones. So here goes!<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
This anime had every element I would expect from a good reverse harem. It begins by introducing the situation (a bunch of gods and one human chick forced to attend a school where they must learn about the human heart before they are allowed to leave and go back to their own worlds) and then begins working on developing each character little by little. At first, the episodes are pretty much what you&#039;d expect from a reverse harem: each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149305">
        seems to focus one one specific dude and a certain problem that the heroine assists them in solving, with a couple of episodes thrown in that feature the group as a whole overcoming a problem together.   This is done very well- there&#039;s plenty of humor and drama thrown in there. Near the end of the show, a main plot begins to surface that builds up to the show&#039;s climax, but the earlier episodes give plenty of time for the relationships between characters to develop.<br />
<br />
However, what really surprised me about was the lack of... romance. Yes, there is a little bit. But romance is certainly NOT the main idea of this show.  I was expecting the more general reverse harem trend, where the heroine &#039;dates&#039; or has strong romantic connections with one or more of the characters, but in this show, while there are certainly hints of romance and flirting, there is little focus on romantic love. The relationships that the heroine develops with the gods are very friendly but close- sort of like how a sister would love her brother. There is a very strong focus on friendship in this show. In short, Kamigami no Asobi tis more about a girl who helps a bunch of incredibly hot gods with their complicated bromances than with a girl who falls in love with a bunch of hot guys- which is refreshing, but at the same time, a bit disappointing. I was hoping that Yui would end up with a guy the whole time, but nothing really happens, which is why I didn&#039;t rate the show a 9.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The characters were all beautiful. The heroine was pretty (I&#039;m not entirely sure why she needed purple hair if she was supposed to be a normal human, but what am I expecting, this is anime) and the guys were all attractive. The attractive characters were attractive, and they were designed in ways that perfectly matched their attitudes. The hair and eyes were all great.<br />
The setting was also gorgeous and well done. Crisp architecture and nature, no complaints here.  <br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
I didn&#039;t really like the OP, but I guess it fit the show. I though the closing song was much catchier and upbeat, but I have questionable taste in music.<br />
The soundtrack for this anime was pretty normal. I guess the fact that I didn&#039;t notice anything meant that it fit well, but I also didn&#039;t particularly like the sound, so I&#039;m giving it a 6. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Recent reverse harems have been plagued by the same problem: a &#039;heroine&#039; who is nothing but an empty passive shell. Fortunately, the leading lady in Kamigami no Asobi is anything but. She is kind and compassionate, has actual emotions, and is capable of making meaningful connections with all of the guys she&#039;s surrounded with. Given the near impossible task of getting a group of guys (god guys, no less) to understand the human heart, she actually cares for all of them and builds friendships with them.<br />
<br />
The gods in the show certainly fulfill the &#039;hot guy&#039; aspect that reverse harems all have, and while they are all very well written, a few of their personalities are a bit stale, and frankly, I&#039;ve seem then before.<br />
<br />
The &#039;perfect&#039; guy who is incredibly friendly and kind to the heroine but has a past that he can&#039;t get over? Check.<br />
The rebel who is a total jerk to the heroine at first but turns out to be misunderstood? Check. <br />
The guy plagued by misery who wants to keep others away so he won&#039;t hurt them? Check. <br />
The very analytical guy who doesn&#039;t understand emotion and treats everything as a mission? Check. <br />
<br />
While these are a bit overused, I can&#039;t say I disliked any of the characters.  They all fulfilled their purposes as intended. However, my favorite character in the entire show was actually sort of a side character- the gods&#039; teacher, Thoth. I found his habits of cornering Yui and yelling at her, the insulting but hilarious nicknames he gave all of his students, and the generally vindictive, sarcastic attitude he has really funny. He was probably the most unique character and in the show, and he&#039;s the reason character didn&#039;t get a 7 instead of an 8.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
It was a good show. I liked it a lot. The only thing I wanted that I didn&#039;t get was romance.  But I did get a lot of bromance, so I guess that makes up for it!<br />
<br />

    From the perspective of someone who watched both seasons of Uta no Prince-sama, Kamigami no Asobi is a solid 6. It&#039;s by no means a spectacular show, but it does its job decently well in 12 episodes and makes for an entertaining, if not particularly fascinating, experience.<br />
<br />
The concept is a unique one: Kusanagi Yui, a pretty normal Japanese girl, is summoned to a strange school to help teach young gods how to care about humans. In the first episode alone, she encounters many of her new classmates, as well as Zeus himself, the commanding king of the gods who created the very school out of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156117">
        thin air and can restrict the other gods&#039; powers.<br />
<br />
As the show continues, it becomes slightly obsessed with &quot;normal&quot; concepts, as Yui attempts to essentially teach the gods how to be human; this either works or doesn&#039;t, depending on the episode. Sometimes it can be very entertaining to see how the gods deal with the new ideas, with some of them enjoying themselves and others remaining totally confused. However, this also serves to erase any urgency that might&#039;ve been created by the fact that Yui and the gods have only one semester&#039;s time to spend at the school. We know that they will be stuck there forever if the gods don&#039;t learn to care about humans in time, but there isn&#039;t any real worry about that goal being unreachable.<br />
<br />
Around halfway through its run, the show&#039;s main storyline begins to kick in, with deeper secrets revealed about certain gods, all of which serve to lead up to the climax. This is where I personally became more disillusioned with the show as a whole, mainly because of its pacing and how the story was ultimately treated. Its largest issue is that it relies on emotional investment - it doesn&#039;t really have any impact if you&#039;re not invested in the characters, and although I was enjoying the show up to that point, I didn&#039;t really feel attached to anyone except my personal favorite god, so it was difficult for me to care about most of the story. This problem mainly lies in the fact that each god&#039;s backstory was featured in only one episode, and because most of these episodes were also padded by everyday &quot;shenanigans&quot;, the backstories are rather simple and poorly fleshed out.<br />
<br />
The characters are nice enough. None of them made an impact on me enough to be added to my favorites list, but I did enjoy watching some of them. Others annoyed me, whether it was due to (in my opinion) too much screen time or unappealing personalities.<br />
<br />
A short rundown:<br />
<br />
Apollo is arguably the most featured out of the gods. I didn&#039;t care for him, as his usual attitude is very bubbly and he tends to dominate any scene he&#039;s in; I also found his backstory one of the weakest, especially considering the mythology upon which it was based.<br />
<br />
Hades, god of death, was my personal favorite. While he wasn&#039;t anything groundbreaking and only got one real focus episode, he was also one of the most entertaining characters due to his reactions to various situations.<br />
<br />
Takeru was a Japanese god, and I frankly can&#039;t recall much about him. Neither he nor his quieter brother Tsukito impressed me particularly much.<br />
<br />
Balder is possibly one of my least favorite characters in the show. I initially liked him, but suffice it to say that he plays a large part in the darker plot and ultimate climax, and that he&#039;s cast in a light that I found pretty out-of-character and frustrating. We are naturally supposed to sympathize with him to a point, but I found much of his eventual behavior to be either unsympathetic or just plain insulting.<br />
<br />
Loki, trickster and friend of Balder, was conversely a pretty decent guy. He, too, is focused on more and more as the show draws to its close, and although I found his character to be around as shallowly developed as the rest, Hosoya Yoshimasa delivered an outstanding emotional performance that served to make me like Loki that much more.<br />
<br />
Thor, Dionysus, Thoth, and Anubis are all more minor gods who also appear in various episodes. Due to their receiving less screen time, there isn&#039;t much to say about them, aside from Thoth being quite entertaining with his habit of slamming both hands against a wall / onto a desk / etc. in every appearance. Zeus himself does appear past the first episode, but isn&#039;t featured as much as I&#039;d have liked him to be.<br />
<br />
Finally, there&#039;s Kusanagi Yui herself; while more detailed than Uta no Prince-sama&#039;s Haruka, she&#039;s not an optimal main character in my eyes. She begins the show with a very decided backbone and strong opinions, standing up to Zeus himself and trying to deal with her new surroundings. However, as the show goes on, she just lets the gods and their personalities take over. We never really get to a point where she speaks up for herself and tells arguing or upset gods to shut up or calm down; she just continually makes weak protests or looks wide-eyed and worried. There are some points where I expected her to logically react more strongly, but she remained easygoing and passive. It&#039;s not a huge problem most of the time, but it did become frustrating for me as time went by.<br />
<br />
The art of this show is basically easy to look at. Hair shading is an interesting, rather watercolor-esque style, while the character designs are pretty appealing and backgrounds are prettily done. There&#039;s nothing groundbreaking about much of it, but it is very pleasant. OP animation didn&#039;t appeal to me as much as ED, mainly because of a grittier and darker feel in the latter.<br />
<br />
The musical score is relaxing and pleasant, with some nice flutes and strings used - not memorable per se, but then again it&#039;s been some time since I saw the last episode. I didn&#039;t care for the OP although it was catchy, but the ED stuck in my head after each listen and I personally found it a very cool song.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you&#039;re looking for something light and fun, Kamigami no Asobi isn&#039;t a bad choice. It&#039;s not a masterpiece and has its few problems, but I also found it easy to watch and to comment on each episode. For me, it&#039;s just a cute, rather fluffy anime with characters that won&#039;t irritate you too much and a unique story.

    You have to watch this anime! Through character development is not one of its strong point, it sound and animation is! I love its parts, and as you know from its cover, it is full of hot guys who I wish were real! I love the ending but won&#039;t elaborate any further. It disappointed though that everything was rushed, but I love to see a second season. Similar to some reverse harems, this anime has nose bleeds moments and melodrama, but it is good anime to watch or waste time on. Like a bowl of pho after a hangover, in anime terms a perfect anime

    I went into this anime only knowing two things, reverse harem and gods. I love anime with gods and mythology, expectantly Greek mythology. Kamigami no Asobi didn&#039;t let me down.<br />
<br />
Story~ The plot was pretty simple; eight gods and a human are trapped in an academy by Zeus and can&#039;t leave until they learn about human love and emotion. Then it had episodes about each god with Yui and a few group episodes. I think the two ending episodes were kind of forced, and unneeded.<br />
<br />
Art~ This show was filled with vivid colors and visuals. Every character seemed to pop out of the screen. The opening and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184839">
        end song art really captured the feeling of the anime. The ending itself was nice. Showing each god singing as the other &#039;students&#039; rushed by.<br />
<br />
Sound~ The music wasn&#039;t very memorable. The opening was upbeat and gave the show even more cheeriness.  Neither the opening nor the ending was very intriguing to me. The voice actors really had fun with their part I could tell. Each voice perfectly matched the character&#039;s attitude. <br />
<br />
Characters~ The characters is were I had a bit of problem. With eight gods and one girl, it felt like it could be a good reversed harem. Didn&#039;t seem like too many or too little, yet they throw out two characters. Thor and Dionysus seemed to just be cut out. With Dee-Dee&#039;s love for wine and happy attitude, I think it would have been nice for him to see Yui as a love interest. It would have been great to have episode when his even drunk. Thor could have been the &#039;strong and silent&#039; type. They just had so much potential that was wasted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment~ I really did love this show. It made me laugh a lot, episode 10 was my favorite. I just didn&#039;t like the ending episode and the wasted potential.

    At last, this anime has finished airing (although I am pretty sure specials will be on their way). I will not include any spoilers, just cause not even the barely-decent stuff is worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Ever since this anime was green-lit, I was really excited to watch it. The original game comes from Broccoli, who also made Uta no Prince--and I loved the anime for that game, albeit the second season got pretty ridiculous. I love otome games in general, so I was psyched to watch another anime based on a game. But now that the anime is over, I feel extremely disappointed and that I&#039;ve wasted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148013">
        12 weeks watching this.<br />
<br />
Story: Now, the story seems decent. However, since this is a reverse harem show, obviously the anime will have little stories in it dedicated to individual gods and their respective relationship development with Yui. These stories are quite boring, and sometimes goes past the point of ridiculousness in a bad way. <br />
<br />
Art: Possibly the only topic I can give higher than a 4 on. It&#039;s pretty, although not so pretty that I can constantly admire.<br />
<br />
Sound: Not memorable. Not even the opening and ending songs are good. <br />
<br />
Character: Oh God, these characters are terrible. All the gods are pigeonholed so much that I was always extremely annoyed with them. Example: Dionysus, who ONLY talks and thinks wine. Yes, I know he is the Greek god of wine, but a good character should develop or at least not repeat the same crap every. single. episode. Dionysus was also just a background character, and so nobody bothered with him--which I annoyed me so much, because I wanted a reason why this character is there if the studio bothered to draw and animate him. All other gods do this to some degree, and never really develop--even with what happens at the end. Yui is pretty much the only decent character there, because she discovers what these gods are going through and is not a--relatively speaking--wooden character that is bland and boring. But the flaws of all the other characters overshadow her, not letting her stand out.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: With poor characters, fair art, and terrible stories, I felt like I was trudging through quicksand when I decided to continue with this anime, since I wanted to finish what I started. Nothing exciting happens really.<br />
<br />
Overall: I tell everyone to steer clear of this anime, even those who are fans of otome games and the reverse harem genre. This show isn&#039;t even laughably bad. I am severely disappointed, and annoyed that I have wasted my time with this anime.

    I dont know if this is just my opinion, but I found it to be very boring. The plot was weak and I felt like a lot of stuff either didn&#039;t make sense or were just over the top and unrealistic. The protagonist had a very plain personality, and the other characters felt one dimensional and uninteresting. i was forcing myself to watch the anime from episode one hoping it would get better, but gave up because I found it impossible to enjoy myself. I dont really recommend this anime to anyone unless they dont mind a dead plot with hot gods as love interests.

    Well then, that was nice so another reverse harem 2014 spring anime has ended, so no more fucking around as I state my ratings for each of this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
Very Good 8:<br />
<br />
Story- At first I thought that it&#039;s gonna be one of those usual reverse harem genre, but then again it&#039;s a bit different as the plot focuses on a girls whose mission was to make them deities understand the meaning of being human and therefore ending their never-dying bickering for one another. Well, of course there were still those usual helping one another thing and the competition for the maiden&#039;s heart and a usual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148049">
        harem ending except here the harem ending was put on an acceptable level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- As usual the enjoyment part is where one would ask the question as to whom the girl is gonna choose among the deities, as I&#039;ve  mention on the above paragraph was that it has an acceptable harem ending and it was that acceptable harem ending where I give this part a &quot;Very Good&quot; score.<br />
<br />
Good 7:<br />
<br />
Art- Basically the character&#039;s school uniform and the god wardrobe maybe a bit gayish for a dude but for me I find very elegant and pretty much metrosexually  &quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound- I like both the opening and closing theme, most  of all I like the VA who did Yui&#039;s voice, so basically the score is for the opening theme, closing theme and Yui&#039;s voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fair 6:<br />
<br />
Character- Unfortunately, Yui still portrays the usual reverse harem girl who is nice but indecisive, sweet but too sweet and caring but a bit ditsy. Then again, her role as the central figure for the deities kinda serves it well, which is why this category would be &quot;Fair&quot; enough.<br />
<br />
As for the deities, here are my rants about them:<br />
<br />
Apollon Agana Belea - a perfect nice guy but a bit too immature on the side.<br />
<br />
Hades Aidoneus- pretty much a gloomy old man.<br />
<br />
Takeru Totsuka- he is probably the only cast who is in need of attitude adjustment.<br />
<br />
Tsukito Totsuka- If every I encounter someone with his personality, I&#039;d be bored to death.<br />
<br />
Balder Hringhorni - I&#039;d probably say that he is half nice guy and half predator.<br />
<br />
Loki Laevatein- He simple needs some spanking.<br />
<br />
Thor Megingjard and Dionysus Thyrsos, what can I say, they are more on the sidelines than anything else.<br />
<br />
Thoth Caduceus- pretty much the meanie in this series.<br />
<br />
Zeus Keraunos- the big man who drafted Yui into service was probably the only character that I love to hate.<br />
<br />
Anubis Ma&#039;at- who the fuck is he?<br />
<br />
Melissa- pretty much the only friend that Yui has.<br />
<br />
<br />
Great 9:<br />
<br />
Overall- I can only say that this was probably the only &quot;Great&quot; reverse harem  anime I&#039;ve ever watched. The End.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    I honestly really liked this story. It did a good job highlighting each characters attributes, while answering the question posed to the viewers. I felt like each episode was its own little tale, they fit together but they were also different. If your looking at this being a &quot;romantic&quot; anime then I would go elsewhere. It has the elements, but lacked the development which disappointed me. However, I really grew attached to the characters. They all had such different personalities and it was really fun to experience. I would totally watch this anime if your looking for a different kind of reverse harem. If your

    I&#039;m sorry in advance if this review isn&#039;t necessarily in standard format, but it&#039;s hard for me to compartmentalize like that, but this show surprised me so I thought it needed a review. <br />
Kamigami no Asobi is not quite what it seems and certainly not what the synopsis implies. I came into this show expecting a mindless otome adaptation type show with a bit of mythology thrown in. Fun, but no big deal right? I got so much more than I bargained for. This show had me literally laughing out loud every week. No matter what your sense of humor their is most likely at

        least one character who shares it. Which is a lovely segway to my next point, characters. Yes, it is a reverse harem and as such follows plenty of character tropes, BUT every character is well developed, almost every character has a backstory (usually touching), and they were all just so lovable! The characters were the shining point of this show. This, in a happy turn of events, does not exclude the heroine. I think anyone familiar with this genre realizes what a refreshing change this is. Yui speaks, thinks, cares for people, and does not seem to be compelled to be a doormat. The art and music were both fantastic but don&#039;t really need reviewing.<br />
Final warnings: 1) when it says teach them (the gods) about love and the human heart it&#039;s not what you think. This is referring to humanity, not romance 2) it is a reverse harem, don&#039;t go into this expecting it to be otherwise 3) there are feels. They caught me off guard so I had to earn you. Prepare yourself for serious feels near the end.

    When I first read the synopsis I thought, oh cool, this sounds like something interesting, and I thought of the possibilities such a concept could have. So going into the anime I was pretty excited. After watching the anime I feel as if I wasted my time, when I could have been watching a far better show. Here I&#039;ll go into my reasoning:<br />
<br />
<br />
Story(2): <br />
The show doesn&#039;t have much of a plot, it is basically the female protagonist getting to know all the characters (which makes sense because it is based on a otome game), which, for me, was pretty boring to watch. In addition, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214594">
        anime gradually leads up to a main conflict/climax, but it is unknown what this climax is until the end, when they introduce it, resolve it, and wrap up the anime in about 2 episodes. It simply felt pointless, and the entire &quot;plot&quot; was a big disappointment.  <br />
<br />
Characters(4):<br />
The characters themselves were pretty simple, though the anime did try to give some of them backgrounds, but many characters were left flat and two dimensional. This includes the protagonist, who had no backstory, and whom I found to be annoying, especially as her character seemed to react the same way to everything. <br />
<br />
Art(6): <br />
As far as the art and animation go, it wasn&#039;t the best I&#039;ve ever seen but it certainly wasn&#039;t bad. It was pretty basic, and I actually enjoyed some of the character designs. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment(4): <br />
Now I didn&#039;t really enjoy this anime and despite all that I have already said there were a select few parts of the anime I enjoyed. The first being the humor. Now this anime is, of course, not a comedy, however, there was some humor that I enjoyed (particularly episode 10).  I also enjoyed Apollon&#039;s and Thoth&#039;s nicknames for the various characters. <br />
<br />
*Sound(4): In case you were wondering about the sound of the anime, there isn&#039;t much for me to say except it was fairly bland, nothing special, but also nothing terrible.

    TL;DR: If you really need a reverse harem otome fix, sure, watch this. But you&#039;ll keep on living your life just fine if you end up skipping this one.<br />
<br />
L;DR:<br />
Being lonely, bored, and deprived, I&#039;ve been spending my time on watching shows like this: based off an otome game and extremely indulgent. At only twelve episodes, I figured I could knock the show out in a couple days and get some entertainment out of it.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t wrong, it is quite entertaining. Is it good? Um... no?<br />
<br />
The plot seems a little more equivalent to that of a pre-teen&#039;s self-insert Percy Jackson fan fiction, but if you look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346419">
        past the quite frankly ludicrous premise, it&#039;s at least solid. Sure, nothing really makes sense. Why is there a talking stuffed animal? Why are the only other students at the school &quot;spirits&quot;? Why is there only one human girl?<br />
<br />
We follow our main character as she pretty much charms a bunch of different mythological gods who conveniently possess the forms of good-looking high school boys at a magical academy where they learn... honestly, who knows what they&#039;re learning there. For anyone at all familiar with the genre, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be surprised by anything that happens in the show. It&#039;s rather predictable. <br />
<br />
The art is at least consistent, the soundtrack is just fine, and some of the characters were almost endearing. Emphasis on the almost. <br />
<br />
Do I think this is a life-changing anime? Nope. But, if you just need to kill a few hours while you play Cookie Clicker on a another browser, this might be a good choice for you.

    Incoherent rant warning read with a pinch if salt this show is not that bad i actually liked it though it might not seem so. Also spoilers, also also way to much use of the word also<br />
<br />
... disappointing. I mean there is nothing really wrong with this show and if you are just looking for a generic romcom it is perfect. Though only if you have no clue about the mythology. I have no clue about the japanese gods of most of japanese myths so i may miss some things but the greek and norse gods were so out of character. Loki was&#039;t the worst

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340613">
        at most he was slightly mean and drew on someones face. Also he is now BBF with Balder who he originally killed in the myths... Twice! Thor is a background character who was the silent and strong stereotype... THOR!!! the man who is drunk and angry and fighting 99.999999999999% of the time. Also Why for all the gods did they pick Zues to be a thoughtful god, who had no romantic interest in the protagonist. Literally everyone else in the story wants to at least kiss her but not Zeus??? the god who is willing to sleep with anything that can move I mean he turned people he wanted to sleep with into cows!! ZEUS??? Why!!!! Also whenever hades was on screen with the protagonist I thought YOU ARE MARRIED AND IT WAS ONE OF THE ONLY RESPECTS MARRIAGES IN THE WHOLE MYTHOS AND YOU ARE IN A HAREM WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU. Why was Hades in this? There are plenty of other gods that could have been better. Thanos? Practically the same only not in the mostly respected marriage. Also Apollo is horribly characterized… Most of his myths are about him trying to hook up with someone and then turning into plants. His one relationship with Cassandra should not tramaze him that much. I mean it isn’t the first time this has happened. I would think hyacinth would be more appropriate because he (for once wasn’t at fault) but to a digress he still should be a playboy who likes music. Music is not mentioned once and he is nice but more in a I am just a nice person, nice than a please sleep with me nice, though this change maybe for the better because we do not want the female protagonist to turn into a tree or jump off a cliff because Apollo wants to sleep with her. Also most of these gods shouldn&#039;t have problem loving humanity saying the sleep with humanity alllllllllll the time and then you could say that they didn&#039;t have the correct love they ment in a more platonic fashion but then why is the a harem anime where they all fall in love with a characterless girl. Also the protagonist has no personality other than being nice and likes swords. But I still watched the whole thing subbed what I normally don&#039;t do so it isn&#039;t that bad just disappointing due to all the potential lost and just getting me into a mad mythology fangirl rage. BUT  LOVE the op. It isn&#039;t special but really like the course idea for a harem anime. But the ed was weird because they used a red sting and a god apple. The red string is fine though i didn&#039;t really think it fit but still i get to disney whatever. But the golden apple unless there is a myth I do not know about is talking about Atalanta or the garden of the Hesperides neither of which are romantic in a way that a romantic show wants to show off. In Atlanta’s story she doesn&#039;t want to get married so anyone who bets her in a foot race can marry her so a guy begs the gods to help him win. So they give him golden apples that he had to drop during the race where she is magically compelled to run back and pick them up. AKA cheating with the gods to force a girl to marry you. SO WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT IN THE ED not related to the themes of the show. so why but also non important. None of these things are really important but they just got on my nerves and made me want to rant. I still really enjoyed the show.

    The first episode caught my eye with everyone&#039;s unique personality, the art style and the sound so i was very intrigued, but then as I watched further through the anime, it felt so rushed that there isn&#039;t much of a connection going on with the characters that would help each other develop further more, but I did enjoy the anime and wasn&#039;t really expecting the ending, the ending touched my kokoro since I really like the guys, especially Apollo. <br />
<br />
I hope that there is a season 2 since I really like it because of the unique personalities and even if the backstories aren&#039;t that very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231860">
        detailed that can make the viewers feel what the characters would feel, I still think that it is interesting and somehow only Apollo and Yui are the only one I can see having a deep connection.

    Kamigami no Asobi is the best Reverse Harem i ever watch. I experience sadness and happiness watching this anime.<br />
The plot of the anime was understood. It show slight fan service and non of the episode will bored you. Every episode will show a plot which can be tear jerking, humorous and makes you fan girl.<br />
 This anime  makes me portray the MC, Yui as a strong willed, hard working, persuasive and NOT a slut as i usually see in Reverse Harem MC.  Since some of the gods are hard to approach Yui work hard and even when in danger fight for what she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204559">
        wants. Unlike other reverse harem MC, Yui doesnt throw herself towards the god (The gods is freaking hot i would not be able to control myself, even more when they transform )and is a very active MC. Always outside of her room and even in another world continue to train herself. Both their op and ed songs are amazing and even more their character song,<br />
<br />
MUST WATCH ANIME. BEST REVERSE HAREM EVER.

    [STORY] - 10/10<br />
-----------<br />
The story was truly amazing. The little teaser in the beginning of the anime really put an interesting vibe into the audience, and I truly did not expect the ending either. It got me very emotional in the end, and it bothered me having to think that the ending was how it ended. Maybe there is a continuation of the anime in the manga? I don&#039;t know, but if there isn&#039;t then the producers of this anime is really making me think what happens next. I&#039;ve also heard rumors that there is a second season to the anime, and I really hope so,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291759">
        although my hopes are low because it has been more than 4 years since the release. (Ye there&#039;s probably no season 2 lol) The ending was still truly amazing though, and I won&#039;t be disappointed if it ended like how it ended.<br />
<br />
[ART] - 10/10<br />
-----------<br />
The details and the background were truly amazing. When it was nighttime, the night sky was filled with beautiful and dazzling stars, and it was just very detailed. Everything in this anime was very well made, so Ii don&#039;t have anything negative to say about the art.<br />
<br />
[SOUND] - 8/10<br />
-----------<br />
The voice actors / actresses truly did an amazing job, and they suited the characters of this anime very well. The anime also put in very beautiful and romantic music in the background in a lot of the scenes, although, I don&#039;t know what to feel about the opening and ending themes. I personally don&#039;t enjoy a lot of openings and endings of animes, so this really isn&#039;t a surprise to me. <br />
<br />
[CHARACTER] - 10/10<br />
-----------<br />
Everything about the appearances and the personalities of all the characters were very outstanding, especially the uniforms for school and when the Gods turned into their God forms. It really put a deep fantasy vibe into this story, and it was really interesting to see them transform into their true forms. <br />
<br />
[ENJOYMENT] - 9/10<br />
-----------<br />
I didn&#039;t really enjoy the beginning of this anime until around episode 3-4, although like I said earlier, the ending was truly amazing and left me in shock. I knew the ending would turn out like it did because it was kind of obvious to predict, but how they pieced the ending together just made it very sad. I do wish there is a season 2, but I won&#039;t be disappointed if it didn&#039;t, because the ending of season 1 was not bad at all. <br />
<br />
FINAL SCORE:<br />
9/10 <br />

    Story: 9<br />
The plot was very well thought out. Not once did I feel like they were trying to force stuff to happen. The plot made sense, it was interesting, complex, and easy to follow. The only thing that made it a 9, and not a 10, was the fact that there was no actual romantic relationship that emerged with the main character. That&#039;s just my own preference though, and the fact that there was no relationship actually fits the plot perfectly.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The art was amazing. The scenery was beautifully drawn, the characters each had their own unique look that made them very appealing to look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252287">
        at (especially the gods, they&#039;re hot as f#%&amp; if I do say so myself).<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
There&#039;s nothing particularly wrong with the way they sound. Everyone&#039;s voice matched them, except for Melissa. The reason I gave it a 9 is because I wish there was a dubbed. (Please don&#039;t hurt me)<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
The characters were well thought out. The each had unique personalities, as well as their own issues which made us understand them better. I would have wished to understand Thoth and Zeus more. Also, more of Anubis would have been entertaining to see.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. I would recommend it to everyone. People who like fantasy will especially like this. <br />
<br />
10/10 I would recommend this to everyone, although if you&#039;re not used to watching subbed, it might be hard for you to follow.

    Amusing and surprisingly creative, Kamigami no Asobi was far more enjoyable that I thought it was going to be. Not only is the art lovely, but all of the characters were surprisingly likable. One would think that in a show that&#039;s basically about tons of guys having the hots for the main girl, there would be one douchebag that you pray the heroine won&#039;t fall for.<br />
<br />
Not so with this. Like its brother anime Uta no Prince Sama, pretty much all of the male cast were decent guys, if not somewhat one dimensional. One character I found surprisingly lovable was the god of the Underworld himself,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199164">
        Hades.  <br />
<br />
Unlike Prince Sama, however, this anime had a more creative spin to it. I mean, it&#039;s not every day that you see mythological gods as love interests. I have to be honest, I was kind of disappointed there were no Old Ones in this. Having the Great Cthulhu sparring for the love of the main girl against gods like Thor and Apollo would have been the best thing ever.<br />
<br />
I have to be totally fair in my review, however, so I must mention the anime&#039;s flaws. As always, when dealing with shows based on dating sims, the main character is kind of bland. She&#039;s not unlikable, and she&#039;s not even that dimwitted, but there&#039;s nothing too memorable about her. Her only main feature is that she is good at sword play, but that is almost forgotten near the end and the makers of the show don&#039;t use that quality to her advantage. Instead of saving the day when the show&#039;s climax is in full swing, she just follows the others and doesn&#039;t do much. In a show where gods of mythos have to learn how surprisingly strong and admirable humans are, we don&#039;t see the heroine do much except encourage and support, and while those are good qualities, it would have been refreshing to see her be the one to actually save the day; to rescue the knight in distress, so to speak.<br />
<br />
All in all, the show is a solid 7. It&#039;s good. It won&#039;t blow you away in its story, character development, or even romance, but it&#039;s good.<br />

    Finally, an otome game adaptation that sits well with me! Kamigami no Asobi has an interesting premise-- Girl and a bunch of Gods (only dudes, no Goddess because this is a dating sim) are trapped in a magic high school. The human girl must teach the Gods about humanity and love, otherwise they&#039;ll be trapped in the school.<br />
<br />
Characters are all interesting. Of course, there are some that follow certain cliches/ has one outstanding trait about them, but for the most part, they are all fleshed out. The main character is a cut above most other otome adaptation heroines in which she does get things done,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204300">
        but her personality is rather stale in comparison to the male cast. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty okay as well. It starts off pretty much slice-of-life ish for the first half, but quickly dives into full throttle near the end. <br />
<br />
All in all, would recommend if you wanna see reverse harem.

    Well, that was a lot better than I expected! I am an avid otome player and I&#039;ve seen a few anime that have been based off the reverse harem ideas or games, and most of the time, they don&#039;t go very well (see Amnesia).<br />
<br />
However, Kamigami no Asobi manages to pull it off a lot better than most. <br />
<br />
To begin with, the story: it manages to bring together the plot in the first episode quite well. There are a few plot holes or things that weren&#039;t explained to the finest, but those are issues that can be overlooked because the series was so short to begin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267428">
        with. In addition to this, it&#039;s important to note that the series was mainly episodic. A character was chosen to be the focus and then elaborated upon for an episode or so. I&#039;ll come back to this when we talk about characters. The overarching plot was about the Gods learning to understand humanity, and the show does a pretty good job of displaying it, even if it was a pretty cheesy representation. <br />
<br />
The art was great! I enjoyed how the characters were drawn (very easily distinguishable, but at the same time, not outlandish and crazy like the characters of Amnesia), and the backgrounds were pretty as well. I loved the night sky portrayals. It&#039;s also important to note that the God forms of the main characters were very detailed and beautiful, along with their specifically cultured dorm rooms. <br />
<br />
The sound was fine. I was a big fan of any of the music, but at least all the voice actors were pretty good and none pissed me off, which is a feat, cuz I get annoyed almost too easily. <br />
<br />
Getting back to the characters-- there&#039;s nine main characters. The heroine and human, Yui, is the central focus of our harem. From Greek Mythology, we have Apollon (was it supposed to be Apollo?) who gets a pretty deep tragic past that&#039;s a variation of a true myth. He gets enough development that he&#039;s fun to watch, but his motivations aren&#039;t always clear and his dialogue and actions are pretty cheesy and bland. He reminds me a lot of Tamaki from Ouran. The, from Greece, we also have Dionysus and Hades, who get little to no screen time, and whenever they do, they&#039;re used as comic relief. Personally, I wish they got more development, but I guess they were meant to be background characters and the series was too short anyhow. On the other hand, we have our Gods from Japan, Tsukito and Takeru. Both have their own episode to themselves, so they&#039;re developed well enough, though they&#039;re shoved aside in the finale for Apollon and the Norse Gods. <br />
<br />
The Norse Gods finish off the series with a bang. Loki, Balder, and Thor were barely present in the first part of the series, but slowly began to make the scene until Loki and Balder were the main focus. Despite being close with them, Thor was ignored, and that made me a little sad because he had some real potential as a character. I enjoyed the Loki and Balder sequence (mainly cuz I ship them... a lot) so it was a pretty nice finale. I would like to say I was disappointed by Yui as a whole though. I know I shouldn&#039;t expect much from anime heroines at this point (especially in a reverse harem video game based shoujo anime) but I couldn&#039;t help myself. When she talked about swordsmanship, I got excited because I&#039;m a martial artist myself, so I hoped that her character would be kickass and get the Gods off of their high and mighty thrones, but instead, the swordsmanship was used as a plot device to lure Takeru into the group and then abolished afterwards. I wish they had given her a little more umph, because she really did stand a chance at first. I didn&#039;t find her particularly annoying, but honestly, it wouldn&#039;t have made any different if she wasn&#039;t there. <br />
<br />
As much as I liked Apollon, I also wish that Yui hadn&#039;t basically been paired up with him from the start. I liked him and Cassandra better, and I honestly think that Yui with perhaps Tsukito or Takeru might&#039;ve been alright, if she had to have a pairing, though I don&#039;t think it was needed at all. This is coming from a person who loves shipping more than anything!! I just didn&#039;t feel the chemistry between any of the characters except Loki and Balder, if I&#039;m being honest. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would, to be honest. The humor was pretty good (I have a strange sense of humor, and it definitely catered to it) and the plot interesting enough that I could follow through with watching it without getting bored. All in all, a good watch! <br />
<br />
I would recommend if: you like mythology, you enjoy reverse-harems, you like it when a ton of boys fight over a girl, you like &#039;school anime&#039; without traditional school troubles.<br />
<br />
I would NOT recommend if: you&#039;re looking for something dark or angsty, you want a lot of character development, you&#039;re not a fan of reverse-harems or love triangles, you don&#039;t like mythology or mythical Gods, anime about friendship and sunshine and rainbows bore you. <br />
<br />
Have a great day everyone! <br />
<br />
P.S. In twelve, episodes, Thoth boxed Yui into a wall 11 times. Eleven times. Only once was it even needed. Just saying.
