April 5th, 2012: An anime of pure legend comes to be. Essentially a magnum opus of not only the best company in the industry, but possibly a pinnacle of animation itself. A lovechild between &quot;Baked man gets artsy&quot; creator NisiOisiN and manga artist Shouji Saeki, Medaka Box is hands down the only anime you&#039;ll ever need to see.<br />
<br />
So you might as well stop watching anime. Here&#039;s why:<br />
<br />
Medaka Box is the perfect parody of every anime ever. It manages to do this because it is an anime, and all other anime are anime. Therefore just by existing, Medaka Box is parodying all anime ever. If you didn&#039;t think that concept was suave, wait until you get a load of the setting. It&#039;s a school. That scenario right there perfectly satirizes Neon Genesis Evangelion (which in case you didn&#039;t know also had a school setting in it). <br />
<br />
So what about the visuals? Let me start off by creating a metaphor. In the beginning, there was the alpha and omega. In 2012, there&#039;s Medaka&#039;s babycharmers. Capeesh? Let me end this section by creating another metaphor. I&#039;m so hungry I could eat a horse. By horse I mean Medaka&#039;s chestnukes.<br />
<br />
What does a Medaka Box sound like? It sounds like the opposite of a really wet fart. Unless you like that the best, because then it sounds just like that. It&#039;s hard to describe the sound of Medaka Box other than unparalleled. There is indeed an opening and ending. I thought this was a nice touch. If you like music and sound, then you may end up enjoying Medaka Box very much.<br />
<br />
How many characters can fit inside of a Medaka Box? Like more than Bleach. Oh my god there&#039;s like three new ones an episode. Are they complex human beings constantly developed by the pressure and situations constructed around them by a series of choices that affect the way they live? No. They&#039;re just character designs that sometime speak. Easily the best way to handle characters ever. Thank you, Gainax.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+Medaka&#039;s rack. Just look at it. <br />
+A lot of characters. If you like characters you can find them in this anime.<br />
+There is an opening and ending song.<br />
+Wacky random crazy zaniness<br />
+There&#039;s a second season<br />
Cons:<br />
-Medaka isn&#039;t real<br />
<br />
If you care about anime you will watch Medaka Box. If you care about what it means to live you will watch Medaka Box. There will NEVER be another anime this excellent. It is actually impossible to be this systematically perfect, but leave it to Gaianx!<br />
<br />
^------v<br />
<br />
Okay, yeah, you got me, all that was sarcasm.<br />
<br />
Medaka Box takes a high seated position on my list for being extremely unmemorable. It&#039;s up there with a select few titles for being so dramatically dull that I really wish I didn&#039;t watch it. It&#039;s generic, which isn&#039;t always bad, but it&#039;s also mediocre. A level of mediocrity that I have never seen before watching Medaka Box. There&#039;s nothing offensive or out of place in Medaka Box. Somehow when you&#039;re being dragged along by this show, you are never surprised. Anything could happen, and because of that Medaka Box fails.<br />
<br />
It fails as entertainment because there is no punch line. In its comedy genre it can&#039;t manage to pull out something truly wild because there are no rules to keep Medaka Box in check. When one character is considered so good at literally everything (I say this because she is written to be literal perfection) it is impossible to wow the audience. There&#039;s nothing a character does that isn&#039;t overshadowed by Medaka, and everything she does is just a positive extreme. If someone is fighting for a physical concept, she chastises that character and then fights for an abstraction. This can be a great technique in writing. Personifying an idea within a character is great, except Medaka does nothing with it. The talk about justice and righteousness is all just smoke to cover for the inadequate motivation the writers inability caused them to script. So yes, a bunch of crazy and unrealistic things happen in Medaka Box. Sadly, unlike some shows it does nothing with them other than present them to the viewer and move on. There are no timed gags and there are no running gags. There are no gags other than shock humor that really isn&#039;t even all that shocking. It&#039;s a comedy with no jokes.<br />
<br />
Medaka Box, primarily being a shounen, must have some unique set up right? Nope. It&#039;s a pure concept copy of The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi. Apathetic boy doesn&#039;t want to do anything with his high school life, yet an eccentric and attractive female convinces him to do otherwise. They join a club together and there they meet many bizarre people. The one slight alteration between the two productions is that where Haruhi would diverge and create subplots and backplots with it&#039;s supernatural characters, Medaka Box just wants to make a battle arc. A character will come in with a problem, and then a battle takes place (sometimes over the course of a few episodes). A villain character is always introduced, and his goals are always blatantly evil. Power Rangers has more intricate villains than Medaka Box. I&#039;d even say that the fights in Power Rangers have more suspense, despite knowing that the Red Ranger will use his super weapon or the Mega-Zord at some point to take down the boss and then everyone will go home happy. In Medaka Box, there really is no suspense. At some point, all you know, is that Medaka is going to win. Why? Because she does so every time. She&#039;s perfect.<br />
<br />
Mary Sue. The impossible insert character or object of desire. In this case, its the desire. She has everything. Power, popularity, smarts, athletic skill, and so on. It is so easy to write this character. It is so hard to like it. There is nothing unpredictable Medaka will ever do in this anime (other than occasionally surprise the viewer with revealing clothing). Her male counterpart whose name I refuse to even look up because he&#039;s that stereotypical is no better. He&#039;s simply a self-insert. The writers want you to feel like you&#039;re on the adventure, and you live through the most logical choice in the anime - the average guy. If you&#039;re a guy, you&#039;ll immediately be able to resonate with this fellow. He&#039;s average at stuff, he&#039;s kinda smart in his own ways, and sometimes he gets angry when his friends are at a disadvantage. He&#039;s competitive with another guy who is very much like him. That&#039;s as far as the characters in this anime go. There&#039;s no interaction that&#039;s worthwhile or unique. Even the sound is pathetic, with nothing but pop tracks for it&#039;s opening and ending and all instrumental upbeat tracks for its main series. It&#039;s all paint-by-numbers.<br />
<br />
You change the outfit colors, get new scenery, change the supernatural aspects, include a series of anime cliche episodes (pool etc.) and there you have it. A twelve episode series of nothing better than sleeping pills. The animation is clearly looped when present, otherwise it&#039;s stiff characters standing around talking. And there&#039;s a lot of talking. It&#039;s about whose abstractions are superior, semi-Freudian analysis&#039;, and whose most powerful attack really is more powerful. Of course everything has a jargon codename too, because having terminology is really &quot;cool&quot;. For example Medaka&#039;s Forte #4 turns her hair pink and allows her to hit with the force of a dump truck. Really, why not watch Dragon Ball instead?<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re interested in this series for its ecchi qualities, it&#039;s not even passable in that category. If you saw Medaka&#039;s cleavage and said &quot;Oh yes! Sign me UP!&quot; I recommend Queen&#039;s Blade, Seikon no Qwaser, and Manyuu Hikenchou instead. Even the fanservice is mediocre.<br />
<br />
Please don&#039;t watch this anime. There is no way I could recommend this anime to anyone. Not to boys and not to girls. Not if you&#039;re ten or if you&#039;re twenty and up. Even out of irony I couldn&#039;t watch this series again. Anime like this doesn&#039;t deserve your time. There will always be something better to watch. If you&#039;re struggling between this anime and another one, pick the other one. Thank you.

    Perhaps one of the most hyped up anime of this Spring Season. Based off the popular manga Medaka Box, the shonen manga written by Nisio Isin (author of the Monogatari series including that oh yes, infamous toothbrush scene from the who can we forget, Nisemonogatari), has officially became an anime. Now, is that a good or bad thing? Hmm..with roughly half the series airing already, let&#039;s put our heads together and find out.<br />
<br />
First of all, there seems to be a trend of strong and unusual female leads this season. Koko from Jormungand, Yuuko from Dusk Maiden of Amnesia, Rea from Sankarea, just to name a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60917">
        few. Then, we have Medaka Kurokami, the beautiful and well-endowed student council president who has in her mind, no problem showing of that voluptuous body of hers which is right now, one of the main reasons some of us may be watching the show. Beyond that, she is nearly perfect and achieves what we can see as inhuman feats. But most curiously, she wishes to help the helpless and does so by creating a suggestion box. You can probably figure out where the title of the series comes by this point. Then, we have the other characters starting with her lucky or maybe not so lucky childhood friend Zenkichi Hitoyoshi. He reluctantly joins the council for the sake of his childhood friend despite the strange put-ups he has to endure daily. (such as Medaka stripping in front of him with little care) Then, we have the other characters. The student secretary Kouki Akune who became an instant fan boy of Medaka and the blue loli Hansode Shiranui who seems to have an eating habit that surpasses the hunger levels of a saiyan. Although these characters are all appealing and makes us anime fans watch further and learn more about them, what are their backgrounds? From here and out, I definitely wants to see more of that than what they do in the council everyday. Lately, another character by the name of Mogana Kikaijima is introduced and so far, we know that she is obsessed with money. To her, it&#039;s all about the money, money, and money.<br />
<br />
Now, the art and music seems to be alright from what&#039;s seen so far. However, I do realize that Gainax is NOT putting their effort into it as much as I originally hoped. The characters are blend, not original and not cutting edge. The absurd amount of fan-service seems to also seems to be thrown into our faces every 5 minutes. To me, that shows lack of effort on their behalf. I honestly expected more.<br />
<br />
Some of the music does mix in during the scenes but let&#039;s face it, it&#039;s not worth a Grammy Award. The OP for this series is somewhat catchy especially those Medaka cameos in nearly every scene. It makes sense after all to have our starring president in it as she&#039;s also the title character. However, &quot;Happy Box&quot;? The title of this seems a bit ambiguous. That suggestion box is filled with notes that expresses concerns that I highly doubt would be something &quot;happy&quot; for the council to read.<br />
<br />
But beyond that, there are also those little stitches we pay attention in every episode such as the blue loli Hansode Shiranui eating 24/7, Medaka&#039;s random symmetrical poses with the other characters, and Kouki Akune&#039;s narcissism. Strangely enough, I found these little things to be quite amusing from time to time even though they are served as comic reliefs (or maybe not later?). I mean, after all so far, this series is mostly amusing and entertaining and not one of these deep emotional series like Clannad: Afterstory where we cry tears that will fill the Grand Canyon.<br />
<br />
However, in later episodes, Medaka Box lies the smackdown and delivers some unexpected action that some of us may have not expected. Yes, it still falls under the common cliches and fan-service but at this point, who really cares? This is one of those series where you expect the unexpected from our cast, ours truly the Student Council.<br />
<br />
This series is something to keep an eye on (especially if you&#039;re into the comedy, shounen type genre) but NOT to hype over (especially for those who&#039;ve read the manga beyond this point). It has its good but also the bad points. If you&#039;re a fan of comedy and entertainment, then this series is definitely for you. If not, then just sit back and watch this for the lulz. Later on though, you can expect Medaka lay some smackdown on those she sees as troublemakers to the academy. All in all, this is a busy series. Its first six episodes of half-stories may shun away viewers and make some hit that &quot;drop&quot; button. But if you can survive that, then you might be worth in for a little treat beyond the fan-service and cliches. If it&#039;s anything, this show does bring some entertainment especially in the middle of the week where you work your ass off at work or school. But hey, that&#039;s why we have anime like Medaka Box to kill reality.

    Oh the things this could have been. When one of my favorite manga became slated for an anime adaptation you can bet your ass I was jumping for joy, however the initial ecstasy was soon power-slammed into the ground and pissed on as time flew by. Penned by phenomenon known as Nisioisn, the Medaka Box manga started mediocre but eventually established itself as a wonderful clusterfuck combination of every genre known to man. The problem with the anime is that it didn&#039;t get past the mediocre part.<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
<br />
Gainax produced a 1:1 adaptation of Medaka Box&#039;s first arc, but this faithfulness is one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64517">
        anime&#039;s fatal flaws. By choosing to animate the series with only 13 episodes Gainax trapped the show in its slice of life phase. The problem here is that Medaka Box wasn&#039;t meant to be slice of life, it was meant to be a jumbled mess of battle, romance, fourth wall breaking, screwed up villains, and character interaction. The series pretty much focuses on the introduction of the story, and introductions aren&#039;t really that stimulating.<br />
<br />
Art - 5<br />
<br />
The inconsistency in quality is quite apparent, you can clearly tell the budget was saved to animate the last few episodes. One might mistake Medaka Box for an anime made in the early 2000&#039;s as the quality is far below the average series produced today. Rejoice though, for the budget can be found hiding in the final arc of the series! Unfortunately the first part was done so bad that I doubt many people even made it to the final arc, which is quite a shame really. In contrast to the questionable animation plaguing the opening sequences, the latter half of the series is animated quite nicely. It displays the vibrancy of Medaka, the immense power she wields, the emotion filled faces of her enemies, and all her splendor when what little sanity she has is substituted for the primal fury of a wild dog.<br />
<br />
Sound - 3<br />
<br />
There is no better way to start off a series than with a vapid J-pop song that doesn&#039;t compliment or tie into the story in any way, right? Thank god Medaka Box has one of these opening sequences to distract us from the generic ending song. All jokes aside though, the only thing memorable in Medaka Box&#039;s soundtrack is how unfitting the music is with some scenes.<br />
<br />
Characters - 8<br />
<br />
Enough with the negativity! The characters of the series are depicted as well as I could have hoped, showing each persons unique traits in a flavorful way. Akune&#039;s aura of superiority, Kikaijima&#039;s aloofness, and Medaka&#039;s overbearing superiority are fleshed out skillfully in the narrative. If you enjoy watching overpowered characters accomplishing a myriad of insane tasks then I definitely recommend this series. Characters are the driving force of Medaka Box, and while there are many who dislike overpowered characters, for those who do this anime is a special treat.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
<br />
My views may be biased as a manga reader as I know the series should have been longer and had a quicker pace but I still enjoyed the show, if only for the ending. While the slice of life portion may have drudged on and on, the battle arc at the end nearly redeemed the series. Nearly.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6<br />
<br />
Many, many things could have done better but if you enjoy school life anime with a twist of battle shounen then I would recommend you at least try Medaka Box. Even if you&#039;re only a fighting anime fan then it may be worth it to marathon this series in preparation for season two which I predict will be MUCH better. Manga readers may be disappointed with the anime, but for a first time audience of the series this show may be quite the treat. All I have done is pointed out the major flaws afflicting the series, if you can deal with these gripes then by all means try a few episodes.After all it IS written by Nisioisin, the man who brought us beautiful works of fiction such as Katanagatari and the Monogatari series.

    Obviously it&#039;s not every year that Gainax pulls out a Gurren Lagann or a Panty and Stocking, but this latest offering is fairly dull and predictable.<br />
<br />
The main problem with Medaka is that it&#039;s yet another Anime about high school, yet another Anime about some sort of school club, and the characters themselves are boring tropes of the genre. Everything about the show is so overplayed, and probably being done in any of the other 10 or so high school shows this season.<br />
<br />
Credit where it&#039;s due though, the voice work, sound design, and artwork is pretty good...even if there&#039;s a bit of OTT character designs for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59371">
        fanservice reasons.<br />
<br />
Admittedly I&#039;ve only seen two episodes, and it&#039;s not awful by any means. Just...boring

    There is an abundance of people in the world considered enigmas. Un-explainable, insane and completely out on the outer rim. Their persona ultimately comes to be accepted or completely rejected, most cases swinging either way.<br />
<br />
Medaka Box or &quot;Suggestion Box&quot; sparked my interest by means of such an enigma known as Kurokami, Medaka but ended up just being another anime I couldn&#039;t really appreciate. I can&#039;t really say anything let me find a groove of enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Being another school based setting this rather failed to bring much of anything called &quot;New&quot; to the table, its outright out done and gets boring after dozens of morbid failures. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64029">
        just keep running flaws after flaws in my head but picking a few out of a handful is hard.<br />
<br />
First off, the art style just down right turned me off. I can&#039;t really say it was done very well at all, it felt almost low budget. The level of detail in anything was non existent and the thing that annoyed me the most were the character drawings. As we all know anything anime related is hardly comparable to real world applications, especially on the character sides. What I really want to touch on are the facial features, everything is low detail, everything overlaps and it just feels like a thrown together slop job. Unless you&#039;re into fan service I assume you were staring at &quot;Jugs&quot; a majority of the time.<br />
<br />
Now I felt that Medaka&#039;s character was out of place all over the map. Going from looking like the innocent school girl to a DragonBall Z parody was just appalling. I for one want to see more of the &quot;Character of interest and power&quot; show less empathy for the students or people around them. I can&#039;t really appreciate an overpowered character try and bring out the inner goodness of people then eliminate anything or anyone threatening the peace. Its just been done too much already, and in a school setting it just feels out of place.<br />
<br />
I really put this entire series off on weekly basis because it had it lacked substance. It was slow paced and put me off. I can&#039;t really say I enjoyed it at all. Maybe one day originality will be norm.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t let me make you pass this though, if you&#039;re a fan of club based shows with a cute main lead you might give this a watch.<br />

Welcome to Hanokiwa Academy, where everything takes place. Right from the start you are told that first-year Medaka (the busty main character) is the new President of the Student Council. After she has got it established, Zenkichi (guy main character) joins her, followed by Akune. They have created a suggestion box, taking suggestions from fellow students to improve the school by solving problems, but also for personal help. I can&#039;t say it&#039;s original, but you can&#039;t judge a book by it&#039;s cover.<br />
<br />
However this anime keeps going and going in the same direction, going from the gymnasium to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60489">
        indoor pool, the same shit ALL THE TIME.<br />
You shouldn&#039;t watch this for the ecchi either, you&#039;re better off going on danbooru and searching for Medaka or something. <br />
<br />
One last thing i&#039;d like to mention is that it&#039;s tolerable that Medaka is pretty much perfect as a person, but seriously how fucking far are you going to take this? On episode 1 with the space and everything I was lost, but Medaka also has superhuman strength, discipline, she even.. solved the worlds most problematic math problem... WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN A NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL THEN? <br />
<br />
&#039;What the fuck am I watching&#039; applies to this anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 3. Poor.<br />
Art: 5. Mediocre art, not to mention weird anatomy but original to praise it a little.<br />
Sound: 5. Sounds normal?<br />
Characters: 4. Not memorable at all, except for Medaka. <br />
Enjoyment: 5. <br />
Overall: 5. I&#039;m being generous here, because maybe it will get better. But it won&#039;t ever get a rating higher than a 5, so i&#039;m set.

    Hello!!!!!!!!everybody, as we near the last episode of this 12 episode anime, it is probably very  obvious that technically this anime ended on the 11th episode and the last episode is merely a filler, so let&#039;s cut the BS and let&#039;s proceed as to how I rate this anime. First of all, we are expecting that the Gainax will follow along  with the manga, but what we have instead is a lousy combination of &quot;Sket Dance/ Ōkami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi/ Kaichou wa Maidsama with a &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; element all  squeeze into just one character, the worse part is that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63583">
        plot of this anime is loosely  focus on the character itself, so I can&#039;t help but give it a &quot;Poor&quot; number 3. Btw, I have yet to read more of this anime&#039;s manga.<br />
<br />
Art: Good 7. <br />
<br />
The rating is for the fanservice of the main character, and her resemblance to  Rias Gremory from High school DxD.<br />
<br />
Sound: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
No comment here.<br />
<br />
Character: Pathetic 1.<br />
<br />
Ok, so why such rating? Well the thing about the main character Medaka Kurokami, is that the anime&#039;s director Shouji Saeki  has project her so perfectly that I&#039;d find her irritating, it is not what she&#039;s capable of that I dislike, it is what the author  don&#039;t want to make Medaka to go through that is a deal breaker, we all know that in any show there is a unwritten rule that the protagonist always win, however there is an provision in that rule that the protagonist has to undergo some kind of seemly hopeless ordeal, in this case Medaka is somewhat of  a character who is  excepted to under go such ordeal as any protagonist will go through which to me makes her an unlikable character, in fact I kind view her a an apex bully in Hakoniwa Academy, who uses the student council as her den.<br />
<br />
There is also Medaka&#039;s childhood friend Zenkichi Hitoyoshi whom she assigns as her  Gen Affarirs Manager....more like she forces him to be one, according to available info, he&#039;s Medaks&#039;s dog so &quot;Ka Ching&quot; the role suits him, but it also says that he&#039;s good in Savate............ok, so does the author know what &quot;Savate&quot; is? Co&#039;z the way he fights is no different than what other fight scene  in any other animes with an action and martial arts genre in it, IMAO the author should have just made Zenkichi a black belt in Karate.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don&#039;t know what &quot;Savate&quot; is, it is basically a French version of Muay Thai, the differences are that in Muay Thai using the knee and elbow is legal while in Savate it is illegal, also, Savate is the only kick boxing contact sport were players wore shoes.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
To me to the enjoyable part here is my sympathy for the antagonist who failed to give Medaka a good spanking. I kinda cheer for the antagonist of this anime hoping that anyone of them would give Medaka hell, but then again I also cheered that Medaka was able to whoop the antagonist&#039;s ass instead, as much as I wanna give this part a &quot;Good&#039; rating, a &#039;fair&quot; rating will do instead, since I&#039;m  pissed at Unzen for unable to kick Medaka&#039;s ass, but I do enjoy the fanservice as well as Shiranui and Mogana Kikaijima cutsy roles.<br />
<br />
Overall: Pathetic 1.<br />
<br />
Well, if you&#039;re after the moe and the fanservice of this anime, then enjoy, for me this is one can be considered as a rare lousy anime were the author place all the eggs in one basket particularly on Medaka where she can be classified as some kind of cuisine that has too many condiments and seasonings in it that it becomes inedible. Frankly, I&#039;d advice to simply stick to the manga, and I hope that Gainax won&#039;t even think about making a season 2. <br />

    Gainax: they do great original series (Evangelion) but perhaps, never fantastic adaptations.<br />
Studio Shaft and Studio White Fox both had a splendid adaptation of Nisio Isin’s (NisiOisin) Bakemonogatari and Katanagatari respectively. Due to this, I’ve set my bars high for Medaka Box which is animated by another known-to-be-good animation studio—Gainax. I have seen quite a lot of original stories from Gainax and they’re all good. But when you talk about their adaptations, well, they’re badly narrated and fares mediocre at best. Unfortunately, Medaka Box is on the same line: run-of-the-mill (see section: Dialogue).<br />
<br />
STORY (2/5):<br />
The story follows a problem-of-the-day format and I don’t think this would change

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58237">
        in the latter episodes. I would have been better if Gainax would incorporate some original ideas into their adaptation to spice up the dull format of the story. If not, they may also follow the Monogatari series’ three-to-four episode arc format so they will have room to build up the tension. But judging from the first episode—and much to my dismay—I think they will stick to the dull problem-of-the-day format.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (3/5):<br />
Characters are so-so. The main character is a tsundere, her leading man is a delinquent and the girl-in-blue is a hyperactive moe. I have seen these personalities in other series already. Gainax should add some unique and striking personas to set Medaka Box apart from the multitude of rip-offs and wanna-be’s.<br />
On the contrary, voice acting was good but not great. They can express the characters’ emotions reasonably but they still have a lot to go to actually leave a lasting impression—maybe in the next episodes they will do so.<br />
On a side note, I am VERY DISPLEASED with this: why does Medaka very much resemble Senjougahara Hitagi that even their hair color is the same?<br />
<br />
SOUND (2/5):<br />
Classical music is good but not when it is out of place. A triumphant music to complement a casual conversation? Seriously. Why? All I could say is that the background music is usually unfit for the scenario it complements.<br />
<br />
ART (3/5):<br />
I see some imitation of SHAFT and Silver Link elements in their art.<br />
Immediately in the first five seconds of the first episode, you’d see checkered accent in the clock tower. That is an art style made famous by Silver Link’s Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu series. Gainax could imitate it but to some extent  they fail and just proves that imitators cannot simply beat the creator of the original idea.<br />
Likewise, SHAFT references are present in many scenes. You’d see how at times, characters are separated by two contrasting colors of the area they stand in—light and shadow for example. But, well, again, they can’t draw the contrast harmoniously—a feat that only the originator of the idea SHAFT can do.<br />
On a brighter side, they have a fluid smooth animation which is commendable. But that is all, nothing more.<br />
<br />
DIALOGUE (1/5):<br />
Truncating conversations in a NisiOisin novel is like cutting the lifeline of the series itself. So why Gainax? Why did you truncate the conversations? It is the most essential element of the novel, and without it, the foundation of the whole story topples down.<br />
I am severly displeased to how short their conversations are. They’re like throwing one-liner quotes at a time—and this is definitely not how it should be.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Gainax might not really be the suitable studio to animate Medaka Box. Isin’s novels always require this “bizarre air” in the adaptation to make the series shine. Gainax was too straight-forward and their style just contradict Isin’s.<br />
Eccentric anime studios like SHAFT, White Fox or Silver Link are better suited to man the helm of Medaka Box.<br />
<br />
For now, Medaka Box still reeks of bad animation. But I&#039;m still giving it a &quot;5&quot; to give it a chance to, perhaps, prove itself.

    After finishing this series, there are just a few things I&#039;d like to clear up. <br />
<br />
First of all, this series was adapted (quite faithfully, I must add) from a relatively popular shounen manga of the same name. It&#039;s not in any way complete, and a second season has just been confirmed. This first season served mainly as an introduction to the characters and setting.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if you haven&#039;t read the manga already, I suggest doing so. It&#039;s nearly exactly the same as this anime has been so far, so you won&#039;t be missing out on much if you skip over this in favor of the manga.<br />
<br />
Alright,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59911">
        on to the actual review!<br />
<br />
Medaka Box starts out as a typical school life story with supernatural/shounen elements. It&#039;s interesting to see a shounen series with the main fighting protagonist a female, although some may argue that Zenkichi is the true protagonist here.<br />
<br />
The premise of this series is about a student council with an unbeatable president, Kurokami Medaka. Right off the bat, everything about this series seems like it should be completely unlikable. We&#039;ve got a useless male lead, an overpowered big-breasted female lead, and a bunch of other seemingly annoying characters. But somehow, after just watching a few minutes of the first episode, I began to actually like them.<br />
<br />
Honestly, by itself, this anime is not very good. It just doesn&#039;t make sense unless you know what the manga will eventually be about, and that&#039;s never a good idea. My enjoyment came from the way this show made me laugh, and I really did like the characters a lot. Despite the fact that all the characters are overpowered archetypes, Medaka Box presents them in a way that is rather satirical. This show doesn&#039;t take itself seriously, which makes it very enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall, I liked Medaka Box. The pacing was strange, but the ending left room for all of the events that have yet unfolded in this anime adaptation.<br />
<br />

    Medaka Box is an anime about Medaka Kurokami, a flawless girl and her childhood friend Hitoyoshi Zenkichi, who works hard to follow her, the story follows the two and more in the joining of high school while these two make up the Student Council, but one twist the president Medaka promised to solve everyone problems by the use of the Medaka Box.<br />
<br />
Note: This review contains light spoilers.<br />
Disclaimer: This is my own opinion. They are not facts.<br />
<br />
Perfection, this subject hasn&#039;t been touched a lot in the anime franchise, this anime: Medaka Box is not a real battle shounen and the action is very one sided, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64743">
        it is neither a fail of a shounen, rather it could be called an anime which mocks these kind of anime. In a lot of shounen the good guy/girl overcomes hardships and in a life or death battle the bad guy gets transformed to the good side by seeing the light or something. Medaka doesn&#039;t have this life or death situation or the problems, well because the main character is perfect and flawless and a big physiological factor plays with this:<br />
Can we stand someone who is completely better than anyone in everything? No, obviously we can&#039;t. We are humans who have pride, so we dislike the people who do everything right while being modest about it. This is called pride in a positive way and arrogance in a negative way. <br />
<br />
The story itself consists of Medaka and Zenkichi solving problems around school, the latter episodes revolves around a fight between the Student Council and the Disciplinary Committee. I think this anime stopped at the point where it becomes somewhat more of a shounen and where the other characters actually get to do something.<br />
<br />
Art-wise it does differ a lot from recently aired anime, instead of going for a more realistic look it has a pretty shounen like look. The animation isn&#039;t anything special, nothing too be amazed over. Maybe even a bit skippy if you ask me.<br />
<br />
The opening song &quot;Happy Crazy Box&quot; fits the anime well and the ending theme is a character song by Medaka&#039;s seiyuu. Which is good, again this anything really good, it is decent and that is it all.<br />
<br />
Since I already talked a lot about the character Medaka, you might notice that I think this is the anime&#039;s strongest point and I do think that. A character doesn&#039;t always need to be likeable to be a well done. Medaka&#039;s personality and actions might be disliked by a lot of people, but they probably made it so you would not like her and that is the point. On the other Zenkichi is a real typical shounen like protagonist, hard-working self-sacrificing and surprisingly a bit of a tsundere. Akune is more of a supporting character than a main, but still contributes to the story, Kikaijima, one of the many &quot;reformed&quot; enemies is a shy girl who only has money on her mind.<br />
<br />
Overall I though this was a very unique anime, which opened some people&#039;s eyes about the term &quot;perfect&quot;.<br />
<br />
Best thing in this anime:<br />
- The various range of characters and their personalities and the view it gave me on &quot;perfect&quot;.<br />
Worst thing in this anime:<br />
- The art, animation and sound part were very lacking. The series might also have been a bit too episodic, but with only 12 episodes this probably could not have been helped.<br />
<br />
Life lesson learnt: People rather have a hard-working failure, than a talented, flawless person.

           Oddly enough, I found myself enjoying this show more than I thought I would. Far from perfect, it still has it where it counts with its witty humor and “out there” characters.<br />
<br />
       According to fans of the manga, the anime really didn’t cover a lot of ground. More or less the majority of it was introducing the characters and developing them as they interact with each other in a case by case sort of way. The last, oh let’s say, third of the series is the first story arc.<br />
<br />
   

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170091">
           This character, Medaka, is too perfect. She has a way with getting anyone to see things her way and uses this to “convert” delinquents into upstanding people. Her methods are a little less than ideal as there tends to be violence involved at some point. In the end, however, she succeeds in accomplishing her goal, one way or another. While it is for the good of things, she’s a love/hate kind of character.<br />
<br />
       The comedic value of the show overall isn’t the best. But it has its moments. The general consensus says that it may be a better option to read the manga if you’re really looking to get into this series. I cannot confirm or deny that, as I have not read the manga.<br />
<br />
      Overall I give this show 6/10 , its a Decent for what it was, but nothing award winning. Sort of became an after thought when I was finished watching it. For a slice of life style anime, with decent humor and all around fun characters, it’s good to give a shot if you’re bored and need some comedy.

    Your typical shounen hero is a saint. No doubt about it. Whether they are challenging the strongest guys in the universe on planet Namek, traveling the endless oceans on their way to become the pirate king or gathering the most exquisite ingredients to complete their full course menu, these perfect human beings will overcome any challenge by propagating the three golden principles of the Shounen Jump Magazine: friendship, effort and victory.<br />
<br />
The main question is: do you really buy it?<br />
<br />
- The Story:<br />
Although it may at first glance look like a blatant Suzumiya Haruhi rip-off, Medaka Box actually deals with the afore-mentioned question. We follow the adventures

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125425">
        of the abnormally perfect Kurokami Medaka fulfilling her duties as the student council president. Accompanied by her more than sceptical childhoodfriend Zenkichi Hitoyoshi, Medaka dashes off to help every student on campus, whether they are really in need or not. There are no boundaries for this student council president as she resocializes even the most notorious delinquents. <br />
The storytelling is more or less character-centered and engages the consumer with its many humourous moments and crazy situations. The numerous student requests lead the student council to join wacky escapades while the audience discovers layer neath layer of what can be assumed to be Kurokami Medaka&#039;s psychological profile. Is she a saint or a monster...?<br />
<br />
- The Characters:<br />
To be honest, this is probably the most striking element of Medaka Box. While the scenario, as described above, the concept of an energetic girl forcing a cynical boy to join a club against his will, is not new, the characters that fill the roles of Suzumiya Haruhi, Kyon, Koizumi etc are very well written and invite you to actually understand their competing world views as well as their fascination with the main heroine. And that fascination is not without cause.<br />
This show stands and falls with its main character. Kurokami Medaka, the saint-like student council president, knows how to get what she wants, which is most likely something for the good of everyone. She definitely is one of the toughest female main characters in a Shounen franchise that I have ever seen. Talking personally here, after seeing countless of these pseudo-strong heroines fall to being protected by their male counterparts revealing themselves to be the actual strongest in the end (talking about Saber, Shana, etc), it was completely refreshing to see a female character taking the lead role in a Shounen Jump series, actually being in charge of most of the butt-kicking action while her male partners rather support than supress her power.<br />
<br />
- The Design:<br />
Although its scenario appears as your typical highschool setting, the character design already underlines its actual focus. Most of the students are weird looking, starting by their unusual school uniform look and ending in their crazy hairstyles or extreme body shapes. Those differ from certain elementary school kid sized students to brawny muscle guys or girls like Kurokami Medaka herself being overly sexy. This style adds a more than trashy vibe to the already weird contents of the Medaka Box adventures and gives you an idea of how to really handle the show.<br />
<br />
- The Final Conclusion:<br />
Although the first season of Medaka Box only covers a small percentage of the actual Shounen Jump Manga series, it really appears to be more or less complete within itself dealing with the simple matter of constructing and introducing Kurokami Medaka&#039;s saint-like character and posing the question of whether we trust our perfect Shounen heroes or not. <br />
<br />
If you are sick of your typical pseudo-strong heroine please feel free to experience something different within this student council.<br />

    Medaka Box is one of the anime that has greatly let me down. Being a fan  of Nisio Isin, I hoped it to be a good anime. But it was nowhere near what I had hoped it to be. Please note that I didn&#039;t read the manga, so i am NOT gonna compare. Honestly the anime had a good potential, but unfortunately it ended up with more flaws then perks.<br />
<br />
The first flaw of the anime is it&#039;s story. Story without any continuity is not that uncommon. In fact, it has become quite common it recently. To barely cover the setup and then burst off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88965">
        to some random events - I like that type since it&#039;s good refreshment from deep, complex storyline. But unfortunately it didn&#039;t work quite well for Medaka Box. The short 12 episodes tried to do a lot, yet did nothing than merely gathering the characters. I do realize that this acted as a mere setting before the second season, where it will hopefully get into the real story. However, even so, it could&#039;ve tried to be not so boring.<br />
<br />
The second, and the biggest problem of this series - is it&#039;s lack of character development. Honestly, the other members of the Student Council then Medaka got around as much screen time as a decorative foot soldier of a war movie. They did almost nothing. Zenkichi spent most of his time explaining Medaka&#039;s forte. they got episode 12 for themselves, that&#039;s all. Thinking about it, they didn&#039;t do much except speaking about Medaka. So, in the end, Medaka got all the spotlight. Even if she is the protagonist, it&#039;s overdoing it.<br />
<br />
The third flaw would be its grandeur and exaggerations. Well, it&#039;s anime, so that is forgivable. But the &quot;pretentious appeal to innate goodness&quot; - well, it gets old. Things like that goes well once or twice in one anime, not one per episode.<br />
<br />
As for the good sides, the art is quite good. The grandeur becomes quite bearable, in fact, it becomes normal looking thanks to the art. And I have no complaints in the sound department either.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s not a failure of an anime, but neither is one that may be considered very good. If you&#039;re not used to exaggerating actions and somewhat pointless stories, you&#039;re better off not seeing it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and also, if you&#039;re familiar with Nisio Isin&#039;s works, then you might understand - this anime has that signature style of his. Honestly that was the only reason I ever started this anime.

    I want to start off by saying that this review is for both series of Medaka Box.  This anime had very much so it&#039;s strong points and it&#039;s weak points.  For the strong points my three favorite things in anime: the characters were amazing, Medaka and Zenkichi, I can&#039;t spell so do not get mad, there was contrast to the characters such as the overall change in how Medaka changed over the period of the series, and finally, the comedic relief was out of this world I liked that probably the most.  It definitely lacked in art because of the fact that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178195">
        if the character had long hair, their eyes would go through the hair and in my opinion was tacky and also the soundtrack was not bad, but not memorable by any means. Overall though I loved this anime and I was contemplating on giving it a nine until the last episode which got way off topic.  Definitely a great watch and I encourage anyone who would want to watch the anime, you need to watch it really great.

    I really enjoyed watching Medaka Box and I will review it for you in an easy to - read way. I seriously suggest watching it for a funny and entertaining anime!<br />
<br />
Story (no spoilers) - Medaka Box is about a nice yet bossy student council president who is OBSESSED with helping strangers when they&#039;re in need. She tries to get her childhood friend in the student council but he is totally against it. She tries to reform everybody who has done a bad deed and eventually comes up against difficult challenges. <br />
<br />
Characters - The characters throughout the show are good with some great background stories. There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173815">
        are a lot of unique fighting styles between the characters and some interesting personalities. My favourite character would have to be Unzen, Myouri because I love his fighting style and bossy - childish personality.<br />
<br />
Overall the anime is great to watch when your bored or if your into a comedy, action and school anime.

    I wish I could just say &quot;It&#039;s a series by Gainax. Enough said.&quot; Unfortunately, it is too early to make that statement for Medaka Box. The series is off to a good start but it is still unclear if the series will hit the mark that many expect out of Gainax.<br />
<br />
The series revolves around Medaka, a first year that is elected as Student Council President with a staggering 98% of the vote, and more or less forces her childhood friend, Zenkichi, into joining the Student Council as its lowest ranking member.<br />
<br />
The first thing she does is establish a suggestion box, later dubbed by students the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59007">
        &quot;Medaka Box&quot;. Medaka encourages students to submit any problem to the box without hesitation and promises to take on any issue from anyone. The Student Council members then spend their days solving the problems submitted through the Medaka Box, whether they be hooligans in clubs where they don&#039;t belong or people who&#039;ve lost their pets, gradually earning the respect and admiration of the entire school.<br />
<br />
Medaka has a very charismatic, hardworking, trustful and overwhelming personality that makes her seen as a &#039;superior human&#039; which plays a huge role in the series as various characters continually point out, but she also has some very glaring human flaws that few see. She has a very large jealous side and can also be a tease to her friends. In a way she reminds me of Haruhi Suzumiya with the alien and supernatural obsession swapped out with an obsession to help others.<br />
<br />
My favorite character at thie point, however, would have to be Shiranui. She is the comic relief character of the series. Zenkichi is apparently the only person who can get along with her and somewhat control her. Even though she is the smallest of the main characters, Shiranui has a very large appetite and is constantly seen eating. She has a knack for finding confidential information with ease, knowing about most things that would seem to be vague details, and is unusually perceptive. Normally, she is a very cheerful girl but she is shown to have a dark side and is brutally tactless.<br />
<br />
Backgrounds are well done. It&#039;s vivid and bright, reminded me of Baka to Test series. The character designs really remind me of High School DxD and the animation is very fluid and smooth.<br />
<br />
The soundtracks do a pretty good job of blending into the anime&#039;s atmosphere, and while the opening and ending were quite good they are not all that memorable.<br />
<br />
The series definitely show the elements to make a great show, but it all has yet to come together. Based on the first two episodes I would say...<br />
<br />
Score wise:<br />
Story (7/10)<br />
Art (9/10)<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
Character (9/10)<br />
Enjoyment (8/10)<br />
Overall (8/10)

    Medaka box,lets see an interesting anime or rather an annoying one! Or maybe i am jumping to conclusion!!! probably thats it.That&#039;s what i thought at first but i am telling you this that at first glance it may seem boring but i suggest that have patience because the first season is probably the most boring one! I am telling you guys this anime is far interesting as the story develops!<br />
<br />
That being said lets get back to the issue in hand! Medaka box is a school genre anime that goes as a shounen type but probably not! It centers around a girl who loves everything or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63405">
        rather i say everyone( goes far as kissing to). Her name is kurokami medaka, a popular student council president who is willing to see everyone in her own ideal! She has monstrous strength, big boobs and a habit of mimicking everyone! She has the power of transforming( i don&#039;t know how) and can change modes like war god mode etc.According to zenkichi since childhood she always butts into others problem without thinking but somehow always comes out successful.But she has a never failed to solve a problem except one that she still regrets( this will be revealed in due time in the following season). She is a good character that acts like a saint but can be devil for the sake of his close friends!<br />
<br />
akune kouki, known as the judo prince, is a handsome man popular with the girls but that is after coming to high school. Before he was a terrifying person that caused a whole gang being hospitalized! He was being reformed by nekomi his for Judo club captain.He has feelings for medaka chan and confessed to her and got rejected in a instant.He was accepted a student council secretary by medaka chan and doesn&#039;t get along with zenkichi.<br />
<br />
Kikaijima mogona is a swimming club member rather a special swimming club member! She with two others can live or kill for a single yen! she was hired my medaka chan a treasurer and wats to be friend with zenkichi and medaka chan.Her dream is to fill a pool with money and swim in it with Yakushima and Tanegashima, his two close partners! she lost her first kiss to medaka chan.<br />
<br />
shiranui hansoda is little girls in outside but somehow she knows everything and has solution to every problem. She is a member of the 13th class with medaka and unzen the disciplinary committee chairman( this will be shown in due time)! She is granddaughter of the sandbox academy! She hates the student council president, like sweets, doesn&#039;t think about rules and the one person she get along with is zenkichi but is when she likes.<br />
<br />
It may not seem like but Zenkichi Hitoyoshi is the main character of this story!You will see this maybe in the later seasons! Zenkichi is a kind of tsundere person who despises but has feeling for medaka chan at the same time! He has been known and befriends with her since age two! He was always forced to go and tag along with every medaka chan plans! He isn&#039;t kind like medaka chan at all! he can kill in order to protect her!He is also known as the guard dog of the student council, the club crushers and later he will known as more! He does everything as his president says like wearing a jacket under his shirt.He regards himself as normal but he has more power than he thinks! His power far surpasses medaka chans power but i believe is not shown in the first season.He is probably a useless main character in this season.<br />
there goes the long character details!rather than them their are many minor characters that i have no energy to describe!<br />
This anime isn&#039;t good in the beginning but has the potential to grow interesting. this anime is mainly a comedy,martial arts,echhi,romance type anime!  except martial arts i believe rest are not that well shown!<br />
To be honest i didn&#039;t enjoy it that much but still recommend that you watch it!But i am waiting to see the later seasons if they air!!! cause that i believe will be interesting!   <br />

    Medaka Box is not quite like Pandora Box which brings doom to the user, but rather it&#039;s a box which bring happiness to the entire school.<br />
<br />
Kurokami Medaka, the main protagonist, is a student council president who won 98% of the voting election, mainly because she promises the existence of Medaka Box : a box which everyone in the school can put in their problems, whether studies, love, family, or any other personal issues, and the student council team will solve it.<br />
<br />
As you may have imagined, Kurokami Medaka is a &#039;superior human&#039;, which means that she can do ALMOST everything alone. She is charismatic, hardworking, trustful,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58687">
        but sometimes can also be a tease to her friends.<br />
<br />
Moving on the the aspects of review :<br />
Story (7)<br />
- Not quite a story plot for the first two episodes. Just Medaka receiving some requests from the students, and she completes it. The plot was only Zenkichi, Medaka&#039;s childhood friend, who joined Student Council to help Medaka doing things that she unable to do. I don&#039;t really agree blending ecchi on Medaka Box, since emphasizing the depth of each story would be a better selling point than fan services.<br />
<br />
Art (8)<br />
- Really liked the drawings. Backgrounds are well done. It&#039;s vivid and bright, reminded me of Baka to Test series.<br />
<br />
Sound (7)<br />
- No special review on this part. The soundtracks pretty well blending inside of the anime&#039;s atmosphere. The opening and ending were quite good, but not as memorable as Accel World&#039;s Chase the World, Sankarea&#039;s Esoragoto, nor Fate/Zero&#039;s to the Beginning.<br />
<br />
Character (8)<br />
- So far, character development goes well. Medaka and Zenkichi couples up nicely and they each covers their partner&#039;s weaknesses. Hope for more appearances of characters in the future.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7)<br />
- Sometimes Medaka Box can be a little bit touching, but sometimes it can also bore you (I don&#039;t really know, but it happened to me). I don&#039;t really expect the third episode, but I think I&#039;m going to continue watching Medaka Box since as we never know the contents of the next box, as there is always an element of surprise in each box, including Medaka Box.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoyed reading my review.<br />
<br />
NB :<br />
This review was written upon seeing the second episode of the show, so some changes may apply in the future. I also didn&#039;t read the manga, which enabled me to give a neutral stand on reviewing Medaka Box by anime solely.<br />

    Going into this I thought it would be a usual Ecchi anime, just fan service and not much story line at all. <br />
But as soon as it starts, there&#039;s a story unfolding. Even if it is small, and not necessarily a proper story straight away, it&#039;s there which is what matters. <br />
The plot lined out in the synopsis shows a pretty common way for Ecchi, but it has a twist that makes it interesting. It isn&#039;t the main focus so there&#039;s been effort put into other parts of the anime for people to enjoy if fan service isn&#039;t just what they want. There isn&#039;t really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232515">
        much of it either, so if you&#039;re just looking for Ecchi, this isn&#039;t a good choice. <br />
<br />
If you like romance, there&#039;s some of that and good comedy too. Little bits of action are put in as well. The anime has a nice feeling to it. The balance between genres and what happens in each episode has a nice flow. <br />
Watching the dub, the voice to mouth sync is a little off at some points but it&#039;s not a big deal. <br />
<br />
Over all it&#039;s worth watching. It&#039;s entertaining and enjoyable. The action and plot quickly kicks in at the end, though in a bit of a weird way but it makes you excited to see what happens in the next season.
