    People can look at this anime anyway they want, but it&#039;ll forever be (for me) a sweet story of how an older brother came to love his sister as any older brother should. So far, every episode managed to unfold into how the two get closer to each other as the older brother helps his sister with common teen problems. <br />
<br />
The story is different from other brother-sister relationship anime. Told from the brother&#039;s point of view, it&#039;s light and has no weird physical and romantic interaction between the two. I like how he started from not even talking to his sister to how he realizes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31477">
        at the end of the day something new or an improvement with his sister. <br />
<br />
Having said that, I like the brother&#039;s character a lot. He&#039;s sort of ideal as a brother. He acts, responds, reacts and shows his love for his sister naturally as how any boy should. On the other hand, his sister depicts any sibling with a whole lot of pride, asking for help from someone you don&#039;t expect to get help from. It&#039;s also fun to watch how she turns to her brother for help and learns to appreciate him.<br />
<br />
Overall this anime is good and is highly recommended to those who would like to see some family values in a different way.

    Every season we seem to get that one show that has all the buzz and word of mouth about it from the anime community.  This time most of that was centered on this anime, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.  I will admit that from the first time I saw details of this show pop up I was not to thrilled with its prospects, but the hype over the show was too much to ignore and I decided to give it a go.  In the end I am left wonder just what was all the fuss about?<br />
<br />
From the start

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33159">
        we are setup with our typical and predictable harem anime plot, a high school guy Kyousuke who is fairly nondescript and normal finds himself involved in his little sister&#039;s secret hobby, eroge games and anime.  Since up till now his sister, Kirino, has basically had nothing to do with him so both her secret and her sudden willingness to open up to him is a complete surprise.  Now he finds himself helping Kirino acquire new eroge, hide her hobby from her friends, help her make new friends, and I suppose repair their sibling relationship.  Seriously a pair of siblings find happiness through the power of eroge!  Are you kidding?  Is this a PSA for the eroge industry?<br />
<br />
Now I haven’t read any of the light novels so I can’t speak for how well this anime does as an adaptation of them.  Though I can say that if this really is a good adaption then I think I will pass.  It’s not that Ore Imouto is a bad anime either; it’s just really uninteresting.  Watching this show wasn&#039;t a chore but I just kept wondering to myself, why isn&#039;t this any good?  I can usually see why someone might like or dislike an anime more that I do but with this one I cant for the life of me understand how anyone could think this one is any good.  The lack of any interesting story makes this anime completely character driven and since the characters are so awful it just feels like it doesn&#039;t get anywhere nor do you care if it does or doesn&#039;t.   Elements of the plot eventually becomes so totally implausible and unrealistic that they defy belief.  <br />
<br />
Overall Ore Imouto is an idealistic view of how otaku and anime fans want to be viewed by others.  It clearly panders to the otaku community and those who fancy themselves as wannabe otaku, i.e. weeaboo’s.  They really aren&#039;t creepy guys who cuddle with full size oppai body pillows on the train or buy an anime special edition box because they have a pair of blue striped panties inside. They are fashion models, Buddhist monks, and super rich oujosama&#039;s!  It’s not that I have anything against otaku mind you, but at the same time I don’t find the lifestyle to be particularly interesting or commendable.  While I do think Ore Imouto tries to deal with some serious issues at times, Kirino&#039;s character makes it impossible to really accept them.  On the plus side I will give the anime credit for not caving in completely to the fan base by drowning the show in pervy fan service.<br />
<br />
The main issue overall with the story is there is too little of everything.  There isn’t any story to speak of, though that would probably be ok if it was completely episodic, but it’s not.  We start out with Kirino&#039;s hobby being laid out and the drama that unfolds as her best friend and her father find out about it.  Both are coincidentally very anti-anime/eroge.  Though I can’t really blame them really too much for the later, I mean she is in middle school for god&#039;s sake and watching/playing those things is technically illegal for her.  Kyousuke stands up for her every time along the way.  It actually sounds kind of inspiring and sweet but it isn’t (more on why later).  <br />
<br />
The romantic elements don’t work either, since we really aren’t given much about each character to think there is even a relationship developing.  There is really no chemistry between any of the characters either.  This is mostly due to Kyousuke&#039;s complete and utter lack of anything resembling personality.  The ending is also bad, but not unexpected given the genre and this lack of chemistry.  <br />
<br />
The lead Kyousuke is without a doubt one of the most uninteresting characters I have seen in recent memory.  He seems to exemplify the ordinary lifeless harem lead.  It seems he has absolutely no interests of his own.  A look into his room shows a barren waste that lacks even the most Spartan decor and might as well just be a room at a hotel.  I think his room tells you a lot about him because like him, the only time it contains anything is when it belongs to someone else.  He is like an empty glass, waiting to be filled by whomever he comes into contact with.  I mean sure, he is a really nice guy.  He helps his sister and her friends whenever they need him, every time!  All of this without any thought or expectation of a reward.  However it feels more like he does out of sheer boredom than anything else.  He doesn’t seem to really care one way or the other about anyone, especially his sister.  You get the feeling that he’s helping her out of an obligation as her brother.  Of course why would he like, let alone love her or want to help her for any other reason?  She’s nothing but a complete bitch to him anyway.<br />
<br />
Kirino is on the surface your standard tsundere archetype.  Visually she’s got everything that makes for otaku wet dreams but under the pretty exterior lays one of ugliest and most unsympathetic characters in anime.  There is a really fine line to walk when doing tsundere characters.  The difference &quot;tsundere&quot; and a &quot;bitch&quot; is extremely small.  Kirino falls squarely on the side of the bitch.  Her actions are not cute nor are they even funny.  She’s conniving, mean-spirited, selfish, vain, disloyal, and wholly unlikable.  Despite apparently &quot;loving&quot; her brother she treats him totally opposite, in true tsundere fashion but unlike most characters in this archetype she never backs down at all from this role.  She uses everyone in the cast for her own selfish wants and then casts them away when she doesn’t need them anymore.  Unable to even stay true to her new otaku friends she shuns them as soon as her &quot;cool&quot; personality and friendship with the “in crowd” is threatened.  Additionally she is utterly unbelievable as a character.  We are supposed to believe she is popular, athletic, a professional model, successful novelist, an imouto, AND an otaku?  All before even entering high school?  Right...<br />
<br />
By the end of the anime little has changed for either Kirino or Kyousuke.  They haven’t grown at all as characters or as people.  Kyousuke remains an emotionless robotic proxy with no will or dreams of his own and still unable to see all the girls throwing themselves at his corpse of a personality.  If Kirino had become better at expressing her love for her brother and her friends or even learned to embrace her hobby openly without care as to what other people thought, it might have made her character easier to take.<br />
<br />
With lead characters this bad it really makes the supporting characters seem even worse by comparison, or better depending on who you’re talking about.  The downside is everyone with the exception of Kuroneko and to a lesser degree Manami.  Manami is Kyousuke&#039;s childhood friend and I suppose defacto girlfriend was a likable character who I actually felt pity for than anything else.  She is poorly developed and mostly ignored by the plot but from a cast that is so poorly conceived she stands as a lone bright spot.  In a better cast and with better leads she is probably lost as just an also-ran character.<br />
<br />
Kuroneko on the other hand is different.  She is actually a really interesting and well implemented character.  As one of Kirino&#039;s new otaku friends she is basically everything that Kirino is not.  She is true to herself and loyal to her friends.  She is responsible and trustworthy and has her priorities in line.  In one episode that shows her taking care of her little sister you can see from her actions that she honestly loves her sibling as she plays with her, puts up with her favorite anime, which she despises but she does so anyway.  Although she is well aware that people and even her family thinks she is weird and abnormal, she doesn’t care and does as she likes.  Because it gives her enjoyment.  In my opinion Kirino doesn’t deserve her as a friend.  Of all the people in this cast the only one I would want to hang out with willingly and be friends with is her.<br />
<br />
Ore Imouto&#039;s visual aspects are top notch however.  The character designs are pleasing to the eye and well proportioned.  The settings and backgrounds are well done though a bit bland in some cases.  Kirino&#039;s room is probably the most interesting with the most amount of things lying about.  Some of the visual parodies and references to other anime and games I found were pretty amusing.  Particularly those relating to Fate/Stay Night which appeared several times.   I did enjoy the lack of tits and ass from the production and that went a long way towards making the show far less perverse as I had initially assumed it would be.<br />
<br />
The seiyuu cast is also strong, featuring Ayana Takeatsu fresh off her success as Azusa from K-ON in the title role.  It’s too bad she wasn’t given a better character to work with, but I think she played the part as well as it could have been.  Other favorites of mine such as Yukari Tamura and Saori Hayami play smaller roles but overall I found all the performances to be very good.  The music is a definite strength as well; ChariS OP &quot;irony&quot; is one of the better anime songs of the year.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it Ore Imouto is the kind of disposable anime that comes along every year.  While it got more than its share of hype and press it is unlikely to be remembered in the years to come.  I don’t necessarily think this is a terrible show, it has aspects that I think are terrible but overall I can’t say I hated it either.  It had just enough to keep my interest from week to week and little else.  I suggest you ignore the hype and skip this anime.  If you want to see an anime about otaku that doesn’t pander to them, watch Kuragehime instead.  You can thank me later.<br />

    Overview:<br />
<br />
I continue on my quest to explore new genres of anime and review really odd stuff. &quot;Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai&quot; roughly translates to &quot;I can&#039;t believe my little sister is this cute!&quot; I will call this title Oreimo for the rest of this review because honestly the full title is WAY too long. Much like one of my all time favorite spoof movies: Don&#039;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our main character is an obnoxious teenage male who is upset that his little sister doesn&#039;t bring him breakfast in bed and act like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184871">
        the cutesy little sisters in the anime he likes. The little sister is loud, irritating, and all things stereo-typically &quot;Tsundere&quot;. One day the elder brother discovers that his little sister is REALLY into lolicon anime and videogames along with incest, and her favorite: Lolicon/incest together. This makes the brother immediately fall in love with his little sister and try grope her while she sleeps. My reaction...WHAT!? I am an elder brother myself and if I suddenly found out my little brother was a passionate member of NAMBLA, my first reaction would NOT be....&quot;man, I really want to fuck my brother right now!&quot; Of course, our MC meets his little sister&#039;s friends who are also ridiculous otaku stereotypes and it becomes a generic harem anime only with lots of wincest and loli! Hooray! Seriously, FUCK this anime!<br />
<br />
Some anime are made &quot;by Otaku for Otaku&quot; to the complete exclusion of everyone else. I&#039;m Ok with this. We all have our own likes and dislikes and not every show and movie has to be aimed at everyone. However, this anime absolutely embraces every negative stereotype about otaku and tries to pander to the lowest common denominator. I found this not only bad, but rather insultingly bad. I love anime as a medium of storytelling, but I fucking HATED this show. The parents in this show are &quot;big meanies&quot; who don&#039;t understand the joys of being an anime geek and try to negatively judge our heroes. However, I don&#039;t feel this show does a good job representing anime fans and defending us against those that dislike anime! For example, just because I like to read manga by Naoki Urosawa instead of reading comics by Stan Lee, doesn&#039;t mean I: collect hundreds of figurines, live in my parent&#039;s basement, buy hundreds of dollars worth of hentai, am a pedophile, am incestuous, or lack any semblance of social skills. Embracing these stereotypes doesn&#039;t represent our cause as anime fans or encourage others to give anime a chance! If you want to see a GOOD anime about the anti-otaku stigma in Japan and living the life of a secret otaku, watch the anime &quot;Welcome to the NHK!&quot; If OreImo was made as a satire attacking anime fans and encouraging people to NOT watch anime, it would be a crude, low blow but relatively effective. As a PRO-otaku show that acts as if it is the most wonderful, loving tribute to otaku everywhere, this show is a fucking failure!<br />

Now for the question you have all been asking: &quot;why did this piece of shit get a 2/10 instead of a 1/10?&quot;. The answer is that the comedy in this series is so stupid it&#039;s almost funny. It isn&#039;t actually funny, but it&#039;s almost funny in the way that Tim and Eric the Awesome Show is sort of funny in that oh so popular anti-humor style. This show&#039;s relentless awkwardness that it puts the audience through and totally bizarre style of &quot;humor&quot; almost reminded me of something Andy Kaufman would do. He was a famous...&quot;comedian&quot; well known for stunts like pulling out a copy of The Great Gatsby during a stand up comedy performance and reading it aloud...and just kept going. Eventually this created some nervous laughter from the audience because it was just so awkward and they had no idea how to react...then eventually they got up and left and he just kept on reading aloud. That is basically what this anime is like. At first you sort of chuckle with nervous laughter just because it is so WTF...then eventually you realize that...this is it, this is the whole thing...so you get up and leave. Or you finish the whole series if you are a complete masochist.<br />

    &#039;Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai&#039; (Long titles for the win) is one of those animes I just can&#039;t figure out. On the surface it appears to be an anime about a brother and a sister who struggle to realise their feelings for each other. But in reality it is about much more than that. We have a good chunk of the story here focused on anime and the world of otakus as well as the friendships that one can gain simply by going outside and meeting new people. <br />
<br />
That said, the plot&#039;s main purpose is to of course present us the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68677">
        life of siblings who, as is often the case, display aggression and hostility towards each other but in reality care deeply for one another. <br />
<br />
The two main characters, Kyosuke and Kirino Kousaka are complete opposites when it comes to their personalities. Kyosuke is a kind and mostly peaceful person who enjoys &#039;ordinary and average things&#039; - his words. He also happens to be quite possibly the unluckiest person on the planet, often blamed for things he didn&#039;t do and accidents he didn&#039;t cause. Add to that the fact that he&#039;ll do anything for his unappreciative sister and you&#039;ve got the perfect recipe for a martyr-type character. Indeed the suffering this character will go through in this series is immense. <br />
<br />
His sister, Kirino, is a spoiled brat with a serious attitude problem, completely cold and hostile towards her brother. She&#039;s a tsundere without the dere part. She behaves similarly to other people apart from her two closest friends. This character annoyed me to no end and at times I just wanted to drop the series simply because I couldn&#039;t listen to her constant complaining and her ways of screwing up her brother&#039;s reputation in the eyes of many many people. Ironically however, her tsun( no dere) behaviour perfectly fits in with the plot in this series and without that disgustingly hostile behaviour this anime would not be complete. <br />
<br />
We have a few other supporting characters of course, the tall and mysterious Saori, the intelligent and menacing Kuroneko (real name Ruri Gokou) and perhaps the most relaxing character to grace the screens of anime watchers across the world - Manami. <br />
<br />
Kuroneko is your typical gothic style anime watcher who mostly spends her days writing novels that even native Japanese-speakers wouldn&#039;t be able to read. Her vocabulary is vast and getting in an argument with her is always going to end bad for the challenger. <br />
<br />
Saori is... tall. There&#039;s not much I can say about her apart from that because this series simply does not giver her enough time. From what we see we can make out that she&#039;s quite geeky and she simply enjoys spending time with her friends.<br />
<br />
Manami is a hard working and kind person - mature beyond her years. Let me put it this way, if I was looking for a life long partner she&#039;s the person I would try to get to know better. No wonder then that Kyousuke prefers to spend every free minute he has with her. A lot of characters in this anime see them as a couple and Manami&#039;s grandfather is trying every trick in the book to push their relationship to the next level. Hilarious stuff.<br />
<br />
The art is staggering. It&#039;s extremely precise and all the lines and curves are perfectly drawn. The characters look beautiful and attention has been paid to every single detail. Likewise the music is spot on and voice acting accurate and authentic. <br />
<br />
The enjoyment part of this anime is... something I had to think hard about. On one hand if you&#039;re into the whole tsundere/martyr thing then go ahead you will enjoy this series, especially since it&#039;s very realistic. But if you get easily annoyed by one character complaining about trivial matters over and over and over again every single episode then you will definitely sit there unsatisfied and more than likely, agitated. But if you ignore that one character then this anime becomes a paradise since it also focuses on the daily struggles of otakus. That&#039;s what had me thinking the whole time, this is an anime about anime (ANIMESEPUSHION!) and also a lot of other things that go with it. <br />
<br />
Personally, despite Kirino&#039;s horrendous personality, I enjoyed this series. It is what it is. Don&#039;t go into it expecting it to be a masterpiece and don&#039;t take it too seriously either and you&#039;ll have fun.

         This anime was a pleasant surprise.  It has an interesting take on the bro-sis relationship.  The two siblings treat each other like most do in the real world, with dislike, indifference, hate and of course love.  It has an intriguing plot to begin with and as the story unfolds it actually makes you care about the characters.  <br />
     I found the characters refreshing and liked how they seemed to change as the story advanced.  Most of them seemed to be more well thought out than your usual 2d run of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48201">
        mill stooges.  Having been limited to 15 episodes I thought they did well fleshing them out.   Though a couple could use more depth and emotion. <br />
     The art work was pretty good and was what I kind of of expected in a anime of this type.  The girls looked like girls and not some barbie dolls.  I also like that they didn&#039;t revert to using childish miniatures.  The people pretty much seemed like the age they were portraying. <br />
     Overall this is a funny, heartwarming, fun look at a brother and sister who are trying to figure out if they love or hate one another.  Do yourself a favor and give it a watch.

    &#039;Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai! (My Little Sister Can&#039;t Possibly be this Adorable!)&#039; is about an ordinary high school student (Kyousuke), who one day discovered his usually rude and rebellious little sister (Kirino) is a closet otaku. One thing leads to another, Kyousuke ends up helping his little sister with many otaku things.<br />
After a quick glance at the title and plot synopsis, I thought this was some kind of incest harem comedy, and had an extremely low expectation. However, as the story progressed, a nagging thought began to dwell in my mind: &quot;This Show Can&#039;t Possibly be this Enjoyable!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The story is

        driven by Kirino&#039;s selfish &quot;Life Consultations&quot; about her otaku hobby, getting her brother into all sorts of trouble. I know a lot of people are going to compare this with &#039;Genshiken&#039; series, but it&#039;s quite different. &#039;Genshiken&#039; focuses on different kinds of otaku, and how the protagonist fit in with fellow otaku around him. On the other hand, &#039;OreImo&#039; is very much about the otaku culture seen from an average person&#039;s view, and depicts how the heroine&#039;s hobby is exposed to ordinary friends and adults around her. Most characters around Kirino represent a social group that she must seek acceptance from.<br />
<br />
Her brother Kyousuke is open-minded and willing to learn new things for his little sister. Members in this group are quite rare, but accept others quickly.<br />
The father is an old-fashioned conservative. Fortunately for Kirino, the dad is a reasonable man, and allows her to continue under certain conditions. It can also be said that when society is exposed to something new for a certain time, it eventually becomes a norm and become accepted.<br />
Then comes Ayase, the misinformed. She&#039;s the type who believes everything she sees in TV, and forms prejudice in her mind. This type, as demonstrated in the series, can be converted with sufficient counter-evidence.<br />
Finally, we have Kanako, who just despises and disgusted by otaku&#039;s creepiness... this type is probably inconvertible, but fortunately she likes to be worshipped, and otaku provide her that.<br />
<br />
Then we have the fellow otaku friends, Saori, who tries everything but doesn&#039;t become particularly attached to anything, and then Kuroneko, who like Kirino is very passionate about a certain genre, and unwilling to budge. These characters broaden Kirino&#039;s otaku life by introducing her to new things and opinions.<br />
<br />
Like &#039;Genshiken&#039;, the story here does involves a wide range of otaku activities such as anime, eroge, live commentary, comic fest, cosplay, otagei and additionally production of fan novel and anime. I found it interesting that this show has a lot of self-reference with the anime production episode where a lot of ideas such as use of different ED and real stores as anime location, as well as the difficulty in maintaining original plots for anime adaptations. In the eroge episode, it shows the irony of Kirino&#039;s attitude toward her brother through an eroge, in which Kirino found a character very similar to her to be very annoying, and subtly realizes her own emotion. In the novel episode, it also touched on how the recent trend of moe and ecchi was degrading anime, but stated that in the end, all art works are subject of personal preferences, and there&#039;s no real &quot;correct&quot; answer.<br />
<br />
One nagging question throughout the series was &quot;why would Kyousuke go such lengths to help his sister when she`s acting like such a bitch all the time&quot;, but Kirino eventually became quite adorable because she`s such an earnest girl who gives 100% at everything she does.<br />
Kyousuke was a really likable guy who went out and got things done for his little sister, with couple of great quick thinking in critical times. The whole theme of brotherly love was beautifully summarized in the final episode. I have to admit it was sort of corny, but a fitting ending nonetheless. The irony that the one time he wasn&#039;t able to make a composed decision was in an argument with his own sister, and the reverse effect actually led to the desired result.<br />
<br />
Another one may be &quot;why is Kirino so bitchy to her brother when he&#039;s doing so much good for her?&quot; Kirino is what they call 「ギャル」 (Gyaru) in Japan, fashion/trend-conscious girls. One of their major characteristics is that they call their parents and brothers 「きもっ」 (Gross) or 「うざっ」 (Annoying) and avoid them because these girls don&#039;t want to be seen as a baby who still clings on to the family, or don&#039;t want to be associated with the uncool. Kirino&#039;s character is basically stereotypical gyaru who also happens to be a tsundere, therefore the constant abuse of her brother. It was apparent that her behavior was also her clumsy way of expressing her affection and need for attention from her big brother. There&#039;s also a Japanese saying 「喧嘩するほど仲がいい」 &quot;They get along so well that they fight all the time&quot;, as in two people are so close that they don&#039;t need to hold anything back, and you wouldn&#039;t get mad at someone you don&#039;t care about. One can say the argument and even physical violence in the end was a milestone in the improvement of their relationship, especially compared to beginning of the series when Kirino outright ignored her brother.<br />
<br />
Just from Kirino&#039;s character setting alone, you can tell this show was never meant to be a realistic portrayal of otaku culture, as gyaru and otaku have long been depicted in media as arch-enemies of incompatible personalities.<br />
As a fantasy series, it was a really well-structured story designed to be heartwarming, building up for drama and inspiration almost every episode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art work was the weakest element of the show. Neither characters nor backgrounds were usually detailed. In fact, it was noticeably cheap, but the lazy `ordinary life` atmosphere and hectic otaku madness was presented well.<br />
Character designs are a bit heavy on moe, but quite distinguishable. I did not like how their faces were too wide in some scenes.<br />
Animation, like every other element of this show, had its moments. There are few scenes, mostly action or background had so much detail or great camera work that it takes you by surprise.<br />
<br />
Voice acting of the siblings are done extremely well. Kirino usually sound annoying and bitchy like she should, and turn cute in dere scenes. You can just feel the emotion of her voice in touching scenes, and the squirmy perv laughs were adorable. Kyousuke&#039;s voice was smooth and easy to listen to. All other seiyuu cast were solid in my opinion, except Satou Satomi (Manami), whose high-pitch voice was overly moe and unnaturally childish for a 17-year old character.<br />
The heavy use of brass instruments in BGM was rather refreshing, but overall the music score did not leave a lasting impression. It did occasionally help set the pace for comedy or drama.<br />
The OP (song quality, suitability, visual presentation) is excellent. `Irony` by Claris itself is like a random technopop from Japanese idol group Perfume minus the auto-tune, but surprisingly catchy and appropriate in setting the mood for each episode. OP animation is always different, introducing the side characters that will appear for each episode and having same theme as the episode.<br />
ED songs are different for every episode, ED1-11 are selected from the public contest held in Nico Nico Douga, a Japanese video sharing website, and sang by seiyuu cast in this series. ED songs were pretty weak in general with excessive beats, but at least offer refreshment value. ED12 was written by Kousaki Satoru (who also handled BGM), and really shows the difference between pros and amateurs. ED vocals were insanely good though, especially for episode 4, 7, 8, and 11.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite being a late night UHF (independent station) anime about otaku, `OreImo` is very much a mainstream show designed for the general audience. I would think the more immersed in otaku culture you are, the more likely you will prefer `Genshiken` over this series because it goes far more in-depth on otaku culture.<br />
However, this show is more of a feel-good sweet fairytale story about platonic brotherly and sisterly love. I wouldn`t go as far as saying this series is life/perspective-altering in any way, but it also sheds light on issues an otaku would face in real life, and attainment of acceptance by the general public, though a bit too much of an otaku glorification.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s obvious a lot of effort was put into production, such as the revision of story structure which gave subtle character development despite the episodic format, the different &quot;Eye Catch&quot; (Cover/CD between commercials) as reference to other anime series, &quot;End Card&quot; (illustration that shows in end of the show, sometimes displayed in ED as well) drawn by various prominent manga/novel illustrators, different OP animation every episode (and sometimes use of OP in different places), and different EDs.<br />
<br />
This series is not perfect as the drama feel a bit too forced at times, but it`s not about the logic... there`s something about it that really touches you. Watching this show naturally puts a smile on my face.<br />
<br />
I really like &#039;OreImo&#039;, I would even say that I LOVE it!<br />

    Ore no Imouto is an entertaining and cute comedy that was thoroughly pleasant almost every moment. Those are basically the 2 things it offers, cuteness and comedy. But what makes it special is the unique brand of tsundere that the main female character, Kirino, possesses. The story is shown from the viewpoint of her brother, Kyousuke, which allows you, the viewer, to also be on the receiving end of Kirino&#039;s cuteness, which is particularly cute because of the complexity of her relationship with Kyousuke.<br />
<br />
The main female characters look unbelievable cute, sound cute, and behave cutely, and it&#039;s a sexy-cute, not a childish cute. The cuteness

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31980">
        doesn&#039;t feel forced at all. It just naturally exudes from their personalities.<br />
<br />
I snicker and giggle the whole way through because it&#039;s very funny, just the kind of humor I love. There&#039;s no slapstick, gags, or chibi transformations, which tend to be mildly funny at best. This is quality humor.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not all humor. The experiences they have and problems they overcome feel good to watch, and they haven&#039;t felt forced so far. Rather, they are quite natural.<br />
<br />
The characters are wonderful. They seem very real. The main characters, Kyousuke, the brother, and Kirino, the sister, have a very believable relationship where they sort of act like they just &quot;tolerate&quot; each other, yet very much do care for each other and both know it, but coming out and saying it bluntly would be embarrassing. It&#039;s really a very common type of sibling rivalry/relationship.<br />
<br />
Understanding this relationship is key to your enjoyment of the show. It seems many viewers don&#039;t understand this and so they think that Kirino is an unrealistically ungrateful bitch and her brother unrealistically puts up with it without complaint. But ironically, if you understand that they are really just pretending to only just &quot;tolerate&quot; each other, but really care about each other, this is what makes the show very unique and realistic. And it&#039;s why Kirino is so darn cute. So try to understand this while watching, and look for the hidden message or vibe that Kirino is sending even when she acts angry, and never take her &quot;mean&quot; act literally.<br />
<br />
Kyousuke is a great character, and seems to act just how I would want him to act. He&#039;s cool, reliable, sharp, and witty. Kirino is a tsundere-type character, but doesn&#039;t seem at all like a cliche. Kyousuke will sacrifice himself for his sister, which makes for some great moments as it breaks down Kirino &quot;defenses&quot; and forces her to acknowledge her brother&#039;s sacrifices with a grudging but sincere &quot;thanks&quot;.  The other characters have strong personalities as well.<br />
<br />
The colors in the animation are bold and detailed, and camera angles and viewpoints are always keeping it fresh. The music complements the scenes very well, often breaking into the great &quot;theme song&quot; during feel-good resolutions of Kirino&#039;s problems when both Kyousuke and the viewers are rewarded with Kirino&#039;s cute fighting spirit or her grudging show of gratitude. It actually feels on par with an epic climatic scene in some lengthy drama.<br />
<br />
Towards the end of the series, there were some things I didn&#039;t like. The transition from one scene to another was sometimes very sudden, and some details that were important for the next scene were not sufficiently explained, almost like they were short on time and had to condense things. This happens in the last two episodes. In fact, the climatic moment in the final episode is extremely sudden, has no foreshadowing that I can see leading up to it, isn&#039;t clear whether it is intentional or accidental on the part of Kirino, and leaves me to have to wonder and speculate about what Kirino&#039;s thought&#039;s were leading up to the moment. I feel like Kirino should have shown signs that she was dealing with a tough dilemma, then we would then wonder what it was, and then the climatic moment would provide the answer. But as it is, it just leaves me puzzled.<br />
<br />
But overall, this was one of my favorite shows. It was hilarious, cute, and the best part is the unique personality of Kirino that is full of cute subtleties which I can easily relate to. Not your typical tsundere.

    Ore no Imouto is an uncommon example of a show that has fantastic production, but abominable execution. The concept is fairly original, featuring a younger sister who has a problem fitting in society as a high achieving student who is also balancing a hobby for collecting and playing imouto-themed eroge. While the show is beautiful with its detailed character/background designs, unique EDs for each episode, and decent voice acting, the show amounts to being almost completely worthless and an insult to the representation of otaku culture and the associated stigmas.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start off with the single worst thing about this show: Kirino.  Kirino is many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32895">
        things.  She is a high achieving middle school student, a model, and an obsessive anime/eroge fan.  However above all, she is selfish, stubborn, and blatantly insensitive.  The latter qualities are something you usually give to either a villain, or anti-heroic character.  Kirino unfortunately is neither of those.  She is the heroine of the plot, and for the large part is never reprimanded for her flaws. It says little about the other characters of the story - especially her brother - when people around Kirino basically enable her unhealthy obsessions over imouto-themed eroge. For almost the entire series, Kirino is a bitch to her brother Kyousuke, who ends up becoming Kirino&#039;s bitch, slaving away to ensure Kirino gets everything she wants to feed her anime and eroge obsessions.  Is Kirino ever grateful? Not really. Up to the very last episode, she&#039;s still the same insensitive brat who wants to have her cake and eat it too, and she never truly apologizes for any of the illogically horrible things she does to her older brother.<br />
<br />
What was this show trying to accomplish?  Was this meant to be a comedy?  I didn&#039;t find it particularly funny when Kirino was kicking Kyosuke in the balls or ordering him to get run over by a truck for the sake of research. Was this meant to be a slice of life drama? Again what kind of a character would be ordering her older brother to get run over by a truck for crying out loud? Was this a tale of fantasy?  Maybe, because I sure as hell doubt that humans in the real world value villainous characters who get to have their cake and eat it too.  And yes, I do mean it when I say Kirino is villainous.  She deliberately goes out of her way to be cruel to people who help her, and she absolutely insists on having her way at all costs.<br />
<br />
Does this show even do anything good?  Actually the first few episodes do manage to get your attention.  See, the concept for this show was actually decently original. There is a good number of people who would be able to relate to Kirino&#039;s problems of finding acceptance in her unusual hobbies.  Furthermore AIC is big on production values and they do a fairly impressive job of detailing some of the trips to Akihabara, conventions, cosplay contests, and a few other things. The unique EDs (and OP animations) don&#039;t hurt either.  This show really did have the framework set up to be something great.  But it&#039;s a huge insult to anime fans how despicable of a character Kirino is. Why does Kirino resent her brother so much?  Is it because she doesn&#039;t interact with him much?  Heck I have a younger sister who I interact with on an infrequent basis, and she likes anime.  But she has no reason to disdain me to the irrational extent Kirino does. And I consider myself a pretty strong anime fan, but Kirino is beyond obsessed in her collection of anime merchandise that takes up an entire closet space, and she is never grateful for all the trouble her brother goes to to add to that gigantic collection.<br />
<br />
If there is a lesson to be learned from this show, it is not one about social acceptance.  More importantly, the main character of a story has to be appealing. In the end, Ore no Imouto makes many promises, but keeps none of them. By far the disappointment of Fall 2010, it is easily one of the worst shows AIC has produced by far.

    Believe me when I say to you, this is not what you were expecting. I&#039;ve found brother-sister anime to be all either A: incestuous, or B: Completely boring. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai takes the brand new option C: Incredible. I consider myself to watch things that have a decent amount of quality to them. I don&#039;t like to waste my time watching things that end up wasting my time. After reading the description of this anime, I brushed it aside. However, after taking notice that there was quite a bit of support for the anime, I changed my mind one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32925">
        boring Tuesday afternoon and downloaded the first three episodes. By the end of the first episode, I was completely immersed in the engaging storyline and the complex characters. Rarely does an anime bring me into the world of its characters, and rarely do I find myself connecting on a personal level with characters in the anime. I won&#039;t waste your time: if you&#039;re already interested in this anime, watch it. You don&#039;t even need to read the rest of this review. I&#039;ll say it right now: you&#039;re in for a real treat today.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
When I first read the description here on MAL, I was skeptical. Very skeptical. Slice of life anime doesn&#039;t always have the most engaging plot structure. It tends to lack a definite climax, and often times, it seems like there&#039;s a lot left unresolved. However, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (further referenced as Ore no Imouto) was different. The first episode immerses you into its storyline, pulling you into its characters and plot, and each successive episode only serves to pull you in deeper. What was wonderful about this anime was its humor. Simply put, the story is about the strengthening of the bond between a brother and sister. The humor in this anime comes from the relationship a brother and a sister have, and, at times, the boundaries that are set by a society for a brother and sister. The story progresses as the main character&#039;s younger sister needs his help more and more. I won&#039;t give any sort of definite summary in this review. All I want to say is that the story moves continuously, there is no junk anywhere in this anime. Furthermore, the storyline is more than engaging enough to keep anyone entertained. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t find the artwork to be all too impressive. However, it was plainly effective for what it set out to do. However, I would like to comment on the work that was done within anime of other fictional animes. Throughout the anime, there are other anime that appear as part of the interests of certain characters. The illustrators of Ore no Imouto did a fabulous job distinguishing the different tastes between Kirino and Kuroneko (Ruri). The contrast between these two characters made by the artwork shown in the anime that they watch greatly adds to the impression given to the reader that they&#039;re both crazy otaku, with wildly different tastes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
I personally found no enjoyment out of the audio in this anime. While it wasn&#039;t terrible, it wasn&#039;t just outstanding. It fit the anime, which is of course what was important, but it couldn&#039;t stand up to the level of artistic intuition of the other 3 categories. It just wasn&#039;t there. There wasn&#039;t a place to put it even. Not that I can complain. The entire anime is consumed with substantial dialogue that really makes it what it is.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
Characters make this anime what it is. The characters in this anime are perfectly matched to create the perfect story. In my opinion, story is nothing without characters. The characters perfectly meld together to form interesting situations, which result in multiple laugh out loud moments. I think most people will agree that they don&#039;t laugh to themselves very often when they watch an anime. I laughed quite a few times, but at other times, this anime can capture your heart, because again, the relationship between a brother and a sister can become quite emotional. This is seen towards the end of the anime, and it is very emotional. Kyousuke Kousuka, played by Yuuichi Nakamura is the perfect older brother for this anime. By far my favorite character, his sarcastic commentary and his use of logic contrast brilliantly with his little sister&#039;s illogical and child-like desires, which seemingly have no bounds and which is he almost forced to accept. And that&#039;s just two of the characters. And normally, that&#039;s what you get out of an anime. The main characters are good, but usually, your supporting actors and actresses are a little boring. I loved several of the supporting characters in this anime, and I wish they could have made it longer so that their part in the story and their relationship with the main character could be made more definite, especially the Kyousuke and Kirino&#039;s friends, Akagi, Manami, and Ayase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
Despite what the anime lacked, I really enjoyed it. I don&#039;t think any sort of review will truly do this anime justice. This is easily one of the most humorous anime I have ever seen, with a witty and clever take on the relationship between a brother and sister. The anime kept its focus, and thereby keeps its viewers interested in the storyline and wanting more. The only problem I had with this anime was that it actually ended with only 12 episodes. Such a wonderful anime should have gone on longer, however I am definitely satisfied with the impact it left me. <br />
<br />
Just a few concluding remarks: I&#039;d like to say this is not a ecchi incestuous anime. Although it at times hints towards that kind of anime, and although eroge does play a part in this anime, it is not actually between the two main characters. This anime seriously examines what it means to have a sibling, and the implications involved. This anime is truly something to be enjoyed for its outlook on the responsibilities of an older brother to his younger sister, and what it truly means to be there, selflessly sacrificing yourself, when someone really needs you.<br />

    Sisters. They can sure be a pain, and I know based on experience. They might cause you trouble and make you unhappy at times, but they really don&#039;t want that deep down. This seems to be the case in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (My Little Sister Can&#039;t Be This Cute), but maybe it was taken a little too far. I&#039;ll explain later.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
Let me go over the story real quick. Kyousuke finds an eroge game in a DVD case. Kirino talks with him and reveals her hidden side; she&#039;s goes gaga for little sister eroges. Kyousuke decides to help her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32890">
        out with &quot;life counseling&quot; sessions to get her to open up with her secret hobby. I&#039;m not gonna lie, it&#039;s an interesting story, to say the least. I mean we can all relate. We have secrets we might not want others to know. The problem for me is that it felt stereotypical and predictable. It had some twists near the end. but for the most part, I knew what was going to happen. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was quite sudden, which seemed forced to fit into the 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
I&#039;m not gonna say much about this. Nothing spectacular. Quite generic. The end.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
I wasn&#039;t impressed by the sound used. The OP and EDs are forgettable. I honestly can&#039;t remember much that stood out at all. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
This is what made me really dislike this show. I don&#039;t care what anybody says; I hate Kirino with a passion so strong, it can only be compared to the force of a thousand suns. She was utterly useless for nearly the entirety of the series. I guess this is a little biased, because I hate people who care only about themselves, but that&#039;s just me. To me, she&#039;s a terrible person. She&#039;s not the only problem. Kyousuke, for example. He bland and boring. He has his moments, but they&#039;re scarce. This show has good characters though, like Manami and her grandfather. The problem is that they barely get any screen time, especially the grandfather who&#039;s only in one episode. Kuroneko and Saori are pretty alright characters as well, but they can&#039;t save the show.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a story that had potential. It could have gone deeper, explaining the difficult relationship between Kyousuke helping Kirino accept the she has a hobby that she can&#039;t keep secret forever, but instead, we get a whiny sister and a boring brother doing stereotypical otaku things. I guess they really tried to appeal to otakus and weeaboos.

    Ore no Imouto or My Little Sister Can&#039;t be this Cute is quite possibly one of the most deceptive anime I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Initially I stayed away from this show because I was quite weary of the rather ludicrous premise and the title made me think I was in for another incest anime. However, like any other hyped anime, sometimes one just has to see what is the deal with the popularity.<br />
<br />
First of all, I&#039;ll admit that the initial episodes showed promising signs. My fears of this turning into some sort of incestual fetish anime were dispelled almost immediately, and better yet, the premise while

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39489">
        rather ridiculous was merely a vehicle for a much more well grounded and relateable plot. At the beginning of the show, our main protagonist Kyousuke is seen to be in a rather broken relationship with his younger sister Kirino until, by accident, discovers that his sister is an closet otaku who apparently loves eroge games involving little sisters. The later confrontations over this fact would later lead to Kyousuke getting involved in his sister&#039;s secret lifestyle, and it is quite possible for this once broken sibling relationship to make amends over the glorious hobbies of an otaku.<br />
<br />
Despite all this, my initial positive impression of this show would quickly go down the drain. The show which initially presented itself both seriously and earnestly, became very dishonest. I really was tricked into thinking that they&#039;d treat the otaku issues at least semi-seriously. The way those around her accept her as is puts me in utter disbelief. What was the point of her hiding her hobby in the first place if it was going to seem so easy to get more out in the open with it?<br />
<br />
I should have honestly seen the warning signs. Why of course, not only is our otaku in this show a moe bait girl, but she is also presented as absolutely perfect in anything she does. It&#039;s both hard to sympathize and care for the character Kirino when almost everything always works out for her.This is further exasperated by the protagonist and side character&#039;s willingness to be at her beckon call whenever a problem does arrive.<br />
<br />
It is quite apparent by at least the mid point of this show, that all Ore no Imouto truly wanted to be was some clever marketing scheme to create an otaku wish fulfillment fantasy anime. If there is one thing that I do not appreciate in anime, it is being patronized by the creators of a show. And my god, this show was certainly an insult to my intelligence.<br />
<br />
I say this of course without even mentioning just how insufferable Kirino is. Tsundere is the sort of trope where if you execute it well, you probably have a decent character in your grasp, but if you make a mess out of it, you get Louise from ZnT, and trust me, that&#039;s not a good thing...<br />
<br />
There are not many shows where the mere presence of one character seems to drag down the rest of the cast with them. Each and every character is bashed to death with the stupid stick anytime a situation with Kirino arises, in particular the main character Kyousuke. The only saving grace in the cast ever being the goth lolita charcter Kuroneko (They should just a spin off series about her). Hey even I admit that she&#039;s a bitch, but at least she&#039;s a bitch I can find amusing and sympathize with. There&#039;s absolutely nothing sympathetic about the character Kirino. She expresses belligerent behavior to those around her, especially her brother, without consequence and we&#039;re supposed to sit here and laugh.<br />
<br />
This is merely another breaking point in my suspension of disbelief (As if I hadn&#039;t reached that threshold already to some degree) for this anime. One cannot simply accept that a brother, Kyousuke, who supposedly hates his sister, would go to hell and back for a sister that shows anything but kindness to him. It just doesn&#039;t make sense. Either Kyousuke is one of the greatest saints I have seen in fiction or the writing here is just terrible and breaks characterization. To say the least, it&#039;s not enjoyable to watch either way.<br />
<br />
To sum it up without ranting too much about this trash series... If you dislike tsunderes, stay away. If you dislike otaku-wish fulfillment animes, stay away. If you are looking for a real down to earth exploration of a sibling relationship. I repeat, stay away.<br />
<br />
All we have here is an otaku wish fulfillment anime centralized around a Mary Sue character. If that is something you enjoy, go ahead. Otherwise, you have been warned.<br />

    Can&#039;t say much off of the first episode except that the characters are pretty original.  I especially like the parents, they seem more real than the eccentric-type parents that often show up in this kind of anime.  I also like the fact that they don&#039;t really design the little sister (Kirino) to be really sexy, and even point out her affection for the imooto-ero games is pure, which makes the anime a lot more comfortable to watch.  I hope its not like Kiss X Sis, that one weirded me out.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d agree with the last reviewer, the series has a lot of potential.

         Most of the really funny stuff was during the end credits, and if that&#039;s any indication of the season, I can&#039;t wait for more.

    As a little sister with an older brother, I was totally against this series the moment I heard about it. Incest in general is just all sorts of wrong, wrong, WRONG. Plus, everything about this anime just screams &quot;hentai doujinshi fodder&quot;.<br />
<br />
Putting that aside, I gave this series a chance because I was attracted by the beautiful animation and cute character designs and I was actually pleasantly surprised. <br />
<br />
Although there are some questionable camera shots of Kirino from Kyosuke&#039;s point of view (for the fanboys, I suppose), their overall relationship remains sibling-like and both characters are thoroughly put off by anything more than that. I&#039;m not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31580">
        sure how this will develop in later episodes/chapters but so far it hasn&#039;t really set off any &quot;creepy/gross!&quot; alarms.<br />
<br />
What I enjoyed most (besides beautiful animation) is the humor. I chuckled at several scenes (I really enjoyed Kyosuke&#039;s &quot;Kick her off the bed!&quot; selection in the eroge game, mostly because that&#039;s what any REAL big brother would choose).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I can&#039;t say this is an anime for everyone, cause there really are some truly crazy creepy people out there that would read way into Kyosuke and Kirino&#039;s relationship...I would advise those people to stay away (please). Otherwise, it&#039;s a heartwarming story about a big brother protecting/supporting his little sis (and who doesn&#039;t just find that adorable, even in real life?).

    NOTE: The anime is called “Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai” or “My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute”. However, it will be referred to as “Oreimo” in this review for convenience.<br />
<br />
The Good:<br />
-Great animation and voice acting<br />
-Not afraid to poke fun at its own stereotypes<br />
-Great cast of colourful characters<br />
<br />
The Bad:<br />
-Great cast doesn’t have enough time in the limelight<br />
-Most of the story progression is only in the first half<br />
-Seems too short for what it sets out to do<br />
<br />
Synopsis:<br />
The plot focuses on 17-year old Kousaka Kyousuke and his 14-year old sister Kirino. As they were growing up, Kyousuke and Kirino’s relationship was pretty much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33628">
        non-existent, and besides occasionally exchanging pleasantries and arguing, they stayed out of each other’s way. One day, Kyousuke discovers a case for a Magical Girl anime called “Stardust Witch Meruru” and wonders where it came from. Upon opening the case, he discovers a DVD for an adult hentai game. He is dumbfounded and has no idea where it came from. He later discovers that both the DVD case and the game belong to Kirino. Later that night, Kirino calls Kyousuke into her room and reveals that she is an otaku and has an extensive collection of anime and adult hentai DVDs that she had been collecting in secret and hiding from her family. However, Kirino struggles with her hobby because she knows how much otaku are looked down upon by society, and so she implores Kyousuke to help her come to terms with her hobby and to help her find friends with similar interests. Kyousuke doesn’t understand much about the hobby or about what’s going on, but he reluctantly agrees to help Kirino.<br />
<br />
The main thing I liked about Oreimo is that is isn’t exaggerated in any way, as far as human interaction goes. It is firmly planted in reality and never tries to stray from it. This doesn’t mean everything that takes place in it takes place every day in real life, however; Kirino’s relationship with her hobby is soon apparent to be somewhat exaggerated, perhaps in an attempt to explain to casual anime viewers that being an otaku is just as much a hobby as any other. On the same token, though Kirino’s hobby is a mainstay in her lifestyle, she is still firmly planted in reality, and even has a job as a model to pay for the games and anime she buys. Kyousuke’s character, I found, is even moreso planted in reality. He doesn’t have a full grasp on his sister’s hobby and the way she acts, and he even shows fear of his sister, only standing up to her in dire situations.  Though Kirino was the one who implored Kyousuke to help her with her struggles, she often implies she doesn’t enjoy his company, even though she consistently forces him to spend time with her. Oreimo is a comedy through and through, and even with that said, it is wholly injected with a  healthy dose of reality.<br />
<br />
There are some things I disliked about Oreimo, however. It is only twelve episodes long. I feel like that really isn’t long enough for the show to do what it sets out to do. There is a twist, however; Episode 12 is only an “alternative” ending. From my understanding, there will be a “true” ending released with the BD/DVD release of the anime. At the time of this writing, it’s not out yet, but I’m sure they will be made available shortly after release. I found this to be a unique twist on an otherwise underwhelming ending, and I’ll definitely be interested in seeing it when released.<br />
<br />
Another thing I disliked is that most of its story progression only happens in the first half of the anime, while not a whole lot happens in the second half other than character interaction. This isn’t always a bad thing; sometimes the story set-up is more than enough to carry the show for the rest of its run. However, I sort of wished the story went a bit farther than it did.<br />
<br />
All of this said, Oreimo is a hilarious take on a very real situation, and it is probably the best anime of the fall. I highly recommend it if you love comedy.<br />
<br />
Final Rating: 9/10<br />

    Most people don&#039;t seem to understand that this is an anime, and therefore isn&#039;t really intending to accurately portray real life. Most critiques I have seen so far of Ore no Imouto are &quot;My friend told me to watch it because he/she said it was really good, but it was just some anime catering to the otakus of the industry&quot;. Reviewer then proceeds to either make fun of otakus, or even more amusing, says why this anime is actually... just an anime! An anime being anime-like? Taboo.<br />
<br />
Ore no Imouto takes a cliche school / slice of life anime setup and sets it at a new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33452">
        angle. Sure, some of the character designs are stereotypical, but they&#039;re all created that way to convey a certain feeling to the audience. That feeling, at least in the anime (because I highly suspect the original was romantic love) is actually sibling or familial love. To break it down for those of you who still think Ore no Imouto is cliche: I don&#039;t know of any other anime that really discusses sibling love in a more mature light than this one.<br />
People complain about Kyousuke being a wimp, and for the most part, he definitely appears to seem like one. However, consider his father, who is actually portrayed somewhat realistically. As a sibling myself, I can clearly see how the iron fist of a father&#039;s control over something that is your favorite hobby could really lead the siblings to come together and make amends for their past.<br />
<br />
Another argument people have against Ore no Imouto is the &quot;girl who loves eroge&quot; cliche/catering to otakus. While it could be seen in this light, I saw it as the stereotypical anime exaggeration that we see everywhere, in order to make an important point. We see Kyousuke fighting for his sister&#039;s rights to appreciate and enjoy her own hobby at her own leisure without being judged by others around her. It&#039;s a wonderful message to send across, despite it being moved by the eroge factor. However, it&#039;s the very fact that Kirino&#039;s hobby is eroge that shows if Kyousuke can justify this hobby to those around him, any hobby can be justified, and in general, any action that does not harm anyone else.<br />
It sends a message to those radically in opposition of hobbies that others have, and a general message of acceptance. Kirino, by the end of the series, seems to be hated by many viewers for what she has done to Kyousuke. Part of that appears to be intentional, as it leaves the audience wondering &quot;How can Kyousuke put up with all of the crap Kirino does to him?&quot; <br />
It&#039;s true, it seems unbelievable, and is highly unlikely in today&#039;s world. But since when has anime ever tried to accurately portray reality? Most of us watch anime because it glorifies simple personalities and relationships between people, transforming them into something wonderful. We watch it because it gives us an escape into a world that we enjoy watching, or may even want to live in, because it is so radically emotionally different than our world. <br />
<br />
It seems that some people are forgetting the magic of anime that led all of us to watch it in the first place. Ore no Imouto is, quite secretively, one of the more poignant animes of Fall 2010, and was a true joy to watch.

    [Please take note that I watched all the 15 episodes of this anime, so this review is based also on those special episodes and on the real ending].<br />
<br />
Otaku activity, like watching anime and especially playing eroges is usually viewed to be a hobby of a young adult males that are a little outcast. Surely, there&#039;s no way that a model middle schooler could do things like that.<br />
<br />
Or is there a way? Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is an anime that tells you a story of a high schooler named Kyousuke Kousaka. His relationship with his sister named Kirino Kousaka is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68433">
        pretty troublesome, and the anime centers around that relationship. I have always liked sister &amp; brother stories, and on top of that the anime also involves a lot of otaku culture in it. Kirino is a top achiever in her school, great athlete and also a model. And, when no one sees, she also plays eroge games and watches anime. One night, she shows her secret to his brother and asks for a life counselling. The idea itself is pretty unique to me, and from the start this anime seemed to be very funny. The story itself is not bad, but what I really liked was the characters, Kirino is a a character that you want to hug tightly, but at the same time you want to beat him to death. It seems like she is your usual tsundere, but I think she is more than that. Kirino&#039;s father is an old fashioned man that has no tolerance for things like eroge. And her mother is your typical kind mother. The only character which I didn&#039;t like that much is, surprisingly, the main character. Kyousuke could have had some balls to stand up against his sister. Their relationship works fine this way also, but I would have wanted to see him getting really mad at Kirino some times.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you put this setting into action, you can&#039;t have a bad anime. Kyousuke&#039;s and Kirino&#039;s relationship is one very interesting thing, It&#039;s like you are waiting for them to either kill each other or commit something that is also illegal at any point. It doesn&#039;t help that Kirino also plays eroges that have the objective of charming your own little sister, the sibling complex is there all the time, kinda lurking in the shadows when Kirino acts all tsundere and I love it. But there&#039;s no way that Kirino would ever look her brother that way right, it would be gross! However, in her games it&#039;s not. At the same time Kyousuke just tries to not give a fuck and just help his sister. When you mix this up with very tight dad that has no understanding for anything like that, you get very comical and enjoyable anime.<br />
<br />
The otaku culture is also very relevant in this anime. Part of this anime deals with problems that one faces when prejudged based on his hobby. You play eroges, so you are a gross human being. This anime really tries to break that and teach you that any thing that brings you such joy and unifies people like that can&#039;t be that bad. At least I saw a meaning like that behind this anime, which is a nice thing. In the end, it&#039;s just a hobby, but all people don&#039;t understand that. That plus Kirino&#039;s and Kyousuke&#039;s relationship really made this anime worthwhile. I must also mention that is was funny to see her playing those eroges, since I have played some myself and all those things that happen in that anime regarding that are very true. Anyone who watches anime can relate himself to this story and feel accepted.<br />
<br />
The ending changes every episode, and there is not even one bad ending there, I liked them all. On top of that, I loved The opening. The art seems to be your normal modern style art, very bright colors that actually do fit very well in this anime.<br />
<br />
This anime was very funny and at the same time very interesting anime that still didn&#039;t forget to convey some kinda message through you. You won&#039;t waste your time watching this.

    IMO, this anime is mediocre at best. People at general seem to like it, but maybe I just don&#039;t see its full potential. I do like the ending.<br />
<br />
Kyosuke, the male lead is a doormat. He suffers from apathy, and who can blame him? Putting with all the shit his little sister does. He is basically a slave to her problems and desires and has none of his own. Yes, he gets some affection - but hell, for all the effort he is putting in that&#039;s insane. We can&#039;t put all the blame on his sister, he is a pushover.<br />
<br />
Kirino, the female lead. I hate her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182920">
        character. She is basically a tsundere on steroids. The entire story revolves around her problems of being a model and a closet otaku and how her &quot;big brother&quot; helps her out. Its not as much helping out as it is pure slavery. She drags him doing shit he doesn&#039;t want, puts responsibility on him to deal with her things.. Nonsense drama. <br />
<br />
Supposedly the anime is great because of how real the interaction between brother/sister are and how they go from step one to uncover their true feelings. That&#039;s all good and that&#039;s the hook of the anime. I don&#039;t like the way Kyosuke acts. He is way too much of a doormat and a pushover and the entire anime is about that. How can an anime be about revealing feelings when the male lead doesn&#039;t take any action or reveal any feelings to the bullshit he is facing? Nonsense drama, that&#039;s how.<br />
<br />
The art is great though. Very well drawn. <br />
<br />
I recommend it and don&#039;t at the same time. But that&#039;s just my view on it. <br />

    I can&#039;t help but feel this show got a little to mainstream for it&#039;s own good, hopefully without descending into a rant this show has evidently been watched by many users who knew full well they had no fondness for this sort of show going into it.<br />
<br />
Ore no Imouto is at times nothing short of brilliant. While not quite up there with shows like Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, when contrasted with more standard efforts like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu this show it truly special. <br />
<br />
Our story follows Kyousuke who inadvertently stumbles across his seemingly perfect younger sister Kirino&#039;s secret obsession with little sister&#039;s (in games

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40231">
        and anime). He reluctantly chooses to support her and they progressively grow closer through Kirino&#039;s hobby.<br />
It&#039;s not the greatest idea for a story, especially straight off the back of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu which had little else going for it bar the novelty of the idea. The premise does serve to give the show an excuse to delve around Otaku culture and scenario&#039;s it would other wise struggle to incorporate into this sort of show.<br />
<br />
Depending on your tolerance and standards there is allot of subtle, or at times not so subtle fan service in this show, the character models are distinct and fantastically realised, the backgrounds are rich and vivid, the whole experience is visually cheerful and vibrant. If you hold this up against pretty much any comedy it&#039;s right up there with the best of them animation wise.<br />
The sound track complements the cheery atmosphere of the show well, i wasn&#039;t overly fond of the dramatic score they used for every dramatic scene, it seemed a little over the top at times. The voice acting was first rate, again distinctive injecting genuine individuality into a first rate cast of characters, production values are something to rave about here, AAA standard all the way.<br />
<br />
The characters for this show are truly exceptional, i&#039;d rate the supporting cast as the best i&#039;ve ever come across in a show bar none, all this considering i didn&#039;t especially like Kirino at any point in the show. Kyousuke can be compared with the Kyon&#039;s and the Tomoya Okazaki&#039;s of anime, exactly the same mold slightly sarcastic darkly likeable male lead. Kirino is loud, bold, spoilt and dominant, not my favourite among the female cast by some distance, but her personality is necessary to drive the story forward. <br />
Supporting cast member&#039;s Ayase, Kanako, Saori, Ruri even Kiriko&#039;s father, are simplly first rate, my only complaint would be they didn&#039;t get more combined screen time, an excellent mix of weird and wonderful characters who often overshadow the leads.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment wise for all my positiveness there were a good few episodes that were genuinely tedious, the episode they spent pitching an anime to studio execs springs to mind fairly quickly. This should not detract from the good 75% of brilliant material, many genuinely laugh out loud moments, a fantastic pacing and energy to the whole experience and a surprisingly good spread of themes, episode styles and character face time.<br />
<br />
Overall it is a crime in my eyes that both the front page reviews score this show to be 1 point above an average show, this was easily among the best shows in what was an especially strong season, and one of the better slice of life comedies you could hope to come across, do not be put off this is one of the easiest watches you will come across.

    I thing I love about anime and manga (though I don&#039;t really read manga) is its ability not to take itself too seriously and the way it pokes fun of the extreme otaku&#039;s especially the grown men who are into magical girl anime. You know who you are!<br />
<br />
Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is a gem of an anime and something a lot of anime fans can relate to as in no one really understands why we watch it.<br />
<br />
The story follows Kyousuke Kousaka, a Mr Average, who doesn&#039;t excel or suck at anything. His little sister Kirano on the other hand is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70389">
        brilliant at everything, school, sports and is even a model. What&#039;s more they don&#039;t get on. However, Kousaka discovers that Kirano has a big secret, she is a hardcore otaku for magical anime and sister love eroge. Despite their differences and not understanding why she is into what she&#039;s into he agrees to keep her secret and helps take her first steps in to otaku culture where they both make new friends.<br />
<br />
In all honesty I began watching Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai with a bit of trepidation after reading the synopsis as I feared the brother and sister would become lovers. I am pleased to say this never materialised. Instead the main aspect of the story is the building of the normal brother and sister relationship of Kousaka and Kirano which they never had before. This is also a harem anime, however, although there are romantic opportunities for Kousaka he is actually despised by one or two of the female characters so we don&#039;t have to endure the usual harem anime jokes. The comedy in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is very good and I did find myself laughing out loud on many occasions.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the many of the characters. Kousaka is a good central character, essentially plays the straight man and being the butt of may of the jokes. He is also a great older brother suffering at the hands of a bratish and stubborn little sister who struggles to appreciate what her brother does for her. Kirano is a character you will like in the end or hate. Her bratish personality is deliberate and essential to the story which makes watching her get over herself all the more better. <br />
<br />
Because Kousaka plays the straight man it enables the other characters to shine. The most interesting of all is the cosplaying Kuroneko who represents the anime fans who watch anime to escape for a while their normal lives. We also find out a little, but just enough to get us interested, of the other characters.<br />
<br />
Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai was never going to be a masterpiece but is an enjoyable and fun comedy yet able to sentimental without being mushing. Well worth watching.

    &quot;This anime can&#039;t be any good!&quot; is what I thought at first, but the name, I mean the context, is absolutely misleading.<br />
<br />
STORY: I have to say, this anime probably slapped alot of people in the face if they expected another run of the mill ecchi, moe, and or even incest anime. Well my face has a big red hand print on it.<br />
<br />
The very beginning shows a cute girl trying to wake her older brother, Kyosuke Kosaka telling him she has done nice gestures like fixing him breakfast, just like another ecchi/harem/moe/whatever else belongs there typical anime, but instead her brother becomes angry saying my sister

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32696">
        is never this nice, you&#039;re a fake, and &quot;My little sister can&#039;t be this cute!&quot;<br />
That was only a dream and that is only like the first one or two minutes of the first episode, and he&#039;s right, I don&#039;t think anyone would think she&#039;s actually that &quot;cute&quot; as I learned as I continued to watch this anime, and I just can&#039;t help but to feel punk&#039;d haha.<br />
<br />
Instead, this is a slice of life anime about Kyosuke and his little, and seemingly perfect in many ways sister, Kirino Kosaka, who is also an otaku (Or what I should say is that she is a closet otaku) who has quite the collection of little sister themed anime and game, mostly inappropriate ones that she keeps them a secret from everyone except Kyosuke who finds out about it (Because apparently up until this point, she was rather good at hiding her hobby from her friends and family).<br />
The story and plot are kinda thin, like most slice of life anime, but it&#039;s about Kyosuke trying to be suportive of Kirino&#039;s hobby as an older brother (The best comparison to their relationship would be how the characters  from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya act towards each other; Kyon and Haruhi), but she proves to be the drama case with the two arguing alot and Kirino almost unbearable attitude towards her brother. <br />
But honestly I believe a lot of anime fans are going to sympathise with Kirino about being an otaku/anime fan and doesn&#039;t want anyone to find out cause she feels that her hobby will damage her image that she has established in her social life and her friends. <br />
While other (Well most) viewers of this anime will just think she&#039;s a terrible excuse of an anime character, but that&#039;s the impression I get from her character. <br />
More characters appear later on, mostly fellow otaku who seemingly are based on sterotype anime fandom personalities, the somewhat gothic tsundere girl who often argues with Kirino, Ruri Goko (aka Kuroneko) and the obvious stereotype otaku looking girl, Saori Makishima.<br />
It&#039;s a very nice paced story that never goes into the incest line that the title almost screams at you<br />
<br />
ANIMATION: Very well animated with excellent character designs, it&#039;s nothing awe inspiring, but it&#039;s much better than most would&#039;ve expected.<br />
<br />
SOUND: The background music is really plain, and sometimes sounds like it belonged from some unremarkable harem/ecchi anime. <br />
The voice acting is pretty good, especially Kyosuke&#039;s Seiyuu, though I can&#039;t really say cause I&#039;m often too busy reading the subtitles. <br />
The opening theme is very catchy pop song, Irony, while the ending theme usually changes in every episode, each one offering okay music.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: <br />
+ A better anime than it&#039;s name suggests<br />
+ Great animation and excellent character designs<br />
+ Doesn&#039;t become a creepy incest anime like the title suggests<br />
- Nothing special audio<br />
- The sister character is easy to hate<br />
<br />
Despite it&#039;s name, this anime is much better than most slice of life anime out there, especially if you were expecting another harem/ecchi/moe/whatever anime.<br />
<br />
SECOND OPINION: (Updated: April 26, 2011)<br />
Looking back on what I said, though it was refreshing, the series has a couple of flaws.<br />
*The main character is sort of an idiotic tool, and has the personality of a blank sheet of paper, my comparison to Kyon (The main male character of the haruhi series) is kinda loose.<br />
*Kirino is actually a little too easy to hate, though the part of her that&#039;s okatu is relate-able, her overall character is annoying as hell.<br />
*The background music is actually worse than what I said it was.<br />
*Not enough development for other characters, especially Saori Makishima, who receives an interesting character twist in the final episodes.<br />
*Despite it not being an incest anime, there&#039;s, unfortunately,  a lot of incest overtones in the anime.<br />
<br />
SECOND OPINION SCORE:<br />
STORY: 7<br />
ART: 8<br />
SOUND: 6<br />
CHARACTER: 6<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9<br />
OVERALL: 7<br />
<br />
It&#039;s still a fun anime, but it&#039;s not as good as I first felt about it.<br />
But I still like it and I would still recommend it to other fans of slice of life anime.
