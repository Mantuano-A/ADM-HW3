    I&#039;ll be honest here. <br />
First things first, the MC is shit. Like, absolute hot garbage.<br />
<br />
This show had a lot of potential to be great. The art&#039;s great, the sound design is well done and the characters look fantastic. <br />
However, the way the characters act, especially the MC, is just unbearable to watch.<br />
<br />
I get that this show is aiming to be a chill anime with wholesome vibes, but the characters are just downright boring and annoying to watch. The MC hardly speaks, and when he does it&#039;s usually just a single word: &quot;Mh!&quot;. See, at first this could be seen as funny or lighthearted, but if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338047">
        he keeps doing it for 4 episodes and contributes absolutely nothing to the show, what&#039;s the point of making him the MC of the show?? I&#039;ve never seen a main character so boring, and contribute so little to a show that otherwise would&#039;ve been fine to watch without him. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the MC is horrible. However, the other characters are about as boring, including the so-called &quot;villains&quot;. The Princess is stupid OP and a glutton, and is always hyper optimistic and cheery. The silver-haired elf girl is extremely earnest and innocent and dedicates her life to this sad excuse of an MC. The catgirl is a tsundere who technically should be a villain but acts nothing like one. I find it very annoying when an anime makes characters that are about as intelligent as a rock. Like when the girl&#039;s sword was initially stolen, her first thought wasn&#039;t to retrieve her sword, but to ensure the thieves got their &quot;medicine&quot;. Like what?? I get she&#039;s supposed to be nice and all, but that&#039;s just next level stupid. And the whole thing with the catgirl trying to kill her... like cmon. It&#039;s so obvious that she&#039;s trying to do something, yet all the characters treat her like she&#039;s their childhood friend. It really feels like I&#039;m losing brain cells whenever I watch the characters interact.<br />
<br />
Oh also, let me talk about the story. Oh wait, nevermind there really isn&#039;t one. In the first 4 episodes that have come out since writing this review, I have no idea what the plot is, and all the villains that have appeared until now have been cliche &quot;bad guys&quot; who have the IQ of a flea. We&#039;re given sneak peeks at some more important looking villains, but so far there&#039;s no information given on why the MC came here, why he&#039;s of any importance, why the princess is getting targeted and why the MC lost his memories. It&#039;s just been a bunch of eating and filler stuff that doesn&#039;t progress the story at all. <br />
<br />
So you may be wondering why I&#039;m still watching this show if I hate it this much. Well, so far I&#039;ve been watching it in hopes of the MC recovering his memories and turning into an actual intellectual being, rather than a guy that responds to everything with &quot;Mh!&quot; and gives a thumbs-up. If he did turn into at least a normal human being that could think, this show could at least be somewhat enjoyable. Since the show keeps emphasizing how he&#039;s lost his memories, I think that implies he&#039;ll be regaining them eventually... and I really hope he develops some sort of personality when that happens. I&#039;ll change the review if that ever happens, but until then, it&#039;s staying as is.<br />
<br />
Update: I&#039;ve now caught up to episode 6, and my opinion of this show hasn&#039;t changed one bit. <br />
In fact, it might&#039;ve gotten worse... The MC is now a confirmed ragdoll of the series, where his only value is being tossed around as a comedic tool. The story has not progressed AT ALL, and the MC has yet to regain his memories. We STILL don&#039;t know who the dream girl from episode 1 is, and why the MC was sent to this world. Like seriously, we&#039;re halfway through this whole show and it still feels like we&#039;re at episode 2 or something. I can only hope this show takes a massive 180 and turns into something actually good, because I&#039;m about ready to drop it.<br />
<br />
Update2: Yeah I caught up to episode 10 so far, it&#039;s bad. <br />

    I’ll be honest here. I don’t like mobile game adaptations. From the top of my head, there hasn’t been a many mobile game adaptation in recent years that I rated more than 5 or above. The reason being is that most of them are bankrupt on the creative side. They seem like projects aimed to make a quick buck. Princess Connect! Re:Dive tells a different story. This particular cute little gem is a mobile adaptation that I’ve grown fondly to actually say it’s enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Right off the bat, I noticed that we have Takomi Kansaki helming the show as the producer. He was previously involved with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346296">
        the popular Konosuba franchise. So in other words, do be prepared for eccentric humor. It depends on how much you’ll approach this show’s humor but to say the least, it has an immense amount of charisma. With our lovable cast of characters, there’s no shortage for entertainment as we follow Yuuki and his adventures. <br />
<br />
However, I will say one thing. Yuuki is the male protagonist but he’s not the one to watch out for, or to invest your time into. Being mostly silent doesn’t help his character nor does it help that he feels like an NPC bot. The real selling point is the character chemistry between the three main female cast – Pecorine, Kokkoro, and Karyl. United under the Gourmet Edifice banner, each of them has their own colorful personalities and it catches on very quickly once you pay close attention. Pecorine is armed with a big appetite and a bubbly personality. She is essentially one of the poster girls and it’s easy to see how friendly she is. A recurring gag in the show also revolves her love for food so prepare to see a lot of cooking at her guild. We are also joined by Kokkoro, a servant who is very loyal to her friends. And while not as energetic as Pecorine, she will draw the audience’s attention with her inner thoughts about herself. Finally, there’s Karyl, the tsundere-like cat girl who seems have her own personal mission to keep an eye on the guild. As the show progresses, her character changes and she begins to trust in her new friends. While the writing here isn’t any dynamic or unique, it does bring her character as someone to appreciate more. Plus, Karyl adds popcorn entertainment to the show whenever others try to befriend her, most noticeably Pecorine. <br />
<br />
Naturally, Princess Connect takes place in a fantasy setting with the show’s various gimmicks. I won’t deny that it can be a bit cartoony at times. It’s adapted from a mobile game after all but don’t let that take away your attention. The show is able to take its gimmicks and bring out the most of it. This is accomplished through the different running gags such as Karyl’s entomophobia, Yuuki being a monster magnet, or Kokkoro’s emotive reactions. Every episode, it uses these little bits of comedic moments in addition to the main storytelling. Make no mistake though. Princess Connect doesn’t have a very serious plot. Sometimes the plot focuses on the adventures while other times can feel like a relaxing slice of life. What’s more fun is how our characters takes their adventures and enjoying the most from it. This isn’t about a group of adventurers trying to save the world or in fact, they don’t really have an endgame goal at all. This show is ambiguous in its main purpose so don’t think too hard into it. Most of the supporting characters also serve some purpose but ultimately, Princess Connect sells itself as a comedy adventure, not some dramatic high fantasy.<br />
<br />
It did became clear to me this series wants to have fun with the cast as much as possible. Remember, it’s directed by Takomi Kansaki so some character personalities in this anime will feel similar to Konosuba. Pecorine for instance has a dumb mentality comparable to Aqua. What makes their characters entertaining really lies in their emotive reactions. Perhaps Karyl is the biggest face to watch whenever she interacts with the main cast or her fear of bugs. Pecorine and Kokkoro also has their own moments due to their personalities. As a mobile game adaptation, the overall art style actually looks polished. From the sunny beaches to the gourmet guild itself, everything looks convincing like it’s in a fantasy world. Even the food has its own unique style that’s made as eye catchy as possible. The weakest link would be Yuuki, our main protagonist. He’s the epitome of ordinary in Princess Connect.<br />
<br />
I decided to watch Princess Connect:Re Dive for one purpose but got exactly that: a simple, fun adventure about a group of goofballs. There’s no complex plot and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out our characters’ personalities. In fact, I do wish more fantasy adventures would be simple as this show. Now are you ready to go on an adventure with Gourmet Edifice?

    This series is beyond adorable I just love it from the characters to the art this series is simply amazing and even though this series isn’t for everyone any fan of this genre will definitely enjoy it OxO<br />
<br />
Story(7):Now back when this anime was announced I didn’t know what to think of it, just another game adaption that I may or may not enjoy but even though the story is simple it’s done very well. This series doesn’t feel like a game adaption to me it feels more like a manga with how the story feels, usually that’s why game adaptations don’t work well sometimes because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337525">
        the story is only suitable for a game but though I haven’t played the games myself (heard great things about it though) this series is simple to understand without feeling confused over things that can only be explained in a game format<br />
<br />
Basically the story is simple a boy is falling from the sky (we figure out later his name is Yuuki) and he is said to be the fabled hero that’s going to save the world and he is greeted by an elf girl said to help him on his journey named Kokoro and she’s best girl, will explain later, and as events happen we meet the others of his party; Peccorine a very dumb but lovable girl with super strong powers and a monstrous appetite, and Karyl a tsundere cat girl with the power to control monsters these idiots join together and make a food guild where they will travel for the most delicious food. Simple but once you seen that anime you can see why it’s enjoyable <br />
<br />
Characters (9): Now I’ve heard some people say they hate ones certain character but I see each character has their own charm. “Main Character” Yuuki is sent to the fantasy world as the hero but in reality he is really dumb because when entering this world he forgot all his memories and not just of himself but instead he can barely talk, hardly can tell what’s food and what’s not and has no strength really of his own, this brings many enjoyable scenes of Yuuki basically being the retarded puppy of the group because he’s useless but you love him anyway and he’s also used for rag doll moments like constantly getting beaten up by funny looking wolves or being eaten by sand monsters or even being dragged away as bait for a dragon...I personally find him hilarious. <br />
Kokoro is best girl simply because she’s adorable and her dedication to Yuuki believing he is a special hero is just precious, she also makes a face that resembles this look OxO and it’s great seeing her be the only sane one in the group.<br />
 Pecorine is wonderful Genki girl with a heart of gold and a bottomless stomach, she’s also got insane powers that make her unbelievably strong so she should be considered the hero but she’s not because she’s to stupid to be a leader of sorts and she’s just of joy to watch.<br />
Karyl the cat girl, she took me and bit to like her but she grows on you with funny she is and how she’s the only one who questions the group on why they are all so stupid even though she kind of is as well, in the beginning she’s set up as a major villain but by episode 3 she becomes part of the gang of food loving idiots <br />
<br />
Art (10): I’m not exaggerating when I say that the animation in this series is breathtaking and is not only consistent but it gives off a feel of Konosuba with all the explosions, character designs are also fun and very creative with everyone having their own colors palettes and they play off each other well <br />
<br />
Sound(7); Personally I love the OP but it’s nothing spectacular except for the animation part of it because it’s seriously very pretty <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10): this series is very fun for me because this series is a very nice mix of wonderful action scenes to wonderful comedy and slice of life, now if you aren’t usually of fan of these series I suggest not checking it out only because I think some Shounen fan boys would rate this series low for stupid reasons as you can tell by the score <br />
<br />
Overall (9): Now I know this series in terms of story is nothing special but I believe that simple stories can work really well if everything else is good and in my opinion it’s really good I don’t know how the rest of the series will go so that’s why I’m not rating it 10/10 yet but in terms of enjoyment this series is 10/10 but I got to see how the rest of the series goes

    Do you like Konosuba? Of course you do, after all everyone had fun looking at the Kazuma troop. If so, Priconne is perfect for you! Welcome to the latest work by Konosuba director Takaomi Kanasaki!<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
Have you ever lost your memory and can&#039;t remember anything? (Hangovers don&#039;t count here...) This is exactly what happened to our main character Yuuki, the poor boy can&#039;t remember anything. A super nice guy, but surely not the most clever one&#039;s and his actions are sometimes socially...you could call it &quot;unacceptable&quot;. With the help of his &quot;servant&quot; Kokkoro, who always speaks to him very politely even in the &quot;master-form&quot;, he finds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346319">
        his way back to the normal everyday life slowly but surely. Together they meet new friends (Pecorine and Karyl) and found the guild with the best name &quot;Gourmet Edifice&quot;, where even Gordon Ramsay would be jealous. Their main activities are finding new gourmet food, a dream of many of us that will come true for them. Besides that, they protect the people in the city from all kinds of danger. They really care about them. On their quest tour they also have to survive the one or the other dangerous adventures. Although there isn&#039;t anywhere a big EXPLOSION, the quests can be really hard sometimes and they have to take care. But luckily their discovered food stays intact even after the fights.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
Each of the characters has their own charm, which is presented beautifully. They are all completely different, but still have a perfect harmony with each other. The close friendship between them can be clearly felt, they have fun and understand each other very well. Everyone of them has a different background story but in the end they still found each other. The troop really belongs together as one unit.<br />
Our main character may not be the smartest at the beginning, but he is very friendly and helpful. No matter if he has the skills to do it, he always tries to save his friends.<br />
His loyal companion and servant Kokkoro always keeps a cool head, she has a very calm and pleasant voice and even when the troops get into trouble, she stays calm and show her fear and apprehension only with her famous OxO expression.<br />
What would life be without good food? Then you would have no strength to do anything. Our always happy Princess Pecorine, who is also a great cook, has this attitude. She is always optimistic and in a good mood, she wants to make new friends and is able to cope even with dark-looking characters. Besides getting along with everyone, she is also a strong fighter and willing to do anything to protect the weaker.<br />
Last but not least, we must not forget the fourth Yuuki-Party member: Our Tsundere Neko Karyl, who has also a few hidden secrets. Nevertheless, it can be said that she feels very comfortable in the group, even if she questions one or the other action of the group.<br />
In addition to these main characters, we also experience many other members from other guilds. They are also very nice and friendly. They help each other and have fun together.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
I have to refer to Konosuba again. At first sight, it immediately gives you that feeling. The beautiful landscape, the really cute characters, all animations are nice to look at. It is a festival of colors, many bright colors are used, which create a very pleasant feeling. The colorful and beautiful nature as it should be is presented here for us!<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
Although the music and lyrics do not highlight any special things, it is simply fun to listen to. The OP gives you the feeling that an adventure is coming, get prepared for it. Meanwhile, the ED music fits perfectly for resting after a hard long day. Get yourself an after work beer and make yourself comfy. You probably know the ED song of the first season of Konosuba &quot;Chiisana Boukensha&quot;, if you enjoyed this relaxed music, you will definitely love this one as well.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
I had a lot of fun watching Konosuba back then, so Princonne got directly my attention. There are so many parallels, you can see the similarities between those two. Just sit back, relax and watch our gourmet troop. Although I am not a big fan of action stuff, I even enjoyed the fight scenes here. The main part is comedy of course and this was very well brought over. Although I have no idea about the game itself, it was a lot of fun for me watching it.<br />
<br />
In the end I recommend this anime to everyone. Just have fun and enjoy it!

    In a nutshell <br />
The series takes place in an unknown world. Yuuki is awakened by a mysterious Goddess only to find out that he is sent in another world to uncover the truth and return his memory. What secret is hidden from Yuuki and will he manage to return his memory? <br />
<br />
Cliché Storyline That Works<br />
Truth be told, after seeing President, It&#039;s Time for Battle! this season, anything connected with a game adaptation would be enough to make me moody, but, as a fan of Cygames, I just could not miss any of their adaptations. You might think that this synopsis sounds way too familiar and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346288">
        you will be right to think so. I did my little research on the game and it does sound somewhat interesting, I must say. The main genre of the series, as I see it, is comedy. Of course, seeing nothing but comedy would be boring, so the show also has something to offer the viewer. What I am trying to say is that the protagonist has an aim to return his memory and there is a reason why he should do that; this is what this series is about.  It is worth mentioning that when making a comedy, there should be a balance in everything. Making something the viewers will find funny requires one hell of an amazing talent and this series is quite funny and it also has a story to tell. <br />
<br />
Eye Candy You Want to Never End<br />
Art wise, Cygames is famous for its amazing visuals. Action scenes look amazing and it is quite difficult to comprehend that what you are watching is not an action, but mainly a comedy centered anime. There are not that many characters, but they look so beautiful: their eyes, every small feature about them, their clothes and just everything looks very cool. This is the pure definition of an eye candy. <br />
<br />
OST Many Series Will Be Jealous Of<br />
Sound wise, I do not know what to say. The OST is great, it is so enjoyable that you never want it to end. It helps the viewer appreciate the series even more and dive into the world of Princess Connect! Re:Dive. In addition to this, the voice actors also did a great job, voicing their characters.  <br />
<br />
Likable Characters<br />
Character wise, you have the male protagonist Yuuki. He does not remember anything to the point that he does not understand such concepts as money; he is like a child that does not know anything about the world. But one thing is obvious, he is very kind. Kokkoro is the devoted Yuuki’s servant. She believes in her God and her task as her God’s servant is to assist Yuuki in every way possible. The problem is, however, she is as inexperienced as Yuuki and it always involves comedy. And there is also Pecorine. She is the best part of the show. With the strength of the Gods and the appetite of a glutton, she is a very likable character. <br />
<br />
Criticism<br />
Princess Connect! Re: Dive is a comedy, do not think about it as some serious isekai, this might be the reason for you to hate the series. And as a comedy this series is quite good and sometimes makes you go LOL. I had so much fun, watching this series. What is more, it has an amazing OST and great animation. What more would you need?<br />
<br />
All in all, highly recommended for all Konosuba fans. While I do admit that this anime is not on Konosuba level, but it is quite an amazing comedy that is sometimes so random. On top of that, there is a story, it makes sense, the visuals are amazing, as well as the OST. This is how you advertise a game, after seeing such a great series, I will surely check the game. Great work, Cygames!

    Oh well, finally a GOOD game adaptation, made by the one and only Takaomi Kanasaki of KonoSuba fame. If there&#039;s anything good about this now-famous mangaka, is that he can turn anything into a KonoSuba-like world, and Princess Connect Re:Dive, based on Cygames&#039;s repertoire of mobile games that are always a wholesome time to get invested into.<br />
<br />
To tell of a trivia on how this anime adaptation went through (if I remembered it somewhere in my memories): There was a time last year when the master comedy director himself wanted a KonoSuba-ish stylized fantasy world, whilst adding all the bells and whistles of what was left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346293">
        out of KonoSuba into a new entity (after finishing the work for the anime and movie), and the opportunity presented itself when Cygames offered to make anime adaptation of this game in their in-house studio CygamesPictures, and he took it by chance to make it Isekai-like (but thankfully within the confines of KonoSuba), and both directed and scripted this show that&#039;s in my opinion, close-but-not-close much to said series, but in its own unique way that stands out a lot to ooze its own charm.<br />
<br />
Reading the story synopsis though, I&#039;d bet anyone who&#039;ve watched KonoSuba be like: &quot;Hey, doesn&#039;t this sound all too familiar? *proceeds to check the person directing this* Yeah, it&#039;s that one guy who made KonoSuba a masterpiece comedy!&quot;, and you&#039;d be right....with a few exceptions. Yuuki the main &quot;protagonist&quot; isn&#039;t like Kazuma, the shallow, bird-brained and altruistic kind against someone who knows the &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; right from the start, and before you ask, YES, both boys have to find out the answers on their own, whilst others giving out parts of it in their own sweet time. Instead of being street-smart like Kazuma, Yuuki is that cliché dumb person who doesn&#039;t talk, and when he does, becomes a parrot instead. But the most important aspect: if he is the &quot;Hero&quot; to save the world, then &quot;save the world&quot; he must take full responsibility for. I can see some criticism for this character, but to be perfectly honest, his character I can dig for the fundamental dynamics of the show in all circumstances.<br />
<br />
Along the way, the characters to meet-and-greet the residing protagonist:<br />
Elf Kokkoro (or as catgirl Karyl would nickname her Koro-ster), for her simple charm of being thoughtful and caring like a mother would be to a wandering and lost child. Her dedication to Yuuki is simply unmatched to see him be a hero, and always that OxO face that gets me each and everytime.<br />
Pecorine the bubbly, energetic and enthusiastically OP girl, who knows no bounds at anything, eating, her magical powers, you name it, she has it all as the Jack of all trades. She&#039;s like Megumin, only more constricted to her abilities and plays wagers at almost everything to keep everything afloat in good spirits.<br />
Cat girl Karyl (who came from the Dark Side), she&#039;s a plain tsundere once you get used to her character, but she didn&#039;t start out that way. Being mentally disturbed and controlled by her &quot;Master&quot; as a tool to spy on Yuuki, she soon gets bamboozled in the actions of Pecorine, Kokkoro and Yuuki, and eventually joins their group of shenanigans. Altogether, these 4 people of 1 chad and 3 best waifus make up the Gourmet Guild, because the only plot in this show is to keep filling your stomach, non-stop.<br />
<br />
And not to mention, the other characters that make their cameos in the anime from the game itself, that&#039;s always a treat for the players of the game to exacerbate some excitement from the hardcore fans.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not hard to say that I&#039;m a massive fan of Cygames&#039;s style of games, especially at the start of their mobile game adaptations (with P.A. Works&#039; Uma Musume: Pretty Derby, and the OK-ish Manaria Friends). And I&#039;d have to say, Princess Connect Re:Dive really shines the best when done at the company&#039;s in-house studio CygamesPictures, which are just plain nice, very vibrant and the best of all, the action scenes that are full of constant sakuga that never stops me drooling at how the visuals and artwork are really just well done throughout. Expecting more from Cygames and their mobile game adaptations done majestically.<br />
<br />
Even more, is the music, the impressive performances of the seiyuus and such: M.A.O for Pecorine, Miku Itou for Kokkoro and Rika Tachibana for Karyl. The OP is already a heartwarming banger in my book, and for a fun fact: it was actually released last year as part of an AMV (with sneak peaks on the anime when it was still in the works), which when I always go back to listen to the great song and basking in the great visuals, makes for a great throwback. Sad that the planned ED is different from the anime, but whatever, I&#039;ll take it for what it is for such a pleasant end.<br />
<br />
Overall, this was more than what I was expecting of a good anime adaptation based off a mobile game, this thoroughly exceeded my expectations a lot to throw my brain off and just watch a not-so-KonoSuba-ish in the flesh show that anyone can still enjoy to the fullest.<br />
<br />
Impressive work. One of the dark horses of the season if you&#039;d ask me. Total recommendation, that&#039;s for sure!

    My English is not so good so please bear with me. First thing first, this is a list, my personal list of anime, so it won&#039;t be like an objective review but more like my personal notes for this particular anime. And since mal require scores to write review then please if you read this for a arbitration refer to this standard, scores to enjoyment.<br />
(3): Makes me bored(sometimes I just forget the series)<br />
(5): Normal(I just remember its weekly release)<br />
(7): Its unique/Its enjoyable(Usually the one that I watch weekly)<br />
(9): I love it(I&#039;m waiting its weekly release)<br />
Why no 0 and 10? Well 0 is reserve for series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338136">
        that I drop even early or the one that I don&#039;t like, while 10 is for those rare series that I can re-watch many times.<br />
<br />
First I don&#039;t play the game this anime is based on nor I know it before so I&#039;m not a fan or something like that. This based on first 3 episodes. Okay so the story begin with a boy, he just wakes up in some space I guess with Ameth that says she can&#039;t guide him anymore because she need to be repaired first and instead sends another person to guide him, Ameth also hint that there is something wrong or there is a lie in the world and its like the boy is the one that supposed to solved it. Then she sends the boy to the world/land. Then we follow the one who will guide him which is Kokkoro and learn that Ameth is some sort of divine beings because Kokkoro is sent by her village elder according to oracle from Lady Ameth. We also learn the boy name is Yuuki after Kokkoro meet him, Yuuki is also doesn&#039;t remember anything like who he is or where he is or even what is money. They go to the capital city Landosol and later meet Pecorine which is very highly a princess and she is very strong like OP af, oh and Kokkoro is like a support role in game but with a lance so she can fight in close range but mainly use long range magic/support. Later we learn that Yuuki has some sort of OP buffing power which Kokkoro said its a Princess Knight, he still can&#039;t really fight thought. The 3 then meet another girl named Kyaru and she is likely want to assassinate Pecorine by her master&#039;s order, but later her master said to postponed it and say to observe her instead. The 4 of them then form a Gourmet Guild and begin their adventure.<br />
<br />
Okay as you can see the world setting is game-like fantasy and no the story is not dark. Yeah right, its not isekai, its our old beloved vanilla fantasy genre(yeay). Okay so what I love from this series is that this is something a good series should be which is not trying to be something else, it just it, its already it. From the start it settled to be not so serious, its relaxing, adorable and cute. The thing is, its not completely adorable and cute like those CGDCT where the story is there in last 2 or 3 episodes like for example Endroll, because the story is still somewhat relevant(later Yuuki remember a piece of his memories where its like some of his friends/comrades/party which all girls died while fighting something and of course the foreshadowing of more girls that seems like already know him in this world/land, oh and also Kyaru&#039;s master&#039;s objective).<br />
<br />
Animation is good(as in they animated scenes that should be animated instead of just still frame), art is good its vibrant colour match with its fantasy setting and I do for some odd reason remember KonoSuBa while watching this its like maybe they have the same vibe(but mostly same degree of enjoyment). As like CGDCT show each girls has their unique personality(Kokkoro is high tier waifu material there xd). Sound is good, I can feel the game aspects from the OST, VA is good in a sense they fit each girl&#039;s unique concept, OP ED is, well its not something that I will play repeatedly but its certainly not something that I will skip all the time.<br />
<br />
And yeah its kind of weird because Yuuki is hardly talk, he just &quot;un&quot; most of the time but after first episode(or some times) the realization will come itself that he is not the MC in the story, he is just side character with MC&#039;s power and role xd(I think its called titular).<br />
<br />
Lastly, will I recommend this to other people? Yes I will highly recommend this if you want something that actually good to watch regardless your personal preference.<br />

    I&#039;ve seen a lot of Isekais. I love fantasy, magic and swords. So obviously I had to watch Princess Connect. It even has a high score in MAL.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t understand how this sh*t has a better score than the average isekais. It&#039;s the worst and there is why:<br />
<br />
Story 1/10: Alright, so there is none. it&#039;s a comedy show. It should be but it&#039;s not funny. It might be fun for 8-14 years old kids to be fair. Konosuba is hilarious, Gintama too. But this, the level of the jokes is so low, it feels cringe. How to stop a cute dangerous enemy that everyone in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348546">
        the group think it&#039;s a cute and kind ally ? One of the character will resolve this issue by eating it. The design of the monsters are made to make people laugh because they look retarded, like tongue out, big eyes one rlooking at the opposite at the other etc. It&#039;s very poor written.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10:<br />
Well it&#039;s beautiful, kawaii, full of color. As i said, the monsters looks dumb it really doesnt feel real like in Goblin Slayer or Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. So they don&#039;t look dangerous but weak.<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10:<br />
It&#039;s not really noticeable, it&#039;s ok.<br />
<br />
Character 2/10:<br />
The MC is the worst character ever written. He can&#039;t talk like a normal human being. He&#039;s useless. He&#039;s just OP because he has to since it&#039;s the MC. When I say he&#039;s OP, he doesnt even know. It&#039;s like very cliché. If his friends are in danger, he&#039;ll have the power to protect them. If they are not, he&#039;s weak. It&#039;s supposed to be funny or something. The others characters are not good either. They are very simple-minded. Like, it&#039;s painful to watch. And once again it&#039;s cliché, so they&#039;re going make fun of a cliché personality trait.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10:<br />
It makes me angry. You want to slap the MC, you want to tell them don&#039;t do that, do this instead. Please use your brain and think. Where is your education ? The comedy part is not enjoyable, amusing. You can see the joke coming miles away. To be honest it&#039;s depressing.<br />
<br />
Overall: I want to smash my head into a wall/10.

    This comedy isekai caught me by surprise a bit. I didn&#039;t expect too much from what I read but saw the director from Konosuba is attached to this anime so I gave it a shot. It&#039;s been funny, cheerful, cute, and a few unexpected elements. The animation quality is great along with cute character designs in the usual fantasy world. The male MC comes off to me as a parody of the same boring male MCs. The female characters have distinct personalities and designs. I&#039;m sure some of them will waifus. I think the direction will simply be a fun show with cute anime girls.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337996">
        This fulfills my desire of seeing waifus, gaming aspects and comedy!

    I didn&#039;t go into this show with the highest of hopes. I was bored, and looking for something to watch, and one of my friends recommended this show to me. He said that he was enjoying it, and that it was kind of like Konosuba, so I figured that I&#039;d give it a shot. I&#039;m a pretty big Konosuba fan, and generally trust this friend&#039;s judgment, so I decided to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
After watching the seven episodes that were available at the time of writing, I have come to the following conclusion:<br />
<br />
This show was made for someone; but I am *very much* not that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340846">
        person.<br />
<br />
On the technical front, the show is outstanding. The world is beautiful, everything is bright and colorful, all of the characters look amazing and unique (more on this later), the voice acting is spot-on, and aside from the occasional decision to crank the bloom dial to 11 (which is one of the strangest visual decisions I&#039;ve ever seen, BTW), everything feels right for this world.<br />
<br />
Now on to the story; which unfortunately will take up the majority of my review, because I have the most to say about it:<br />
<br />
tl;dr: It&#039;s a confusing mess.<br />
<br />
Basically, Protag-kun falls out of the sky after having some vague, lofty conversation with some God(?) about something or other (uncover the truth... I can&#039;t join you yet... you have great power..., please rember..., etc.) only for him to fall out of the sky and be a literal infant. Like, he can&#039;t talk in complete sentences, he doesn&#039;t know how to fight, he tries to eat money, and so on. He literally only exists to create problems for the other main characters, and to occasionally activate his AOE buff when he remembers that it exists. <br />
<br />
The other main characters are better, but it isn&#039;t hard to be more competent than a toddler. <br />
<br />
The first one is a white-haired elf named Kokkoro who was sent(?) by the god(?) to help the protag not die (to literally everything). She calls him &quot;My Lord&quot;, and is overall a pretty cute and charming character. Honestly, not much to say about this character. Good enough, as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br />
<br />
Next we meet Pecorine, who is totally not someone important, despite having a crown, a holy sword, and *a literal assassin* after her, definitely isn&#039;t important (so don&#039;t question it, okay?). She&#039;s OP as hell, is a savant at everything, and likes to eat food. Also, she&#039;s possibly stupider that baby-kun, somehow. <br />
<br />
Finally, we get Kyaru. The would-be magical assassin who is conveniently given a chance to join the party without turn-coating her original... Faction? Affiliation? God/religion? (I don&#039;t really know what word to use here). She&#039;s the token tsundere, plays the straight-man to Pecorine (kinda), and is also a catgirl. So that&#039;s cool, I guess.<br />
<br />
These four form a party/guild with the goal of... enjoying... food... together? Huh? Antics ensue... but not really? Kinda? What? Calling anything that happens a &quot;story&quot; or a &quot;plot&quot; may be a stretch, but progression is (theoretically) made, so...<br />
<br />
After about 3 episodes, it became evidently clear to me that I was missing something. Too much in this show either didn&#039;t make sense, or was otherwise brushed off, almost as if it were prior knowledge. Furthermore, almost every side character that we meet, even in passing, seemed to have incredibly detailed, main-character levels of design put into them.<br />
<br />
Then, as I picked up my phone to refresh the logistics timers for Girls Frontline - a waifu-collector gatcha game that I play - it all clicked. Perhaps with my newfound knowledge, I should restart my review.<br />
<br />
PRINCESS CONNECT! RE:DIVE is an anime made for a Japanese-only waifu-collector gatcha game of the same name developed by Cygames. All of the characters from the show are (I assume) are collectible characters in the game, which is why there are so many incredibly detailed characters. The game world and the anime world are (I assume) the same, which is why there are so many assumptions made about the viewer&#039;s knowledge that aren&#039;t explained. The protag in the show is (I assume) supposed to be the protag from the game, which is why he is such a personality-less harem-bait brainlet, and probably why Kokkoro calls him &quot;My Lord&quot; (read: Commander/Summoner/Doctor/Admiral).<br />
<br />
When you view the show through this lens, I can easily imagine myself giving this show an 8, 9, or even a perfect 10/10... had I been a fan of the game. Again: from a technical standpoint, it&#039;s really great, and the characters could be pretty interesting if I knew their actual backgrounds or personalities.<br />
<br />
I have not, however, played the game - and consequently - I don&#039;t *really* have a complete idea of what is going on, I don&#039;t *really* understand these characters, I don&#039;t *really* understand this world, and I have a feeling that none of that is going change as this show goes on.<br />
<br />
Maybe I&#039;ll keep watching, maybe I won&#039;t; and if things change, I&#039;ll be the first one to be here singing this show&#039;s praises. Somehow, however, I don&#039;t think that that will be the case.<br />
<br />
edit: In retrospect, It seems that I was TOLD about the fact that it was based on a gatcha game, and that I was just too drunk to process this fact. Oops. My criticism still stands.

    I was hesitant to watch it because it was related to a mobile game (I don&#039;t know much about) but I gave it a shot because it seemed to be an isekai(?) and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoy watching it.<br />
<br />
There is a general plot line to the show that is somewhat briefly introduced but it isn&#039;t heavily focused and so far (4 episodes in). There have been tiny pieces added on to the main story but it still seems to be a bit directionless. I think this could be one of the main turn offs for some people who are looking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338080">
        for a show with a focused story progression. <br />
<br />
Another problem some people seem to have with the show is that the MC is too dumb/boring.<br />
I for one, extremely enjoy the MC because of how derpy he is. I haven&#039;t watched many animes with &quot;dumb&quot; MC characters, so this show is pretty refreshing for me. The way he acts and thinks is cute and especially funny when he interacts with his environment/other characters. I guess he is boring in the sense that he lacks a purpose or drive and instead he is just floating around in life (seems like he lost his memories, episode 1).<br />
<br />
Another thing I noticed that may be a problem for some people is that the MC is a bit like a side character because the other main characters are more active than he is. However I think the show does this tetra dynamic so well since all the main characters have a completely unique personality compared to one another and the way they interact with each other is like the characters in Konosuba but way more wholesome and nice. Speaking on of Konosuba, apparently the show shares the same director so their influence can be spotted with the art and comedy. <br />
<br />
The shows visuals I think are excellent. It displays vibrant and a colorful atmosphere. I especially love the way that the grass and water is animated (so satisfying to look at!)<br />
<br />
Overall, I would describe this anime (so far) as a &quot;cute fantasy slice of life comedy&quot; <br />
<br />

    The art is incredible, but like the last show this studio made, the story and character writing is just... bland and awful<br />
<br />
The entire show feels like I&#039;m watching a playthrough of only side  missions in FF XV<br />
<br />
The first two episodes were introducing new characters, but they took the entirety of episode 3 to do a filler episode about.. eating buggs?<br />
<br />
Now episode 4 is about a lamma or donkey or something<br />
<br />
idk, I guess I was just hoping for a good story to go along with the fun vibe the show has around it, but nothing has actually progressed-story wise, and no real end goal has

    6.84 score? seriously guys? there are many other junk anime with harem, fanservices,ecchi with classic overpowered guy character who always save the day and loved by all the girls. Those type of anime at least got a 7 and you give this anime lower than that? i dont get it.<br />
<br />
For those of you expecting for a good laugh and just watch an anime with a chill vibe, you gonna love this. For those who are expecting this anime to have a good fighting scene with a overpowered main character and harem, well you better drop this from the start cause it will disappoint you. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340496">
        really loved comedy anime, at first i thought this gonna be some other poorly made classic RPG style anime but i was totally wrong this anime is really funny, it has good jokes and it is more than just cute girl doing cute things, there is slice of life moments, friendships and these girl are really doing silly funny things, it has deeper story than just cute girl doing cute things. The main character isnt some douchebag with power and surrounded by his harem, he is just some kid that forgets everything and cant do anything right, thats what makes it even funnier.

    As a person who&#039;ve never played Princess Connect! Re:Dive. I think that this anime was actually pretty good. <br />
<br />
All in all, it feels just like a CGDCT fantasy where characters simply go around, do quests, eat and have fun. I&#039;ve seen a lot of reviews saying that they hate the male protagonist but I don&#039;t see anything wrong with it. For me, he resembles a player. He gives off the aura of a low level player who simply boosts his princesses ( works like FGO Master enhancing their servants ) hence his presence was not even necessary. He&#039;s just there for the sake of it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346476">
        To make the show more comical, perhaps relatable(?) and more entertaining. It&#039;s also not even a harem so if you&#039;re overly offended about a male being in a group of girls then don&#039;t worry. <br />
<br />
Very good. I enjoyed this a lot. I&#039;m even considering switching from FGO to Princess Connect. Well. Haha. We&#039;ll see about that. It all depends on my x10 summon roll today.

    So this is my first review so there could be things ill do wrong.<br />
<br />
Story (7)<br />
So this is kind of an Isekai anime and not an isekai anime at the same time. Our mc came from another world or so i belive but the story is for the beginning not that focused on the main character. which is kinda unusual. The story is now not the unordinariest thing but the fact that our mc doesnt have his memeory, i think could be a interessting point in a few episodes. But even if they dont focus onour mc we see in few scence a little part of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337909">
        our mains memory.<br />
(oh boi this review is already bad)<br />
Maybe im not speaking for everyone but the fact that not every single character is after our main is such a good thing for me.<br />
<br />
Art (10)<br />
Ive seen so many animes with good art but losing so much qualities afterwards or in between but now at episode 4 the quality is still so good. Plus its not like in for example Violet Evergarden but every Frame is so cute and beautiful. The colors are vibrant and not boring which is a blessing for my eyes. And not just the characters but also backgrounds are detailed and good. Its a shame that this anime isnt as i know not that popular.<br />
Also usually you can always see whats going to move and what is not and was a little bit messy in my eyes but i didnt see many thinks like that.<br />
<br />
Sound (9)<br />
So im not a specialist in this catergory but i think the Quality of this anime is good. Also the Voices are so cute.<br />
<br />
Character (9)<br />
the character are so individually good. They arent boring they all have such cute character designs. You can see all their personalities in the design. well maybe ecxept the main. Also not everyone but they all have interesting backstories.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10)<br />
they are funny which is one point why i think this anime is great. Sometimes if they get serious in a fight they are so fuuny. You can always laugh in this anime. the Punchlines arent too sudden. There are some jokes that repeat like kokkoros face when our mc is just defeadet in the first scene in the fight (its cute and so hilarious)<br />
<br />
Overall(8)<br />
overall its an anime ill watch definitly again bc its funny but i dont think ill say its an 9. Maybe because the mc still hasnt been a important roll in the story like losing his memory and talking about (which is why i started watching it to know why this happend)

    Princess Connect! Re:Dive (2020)<br />
<br />
For a show again based off a game it really stayed true and conformed to its base. <br />
One thing that may confuse people is why the groups are so abundant and that is based on the game having a 5 member party limit generally. This is why it is understandable that guilds are so small. Some do affiliate to expand, however. <br />
<br />
The show itself is pretty damn good overall and brings a nice story and a great finale. It is also an absolute dream world, what could be better than such a world full of so many girls and for the most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346324">
        part, they are all cute beyond belief. What an abundance. <br />
<br />
For this moment I will just say for me Eriko the fiend girl is my absolute waifu of the show. Let me have her for real. <br />
<br />
The story is let down until you understand the situation by the male protagonist Yuuki due to his memory loss. It later gets explained but it doesn&#039;t if I am honest to make him any better. For the most part, his being there could have been totally ignored. <br />
<br />
The art of the show is very Konosuba reminiscent due to it being from the same place pretty much and it is a high standard of goofy animation that is wonderful for the show. Magic, explosions and cute girls are all done to such a high standard. <br />
<br />
Characters come to a large collection and they are pretty much all very interesting. <br />
<br />
Yuuki, as explained, is very dull and lets the show down a bit. The exception to the interesting, I am sure he will be interesting should we see his full story. Also ep11 come on man don&#039;t be scared of best girl Eriko. <br />
<br />
Pecorine a fallen princess that is explained why in the show is very much an eater due to her accessories. <br />
<br />
Kokkoro an elf girl sent to look after Yuuki as her lord is extremely loyal and cute. <br />
<br />
Karyu a CAT GIRL who is wonderful and a TSUNDERE making her a pretty amazing character. She is very cute too in her actions. <br />
<br />
Aoi who is a lone elf girl generally is extremely cute in her search to make friends.<br />
<br />
Eriko my favourite from the fiend race is an obsessive girl (Yandere) but one that you would do what you need for her. The KuKuKu noise she makes is amazing. <br />
<br />
For the others, we have everything from lolis to girls dressed as animals like a cow all the way to beast girls and girl beasts. (Girl beast you will understand with one specific character) You get so much choice that everyone should be able to find someone. <br />
<br />
I would say from start to finish the show is very enjoyable. On one specific note in the finale, we see a user of transmutation that is always nice since it is much cooler than people let it sound usually. One thing I would love to have seen more of is Eriko but that is me since I could have an entire spin-off series with her. <br />
<br />
Like said the only let down is how they progress Yuuki which is a shame and it drops the show down.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, we get a second season. <br />
<br />
9/10.

    If anime was made in a factory, Princess Connect is the kind of product that would roll off the assembly line. The show is well presented and packaged very nicely, it has some excellent visuals, character designs and some flashy moments here and there to draw you in, but if you strip away the surface then you&#039;re left with something quite bland. <br />
<br />
Princess Connect is entering into the saturated market of fantasy-comedy anime without trying to do anything new. The plot and the comedy are all a bit safe, repetitive and dull. There&#039;s only so many times a stomach can rumble at an inopportune time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341098">
        before the joke is no longer amusing. There is zero plot or interesting character moments, and instead they seem to be placing all their bets on minor, episodic, comedic skits. Unfortunately the especially weak &quot;comedy&quot; and lack of good characters or plot to fall back on, result in a bland and boring show. The characters are designed well and everything is pretty to look at but no one is particularly interesting to watch. <br />
<br />
If anime was conceptualized at a corporate level using graphs and spreadsheets, by men and women with no interest in the art-form - they might ask for; a comedy anime, in a fantasy setting, with a conveyor belt of forgettable waifu bait each episode. Throw in some cat-ears, some meme-able faces and a handful of overused character archetypes. They would then pass it down the line, and their factory would churn it out. It would be efficient, inoffensive and pass quality control, but there would be no heart in it. And that&#039;s kind of what we have here.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a real shame. The animation is great and there&#039;s obviously some very talented animators that have worked on Princess Connect. I wanted to enjoy this one, even as some harmless seasonal fluff. Unfortunately, everything else is all too boring and predictable. The comedy is often repetitive and falls flat, and the overall experience isn&#039;t at all enjoyable.

    This anime is a hidden gem! It has the same vibe as Konosuba I terms of comedy and story telling. The art is great each environment feels fleshed out and really repersents the beauty of nature. The characters are pretty well written, the MC while not really a character acts as a running gag throughout the anime being a braindead bestboy. Pecorrine is adorably stupid getting her top 10 in waifus this season and kokkoro does a great strightman. Kyaru is a great tsundere too. The ost help with the atmosphere of the anime the opening and ending are ok not great but not bad.

    As a once avid player of the game, I was initially disillusioned when I heard that an anime adaptation was announced. The mobage itself employs the use of animated cutscenes frequently and is advertised heavily as being so. With the game being incredibly long as it is with a tedious and ultimately boring storyline to boot, I was expecting the worst when it came to this. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, the show adapts nearly nothing from the actual mobage. With the director of Konosuba at its helm, Priconne is honestly more of a spiritual successor of sorts to Konosuba, albeit less focused overall. The show is practically anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346318">
        original with only the characters and some vague character traits lifted from the original source material. Even the isekai aspect goes entirely unmentioned throughout the duration of the show, as the show provides a fine slice of life comedy every week.<br />
<br />
One of the things that surprised me about the show is how funny it can actually be. The comedy is well written in this, and while not the most high-brow or sophisticated work out there, it still never fails to make me laugh every week (barring the final episode, but I&#039;ll go into that later). While you may think the character bloat may diminish a lot of the scenes, the fact that only so few of their traits made it in, they practically become flanderized versions of themselves and ironically it contributes more to their likability and adds heavily to each scene&#039;s comedic value. And by flanderization, I really mean it. Kishi-kun for instance becomes a complete utter fool incapable of even basic social interactions, while Kyaru&#039;s tsundere traits are bumped up to max leading to her going hammy in almost every scene she&#039;s in. I just love it. Charles and Ikacchi really are the MVP of the show though, and I love all of their appearances the most. <br />
<br />
The plot is paper thin and hardly resembles the mobage it&#039;s based on, but even then it&#039;s pretty shallow and weak. The whole series concludes just as the plot is about to get interesting, and without a sequel being announced, it does add to the feeling of emptiness. That said I&#039;d be remiss to say if the plot was any good. Which it most certainly isn&#039;t. Priconne excels at being a slice of life comedy, its attempts at seriousness comes across as total schlock. It&#039;s laughable at best, but frustrating and tedious at its worst (ie the final episode which provides almost no joy). <br />
<br />
Still despite this, Priconne was an absolute joy to sit through and I was deeply entertained each week by its presence. Even finding Ayumi hidden in each episode was a fun treat. <br />
<br />
7/10

    How the hell is this show below 7 points? Did COVID-19 make all MAL reviewers into SUPER-EDGE-LORD-69-WHO-CANNOT-HANDLE-NON-OP-MC?<br />
<br />
First thing first: Just sheer quality of this show puts this at least at 7.<br />
For those who have not watched it, PLEASE do give it a try.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll try to summarize few points:<br />
1. Characters start somewhat &quot;extremely&quot; stereotypical. Like, the author really tried to do this. MC is extremely useless, and I mean this quite literally; he is basically a mannequin. Should this turn you off? No; I would say he is uniquely useless, unlike those wimpy OP kids. The girls in this anime are all extreme in their personality

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343597">
        as well. They aren&#039;t quite &#039;human-like&#039; qualities, but still feel organic none-the-less. <br />
2. Great animation and overall quality in general. What else can I say?<br />
3. Unique comedy style that will immediately remind you of Konosuba. And reasonably so, since we have a same director here. This could be a pro or a con depending on your taste in comedy.<br />
4. Story is quite painfully slow, but it seems like the main focus of the anime is in character dynamics and slice-of-life comedy. The world is very slowly revealed.<br />
5. If you played any sort of Visual Novel or such &quot;waifu game&quot; you can probably see that each of the female leads in this anime are very &#039;moe-fied&#039;. Each female characters are very adorable (in non-sexual way), but just like the comedy part, this could be a pro or a con depending on your taste.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: This is a more moe-fied version of Konosuba without Kazuma. Comedy is there, but less lewdness and more adorableness. If you are looking for an MC with strong charisma, this isn&#039;t it. But I would say he is a funny vegetable.
