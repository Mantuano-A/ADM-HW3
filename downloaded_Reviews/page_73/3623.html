       At first, I was trying to find some mediocre romance comedy harem anime, which can give me tons of boobs and laugh for example, Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao or Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica to name a few. I mean it&#039;s Christmas now, and I am still single, watching anime at home. All by myself.......... I needed anime to comfort me. :(<br />
Anyway, I then came across this oddly under rated anime Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate :3<br />

   At first glance, the plot might be one of your normal, slice of life school anime. I first thought so too, but then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175035">
        the 1st ep just cracks me up. I won&#039;t go into those spoiler details but I can say, I immediately got hooked by this anime. At that moment I knew that this is my destined one. I give HUGE credits to anime which can piqued my interest this much right in the first episode, only a few could do this to me. eg. Sakurasou.<br />
  <br />
   Anyway, this anime is based on a VN, and from the past few years anime adopted from VN hadn&#039;t been satisfying. I wouldn&#039;t say its bad, but a lot of them are rushed or just focused on the wrong heroine - for example: Angel Beats, I mean I love AB a lot, I cried watching its last few eps too, but overall it just felt a bit rushed. It left a lot of things unexplained i guess.  <br />
   <br />
   However, I believe this is adaptation had done an excellent job.I think it had a pretty steady pace. At least, I didn&#039;t feel its rushed, like AB does. So, I think it did a great job here. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
   Well, here the good part. We have a very diverse and intriguing character casts here. They all have different personalities and motives and such that it didn&#039;t feel like they are cardboard cut out characters or at least most of them.<br />
    I mean we have have 2 oppai girls ( Shinonome Satsuki, Shinonome, Hazuki)<br />
    A super kawaii pentako (Michiru Morishita)<br />
    A bit annoying tsundere, childhood friend girl (Sumiyoshi  Chisato)<br />
    A kouhai full of feels (Aomi Isara)<br />
    At last, but not least the ultimate, always cumming yaoi kouhai (Yumeshima Oboro) &quot;Senpai, I want your stick!&quot;<br />
    <br />
    With these characters, I bet you&#039;re gonna have a lot of fun watching this anime. The reason why I love this anime is because of its diverse characters. The interaction between the characters intricately weaved out the whole story. Most of the characters have been explained properly, and have pretty well development. Moreover, it totally didn&#039;t feel as confusing as Angel Beats were (in the last few episodes :/ ) . Everything nice and good.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
    Well, I don&#039;t have much to say about Koichoco&#039;s art. The animation was fluent and clear, nothing super fancy extravagant like Fate Zero or Kara No Kyoukai, but I was satisfied with it. It&#039;s got a bright colour and overall gave a cheerful atmosphere. It kinda feel like Amagami SS i guess..... <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
    I am not much of a soundtrack guy, so I will keep it short.<br />
    Sound is good. Voice-acting good too. OP &amp; ED good good. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment+Overall:<br />
   After watching Koichoco, it lifted my mood a lot and I really really enjoyed it, I don&#039;t know why it is so under-rated but I think it should rank higher and more people should be watching this. <br />
   I recommend this to anyone who are looking for a good romance, comedy. And I promise, you&#039;re gonna laugh so much in the first ep (at least, I did)<br />
   I think you guys to give this a shot, you might be surprised. :)<br />
<br />
I hope this review helped you and that you guys would like Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate :3<br />

    Hey, you ever been to a party and noticed that there is all the food you want in the world but somehow, some way it just doesn&#039;t satisfy you? That&#039;s sort of the same feeling I got when I finished watching this series. No, I don&#039;t mean it in a way that is unsatisfying. I mean it as the series missing something. Like the chocolate is missing an ingredient or the series itself is lacking something. However, Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate does have some of its good flavors. So, let&#039;s break this down, shall we?<br />
<br />
Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate/Koichoco (also known as Love, Election,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73555">
        and Chocolate) is an anime series produced by AIC Build (Haganai, Oremio) and directed by Tōru Kitahata. The anime is also based off an adult visual novel developed by Sprite. Now what a minute. Did I see the word “adult” in that statement? One might expect some ecchi or or specifically, “adult scenes” in this series, right? Well, not all the case because  in the anime world today, censorship and limitations holds this series at its limit. <br />
<br />
Judging by the title of the series, it can be quite easy to predict what the anime may be about especially the given three parts. First, we got the four letter forbidden word: love. From there, one can imply that the series will have romance. And you&#039;re right because Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate does have that especially between the main male and female protagonist in the series. The second part, election consists of what the drama takes place at the school in the series. Election is for leadership, to lead a student body, and more importantly to represent themselves. Finally, we have the chocolate. Beyond the sweets and flavor, the chocolate here seem to symbolize the sweetness of life. It is every moment of  life that the students at the academy enjoy with their friends and the memories they create to make their lives worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate takes place at the setting of Takafuji Private Academy, a rather large school composed of over 6000 students. Within these group of students is the Food Research Club (Shokken) and here we are introduced the main protagonist, Yuki Ojima of the series. The club doesn&#039;t do much during their everyday boring lives till the shocking news of that their club will be abolished. Anyone hearing that sort of news definitely wouldn&#039;t be happy. Well, the FRC definitely has a few things to say about that. As such, Ojima takes the election of the title and runs for president.<br />
<br />
Now, Yuki Ojima seems to be the type of guy who is lazy and avoids doing work. It&#039;s bothersome for him and like some of us, tries to procrastinate and put things off as long as possible. His childhood friend, Chisato is there for him though and the two duo makes a strange couple of sorts in the series. The problem here is that these two seems to have a weak chemistry at first. They don&#039;t seem to connect and neither do their personalities match. It seems that Yuki is more compatible with some of the other characters, well almost anyone except that guy with the yaoi stick. I mean, that&#039;s just not right. But all jokes aside, Chisato and Yuki starts off the series in a bizarre way. With the election coming up, it&#039;s time to kill that laziness and say hello to some responsibility. <br />
<br />
Being part of a large school also means allies, friends, and rivals. Satsuki seems to serve as the sort of antithesis in the series who not only play as Yuki&#039;s main opponent in the election, but also sort of his outer image. She is like the vanilla flavor of a chocolate and becomes an obstacle of the FRC.<br />
<br />
The story itself have a lot of drama in them. From the very beginning, there is a head and run and later on follows a similar fashion. And of course, election is all about drama especially for those who can win the favors from the students at the academy. It is strange though that in this series, the drama depicted often shifts to different focuses. It intertwines drama between the characters or personal relationships occasionally but at other times, focuses on the topic of elections. Employing this style of story is risky but thankfully in this series, it works out somewhat well. Drama is never easy to employ and with an academy of over 6000 students, just imagine all the possibilities.<br />
<br />
The artwork of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is pretty generic to say the least. There is a lot of stereotypes here including Hazuki oniisama who is portrayed as an older woman with tits and the bossy attitude. The school setting itself is also normal despite its large size. The outer settings are those of at typical school in the modern ages and nothing special about that. In fact, the series doesn&#039;t take place at much elsewhere besides school. After all, school is where love, elections, and drama are born. On the characters&#039; design side, there seems to be some similarities between this series and Amagami SS; even the drama is there.<br />
<br />
As for the music, the series employs a rather soft melody of school like tunes. It employs both soft rhythm (during calm and comedic scenes) to more dramatic music during scenes that are more emotional. It does mixes in well though and some might even give some credit to Elements Garden, the folks responsible for orchestrating the themes. The OP song, &quot;Signal Graph&quot; by Annabel is orchestrated peacefully but also with feeling that depicts the drama in the series. The montage of characters are shown in sequences and even little bits of drama between Yuki x Chisato and what&#039;s to come later. Don&#039;t forget the election part though as that&#039;s what keeps the drama in within the series. The ED song &quot;Kaze no Naka no Primrose&quot; by Ceui follows a similar fashion and presents that school like feeling courtesy of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate.<br />
<br />
This series is actually not bad and has plenty of interesting points. The elections are one of the major themes and throughout the series focuses on it quite well with minimal fillers. Even when the fillers are present occasionally (that are usually short), they still stick with the overall drama theme and how people develop relationships, form bonds, and overcome obstacles together. Like the large cast of school, there is a large cast of characters who each (although some less than others) get their own little spotlights. The oniisama Hazuki, the competitive Satsuki, the black haired loli Michiru, the hyper genius Non-chan, and even that guy with the yaoi stick all get their little moments in. It&#039;s amusing and in some ways wants us to be there with them to join the fun and help with the election wars. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, this series is peculiar. In one way, it&#039;s generic and so predictable of the eventual outcome. In another, it is entertaining to watch with all the characters and the drama going around at the huge academy. Just imagine yourself there and trying to become a leader of a student body of that magnitude. It would be like a living hell to handle that sort of responsibility. Despite this though, the series does adapt well and presents drama at its finest with both the elections and personal relationships. The music and artwork focuses on the typical school life and that each day we get by is another day to learn about the world around us. The content of the story has little fillers so it can all be watchable at once in a marathon for those who are fans into that sort of thing. <br />
<br />
Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is a series to enjoy like an extra curricular activity and not stress over yourself of the eventual outcome. School is filled with drama so loosen up a bit as elections are not never easy. To enjoy this series at your fullest isn&#039;t easy either but just look at it like a drama play. <br />

    Tthis anime is very much like it&#039;s in the respect that it doesn&#039;t make any sense whatsoever. The plot is broken and feels  rushed to say the least. The score is lackluster and the characters are little more than boring stereotypes. Almost  everything about this show screams &#039;average&#039;. To be honest, I would&#039;ve been happy if it was indeed average. But i was terribly disappointed.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with Senkyo is it&#039;s setting. it is simply put, laughable. Students control EVERYTHING in Takafuji Academy from staff appointment to budget management. in fact, there is no sane adult to be seen during the course of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75727">
        the entire anime. It really is preposterous to even assume that 17 year olds have the requisite knowledge to manage a large educational institution. As if this were not enough, the politics surrounding the student council elections is grossly exaggerated. Backstabbing, scheming and attempted murder are what this show considers &#039;real politics&#039;. Wait a minute, did the writers forget that the story is set in a high school? <br />
<br />
The plot doesn&#039;t do anything to ameliorate the boneheadedness of the setting . in fact there is almost nothing apart from the dull politicking to the plot. of course, it is dull because it isn&#039;t done right. We don&#039;t see Oojima making  valid points to support his cause, instead we see him giving supposedly inspirational speeches while forgettable music plays  in the background. To be fair to the anime, it is worth mentioning that it does bring to the fore serious issues such as student harassment. But it doesn&#039;t go anywhere with it. No solutions are provided to the problems the show points out. I&#039;m inclined to believe that the writers never even tried to come with any solutions. This is because the show turns into  a lame thriller around the 10th episode. It seems as if all the drama was placed there just so that the anime could avoid discussing the more serious issues that it had brought up.<br />
<br />
Most of Senkyo&#039;s characters are boring one-dimensional stereotypes of the worst sort. There are several females surrounding the protagonist as is to be expected from a harem. But only two of them are worth writing in any detail about. Chisato, the childhood friend is probably one of the most self-centered,  whiny and psychologically unstable females in anime I&#039;ve had the misfortune to witness. Unfortunately, she is the main heroine of the show. It really is a shame because Satsuki, Chisato&#039;s competitor and Oojima&#039;s political rival is so much better than her in every conceivable way. Satsuki&#039;s back-story although cliched, is incomparably better than chisato&#039;s, which is laughable to say the least. Speaking of back stories, did I mention that they are the only form of character development there is? And to be absolutely honest, these little splashes of character development feel quite prefunctory and often have no bearing on the plot whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The art, animation, ost and voicework are all pretty average. Nothing much to write about here.<br />
<br />
Some people might excuse the myriad flaws of this horrendously blighted excuse for an anime due to the fact that it is a mainstream harem. But there are a lot of mainstream anime out there with a more cohesive plot and better fanservice.<br />
<br />

    Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate.<br />
<br />
The story of a boy yearning for true love and a girl hating chocolate.<br />
<br />
When I first caught a glimpse of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate, I was deeply intrigued by its title. Love and chocolate are all very well in anime nowadays, but elections? Seriously, how could anyone spin a good yarn out of an election?<br />
<br />
Due to me having limited time, and also because there were many other anime titles seemingly worthy of my time and attention, I initially put KoiChoco on my on-hold list. However, as the pretenders faded away from my attention, I decided to give KoiChoco a try,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80556">
        to see whether the anime could possibly be good enough to expound upon the dark, deep world of politics, yet be able to maintain the audience&#039;s attention over the span of a 1-cour show.<br />
<br />
The premise that the anime offers us is an interesting one. There are few anime which can delve into politics and still come away with a decent fanbase. However, I can confidently say that KoiChoco succeeds well in that aspect.<br />
<br />
Let me begin with our protagonist, Oojima Yuuki. He&#039;s not exactly the type of perfect person everyone loves to hate, yet he also isn&#039;t the whiny loser that has recently become a common occurrence in anime. In other words, one word can describe Yuuki. Decidedly average. He has a childhood friend, Sumiyoshi Chisato, who is the president of the Food Research Club, of which he is a member of. He goes to the prestigious Takafuji Academy, where the student body is responsible for autonomy, but slacks off with his fellow members of the Food Research Club and Chisato, spending their free time in the club room enjoying snacks rather than getting involved in any useful activities. Heck, the entire club is so laid back that even their advisor gets into the act, guzzling beer whenever she has a chance to sneak into the club room.<br />
<br />
Yuuki&#039;s comfortable school life with the FRC could have continued interminably until their eventual graduation, but no. Fate conspires to throw them the prospect of dealing with the disbandment of the FRC. A radical candidate, and the overwhelming favourite for the school council presidency announces her intention to disband clubs that do not carry out any activities that could be deemed useful. At first, the future looks bleak for our FRC members.<br />
<br />
That is, until someone manages to come up with a brilliant yet outrageous idea. Yuuki should run for the student council presidency himself! Rather than waiting to be crushed by the iron fist of the school council president, the members of the FRC proactively decide to support Yuuki&#039;s campaign and try their best to prevent the FRC&#039;s disbandment. However, Yuuki&#039;s campaign team face a mountain of difficulties. Yuuki practically has no acquaintances outside the FRC which he can rely upon, he does not have any political manifesto, ideologies or affiliations and has absolutely no ambition or desire to become one of the leaders of the school council. And here&#039;s the ultimate clincher. Yuuki isn&#039;t even willing to run for the post himself!<br />
<br />
Enough of that. If I write any more I&#039;ll be revealing the whole plot of the anime. We don&#039;t want to spoil people that have yet to watch KoiChoco!<br />
<br />
Rating this anime is kind of tough, as it is a jumble of concepts that are so radically different as to be almost irreconcilable. One would be forgiven for thinking that KoiChoco is an anime series that tries the impossible and fails miserably in the process, leaving the viewer with a bitter taste. However, I can guarantee that the story is actually quite well presented and executed throughout the anime. The premise of an election is surprisingly excellently done, with a set of rules governing the election that are actually feasible instead of a load of claptrap, and the show manages to convey the suspenseful atmosphere of an election to the audience very well. An added bonus is that KoiChoco is able to do a fantastic presentation of the dark, murky side of elections.  Throw in a couple of well placed plot twists and cliffhangers and you have the framework of KoiChoco. When I finished watching the show, the first thing I thought was &quot;Wow. Elections sure are serious stuff.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nothing is completely flawless though, and KoiChoco is not an exception to the rule. One major mistake that the studio made is trying to convey too many concepts at once without giving a thought for the overall continuity of the anime. One example being the transition between the first and second half of the anime. The first half is completely geared towards the FRC&#039;s preparation for the primary election and their recruitment for help. Smooth sailing so far, up to this point. But after the primaries are over, the anime violently transitions to a romance story, with hardly a mention of the elections that were looming.<br />
This particular fault made the story seem unreal, disconnected; it could have been two different arcs of two different anime, yet is melded and shaped into the form that is KoiChoco. Frankly, I feel the anime would have merited an even higher score if the studio had competently handled this portion of the anime. <br />
<br />
Another problem is the excessive focus on the Yuuki-Chisato pair. The supporting characters are quite the diverse bunch, but they all fade into the background while the limelight shines on Yuuki and Chisato. Essentially, they are there merely to provide support for Yuuki in his election campaign, as they are all pictured doing their bit to help Yuuki win and so prevent disbandment of the FRC. A couple of the supporting cast actually do play an important role in the course of the anime, but those are few and far between. Granted, the anime is a adult visual novel adaptation which focuses on the Chisato arc of the game. Taking into account the time constraints presented by a 1-cour show, it is indeed logical that the studio turn their attentions and energies to one particular arc rather than trying to adapt everything and end up with a half-assed story.<br />
<br />
The artwork in this anime is very solid and excellently done. Given that KoiChoco is a school-oriented anime, we shouldn&#039;t expect dazzling graphics or breathtaking scenes of snow-capped mountains and lush green meadows on par with the likes of 5 Centimetres per Second. For a school setting, the art is comparable to the best, and frankly, there are some scenes that are breathtaking in its own way, such as the bridge in the OP which features prominently throughout the anime.<br />
<br />
The studio certainly deserves some measure of praise for their handling of the  sound portion of the anime. They have got an intuition for the types of music that fit the mood of the anime and are likely to resonate with the viewer, thus enriching the experience even more. For example, when a supporting character is rushing to try and prevent Yuuki from committing a potentially election-ending blunder, the slow piano piece that is played in the background complements the scene and brings out the emotional undertones that are hinted at. On the other hand, the OP of KoiChoco, signal graph, smacks of a plain and generic song. The performance from the singer, Annabel doesn&#039;t improve it any further either. The ED, Kaze no Naka no Primrose by Ceui, makes a better hash of things, as it is deeply emotional in nature and able to touch viewers with its enchantingly beautiful melody. I have been told that my taste in music deviates wildly from the opinions of many, so feel free to disagree with me on this count.<br />
<br />
Oh boy. Next up is the Achilles&#039; heel of KoiChoco, which is sadly its characters. Normally the meat of an anime that complements its story, KoiChoco has let the audience down very badly here, especially considering that it&#039;s a harem story. Among the wild variation of characters, we have among others a chocolate hating girl, a guy that is openly gay for Yuuki (comic relief?), a chibi inventor who seems to have a few screws loose, an undercover spy for the student council and a dude whose face is a henohenomoheji. Well, that isn&#039;t a major problem on its own. The real trouble with the characters of KoiChoco is that it gives its primary focus to the couple of Yuuki and Chisato. As mentioned above, the supporting cast are simply along for the ride with the exception of a couple of them. Moreover, Chisato morphs from a great character in the first half of the anime into a whining crybaby that hankers after Yuuki for no reason other than Yuuki being admitted into hospital for outpatient treatment. She literally refuses to let him out of her grasp, even going so far as to cling on Yuuki in his own home. I understand the logic behind the studio wishing to portray Chisato as being reliant on Yuuki. It&#039;s explained further in the anime. However, I think they could have at least altered the story a bit to prevent Chisato from degrading into such an annoying character. Even if the adaptation were true to the original source material, I feel that this is one example where a measure of artistic licence should be applied in order to prevent the characters from becoming sub-par. The majority of the supporting cast barely get any screen time, and when they appear they&#039;re either doing things to help Yuuki in his election, lazing around the FRC club room or making subtle advances towards Yuuki. There are certainly exceptions to this, but their appearances are relatively sparse compared to Yuuki and Chisato. The lack of organisation in allotting screen time to the various characters becomes a major failing of KoiChoco.<br />
<br />
Well, for all my criticism I have to admit that I enjoyed KoiChoco very much. From the interesting interactions between the characters, the fresh breath of air that was its premise of elections, and the marvellous art and character design, I can honestly say that KoiChoco is an anime that I have enjoyed very much in comparison to the other titles in the industry. Although it certainly does not reach the dizzy heights of some, KoiChoco can certainly hold its own against other generic anime that have flooded the anime market in recent years. Moreover, it offers us a more in-depth view in the world of politics, something which I have never seen in an anime before, excepting the odd student council election that isn&#039;t the main focus of the anime. Since I enjoyed all the aspects of KoiChoco fairly well, I will say that KoiChoco has afforded me great enjoyment, particularly because I retain a certain interest in politics.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, KoiChoco has its share of flaws and failings, however I can safely conclude that it is a decent anime which manages to capture the audience&#039;s attention and hold it through its airing. If you are intrigued by the premise of KoiChoco, I would certainly recommend that you give it a spin. Who knows, you might be amazed by what KoiChoco brings to the table.

    Well this is my first review, so I hope you would be satisfied.Well firstly, this is your typical &#039;&#039;club and student council&#039;&#039; type of anime.The art is well done,very similar to amagami ss.So far the series is going pretty well and yes there&#039;s some romance and a bit of harem here and there,There&#039;s also a dash of comedy which makes it enjoyable.The story itself isn&#039;t unique,since there are some anime with the same concept,of student coucils and clubs.The chocolate-candy concept is kinda new though.Hopefully, this series wouldn&#039;t turn into  your typical &#039;&#039;harem&#039;&#039;.

    A big problem with visual novel adaptations these days is that most of them stick to this formula where nothing really happens, there&#039;s a lot of attempts at humor, they explore each (or most) character(s) and the protagonist picks a girl. Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is different, although it still shares some similarities with most visual novel adaptation, it separates itself by having a pretty interesting plot, which makes the series enjoyable.<br />
<br />
What really makes the plot interesting is the twists and turns that happen along the way. The plot may seem simple at first, the main character trying to win an election to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73753">
        student body president so his club would not be disbanded. But as the series progressed and as they started to give us a deeper look into the election, a number of darker and more serious things start to surface. For a 13 episode series it does a real good job at making an interesting plot because it has depth to it.The series does leave some things unexplained and the series certainly has it&#039;s flaws but given the time frame, Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate executes the story really well.<br />
<br />
The art was nothing too spectacular but it is really well drawn. The animations are very fluent and there&#039;s no major errors.<br />
<br />
The sound was good too, the opening is very lighthearted and has a very happy mood, which fits the series very well. The ending is a very soft song, which has this farewell feel (if that makes any sense at all), very fitting for an ending. The voice acting is also done pretty well as they make the feelings of the characters believable.<br />
<br />
For the short time frame that this anime was given, the series did a fair job with the characters. The main male protagonist Yuuki Oojima is a lot like many main male protagonists in other harems, except he isn&#039;t useless. He doesn&#039;t really get much development but instead he helps the other characters develop. He is also very likeable much like many of the other characters. The girl he ends up with, Chisato Sumiyoshi, is not very well received by others, but personally, I don&#039;t hate her. She goes through some nice development such as finally overcoming the loss of her brother which is more than expected from a series of this length. The supporting characters get little development, some get some development and others aren&#039;t even touched. However they are still all likable and you will almost always be finding yourself rooting for somebody.<br />
<br />
As a whole Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is one of the more enjoyable harems for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons is because it has an interesting plot. Another reason may be because of it&#039;s comedy, which is well-placed at some times but misplaced at others but when the comedy is well-placed, it can be down right hilarious.<br />
<br />
Overall Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is a nice change from many other visual novel adaptations these days because it can be very entertaining. This also shows that not all harem animes are that bad.

    To start of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate looks like your typical slice of life anime where the club is having problems. However, this one is different because it incorporates 3 elements that I feel make it unique or special. The first element that I liked was the drama because on the outside you have the typical slice of life vibe, but once the action gets going especially towards the end that is where drama is released. Dialogue is the second element that makes this Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate different because with having presidential elections one would expect to have a lot of dialogue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136433">
        to present their points or objectives. the third element which is comedy incorporated well since it was kept at a minimal level and mostly done from the side or supporting characters.<br />
<br />
Story: The story was ok, but I feel like it was rushed. There was some parts during the story that just felt ignored or not fully explained. Still what makes the story have a higher score is the drama part because it is nicely done. The last couple of episodes really make up for the lack of drama at first. Comedy wise that didn&#039;t hurt the story, and the characters all brought the story together even more.<br />
<br />
Sound: The OP and ED are very nice and worth watching every time. Not much to say here besides saying that during those serious scenes the background music really enhances the scene even more. The main song that is the highlight of this anime is the song played by one of the characters who use a harmonica.<br />
<br />
Character: The score really doesn&#039;t reflect on most of the characters but rather on some of them. Chisato from my perspective had a very complex personality that helped relate or understand her. Michiru another character is one that I liked the most based on how she behaved. Her appearance really makes her stand out from the rest of the characters because she carries that mysterious presence whenever scene shows her by herself pondering. <br />
<br />
Enjotment/Overall: I sure wish this anime had a second season because some things could be explained better there, and it would be nice to see maybe time skips of how the school is doing as well. Overall I really enjoyed Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate and the ending really helped bring the number up even more. Despite the low passing score that the story has the characters make up for that and really help make the anime worth watching. the comedy also made me burst into laughter at times so that also incorporated into the overall score.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say for those who want to watch an anime that will make you laugh, yet have a serious tone then Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is one to watch. Just be prepared for the moderate dialogue. Other than that I will sure remember this anime and the amazing characters it had. <br />
<br />
Hopefully you all found my review helpful and I hope you all like Koi to Senkyo as well.

    “Nothing ventured nothing gained” That is one of the quotes that came to my mind after starting this anime. The main protagonist Yuuki Oojima has the option to run for an election to save his precious club, he starts his election after hearing similar words from people around him. <br />
<br />
At first I thought Choi to Senkyo to Chocolate would be your typical school club romance type anime. For me it ended up becoming so much more. It starts out with a dramatic event that honestly makes hardly any sense until you get quite a ways into the anime. Once things start to make sense though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73467">
        this anime seems too really shine. One of the things it portrays is that politics aren’t always what they seem on the surface.  There is always a struggle behind the scenes and this is one of the topics this anime tackles in a very interesting fashion. Throughout the anime it confronts the things that happen on the surface and behind the scenes in politics. <br />
<br />
Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate also has the drama and romance to go with it that makes it all the more intriguing. Each character has their own story and their own reasons for doing things. They are all unique and make the story come together wonderfully. <br />
<br />
As for Koi to Senkyo to Chocolates flaws, it definitely does have them, though most are easy to look over. One of it’s biggest flaws I think is that it sometimes feels rushed sometimes. I would have liked to see this anime more around 23 episodes. It also has it’s cliché’s like most anime, things seem to always work out for the better. Oh and they never explain some things like how Oojima seems to see some people in a strange way, though it’s easy to make speculations.<br />
<br />
Overall I was very impressed, especially considering I wasn’t expecting much of anything of this anime. It has all the factors to make it a very enjoyable watch. I also don’t know of many anime’s that present politics and romance in the way this anime does, which made it even more enjoyable.  Either way whether you enjoy drama, romance, or politics this is a good watch!

    Love, Elections, Chocolate.<br />
<br />
On the surface it seems like a typical highschool drama. There&#039;s a boy, he&#039;s part of a club, and that club is going to be disbanded if they don&#039;t do something! When I see a story like this what it comes down to typically is how enjoyable the characters are to watch. Coming into this I knew the anime wasn&#039;t my typical selection: It&#039;s not in the top 1000, and it&#039;s rated 7.4. But I found the anime to be enjoyable overall.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re trying to decide whether or not to give this a try, I&#039;d say be ready to accept a certain amount

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106943">
        of tropes and cliches. I&#039;d say it&#039;s not a masterpiece, it&#039;s not great. It had a lot of flaws. But I found it enjoyable, and it has a happy and romantic ending.<br />
<br />
To begin, this is based off of a visual novel by the same name. As such, it suffers a quite a bit from &quot;all sorts of females are inexplicably in love with the main character&quot; syndome (ironically not so much the club members). It feels very scatter brained because you can tell where there would&#039;ve been multiple routes for different heroines in the visual novel; however these are not pursued in the anime. This leaves the Main Character feeling rather weak and indecisive at times. For the majority of the episodes though you have a slice of life show about a guy trying to get elected, with occasional bits of drama sprinkled in. The plot and drama really heat up in the last stretch of episodes, and this is when the show is at it&#039;s best in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The art/sound were both well done but nothing to be amazed at. They don&#039;t detract from the storytelling, and the music does a good job of setting the mood at the right times (mostly).<br />
<br />
The anime would&#039;ve been better if it had focused on one primary female heroine, and if the main character felt a bit stronger and decisive. It did feel like the story had gaps, it was as if there was too much story to fit into 12 episodes (again, probably because it&#039;s based on a visual novel in which all of this could be explained in more detail). Still, it did something I find few animes doing these days and that&#039;s end happily. And I liked the fact that it didn&#039;t try to spring a new romance into the fray mid way through. Despite the fact that the M.C. feels pretty weak in his convictions (towards potential romantic interests) at times, the anime ended romantically as I think it should&#039;ve. <br />
<br />
Based on enjoyment alone I&#039;d give it a 7, but I think overall I have to go with a 6. I by no means feel like this was a bad show, but you&#039;ve gotta be ready to accept it for what it is: a nice little story about a club trying to get their friend elected president with a little bit of plot to intensify the romance at the end.

    I love chocolate, wtf am I saying? Ok, so this sweet anime has ended and I glad that it becomes a Yuuki X Chisato arc, so let&#039;s get down to business:<br />
<br />
Story: Good 7.<br />
<br />
I say even though the story is a mixed up arc, I like the way where is was going,co&#039;z everything about this anime revolves around love, elections and chocolate. The love part are the occasional arcs where the muchacho (Yuuki) encounters, though it still has that guy is oblivious to girl&#039;s feeling kind of thing. The story kinda misdirects us audience as to whom will the muchacho (Yukki) will end up with, even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73597">
        if the muchacho (Yuuki) has told the chiquita( Chisato) that he&#039;ll never leave her side, we sort of ignore it hoping that it&#039;ll be whom we hope for. Needless to say that the &quot;Love&quot; thingy of this anime&#039;s title refers to Yuuki X Chisato&#039;s arc, in fact the romance genre revolves around it. The &quot;Election&quot; thingy of this anime&#039;s title is more of a  mystery genre that surround the bureaucracy of the student council in particular the &quot; Public Safety Commission&quot;  and the Katahira Faction, and as for the &quot;Chocolate&quot; thingy ( I love chocolate), that is where the drama genre is and it is all about the chiquita&#039;s (Chisato) hatred  of chocolate and Daikin her hermano (brother).<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Ok for the girl&#039;s school uniform, I really can&#039;t dig the illustrator&#039;s idea as to why most students don a 4 layer dress, which btw is the cropped jacket which the 4th layer and worn by most girls and why do some girls only have 3 layered uniform, wtf do I mean? Ok most girls have the follow layer of school uniform which is compose of the following; camisole, shirt, skirt and cropped jacket....btw the ribbon is not included. on the other hand Michiru, Ai Ki, and Isara don a 3 layer uniform, which only includes the camisole, shirt and skirt. If this is the illustrator&#039;s way of distinguishing the freshmen from the older students then that is a a very cheesy concept. I&#039;d rather see them girls wearing an ordinary sailor&#039;s outfit than having to discriminate certain character&#039;s outfit.<br />
<br />
Sound: Good 7.<br />
<br />
I like the both the opening and ending theme, but I mostly prefer the opening theme. Which is titled &quot; Signal Graph&quot; sung by Annabel:<br />
<br />
Signal Graph, English translated:<br />
<br />
My hand can reach you as you stand smiling in front of me.<br />
But although I’m so close to you I can touch you,<br />
<br />
I put up a front and close off my feelings<br />
and pretend I don’t notice the emotions flowing out of my heart.<br />
<br />
But even beyond the cloudy sky blurred by my tears,<br />
the bright blue sky spans across.<br />
“The signal telling me I can change.”<br />
<br />
I’ll raise my hands high up<br />
so take me from the past I feared<br />
and into the future I thought<br />
I’ve let go.<br />
<br />
I just noticed you and that<br />
which shines brightly within you.<br />
I’ll look straight ahead<br />
and walk forward together with you.<br />
<br />
I knocked down one of my dreams I thought I could reach.<br />
And I sat there looking out the window…<br />
<br />
When our eyes meet, I can’t say anything.<br />
So I smile hoping my smile will convey these overflowing feelings.<br />
<br />
Accepting each other is not because of weakness,<br />
so teach me how to have a stronger heart.<br />
“The signal telling me I can change.”<br />
<br />
Speeding up my pace along with yours,<br />
I’ll take the tailwind<br />
and go towards the future I thought I’ve let go<br />
one more time.<br />
<br />
I keep the strength you gave me deep in my heart.<br />
One day I’ll be sure<br />
to shine brightly and shine over<br />
others and the roads they take.<br />
The bright light, gives me a push on my back, and spreads far.<br />
<br />
I’ll raise my hands high up<br />
so take me from the past I feared<br />
and into the future I thought<br />
I’ve let go.<br />
<br />
I just noticed you and that<br />
which shines brightly within you.<br />
Let’s walk forward holding hands.<br />
<br />
“Given enough time, everything will change.”<br />
I won’t ever say that anymore<br />
and go towards the future I thought I’ve let go<br />
one more time.<br />
<br />
Even against the wind raising its speed,<br />
I won’t close nor avert my eyes.<br />
I’ll look straight ahead<br />
and walk forward together with you.<br />
<br />
Walk forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Yuuki Ojima- The thing about him, is that he&#039;s a kind of guy who is aware that the girls have feelings for him, but seems to be of a block head as what to do next, ok so he&#039;s a bit of a Mr. Heroic when he tries to save Isara from being builled and when he also mends Satsuki and Hazuki&#039;s differences. But he kind looks like this soon to be reluctant philandering husband where he searches for love only to find out that his real heart belongs to Chisato.<br />
<br />
Chisato Sumiyoshi- everyone kind get&#039;s irritated when she seemly dominates Yuuki and seem to relies a lot on Yuuki for emotional support. But it is that emotional dependence  that gives her character that dramatic climax.<br />
<br />
Mifuyu Kiba- Well, if you were to ask me, she actually my 2nd choice if ever the Chisato X Yuuki arc didn&#039;t come about, I like the way she has that gentleness about her, but I can never understand as wtf is a big deal about Japanese teenage girls on being insecure about having a scar? When in her case she had it co&#039;z she had underwent surgery, now it is not like that she lost her virginity co&#039;z she was raped or something.<br />
<br />
Isara Aomi- I kind pity her, and I could have wish that she wasn&#039;t being buiiled.<br />
<br />
Michiru Morishita- If only if this anime wasn&#039;t being censored, I would have seen her panty. But I can never understand as to why is she sooo passive and yet sooo deadly. I really hate it that she&#039;s an S-agent though, but she one moe that you&#039;ll find interesting. <br />
<br />
Satsuki Shinonome- Whoa, she one hell of a refine lady with both beauty and brains.<br />
<br />
Nozomi Edagawa- or &#039;Non Chan, ........I have nothing to say.<br />
<br />
Ai Sarue and Kii Monzennaka- I guess if this anime should have a tsundere character, they are it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oboro Yumeshima - Yaoi? EEEEWWWWW! ( No offends to the members of LGBT society)<br />
<br />
 Hazuki Shinonome - What I like about her is that she&#039;s one Milf that everyone will love............to be Yuuki&#039;s cougar that is. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the cast, If there will be a character that best describes as the mystery genre of this anime, then it&#039;ll be Yakumo Mōri and Kana Ōgibashi and as the antagonist it&#039;ll be Moheiji Tatsumi in which I can never understand as to why he has to be in a henohenomoheji-like mask and Yuina Ōsawa. I really find it irritating that teens like them seems to be in control of  Takafuji Academy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and overall: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Well, if one is to enjoy watching this anime, then it is really enjoyable to watch, especially when one is hoping for someone to be Yuuki&#039;s love interest, in which I&#039;m glad that it ended with Chisato. Overall I find it irritating that  Takafuji Academy seems to be controlled by the student council and the student council itself in embroiled in such bureaucracy where such mystery genre  was formed in particular as to who ran over Kana, what anomalies does each commission of the student council is in to and why does the Public Safety welds such authority not only over the students but also with the faculty and the school administration. Such things are ill fitting to the overall of this anime, but it does provide such curiosity as to how things will go about, so it is only limited to have a 7 for its overall score.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love chocolate.  <br />
<br />
<br />

    Love, Elections and Chocolate. I think that&#039;s the textual english translation for this title. And it pretty much sums the whole anime up. That&#039;s it for this review, see you in the next one! :D<br />
<br />
That&#039;s what I would really had liked to say because of the first impression this anime gave me. It has all the elements that make it look like your typical harem - slice of life - high school anime. It even has all of the archetypical characters, and most of them have to be female, of course. However, this anime achieves a lot more than what you might think.<br />
<br />
The setup is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160433">
        a rather large private school, composed of about 9999 (or all of the 9&#039;s you can imagine for a single number) students, and thus, the student council is taken pretty seriously. You could say that the students themselves are the ones who rule this academy. It&#039;s kind of an utopic school, where the democracy has a huge roll and it&#039;s executed perfectly. <br />
<br />
Enter our main character, Yuuki Ojima: A rather lazy student who attends to this school and belongs to the &quot;food research&quot; club that does virtually nothing more than eating. He belongs to it just because there&#039;s something that tells him that he must be in a club, and of course, to be with his childhood friend, Chisato Sumiyoshi.<br />
<br />
As the student council gets serious about clubs literally wasting and throwing money away in order to keep doing nothing, our main characters and the rest of the club decide to protect it, and the only way is that one of them becomes the council student president.<br />
<br />
As our main character becomes more and more popular every time because of the elections, he starts to realize that there&#039;s a lot more to do than saving his own club. He starts to develop selfless-ness, and he becomes some sort of a pro-active guy, caring about what happens around him, leaving his laziness behind. And this is where the well executed drama (specially with his childhood friend, Chisato) begins.<br />
<br />
I never thought I&#039;d say this about an anime, but there&#039;s a honorable mention that I want to give to the comedy aspect. which was not abused nor it was totally absent either. Somehow they put this when the times were right and it helps you release some tension that the story builds up as it progresses. It just comes naturally, and even if you dont think it&#039;s funny, it helps you to recover your pace and catch some air. Alright i&#039;m exaggerating :D <br />
<br />
I give the story a solid 8, as it  has different &quot;areas&quot; where it develops itself, but it does in a pretty convincing fashion, without losing any of its focus. <br />
<br />
I would say 12 episodes weren&#039;t enough, as the development kind of required some more depth to it. However, I think pretty much everything was very well executed plot-wise. Nothing was rushed nor over-extended either. <br />
<br />
<br />
The characters, as I mentiones before, are nothing that blow your imagination away, for they are these archetypical characters. However, the characters&#039; development is notably one of the strong point of this anime. It was really good to see these people not hesitating to take mature decisions to support the ones they care about, as well as leaving some stuff about their regretable past behind. When you start do develop some sort of love/hate relationship with one or more characters, that&#039;s the moment you will know they were well executed and have an impact.<br />
<br />
The art in this anime was ok. it reminded me a lot of Amagami SS, specially on the characters design (although this aspect is a little more exagerated in Koi to Senkyo). Everything was pleasant to see and is well detailed too.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the sound, i found it awesome for an anime of this type. I was really immersed into the general feeel and atmosphere of each scene because of the background music solely. It really invites you to become one with the plot.<br />
<br />
Voice acting was also good enough. Not outstanding, but it was well done for my taste. Emotions were convincing.<br />
<br />
I would say that I enjoyed this wayy much mure than I thought I would, even if the three first episodes were full of &quot;OMFG not this again&quot;. If it catches you from that moment, you will not be able to stop it. Even tho some of the arcs were over the top, it made me experience a lot of empathy towards the characters. I recommend you to give this one a try and see where it takes you :D<br />

    People say &quot;never judge a book by its cover&quot; and I cannot expresses how it is true for this anime when it caught me off guard. Some may think this anime is like any generic and stereotypical anime about schools and how any stereotypical characters interact with each other. Well you&#039;re half right but you are also wrong. This anime is more than that, it doesnt follow the general dogma as some of you might say it and it will drawn you into a world of politics, revenge, violence, discrimination, and dramatizations. If you are into school, comedy, romance and drama, this anime is just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89133">
        for you.<br />
<br />
Art/graphic -  The art is beautiful, all I&#039;d have to say is its better than most anime I&#039;ve seen so far including the more recent ones. Although I do feel that they could have done so much more with the art, I think this amount of work was the right choice for this anime. <br />
<br />
Sound - This one is especially my favorite, I was instantly hooked with the OP as well as the first song in the beginning of episode one. <br />
<br />
Character -  I&#039;m not going to talk about the character because people have different interpretation on what is a good or what is a horrible character.<br />
<br />
Story - This is what really drawn me into this anime. Unlike any other orthodox   short series comedy, romance anime where the plot (or no plot at all) come after 6 or 7 episode of the anime. (I know how frustrating it can be) The plot in this anime immediately present itself after one or two episode. Although this anime have many characters, it seem only to revolved around the main protagonist and his girl. Although this anime have a harem feel to it, it definitely going a different path than what it was meant for. What really makes me loved this anime was that the ending unlike any other thousands of anime, did not have a half ass ending. Im sure many of you have encounter many of these anime where the main character do not end up with anyone or the ending wasnt to your satisfaction. Well, I wont spoil any ending but the main character actually do choose a girl at the end and had over come many obstacle to be able to achieved his goal and love life unlike other protagonist where they are too &quot;pussy&quot; or weak and had to let the girl do everything. <br />
<br />
This anime definitely caught me off guard as I was looking for something enjoyable to watch in my spare time. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9

    One of the most common ailments of VNs-turned-anime is that it&#039;s easy for the romance to overwhelm the story.  Integrating a game with multiple routes with multiple leads into one single storyline often ends with a anime that, at best, seems like a harem anime that lacks the courage to actually make it a harem (Clannad) or, at worst, a mess of routes that fails to flesh out characters well and butchers the plot (i.e. Studio DEEN&#039;s adaptation of Fate/Stay Night).  Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate manages to find a tenuous, if workable balance, between plot and characters in this adaptation of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73073">
        original Eroge.<br />
<br />
=Story: 9=<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the season, Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate started out near the bottom of my priorities list, fulfilling the spot of stereotypical-harem-with-a-plot that just manages to stay good enough to avoid being dropped.  The first episode certainly reinforced it, with a club with seven females and two males, one of whom is also apparently heads-over-heels over the other, the protagonist.  The originally chilling prologue of the first episode seemed to have been completely forgotten, and the whole election was going to be a happy but uninteresting frolick of cuteness and relationships.  However, KoiChoco (Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate is a bit too much of a mouthful) does in fact develop from a harem with a plot. <br />
<br />
 As is the case with apparently all Japanese High Schools, the Student Council holds vasts amounts of power.  In the case of Takafuji Private Academy, an academy whose finances are almost completely managed by the students, the Student Council controls the (as mentioned in Episode 11, &quot;tens of billions of yen-strong&quot;) expenditures of the  school.  The Preisdency usually is fought over by three major factions within the school: the Finance Committee, the General Affairs department and the Public Safety Commission.  With the current incumbent plagued by allegations of corruption, the projected winner, Finance Commissioner Satsuki Shinonome, campaigns on a platform of austerity, starting with the elimination of clubs that do not appear to be doing anything productive with their funding.  Into this is thrown protagonist Oojima (often mistaken as Ooshiima due to the Kanji) Yuki, who is nominated by the members of his club (the Food Research) to run as a third-party candidate in order to save his club, all the while confronting the many interpersonal issues that emerge through the course of the campaign.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, KoiChoco does not neglect the character-side of the story--much of the election (and much of the routes in the VN) are bound to interpersonal relations--the past traumas of Election Manager, Club President and Childhood friend Chisato Sumiyoshi, the family struggles of Finance Commissioner Satsuki Shinonome, the personal struggle of Isara Aomi, a beneficiary of a controversial financial aid program, and the enigmatic motivations of Yuki&#039;s backer and incumbent president, former Public Safety Commissioner Yakumo Mori. However, what makes KoiChoco an exceptional adaptation is its focus also on the main plot.  Through the story, Yuki and the Food Club must confront many of the problems faced by Third Party Candidates in a field dominated by large, well-funded parties, while also delving into the behind-the-scenes politics behind Yuki&#039;s backer, the Public Safety Commission, and the two other commissions.  Sometimes I found that the actual story at times seemed more appealing than the interpersonal struggles of the characters, though the opposite also occurred.  Overall, KoiChoco&#039;s best point was its ability to both bring out the interpersonal interactions of the cast while also maintaining an interesting and absorbing main plot.<br />
<br />
=Art: 7=<br />
<br />
While nothing bad can be said of the art--it is certainly cute, and there are no major drops in animation quality, the art comes off as unexceptional--good but not much different from anything else out there.  The anime frequently uses soft, pastel-like colors that help maintain a warm atmosphere to the anime in general, which does contribute to the atmosphere, but not in any noteworthy way.<br />
<br />
=Sound: 8=<br />
<br />
KoiChoco&#039;s Openings and Endings start out generic, but grow on you very quickly.  Signal Graph, the OP by Annabel, a departure from the generally soft, rather quiet Ending themes the Artist usually does (as in Sankarea, Canaan and Another&#039;s Endings), is an upbeat, enjoyable song that conveys the mood of the anime quite well, while the ED, Kaze no Naka no Primrose by Ceui, is also pleasant, but not quite as noteworthy.  The soundtrack music is certainly good, with a lot of synth, string and piano themes that would be expected of a romantic anime.  While nothing is lacking in the OST, there is nothing that would really come out as exceptional.  <br />
<br />
=Character: 8=<br />
<br />
The main issue with many of the characters in KoiChoco is that they seem underused.  Many of them (Chisato and Yuki&#039;s friend Mifuyu, Michiru, Satsuki), while itneresting and well-fleshed out characters, do not seem to be used to the best extent they could, for the very reason that adapting their whole route into an anime of only twelve episodes would be difficult.  Other characters that probably held much more potential (i.e. the abrasive and strange Moheiji Tatsumi, whose mask apparently only Yuuki can see, Satsuki&#039;s sister and Yuki&#039;s adviser Hazuki, and Aomi) are also left seemingly without much elaboration.  Once again, the limits of a twelve-anime show should be brought into consideration, but the underutilization of some very interesting characters was a bit of a disappointment that reduced the score from 9 to 8.  On the other hand, other characters seemed pointless and unimportant--the cutely generic child genius Non-chan, Ai Sarue and her other-colored-twin Kii Monzennaka all seemed forgettable, with no seeming purpose apart from filling the club with people.  While that, too, should be expected of minor characters, they could have been replaced with less generic characters.<br />
<br />
=Enjoyment: 9=<br />
<br />
For me, KoiChoco was a pleasant surprise in that it simply broke my expectations of a generic harem show and turned out to be a not-quite-riveting but certainly very interesting story that combined both interpersonal relationships with some of the actual politics and pressure behind an election.  The fact that at times my heart did race is certainly enough to elevate it to a 9.<br />
<br />
=Overall: 8=<br />
<br />
KoiChoco should honestly be deserving of a 9 - I really do want to play the Visual Novel now, and its plot probably covered most of the spots that made me dissatisfied with the anime.  The characters were pleasant, the story was excellent, and though the arts and sounds were unexceptional, they were certainly not detrimental to the story.  The only obstacle to getting a 9 in my book would be unavoidable specter of the 12-episode limit, which probably prevented many of the scenes from being employed to their best effect.  Overall, though, I thoroughly enjoyed KoiChoco in its 11-episode run, and look forwards to the last episode.

    Love, Election and Chocolate is pretty much another anime based off a dating sim game with our male lead Yuki being surrounded with several girls he interacts with in his school club. To a good extent, the anime essentially milks the typical cliches and archetypes of dating sims, harems and high school-based anime, which include even a student council that has more authority over school issues than the staff to go along with its &quot;election&quot; premise.<br />
<br />
It does have some refreshing story elements to its dating sim roots. Yuki isn&#039;t made into a hapless lead dealing with unwanted attention from the girls surrounding him as he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177477">
        is a level headed guy trying to get a handle on all the situations surrounding him in the school as he runs for student council president and has clear thoughts on the feelings he has for the girls surrounding him within the club or around the school. While the anime has some fan service and double-entendre moments, they don&#039;t pop up often nor do they get in the way of developments with the show&#039;s plot. The first half also has some potential with its election plot as Yuki tries to gain support for his electoral run and understand the ropes of being a student council leader.<br />
<br />
The series quality starts to degrade in the show&#039;s second half when elements to the show&#039;s dating sim roots start to rear their ugly head. The sub-plot that Yuki is dragged into involving hostilities between two characters got decent focus and genuine drama out of the affair. However, Love Election and Chocolate&#039;s attempts at adding romantic developments in its second half are rather underwhelming as they are rather unconvincing and poorly mixed into the ongoing developments Yuki has with the election. The election bits even degrade in quality as well when things get way too overly serious over the stakes of the election when things such as secret groups, conspiracies and scandals get added to the mix with such students treating the election as if they were trying to win a campaign to run a country. It&#039;s perhaps the poorest example I&#039;ve seen of the &quot;Absurdly Powerful Student Council&quot; trope getting milked from an anime to date.<br />
<br />
Visual quality for this is a bit on the plain side for a 2012 title. There are sharp details and bright colors incorporated for character designs and scenery to compliment the cheerful mood the anime wants to give off. However, nothing with it particularly stuck out in comparison to other impressively visual titles animated from that time such as Eureka Seven AO and Fate/Zero&#039;s second half.<br />
<br />
Much like many other dating sim knockoffs I&#039;ve come across, I&#039;m rather indifferent towards Love, Election and Chocolate. Despite having some decent elements to its premise, the series still mostly milks off story cliches and character archetypes typical of the genre and the election story gets rather ridiculous in its second half when it tries to act like its making a statement about politics. Unless you&#039;re a sap for dating sims, I&#039;d pass on this.

    This series might have some solid stuff. The series is made intellectually pleasing but tries to keep other kind of folks interested too by the usual harem school club setup and it has worked decently though not brilliantly. The art doesn&#039;t help out much in favor of ma king it anymore attractive. The strong points of the series are I think, the characters and the dialogues. The first episode gives the air of an espionage thriller and political feel which has been heavily normalised for a high school setting and how the author uses this theme creatively is to be seen and I would like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65451">
        it to work out well since it seems very interesting and hoping it wont lose its momentum and become just another excuse for a harem. I can draw parallel to the series &quot;Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon&quot; which was just too brilliant in story and style. Considering the fact that there are a lot of double meanings and that it uses a serious topic such as election politics, censoring and that too the just mild ecchi contents is very irritating and counter intuitive.

    Hello guys~ This would be my first MAL review. Please forgive me for any grammatical errors and awkward wordings.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the main reason I&#039;m writing this review is to defend the low rating/low popularity, and to also encourage other anime lovers to enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
The main problems others state for this anime are excessive amount of characters and plot rush. However, I don&#039;t really blame the anime for that. First of all, this anime bases off of Visual Novel, so the amount of characters can&#039;t really be blamed. The plot kind of rushes because of the length of the anime. I believe if the anime has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181431">
        more episodes and focuses more on main characters&#039; past, then the anime can be as emotionally powerful as popular anime such as Clannad and Little Busters. <br />
<br />
-Story- 9/10<br />
The story is really great. The idea of student-governing school is really refreshing. The plot progresses well and the anime does not lack emotionally powerful stories. You would want to watch the next episode after each episode. The political struggles within the student government really interest me. Just as I mentioned above, if the anime has more episodes, this anime can easily get 10/10.<br />
<br />
-Art- 10/10<br />
Really great art. The characters are beautiful and designed well. The setting is really great, so does the environment in the anime.<br />
<br />
-Sound-  10/10<br />
Really love the OP and ED. Soundtracks are not bad as well.<br />
<br />
-Character- 9/10<br />
Characters have different personalities and roles, with different back-stories. The amount of characters is a problem though; however, I don&#039;t really blame the producer for that. The main male lead progresses throughout the anime. The relationship between main male lead and main female lead progresses as well.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment- 10/10<br />
This anime can really move people. The stories are great and the interactions between characters are interesting. <br />
<br />
-Overall- 10/10<br />
Really good one for me. Reminds me of clannad and little busters. I really love these emotionally powerful anime, especially if they revolve around school. I would gladly recommend this anime to anyone who loves Clannad/Little Buster or anyone who loves anime with school, romance, and slice-of-life settings.<br />

    Short version: While not well executed, this series has a unique approach to its story, which is why I do recommend you to watch it despite its low rating. I can&#039;t say whether you&#039;ll enjoy it or not, but it&#039;s worth to see nevertheless.<br />
<br />
One can easily list multiple stories, novels, movies, which portray how elections work (or more precisely, not work). Most of them ironically portray an incompetent, money-driven candidate who running his unfair and corrupted campaign.<br />
Love, Election, Chocolate! portrays Ojima Yuki, a member of the Food Research (a.k.a. Eating) Club, which, of course, gets school funds for its activities. However, the elections for Student

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73509">
        Council president are approaching, and the popular candidate wishes to disband clubs that don&#039;t deserve their funds, including Yuki&#039;s. Not knowing anything about politics and PR, Yuki decides to run against her.<br />
Then what&#039;s the difference, then, between Love, Election, Chocolate! and all the other works you mentioned above? Once again we have an incompetent candidate who&#039;s running for president for money!<br />
Unlike other similar political shows or novels, there&#039;s no irony in LEC! Instead, Yuki is the person who is about to lose the club, which is the place at school he really belongs to, and simply tries to protect it. We are also shown interesting personal dramas of the other members of the Food Club and the opposing candidates, political (and not only) intrigues by the people who currently have power, and much more.<br />
For this unique approach I give the story  8/10 (which is good, coming from me), despite the filler and supposedly comical silly scenes.<br />
The art, however, I didn&#039;t like. While its quality is good, I care a lot more about character designs than the quality of the art. And them didn&#039;t like: strange hairs, big boobs, and a face which looks like a mask. Thus I give 3/10 for the art.<br />
The music was OK. I liked the opening and ending a lot, and the the soundtracks were good and appropriate.<br />
As well as the character designs, the characters themselves also draw the show back. While appropriate (for example, we have Yuki&#039;s opponent, the perfect, honest, fair candidate; we have two comical relief characters), they are nothing special or original.<br />
Characters which are &quot;nothing special&quot;, bad art, fuller scenes, manages, in my case, to &quot;compensate&quot; for the unique approach to the story, and thus I give 5 for enjoyment. Nevertheless, I do recommend you to give a try to this series.<br />
<br />
PS: Could you send me some feedback if you find thid unhelpful?

    Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is one of those anime that you don’t really expect much from but by the time the curtains closed you had gotten more than you bargained for. Don&#039;t you love it when that happens?<br />
<br />
The Short Version:<br />
(+)The art is alright for the time.<br />
(+)The main characters are a bit more tolerable than the normal given the genre.<br />
(-)There’s way too many characters for this show to focus on.<br />
(-)The shift of tone towards the end is so sudden it’s jarring.<br />
(-)The sound, save for one part, is easily missable.<br />
<br />
The Story (6/10): The story is about the main characters trying to stop their club from being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190999">
        disbanded, and they think up that the best way to do this is to have the male lead run for president, because on the day a new president is founded they immediately get to allocate the budget for all the clubs instantly. Because that’s totally how that shit works. One of the things that I really didn’t enjoy with the story is that the first 5 minutes are entirely misleading, then at the end of the show they bring back that tone for some reason. I was so confused towards the last 4 or so episode because the show changes from a light-hearted rom-com thing, to a drama piece that has something to do with political movement for the presidency. That is not a good shift of tone for a show like this, if it kept the feel from the first half of the show I probably would’ve enjoyed this just a bit more.<br />
<br />
The Characters (6/10): I’ll say this quickly about the characters, there’s way too many for a show this small. You want to know why? Because it’s a VN adaptation, that’s why there’s something like 10 characters all in the club room at any given time, 24 characters over the entirety of the show, that’s way too fucking many for a 24 episode show, especially when you’re trying to tell the backstory to one of the main characters but keep cutting back to the side characters because hey, club members are important. Now take everything I just said about the characters and accept it when I say that the main characters aren’t that bad, not as bad as you’d think they’d be for a VN adaptation of a rom-com, speaking of mains.<br />
<br />
Yuuki Oojima: The main guy of the show and the one running for the presidency.<br />
<br />
Satsuki Shinonome: Yuuki’s biggest opponent for the chair and not the biggest asshole of the show.<br />
<br />
Chisato Sumiyoshi: Childhood bestie to Yuuki and the one who is mildly damaged to say the least.<br />
<br />
Michiru Morishita: Let’s say she’s ‘loyal’ to a particular someone and the pandering character.<br />
<br />
There are other characters listed as main on MAL but these are the one’s you’ll be spending most of the show with, and again they’re not as unbearable as you’d think. And don’t even bother getting invested in any of the romance, because it doesn’t get any sort of conclusion.<br />
<br />
The Art &amp; Sound (6/10) &amp; (7/10): Considering this show came out in 2012 the art is pretty standard, everything isn’t eye gougingly bad, but it’s so standard to the point where the only real response I have for it is, “meh.” It’s not bad yet not great either.<br />
<br />
The sound is mostly the same across the board, the voice acting, OST, OP &amp; ED, they’re all fine. “But you rated the sound higher than the art.” Yeah I did, because there’s a scene with a harmonica at the end that’s just so damn good, also the violin was exceptionally good.<br />
<br />
What do you think of this show?<br />
<br />
It’s not necessarily a horrible show, it just trips over itself towards the end.<br />
<br />
Would you recommend this show?<br />
<br />
If you’ve played the VN or want to kill some time yeah, otherwise nah you don’t really need to bother with this.<br />
<br />
Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next.

    **I have only seen the anime of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate and this review is only based on that.<br />
<br />
Romance comedys with high school settings are by far my favorite anime series, so keep that in mind. <br />
<br />
Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate/Love, Election and Chocolate/恋と選挙とチョコレート ; 12 episodes a 20 minutes, aired from July to September 2012 ; Comedy, Drama, SoL, Romance, School ; licensed by Sentai Filmworks <br />
<br />
Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate appears like a generic romance school story who wants to be different from mindless harems, to then develop into a thrilling election battle with very interesting subparts to the main plot. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181238">
        follows the happenings in a student-reigned school where the Studen Council basically reigns it like a small state. <br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
If you have already read the synopsis, you know that the story is something fresh and new. Running for student council president normally is not part of the ideal Anime MC character, so it&#039;s interesting to see something new. Apart from this main plot a big part of the series is also the romances and relationships around the male MC, to an extent that sometimes almost make it seem like youre watching a harem series, but these are minor appearances. It is almost impossible to analyze the story without spoilering it all, but in the end, it fades out to have been a very complex storyline with important and diverse subplots, which make the biggest of the good part of the series. I would have given a 10 if it werent for some unnecessary exaggerations, but its still good. You will never be annoyed or not pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art is nothing special, but good nonetheless. Sentai Filmworks is a good studio and clearly lives up to the expectations. Sadly, I only gave an 8 because of often very unnecessary and out of place fanservice, which mostly just ruined the scene. Nothing to complain about the art though, the girls are diverse and beautiful, animation is well done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The OP isnt generic but still awesome. ED is extremely fitting to the vibe that the episodes emit, well chosen. ANd the background music is just perfect. I have seen few anime whose background sound was just so perfect, especially when there are so many different styles to chose music from, since the story subplots are so different. The voices are mostly very good.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
This anime does not at all have your generic dere-character types. Most characters appear to have so in the beginning though, but then receive decent to great parts of character development which explains their diverse and unique characters to the viewer. The way they act appears very realistic and understandable because of their characters. The life crisis and psychologial problems of the single persons are also well executed. It creates a remaining bond to the viewer which makes this show so good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Coupled with an complex and intriguing story, excellent character portrayal and well executed comedy scenes here and there makes this show extremely enjoyable. After overcoming my post anime depression of binge-finishing this series yesterday I still think its awesome and heavily underrated. Everyone who watches this will be pleased by the diverse storyline and the appealing circumstances. Its worth watching this, believe me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
If it werent for the sometimes out of place scenes - as mentioned before - I would have given this show a 10. It also is while realistic in some aspects, extremely unrealistic in some others. The displayal of childhood love, post-traumatic problems, teamwork and even touching important aspects of modern definition of democratic state systems, the show makes a staying impact on the viewer. This all coupled with good comedy really made this show for me.<br />
<br />
Forecast: There wont be a second season, since the story is more or less finished. There were some OVA&#039;s that add a lot to the romance and battling over Oujima&#039;s love, plus a whole bunch of fanservice - if youre a fan of that, go ahead and watch them.<br />
<br />
**This is my second review, so please keep that in mind. If you have any suggestions or feedback PLEASE tell me so I can improve my reviews. I plan on writing one for every finished anime from now on, and I want em to be good. Thanks for reading!!

    Story:<br />
The story of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate was pretty good until about the eleventh episode. It was funny, there was a little bit of romance, some drama between the main character Oojima and his childhood friend Chisato whose brother died at a young age.<br />
But at the eleventh episode things started to get way out of hand, it turned unrealistic and melodramatic, and I kind of sat there with a &quot;WTF&quot; face.<br />
Other than that it has a great story :)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Fantstic art, I loved everything about the art. The outfits were cool and I love how they draws the faces. The eyes remind of the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75437">
        from Tsuritama and I think that&#039;s really cool.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The opening theme is very pretty and matches the anime well, it&#039;s sort of peaceful like something you would fall asleep to, but at the same time it&#039;s kind of fast-paced.<br />
<br />
The ending is great as well.<br />
<br />
As for the character voices, they did a fantastic job on voices matching the characters, unlike some other animes I&#039;ve watched where they are completely off.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
I think Oojima is awesome, he is fair, kind, and overall a nice guy.<br />
<br />
Chisato on the other hand is sometimes whiny and confusing. I liked her a bunch, but sometimes I just wanted her to shut up and stop complaining and being so clingy.<br />
<br />
Another character, the last President at the highschool almost never opens his eyes. And usually in animes like Gin in Bleach or Lao from Kuroshitsuji, I don&#039;t mind and it matches their character, but for some reason every time I saw this characer it really made me mad that he always kept his eyes closed apart from a couple of occasions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Other than the big melodramatic climax where I was seriously wondering why it was so dramatic when it was only highschool, I enjoyed it very much. Especially the green haired club memeber, Yume, who was a great comedic relief from all the drama and always tried to get with Oojima and made &#039;Yaoi Sticks.&#039;<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Even with the pretty strange storyline and dramatic scenes that shouldn&#039;t have been so dramatic and some unexplained envents, this anime was pretty cute and if you&#039;re a fan of harem or romance animes you should watch it.<br />
<br />
