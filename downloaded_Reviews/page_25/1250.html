    This is my first anime review.<br />
<br />
Inazuma eleven is based in a game series by Level-5.<br />
<br />
I liked the Story, is a great plot with a big variety of characters and unrealistic attacks. But... it has some differences respect the version of the original game.<br />
 <br />
The art is great, especially in the shoots and attacks.<br />
<br />
The Sound is composed for Yasunori Mitsuda, he did a good job in this, and sound effects are awesome.<br />
<br />
I really loved this anime beacuse is really emotional in occasions and others funny or many more. <br />
Inazuma Eleven values the meaning of friendship and teamwork.<br />

    I started to watch Inazuma Eleven out of pure boredom and ended up with a total obsession. You don&#039;t have to be a soccer fan to like it (to tell the truth I really dislike soccer ...) or to have an understanding of it. <br />
<br />
The story was, well, surprising. It is a bit unrealistic to use soccer for world domination or try to kill kids because of soccer but it is an anime - it doesn&#039;t have to be realistic. At first, I was really annoyed by seeing soccer-playing aliens (2nd arc) who destroyed Japanese high schools like they couldn&#039;t use their power for more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36059">
        profitable purposes. Of course this made no sense at all on the first glance, but in the end it was surprisingly well resolved. <br />
<br />
Besides the story is only secondary. Inazuma Eleven focuses on the characters, which are unique and well designed. There is a character development and even though there are a lot of characters the show managed to balance quantity and quality. Everyone has his own story and his own problems to overcome. I really loved this show because of its characters and would give it 20 out of 10 points if it would be possible.<br />

    I recently had the pleasure of watching Inazuma Eleven for a third time and I can safely say it is still as evergreen and exciting as I found it the first and the second time I watched it. <br />
<br />
Presented by Oriental Light &amp; Magic, the studio that gave us Pokemon, Inazuma Eleven has been a huge success in Japan and several other countries and it has good reasons for so. <br />
The story is centered around a young and energetic football freak, Endou Mamoru, who is trying to gather members for the local school football team; The Raimon Junior High. With his charismatic personality and never-giving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191995">
        up spirit, Endou with the help of a few soccer buddies manages to find eleven players to play for the club and to aim for the Football Frontier Tournament. Football Frontier is a competition where all the junior high schools across the nation participate in order to achieve the number one position in the whole country. But before they could even participate in the tournament, they are pit against the famous Teikoku Academy, which is currently the best in the nation and have been winning the tournament for 40 successive years. Things do not go as planned however for Raimon as they are completely overpowered by Teikoku in all departments of the game. Shoot after shoot, goals after goals Raimon players get battered brutally with an overwhelming margin of 20 goals to nil as Endou Mamoru could only watch his friends lying helplessly not able to stand across the field. As everything seems over before it began for Raimon, an unexpected twist occurs as Gouenji Shuuya, the talented striker who swept away all his opponents single-handedly in the previous Football Frontier Tournament while still just being a freshman, takes the field wearing a Raimon unifrom. It seems that Teikoku was waiting all along for him to take the field and as he does an inspired Endou Mamoru catches the ball cleanly hit by Teikoku and throws it straight at Gouenji who then with this amazing shoot makes the goal. Teikoku then abandon the game as they got what they had come for, and thus resulting in a victory for Raimon Junior High. This is the beginning of the adventures that await Raimon and Endou Mamoru in his future. <br />
<br />
The are three different arcs in the show - The Football Frontier arc, The Aliea Academy arc and the Football Frontier International arc. <br />
<br />
(i) Football Frontier arc: Follows the journey of Raimon Junior High as they take on the local school teams to enter the competition and play against the best of the nation and their journey to the top.<br />
<br />
(ii) Aliea Academy arc: Follows quickly after the Football Frontier Final against Zeus Academy as various schools across the nations including Raimon Junior High is destroyed supposedly by &quot;Aliens&quot; who say to come from the far planet of Aliea as the messengers of Aliea Academy. They use a Soccer battle as the means to conquer the Earth. There are five teams in Aliea Academy; Gemini Storm, the second rank team that are the first to arrive. Epsilon (Also play as Epsilon Remastered in the later episodes), the first rank team and the rest are Diamond Dust, Prominence and Genesis which is led by Hiroto, are the three master rank teams.<br />
<br />
(iii) Football Frontier International arc: Begins after the victory of Raimon against the Aliea Academy&#039;s Genesis and players around the country are gathered to form the Inazuma Japan which is the national team of Japan. The arc follows their journey as they progress through the Asian preliminaries and face the teams from all over the world.<br />
<br />
The characters play a pivotal role in the series as is the case in every anime, and each of them have their own unique personality and appeal. <br />
<br />
Gouenji Shuuya: The cool-headed striker with great potential and also known as &quot;The Flame Striker.&quot;<br />
Endou Mamoru: The Goalkeeper and the protagonist of the series. He is also the Captain of Raimon Junior High. <br />
Kidou Yuuto: The brains and the genius strategist of the field. He previously was the Captain of the Teikoku Academy but now is an irreplaceble addition to Raimon Junior High. <br />
<br />
These are just the main three characters of the team and there is the rest of the team as well consisting of Kazemaru, Someoka, Handa, Max, Kabeyama, Shourin along with several other members that join Raimon in the future. <br />
<br />
Endou Daisuke is the grandfather and a former soccer player-cum-goalkeeper for the Japan National team and it is he whom Endou looks upon as an inspiration and decides to be a goalkeeper himself.<br />
<br />
Kageyama Reiji is the main antagonist of the show. Kageyama&#039;s father was once hailed as the future of Japanese football and that is before when a group of exceptionally talented players gathered by Endou Daisuke overpower him and he is descended into darkness. This leaves a huge mark on a then young Kageyama as he grows deep hatred for soccer in his heart and vows to use any shrewd means possible to take his revenge and to sit on top of the soccer world. He is the owner of the Teikoku Academy and is mostly called as &quot;Commander&quot; by Kidou Yuuto and the rest of his players. It was him that taught Kidou his soccer and made him grow up to be a prodigy. However the sense of self-righteouness earned by playing against Endou and his friends, Kidou vows to leave Teikoku and follow the right path and to play his own soccer. It&#039;s pretty ironic actually that the villain whom you will hate for the most of the show then turns good later in the show in what was an absolutely heart-wrenching episode to say the least. I could not hold back my tears at that point and most likely you won&#039;t be as well. <br />
<br />
The sound aspect of Inazuma Eleven is one of its strongest assets. The soundtracks used between the episodes are brilliant and it won&#039;t be an exaggeration for me to say that Inazuma Eleven has one of the best set of soundtracks in anime. Furthermore, it also boasts of six top-class openings performed by T-Pistonz + KMC. Two of my favorite top 5 anime openings are from the show. They&#039;re simply classic. The ending themes vary from person to person as they&#039;re all aimed differently for both boys and girls. The voice acting again in this anime is top-notch. A lot of budget was put into this and it clearly verifies it by the class of the voice actors. Each of them is a pro and and you&#039;re most likely to find them in any other anime you see. One of the main example is the voice of Endou, which is the same voice actor popular in his role for Naruto in the Naruto franchise. <br />
<br />
The artwork is done well throughout the series and has a simple characteristic look aimed at the teens so nothing too special about them. The football while in a soccer match is done neatly and there is no use of CGI and everything is kept simple which is the best way. The &quot;Hissatsu Techniques&quot; as well are drawn beautifully and never under-achieves. <br />
<br />
Inazuma Eleven is like a dose of childhood to me, I can keep watching this numerous times and it won&#039;t disappoint me in a slight way. If you&#039;re a football/soccer freak like me then this series is a must see, even if you&#039;re not then as well I&#039;d recommend you to watch it. It&#039;s very exciting throughout and with the addition of the cool Hissatsu moves it only adds its reputation and for me it cements its position as  one of the best sport anime out there. <br />

    Before &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; came along, I always thought &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; represented very well the football issue (&quot;football&quot; in UK, &quot;soccer&quot; in USA). It still does, altough it can be a bit boring sometimes (the first episodes of the 1983 version are unforgettable)<br />
<br />
But in my opinion, so far, &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; is really the best, with &quot;Ganbare Kickers&quot; coming in second place. Sure there&#039;s a bit of exageration with those football moves when playing a game, but the football game moments are nice to see (nice sound and art as well)<br />
<br />
What&#039;s really the best is the story out of the football games combined with a great cast

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17640">
        of characters (when a character is included, the story only gets better): there&#039;s some great moments for comedy and drama in there<br />
<br />
Junko Takeuchi is always great when she voices the main character, Endou Mamoru. No wonder: she also showed that in &quot;Hunter x Hunter&quot; (Gon Freecs) and &quot;Naruto&quot; (Uzumaki Naruto)<br />
<br />
All in all, a great anime and hoping for more suprises in it

    In December of 2015, I decided to pick a bunch of non- seasonal anime that I wanted to watch alongside the Winter 16 anime season. One of these series was Inazuma Eleven.<br />
Now I went into this anime with very low expectations due to the fact that I don&#039;t like sports that much plus some of my least favourite sports are football, boxing volleyball and baseball. So I was expected to hate this anime because of it. As again I don&#039;t like sports that much and honestly I was expecting to kinda hate this anime. Was I wrong in my personal judgement or I am right?<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230389">
        story in Inazuma Eleven follows a cheerful goalkeeper captain named Endou Mamoru who is looking for members to join the Raimon Soccer Club. However due to Raimon Soccer Club only having 6 players the student body council president named Natsumi threatens the Raimon Soccer Club by disbandment if they wont win a game by Teikoku Gakuen as well getting enough players. When Raimon recruited enough players they faced off with Teikoku Gakuen however Raimon Soccer were competently outclassed. When all hope was lost at the very last second a striker named Gouenji helps the Raimon team to score a point using a powerful hissatsu technique called Fire Tornado. Shocked about the power Teikoku Gakuen forfeits the match where Raimon Soccer Club won by default. This gives Endou along with the Raimon Soccer members hope that they will one day win the Football Frontier. From there Endou along with the Raimon Soccer members would aimed to become the best soccer time like no other team ever was.<br />
Inazuma Eleven is split up into three main arcs as well as some subplots that take place during the main arcs.<br />
Football Frontier Arc (EP1-26)<br />
Ailea Academy Arc (EP27-EP65)<br />
Football Frontier International Arc (EP66-127 End)<br />
Honestly, the story isn&#039;t the strongest part of Inazuma Eleven. I am going to be real honest it&#039;s one of its weaker parts of the story especially in the earlier episodes of the first arc which I found to be cheesy at times but at the same time, I just can&#039;t help to really get invested by it.<br />
The first half it execution. In my opinion, you can make even the most boring sounding setups really good if you can get the execution just right and Inazuma Eleven just that. Honestly, I don&#039;t care if the sport is realistic or not because for I only care about the execution more than anything else<br />
The other half are the subplots and in my opinion, they are some best subplots I have ever seen in any anime. They are just really handled well, and they add life to the characters which prevent them from being boring and generic shounen characters.<br />
All of the arcs were all very enjoyable to watch and they well directed because each arc knows to use its content really well.<br />
The show explores the theme for friendship, teamwork, value as well as overcoming your fears and weaknesses and this show manages to execute them perfectly.<br />
I really like the story for this one even though it’s on the little basic side for the most part. I don&#039;t think much more was needed because the execution of it was so well handled specially in seasons 2 and 3 where the writers decided to go all out.<br />
Great job director Katsuhito Akiyama.<br />
8.5/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
The characters are what really brings this show together because like with the story it is the execution was great.<br />
First, we have Endou Mamoru who is our main captain for the Raimon and later on Inazuma Japan as well as being the main goalkeeper for the team.<br />
Endou starts off as a goofy and kinda hot-headed protestant who has a passion for football but honestly as the series progresses he developed from a less goofy hot-headed main protagonist to a very determined and more responsible captain for the team. I actually adore this character because he is a well-developed character and a lovable one.<br />
I was really impressed with Endou as a who and that&#039;s why I adore him and he&#039;s one of my favourite’s characters in the show, to be honest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next up we have our main striker for Raimon Gouenji Shuuya<br />
Now like Endou he has a strong passion for football but unlike Endou, he&#039;s much calmer but self-centred but as the series progresses he much friendly to the team as having massive character development. Not to mention his subplot and backstory was just great and well told.<br />
Overall Gouenji is a great character on he’s own right.<br />
Lastly, we have Kidou Yuuto who is the brains and strategist player for Raimon who is formerly the Captain of the Teikoku Academy but now is an irreplaceable addition to Raimon Junior High. I can only say this much to this character because he is a walking spoiler character which he&#039;s side plot. Besides the one that I just mentioned because it happens early on the story anyway.<br />
All I can say about Kidou is he is an amazing character and he is one of the few complex characters.<br />
The rest of the characters are hit or mess depending on your tastes.<br />
For me, most of the characters were great because they had they own subplots which are well written for the most part and they fun to watch as well as being well developed. Sure there were a few miss characters but least they didn&#039;t damage the show for me.<br />
Then we have what is easily my favourite characters in Inazuma Eleven. Kazemaru Ichirouta.<br />
I honestly have grown attached with this because I just really liked how his very friendly as well as being competitive player not to mention I really adore his character design.<br />
In my opinion, Kazemaru is probably the most realistic character in this show personality wise.<br />
Overall the characters were awesome.<br />
9.5/10<br />
Visuals.<br />
Visually Inazuma Eleven is pretty good.<br />
The art of Inazuma Eleven is fresh and surprised greatly because I like the character designs for the most because they feel fresh and original.<br />
One thing that I liked that is the use of colour for each arc representing the mood and the tone of each arc.<br />
The football frontier arc has bright colour feel it to it but not full colourful while the Aliea Academy arc has a more depressing feel to it. Then we have the football frontier arc international arc which has more modern sports anime feel to it because of the colour usage and the art, in general, has greatly improved in terms of quality.<br />
The animation was surprising really good, and it stays consistent all the thought and when they players use hissatsu techniques its freaking amazing of how well animated they all are. Sure at times can use re-use the hissatsu animation but for a show like this, I didn&#039;t really bother me too much because they are amazingly animated.<br />
Also the character designs, for the most part, were great and unique.<br />
Sure there were a few questionable ones, but they didn&#039;t really bother me too much.<br />
This is by definitely Oriental Light and Magic finest work in terms of art and animation especially in season 3 (Football Frontier International Arc) where it looks absolutely beautiful at times putting some of the recent anime to shame at times.<br />
<br />
Overall the visuals were great.<br />
8/10<br />
Sound.<br />
The first time that I listened to the OST I personally found it lacklustre but over time I started getting used to it and I ended up completely loving the OST because how amazing it was.<br />
Hell, some of the tracks in Inazuma Eleven are emotional and just plain epic.<br />
Notable tracks include.<br />
Teikoku Gakuen Theme Empire Gakuen came!<br />
Mortal combat with the empire Gakuen<br />
Lethal Attack<br />
Gathering Circle<br />
Kanashii Kano<br />
All of the Opening and Endings themes are amazing. <br />
My favourite openings and endings in Inazuma Eleven are opening four and ending 1 because they fit very well with each other like the opening 4 adds hype for that arc while ending 1 closes that arc perfectly.<br />
The Japanese audio for the series was great, and the voice actors were well acted.<br />
Notable Seiyuu performance goes to Junko Takeuchi as Endou Mamarou, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Kidou Yuuto, Sanae Kobayashi as Natsumi Raimon, Rie Kugimiya aka (Tsundere Queen) as Toramaru Utsunomiya, Yuki Kaji as Kazuya Ichinose and Nishigaki, Yuka as Kazemaru Ichirouta.<br />
There&#039;s also an English dub. Please don&#039;t watch the English dub it&#039;s really bad. I watch the dub for this on Nintendo&#039;s anime channel just to see how it is and it was just awful. Not only the voices were bad but the audio quality itself is bad plus the story and characters development were butchered to all hell.<br />
All of the characters have different names, and they were really bad on that and the final nail of the coffin for this dub is the show cuts off after season 2 leaving you with an uncompleted story.<br />
I only watched the first 2 episodes for the dub for this I dropped it half way in the episode because the voices were just so freaking horrible to listen plus the voice actors had no emotion with the roles whatsoever.<br />
So there really no reason to watch Inazuma Eleven dubbed, and I won&#039;t take any points away because it&#039;s honestly hard to find an Inazuma Eleven dub nowadays let alone good quality.<br />
Overall besides what I said about the dub the I really love the OST, Openings, Endings and voice acting for the original Japanese audio<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
<br />
Inazuma Eleven might just be the anime that I realize I judged this too early.<br />
Am being really honest when I say that my opinions for this anime went from basically is just another mediocre sports anime to oh my god l freaking this anime so much!!!<br />
Seriously this went being something that I will hate to something that I will love, and it impressed me in so many ways that I will never think possible with a sports anime let alone a kid’s anime.<br />
This is just an awesome anime that I barely speak my praises enough. The story, the characters, the animation the OST, the openings the endings and the voice acting were all just great. I know it could easily have flopped, but execution for everything is so great.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a great sports anime that is entertaining and has a strong character cast I recommend Inazuma Eleven. It was a great series that I will forever love until the end of time<br />
Final Score 9/10<br />

    Inazuma Eleven, is one of the best animes in my life. The Story is incredible, love the plot, it&#039;s very original, not compared to Captain Tsubasa series, i watch the 80 episodes currently, the story in the first episodes are good.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
the true action starts in the season 2, when aliens attack, that episodes are epic. in the third season, the true institute Alien is comming to action. and the fourth and actual season the best players of Japan reunites forming the Inazuma Japan.<br />
<br />
The Art is Cool. Yasunori Mitsuda&#039;s music are awesome, and makes me enjoyment this anime more<br />
<br />
Love the Naruto&#039;s Seiyuu as Endou Mamoru.<br />
Love the

    Inazuma Eleven is what you would expect from a kids&#039; sport Anime. Full of sparks and over-the-top flashy moves, but little to none substance or story depth. I&#039;m totally not against the characters having super powers, but when this overused feature starts damaging the actually good on-going action, it doesn&#039;t work for me. The characters can apparently freeze time or increase the length of the soccer/football field so they can do one of their signature techniques (which makes no sense by the way, it just alter how strong the shoot will be, apart from some few dribble moves). I was also bothered by the repetitive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247910">
        formula that the anime kept after the first arc. After awhile, the final scores of the matches became futile as we all knew our heroes would emerge triumphant. I found myself urging for something unexpected to happen, but everything was just painfully predictable. <br />
<br />
The Anime, however, kept me insterested into it because of how amusingly absurd it was. I also enjoy this touring around style, so I got that going for me.

    This animè is one of the most annoying i have ever seen. It starts of like all other shounen series, but maybe the first one i have seen where the main character still have both his parents. Its about Endou Mamoru, a goalkeeper for a pathetic football team threatened to shut down if they can&#039;t get enought members and beat the best youth team in Japan. And that&#039;s how it starts, and escalades into one of the most dreadful manuscripts ever. <br />
<br />
The story is not bad because of lack of characters or the lack of plot. But the story itself is just utterly unrealistic. Its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34736">
        not about the football in or of itself, but more of the evil people plotting terrifying plans behind the courtain. The plot really pisses me of, and i can guarantee you, if you are not a 9 year old boy. You will get annoyed. <br />
Sometimes you would rather tear out your eyeballs and feed them to pigs than to watch particular segments of the episode.<br />
<br />
Im not gonna give you any spoilers, but this series is farther away from perfect than Pluto is from the Sun.<br />
<br />
But that is why i love it. I don&#039;t take it seriously at all. Ok, ill admit it. I always cheer for Endou and Inazuma Eleven/Inazuma Japan, even though i KNOW they are going to win. But i don&#039;t take the manuscript seriously at all. It&#039;s brilliant, watching evil people plotting to KILL children because of a youth club football match. It&#039;s so unrealistic that i cannot  describe how annoyed this series get me, and i kinda like that feeling to. I want to jump into the screen and knock some sense into them. But this isn&#039;t what fuels my &quot;need&quot; for this series. It has heart and soul, it got all the right messages morally. Even though you sometimes think the characters are abit one-dimensional. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even think the writers take themselves seriously. I think they blurt out ideas, laught at it, and make it fit. From one moment you are on a football field, the other, on a crime scene. Under pressure by a all powerfull leader that wants to take over the world. <br />
<br />
By using kids... on a football field.... <br />
<br />
You take my point?<br />
<br />
To sum it up.<br />
STORY-2- As you already have figured out, the story is dreadful. <br />
<br />
ART-9- I have no complaints about the artwork, some of it are pretty cool. The different &quot;Hissatsu techniques&quot; are pretty cool-looking, and good animation overall i must say. <br />
<br />
SOUND-8- My main focus when i watch anime is story and how much i enjoy it. But it&#039;s all relative, and you can&#039;t enjoy an anime without good sound, and i think they did a decent job here. I personally can&#039;t put my finger on any major flaws.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER-8- Shounen, everything from evil cocky guyes, to overtrusting guys who relies on their friends, and would die for them. Etc<br />
But it works on all other shows, so i see no reason why it shouldnt work here<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT-9-I have already explained why i enjoy this, i can disconnect my brain and just watch this, laught at the stupid plot.I give it a 9, because some scenes make me want to crush my computer in anger. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    Inazuma Eleven is my greatest accomplishment in anime with its 127 episodes. I can’t remember why I started it, but here I am, 127 episodes after. Yes, 127. That’s one point you must consider before starting this anime.<br />
<br />
Let’s begin with the plot. To summarize everything, some aliens came from outer space to destroy everything on Earth with a soccer ball. The team — that we are following — must stop them from doing so by winning a soccer tournament against them. You must be thinking it’s funny. You’re right, it is.<br />
<br />
Most episodes are soccer matches but sometimes there are some extra spices where they develop

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53727">
        characters, and in so many episodes, they have enough time to do so for everyone in the team. But characters are generic and it isn’t that worth following them. A great example is the leader who can’t stop believing in friendship… Dear God, how many shōnen have that annoying character? Of course, thanks to him, while they are always losing in the first half of their matches, they understand the power of the heart in the second half and win…<br />
<br />
One good point in Inazuma Eleven is that you can watch it even if you don’t like soccer. After all, this anime is unrealistic so this is mostly based on production values to be entertaining. There are good voice actors, soundtrack has also some entertaining themes (though there aren’t enough for its length). Animation is fluid, special techniques used in soccer have also great visual effects, no doubt about it.<br />
<br />
Then, if you ask me if I liked this anime, I can barely answer. On one hand, the plot isn’t moving on and is terribly repetitive, on the other hand, production values managed to keep me watching this series through the end.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Inazuma Eleven is an average anime; it is kids-oriented but not like a fairy tale or an original movie from Ghibli that we can still enjoy without being a kid anymore. You are now aware, it is not meant for people seeking for quality. Most kids kill some time watching shows on TV, I’d say Inazuma Eleven is one they should avoid to play real soccer instead.

    This is the first anime that I ever watched online. I was in love with the anime on tv, and unfortunately it only aired early in the morning at 6 am, so I set my alarm clock extremely early every time just to watch it. Unfortunately the dub version wasn&#039;t that far in my country, and I had to watch the rest of the show online. Glad I did.<br />
<br />
The first thing I want to say is that I&#039;d rate the sound of Inazuma Eleven the highest of all. In fact, out of all animes that I have watched so far, there was no anime I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165741">
        would rate the sound of as high as in this show. It used the opening and outro theme songs in the middle of episodes itself as well, which can make me love an anime over 9000 times more. The soundtracks were perfectly fitting with the scenes, and also beautifully orchestrated. I sometimes still listen to some of the soundtracks on youtube, or sing hum them out loud. The opening songs are all enjoyable as well.<br />
<br />
Next up is the story, which I don&#039;t rate that high. Some things are unrealistic, or found way too far, as if the makers had to come up with something, no matter how realistic, to make something else that&#039;s cool possible. And the whole second season doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense, but no spoilers on that. The difficulty scaling could be better too. Apart from that there are some touching scenes, characters have good background stories and their own strong personalities, and the connections between characters are strong as well. The art-style isn&#039;t outstanding, but pleasing to the eye and enjoyable, and every character is unique, a.k.a. every person has their own unique appearance and amazing hairstyle.<br />
<br />
I highly advice you to watch Inazuma Eleven. You can feel the tension on the soccer field. The amazing supernatural techniques can be so awesome, ranging from fire tornadoes to ghost hands, that you want to repeat them on the field in real life. When the main characters score a goal, you just want to cheer together with the crowd, and you feel bad for them as well when they loose. Simply one of the most enjoyable animes I&#039;ve ever watched.

    I randomly stumbled upon this anime, by finding an amazing OST from it. So I decided to look up the anime itself. At first I was a bit sceptical about 127 episodes. But when I got past the first 3 episodes it began to get interesting. The show introduces tons of characters, whereas you will see some re-appear again, and some will get tons of spotlight. Around 50% of the characters will get an in-depth background story, which allows the characters to develop even further. <br />
<br />
The main thing in the anime is soccer, at first I thought it would be plain ball kicking, but then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180264">
        they added &quot;abilities/skills&quot; to the ball kicking. It really caught my interest, that there were 200+ different abilities the show had to offer. It led to a big variety, which certainly keeps the show interesting. And the animation on those abilities were just fantastic. I was like O_O at them all.<br />
<br />
The story itself is really good, although it may get &quot;boring&quot; on the long term, due to some parts being really predictable. But every single Arc in Inazuma eleven was fantastic. I especially love the way different soccer teams were introduced, and their main &quot;theme&quot; by that I mean Jungle team, horror team and much more.<br />
<br />
The music is fantastic, and it really spices the show up, whilst also adding tons of atmosphere for the X situation in the anime. <br />
<br />
Overall I really enjoyed this anime, and can definitely recommend it.<br />
<br />

    Since I&#039;m not very fond of sports type anime, I can&#039;t compare it with any other of it&#039;s genre. But I can assure you that it&#039;s VERY GOOD. At first I thought it was kinda wierd coz it looked kiddish but within cartoon Network&#039;s 4 episodes in a row Saturday got me hooked (even with those aweful hindi dubs). <br />
<br />
Art wise, Inazuma Eleven scores high with great character designs, nice backgrounds etc. It is actally good.<br />
<br />
In sound department, theme songs are quite cheery and just the sort that gives you THAT feeling. The OPs have the soccer anthem feel while the EDs give you a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34240">
        nice sweet feeling. Voice acting is great as the voices suit the characters.<br />
<br />
Story is nice in your typical road to success way though they incorporate many fantasy-products (see gods, aliens, angels and demons etc.) but never the less is decent<br />
<br />
Charcters... now you are talking, surprisingly over the top yet lovable characters, they are the main thing of the story.  You can&#039;t help in fall in love with not just one but MANY characters of the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyable anime...give it a shot. You&#039;ll fall in love with it.

    I finished viewing a few days ago the first series of Inazuma Eleven. I have to admit that the result is not bad, although it is the umpteenth cores taken from a popular topic such as football. This time, however, we are not faced with mileage fields &quot;hill&quot; Holly e Benji or games that last bet on betting. Must be pointed out that the setting and the way in which the small players Raimon and the other teams are moving quite reminiscent of those of the movie Shaolin Soccer, with shots that become necessary secrets and balls of fire, ice, penguins with appear from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108843">
        ground to accompany the dynamics of the shot. The power ups then frame the various episodes in which the boys will perform new techniques with the result of workouts to the limits of the human. They will sacrifice and the will to never give up to lead the team to victory<br />
<br />
The story is well woven, starring a guy who dreams of winning the Football Frontier together with his team, Raimon fact. The difficulty, as expected, will soon fail, but thanks to the team spirit and the desire to always fight, Mark, the main character is going to make the situation more desperate.<br />
Football is here seen as a fun vehicle to make new friends and make connections. In fact, during the fighting the bad guys on duty will receive a severe lesson learning the true meaning of the word football.

    So there&#039;s a whole lot of animes that present about sports, mainly Football or Soccer (Well, they&#039;re both the same though), since the 19th century. And as far as i know, there are, (The rather famous) Captain Tsubasa, which has been done in many remakes (Particularly in graphics), Hungry Heart, and Shoot!. Well, that&#039;s all i know so far, actually. And now, which i want to review it to you, there&#039;s the Inazuma Eleven (Inazuma11 for short), which in my way of point, is rather odd.<br />
<br />
Story (3/10)<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know where to start, exactly. Because this is... well, what it is actually, is one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44079">
        section where i didn&#039;t like about the anime. What sicks me out actually, is it&#039;s a junior football game, where most bad guys, is soo obsessed in &quot;Killing&quot; the good guys. I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s a football game! In my childhood, me and my friends is maniacally in love with Captain Tsubasa, because it&#039;s SIMPLY cool, and nothing extraordinary... despite the shooting effects, of course. Then there&#039;s this....&quot;Powers&quot;, where it didn&#039;t explain itself of &quot;How the hell did he do that!?&quot;. For example; there&#039;s this kid who can make Kagebunshin (or if you&#039;re not a Naruto fan, it&#039;s something like self-cloning/multiplying... thing) to overtake a single person to take the ball from him. And there&#039;s this keeper, who can &quot;Summon&quot; thousands of aura-hands to capture a single shot. Well i&#039;m sorry, but i&#039;m TOTALLY prefer to watch Shaolin Soccer rather than something trying to be like one, who is not even close to, even if it&#039;s an anime.<br />
<br />
Sorry for not mentioning the REAL story review, because other than being a spoiler, it&#039;s just a standard kids show: Reaching to the top, or like Being a No.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
<br />
Not to underestimate the Art &amp; Animation, though. For a kids show, it&#039;s very top notch. Everything is so smooth and clean. And they take the camera angles very nicely. Although, some fillers take the roll repeatedly in some episodes, which will makes you think something new isn&#039;t coming. Fortunately, this rarely happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s the same as the Art &amp; Animation does, good qualities is in it&#039;s package.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character (6/10)<br />
<br />
Basically, this is a child&#039;s anime....sort of. So it&#039;s obvious that the character designs is to be made for kids to like, which in our current age, is of course, rather weird. And of course, most of their attitudes is mainly focuses on &quot;NEVER GIVE UP!&quot;, which is fine by me, since it&#039;s of course, good for children development.<br />
<br />
And as i said earlier, the antagonist is pretty sarcastic, or rather sadistic for a junior football game. Which is pretty annoying..<br />
<br />
So that&#039;s the Character, and now we&#039;re moving on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (4/10)<br />
<br />
How do i put this? It&#039;s ridiculous on it&#039;s story and the characters, but at the same time i kinda like the idea and the concept of the overall anime, which is something the anime didn&#039;t make it to what they&#039;re after. Well, i assume kids will like it though, but just imagine if they watch this, and they get obsessed with playing soccer, they&#039;re definitely going to ask their parents, &quot;Dad, why can&#039;t i summon my clones?&quot;. Why? Because like i said, the anime didn&#039;t explain itself about how those powers work, and technically, it&#039;s totally magical. If kids watch Captain Tsubasa, they&#039;ll find it out eventually how things work, like how Tsubasa could use the Drive Shoot, it explain itself how the technique works, &#039;cuz the theory is real (although some elements in C. Tsubasa taking it too much thx to the effects).<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10)<br />
<br />
So overall, it&#039;s not so good, but it has it&#039;s own unique concept of how football game can be.... on the other world. But truthfully, kids will like this. But always remind them: It&#039;s not going to happen.

    I don&#039;t have any interest in soccer, neither having a reason to watch a kiddy anime while I&#039;m, in fact, 17 years old, especially I like the dark, action theme animes instead of sport and light-hearted shows. My first meeting with IE was when someone used Fubuki Fanart as signature and it looked really beautiful ( I was deceived lol). My first thought was &quot;WTF is this, so ridiculous&quot; when watching IE GO. And yet, I was hooked by it, watched the whole IE GO series, and then watched IE. I would say, I love IE more than its sequel.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t expect a sport series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187550">
        has a plot beside &quot;Lettttt&#039;s playyyyy gamesssss&quot;, and yet, IE proved me wrong in many, many ways, especially the alien Arc, and I was like whatttt. Surprisingly, the arc ended up pretty well with the most reasonable solution that we can get and with all the character developments. The plot is never boring, in fact, you couldn&#039;t get bored because of how likable the characters are, how fun the hissatsu are to look at, and how the matchs are not really predictable. I couldn&#039;t guess whether the Raimon would win or lose in the Alien Arc, and maybe Raimon actually lost more than won in that arc. However, I think the reason that makes the plot successful is the pacing. The longest match would only be 3 and half episodes, and there would never be a moment that looked like the match just stops for characters to monologue. That is also the factor that makes some sport animes look like they&#039;re buying time (Kuroko no Basuke, Yowamuda Pedal, Diamond no Ace...). And yet, in fact, they actually said in the interview that they were buying time by throwing a random match in, but we would never realize (LOL). I also like the fact that the series doesn&#039;t treat us like kids, they already say &quot;it&#039;s a super-dimensional soccer, and this&#039;s how IE world works, deal with it.&quot; That&#039;s why, even though it&#039;s ridiculous, we can accept it, while some serious animes out there, trying to look as realistic as possible, but end up having unrealistic powers (KnB - no, I don&#039;t hate it, I have the whole mangas, but it&#039;s the best example) and stupid reasons and twists that comes out of thin air (Gunslinger Strator, Valvrave...). IE doesn&#039;t treat itself serious, and that&#039;s why we can easily accept it later instead of the annoying feeling hanging in our throats. The balance between goody and sad moments is also perfect, it never gets really bitter and makes us hard to swallow, while keeping the depth in characters&#039; personalities.<br />
<br />
The most thing I like about the series is the characters, and I can feel a strong connection to somes like Fubuki, Kazemaru, and maybe Hiroto, and sometimes I would just wish I have a friend like Endou, he is like a sunshine to everyone. In a show that have so many characters, you wouldn&#039;t expect all of them will have backstories, and yet, in IE, all of them would always have one or at least time to shine, although the story would only focus on certain one, like Fubuki and Hiroto in Alien Arc...This wonderful character developments is thank to the amount of episodes, because it&#039;s more effective when it takes long time for them to surpass their fears, like in reality. We can&#039;t easily change in such 1 or 2 episodes, like most short-term animes love to portray. Fubuki did take nearly 40 episodes to finally change, and his struggle takes like 10 episodes, continuously trembled and couldn&#039;t face soccer direcly. However, the director did a perfect job in expressing his deep fear, and we would never yell at Fubuki &quot;Godarnit get over it already.&quot; I was sincerely hoping he would get over his fear somedays soon, and when he finally did, I was really happy, and decided to change myself like him. Also, the character&#039;s design are really cool, even though it gets overboard sometimes lol, but at least we can easily recognize who with who.<br />
<br />
Music is also a strong part of the series, and I would say the music director did a really great job in inserting the OP and ED in the matchs. Many times, the music make me feel goose bump during the match, when it&#039;s not actually that exciting. As expect of one that did the music for many series! The OST are just fun to listen to, and there are some piano songs that really nostagic whenever they&#039;re played in sad parts. <br />
<br />
The weakness of the series would be its animation, but it never gets really bad as some A-1&#039;s shows, so it&#039;s okay.<br />

    Inazuma Eleven is my favorite anime of all time. The main reason why, is because I was watched it in my childhood and it became very sentimental and nostalgic for me.<br />
<br />
Rating<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Art: 7<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Characters: 9<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
If that&#039;s my favorite anime, why did I give it 7 as an overall rating?<br />
Well, because the anime is not perfect... Just because I love it, it doesn&#039;t mean I have to give it the best score that I can. Let&#039;s take the graphics as an example - it&#039;s kinda dull (I know it&#039;s not a new anime, and it got some time on it&#039;s record, but still) and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348946">
        it could&#039;ve been better. <br />
__________________<br />
The anime&#039;s story is surprisingly good as for a football anime.<br />
It&#039;s not all about just a game of football, but the plot divided into 3 arcs is very varied and interesting.<br />
The main concept of giving characters abilities called &quot;Hissatsu&quot; that they use during the matches to score goals is a basic example of shonen-typed anime and it is very exciting for younger people to watch.<br />
Each character has his own personality that affects his playing style which in the end affects the result of the match.<br />
Main characters are struggling with new problems every new story arc, new stronger opponents appear which means that some new techniques are needed in order to defeat them.<br />
I was very sucked in by the anime when I was still just a little brat, even though in my country Only first arc (27 episodes) were transmited in the TV and when few years later I watched the whole series I had the best time of my life.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to commend Inauzma&#039;s openings! Although they&#039;re a bit similiar to each other it is still fun to listen to and build up some excitement.<br />
<br />
When it comes to some cons...<br />
As for the first arc, matches are quite simple and they last 1-2 episodes, but it&#039;s just a beginning, so yeah. Bot for example in the 3rd arc matches can last even 4-5 episodes, which is somehow good, but boring, and that&#039;s a little bad aspect of the anime :/<br />
And yeah, it&#039;s a shonen anime, so of course most of the time viewers know what&#039;s gonna happen next in some situations (but hey, it&#039;s still kinda thrilling!).<br />
<br />
Summarizing, I think that&#039;s this anime is worth a shot for everybody, even if you don&#039;t like football (well, &#039;cause I don&#039;t). If you&#039;re getting bored with the 1st arc, try to get to at least 2nd arc, because it&#039;s gonna get craaazy.<br />
<br />
Once again - it&#039;s my favorite anime of all time!<br />
<br />

    It&#039;s very good I used to think soccer was boring before I watched this, I love all the characters(mostly Shirou) the dramatic scenes and stories of each character is amazing and I like the action and friendship towards everyone. I say to watch it it&#039;s my favorite anime and If you like shonen/digimon/sport animes watch it! I thought the football frontier was interesting seeing other countries compete. I learned many things about soccer and makes me play it. Shows you practice and hard working is part of life. It felt like I was watching a soccer soap opera. If you love energetic/serious/adorable guys it&#039;s for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48603">
        you. The girls weren&#039;t annoying like in most animes they helped and tried their best for the team. The music is amazing and I suggest you listen to ryuusei boy or the 7th ending. All openings are great too. I love the characters&#039; names and voices. The only thing I don&#039;t like is the english dub they made two guys into girls and changed all their names. Watch the movie and the second season go! The movie was really good and the second season reminds you of this season they&#039;re planning to have a second movie :) This really made me cry all the drama and I love the cute episode when they&#039;re in tuxes. Let me admit this all the guys are sweet and work hard most of these guys are hotties I mean this is a kids show but It&#039;s just that awesome. It has a manga and video games too. So If you haven&#039;t seen you better watch it! :D

    This is not the typical anime that I usually watch. If I saw myself watching this 2 years ago I would be pretty embarrassed. But as it happens I came across this anime while watching TVTokyo at 4 in the morning waiting for Bleach to come on. At first I thought it was ridiculous but it really got me hooked. This series is not like any soccer anime you might have seen before. It is over the top, most the characters develop super powers (but only when they play soccer), and often times they just throw the actual rules of soccer out the window. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33045">
        that&#039;s what makes the show, its just over the top fun. If you are in between watching animes and just want something lighthearted to watch, then this is probably the show for you. The series follows a story but for the most part each episode has it&#039;s own plot so you can pick up the series whenever and still understand whats going on. Personally I just pick it up in between more heavy shows just to pick my mood up.<br />
     This is a recommend for everyone. Ya, it&#039;s a little kiddy but who really cares. If you like a show that takes something normal and blows it completely out of proportion then you will probably like this show. Just go turn it on, I promise you won&#039;t regret it.

<br />
Ah, Inazuma Eleven this sure brings back memories. I grew up watching this show, but I never really watched it, I am talking about how I have seen most of the episodes but I never really followed it. Untill now, I watched the anime in its full glory, and it didn&#039;t dissapoint! So today I shall share my opinion and thoughts on this anime that I myself consider a classic. Lastly for the sake of this review I will use the subbed names of the characters and not the dubbed names.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10: So the story is just your average underdog sports story. We

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320251">
        follow the likes of Endou Mamoru and his school team Raimon. In the first episode we get straight into the good stuff. They have to face off against the strongest team in the competition Royal Academy and if they lose their soccer-club gets closed. And so Endou starts looking for teammates since he doesn&#039;t have enough members. After a long day he manages to get eleven players and they face off against Royal Academy who makes a dramatic entrance. Im not going to explain the match in detail but for short: Raimon lost, but even so during the match a player named Goenji Shuuya, when he switched with a player he made a goal against Royal Academy with his special move &quot;Fire Tornado&quot;. And because of that even though they lost the club keeps exisiting since Royal thinks they have potential. After that they play against various teams. This was only the first arc of the anime and I won&#039;t talk about the rest of the story since then this review will be ludicrously long. But like I said it is your typical underdog story so sometimes it gets predictable, but that doesn&#039;t take away the epic moment where they go beyond their limits and release a new speical move!<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10: Inazuma Eleven has an amazing Sound Track seriously, it is my favorite OST to this day! And you could say that is because it feels so nostalgic and in that case you aren&#039;t wrong, but the sound track truly is something to be proud of, they did a fantastic job!<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters 8/10: So  the characters, there is a insane amount of them, but even so most of them still have great development and a good backstory. For example you have Ichinose: he is a big soccer fan but had a incident when he was a little kid making him unable to play soccer for a long time, But even so he doesn&#039;t give up on his dream to go international. It is those kind of characters that get the show going. They all have their own motivation to win and become the best in the world.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10: The show really is enjoyable for everybody, if you&#039;re a kid or even if you are a 15-year-old weeb such as myself, Inazuma Eleven just has this satisfying feeling of seeing your favorite character(s) score a goal or surpass their limits, but like I mentioned earlier. Because it is your typical underdog story sometimes it gets predicable and in that case it is still fun, but it doesn&#039;t catch that same satisfying feeling anymore. All in all it is fairly enjoyable to watch alone or with your friends.<br />
<br />
Overal 8/10: Overall the show is a great mix of characters, flashy abillities, Great music and Nostalgia. If you grew up with other anime like Pokémon or Avatar then you&#039;ll like this too, it has the same kind of cast of characters and a world that is made with care and love for soccer!<br />
<br />
Hope you all liked my review and found it helpfull, I wish you all luck in watching this anime, if you are gonna watch it that is, well then see you soon!
