    Title: Victorian Romance Emma<br />
<br />
Manga/Novels: Victorian Romance Emma began as a manga by self-professed Anglophile Kaori Mori, and ran in Monthly Comic Beam from August 30th, 2002 to April 12th, 2006.  The manga won an Excellence Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2005.  CMX has licensed the manga Stateside, and the fourth of eight volumes was released June 20th of this year.  The manga has ended its run in Japan, but Kaoru Mori continues to publish side stories (known as Emma Bangaihen), and is set at eleven side stories, the ninth of which was released recently.  The manga is known

          <span style="display: none;" id="review915">
        to have something of a cult following and apparently has an Emma-inspired/themed caf&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; in Shibuya to it&#039;s name.<br />
<br />
Saori Kumi has also done novel adaptations of the manga, and two volumes were released in 2005.<br />
<br />
The anime was done by Studio Perrot (famous for Bleach, Midori no Hibi and Blood+) and directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi (who also directed The Twelve Kingdoms), and ran on TV from April 2nd, 2005 to June 18th, 2005.  The Right Stuf International announced its Stateside licensing of Emma and it&#039;s second season (Victorian Romance Emma: The Second Act, which is not covered in this review) on June 30th, and plans to release it solely with subs and in a box set; a release date has not been announced at this time.		<br />
<br />
Story: The story kicks off with William Jones, a member of the gentry, visiting his old governess unexpectedly.  Because he stands almost right in front of the door, he gets knocked off his feet (literally and figuratively) by the governess&#039; maid, Emma, when she opens the door.  And I&#039;m betting that you can probably guess what happens based on the series&#039; title, albeit with some added angles.<br />
<br />
But one of the many things that makes this series stand out is the slow pacing of the romance.  For some, it&#039;s going to be agonizingly slow (it takes William half the series to offer to take her out somewhere, and just over that for him to actually do so and kiss her while he&#039;s at it, which, at that point, is considered leaps and bounds), but for me, it&#039;s just right, especially with the sweetness and fluffiness of it all.  I guarantee that you will be grinning like an idiot as you watch it develop.<br />
<br />
With regards to faithfulness to its manga source: I&#039;ve only got the first volume of the series to my name at this point in time, but from what I saw, the series was extremely faithful to the source, down to the angles of certain scenes.<br />
<br />
Another thing that makes me absolutely adore this series is the way that the series invests you in every single one of the characters.  It&#039;s a rare series that actually makes you feel - really, honestly care -- for characters that are clearly supposed to be &amp;quot;in the way&amp;quot;.  One of the best examples of this is Elanor, a girl of the gentry who is clearly meant to be &amp;quot;the other woman&amp;quot;, and one of the the odd ones out in the triangle... square... thingy.  But you honestly feel sorry for her, because she&#039;s just as much in love with William as he and Emma are with each other, and it&#039;s her first love, and it just absolutely sucks that it&#039;s unrequited on her end, and that she&#039;s clearly wasting her time with William.  And the way that it does Emma&#039;s past would have seemed Sue-ish and annoying in any other show, but doesn&#039;t here.<br />
<br />
But the thing that makes this series absolutely shine is the historical accuracy.  Apparently, Kaoru Mori hired a historical consultant (Rico Murakami) from the third volume of the manga on to ensure accuracy; Murakami was also hired for the anime, and it shows.  The subs I watched also included little historical notes at the end of each episode to explain unfamiliar/obscure things to the average viewer.  Murakami and Mori released a companion guide (Emma Victorian Guide) that does the same thing.<br />
<br />
And this historical accuracy holds, even in the resolution of the show.  Shoujo diehards are probably going to absolutely hate the ending (don&#039;t worry; there&#039;s the second season if you dislike the ending that much), because it doesn&#039;t hold to shoujo standards.  But you know what?  After how historically accurate the series was, it wouldn&#039;t have seemed right for things to turn out any other way.<br />
<br />
Art: This is one of the places where faithfulness to the manga holds.  Pierrot&#039;s animation, which is beautiful in and of itself, is barely different at all from the art style that Kaoru Mori used in the manga.  As such, it&#039;s just like watching the manga come to life in front of your eyes.  Even details down to the angle of certain scenes from the manga hold, which makes seeing your favorite scenes from the manga that much more awesome.<br />
<br />
Music: Emma has a unique OP and ED, in that none of them have any vocals to them; it&#039;s all just instrumentals.  But the thing is that they&#039;re still very memorable, even without lyrics.  I prefer the OP (which is so calming that I&#039;ve been using to get to sleep lately) over the ED (which sounds fairly circus-y).<br />
<br />
The music for the series itself consists of a lot of variations on the OP and ED, but has its share of original music, too.  And every bit of it is beautiful, especially in the way that it uses strings and piano.  And I&#039;d be willing to bet that every bit of it could easily fit in the Victorian Period.<br />
<br />
Seiyuu: There aren&#039;t any particular standout roles in this series, but on the other hand, there aren&#039;t any that suck terribly.  Just a fairly standard set of voices.  No problems on my end.<br />
<br />
Dub: N/A<br />
<br />
Length: Twelve episodes seems like a perfect length for this series.  There&#039;s not any push to rush the series along, and it doesn&#039;t plod along, even though the story goes at a slower pace than most series.  It&#039;s at just the right pace.  <br />
<br />
For those who didn&#039;t like the ending, or want more Emma, there is the second season that I&#039;ve mentioned throughout this review (Victorian Romance Emma: The Second Act).  However, know going into it that subs only go up to the ninth episode, because of its licensing.<br />
<br />
Overall: This is far from your standard shoujo series.  The historical accuracy, which adds in a defiance of typical shoujo standards, and the way it invests you in every one of its characters make it shine.  The slower pacing of the episodes and the romance feels just right, and the faithfulness to the manga source in story and art style are a real treat.  The music and seiyuu add the icing on the cake.  <br />
<br />
This is one of my top five recommended series.  See it.  NOW.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Music: 9/10<br />
Seiyuu: 8/10<br />
Length: 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 47/50; 94% (A)<br />
<br />
<br />

    Story: VRE&#039;s story is very simple and easy to follow, two people from vastly different social classes fall in love with one another and throughout the series we get to see their trials and tribulations while dealing with it. Forbidden love is nothing new, but that doesn&#039;t mean this series is bland in any respect, there are plenty of dealings to keep the story lively. The nice thing, too, is that there is a lot of historical accuracy in the details, it keeps true to the time and doesn&#039;t pull any weirdo stuff for gimmick appeal. The story neither drags nor goes by too fast,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9103">
        it&#039;s paced perfectly. <br />
<br />
Art: The character designs are cute and some of the scenery is nice, but this is definitely one of the drawbacks. The animation wasn&#039;t done that great, it&#039;s kind of grainy and basic. It&#039;s not something I would expect for when it was made, but we can&#039;t always get what we want. Honestly, you won&#039;t pay too much attention to the art anyways, you&#039;ll be engrossed in the story and characters.<br />
<br />
Sound: The music is just quaint. It goes really well with the story and pretty much always fits the scenes. The opening and ending themes are especially cheerful and fun. It would have gotten a 10 from me, but it wasn&#039;t amazing music, it just fit really well. <br />
<br />
Characters: The characters are one of the strongest points of the series. They&#039;ve all got their different motivations and cover a wide variety of types so it&#039;s always fun. The two main characters, Emma and William, are very laid back characters, they&#039;re not hyper or weird at all... which is very nice. They are extremely interesting people with a multitude of layers behind them. There are a few characters that feel a little out of place for their time, but they are smaller roles so it won&#039;t affect much or be that noticeable/detracting for the story. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Simply put, it&#039;s a really fun series. It&#039;s great watching the characters change throughout the story while dealing with their feelings and society. Everything is just done right, it&#039;s not over the top or lacking at all. I&#039;m not one for romances usually, but this one could hook anybody I believe. <br />
<br />
<br />
... first review, be gentle. When I write more I&#039;ll try to write better.

    Emma - A Victorian Romance is a series about a member of the gentry, William Jones, who who falls in love with a maid, and the hardships they endure due to the differences between the classes. As William&#039;s family stops at nothing to dissuade him from the romance, it comes off a little bit like Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet with all the external tribulations preventing the couple from realizing their love. Of course both William and Emma both have a central character that provides them with encouragement when the going gets tough.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a classic romance that seems to stray from the cliches that abound in typical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6383">
        anime, mostly because of the style and the setting. The series takes place in 19th century Victorian London and seems to be quite accurate in it&#039;s portrayal. You also won&#039;t find any green or blue hair here, many of the colors of the people and the setting are subdued with shades of tan and brown.<br />
<br />
Emma took a couple of episodes to draw me in, but I was hooked after that. I found the historical context of the setting to be pretty intriguing, and mostly I just wanted to find out what happens between William and Emma and if they can overcome their obstacles.<br />
<br />
I did have a little bit of difficulty finding something to like about Emma, she was a little too reserved and bland to warrant the attention that William gave her. The most interesting character imho, Hakim, could probably stand to have a little more scene time to liven up the series a bit. Animation is good, but nothing to write home about. As there really isn&#039;t any action going on here, there isn&#039;t much need for dynamic pans and ultra-fluid movement. DVDs are in subs only, which is perfectly fine with me as I always watch subs anyway, but it could pose a problem for dub fans. Finally, as this affects my review score, [SPOILER ALERT] the ending leaves a bit to be desired, I suppose they were paving way for the second series, but I didn&#039;t find it too satisfying after investing the time to watch the series. [END SPOILER]

    I don&#039;t watch romance animes too much. Usually only when I get tired of  animes with too much testosterone (shounen animes). But I can safely say of the few romance animes I&#039;ve watched so far, Victorian Romance Emma is my favorite of them all. <br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story is really simple it reminded me of Cinderella with just some alterations. Rich young man meets beautiful maid, falls in love with her and goes after her. Due to the difference in their statuses, various problems arise. One thing I liked about the story is that it didn&#039;t feel like your typical japanese anime. I felt that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14401">
        it had a more western feel to it which was refreshing. The situations in the story are not far-fetched and are believable that it can happen. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Since I&#039;m fascinated with culture, this anime impressed me because its depictions of London during its time were accurate. For its kind of anime, the creator did a good job of depicting Victorian London.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The music suits the anime well. Nothing too fancy about it. Just like the laid back atmosphere of the anime, the music is also laid back and supports the scenes well.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
The characters are the foundation of a great story. The 2 main characters are what made this story great because its a romance story. The reason that I said earlier in my review that this had a western feel to it is that in this anime, the man courts and asks the woman out. So far, in most of the romance animes I&#039;ve watched, the girl confesses to the guy she likes (which I think is very wrong). In my opinion, a guy should be the first to make the move to a girl he&#039;s interested in. The male main character did this and this is why I admire him.    <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I really enjoyed this anime. It&#039;s unlike any other animes I&#039;ve seen so far. Even with its simple premise, it was still interesting for me. Another factor that made me enjoy this anime was the accurate and detailed depiction of Victorian London. It gave me an idea of what life was like during the Victorian era. One of my favorite scenes in the anime was when they went to the beach (I forgot if it happened in this season or in the sequel). It was a learning experience to see what nobles usually do during their era when they went to the beach.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
I gave it a 10 because this anime was worth watching and was memorable. I highly recommend it for a change of pace of what you normally watch. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m too lazy to write another review for its sequel so here&#039;s a short review. The sequel was also very good and a little better than its predecessor because new characters were introduced. Since its a sequel, you must watch it to conclude the story. I felt very satisfied after watching this anime.<br />

    *Review is for both seasons of &#039;Emma&#039;*<br />
<br />
Stop me if you&#039;ve heard this one before: a boy and a girl from different social classes fall in love, but find the path to happiness will not be easy. OK, not the most original premise, but combine Mori-sensei&#039;s lovely artwork, a good sense of atmosphere, a thorough lack of pretentiousness, and general lack of melodrama and we just might have an anime thats worth a watch.<br />
<br />
&#039;Emma&#039; is licensed by Nozomi Entertainment and can be watched for free on their YouTube channel. Nozomi also produced a 2-part US DVD release.<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
<br />
It&#039;s 1890&#039;s Victorian Britain. Class divisions are so rigid that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186708">
        the various levels of the social order are practically different worlds. So when the son of a prosperous merchant falls in love with a maid the road is bound to be rocky. The story is full well-known tropes, it&#039;s hardly a genre-buster. But these tropes are played so earnestly straight that it&#039;s hard to hate them, even if the next event isn&#039;t exactly unpredictable. It&#039;s simple, it&#039;s sweet, and it doesn&#039;t pretend to be anything more than that. ( The series even lampshades its well-worn formula during one scene in a bookshop when a couple of background characters talk about a book telling the story of a maid and a noble who fall in love- as if to subtly acknowledge how long the basic plot has been around ). Most importantly, the central conflict of the series is very believable, rooted in the main characters&#039; personalities and the world they inhabit- that&#039;s not always a given in this genre.<br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
<br />
Karou Mori excels at drawing two things: 1) Beautiful women 2) Historically accurate and highly detailed costumes. You&#039;ll see plenty of both here. Emma&#039;s design is particularly pleasing (although I must confess a preference for meganekkos, so my bias is likely at work). The aesthetic is pleasant to look at, using lots of lighter pastel colors to create a relaxing atmosphere. The animation quality is good, but nothing particularly special. This isn&#039;t an action series, so it doesn&#039;t have to be.<br />
<br />
-Sound-<br />
<br />
Little to say here. The soundtrack is relaxing, never overbearing, using lots of flutes. It goes for a period-appropriate sound and sets the mood, but none of the tracks made me want to look it up on YouTube. The show is English sub only, and the Japanese voice actors do their jobs fine without standing out. Emma&#039;s voice was above average, as her actress managed to convey her shy, quiet personality. Sound does its job with no significant problems.<br />
<br />
-Characters-<br />
<br />
Again, the show sticks pretty close to formula here. Shy female lead, shy male lead, male lead has an outgoing best friend, etc. What most impressed me were the antagonist characters, nearly all of them behaved in a believable way and had reasonable motivations to inhibit the romance given what they knew (and they knew as much as they could reasonably be expected to know- no convenient ignorance just for the sake of drama). There is one antagonist who isn&#039;t exactly subtle, but he shows up fairly rarely and never goes to full-scale &#039;Rose of Versailles&#039; melodrama, so it&#039;s bearable.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
<br />
An anime to watch if you want something sweet that isn&#039;t saccharine, while also being pleasant and relaxing. Each episode is fairly light without feeling empty and pointless, meaning you&#039;re probably going to want to watch several episodes in a row. What else can I say? It&#039;s enjoyable.<br />
<br />
-Overall-<br />
<br />
This anime knew it was a straight-forward old-fashioned romance and didn&#039;t pretend to be anything else. It came, it did what it meant to do, did it well, and it left before the audience got tired. There&#039;s no shame in that, especially in a genre with no shortage of shows that sink into melodrama and pretentiousness in a failed attempt to do too much.

    At the beginning, I was very much fascinated by it. It seemed to get directly to the point and have the plot going right away. However, that didn&#039;t last long. The romance seemed a little dragged out, and although I did enjoy it, I think it moved to slow to keep the interests of the majority of the anime-watching population.<br />
<br />
The art, I actually became fond of it after a couple episodes. The faces seemed a bit too round for my tastes, and sometimes looked a bit big, but after a while it seems perfectly fine. I do have to say, I&#039;ve never seen so many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21932">
        blonds in a show before.<br />
<br />
The beginning theme was very intriguing. It was soothing, almost like a lullaby, but something that lifted your spirits rather than making you drowsy. I think it was very well composed.<br />
<br />
Once again, it moved slowly, even with only 12 episodes. You get a feel for who the characters are, but they don&#039;t change very much. Static characters aren&#039;t necessarily bad, but I prefer characters who go through ordeals that noticeably change them. The protaganists to change some what, but I don&#039;t think they made it obvious enough to emphasize the amount of emotion involved. And on the subject of emotion, Emma seemed completely void of them sometimes. I don&#039;t want her to be a whiny little baby, but I certainly don&#039;t want her going around with such a usual serious face when supposedly she&#039;s gotten her heart broken for the first time.

    *This review includes both seasons. Spoilers shall be avoided! English is not my native language - mistakes in grammar shall be made!*<br />
<br />
I love history - especially the European, and Victorian history! I love romance - presumed it&#039;s done with passion, care and interest! That being said, Monogatari Emma should&#039;ve been almost perfect watch for me, but sadly... the ever-so short twelve-episodes seasons are just the tip of the iceberg, in what this anime seemingly refused to do right for me!<br />
<br />
Story (4)<br />
<br />
The story is... well, it&#039;s not good! It is actually so bland, unimaginative and uninspired, that I could easily call it the Twilight-level of horribleness,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241737">
        and wouldn&#039;t blink an eye, while saying so! If I would give some random 15-year-old girl a book about Victorian era, told her to read it, then write a love story that takes place on that said era, Monogatari Emma would be exactly what I would get! And what saddens me even more is that... this is almost exactly the same story, that I would&#039;ve writen myself... with the atmost miserable ending, of course! <br />
<br />
The romances taking place in Victorian era were all pretty much all the same - triangle-dramas, deceat, debauchery, strickt laws an norms of class society between those who got it all, and those who have nothing are all the traits that are just as common now, as they were back then, thus very little room or space to develope is been given. It&#039;s all put in line with one of the most restricted formulas for a romance that you could ever think of, because the choises according to such stories, are always the same - either skip the historical accurasies (Pocahontas II) and give people what they want, or keep the facts, and... suck at romance, because God knows Victorians were bland as paint with that!<br />
<br />
Monogatari Emma has nothing in it&#039;s story, that stands out from any other romance or love story, that takes place in this certain era, or that handles such themes like class society, &quot;we who are all, and those who are nothing&quot;- consept, prejudice and accepting the norms and expectations of the sociaty, that pretty much tells you everyday, how to live your live accordingly. It&#039;s a cute little window to the world that&#039;s - mostly! - already long gone, both in cultural and social sence, but other than that... it&#039;s not worth of my interest. I&#039;ve seen better Victorian romances from... anywhere, and if Monogatari Emma&#039;s story is what I should use as a comparison, I shall continue doing so in the future as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (7)<br />
<br />
The artstyle of Monogatari Emma is cute... it&#039;s pretty, and it&#039;s... well, not the most liveliest, but it does it&#039;s job, looking like a old photo, or an oil-painting, almost, in some parts. It holds little to no splashes of color, which makes it really monotonous and bland... much like the story and the characters. It&#039;s still somewhat nice to look at, but sadly... evenn though being it&#039;s saving grace, it&#039;s just not enough to &quot;save&quot; this anime. <br />
<br />
In romance, I need something to feel - not something to look at!<br />
<br />
Sound (6)<br />
<br />
The voice actors do decent job while playing their characters, but none of them truly standed out for me. They&#039;re all pretty generic - easy to listen, and easy to forget - and the less I&#039;ll be saying about the music, the better! This is just... the most awful Victorian music, right here! It has no life nor soul in it... nothing, that would hold my interest over a bland story, and even blander characters... and it really pisses me off, because Victorian music is not this... bland! It shouldn&#039;t be!<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (4)<br />
<br />
...or the lack of the characters, more likely. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s keep it short and sweet, shall we. These characters... are cut-outs! Bland and boring cut-outs, every single one of them! We have our idiot-boy-in-love, his quirky best friend... with a indian harem, and an elephant... and our leading lady is a blander-than-blander twat, that somehow charms the Indian prince to courtship her... and she barely says a freaking word to anyone!<br />
<br />
Ironically, main heroine Emma, is my biggest gripe against this anime, and for a good reason, might I say! She&#039;s supposed to be this &quot;poor, unfortunate but sweet soul&quot;, picked and raised from the utmost poverty and misery, that falls in love with a handsome nobleman, but... despite of what I just told about her, she&#039;s really not that interesting as a character! Much like the art style, she&#039;s just a decent painting, with no color - no shades, no shadows, and seemingly no flaws to speak of! She never speaks, she never shares her emotions to anyone, neither does she show them - I&#039;m starting to doubt that she even has any of those! - and even when she&#039;s being separated from her love, only to find herself a new one - because, apparently, glasses and stone-like expressions are sooo attractive! - she just seems to think herself &quot;Duuuu....&quot; and move along with the story, like a mindless puppet... not wanting anything, not saying anything... doing nothing! <br />
<br />
I hate heroines like Emma, and when this whole story is pretty much about just her and her &quot;struggles&quot; with forbidden love... I just can&#039;t believe that I didn&#039;t drop this anime all together, thanks to her!<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (5)<br />
<br />
The best word to describe Monogatari Emma, is generic... or mediocre, if you like. It has nothing look at, nothing to feel for, and nothing to remember right after the first watching. Anyone who knows anything about romances knows, how this story&#039;s gonna end, and even without the historical accurasies, it was pretty ludicrous to look at, even for me!<br />
<br />
This is the basic of the basics - the absolute bare-boned sceleton of a standard romance-formula, that was blooming even in the earliest Victorian era&#039;s novels, poetry, arts and writings. Monogatari Emmas&#039; consept may&#039;ve been new and innovative... maybe even naughty and dangerous for those times, but after seeing so many other better love stories than this, I really can&#039;t see the overall appeal. It wasn&#039;t enjoyable to watch, and I shall not waste my time with it anymore, ever again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (5)<br />
<br />
Monogatari Emma, is just some sweet, innocent, rose-tinted but never too deep or dirty fluff, that&#039;s trying to imitate an actual, well-developed and memorable romace-story... while failing miserably. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not something that I would recommend to anyone, but... if you like romances, are a fan of the Victorian era, or if you just happen to have some time to kill, and don&#039;t really care, what you&#039;re going to see... I guess I can&#039;t stop you for pick this up and see it yourself. I&#039;m just saying, that... you really shouldn&#039;t!

    Emma: A Victorian Romance. The title of the anime speaks for itself. This anime is in fact an anime about romance blossoming in the Victorian age. Or the reign of Queen Victoria to be more specific. <br />
<br />
As said already, this anime&#039;s title is literally the summary of everything this anime has to offer. If you do not understand then allow me to explain : <br />
<br />
In the reign of Queen Victoria. Rich people are only allowed to marry with rich people. And poor people are only allowed to marry with poor people. All British people unite under one country, England. However, England is separated into two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330278">
        sub-countries. The rich and the poor. <br />
<br />
^ So following that. The story is about a rich man falling in love with a maid. Will their love ever bloom so much that it&#039;ll overcome the cruel laws &amp; obstructions of the world? Find out by watching, lmao. <br />
<br />
I...I don&#039;t really have a comment for this anime.. Other than the fact that watching this show feels like I&#039;m watching an animated reality romance from the 80s. <br />
<br />
Because it feels like reality. Sometimes it just feels bland and doesn&#039;t really give you the &quot;Ooh!&quot; reaction. Be that as it may, I never got tired from watching this anime. It was uniquely tranquil in its own way like Kino no Tabi. But better of course. If it wasn&#039;t then I would&#039;ve not given this anime 10/10! <br />
<br />
For those seeking for a romance drama anime that doesn&#039;t really have any climax but is still outstanding. This is the anime, my lads. <br />

    I love this show, it really does it in for a complete romantic like me. I can agree with some that say that the show is VERY slow, but that was sort of the point in my opinion. Love is rarely a fast affair, it takes time to blossom. I agree that with the ending it left a little to be desired, but for a two season series it couldn&#039;t have ended better.<br />
<br />
One thing I loved about the show was it captured Industrial Revolution Era London so well. The landscapes were great, the culture and population were diverse. It really put you in the time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363471">
        period. <br />
<br />
The music was pretty solid in my opinion, I liked the opening. The animation looks a little dated for over 10 years old, but I was not bothered by this.<br />
<br />
All in all, a great romance anime and a true hidden gem. Recommended to all romance lovers.

    i was kinda hesistant about watching it cause in my mind i was like this is gonna break my heart, but the more i watched it the less i cared about that and more for them. its a classic love story (like romeo and juliet) you sometimes wonder about some of the characters cause you dont find out too much about them , the story dreally focuses on their difficult romance but i still found it very heart wrenching.

    Emma - A Victorian Romance is not your typical anime about maids. There&#039;s no ecchi, no randomness, no sweat drops, and no high school shenanigans. It is a serious romance-drama, which is a welcome change from the usual anime subject matter. It is set in a realistic interpretation of Victorian Britain, with many historical allusions that only add to the depth of the world. Overall it feels like a bit of a mash-up of Romeo and Juliet, Cinderella and Pride and Prejudice: typical forbidden love plot between members of opposite social classes. Yet, while the story might be often told, the characters are lovable enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31803">
        to make the story seem fresh and enjoyable! <br />
<br />
For anyone who loves a period-romance (or costume-drama) I&#039;d highly recommend Emma - A Victorian Romance!

    Sigh, Now, that&#039;s how you make a romance anime, I&#039;m sick and tired of the crappy cliché high school romance stories, this one is gold, It was painful to see them part ways, I literally loved the show, I don&#039;t know what took me so much to start watching this, It was on my &#039;To watch list&#039; for ages now that it collected dirt,<br />
<br />
-Story 9/10<br />
As simple as it sounds, a love story between two people from totally different social classes in a world where states matter the most, the story stayed true to itself all the way long, the comedy was on point and not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282807">
        too forced, and that&#039;s where most of the romance anime fail.<br />
<br />
-Art 8/10<br />
The art style was weird at the beginning, but now I don&#039;t know if it was changed in these last episodes or I just got used to it,<br />
<br />
-Characters 9/10<br />
So many good characters, and of course annoying little brats (VIVI), there are lots of variety of different people, like Stevens, for example, although he&#039;s (what most people would say) a side character, I didn&#039;t view him as such, he stood out to be a great character, one of my favourites, lots of character development happened to all our main and support characters, the back stories were as tragic as they come,<br />
<br />
-Music 10/10<br />
Wow, just wow, never would have thought I&#039;d ever enjoy Music from the Victorian era, appropriate music for it fitting scenes, the emotions were so true and relatable<br />
<br />
Overall, It&#039;s a golden solid 9/10, I&#039;m curious what the second season has in store, I hope It stands out for an eligible sequel,

    Romance, yes it is. Emma, clearly says, what is love? How to confess and show affection? I&#039;m wandering, where to start and how to describe! Before moving to the core, I want to convey this, &quot;Emma - Victorian Romance is not for those who love action or comedy. The story moves like a gentle breeze but it have enough stuff to bring to the edge of your seat while watching&quot;. Let me describe one by one.<br />
<br />
First, the character designs are exceptionally well. Particularly, Emma, Eleanor, Vivi, William and Hakim and their expressions. Apart from that, the designers perfectly re-created the Victorian era.<br />
<br />
Second, the narration and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37033">
        dialogue are simply awesome. The dialogues like &quot;He didn&#039;t ask simple yes-no questions like others, but just seems to enjoy talking&quot; and &quot;I&#039;ll be waiting. Even if it isn&#039;t today nor tomorrow, I don&#039;t mind that&quot;. The story tells about the man-made classification between people based on their possessions and what&#039;ll happen, if someone dares to cross. The story starts with the visit of William Jones to his Governess Mrs.Stowner residence where he met Emma, maid to his governess and gets attracted to her then the rest are follows. Finally, an incident occurred which separated Emma and William.<br />
<br />
Finally, the most important thing, background score does well its part. Especially, the tracks, Emma, Menuet for Emma and the piano versions of Emma, Menuet for Emma, Silhouette of a Breeze are irresistible. Emma is one such anime that I recommend everyone must watch at-least once and feel the happiness and pain in love.

    First things first. My &quot;reviews&quot; system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.<br />
------<br />
<br />
✦Story<br />
What can I say. Victorian era London lovestory of clash between social classes. Workers and aristocrats. It was a sweet but tragic story, mainly as usual, because of a stupid cultural growth where Aristocrats think of themselves so much that worker class are disgrace. And thus the whole drama of this series. An aristocrat and maid fall in love with each other, but because of how world is built and how different classes relationships are frowned upon, their love story becomes challenged.<br />
<br />
This season felt somewhat of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291160">
        introduction and growth for characters. We learned about various characters, world and as well a little bit of their love story. It was a very sweet and classy path, but sadly enough in the end, didn&#039;t lead or branch as much as I hoped for.<br />
<br />
✦Art &amp; Sound<br />
Art and animation was good enough, but gotta say faces did look a bit odd. But on the other hand, I really did enjoy soundtrack in this Anime, it has presence, weight on emotions and simply well put. It was quite good, but nothing too amazing.<br />
<br />
✦Character<br />
Main guy, the Aristocrat who is quite kind, but whipped to traditions and slowly struggles with them and attempts to change things. He is a kind character, but his kindness is also  a bit of a problem at times.<br />
Main girl, the Maid who is as well kind, caring and generally quite a good woman. But on the other side, she is a bit too caring about everyone good will and should be a bit more selfish for her own happiness.<br />
<br />
Aside that, we have bunch of caring, supporting and in general quite nice characters. Including Hakim, who is oddly enough like some sort of a old wise sage that gives small push towards his friend. <br />
<br />
As well we have bunch of more stoic stereotypes, selfish aristocrats, greedy people and so on. So in a sense most of the characters very pretty enjoyable, fitting and almost all of them gave you sense of emotions and eventually as plot progressed, weight of emotions.<br />
<br />
✦Enjoyment &amp; Overall<br />
I did like it, sweet, sad, romantic and hopefully story will end well. Biggest complaint would probably be a bit odd art and a little bit annoying setting. Not been ever fan of selfish Aristocrats, but they are useful as plot device. As well I felt that a bit more romance and less slice-of-life would been much more enjoyable thing to have. But in the end, it was very good Anime, that I binge watched in one go with only 1 break inbetween.<br />
<br />
I really struggled whenever give it 7 or 8, but as usual, I have weak spot for romance and Anime. Thus I gave it higher praise.<br />
<br />
Point being, story is pretty emotional, calm, sad and sweet. It&#039;s a enjoyable ride of slice-of-life romance. Whereas touch of Victorian era is a nice thing to have.

    There is a lot of love stories that are set in XIX century. Some of them are good, other not that good.Japan also has a lot of stories that are set in this period of time. This is one of my favorite anime and manga and I want to share my opinion to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talking about the character development we can meet the main cast in this first season. What they do for the living and the environment they are: family, social status, etc. All characterrs are important and they are for something, no filler.<br />
<br />
<br />
This story develops in some point in XIX century, where customs, social

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413329">
        labels and even religion are very strict. If you weren’t born with money, at an early age you have to work, and if you are a woman… well, you know. Emma was very lucky to escape to this fate. Thanks to her guardian, Kelly, Emma can work and dedicate her life being a maid. Also, Kelly teach Emma how to read and write.<br />
<br />
The anime takes its time to develop the story and the characters in order to know each other and what they want. With the music and the good animation this anime is a piece of art. a hidden jewel you have to watch at least one time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Based in the manga of Kaoru Mori, the manga was animated by studio Pierrot. And the work made is really perfect talking about the setting of time, costumes, political and religious context, etc. Talking about the political and religious it isn’t that obvious but its not coincidence that we are talking about England of 19th century that is named after the queen Victoria.<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime is perfect if you like romance stories in this period of time. I won’t lie, the story is predictable about how the main couple will end. This first season ends in a really sad point, but a second season that promises us a continuation of the story of William and Emma will have a happy end.

    Emma: A Victorian Romance is a forgotten, hidden gem.<br />
<br />
Okay, I’m an anglophile. I love British literature and television, so maybe saying that Emma is a hidden gem is pretentious. This is one of my niche interests, so it’s natural that I’d gravitate to a late Victorian London setting, but it’s so rare to see this history so lovingly reconstructed in anime. There have been many recent hits that take on London as a setting, but many of them use the inhuman and supernatural to tell their story and draw you in. Emma, on the other hand, is a traditional romance that is grounded and realistic.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420281">
        With its focus on historical accuracy and lack of action, Emma won’t appeal to everyone, but it deserves to be given a chance, in hopes that other anime fans will add this to their jewelry box of anime hidden gems.<br />
<br />
Emma is a slow-burn romance, taking its time to let the characters drive it forward while the series explores the British social hierarchy, the system that deserves to be designated as the anime’s antagonist. The main couple, Emma and William, fall in love within a society that is represented through the anime’s visuals and side character conversations. The class divide romance is nothing new to entertainment, especially in British works. It’s been a theme for centuries - from Pride and Prejudice to Downton Abbey. Even though Emma’s premise has been done before and its social commentary is more overt, I never felt like it rehashed other works or felt like it couldn’t stand on its own. This is because Emma is very much character-driven, and the character writing is structured beautifully and integrates into the social background intelligently.<br />
<br />
The characters react to the conflict between the working class and the gentry. The side characters, such as Hakim, Mrs. Stownar, Al, and the Jones family deliver the context of the social setting that Emma and William navigate through. The couple responds to these realities with half-finished thoughts, flustered silence, and reserved actions about their love and expectations. They struggle in an internal conflict of whether to adhere to social expectations or to defy them in the name of love. Emma and William do not directly elaborate on their thoughts, because the society that surrounds them is clear as to why they can’t. Because this watch takes a lot of patience and understanding, some people may find this boring. But if expertly crafted character dramas are your thing, you’ll have a lot of fun with it as you watch Emma and William meet and face consequences for their love.<br />
<br />
As for the other elements of the series, the soundtrack is fitting. Emma’s music practically screams “British period drama,” as I am easily reminded of themes from British shows of recent memory. The OP and ED are entirely instrumental, and they stand on their own as pieces that both celebrate and critique the historical period. The music is quiet and soothing, and it nicely compliments the Victorian setting.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, depending on how you watch Emma, the animation and art have not stood the test of time. There is nothing wrong with the character designs or the backgrounds, as they are true to the original manga’s art and they look fine for an anime from the early 2000’s. Unfortunately, the animation shows signs of age thanks to screens growing too powerful for its current video quality. Thanks to the recent English release, there is a remastered version if you buy the Blu-ray, but most people who watch Emma will choose the cheaper streaming options. Don’t let this be a deterrence for you to watch the anime, as the story and romance deserves to be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Emma does have some flaws. It’s nothing that we haven’t seen before, the story does move a little TOO slow sometimes, and the animation quality hasn’t held up. Looking back at the character department, the Indian prince Hakim is one of the few characters of color and he seems exotic and romanticized in his appearance (when considering the historical context of the British Empire’s relationship with India). Some will find his external appearance problematic, but he has agency and is integral to the emotional development of the story, so don’t let him turn you away when his actions have meaning. For each shortcoming, there is something special to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Emma: A Victorian Romance is timeless and filled with charm, and it’s such a shame how obscure this anime is. This anime may not satisfy everyone’s taste, but if you’re looking for a good romance or are ready to explore what else anime has in store beyond the endless seasonal onslaught of shows, then look no further than Emma.<br />

    My first review. Slight spoilers ahead!<br />
<br />
Such a simple story line and very slow paced but it works, the plot is straightforward. It&#039;s about two people from two very different social classes fall in love with one another, but this kind of romance is unacceptable in a higher class society. I think its slow paced on purpose so viewers would have to pay attention with the character development and how the story flows. In a slow paced romance anime, you get to see the how the characters evolve and the anime invests you in every single one of the characters. It&#039;s nice watching the characters change

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350990">
        throughout the story while dealing with their feelings, struggles &amp; societal traditions.<br />
<br />
The characters and their realistic behavior was very understandable &amp; good to watch. With all the conflicts, drama &amp; unrequited love etc, we get to understand where the characters are coming from and you can&#039;t really blame them for feeling this way because of what they&#039;re taught. One thing I don&#039;t like about the characters is Hakim bringing his elephant, idk it just feels so stereotypical to me, there&#039;s no way in real life an Indian prince to bring his elephant in the middle of a London city road, its just unnecessary &amp; unrealistic in my opinion but I guess this is to bring a little comedy to the story.<br />
<br />
My only problem I have with the story is the ending and the two main characters actions at the end. Emma &amp; William take a while to speak to each other and it was kinda painful &amp; frustrating to watch especially with Emma running away from everything instead of confronting her feelings, but this trait is understandable &amp; realistic due to her upbringing &amp; surely being this story is in the Victorian era, women are taught to be a &#039;passive&#039;, I was screaming at Emma &amp; William for not saying sh*t lol.<br />
<br />
The art is simple &amp; fits with the Victorian theme, nothing too over the top or lacking, just simple &amp; clean. The anime captured the Second Industrial Revolution Era excellently, the surroundings were great to watch, the culture and types of people were diverse and the color pallet, I appreciate the historical accuracy, it really puts you in the time period. The animation quality is good but there&#039;s nothing more to say about it since the anime isn&#039;t action packed.<br />
<br />
As for the sound, the OST is bland, I don&#039;t feel anything from the music except for that one piano instrumental, no soul no flavor..... but what do I expect from Victorian music invented by white people? lmao. Appropriate for the setting but its just nothing special and the op &amp; ed song was boring &amp; not memorable at all, it sounds like stock music. The voice acting was good, idk what else to say about the voice acting lol. I wish there was an english dub for this anime, it would&#039;ve made my experience with this anime even better because I love watching animes with a western or non-asian setting in english dub like Black Butler, I think it will be very fitting with the whole setting &amp; feel.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime and its really different from other romance animes I watched, its more innocent and really wholesome. I wish more romance animes are more mature as this story. I also really love unrequited love stories so this anime gave me what I love. I really like watching the characters with unrequited love and those who come from such positions, making it their situation unfortunate is just entertaining for me (don&#039;t get me wrong i don&#039;t ever wanna be in this situation lol)<br />
<br />
Overall, This was really a good watch and I&#039;m glad that I watched this hidden gem! I hope the second season is as good as this. Its really underrated and this can be a good recommendation for non-anime watchers.
