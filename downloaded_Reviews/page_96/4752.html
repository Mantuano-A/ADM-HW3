    The anime was fantastic, yes the main character may might have been a bit villainous, but he shows his true self in the end. The anime is very mysterious, and it does have its fun moments, but it is a serious type of anime. I personally thought this was a masterpiece, and beats all the junk. Yes it was a bit repetitive in the middle, but it was all in the plot.<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10 and it is a must watch, if you think the main character is too &quot;emo&quot; like the other review, then DON&#039;T EVEN bother watching this.

    When a show is described as a &quot;hidden gem&quot; it immediately calls into mind something that you&#039;ve stumbled upon by happenstance with no prior expectations. These are the titles that come in and out of focus partially thanks to the presence of much more all-encompassing works made around the same time period. It&#039;s a common occurrence that spans across every medium but perhaps most notable in anime, where only a handful of shows per year are thrust into the limelight, while the rest are left to gather up dust and become yet another mortared in brick to support the weight of the juggernauts resting on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213002">
        top of it. These &quot;hidden&quot; titles were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Like in the case of 2015&#039;s superhero show Concrete Revolutio, which unfortunately had to compete for views in the same season that aired the much more popular One Punch Man. Or even self-indulgent titles like Sword Art Online, which ultimately received a far bigger viewer base than 2012&#039;s Accel World, an anime made by the same author, Reki Kawahara. Had these shows aired at a different time, the chances of it receiving better coverage could have been amplified, for better or for worse.<br />
<br />
And when it came to being at the wrong place at the wrong time, Argento Soma could not have picked a more unfortunate release date; being produced during a period where any title with the slightest use of biomechanics and distressed young pilots were quickly dismissed as &quot;Evangelion clones.&quot; This decade-long dark period also saw with it the likes of RahXephon, Brain Powerd, Fafner of the Blue Sky, Gasaraki, Brigadoon, Betterman and much more receiving that label for either legitimate reasons, or simply for the sake of grouping anything remotely similar under the same umbrella. Argento Soma was no different, becoming another statistic forced to carry the burden of that appointed buzzphrase. The reason for the label was pretty self-evident too, given the ominous aura that was ever-present throughout the mecha show&#039;s production; the pervasive nature of that 90s to early 2000s aesthetic that dominated all genres at the time, where anime entries were drenched in a pensive temperament, often dissecting itself and the broader storytelling landscape as a whole. This all served towards Argento&#039;s quick dismissal, almost being instantly forgotten upon arrival. But that&#039;s where the thin line of surface-level evaluations ended, as the show never stayed under Evangelion&#039;s thumb. Unlike the fate befalling some of its brethren like RahXephon, whom to this day still can&#039;t shake that &quot;Eva-clone&quot; label, Argento quickly grew into its own identity, taking a stance against its patriarch and choosing to draw from influences outside the medium altogether. Its statement may have been lost in the clutter, but for those that heard it—and more importantly—understood the bold proclamation; what they came to encounter was nothing short of an interesting artifact. To quote the words of the infamous ThatAnimeSnob: &quot;Argento Soma, is to me, a deconstruction of Neon Genesis&quot; and honestly, that&#039;s as befitting of a description as any. Instead of following the trendsetter at that time, Argento chose to challenge it in a way not seen before or since. Argento Soma is a &quot;hidden gem&quot; in every sense of the term.<br />
<br />
Starting off in a semi-episodic structure, we&#039;re introduced to our protagonist and residential edge-lord, Takuto Kaneshiro, who, like many others, found himself involved in a lifestyle where the military&#039;s far-reaching hand became a part of everyday life, thanks to an ever-present threat of alien invaders. After a series of unfortunate events, Kaneshiro took on an officer role in a paramilitary group called Funeral; a subsidiary of the army made for the sole purpose of combating the increasing wave of alien invasions. And as the fight against these extraterrestrials rages on, new information is slowly unveiled that changes not only the course of the battle but also humanity&#039;s stance on the perceived threat as a whole. <br />
<br />
The biggest forewarning that should be brought to your attention before viewing this is the choice of pacing. Argento Soma operates with a sense methodical arrangement, where everything is laser-focused to serve its characters and narrative, as it slowly builds towards its penultimate third act, where all its careful planning exfoliates into a much grander concept. A slow-burn that never concerns itself with side-show theatrics to maintain short-term attention spans, and as such, may require a bit of patience on the part of the viewer. It&#039;s the defining feature that separates sci-fi from hard sci-fi, Stars Wars from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Where the minutia of individual character involvement and the events of all things big and small are all held accountable; introduced with the promise of a return in investment. If pathos drove Evangelion, then Argento functions on precision. <br />
<br />
The benefits of this slower-paced first act can be seen with the metamorphosis of our protagonist, as well as the side characters that make up his surrounding environment. As already stated in the synopsis, Kaneshiro is motivated by vengeance, which gives way to a lead that&#039;s enveloped in a lot of mental grief and suffering due to his circumstances. He&#039;s possessed by this idea of &quot;getting even&quot; with the aliens that robbed him of normalcy and happiness, and it&#039;s seeing this very mindset mold him that brings a great deal of intrigue towards his growth throughout the series. As if donning a mask to hide his true feelings, we come to know Kaneshiro for a majority of the show by the alias Ryu Soma. An alias he chooses to adopt when becoming a member of the Funeral organization. But beyond the need to shield his identity, what&#039;s truly being put on guard is the person himself. Kaneshiro is in a state of denial about his shortcomings. Something we&#039;re made privy to as the veneer behind his actions slowly washes away, and he&#039;s forced to confront the true source of his grief. <br />
<br />
The first half of the show entertains a &quot;monster of the week&quot; formula but never places it center-stage to its true intentions: the character involvement and the grander concept that awaits them later down the line. In fact, it could be argued that the first half of the series is merely there to flesh out the world, give weight to the increasing alien threat, and more importantly, to add dimension to our cast of characters. In order to achieve this, the show develops its cast byways of a collective character study; a situation where the actions of one could indirectly paint a picture of another. Developments that come as a result of close-quarters interaction. And as all of this is being done, a slow paradigm shift from a character-driven story to narrative-based one is slowly being orchestrated in the background, as the show works its way towards the final thematic proclamation. One that makes broad implications yet remains intimate at its core. <br />
<br />
And while screen-time is evenly distributed to most side characters to help achieve this third act revelation, the primary focus is always awarded to Kaneshiro. Seeing his slow metamorphosis and growth as a character was quite fascinating. His brash and somewhat pigheaded persona never felt like artificial drama but was branched out from a place of genuine angst. There was a poignancy there, something that similar works fail to grasp. He&#039;s driven by a need for redemption and lashes out, not because he&#039;s justified in his actions, but because the moment he seeks for the answer through introspection, the truth revealed is far crueler than the scapegoat he designates for his revenge. He&#039;s drowning in self-pity, searching for any means of resurfacing. And seeing his struggle, contemplation, and eventual catharsis through acceptance was something well worth the price of admission. <br />
<br />
For those that have seen and appreciated Argento Soma, it&#039;s hard to fault the show&#039;s usage of deliberately slower pacing, as it&#039;s that very attribute that made its methodical reveals effective. But perhaps it&#039;s because of that that the show is practically unknown to a vast majority today. This isn&#039;t to suggest that the show had filler, but rather, it lets the narrative operate organically for far too long at times, even when it was done under careful observation. Ironically, the very free-flowing narrative that helped gave the events of the story a naturalistic expression is the same thing that contributed towards alienating its viewership. It was simply too long-winded for those that couldn&#039;t get behind this perceived &quot;slower&quot; pacing. This, as a result, has caused the few that have heard of it to either dismiss it altogether or shy away after getting wind of the unwarranted &quot;Eva clone&quot; mantra; a buzzphrase that offered a quick surface-level way to escape further elaboration.<br />
This anime suffers not because of the actual content but because of the audience that surrounded it. As condescending as this statement may sound, this anime is intended for a more refined viewer, someone that understands the fundamentals of proper storytelling and the need for carefully planned build up to give later events more substantial impact. It&#039;s the difference between a person taking the time to appreciate the fragrance and taste of aged wine, as opposed to merely swigging it with the intent of getting shit-faced. The difference is patience and consideration. And for a medium that is known for attracting people that seeks expedience, Argento&#039;s quaint methods places it at a disadvantage. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, for those willing to shift mindsets to accommodate this show&#039;s approach, it offers enough to justify its actions.<br />
<br />
For one, the show never viewed things through an ideological lens but chose to let the content speak for itself. This made decisions on the characters&#039; behalf to hold greater meaning. No one was ever &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; they were simply human, making decisions that they deemed to be the best one. This sense of moral ambiguity was shared among all characters, whether their role was of primary concern or held tertiary value to the plot. And since the leads were composed of adults, it paved the way for far more nuances in their interactions than what you&#039;ll typically get from an anime cast overpopulated by teens. Adults weren&#039;t simply nowhere to be found while adolescence ran around &quot;saving the day.&quot; This was a show that had enough decency and common sense to realize that including adults was not only appropriate but essential when it came to settling the moral dilemma of characters&#039; choices. There are no redheaded tsunderes or emotionally detached lolis running the day-to-day operations of the military, but fully-grown competent leaders that think before they leap. To sell the seriousness of a story&#039;s conflict, accountability should come before marketability. Teen protagonists may sell like hotcakes for anime, but that&#039;s usually at the cost of legitimacy towards how plausible a scenario could be. Sadly, this is something that&#039;s mostly lost in the clutter of many anime titles, where teens seem to be the only characters of relevance. But in a way, it&#039;s because of tropes like these that the cast of Argento feels so refreshing by default. Whether the creators were cognizant of this or not, their decision to have a cast where there&#039;s only one teen, while everyone else was either young adults or older, ended up working out in their favor.<br />
<br />
This is yet another defining feature that contrasts Argento from its patriarch. If Evangelion&#039;s relatability is with that of teens, then Argento shifts to the next logical step, cataloging sentiments meant for young adults to connect to. Teens blame the world, while young adults learn that taking ownership for their actions is the key needed to depart adolescence before entering the next chapter of their lives.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s differences like that where Argento truly shines. Where its autonomy from the &quot;Eva clone&quot; mantra becomes crystal clear. <br />
<br />
Beyond these strong narrative distinctions, the art and animation for Argento held up surprisingly well, as it contained fights that had a sense of weight to it, where the individual movements and the environment felt well-documented. From the swing of an incoming punch to gestures characters make under extraneous circumstances; every encounter was given agency. While there are instances where the show&#039;s age became apparent, it never got in the way of selling a scene. But perhaps the most notable inclusion was the striking character designs themselves, which looked like a crossbreed of sleek runway model-like postures and the lengthy stone-faced appearance of Gundam Wing&#039;s regulars; which isn&#039;t much of a surprise, given that Shukou Murase handled both Wing and Soma&#039;s character design work. This could also be seen with another Post-Eva work that he was involved in with Gasaraki. His aesthetic sensibilities are quite unique, taking anatomical body proportions and giving it a specific vogue-like neo-gothic edge. To get into specifics, the appearance of the main character was, for the lack of a better word, cool-looking. It&#039;s a type of blend between brooding and swagger that&#039;s rarely captured this well, but when done right, lead to some attractive creations. <br />
<br />
Where the character designs lost points for creativity was with the aliens themselves, which lacked variety, as it was relatively the same design with exception given to the one known as &quot;Frank.&quot; The show could have greatly benefited with a few more distinct variations than the carbon copy lineup that was offered instead. While it could be argued that that decision to keep them all looking the same was made to correlate thematically with the show&#039;s &quot;big reveal&quot; towards the latter half, finding a way to work in more creative liberties to how they looked was still something that they should have entertained. Another issue that would immediately jump out at you was the characters&#039; noses, or should I say, the lack thereof. If Escaflowne is infamous for its Pinocchio schnozzles, then Argento stands as its antithesis, sporting the Michael Jackson look whenever someone is facing the viewer. Thankfully, it isn&#039;t a jarring feature for long, as the problem subsides the more you watch it, similar to the effect Escaflowne had with its initial viewing. <br />
<br />
The show&#039;s soundtrack was a mix-bag of melancholic songs, all synchronizing under the same dreadful feeling that loomed over the entire series. And while the soundtrack served its purpose well, tonally the genres were scatterbrained. They were unified under the pensive tone each had, but that&#039;s about it. The opening theme captured the essence of the title quite well, having a bittersweet swooning vocal passage carried off by the swelling rise of the instrumentals; a balance between sorrowful pitfalls and hopeful ascensions. The same cannot be said about the ending theme, however, which was quite jarring and far too bushy-tailed for the sobering tone that the series gave off. It was as if someone started playing the Bee Gees &quot;Stayin&#039; Alive&quot; during a funeral session.<br />
<br />
Outside of a few minor nitpicks here and there, the show does have its fair share of issues outside of pacing (for those bothered by the idea of slow buildup), one of which was its decision to name things in a manner that feels entirely too superficial. You see, Argento Soma was Sunrise&#039;s not so subtle attempt at patterning specific name and events after a classic novel, and in this case, that ended up being Frankenstein. But outside of the first episode, naming the found alien revived by a mad scientist &quot;Frank,&quot; and having facilities and organizations named &quot;Morgue&quot; and &quot;Funeral,&quot; there was very little that paralleled the classic novel and film itself. Instead, it&#039;s safe to say that the show only superfluously borrowed these titles, and had it been changed to anything else, nothing of significance would have been affected thematically. The usage of these titles should be treated as more of a motif than anything with symbolic annotation. In short, ignore the relevance of these titles. Just as Evangelion&#039;s theology symbolism was nothing but window-dressing, so too is Argento&#039;s need to reference Frankenstein no more significant than an artistic choice. <br />
<br />
Naming aside, perhaps the most significant issue that the show faces has to do with the involvement of a character named Mr. X. Unlike the harmless usage of name choices, Mr. X&#039;s participation brought with it damaging plotting issues. This wouldn&#039;t be any more of an issue than what&#039;s usually found with most shows, but for one that operates with such precision, the inclusion of such a wildcard ended up jamming the cogs of what&#039;s been up to this point, a highly-functioning machine. Given how problematic his involvement is, I would save all of this for the spoiler section. Thankfully, not even the issues found with his inclusion could diminish the show&#039;s third act revelation, something I will also save for the spoiler section as well. <br />
<br />
With the first half of the series being dedicated towards the character and narrative buildup, it&#039;s the second half that the series began to strut its stuff. With carefully foreshadowed moments that started peeling back new layers to the plot, and characters growing alongside the story to match it, everything started to come together, as the reveal placed the show on a league of its own. It stepped out of the realm of usual anime fodder and took cues from cinema instead. All of its careful planning and character fixation was finally brought to fruition. The mysterious fog that hid all agendas had finally lifted, leaving nothing but the naked truth of the show&#039;s secrecy to be laid bare for the audience to see. With the revelation of the third act finally being unveiled, humanity, as the show comes to know it, was made humbled by the presence of something much more greater than itself. <br />
<br />
For those that have experienced what Argento had to offer, join me in the spoiler section as we discuss this in further detail.<br />
<br />
***spoiler section***<br />
<br />
What made the third act so great was beyond the theatrics of the event but what it came to represent thematically in the series. What it managed to set up, in the beginning, resulted in the last few episodes being what I could only describe as &quot;2001: An Eva Odyssey.&quot; It took the ingenious vision of Kubrick&#039;s film and pushed beyond its ending point by introducing a prologue that saw with it the genesis of humanity as a species, and the exodus of a new stage of human evolution into a grander sentient being. It literally and figuratively showed our limited understanding when brought face to face with an advanced species. Where humanity saw a brutal, uncaring race of otherworldly creatures, in reality, it was humanity that was the uncultured simple-minded species incapable of comprehending something beyond our current intellect. It&#039;s like a 2D person trying to grasp the idea of a 3D object. This plot twist even paralleled the journey of Ryu Soma as well, which made it a multifaceted reveal that serviced both the narrative and the characters involved. It&#039;s an idea that could have easily crumbled under its own weight but manage to pull it off with such gravitas. And since Argento had already committed to making its content as grounded as possible, the potency of this reveal was amplified even further. This isn&#039;t to say that Argento tackled the idea to the pedigree reached by Kubrick&#039;s magnum opus; far from it. But the fact that it even took the idea and ran with it was awe-inspiring within itself. It&#039;s honestly one of the most spectacular latter halves I&#039;ve seen from any anime, period. <br />
<br />
But outside of this achievement, the show does have a significant plot hole that hurt it towards the end, and that was the involvement of Mr. X.<br />
<br />
David &quot;Mr. X&quot; Lawrence is by far the worst part of the show because, with his involvement, poor planning or split decision making on the part of the creators was immediately exposed. Earlier in the series, Mr. X was introduced as a sort of &quot;devil on the shoulder&quot; character that seemed to only exist in Soma&#039;s head. With his red hair, devilish features, and constant consumption of apples (obvious forbidden fruit reference), we as an audience was meant to believe that he was, in fact, a figment of the protagonist&#039;s imagination. But due to what I could only describe as a poorly executed retcon, this character was introduced as a flesh and blood human being that existed all along. Where the problem lies with that is that throughout the show, he was shown to have the ability to seemingly appear and disappear without anyone else outside of Soma acknowledging him. So when the reveal is made that anyone could have seen him all along, it rendered many instances of him appearing out of nowhere (from what we were shown) to be utter bullshit. One could argue that because of Soma&#039;s borderline delusional state, he simply couldn&#039;t follow Lawrence&#039;s movements and that his high-tech skills allowed him to evade cameras and personnel easily, but that still leaves the question as to how and why others were incapable of seeing him up until the point of the reveal. This was sadly a plot hole with close to no proper explanation given, but one I chose to consciously dismiss given everything else that the show had executed well in regards to the &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; third act, as well as Ryu Soma&#039;s character arc. That doesn&#039;t stop Mr. X from being a problem, and it&#039;s for that reason that my score was ultimately lowered. But aside from that point, nothing will take away that feeling of being awestruck that came about from the show&#039;s final act. <br />
<br />
***end of spoilers***<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never been one to care about the average scores accumulated by MAL users, but below 7 for this show is criminally low, perhaps being one of the most underrated and undeserving ratings given to any series I&#039;ve stumbled upon in the medium up to this point. Sadly misunderstood, a show with so many layers that it effectively deafened itself to the general populace. And rather than take the time to decipher its themes, the quicker solution was to subject it to semantics and label it as an &quot;Evangelion clone.&quot; Ignorance is bliss, unfortunately, that comes at the cost of things of greater value being dismissed by the collective out of convenience. <br />
As a fellow anime enthusiast, I saw this at the right time, never once being bothered by the episodic first half or the methodical pacing that it chose to contain everything in. With intriguing characters and a plot that slowly revealed its hand, the more I watched it, the more engrossed I became. The protagonist was one I&#039;ve seen done wrong so many times before that finally seeing his type done right was quite rewarding. Very few protagonists struck a chord with me in the way he did. This was a show that only grew on me as it went along, and after episodes 16-18, it became an addiction I couldn&#039;t stop watching. It was modest, never once flexing its accomplishments to obtain any further appraisal. It simply told its story and let the viewers that took the time to understand it to take from it what they will. It&#039;s that kind of quality that I actively seek out in media. And it&#039;s that very reason that Argento Soma won me over, flaws and all. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
This title is not for the impatient. For those that enjoy and understand the need for carefully planned build up, the payout is satisfactory, but for anyone else seeking instant gratification, you shouldn&#039;t bother with this. I don&#039;t like to advocate the saying of &quot;you&#039;re not ready for this show yet,&quot; but in all honesty, sometimes that&#039;s just the case. This is a show that could only be appreciated by certain viewers past a threshold with their experience exploring the medium. One only accessible to those well-versed in titles of now and those of yesteryear. To truly know the legacy, the lineage, the very building blocks that make up its foundation. But perhaps more importantly, it requires a mindset that&#039;s moved beyond the &quot;critics before art&quot; phase. To receive what this show has to offer is to approach it divorced of any pretense, of any conceit. Humility is a must. And as a viewer, until you&#039;ve gotten past these crossroads, I suggest keeping this one tucked away for a later date. I can&#039;t promise that you&#039;ll receive the same level of payout that I did, but I can assure that anyone in the right mindset to accept what it has to offer will, at the very least, be given something deserving of the price of admission.

    This Anime was almost dropped. There are some problems with this show and they mostly revolve around the primary character Ryu .... err sorry Takuto is his name in the beging and this guy is an exreteme emo! He is a victim and he wallows in it. I won&#039;t go into his reasons for victim hood, but I will say that he starts as a emo and ends as one and I get the feeling he would be a wife beater. Needless to say, I greatly dislike Ryu. Fortunately, he is not the only character, more on that later.<br />
<br />
Aside from Ryu, there is another annoying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1535">
         aspect of this show, the music. Music was by Katsuhisa Hattori, a famous and accomplished  composer / conductor.  Argento Soma is a military show, based in the US, so they used military style music, kind of. It was more like music from a military graduation ceremony. Maybe in Japan, that is what they think of when they think of American military music. I don&#039;t know, but it didn&#039;t work for me.<br />
<br />
But wait, the show is based in the US? Well, that is different and I like different. Also it is a military show, meaning adult characters, something else I like. In fact there is only one child, Hattie, in the show and she truly acts like a kid. Wow, an anime that realistically portrays the characters! Now, don&#039;t get wrong here, all is not peachy with the characters. Yes you already know I dislike Ryu, the others are likable but a bit shallow. After a few episodes they become fairly predictable but there are some surprises toward the end, so yeah, it&#039;s okay. They really take the edge off of dealing with Ryu and any one of the characters can carry a single episode with ease.<br />
<br />
There are more things to like fore this is a Giant anime. Giant Mecha, Giant Aliens, and a Giant Robot. Yeah, the Mecha are pretty cool, the design is nice, and I really like the flight conversion, they are pretty unique although a bit underpowered. The Aliens, well they all look the same, but react differently, too bad they have no personality. The Giant Robot, Frank, I think he is the real star of the show. Frank is just a big bruiser, to fix things you just run up and hit it. If that doesn&#039;t work, hit it Harder!  He also has a thing for young blonds, go figure.<br />
<br />
Now the story. You have Giant aliens landing on earth for an unknown reason. The military is helpless to combat them. A special force is formed with advanced mecha to fight the aliens. The name of this force is NERV....... no no no it&#039;s Funeral....  Heheh, okay so the basic story is pretty much a rip of Evangelion without the religious overtones or teenage angst. But there is Ryu, he is full of angst! He is Shinji all grown up and he is still a whiner! Still the story does heavily borrow from Evangelion, transplanted to the US with Pilgrimage Point replacing Tokyo. It&#039;s okay though, there are no EVA&#039;s attached to extension cords, at least  not really, there are no cords and the Mecha are not really EVAs , for the most part that is. Oh, yeah, and the ending is completely unlike anything in Evangelion, in fact it&#039;s pretty different and unique. Which is why I am glad I did not drop this anime.<br />
<br />
Over all, it&#039;s Okay. Ryu is nauseating, the music is bad and the story is formulaic, yet I held out to the end and that is saying something.

    Upon finishing Argento Soma, I finally understood why mecha+philosophy anime fans don&#039;t talk about this show often beyond them many simply assuming it would be another Eva-clone. Once you understand the core premise, see the introductory episodes and realize what the show wants you focus on, it&#039;s clear that, for better or worse, Argento Soma is actually a rather humble endeavor.<br />
<br />
The Premise&#039;s Promise:<br />
<br />
You wouldn&#039;t think so at first. In reality, Argento has one of the more gripping opening episodes I&#039;ve seen in the post-Eva mecha genre. It has all the right ingredients to be spellbinding: Our main character, Ryu Soma, who already struggles to understand

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218628">
        those close to him, the villain alien enemies are appropriately mysterious, and enough mysteries are set up to hook anyone who enjoys their drama to have build-ups, moments of calm/reflection, rinse and repeat.<br />
The setup features a highly intelligent and adaptable main character who suffers from a wide range of emotional issues anyone can relate to, ranging from Empathizing, Narrow-minded conclusion making, and an unhealthy amount of Self-Absorption. Normally such a character would be deemed &quot;dangerously unstable&quot;, but since the first few episodes take the time to be delicate with presentation, it&#039;s actually not too far of a stretch to say that he becomes our sole motivation to finish out the show. Several of my colleagues, ZephSilver and ThatAnimeSnob, have labeled this show a deconstruction of Evangelion (TV series); when it comes to its utilization of the protagonist I couldn&#039;t agree more. Shinji Ikari&#039;s docile, reactive nature has always created enmity and controversy in Eva across anime fans, and even fans of Eva itself, thus having Ryu Soma just as damaged but amazingly more attractive (both aesthetically and behaviorally) is impressive.<br />
<br />
Thus, the greatest aspect of Argento Soma is in his plight for revenge; revenge for preventing him for closing off one of the greatest opportunities he was so dedicated to see through. Ryu Soma, who would otherwise be a disposable sub-villain in another show deemed to be killed off because how obsessive he otherwise is to higher serving plot, actually grows in this show. Nuanced, self-learned, growth. Watching such graceful attention-to-detail for this take on revenge is not just welcome but inspiring and a definitely worthy enough to recommend the show all from this merit alone.<br />
<br />
The Price of Admission:<br />
<br />
But what causes the most gripes after these introductory episodes? Patience with the rest. You see, Argento Soma is not the first Eva-inspired anime, let alone the first who managed to tweak the approach successfully, but it does take the longest for it decide and stand sturdy on its own identity - the surrounding world building and mythos the show has; by the time we realize what the show wants to actually say, it simply happens too soon for the maximum effect to hit the audience as it should.<br />
Indirectly, this is because of how loose the pieces are put together. Unlike the more recognizable mecha anime like Eva, RahXephon, Macross, and Escaflowne, there just isn&#039;t a sense of culture to the setting. For example, the supporting cast; They are looked into of course thankfully, but not nearly to the same degree as Ryu. Not even into the main heroine. We see a bit of their past, but not nearly enough to clue us in as to why they live how they are in the present or possibly where they want to go in the future; an effect not unlike a bait-and-switch fashion. A general who might seem career-oriented then has an episode specifically built around painting a more sensitive side that otherwise throws her initial persona out the window instead of building on top of that.<br />
This creates a huge void of conflict between the characters when this post-apocalyptic, military-minded setting would suggest otherwise. Everyone other than Ryu it seems has it all together compared to him; not only does this create this odd air of naivety in how the writers want to portray secret alien fighter&#039;s mentality, but it reduces clash with Ryu and his journey - at least, to a degree where we realize they simply don&#039;t have as much interest or impact.<br />
<br />
And this applies to the setting too. Even though this does take place in the Unites States, certainly interesting alone. You would never think so while watching it. There is nothing indicative of American culture rubbing off on this in any way. They don&#039;t visit any cities, discuss or bring up any stereotypes (even if just for sake of using the culture), nor do any characters have any traits that can identify as such. This is eventually touched upon as serving the plot more later on, but again this is assuming someone has the patience.<br />
<br />
Is it Worth Watching?:<br />
<br />
But enough of about the composition, let&#039;s talk about the rewards for finishing Argento Soma, the outcome, the part where the show does decide to take its pieces and decide an outcome: Is it a successful venture? Ultimately, yes. In deciding to gamble a simple approach in the post-Eva world - something that benefits from merging together multiple plot threads and character motivations, Argento Soma&#039;s thematic delivery resonates as would a fairy tale: Pure hearted, earnest, hopeful... but ingrained from an anticlimactic standing.<br />
It resonates upon main character Ryu Soma&#039;s long-standing conflict beautifully otherwise mitigating the anticlimactic timing in how late the big answers are given. My heart accepted the message, but my mind could only lament in how this show was created ill-timed. Such a fairy-tale rendering of its conclusion would work better in a pre-Eva mecha world, but at least the creators did not let that hinder their ambition to see their vision through despite the lack of polish.<br />
<br />
Production Quality:<br />
<br />
Now onto some aesthetics. Sunrise did a pretty respectable job in animating the combat scenes, the plot mostly uses episodic monster-of-the-week battles but definitely does not skimp on the numerous ways the heroes combat them. You won&#039;t be watching this show for the action, but at least you won&#039;t be bored during battles either. What is rather boring are the alien designs... or should I say &quot;design&quot;. There is pretty much one design used for the entire array of encounters. Yes, the later episodes do excuse it, but I could otherwise complain that the writing polished up everything in the planning stage.<br />
Animation is generally consistent; for moments of extreme intensity - detail is improved to strengthen.<br />
Actually, the biggest hit to the art are the character designs themselves. Although Shoukou Murase is a hell of a director (Ergo Proxy), his designs - especially here are warped and lazy. When characters look straight on, nose detail is just abandoned; hell sometimes mouths are just streamlined. Given that the show stems on its character drama, this is a huge distraction. I&#039;m not usually one to harp on technical polish, but it&#039;s especially bothersome considering his designs in Gundam Wing are rendered and animated with 10x more fidelity, over 5 years before this show, from the same studio, with practically DOUBLE the episodes. Just saying; done now.<br />
<br />
Closing Thoughts:<br />
<br />
On the whole, Argento Soma, when seen today, is something of an artifact, a dinosaur. Made in an era where most mecha shows had two seasons worth of airing whether they needed them or not, it also came from an era that used established and recent conventional storytelling to accomplish a serious-minded journey about restrained human angst, personal development surrounding anger and hatred, all capping off to a meditation on the quiet but undeniable power that is the human potential to understand and forgive. When I realized this anime was made by the guy who helmed The Bio O - a heavily Western-drenched atmospheric show that also dabbled in the pained, bruised human condition - this mecha anime is definitely a raw gem worthy of seeking out. Its sincerity and impact will definitely range from person to person, and double could be said about its plot structure&#039;s appeal, but when you&#039;re done you are left with an indelible memorable impression that can only humble the spirit inside you.<br />
<br />
Number Grades:<br />
Story: 6/10 - The Eva-inspired &quot;mysterious aliens invade earth for unconventional reasons&quot; are second to the personal journey of Ryu Soma. While the alien plot is addressed, the revelation&#039;s credibility simply strains the foreshadowing led up to that. Nevertheless, the plot holes do not damage the core appeal and power of the thematic resonation so the end result is bearable.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10 - Definitely not the worst looking show, however it soon becomes clear as day that the production was definitely more concerned with aesthetics than polished rendering. Quality will dip and rise which with whatever is needed for at the time. Infrequent switches like this will be jarring so it&#039;s important to bring this up.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10 - Serviceable yet uninspired, the soundtrack uses simple tracks mostly for delivering a scene&#039;s importance or mood. Thankfully, it doesn&#039;t dominate over the character drama (letting them carry the show) so it becomes a case of where the OST does the job and clocks out when done.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10 - While everyone gets an even-handed treatment, the real star of the show is main character Ryu Soma&#039;s character arc which is so magnetic, nuanced, yet eminently attractive that it bleeds out to every part of the show. Everyone else has their part to play but I couldn&#039;t help but feel that it was mostly in relation to his conflict and not their own.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10 - In viewing this show back-to-back, I will be the first to admit that the show&#039;s pacing was hindered by the monster-of-the-week format. Almost every episode has some sort of value so I can&#039;t readily dismiss any episode as filler, but at the same time, I know full well that this didn&#039;t need to be made with 26 episodes. Good news is, from a point on, enough plot details are dropped to have the show gripping again so when the show gains momentum it generally shows effort to uphold it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.5/10 (rounded up to 7 on MAL) - An imperfectly realized gentle and graceful tale of all the positive hopefulness the creators have for humanity, part of me respects the entire show for never stooping to outright silliness to see this through. There are certainly more polished, gripping, complex, and even rewarding mecha dramas like this out there in this diverse quirky medium, but few play the humble card, and even fewer conclude with it resonating with such conviction. To that end, Argento Soma is a worthy experience in my book.<br />

    Argento Soma is as pretentious as it gets. Inspired by EVA and the like, this show is another old mecha garbage, full of plotholes, with a mess of a pretentious ending, not thought out at the start of the series. I don&#039;t like writing bibles that wastes people&#039;s time, so here we go:<br />
<br />
Plot is, in essence, a very obvious attempt at trying to cash in on the EVA train. Every episode, we&#039;re introduced to a new alien , the mechas take care of him, episode ends. Sound familiar, right? It&#039;s called the monster-of-the-week formula, and corresponds to 70% of the show. Very unoriginal, boring, slow-paced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review384859">
        (probably because they were stretching it out tbh). But the truth is, no one talks about those episodes, because they mean (mostly) nothing to the plot, apart from the fact that all aliens&#039; paths converge to the same point (familiar right?). Almost all the discourse around Argento Soma rests on the beggining and ending of the show, which infuriates me. MOST episodes are boring and unoriginal, and I do not recommend it to anyone who values their time.<br />
<br />
I will be discussing the ending next, so there will be spoilers. I do encourage you to read it because this is all the show has to offer and you&#039;ll have to sit through 18 horrendous episodes to get to it. So, SPOILER ALERT. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s begin the spoiler section:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll individually dissect each part of the twist : first, the pilgrimage point (as in, the point where all aliens were trying to get to), is the house of the first austronaut to ever leave the solar system, Yuri Leonov. First of all, it boggles me that this was a mystery in the first place. Does no one in Funeral know his address before? Did no one do any basic research? I don&#039;t understand why, in 2059, simple information like this is not available. Also, why didn&#039;t they go there? The place isn&#039;t guarded by the military at all.<br />
<br />
Second, and this is by far the coolest par of the entire show, Frank is Yuri Leonov, the same astronaut from before. Yuri Leonov, after staying adrift in space, encountered the land of the fairies, a place where beings that transcend our notion live. After encountering those fairies and becoming one of them, he returns to earth somehow (isn&#039;t explained) as Frank, the big robot that helps Funeral fight aliens. And the fairies (aliens they were fighting) are the ones trying to rescue him to return to the land of the fairies. This is super cool but is very sloppy as a lot of things weren&#039;t explained and may well be my interpretation, since it leaves so much unclear. How did he come back to earth? How did the fairies know where he lived when he was still human? If he is an astronaut, why did he behave so irrationaly at the beggining of the series? Such points are left uncleared and unanswered, probably because this twist was thought after the fact.<br />
<br />
Third, Mr.X, the unknown man that helped our protagonist to change identities and join Funeral. Oh boy, I have never ever in the history of anime encountered such a gigantic plot hole my entire life. They were setting him up as a mysterious character that was CLEARLY intended to only exist in soma&#039;s head. He teleports and disappears, leaves cryptic messages and has a lot of religious imagery attached to him to represent a devil. That Mr. X turns out to be Leonov&#039;s friend called David Lawrence, who should&#039;ve been house arrested. So, you&#039;re trying to tell me that he was never caught in any cameras, no one else saw him ever, nor checked his house to see if he was actually confined? No explaination given at all in any of this points. This exposed exactly what this show is: a quick, uninspired, pretentious, sloppy attempt of storytelling. This makes me believe that this entire &quot;twist&quot; planned afterwards, which is dissapointing as most of the show is a slow paced and boring generic mecha garbage. Final rating is 3/10 and it is in parts due to this, as the generic mecha garbage deserve around a 5/10 for me.<br />
<br />
Minor Nitpicks that stack up to lower the grade:<br />
<br />
- episode 14: Harriet escapes a military facility and they struggle an entire episode to find her, despite having cameras everywhere.<br />
<br />
- episode 2, strange focus given to Harriet&#039;s pingent, only to never be brought up again<br />
<br />
- animation gets pretty sloppy at times (inconsistency of faces), OST sometimes fails to meet the tone of what&#039;s on screen.<br />
<br />
- conveniently Soma&#039;s girlfriend (Maki) looks the same as Harriet and as Leonov&#039;s wife, which is essential for the plot to work. Also Harriet and Maki sing the same song (?). Kinda cringe tbh, as most scenes of Maki usually are.<br />
<br />
- The Aliens all look the same (to save budget lol) as also does the mechas, dissapointing considering the character designs look so unique.<br />
<br />
- Deus-ex Machina in the form of the excalibur to kill one of the aliens, there are others but that one stood out to me the most.<br />
<br />
- Why does Soma think Frank killed maki? He was trying to save her, even in his memory it is pretty clear that Frank didn&#039;t even get to touch her, she died because of the base collapsing, not Frank.<br />
<br />
END OF SPOILERS<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
<br />
This show is, at heart, a boring monster-of-the-week generic mecha anime with edgyness. The ending is dumb and pretentious people will try to tell you otherwise.

    When people say this is a hidden gem, they aren&#039;t exaggerating. The air time slot and DVD release of this in both Japan and the Americas was poorly timed and this series got overshadowed and forgotten because of it. <br />
<br />
This I would say is the closest thing to being a proper implementation of what Evangelion was after without the meandering plot and loss of focus that troubled EVA during it&#039;s later episodes. If you were at all disappointed by the way EVA handled itself later on, then this anime does a great job of picking up a very similar concept and follows through without needing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330347">
        a movie or OVA to wrap it up.<br />
<br />
This anime focuses on its storyline and the effects war and service have on people. It&#039;s a very serious tone, and deals with a naturally unlikable main character. But this I feel kind of plays well with the rest of the cast as it lets the viewer focus on the full cast rather than staying involved with a singular character. It plays the unlikable protagonist character well, and does a great job of pacing the story, and developing it&#039;s entire cast with a believable progression, while still keeping strongly to it&#039;s sci-fi setting. It is a good example of the &quot;Unlikable Protagonist&quot; story and writing element.<br />
<br />
The series pulls directly from Shakespeare, Russian and US Army inspiration,  and delves deep into the psychology of loss, and the tragedy of war.<br />
<br />
The sound and soundtrack is fantastic and has many unforgettable themes that stick in your head long after. Silent Wind, the &quot;Nior&quot; Theme, Wonderful World, and other tracks are easy to remember long after because they are so distinct and well composed. Though the ending theme is very odd and overly 90s cliche and could have been much better it&#039;s one of the only disappointments of the series.<br />
The English dub is also very good, and is one of the few examples of very well thought out and very well played and performed dubs. IT&#039;s close to Ghibli level, not exactly, but very close.<br />
<br />
The art style however is a bit odd and uncharacteristic of the time frame, and anime as a whole. While it pulls from it&#039;s 90&#039;s origin, it takes a significant strive away from standard expectations and leaves undefined features contrasting with overly defined features on the same character. It gives the show a distinct style unique for anime. It&#039;s strange at first, but it grows on you and plays very well with it&#039;s visual story telling.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, they were unexpectedly well focused on military details and getting them correct. There are things in the anime that are real parts of the US Military. Things that I expected any animator to just guess and replicate, they instead got accurate with a small waiver of artistic liberty. They even got the PX Military exchange shop correct. That&#039;s a really minute detail that most people will definitely miss.<br />
<br />
The show wears its military, Russian, and Shakespearean inspirations on it&#039;s sleeve and plays out much like a Drama play, and there is even an additional OVA that goes over the history of a fan favorite character(Sue Harris).<br />
<br />
It&#039;s clever, smart, and explores tough subjects and hard to face realities.<br />
I would definitely recommend this if you&#039;re into heavier themes, and harder to deal with subject matter. Any one with military service in the US will appreciate the military detail as well.

    Some anime fans have condemned Argentosoma as another &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion clone.&quot; It does bear some similarites, especially when it comes to the mechas and the secret that lies beneath their armor. Otherwise, they&#039;re two different concepts. The scenes and dialogues in Argentosoma are much more serious, while in Evangelion they are often sprinkled with comic relief (like those funny faces) and &quot;fan service.&quot; The actions scenes in Argentosoma are often much more intense than those in Evangelion. My favorite aspect of Argentosoma is the character design. It is less &quot;kiddie&quot; and the protagonist, Ryu Soma, is probably the coolest and sharpest looking anime character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144921">
        ever animated. I recommend this series if you like mecha-themes, and especially if you haven&#039;t seen Evangelion.

    Argento Soma is about Takuto Kenishiro, a young man who is offered a chance to get his vengeance on the monster he blames for destroying everything and everyone that he cared for. To get this revenge he is reborn as Ryu Soma and joins Funeral, a military organization that deals with the aliens that attack the earth. <br />
<br />
My thoughts: <br />
At first, I didn&#039;t think I would like the anime but it was surprisingly good. The animation was superb, the characters were likeable and the ending was surprising as well.  It wasn&#039;t expected at all. This is an anime I would recommend watching.

    Fairly droll for the first dozen of so episodes by at around episode 18 it starts to move, emotions set in and things go somewhere.. worth watching, don&#039;t let the lack of action and fairy land stuff put you off, it&#039;s a short series, stick with it.

    This is a wonderful anime. It is NOT like EVA. Keep reading and I&#039;ll tell you that this anime is not just entertaining, but full of amazing human relationships, and has a beautiful, satisfying ending. Yes, it takes some time to get to the &quot;serious&quot; action, but the character development is wonderful. Like one reviewer said, don&#039;t let the &quot;fairyland stuff&quot; turn you off--it&#039;s not what you think. <br />
<br />
Most of the reviews for this anime (and there aren&#039;t many) are not complete or are incredibly unfair in how they portray the story. I have a feeling they watched this show with only one eye open

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132661">
        (or didn&#039;t finish it). Otherwise, it was not their cup of tea. I have no idea why--I loved it. Here&#039;s my short, yet succinct, review:<br />
<br />
What it IS:<br />
<br />
The musical score AND Shakespearean stuff is lovely and flows throughout the whole anime. There is a balance of tension and beauty.<br />
<br />
I LOVED the main character as he was complex and atypical (or should that actually mean normal, as all humans are unique and complicated?). Hattie, or the girl with the &quot;annoying voice,&quot; as some said, is actually a great voice actress and plays the part of a traumatized young girl perfectly (it is not cliche). Her character development, like Soma&#039;s, becomes more and more noticeable and enjoyable throughout the story. The relationship between these two becomes deep, heartrending, heart-wrenching, and redemptive.<br />
<br />
Artwork is classic--there may be a couple sloppy scenes here and there (not very noticeable), but on the whole, like Trigun, there is some pretty fantastic hand-drawn stuff. The main character&#039;s appearance changes (as his character changes--you&#039;ll find out why) and becomes really gritty and awesome. He is definitely someone we can all identify with...You really can&#039;t take your eyes off Soma. He&#039;s just ghostly cool and unpredictable.<br />
<br />
The ending is fantastic. That&#039;s all I&#039;ll give you, as you really don&#039;t want any spoilers for this show. The surprises are all great and weave into the plot amazingly. Look for details. Rewatch value is pretty high.<br />
<br />
What is it NOT:<br />
<br />
It is NOT like Evangelion. Just because there are flying machines, &quot;aliens,&quot; etc., does not mean it is like EVA or is trying to be. Argento completely stands on its own. And we don&#039;t have any obnoxiously angsty teens who are crying the entire time toward a horribly bizarre ending. The main character in Soma is incredibly complex and develops over the entire story line--and matures in realistic ways. My guess is some people gave up this anime after the first few episodes without taking the time to see what happens.<br />
<br />
The only disappointments for me:<br />
<br />
The only thing I would agree with is that the story gets slow for a few episodes in the middle,  but then seriously speeds up and takes off (probably around episode 13, imo). There are some moments of awkward dubbing, but (this is actually a positive) the lead actors are great and are now considered veterans of the anime world. It&#039;s fun to see them in their earlier works. The only thing I could have wished for more of was Soma--even though we saw a heck a lot of his character. I ended up loving his character so much that I was sad the series ended. I guess that is another positive.<br />
<br />
Fun Facts:<br />
Crispin Freeman plays Lt. Dan. Fun to listen to him voice act in an older work. You can tell he&#039;s not totally in &quot;Crispin mode&quot; yet.<br />
Soma is voiced by Stave Staley who plays Moondoggie from Eureka 7.<br />
A certain mysterious character (won&#039;t give away here) is voiced by the actor who plays Legato from Trigun.<br />

    First of all, DO NOT start watching because you liked the promo photo. The protagonist in the anime has very little to do with this intriguing and mysterious guy. He is, in fact, a whiny child with no goals and no basic thinking abilities. Someone ready to panic for no reason whatsoever to the point of being ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I am not sure what was worse in this anime - the Swiss-cheese-like plotholes or the mostly-abysmal characters, who acted with no reasoning, so let&#039;s say both. <br />
<br />
I am still struggling to understand what this was all about - was it love or was it aliens?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256459">
        Anyway, it was ALL very bad. <br />
<br />
The screenplay is terrible. I have watched the anime on double speed and still had some moments, which dragged on endlessly, needlessly.<br />
<br />
The story began with a walk through the lives of two (supposedly) genius students and quickly turned into a sci-fi mess with &quot;superbeing&quot; elements. One of the students was fascinated with the other. We, of course, were in the dark why, while the other student was very attached to her professor. We, of course, were once again not informed or shown what made him so great. <br />
<br />
Later on, we met a little girl and her grandpa, then moved in with a super-squad fighting the super-bad aliens. Suddenly, our protagonist appeared with a new name and a brand new background, and guess what - we had no idea how this happened and what part of the new story was reliable (if any). <br />
<br />
In episode 20, few somewhat new heroes appeared and the story finally began to make sense. Why, oh why they had not chosen a different protagonist or at least given us some background on the key characters? This would have helped save this mess or at least would have added something to grab on to. <br />
<br />
The final battle was also a useless effort, as none of the characters ever grew on me, so I could not care less what was happening to them. <br />
<br />
The end was disgustingly stupid and came out-of-nowhere. No background, no reason for any of the events shown or the relationships demonstrated. <br />
<br />
The final nail in the coffin was the &quot;soma&quot; itself. One would think a word, so pretentiously used in the anime title and as a very prominent alias would mean a lot, wouldn’t it? No. I would not disclose any details, but this “subject” was shortly mentioned as something VERY important at the beginning of the series only to reappear shortly in a newspaper article and never to be mentioned again. Ever. Did the anime creators forget about it? <br />
<br />
The storyline was a mishmash of many different stories, which collided at some point and got badly mutilated in the process, leaving us with nothing to see and no one to care about. <br />
<br />
Admittedly, the opening and ending were beautiful. <br />
<br />
Still, avoid this anime at all costs. It is poorly made, boring and lasts far too long. <br />
<br />
TL; DR: Do not watch this, it is not worth it. Characters are weak and uninteresting or totally undeveloped. The storytelling is sloppy and full of plotholes. People calling this anime a &quot;hidden gem&quot; are either devoted hipsters or actually meant &quot;jam&quot;.

    At first I thought this was going to be an EVA clone, but it isn&#039;t really.  I had actually dropped it after the first 2 episodes.  I picked it back up and finished it a couple years later.<br />
<br />
The majority of the episodes consist of the para-military organization &quot;Funeral&quot; defending earth from alien invaders with their mecha.  Meanwhile the understory consists of Takuto&#039;s desire for revenge against Frank (the monster/hero created from the parts of defeated aliens).  Things get quite a bit better once you find out &quot;why&quot; all the aliens are trying to reach the same location on earth.<br />
<br />
The storytelling itself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96995">
        is sub-par, and character development is lacking.  It still turned out to be a decent enough show to watch.

    [This review is spoiler free!] TL;DR: Bland art, characters, fight scenes, and everything else that makes a good anime. All in all, a waste of time. <br />
<br />
I have seen a lot of reviews calling Argento Soma a hidden gem. It&#039;s not. <br />
<br />
For 14 episodes, I sat here and stared at a screen blankly. The neutral colors, lackluster fight scenes, angsty and whiny characters, and bland story makes for a bad time. The only reason I stuck around for so long was because of the positive reviews on this site. I can tell by episode 14 that things are starting to pick up, however, I have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378809">
        lost any hope of my future experience being worth the 5+ hours I&#039;ve already committed to the show. <br />
<br />
The main characters; Takuto Kaneshiro and Harriet Bartholomew, both know a solid 2 words between the two of them. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if half of Takuto and Harriet&#039;s lines were &quot;Maki!&quot; and &quot;Mr. Fairy&quot; respectively. When those are the type of main characters you are working with, you start to worry for everyone else (and rightfully so).<br />
<br />
Plot-wise, I have seen a lot of people compare Argento Soma to EVA. As someone who hasn&#039;t watched it, I cannot either confirm or deny this. However if anything I&#039;ve heard about Shinji is true, Takuto (or Ryu, or Lt. Soma, etc) is definitely the same character type. Whether that is good or bad, that&#039;s what you can expect. In my own opinion, he makes for a shitty MC with his wishy-washy ploy for revenge. <br />
<br />
I will admit, though, that the concept of a alien with cognitive thinking was a very interesting one. Although, Argento Soma misses the mark on this greatly. It would&#039;ve been interesting to see more of an attempt between communicating with the alien instead of having the little girl constantly thrown into battle. Although it is obvious that the girl suffers from PTSD from a past I won&#039;t get into, her constant crying in each and every episode gets tiresome real quickly.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t help that a large bulk of the anime is spent running around in circles. Harriet hates the sounds of guns, gets tossed into battle, has the desire to run away and the alien helps her escape. Takuto hates the alien and hopes to kill it, uses the alien&#039;s escape as an excuse to engage in a fight with it, chickens out, and goes home. I can&#039;t say with 100% certainty that all the episodes are like that, but I can guarantee the first 14 are. <br />
<br />
There is honestly so little character development for the side (or any character in general) characters, it is disheartening. I could spend all day writing about the flaws on this show, but I don&#039;t want to dedicate anymore of my time to it. <br />
<br />
All in all, Argento Soma is a waste of time as a viewer. I don&#039;t know why some of the top reviews are people praising this show so highly. If anyone is curious in this anime or wants to watch it, I definitely recommend that you stop while you are ahead.

    This review will continually be updated as I *eventually* slosh through this series. <br />
<br />
I was set up for disappointment. Knowing what sunrise is capable of, ex: Geass, I expected a cool mecha story with some flare. The protagonist looks super cool. I decided to give it a go. Boy am I thoroughly disappointed with this title.<br />
<br />
Story: Argento Soma is the rip off of Evangelion with absolutely no budget. Except they somehow took Eva&#039;s initially confusing story and morphed it into complete garbage. Out of the blue we learn that aliens are attacking earth? It literally came out of the blue with no hints towards that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373478">
        being the case at all. I thought initially it would be a story regarding the exploration of the alien shot down and the struggle between humans and the alien. Buuuuuuut no. Fighting the aliens WITH and alien (looking at you EVA)... like cmon seriously? The organization &quot;Funeral&quot; is literally NERV with a drastic cut in funding. They even have rip off scenes of the MAGI computers and some chick that is supposed to be like Gendo?? like cmon. This story is complete garbage from the get go. The protagonist has NO reason to go as far down his &quot;evil&quot; path... like cmon... a girl that stood you up? This story has horrendous writing. I give it a 2 (Dreadful/Horrible).<br />
<br />
Art: The first episode had me. I thought this series might be something special. Well it was a lie. The aliens are all bland in color schemes and look muddied up (not in the good way like battle damage). Some of the characters look straight stupid like the cop in the beginning. I could literally look down at my toilet bowl after taco bell and see better art than this. It gets a 3 (Poor/Very bad).<br />
<br />
Sound: This music is absolute garbage. Music doesn&#039;t fit scenes. It all out of synch. It this series has awesome music it would be maybe even above average at a 6 as a whole, but alas this isn&#039;t the case. I don&#039;t even know how to describe the music. Just... Just no. It&#039;s like if toddlers tried to make military esque music. It&#039;s downright corny. It gets a 1 (Pathetic/Appalling)<br />
<br />
Characters: There&#039;s only one SEMI interesting character at this point in the show and that is David Lawrence. The amount of mystery that shrouds him as well as the way he talks in old literature is a breath of fresh air. He seems truly evil but like an angel. Sadly the rest of the cast is dog shit. Takuto is edgy for no reason, Harriet is an annoying little girl who believes in elves, Sue is a childish person who would NEVER make it into the US military (oh yeah, its also set in the US). FRANK.. Who&#039;s idea was it to name the damn robot Frank? I get that this work was supposed to be an extremely loose interpretation of Frankenstein... but naming him adds to the childish and utterly inconsequential nature of the show. Guinevere is hot and that&#039;s it. Michael is the stereotypical African American that the Japanese portray in the military, Ernest is just odd, and Lana is a wannabe Gendo. Characters get a 2 (Dreadful/Horrible).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Not much to say here. I truly love anime but its so hard to enjoy this show. It receives a 3 (Poor/Very bad).<br />
<br />
Overall Rating (incomplete): It gets a 2 (Dreadful/Horrible). I hope this show can change my mind.

    Not really sure what to make of this. It seems to change a lot over the course of the series and nothing ever really becomes that clear. It also has a main protagonist who is very hard to like, but unlike other such dislikeable leads (Guts from Berserk, Sunabozu from same, etc.) has nothing which really redeems him in terms of interest (other than his snazzy hair cut). I think it’s the murkiness of the plot that leaves me with a general sense of dislike for the series. While the major plot points are addressed (or thrown away in PLOT TWISTS!!) there is a veritable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22061">
        multitude of other issues which don’t get addressed. All in all this series just left me feeling a bit meh

                          I Won&#039;t write a long review. Argento Soma it&#039;s said to be slow. Well, honestly, i didn&#039;t care, and i didnt notice until the half way. The construction and the interior drama are outstanding, each character has its own complexity of motives, truly remarkable. <br />
                   The fights are pretty good. The art has some problems that, i think, come from the character design(too slender and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236709">
        no nose). <br />
                    In my vision, the only flaw is the final form of the show. What does that mean? Each episode is great, but the whole is not. What was the point after all? <br />
    (SPOILER)The message of understanding others doesnt fit. It was impossible since the beginning. Then we have the buddist shit of the will creating something, that doenst fit in the plot at all. Mr. X being actually the good guy is not a problem, but it betray the eden snake symbol. (END OF SPOILER)<br />
     So, in the end, the best option is: Hate is empty, redemption is all. In the end, this is a fundamental truth of life.<br />
     If you like mecha and good story, thats for you.

    Argento Soma is a Mecha  Military  Sci-Fi  Drama Anime from 2000.  I really don’t want  to rewrite the synopsis of the anime. <br />
<br />
The anime has a flawed main protagonist Takuto Kaneshiro who took the identity of Ryu Soma. The earth is facing aliens who are not well understood but all of them are moving towards a central point called The pilgrim point. The aliens are getting more fearsome and other story elements. People can easily dismiss it as an EVA clone due to similar tropes (which extends even  more than one expected) but Argento Soma is a much humble

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398266">
        anime from story , characters and art/animation point of view. It still manages to comprehensively tell its main theme extensively and along with other themes in a smart and enjoyable way. <br />
<br />
The story starts with Takuto Kaneshiro&#039;s story before taking on the identity of Ryu Soma sold by Mr. X to him. He becomes a member of Funeral, a special force to fight aliens. The story also introduces a teenage girl called Harriet Bartholomew who possesses a child&#039;s innocent attitude and believes in elves younger than her age. She turned out to be able to communicate with Frank and thus she has a role in the story. After the introduction , the story goes with a semi-episodic structure with monster of the week encounters and some progression as escalating out the situation , figuring out character interactions , seeing some flashback for Takuto Kaneshiro , figuring out some hidden information , creating visual motif like bullet and some few world building. There was an episode dedicated to political gathering from different individuals from the military and politics. I personally often enjoy such an episode because It is a way to show how the scope of events are bigger than the characters and how the situation has developed by looking at the individuals in charge. It even had a moment of questioning the premise of the story and how the situation has evolved to a no turning point. Of course there are some parts where they sounded just so stupid like clearly dismissing that the aliens are intelligent ?! The story picked its major plot point and detailed a major conflict and introduced a backstory in the last arc to conclude the story in the last 6 episodes. The last episode is an epilogue to the story. It is refreshing to see an anime with an epilogue episode rather than montage even if the episode quality is similar to fanfiction. <br />
<br />
 The story can be definitely slow to the majority of viewers because a major part of the mystery gets only solved within the last few episodes. Takuto Kaneshiro has a gradual character development but he can be aggravating because you as a viewer can clearly know his problem but he still follows a silly revenge desire towards a wrong target and escaping from facing his true problems. There is a lot of build up to events by foreshadowing even from the first episodes to the final confrontation. The anticipation ,which the story created to figure out about the  pilgrim point and goal of different factions, are bigger than any potential answers in the middle of the series.<br />
<br />
The last arc is satisfying from a thematic point of view as the story of the aliens are much closer to the major theme of the story and to the main character.  The story also introduced pieces in the middle of the series which got used to create a whole picture. The mystery is solved and the main cast of characters have to face incredible odds to succeed but there are still big elephants in the room. Mr. X has a very big role in the ending of the story while he lacks previous buildup as a character except being a manipulator  to make his involvement in the story more than just a plot device.  While the character had to face adversity, the only solution to the situation was for Frank to take action and Frank did but it was like a big magic spell casted by Frank to solve the situation.<br />
<br />
The story has some plot holes due to how the anime framed Mr. X in some scenes. Mr. X is a character who has a huge influence on the world of the anime. He can make Takuto Kaneshiro take on a new identity to enroll in a pretty sensitive position but he also appears as if he is a devil who Takuto Kaneshiro made a deal with to work as a spy for him. He can appear and disappear as the story pleases to the degree of other characters entering the scene but in split second Mr. X has completely disappeared. One could have assumed that he was a delusional creation of the main character but he couldn’t have become Ryu Soma by himself.  There are also other plot holes if one searches but they are not so critical. <br />
<br />
So let&#039;s tackle my last statement in the intro paragraph : “It still manages to comprehensively tell its main theme extensively and along with other themes. “.  The story has many themes and the majority of them are often explored by contrasting the characters with each other and with situations. The differences and similarities between characters&#039; motivations and their reactions to situations are what compliment the story themes.  Lana Ines and Yuri Leonov have more in common than what meets the eyes. Lana Ines and her interaction with her higher up are also enforcing other themes. Dan Simmons and Guinevere Green&#039;s different reactions with how to deal with fear of death are complimenting each other. Frank and  Ryu Soma have a common personal issue. Michael Heartland’s story about teamwork and military brotherhood actually fits  Ryu Soma and Frank&#039;s situation in the beginning of the story. The themes are built by interactions and situations , thus the story is enhanced by the themes rather than being disconnected.  The Major theme in the story is communication , interpreting intentions and understanding issues. It ranges from being one of the major character flaws of Ryu Soma  to the alien invasion and being unable to understand their goals. There is also a theme of temporary solutions which are willing to be taken by politicians for many reasons including saving face. <br />
<br />
So Do I love anime ? The answer is sadly no but the reason is strange. I actually didn’t feel like caring about the characters much and even some dramatic moments I was unable to feel invested but why ? The reason is that the characters can’t operate by themselves or be interesting individually. This isn’t really a psychological drama anime where side characters&#039; stories shine. The only character which can stand on its own is Takuto Kaneshiro even if his issues are obvious and he can really get on your nerves with his attitude. Takuto Kaneshiro is a cold individual who loved his girlfriend Maki who died in Professor Ernest’s experiment to revive an alien called Frank. Frank (frankenstein) consists of multiple parts of different aliens. He blames Frank for the death of Maki and wants revenge while the scene opens to the clear obvious possibility of Frank trying to save Maki ?!!! He questions himself later which is alright but yeah he isn’t as bright as us viewers from our comfort position. If you don’t have empathy for him, he will be the most annoying character XD .<br />
<br />
Ryu Soma is the major character in the story while he is also a fake character to spy on Funeral and this echoes with how much development we can see with other characters.  Ryu Soma is a character which doesn’t want to get involved with others much.  The other characters are pleasant to watch except maybe Dan and Harriet. The cast consists of responsible  adults and Ryu himself is competent but when I look at them with lenses : <br />
<br />
1- Captain Michael Heartland has no real depth to him. His personality is of a sensible moral and loyal person. He is a strategic support to the team.<br />
<br />
2- Guinevere Green is only a carefree character who lives her life to full while mentioning death often. <br />
<br />
3- Sue Harris, a mature person with a childish demeanor.<br />
<br />
4- Professor Ernest Noguchi is a true idealistic vision of a scientist. <br />
<br />
5- Dan has incomplete depth to his character but still has elements to make him more interesting to speculate. His action actually works as foreshadowing to other events. Btw his voice actor is Takehito Koyasu AKA DIO BRANDO.<br />
 <br />
6- Commander Lana Ines is actually a good character, probably my favorite in the anime. She is a character in a position done right for a huge part. Her story is simple yet effective due to the situations she is put in. For example , she questions herself about their fighting to keep aliens from the pilgrim point with a potential of losing her comrades without reason. She has to use Harriet even if it is morally questionable. She is pragmatic and flexible  while having a human/emotional side to her. She is way flexible/humble with Ryu suggestions and others. She isn’t really an innovative character but a fitting one. If the story builds more drama for her , she can be a major character. <br />
<br />
7- Harriet is a problematic character. She just fits to support themes and being a girl to force Ryu to question himself due to her resemblance to Maki and being about to request from Frank to do things.  I’m not fond of those characters but they are not inherently bad. She truly acts as a 6 years old child in a 13 years old body believing in elves and faulty interpreting good intentions from others sometimes.<br />
<br />
Having a cast of characters constructed to fit a role within the story themes or to take up a position isn’t a wrong approach. The slower pacing prevented them from being so bland because it gave them time rather than solving mystery in a rushed way, but adding more touch of drama to the characters can spice things up (the drama exists for them but the story doesn’t invest as much). The story also dedicates a lot of time to make Ryu Soma shine in action more than the rest in many encounters to build his credibility , yet It was the most refreshing when they had to deal with  the giant alien as a collective force. There are some screen times for side characters but I feel like a standalone episode can make a huge difference at how much they can make me invested. It isn’t a matter if there is a spice or not but a personal preference on how much spice you want in the anime.<br />
<br />
They are still refreshing for a huge part because the cast consists of adults and emo Ryu soma. They deal with trade offs and dilemmas within a gray area rather than with the notion of completely black and white morality. Commander Lana Ines was even direct in mentioning that in a dialogue. <br />
<br />
The anime uses language as a motif which gives feeling and weight to names rather than being an analogy to greater meaning. Frank, Funeral, Soma and Morgue are just names and this is alright. Frank might be a problematic one to some viewers because they might expect a greater depth from the name. This is more an issue with the viewer than the work in my humble opinion. <br />
<br />
If comparing an anime to another can be a death sentence then comparing this anime to Eva from a visual point of view is the closest to execution. The shot composition is alright and scene transitions are not confusing. The animation in fighting scenes are serviceable but not really a reason to watch the anime. The aliens design (a single design for all of them with some tweaking) is a double edged sword with a sharp edge and dull edge. The dull edge is that the design can be an element of surprise to Funeral as they have to figure out if they have information on the alien or not just for a few moments. One the other hand , it feels cheap and it gets boring starting from the second encounter XD.  SARGs (Funeral’s mecha) designs are actually cool and they are uniformal in look which fits military story but later in the anime , a new SARG model has been created but the only visual differences between the old and new design is the color swap !!! The character designs are distinctive from each other and the facial expression can still be deciphered. Those are the only positive things to say about character designs. The face can get pretty creepy because of the face proportions and how the nose can feel like a suggestion by the shadows. The character designs&#039; efforts are not distributed uniformly and some characters just look way different and out of place in terms of details and style.<br />
<br />
<br />
The music in the anime didn’t have an effect on me. It was neither terrible nor outstanding/unique to give a lasting impression. There are some tones which are distinctive because they are used in certain situations thus creating a motif such as Fragile Memory and Fatal One. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAE94t9gVsE <br />
<br />
My favorite music is actually the ending song Horizon along with the ending itself. The episode might end with a low note , sad moment , tension or whatever then the cheerful westarn style ending song starts XD . Ok there is a preview to the next episode which is done with a narration with a melancholic voice before the freaking cheerful ending song XD . The first frame of the ending song is a photo of Yuri Leonov smiling XD . I know that it might not fit with the ending of the episode but it gives so much energy back from whatever happened in the episode. The situation is getting worse , take this ending song XD .  The mission failed , take this ending song XD . You feel conflicted with yourself , take this ending XD .  You lost your loved one , take this ending XD .  <br />
<br />
In conclusion , the major strength of the anime is with how it constructs the themes with some methodical slow pacing in the beginning of the series with buildups , recurrent shared elements between cast of characters and situations.  The story is crafted well with elements of foreshadowing and creating anticipation for events. The scope of the story feels bigger than Funeral. The story is far from perfection due to some few plot holes and some plot convenience. The cast of characters has chemistry but they are subjectively lacking in certain departments to make me invested in them. The main character is the shining one but not the only one. The main character is  developed across the anime even if he can be aggravating because his major conflict is easily understood from the beginning. He feels like a stupid emo kid sometimes due to not change his false believes as fast as we viewers can see. If you can have empathy with him , the anime will become much more enjoyable for you. Putting this anime in comparison with Eva is unfavorable from a visual and audio aspect but the shared troupes between the two anime are probably the reason for the comparison to begin with. The story is told simply but it doesn’t mean that it is stupidly constructed.  <br />

Should you watch it ? Who am I to tell you ?!  Just read my opinion and others and think for yourself XD . <br />
