    Dear Japan: <br />
<br />
It seems almost every season, there’s one of those shows from your country that plays on fetishes or a rather bizarre sequence in the anime world. This time, it involves a girl and its….dog. Then, it decides for some odd reason to add the concept of scissors to the mix because we know it’s one of the dangerous gadgets suitable for “punishment”. As for the punishment itself, the receiving end is none other than our dog of the series, Kazuhito Harumi.<br />
<br />
Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyo (also known as Dogs &amp; Scissors) is an animated series based off the light novel of the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113255">
        name written by Shunsuke Sarai. For a series about books though, this show sure likes to play around its other angles. So now begins the story of a dog and its master. (one sadistic if I might even add)<br />
<br />
The show’s delivery essentially begins with its accurate delivery and promise. In fact, there’s a feeling of seriousness in the beginning. Our main male protagonist Kazuhito (a bookworm) is eager to read books and novels. As a fan of Shinobu Akiyama&#039;s works, he is determined to get the inside scoop of those words written in those text. But then one faithful day, the unthinkable happened. To be honest, if you thought your day was bad, Kazuhito’s day couldn’t get any worse because of what happens next. He becomes something he never thought he’d be and hence begins this strange tale.<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, the show takes itself seriously at first. The scene involving Kazuhito and his fate is depicted as brutal and violent with even blood added in the mix. The aftermath however turns out to be much more humorous when we find out that the woman Kazuhito gets acquainted with adapts a sadistic nature to her personality. Dressed in black clad clothing and armed with a deadly pair of scissors, Kirhime Natsuno is a woman that delivers the punishment to our not-so-lucky protagonist. Because of the punishment he receives, the show itself leans towards borderline animal abuse at many stances. Although it seems to be humorous at many cases, the series itself becomes intolerable after many of those repetitive moments. It doesn’t help by the fact that the dog also both intentionally and unintellionally provoke Kirihime at many occasion that results in those punishments. <br />
<br />
As far as the plot goes, the series sticks with its premise at first. In fact, it takes its turns early on to finding out the culprit responding for Kazuhito’s fate but more importantly to stick with its original plot. However, the series later on becomes a cluster of absurd comedy that makes little sense or no progression to the story at all. <br />
<br />
The story itself also consists of many characters although the majority of the cast consists of female characters of different nature. There’s a masochist, an idol, a maid, and even a yandere. These characters all connects to the tale of the sadist and the dog in some way although mostly depicted as complete nonsense. For instance, the idol (aka the Shining Girl) of the series known as Maxi Akizuki plays little role besides trying to take the spotlight while mostly failing to do so. Then, there’s even a yandere character that clashes against Kirihime in almost borderline incest moments. Other characters later on in the series also presents absurd comedy in different nature related to the concept of competitions. <br />
<br />
The relationship between Kazuhito and Kirihime is one of the more dynamic aspects of the series. Almost every episode focuses on them although the development between the duo is quite sour and sometimes way out of line. For the most part, Kirihime abuses Kazuhito at almost any time when she feels something doesn’t go according to her way or when the latter says something that shouldn’t of been said. However, if we look carefully, there’s also cases where Kirihime does treasure Kazuhito and vice versa. Even more so, Kirihime seems to get jealous at times for the dog and acts on those frustrations to carry out her punishments. As for Kazuhito himself, there’s a lot of humor revolving around his character with his new life as the dog. He doesn’t go out to hunt or guard the house but instead still follows on his goals to read books. Even as a dog, his determination seems to become avid as ever.<br />
<br />
As noted by its absurd comedy genre, this show doesn’t loosen that style any bit at all. The comedy of this show is ridiculous, as in ridiculously bad. Kirihime’s scissors is just one primary example as a weapon that’s out of this world with inhuman capabilities. Kirihime herself often acts like the boss but she shows insecurity of herself especially in regards to her female body structure. This gag is made fun of nearly every episode because of her small breast size. (assumingly A-Cup). It doesn’t stop there though because her physical nature is made fun of that result in undesired consequences for Kazuhito. This repetitive running gag feels almost like an endless loop at many occasions with the misunderstandings. Later on, a yandere type character also enters the story that formulates a triangle which spells out even more misunderstandings. There’s case of fan services from here and there although it doesn’t fall into the ecchi category. What it does fall under though is the seemingly endless and repetitive gags ranging from masochism to sadism to dog abuse. <br />
<br />
There’s some action as well but it’s mostly carried out in a comical fashion. The way the characters move and fight makes it clear at first but the transformations and execution is painful to watch. It tries to follow its themes involving the seven deadly sins as well but most of this is downplayed as nothing more than a textbook of mistakes. At one point, I question myself why I watch this show. Perhaps it might be the small chance of a decent mystery as briefly shown in the beginning of the show but this later wavers down with nothing more than nonsense once again.  <br />
<br />
Artwork wise, the term generic is what comes to my mind at first glance. Even the dog is portrayed as being generic with its design. He doesn’t look dangerous at all but instead of someone of frail nature. On the other hand, Kirihime’s design does look a tad noticeable with her black clad outfit. Her scarlet eyes and long black hair gives her a more dangerous look. On other hand though, idol characters, maids, and yanderes are designed in this show exactly what you might expect. <br />
<br />
The music aspect of this show is almost a joke like the show itself. The OP song &quot;Wan Wan Wan Wan N_1!!&quot; by Inu Musume Club is portrayed as comedy and does its job as such with its sequences. In the song, we see characters dancing while doing animal movements complete with some flashy outfits. The dog though? He’s there in the background usually suffering the abuse. The ED song doesn’t do any better either with bits of fan service and a similar style of its comedy genre. The OST is also hardly noticeable although we do see some of the more dramatic moments carried out in a serious fashion. Finally, I didn’t feel like any of the VA portrayed their roles in an outstanding way. The only noticable voice though might be the voice of Kazuhito when he was once human. If we notice carefully, we never get to see his true face. In other words, the voice of his character when he was human gives off a sense of realism in this ridiculous comedy of nonsense.<br />
<br />
For a comedy series, this show sure likes to play around with the genre; a bit too much perhaps. At many points, it feels like if you’re watching not just a parody but a series crafted out of nonsense. By nonsense, I mean nonsense as in making no sense at all while defying the laws of a decent story. The story itself also had a strong promise at first but breaks itself apart with its random gags and repetitiveness. In short, this show is one of those anime series where it tries to be “so bad, it’s good”. However, it just ends up with the first part as in ‘bad’. I know my expectations might be a bit high but being bad sometimes should have its limits.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, a disappointed viewer.

    Do you understand what is comedy?  Do you really value it? I am very sure you don&#039;t, not until you watch Dogs and Scissors. It is a series that will make you appreciate jokes, more than ever, because its pathetic, dreadful, and fan-service accompanied &quot;comedic&quot; plot will make you appreciate the math joke that you thought was stupid. <br />
<br />
The plot is simple..you can read the summary anywhere, so I am not going to detail that. But yes, this is an extreme story of books..where you either write or die..you read or die. That was the opening sentence of the anime. Quite interesting right? Yeah,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114347">
        I wish it was like that. Not until you pass episode 2, when you will suddenly realize the deep, thoughtful ways of this anime, thoughtful ways of putting fan-service. This anime is a collection of &quot;weird&quot; otaku fetish: sadistic tsundere, extremely attached younger sister, voluptuous masochist, and most importantly, a complete harem of girls. Not to mention the &quot;flat-chest&quot; jokes, &quot;those&quot; dialogues....and whatever a loner otaku dreams to see. <br />
<br />
At first it begins decently, guy loves books, he dies, and gets reincarnated as a dog to become the pet of his favorite author. And then starts the non-stop loop of &quot;flat-chested&quot; jokes, sadistic scissor scenes, younger sister pleading &quot;Kazu-nii&quot;, girls appearing to satisfy harems and ends with hot-spring bath and beach scene near the ending of the anime. This anime, without a doubt, will satisfy if you&#039;re into &quot;these&quot; things. <br />
<br />
Characters are simple. Protagonist is a straight-man (or dog) of the series, who gives commentary to every line spoken. He loves book more than anything. He is mostly in his dog form. The female lead (the scissor) is a 20 year old sadistic, flat-chested (where the jokes come from), tsundere and best-selling author, who although highly intelligent, limits her insults to &quot;perverted dog&quot; &quot;ero dog&quot; &quot;idiot&quot; and &quot;mongrel&quot;....yes, very intelligent insults she uses. <br />
<br />
Side characters include overly-attached imouto; a bookstore girl the protagonist loves;her younger sister who likes to &quot;play&quot; with the protagonist; a voluptuous and masochistic book editor; a maid who is overly attached to her mistress; a &quot;shining&quot; idol who is supported by overly attached men in black; and the girl who is always apologizing...and for comic relief afro guy, muscle men and whatever the anime industry needs to create comedy. <br />
<br />
Sound tracks are average. Opening song, you know those songs where the singer changes pitches as she sings..with hyperactive attitude? Ending is rather decent, after first ten seconds. And overall, very decent, low-average music. <br />
<br />
Art. Average 2013 art. Animation is decent, the fight scenes are alright. It&#039; just nothing to look forward to. And it&#039;s sad how every character must have colorful eyes and hair, certain types of figure and stereotypical appearance.<br />
<br />
Overall, I began this anime because of how frequently it was recommended. This anime was made TO satisfy the audience, especially the guy stuck in his room 24/7. There are plot holes everywhere, non-sense characters and low average art and animation. It just takes pathetic on different level. I didn&#039;t enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Recommended only if you&#039;re interested in &quot;those&quot; matters I mentioned, or just want to watch every anime of the season. Otherwise, just save your time on something better. Seriously, I cried realizing the depth anime reached these days.

    “Japan never fails to surprise me with their anime”<br />
<br />
Anime, without we realize has turned us into some people who likes weird things or even taboo in some society. We are getting used and even being desensitisized with japanese weird taste, Like ecchi that basically soft porn, incest that mostly all people in the world against it, and even turn us into a lolicon. Now, they even will make us turn into more weirder with the love between an animal and a human. Prepare for this?<br />
<br />
STORY (4/10) - Inu to Hasami is basically your generic of romance comedy anime with some harem in it. The premise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115871">
        of the story can be seen in MAL page. But its like what its said, its about a highschool boy who is being killed when he tried to save a girl and he’s being resurrected as a dog. Now, he’s turned into a pet for a girl that he saves before. Summary, this anime will be focussing on interaction between Kazuhito (the dog) and his master (Kirihime). The interaction that happen is not always about the romantic but also the funny. Usually, the jokes is about when Kirihime abusing her dog.FYI, she is sadistic and the punchline jokes that Kazuhito always do is pretty much makes the viewers at least gets smile or even laugh, though sometimes it isn’t funny at all.<br />
<br />
If you think the premise are absurd enough, then you’re surely surprise what will you find in this anime. In Inu to Hasami, you will find many absurd things that even you wouldnt think before. From absurd battle, wracky story, and furthermore, nonsense comedy. Its feel like you put many things into one box. But aside from that, Inu to Hasami is pretty easy to follow. Even the story is absurd but atleast you will understand about what this anime about. Though, its still absurd. SO absurd.<br />
<br />
Aside from all that aspects, Inu to Hasami is pretty enjoyable anime to watch despite of how absurd this anime is. The jokes is literally the one that keeps me still watching it until the end. Of course, there is sometimes that even the jokes isnt funny at all or even makes you wanna punch the character.<br />
<br />
ART (8/10) – Aside from the absurd story, the art in this anime pretty much well made and the reason why i still keep watching it until the end.  The art is so vivid, colorful and the background itself is pretty detailed. Like in Kirihime’s room, the way this anime draws the bookshelf within the books looks so realistic. Moreover, the colorful art makes this anime is more enchanting and didnt make our eyes being tired from watching it. Sometimes they using comical style, especially when it comes to punchline jokes from the dog aka Kazuhito. The art in the battle scenes are also quite good, The art drastically changes if the battle scenes were appear.From the colorful art they turned into more darker, the effects also is quite stunning and increasing the atmosphere of “battle feels”. But, from the drastically itself it can makes the viewers feel uneasy, though its great they can change the art style and madely well done. but it makes the art itself didnt consistent. However, the art is stil great.<br />
<br />
SOUND (6/10) – First from the soundtrack, the opening song of this anime “Wan Wan Wan Wan” by Inu Musume Club. This song is like the story itself, its absurd and didnt really catchy.  I always skip the song anyway, since the song is silly and not really attractive. But aside from my egoistical perspective, this song is suitable with the anime itself and really present the anime itself. But aside from non-catchy-music, The video music in the opening itself is quite funny and again, using comical fashion and some parody jokes this video is funny on its own way, even in the openin music video the dog is still get abused.Though the song is still bad..<br />
<br />
For the voice, the seiyuu in this anime is great. I mean, they really suitable with their own roles and characters personality. Like Yayoi that being voiced by Hiromi Agarashi, Hiromi Agarashi is really suitable for child role since her voice is childish and have cute tunes. Her voice is totally makes Yayoi is so loveable and makes you wanna hug her. But not just Yayoi, all the seiyuus is  also did their job very well, though sometimes the voice feels seems off.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (6/10) – First of all, i must say all the characters in this anime is unique. Its great to have so many unique person in one story. Great and unique characters are the key for making the story more interesting. But in this anime, they waste it all. Since this “all unique characters” are like the side dish. Well, i know this anime is focussing on those weird couples but still...  Those characters beside Kazuhito and Kirihime, its just like a figure. They didnt have any space for developments. <br />
<br />
For Kazuhito, he is a bookworm guy who loves book than anything in this world and like any MC in another harem that usually doesnt really care about their harem and also, dense. For Kirihime, she is a famous writer that being adored by Kazuhito and she is Kazuhito’s master. Kirihime is also asadistic girl that usually abuse Kazuhito. But despite of all that abuse, she also have a dere personality and quite caring especially if its about Kazuhito. Despite of all that, this formula is pretty common in romance comedy harem today. Dense main character while the heroine falling in love with him. Though the one that makes this anime is different is your main character is....... a dog.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION (6/10)<br />
Funny things about this anime is no matter how absurd this show was, but its still watchable. Though we still didnt used to see a Love between a dog and a girl is pretty hard to been accepted, but if you like beastility of course this isnt a problem. Anyway, since this is fantasy we can forget about the taboo and anything else and i find this anime is entertaining and pretty nice anime to spend time with, though dont get your hopes too high in this anime.<br />

    A dog as a protagonist?! Is what my reaction was when I first saw Inu to Hasami. And it made me think of how would the story revolve around that dog. So I tried watching it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never watched a series where an animal gets the main stage, so this will be the first one.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the story revolves around Harumi Kazuhito, a bookworm. He&#039;s a die hard fan of Akiyama Shinobu&#039;s books. One day he got into a cafe which was about to be robbed by a guy who didn&#039;t make any sense later in the story. The robber took out his gun and pointed it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118771">
        at the bartender. After seeing Kazuhito and another customer across Kazuhito&#039;s table, he told them to stand up. Kazuhito willingly follows what the robber said. While the girl across him didn&#039;t even flinch. The robber points his gun at the girl, ready to shoot. Kazuhito then interfered, and got shot in the head. Which resulted in him dying(duuh?). He&#039;s desire to read Akiyama&#039;s books didn&#039;t let him die, instead, he came back to life. Only its in a body of a dog. And that&#039;s where his story starts. Well, there were quite a few cliche things to watch out in into it, but fear not! Since its bearable and not that deep too. I think its because they wanted to stick on the comedy part more. No deep meaning, just your average comical series.<br />
<br />
It seems that every character in inu to hasami has serious mental problems, well I don&#039;t mean it in a bad way, since they were quite funny most of the time. And if you&#039;re looking for a cute dog, you definitely have to watch this. I mean, how often do you find a series which a cute miniature dachshund always hangs around. As if it that wasn&#039;t cute.<br />
<br />
Both opening and ending theme were upbeat, complimenting on how comical the story is.<br />
<br />
I believe that inu to hasami is a good series in its own way, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be bigger than what it has achieved by now. And it&#039;ll make me very happy to know if they decide to make another season. Since the amount of detail in the first one wasn&#039;t that good. So a lot of question will pop right into your head after watching it. But this series is a good watch, a comical series which doesn&#039;t have any deep story into it. Doesn&#039;t make you think how the plot will develop into. Just your average comedy series. Sometimes you don&#039;t need complicated whatso-shitty-complicated plot to be a fair series. There&#039;s not much to point out on Inu to Hasami so I&#039;ll end my BS here.<br />
<br />
(Overall Score : 8)

    Snips, snails, and puppy dog tails<br />

There are many anime shows out there. Some are serious, some are goofy, and some are both. Other shows enjoy dishing out ecchi, and then taking it away because it was all a trap to begin with (God, there&#039;s a lot of those). However eventually there is a show that is just really different. Bizarre. Plain weird. And just absurd. That show is Dog &amp; Scissors.<br />
<br />
It starts off simple enough as any other anime. It has a plot, and a reason. However those two get resolved pretty quickly, and then the show goes into Simpson-esc sitcom mode. Mostly because this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172059">
        show creates a mini universe type of feel. From a scarf wearing steroid user who loves to talk about muscles while jogging, all the way to an OCD pop model who loves to say &quot;SHINNY!&quot; every 2 seconds. There are a lot of weirdos to gawk at, at almost every corner here. The characters are mostly strange. Natsuno Kirihime is the most well rounded one here since she conveys more emotion than everybody else (Happy, sad, being evil, being crazy, being drunk, etc.). She does torture her dog (Kazuhito), however it is not brutal torture where she grabs her scissors, and digs into the dog (A sigh of relief for PETA right there). She just cuts his hair into weird shapes, occasionally threatens him, and calls him names. She has a good reason though. He&#039;s literally asking for it since Kazuhito resorts to making fun of her body all the time.<br />
<br />
Music in this show is pretty generic, but it gets the job done. The opening theme is pretty fun to watch. And so is the ending theme. The singing is not bad. However the instrumental part is the reason why it does not sound so special. <br />
<br />
The designs of the show are not bad at all. The eyes of all of the characters (Mostly the female ones) actually have a unique look to their irises, and eyelashes. Colors are spread around in the show giving off a nice palette. The backgrounds are standard anime protocol (Schools, cities, parks). However, back to the character design. A whole lot of them have a bit of a twist to the usual anime stereotypes (Mostly Maxi does, the &quot;SHINNY!&quot; pop idol mentioned earlier). And the animation is decent enough for an anime.<br />
<br />
On A Personal Note: This show is pretty unpopular. I understand why. I mean pretend that someone went into a restaurant, read off the menu about a chocolate cake with garlic in it being sold (With the ingredient &quot;garlic&quot; written everywhere). Then that someone ate the whole cake, and then acts shocked, and then shouts &quot;Why does this have garlic in it!?&quot; at everybody. Then another guy is there at the same place, at the same time, and that person ate the same cake. And then that other guy loved it because it had garlic like promised. That is how I feel about this show. Im the guy that loved the garlic chocolate cake. Before I even started watching this show (And Im not being all high, and mighty here), but I knew from the get go because of the description what I was going to get. And that&#039;s what I got. And I liked it. The show is not bad. Give it a chance. Expect it to be absurd. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not like the show is promising the moon. It&#039;s promising a crazy girl who has scissors, and a talking dog going off on weird adventures. And it delivers.

    Wan, wan, wan, Shinning!!!!!Ok, so...review time, time to give my ratings for each of this anime&#039;s category, Shinning!!!!!<br />
<br />
Story- fair 6, wan, wan, wan, wan.<br />
<br />
Ok, so the plot is very basic is like a beauty and the beast kind of thing except the beauty here, Kirihime- in terms of her attitude, is the beast and the Baxter,  (I&#039;m referring to the breed of Dachshund whom the male character is) Kazuhito is more like the beauty who is the damsel in distress where everyday living with her is like playing Russian roulette. Though the plot is always focus on them the comedy genre did function well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113293">
        with the two, however it becomes more of drag when the anime always focuses on their misadventures especially when Baxter (Kazuhito) is constantly struggling to not get into Kirihime&#039;s bad side, there are a lot characters whom where seemly being ignored and would have added more body to this anime&#039;s story plot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character- poor 3, awooooo!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m very much disgusted that Maxie Akizuki, SHINNNIG! and Himehagi Momiji&#039;s role were very limited, especially Maxie since her character would have added  more to this anime&#039;s comedy content that just limit her to a comic relief as for Himehagi Momiji , is also disgusted that she is just limited to a cameo role, also there is Afro and those muscle bums who would have contributed more to this anime&#039;s comedy. I really feel bad that studio Gonzo have to limit the mentioned characters a comic bit relief.<br />
<br />
Art, sound, enjoyment, overall- good 7 SHINNING!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I like the way that every character&#039;s here where illustrated, there is that certain sexiness without the ecchi and each of the character&#039;s here are perfectly designs to match each of the character&#039;s characteristic, though I&#039;m a bit disappointed that Kazuhito as a human wasn&#039;t given a face and instead the illustrator focus more the male character&#039;s dog designed (woof!) <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I like the way that Kirihime was played by Maria Inoue since she really did matched up as this sadistic girl that no man can mess with, also I like it that Kazuhito&#039;s VA played him as this pussy dog who is seemly afraid of what will his master, Kirihime will do next. Also, I like both the opening and the closing theme. But I&#039;m a bit disappointed that Himehagi Momiji was never given any speaking lines.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Though this anime may have some short comings, I&#039;d say that it was still SHINNING to be enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
<br />
Well, since there are indications of a possible season 2, I&#039;m gonna leave this part with just one remark......SHINNING!!!!!!!

    This is a story about books.<br />
<br />
Dog &amp; Scissors starts somewhat promising on its own terms. Nowadays you don&#039;t happen to see a story like this unfold and there might be a good reason for this, because it&#039;s condemned to be an unsuccessful attempt at creating something unique.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s acutally a story given to this series. The writer Akiyama Shinobu&#039;s trying to finish the last book of the collection of The Seven Deadly Sins. On the other hand the bookworm Kazuhito has a passion for every book and writer in the world, especially for Shinobu and he wants to read this last book badly. So badly, that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113215">
        the day he dies in a robbery where he protects a woman, he doesn&#039;t accept death and is resurrected as a dachshund dog. After coincidences occur he happens to live together with his favourite writer. The problem of the plot is that it&#039;s not going anywhere from that point on. Strange things happen and are resolved even stranger. The promise of an absurd and random comedy wasn&#039;t exaggerated, but it&#039;s just too random.<br />
<br />
The first three episodes always introduce new things and aspects. Jokes, characters and a random diversion of the story. After this the anime goes on repeat and all these things don&#039;t change a lot. This might feel like an infinite loop of repetition that finishes after 12 episodes. So the only thing to expect in the next episode is how they repeated old jokes again.<br />
<br />
Rarely the animation feels a little bit off, but overall the quality&#039;s good and fluent. At times there&#039;re even references to other animes and they&#039;re built in pretty well. The spectrum embraces cute illustrations with serious animation. Nothing more to say about the art here.<br />
<br />
Even less to say about the sound. The best thing about this anime is Marina Inoue and her performance, even though it&#039;s often forced at times that doesn&#039;t justify she&#039;s bad. She&#039;s awesome and a pleasure to hear. The OP song might be sinister, but I like to hear it and it&#039;s one of my favourites this season. Altogether the sound in the show&#039;s nothing special, though.<br />
<br />
The shiniest aspects of Dog &amp; Scissors are the characters and there&#039;re quite a few really singular personalities. But just because an anime has distinguishable characters won&#039;t make them any good or even likeable. So Akiyama Shinobu is revealed as Kirihime Natsuno, a 20 year old best selling author who lives alone and has a foible to torture other people with her scissors. Kazuhito ends up as a dog living in her apartment and even though he&#039;s a dog Natsume can read his mind. Why ? Because speaking dogs are terrifying, but however. There&#039;s about none character development ongoing and everyone seems to finish off as they were in the beginning. At last there&#039;s a really strange love story happening between them. I want to say see for yourself, but really don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
From episode to episode more characters join the story of those two. They truly differ as everyone has an unique personality, but most of this personality stays the same for everyone and is always the same in every single episode. It&#039;s like noone even wanted to give them proper development and thought this was a good idea. It was not. It&#039;s tremendously bad.<br />
<br />
You can compare the enjoyment of this anime to your enjoyment of eating really hot wasabi. It&#039;s a really small pleasure to watch this weekly in a season, but if I imagine to watch more than one episode at a time I&#039;d rather take the wasabi. This story was about books, but after watching it I don&#039;t feel any smarter or more educated about books. It&#039;s the opposite. I feel like I&#039;ve forgotten books I read because of the plain stupidity. If you enjoy bad repetitive jokes, strange and awkward characters, a story with no plot and/or love between humans and dogs this might be something to watch for you. <br />
<br />
Overall Dog &amp; Scissors&#039;s a bad example of a comedy in the big ocean of comedies. The strangest thing about it is the episodic structure like you find it in regular shows, but with an attempt to bring an ongoing story in it. So it&#039;s an episodic non-episodic anime and this could be good in a parallel universe where the issues of the story happen to be solved or revealed. In this one they aren&#039;t and there&#039;s a lot more better animes than this. Go watch them and don&#039;t bother with this failed experiment. If you already watched everything, you should rewatch Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. Still better than watching a grown woman wanting the children of a dachshund dog.

    An anime on Cruchyroll that looked to be interesting. <br />
<br />
*Story* - First 2 Episodes got me kinda interested, and it fades away more and more... Randomness<br />
<br />
*Art/Sound* - Art is ok. Meh on the ED. OP is decent. Although don&#039;t expect me to go out of my way to get the songs on my iPhone/iPod Music anytime soon.<br />
<br />
*Characters* - Ugh... If it weren&#039;t for some of the character designs, I highly doubt these bland characters would have a chance in hell to stand out at all.<br />
99% of they do gets repetitive BEYOND BELIEF! <br />
<br />
And even the majority side characters have no importance or any level of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113173">
        , which even questions why they even deserve to be in the Opening Sequence of the show.<br />
<br />
TBH, the ONLY character I was interested in was Sachi Moribe - The maid that was singing and is very loyal to her mistress. Anytime she was on the scene, I actually wanted to know more about her, which unfortunately never happens...<br />
And even Natsuno I cared about a little. The never-ending running gag of her having small breasts gets on my nerves. Because it&#039;s supposed to be a comedy bit even though its a constant dart to her character for no apparent reason at all. (FYI, her voice actor deserves way better than this. Especially since she did Yoko from Gurren Lagann...)<br />
<br />
*Enjoyment* - I find it to be offensively lazy, and offensively cliche&#039;, It feels like there&#039;s nothing that feels like I shouldn&#039;t forced myself to complete the series and dropped it earlier.<br />
<br />
I even feel like I&#039;m taking too much time on bothering to reviewing this. Especially this being my 1st Anime Review on this site.<br />
<br />
*Overall* - All of the things I critisized about this anime would possibly acceptable, if it either:<br />
<br />
A) Have long-lasting characters to latch on to even forgive whatever the storyline/plot was to be.<br />
B) Had the comedy effective rather than deteriorating into stale, overdone jokes.<br />
C) Had something that held an interest to balance out its own faults. That would maintain your attention on the show than doze off.<br />
<br />
So at the end of the day, I&#039;m not sugar-coating my criticism. If it gets to the point of a series where I don&#039;t give a flying dog crap about almost anything that&#039;s going on, Episode to Episode on in, then that&#039;s a big problem.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for an anime that contains the similar genres as this, I&#039;d prefer watching Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. <br />
Or if you&#039;re looking for a good comedy, watch The World God Only Knows on Crunchyroll.

    Well an type of Anime which i haven&#039;t seen in a while.<br />
<br />
Story 8: There is not much story behind it but what they got here is quite enough to make you laugh , say wtf and just enjoy the crazy ride.<br />
I mean come on how many animes do you find that involve girls and dogs and their relationship? Plus overall craziness with a depressing girl , masochistic manager and an over the top blonde girl showing up here and there not to talk about some samurai maid running wild making the dogs life even more crazy...<br />
And to top it up many random encounters , challenges

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113125">
        , embarrassing moments and everything that romance comedy needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 8: I am quite adaptive when it comes to art in animes and this one got that fantasy touch with lights here and there , magic circles here or there , at some point ninja effects like Speed moving or at times dark alleys , night times and everything just looked nice.<br />
<br />
Sound 8: I don&#039;t know i just don&#039;t care much for sounds in anime as long as the voicing is done good in which cases its done good most of the time and for this one the voices fit the characters and that is all i need.<br />
<br />
Characters 9: Huge variety: Very young and enthusiastic , teens , older people , even animals...<br />
Each got their own special skills like being an super masochist or depressed to the point of wanting to die and such.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9: I laughed and laughed and said WTF so many times over and over because that kind of love story was something i couldn&#039;t watch seriously!<br />
<br />
Overall 8: I give it 8 because its just a random comedy and i think comedy animes should never go over 8...

    Spoiler Free<br />
<br />
Story - 3<br />
The introduction and the given premise was fairly interesting, showing potential as it seemed to deviate from the norm. The first 2 episodes show promise but beyond this point nothing particularly new is introduced into the story (other than new characters) and the plot becomes highly repetitive. After about 1/4 of the way in, you can generally derive a pattern in the the sequence of events. <br />
<br />
I understand that this anime is a comedy but the lack of variety results in the humour going stale very quickly. Though it is generally lighthearted, the transitions into serious scenes are poorly done (or just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113163">
        pop up out of the blue) that you can&#039;t help but feel awkward watching things unfold.<br />
<br />
Characters - 3<br />
Nothing special or unique about the characters within this series. Most of them have only a single defining trait about them (ie sadistic, attention whore, insecure, masochist etc) that dictates almost if not all their actions and reasoning. As such, most events and interactions are predictable and repetitive.<br />
<br />
There is very little character development occurring as the series tend to focus too much on having characters stick to their one defining trait, and cases where characters do something more will often feel out of place and forced.<br />
<br />
Art - 5<br />
Mediocre. Nothing about it stood out, but nothing about it was bad either.<br />
<br />
Sound - 4<br />
The voice acting often feels strained horribly forced as if they&#039;re can&#039;t find appropriate lines for the characters, instead using whatever lines you&#039;d typically get in certain situations. Other than this, it is very standard.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
This anime has its funny moments, but they don&#039;t tend to last. The lack of anything outstanding or unique as well as the  many weak aspects of this series makes it easy for you to lose interest.<br />
<br />
I personally don&#039;t think this is worth the watch, there are many other anime out there that achieves the goals of this series, or at least performs better overall.

    Dog and Scissors had the opportunity to make something fairly interesting.... It had quite the unique plot, imagine if the dog could have occasionally turned human? see what I mean? Potential. Sadly he couldn&#039;t turn into a human and the anime exploded into a mass of small boob jokes and borderline bestiality/incest. The characters were actually DISGUSTING, they had overwhelming flaws which heavily outweighed the good making them static and truly just disturbing. Now not only does this anime have flaws with the characters but its plot? Just as bad. It starts off looking fairly promising, something fairly new to the harem industry but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118893">
        quickly become repetitive and extremely boring. (no joke I would have rather watched Haruhi Suzumiya&#039;s endless eight twice in one day) So real quick back to the characters:<br />
<br />
Kazuhito Harumi - the dog of the story. pretty much a bookworm forever alone, until he gets shot and turns into a dog of course. He is really the only (somewhat) enjoyable character in the entire anime, hit wit died at about episode 5 when he ran out of flat chest jokes; so from that point on he was pretty annoying.<br />
<br />
Kirihime Natsuno- hated this bitch. The dog pp lover from hell, she is sadistic and just generally annoying and at the same time disturbing. You will also find out she&#039;s not a total bitch but also a worthless emo who happens to be a giant waste of space in the plot&#039;s extremely small living quarters<br />
<br />
Madoka Harumi- dog&#039;s little sister; total bitch<br />
<br />
<br />
Suzuna Hiiragi- Worst character in this anime and that is REALLY saying something also a weird-ass masochist<br />
<br />
So yeah those are the characters, they don&#039;t compliment one another, they don&#039;t have any dramatic tension going on; nothing. They are just there, withering with the already dead plot. Oh yeah the plot! To say the least it&#039;s quite forgettable you won&#039;t remember it for very long, nor will you want to. It starts out with Harumi getting killed and reincarnated as a dog while trying to save Natsuno from a runaway gunman. Natsuno manages to find him in his dog form at a local pet shop and takes him home. From that point on in slowly introduces more terrible characters to make you hate the anime more like his sister and the weird masochist lady who&#039;s name has already (unsurprisingly) slipped my mind. Don&#039;t waste your time on this anime guys, it really is garbage sit back and watch something good; like Kill la Kill!

    I only started watching this on the first day it aired because it made me curious on it&#039;s title Dog and Scissors, and made me interested in it as soon as kazuhito turned into a dachshund dog. At first, the story revolves around finding who the killer was then after that I thought they would go investigate how to turn him back to a normal boy, but the story changed it&#039;s path. Their next goal was to make the last sequel of her book named &quot;LUST&quot;. And so it made me disappointed to see in the end that it looks like it&#039;s still not finished,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113254">
        it&#039;s like it lacks something, making it open for a season 2.<br />
<br />
The style of it&#039;s art was good, just like the other animes, the sounds too. The characters, I can&#039;t say anything special about them. Enjoyment? A little bit, you won&#039;t enjoy so much with this. So overall, it&#039;s just good. It&#039;s such a waste, I&#039;m expecting more out of it.

    To put it straight, I really enjoyed watching this anime.<br />
I love the characters and the art.<br />
The main character Harumi Kazuhito is a strange guy who is absolutely obsessed with books. It&#039;s all he thinks about!<br />
Then there&#039;s Kirihime Natsuno, the second main character who takes care of Harumi as a dog. At first she&#039;s the only person who can hear him. She&#039;s a super petanko S who loves punishing Harumi, and falls in love with him, although he obviously doesn&#039;t notice.<br />
Hiiragi Suzuna is Kirihime&#039;s editor and is a super M who absolutely loves getting punished by Kirihime unlike Harumi.<br />
Those 3 are my favourite characters in this

<br />
Scores:<br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
It was a good anime but is one of those that are really random and doesn&#039;t really have a solid plot. For example it&#039;s kind of like Sket Dance. I enjoyed it but was disappointed because it didn&#039;t really end properly. It looks like the ending is really rushed and it wasn&#039;t that good.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
I love the art in this anime, all the girls are so pretty<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
I didn&#039;t really pay attention to the sound, but overall it was pretty good<br />
<br />
Character - 9<br />
All characters have very different personalities, and it makes the anime much more interesting and in this case, humorous<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
Lot&#039;s of laughter and some feelings. I enjoyed it a lot<br />
<br />
Overall - 8<br />
Although I rated it an 8, it&#039;s still a very good anime and I recommend it to those people who want a good laugh.

    Seriously, I just don&#039;t even know what to say about this anime.<br />
<br />
STORY (3):<br />
<br />
So the story follows Harumi who protects Natsuno from the killer but in return he was killed and turned into a dog. So basically, this anime has a plethora of misunderstandings and wacky situations. I really thought that this anime is all about reading books but sadly this wasn&#039;t the case at all. This anime is all about random comedy. The comedy was not even funny. The story had potential to be awesome but on the 5th episode it starts to get repetitive and lost the essence of the entertainment. <br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113185">
        (4):<br />
<br />
The art was nothing special because a lot of anime companies now have improved their art and animation style. <br />
<br />
SOUND (4):<br />
<br />
There is nothing memorable about the opening and ending song.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (1):<br />
<br />
I feel ashamed to say that there is no character development in this anime. Even when it comes to Natsuno&#039;s &amp; Harumi&#039;s relationship. Their love story just goes nowhere. The characters never do anything productive and they just get very annoying. Let&#039;s take a look at the characters.<br />
<br />
Harumi Kazuhito:<br />
<br />
He is just a bland character who just tugs along with Natsuno.<br />
<br />
Natsuno Kirihime:<br />
<br />
I was pulled into this anime because of her. She sort of reminded me like Yozora from Haganai due to her voice and accent. By the way, Marina Inoue voiced Yozora &amp; this character here. However, in this anime, her character never gets better. She just treats Harumi like crap by cutting his skin off. She has no character depth at all unlike Yozora from Haganai. Seriously, she broke my heart. I thought that maybe her character development starts to kick in, but in the end I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Maxi Akizuki:<br />
<br />
Seriously, what was all this &quot;Shining, shining&quot;? Everytime when she appears on screen, she always says &quot;I&#039;m shining, love me please, I love attention!&quot;. After that, one of her guards dragged her away. This infuriates me a lot.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast range from annoying to bland characters. I am not going to list down everyone of them. The more I list down, the more I go crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
<br />
I just feel ashamed of myself for watching this anime. I thought that the anime might serve its purpose but sadly it didn&#039;t. This anime has no purpose. Normally, every anime has its goal and purpose in life. At least, this anime was not as boring as Amnesia. But I feel that this anime severely lacks in purpose, character development and a compelling story. <br />
<br />
Such a waste of talent for Marina Inoue. She did very well in portraying the voice of Yozora. <br />
<br />
For those of you who say that it is just comedy, I agree with your point. But that is just the start, and you need to develop your character to the point where the audience will get invested into them, and also the anime must serve its purpose well (i.e. compelling story) so that this will become a great comedy. But sadly, this anime never work on these items.<br />
<br />
I just feel heartbroken by how this turns out. Such wasted potential. <br />
<br />
I give this anime a 2/10.

    this is my first review :)<br />
with its serious storyline still made it funny..... <br />
<br />
when i started watching this i was first pulled in by a severe comical moment to be then sucked in by the protagonists main story suddenly things got extremely serious.... i was really suprised to say the least.... <br />
<br />
story: the story line was pretty good although i must say some parts completely confused me and i thought were a little unnecessary (for example the weapon the protagonists sister uses....) However i loved how the were able to blend a serious and comical storyline together so well and so abruptly. i do believe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117543">
        they couldve stretched out the protagonists background story and how he died a little more....<br />
<br />
art: they could have been a little more original i think that some of the extra characters have a great well developed personality but lack some artistic development and characteristics.<br />
<br />
sound: i think the music was fairly appropriate and i really enjoyed the occasional song as well as the opening and ending<br />
<br />
character: i was really astounded to find that the characters personalities were so unique and different to what i was used to from regular anime series especially natsuo (the scissor using sadist as her masochist editor/slave)<br />
<br />
enjoyment:asside from one or two episodes i really enjoyed this serie it wasnt to reppetetive and the background story was actually pretty good and the humour left me dying of laughter many times...<br />
<br />
overall: a really good serie i really enjoyed it and i think all of you will to. E specially if your a fan of random wierd humour .<br />

    This anime is so bad that i decided to make a review out of it. If you are a fanboy of this anime then i suggest that you don&#039;t read further.<br />
A warning, I may explain how bad this anime is with a few warnings nothing big.<br />
<br />
This anime starts of when the main character dies and turns into a dog. From the beginning that already sounds bad. This anime just has no story. The only resign why I watched it all the way was because I hoped that the story would at least get better, but it didn&#039;t. This dog man then lives with a girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213738">
        because she could read his mind. That just doesn&#039;t make sense.<br />
The story gets a 1/10 because it has no story.<br />
<br />
Art and music is the only good point of the anime. The dog is so cute and there is very colorful characters. This is the only high point of the anime<br />
<br />
The character development is so bad it almost made me cry. I watched all 12 episodes hoping, just hoping there would be some character development. There wasn&#039;t anything close except at the end were the girl wanted to marry the dog. The fact that she wanted to marry a animal is so disturbing. <br />
Because of no character development I will give this anime 1/10<br />
<br />
Overall the enjoyment is so bad because I find it so hard to enjoy this anime. I also find it so hard to believe someone used money to make this anime. This anime could have had potential.<br />
I give the overall score a 2/10 it deserves a 1/10 but because of the art i gave it a extra point.<br />
<br />
If you agree or disagree then let me know on my profile and leave a comment. I love hearing feedback.

    Dog and Scissors is an anime as the title states, it is anime about a dog living with a woman with penchant for scissors. It is anime that I believe the creators were interested in simply trolling the audience more than anything. It wasn’t a marketing push, it wasn’t fan service, it was simply unabated trolling.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Your initial impressions of this anime would be, so this is going to be a serious anime but then you quickly see how it becomes weird, pointless, stupid and ridiculous. Honestly, besides the first episode the rest become nonsensical and ridiculous, there is no story, it is nothing more than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232449">
        a bunch of plot holes grouped together to make each episode.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
You really think that the creators who created an anime to simply troll the audience would bother with art? Think again, nothing remarkable, not that anything could have been created to be remarkable with the premise of the story as horrible as this.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Other than to say there was indeed sound, nothing remarkable or good. In fact the sound made it worse. Don’t think it would have been such a bad anime if it was a silent one.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
I hate them all. I really do. They all suck.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I enjoyed when I stopped watching it.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
10/10 for trolling<br />
0/10 of being anything remotely watchable.<br />

    Dog and Scissors has to be one of the more bizarre anime that I have watched, on the surface appears like it is going to be a whole lot of trash, and believe me I gave my fiancee hell for buying it! But also believe me when I say that this anime is really good, and in a completely non-conventional way!<br />
<br />
The premise of the story is that Kazuhito, a HUGE bookwork, protects a young lady in a cafe from a hold-up by jumping in front of a crazy man with a shotgun, to have his head blown off! All the while lady is completely oblivious

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189430">
        to what has happened as she is crazily scribbling away!<br />
<br />
Kazuhito enters purgatory because he has something he has to complete in life, read the 7th book of the 7 Deadly Sins series by his favourite author, Shinobu Akiyama, and his desire to read this book is so strong that he is reincarnated...as a dog. PLOT TWIST, he is telepathically bound to the young lady that he saved, who just happens to be his favourite author! Who just happens to be a sadist!<br />
<br />
This is all the first episode, and from here, it goes in a loop of serious and funny!<br />
<br />
Without giving too much away, there is a very serious story going on for around the first half of the series, and then it goes a little haywire, but hey, its about a sadist author, and bookworm dog, and various other characters that are as crazy and lovable!<br />
<br />
This anime is worth a shot and definitely go in with an open mind!<br />
<br />
Natsuno (Akiyama) is easily my favourite character, and makes the story quite fun, she was really well done by the original producers, and the english dubbing is quite good to.<br />
Not really any character that I &#039;dislike&#039;, but maybe too much of an effort to introduce characters later in the series.<br />
<br />
All in all this series is a solid 8/10, and I am definitely interested in a 2nd season!.

    Story: story events only last about an episode with at multiple times conclusion of episode doesn&#039;t give a since of closure for what happens.Also any attempt at dramatic storytelling is counteracted by the silly things characters do or jokes they tell.<br />
<br />
Art: Dog x Scissor animation seems to have low production value with nothing in particular that looks detailed or pleasing to the eyes. even with the low production value it&#039;s still watchable with only a few redeeming factors .<br />
<br />
Sound:Most music is generic or not very memorable. The only thing that stood out was the opening which had somewhat catchy music. But the next time I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113355">
        watched it. It  angered me as What I once throughout it was funny but now I think its to stupid. <br />
<br />
Characters: The characters are over the top with most having some type of mental problem that border lines on insane with a murderous little sister a Suicidal bookish girl and a commando maid.<br />
<br />
Kazu: The most scene-able one among these characters is a dog who functions as the strait man for the series. He himself is an okay character even if his only desire in life is to read. Throughout the show he mostly only reacts to the thing around him and doesn&#039;t change much as the series continues on.      <br />
 <br />
Enjoyment: For this category i mostly enjoyed myself while watching dog x scissor with it&#039;s simple comedy good enough for you to chuckle or lol. But my enjoyment was hinder by the repetitiveness of some jokes and the logic bendingly ridiculous things that happen throughout the series.

    Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou review<br />
&quot;Painful barking&quot;<br />
There are always protagonists that separates one from the other. In this case, what really stands out is a dog as the protagonist. Welcome to the world of Dogs and Scissors!<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou follows the misadventures of Kazuhito Harumi, a booklover who consequently transformed into a dachshund dog; and Kirihime Natsuno, a sadistic yet famous book author.<br />
<br />
After watching the anime, I wondered if Kazuhito will ever turn into human again - guess not! But what did I get is that humans can actually fall in love with talking animals. Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is basically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118663">
        comedy with a tinge of romance. It&#039;s definitely a &quot;hoity-toity&quot; kind of anime. But for me, I really took the anime seriously, as I was always wondering how they can depict a story such as this. I wasn&#039;t all disappointed with the whole story since I actually find it amusing. As I mentioned before it has comedy where at some point will be enough to make you grin, however it can get too nonsensical that may leave a bad taste for some. As for the plot, I expected that Kazuhito would struggle to look for a way to return human. Although it did portray that for the beginning, as the story progresses, it consequently depicts the unfortunate life of Kazuhito as a dog under Kirihime&#039;s care, showing no development in the story from then on.<br />
<br />
 So if your looking for an anime with a decent story to begin with, then Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou will give you a good start in its premise but will leave you wanting if you linger.<br />
<br />
Visual and Audio quality: 7/10<br />
Visual quality here seems generic as it has many iterations in many anime shows of the same ecosystem; nothing outstanding but still palpable enough to keep it away from looking bad. Animations run great and I can&#039;t really point anything worth of complaining.<br />
<br />
As for audio, the seiyuus did great in their performance of livening up their selected characters in the show. Soundtrack is nice on both opening and ending themes as it reflects the almost everything what the show has to offer, but not really worth listening more than once. Sound effects also doesn&#039;t disappoint.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
The characters in the story are almost like synonyms and antonyms with one another; e.g. tsundere and yandere; sadist and masochist; shy girl and outgoing girl, etc. Every individual are worth knowing since they make an impact in the story. But then again, there&#039;s barely any development in the story. Character design is also done great as every character has distinctive characteristics that make them stand out in the bunch like Kirihime&#039;s red eyes, black coat and long shears and even Kazuhito - the only dog in the show.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />
Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is an anime of interest that founds itself out of the norm of having an animal as a protagonist among the cast of human beings. Despite the absurdness of the story, I still found it enjoyable. But through better or for worse, it is still a watchable show.<br />
