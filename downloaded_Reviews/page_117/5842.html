I finished Ga-Rei: Zero a few days ago (enjoyed the shit out of it) and heard that Kagura and Yomi are on this Anime i thought to myself &quot;wow really?, does this mean this is a side story or someones point of view to the GRZ story&quot; but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164505">
        no they&#039;re just there for 2 minutes and then never seen again.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, i&#039;ll keep the story brief.<br />
Tokyo ESP centers around a teenaged girl named Rinka Urushiba who must stop some douchebag from creating conflict between Humans and Espers.<br />
A few people are introduced and help her along the way including Peggy a flying penguin (the anime does not explain why it flies) whos main purpose is just to sadly get its ass beat by the enemy.<br />
<br />
One annoying thing is during the last 2 episodes of the anime the characters randomly pull out a &quot;Special Move&quot; and end it with something like &quot;This is the fruit of my training!&quot; well then, when the hell did you start your training? the only character we see training (and failing) is the Protagonist and her final result is the ability to normally kick someone in the face.<br />
<br />
I thought that Rinka&#039;s ability was a smart idea but for this Anime it was stupid. Besides checking if someone is buried under concrete there was no purpose of it because she can&#039;t save them herself and she can&#039;t go through people or their attacks plus her fighting skills are pretty weak (that is why she trains) so it normally ends with her and her face in the floor.<br />
<br />
The Osts i thought were out of place.<br />
The opening Ost was cheerful and happy and was like &#039;Hey lets run in a field of sunflowers&#039;.<br />
While the ending Ost is the opposite it&#039;s heavy metal and really dark, a bit too dark for this Anime. But this Ost for me was probably the best thing about this Anime. Just waiting for the episode to finish just to hear it again.    <br />
<br />
So yeah, thats all i can say about Tokyo ESP not really a great Anime to watch and has quite a bit of flaws. Ga-Rei fans will be disappointed.

    Tokyo ESP. A show about people with a variety of superpowers duking it out against each other. How can you go wrong with that?<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
Frankly, the story of ESP is a jumbled mess. The first episode sets the stage well. It introduces the world and the conflict between factions, and leaves the story open to development. Super powered beings called Espers have rebelled and taken Tokyo hostage. People are panicking. Everything is going wrong. And then the protagonist appears to save the day. The first episode left me keen for more. I was exited to see where the plot would go.<br />
<br />
And then, it pulled a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162387">
        Gungrave and threw the plot back into the past.<br />
<br />
Starting a story in the present and then jumping back to the past is a horrible decision. If you see a character in the present episode, you know they at least survive until that point. Therefore, any fights that are supposed to be highly impact full and tense really don&#039;t amount to anything. <br />
<br />
The entire past arc felt like I was watching a drawn out montage.<br />
<br />
After trudging through ESP&#039;s past sequence, eagerly awaiting the part of the story I was interested in, I was greeted with one of the most lackluster finales I&#039;ve ever watched. All the plot&#039;s events basically amount to nothing, the villains motivations make absolutely no sense, and the conclusion is left open ended for a second season. On its own, Tokyo ESP just doesn&#039;t stack up, and I doubt a second season will change that.<br />
<br />
ESP also tries its hand at making a love triangle between characters, but it feels forced and falls flat. There&#039;s also an attempt to touch on themes of racism and unfair judgement, but again, this doesn&#039;t strike a nerve at all.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
<br />
Art wise, ESP doesn&#039;t stand out, nor does it suffer from poor animation quality. Its just average.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
<br />
Again, nothing that memorable here either. Whilst background sounds and the VO are passable, Tokyo ESP&#039;s OST is lacking, so it falls below average.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
<br />
Nothing special about Tokyo ESP&#039;s characters at all. They&#039;re mostly shallow and one dimensional, and a lot of their actions don&#039;t make any sense. There are some moments where they can be likeable, but these are few and far between. ESP also contains the contender for worst villain (I&#039;ve never witnessed a character this poorly constructed). <br />
<br />
Like the other categories, the characters just fell flat.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Tokyo ESP just felt like a waste. The premise is wasted, the story is jumbled, the characters are dull. All that stands out are its flaws, and there are many.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict: 3/10

    In a world full of crime, there is an anime that has potential to became awesome using superpowers, however, it turned out to be a mess. That anime is Tokyo ESP. Tokyo ESP is produced by Xebec.<br />
<br />
STORY (4):<br />
<br />
The story follows Rinka Urushiba, a normal high school student who is a bit poor and her father is the only one who raise her. Rinka has to work as a waitress after school to raise money for rent and food. One day, she sees a penguin and some glowing fish swimming through the sky. Rinka came into contact with the fish and she develops ESP powers. ESP

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179614">
        Powers are basically supernatural powers.<br />
<br />
This anime was inspired by X-Men powers and so they produced an anime that deals with supernatural powers. It wasn&#039;t known in the US because people might think that this anime copied X-Men powers.<br />
<br />
The problem with this anime is that they never address where does the glowing fish came from. Not only that the plot is a complete mess. Events just happen randomly without any meaning at all. The second episode is basically the first episode where Rinka was lying naked in the room. <br />
<br />
The ending gives no closure to all the characters. <br />
<br />
ART (4):<br />
<br />
The animation at some parts are bland and wooded, while other parts are decent. The first episode fight was good while the rest not so much.<br />
<br />
SOUND (4):<br />
<br />
The opening and ending are ok.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (3):<br />
<br />
Black Fist is my favourite character of the show. She is intimidating and badass.<br />
<br />
Rinka is also a badass however, her personality wasn&#039;t interesting to me.<br />
<br />
Azuma is a generic character who is always there for Rinka.<br />
<br />
I guess there is not much to say for the rest of the characters. They are too generic even the main villain as well. <br />
<br />
CONCLUSION (3):<br />
<br />
Overall, Tokyo ESP could have been entertaining but with it&#039;s lacklustre story, uninteresting characters and anti-climactic ending, it just comes off as forgettable. <br />
<br />
So I give this anime a 3 out of 10.<br />

    Tokyo ESP is just about exactly what it sounds like. Tokyo is the location of the setting while ESP stands for extra-sensory perception. Add two more letters to that and you get ‘esper’, the term used to designate individuals who possesses powers beyond human capability. The premise is essentially about a girl named Rinka Urushiba who develops special abilities of her own after one faithful day that changes her life forever. It’s nothing new to see really as generic would be the first word that comes to mind if I was to describe this setup. To enjoy Tokyo ESP, you’ll have to see the show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164157">
        from another perspective for some painless fun.<br />
<br />
From the same author that bought to you Ga-Rei, don’t be surprised if you see some similarities. Hajime Segawa’s writing combines an essence of supernatural in a modern setting with some depth of dark edginess. Director Shigehito Takayanagi’s involvement is also somewhat noticeable with his return. Nonetheless, the first episode essentially drops down a lot of concept. The main focus is that espers are perceived as monsters due to their potentials. Treated perhaps as malevolent entities of the world, the introduction shows espers showing off their powers while the world appalled by their actions. It quickly goes with a path of action in full throttle mode with even a bike crash gimmick to add to the mix. However, that’s only the beginning.<br />
<br />
The show actually breaks down the barriers of the story in little molecules. That’s because the following episodes begins to follow the life of a regular high school girl. Meet Rinka, a girl who has developed the ability to phase through objects. When using the power, her hair turns white. Hence, the medium dubs her the “White Girl”. Get it? Sounds cheesy but it makes sense to portray what she is. What we also learn about Rinka is that she has a strong sense of justice developed by the influence of her father. Justice comes at a price though as we learn how dangerous some of Rinka’s opponents can be. The show introduces other espers some who uses their power for good such as Kyotaro Azuma while others uses them for evil. The generic ‘good vs evil’ cliché takes onto high gear as each episode begins to unravel itself. What we also learn is the hidden motive of an organization seeking to bind the world under their power. In honesty, this whole superpower enterprise is so straightforward, one can’t help but thinking the concept is overdue. Perhaps X-Men would ring a bell with this show’s gimmicks. I don’t label Tokyo ESP as an X-Men clone though but rather as an example with their similarities. Taken for granted, Tokyo ESP also likes to play around a bit with its premise with a balance of lighthearted comedy.<br />
<br />
Despite the parallelism with X-Men, Tokyo ESP is somewhat clever with its concepts. The series both tell and shows how esper develop their powers through contact with a mysterious fish. Did you hear that right? As bizarre as it sounds, the premise adapts these tones and gets stranger when you see a penguin flying in the air. By the time Tokyo ESP ends though, you shouldn’t be too surprised with the methods this show use to introduce characters and concepts. You’ll feast eyes on flying psychic fishes, talking panda, flying penguins, and over-sized tankers in mid-air during broad daylight. This show might as well rename itself Tokyo War when it comes to the way espers are treated. From propaganda and accusation, espers are labeled as evil. The amount of prejudice is almost surprising as the show sets it up so that almost anyone can gain esper powers thus changing momentum. However, cleverness also has its limits. The classic ‘evil organization tries to rule the world’ takes no time to make itself well known. The organization led by a man named “The Professor” plays the role antagonists with his sub-coordinates. Of course, it’s easy to guess what Rinka has to say about that. But with all this, it leads to inadequate balance of the story especially with pacing. In essence, it’s bad storytelling.<br />
<br />
Besides Rinka, the show likes to surround itself with others that gets involved with the story. Characters such as Kobushi and Peggy steps into the shoes of supporting roles with little development. There is some relationship dynamics though. The most prominent would be Rinka and her father as we see their closeness. Azuma and Minami also shares an oddball bond although it sharply contrasts with the family values of Rinka’s connection. Unfortunately, characterization is almost non-existent for many of the characters as the show goes full turbo with its story. Actually, that could be wrong as the pacing of the show’s story also feels slow at times. Training exercises and peculiar humor substitutes with story development while high school girl crushes recreates an attempt at romance development between the main characters. It loses focus when it comes to the heartfelt moments. Although there are some back stories (mostly vague and leaves viewers in the dark), it doesn’t ultimate achieve its intended purpose. The heartfelt moments doesn’t really touch the heart at all as it’s easy to lose interest in the characters. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the story couldn’t be any more generic as The Professor declares the world (in his own view) as ‘beyond saving’. In truth, the show uses these generic attributes to flesh out the potentials of the heroes. Rinka in particular challenges against The Professor’s ideology with both her words and actions. Besides that, the show also likes to challenge itself with how much prejudice can go. In one particular case, a woman almost gets herself and her son killed as the world realizes how dangerous espers can truly be when provoked. It teaches a lesson to humans as to what justifies as morally right or wrong. The problem is how Tokyo ESP presents this lesson as it’s too straightforward…especially with the resulting consequences. However, the series is able to rebound a bit itself when it comes to creativity with espers. There are a variety of powers that let the viewers see the testament of esper powers. Whether it’s telekinesis, teleportation, or phasing, the show stays honest with its technical aspects. These powers also result in some spectacular fighting sequences with decent adaptation.<br />
<br />
Studio Xebecs had their hands full on this adaptation. They played around with it a bit and the result is a moderate portrait of its framework. Character designs are tolerant with faithfulness to the manga. However, there’s nothing particularly special about it either. Fan service is minimal although there are some suggestive camera shots that raises eyebrows. Background artwork is also fairly simple and underdeveloped. The most prominent aspect of the visuals might be the special effects. Some optimism will pay off as the fighting between espers can be attractive to watch. Overall though, the artwork isn’t anything special but not terribly wrong either.<br />
<br />
Music reminds me of the time when I used to watch X-Men. The OST has this vibrant beat that suggests every action should be shounen-like while adapting superpower themes. It shouldn’t be a mistake to underestimate this show’s diehard edginess with the soundtrack either. Most climatic scenes are capped off with dynamic entrances and exits. Now, I do give credit to some of the character voices in particular when they are in situations that evoke emotions. The OP and ED songs also have a sense of creativity with the artistic montage and symbolism.<br />
<br />
12 episodes. This might raise the question such as “is that all?” The show could probably work better for a full 2 cour series especially considering the manga actually has two parts. Nonetheless, Tokyo ESP seems like one of those shows that grows progressively incoherent. It’s good for some combative action and sets up its premise right with developing interest. However, the way characters are crafted falls into a hole of non-sensational worth. The minimal character development, lack of relationship building, and dive between goofy/serious moments struggles to earn the show any praise. In the end, Tokyo ESP is a show with somewhat acceptable fashioned action and fun. However, it’s far from attaining superior satisfaction on screen. <br />

    When I watch this thing, there are a couple of things that remind me of:<br />
<br />
1. Batman<br />
2. X Men<br />
3. From Paris with love (the 2010 action movie)<br />
4. 300<br />
5. Big Boss<br />
6. Taking of Pelham 123 (2009 action movie)<br />
7. Dan Inosanto ( the Kali guy whom Bruce Lee fought in &quot;Game of Death&quot;)<br />
8. Jumper (A 2009 Sci-fi movie)<br />
9 DC Comics heroes<br />
10. Samurai Flamenco <br />
<br />
So, I just gonna go direct to the point by stating my ratings for this anime.<br />
<br />
Story, art and characters: Poor 3.<br />
<br />
It maybe a spin off of &quot;Gai Ren Zero,&quot; it may have a plot and it may have a story, but it ain&#039;t original, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162857">
        concept was a complete  plagiarize of plot from the things that I&#039;ve mention from above in a bits and pieces way, from the Espers running amack in the streets of Tokyo to the occupation of the diet, I mean-c&#039;mon, what&#039;s more to explain, when it was pretty obvious  from the very start up to the finish, also, one can&#039;t deny as to how inconsistent as the first episode conflicts the last episode and that&#039;s something you have to watch since putting a spoiler would result them mods getting in my nerve (dang).<br />
<br />
About the characters and art, it was pretty obvious that the way they were illustrated by writer Hajime Segawa and anime director  Shigehito Takayanagi where somewhat  plagiarize as well except that they modify it a bit to in a parody way so that it won&#039;t look like it was plagiarize, but still their characteristics where also plagiarize as well, now let go to them characters one by one:<br />
<br />
Rinka Urushiba: Frankly, she is a parody of Storm from the X-man, except that she has the powers of Shadow cat, frankly she is Storm who has the attitude of Wonderwoman, her Kali skill was a copy from Dan Inosanto&#039;s scene from the Game of Death.<br />
<br />
Kyōtarō Azuma: He is like Masayoshi Hazama from &quot;Samumenco&quot; in fact he is a complete plagiarize of the character from the said anime, except that he has feelings for Rinka, his powers was the same as &quot;Night Crawler&quot; from the X men and he also has the same traits of Hazama from &#039;Samumenco&quot;. <br />
<br />
Rindō Urushiba: the main heroine&#039;s dad who for obvious reason looks like Wolverine, who has the powers of Magneto, and has the attitude of Batman.<br />
<br />
Kobushi Kuroi: One look at her you would know that she is Jean Grey, who has the powers of Sue Storm from the &quot;Fantastic 4,&quot; however she has the attitude of Wolverine from the &#039;X Men.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Murasaki Edoyama: One look at her , she is a female Bruce Lee who has the powers of &quot;Psych-lock&quot; or is that another telepath from the &quot;X-men?&quot; Well, I not sure since I&#039;m not familiar with all the characters from &quot;X-men.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Ayumu Oozora: he is like Dan Inosanto whose powers of Precognition whom I don&#039;t know where to refer it to, didn&#039;t fare up as far as I&#039;m concern.<br />
<br />
Pandaemon Youdani, Peggi and Parrot the Pelican:..........I just have no way of describing them.<br />
<br />
The Professor/Hokusai Azuma: Ok, for obvious reasons, he is more like a parody of &quot;Two face&quot; who is one of Batman&#039;s nemesis and happens to have the powers of Professor X.<br />
<br />
Minami Azuma: as I describe her, she is like Mystique who has the powers of Nigh Crawler as well.<br />
<br />
Of course let&#039;s not forget the other support characters like:<br />
<br />
Murasaki&#039;s dad who is a parody of King Leonidas from the 300.<br />
<br />
The Police Chief who looks like Jules Winnfield from &#039;Pulp Fiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
and the baldie guy of the anti esper task force, who looks like Charlie Wax from &quot;Paris with love.&quot;<br />
<br />
So why would I give the story, art and Characters a poor score? Co&#039;z there really is nothing original about them and I think I&#039;ve mentioned that already.<br />
<br />
Sound and Enjoyment: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s see, I like the opening theme and I like the seiyuus who did the character&#039;s voices, PERIOD! The enjoyable part was seeing the antagonist getting beaten by the good guys and that&#039;s as good as it gets.<br />
<br />
Overall: Decent 4.<br />
<br />
Despite of all the plagiarisms that has been modified into a parody and despite of hoe good the sound and how enjoyable it is...unfortunately, I can only give it a 4, since I can&#039;t deny about this anime&#039;s lack of originality, but it was still good enough to be enjoyed and that&#039;s how the cookie crumbles in this anime.    <br />
<br />
 <br />

    I&#039;ll keep this short and sweet.<br />
<br />
Characters absolutely sucked ass. The story was predictable and cliche. The soundtrack was okay. The art suffered immensely during action scenes (not to mention the weird lip shadows).<br />
<br />
Cliche, cliche, cliche. Nothing much to it. May be a good anime for beginners that haven&#039;t seen enough cliches yet, but to someone who actually watches a shatton of stuff, this anime was complete booty.

    Do you love heroes? Do you believe in miracles? Well I hope you do because you&#039;re going to be hearing a lot of that if you&#039;re planning to watch this series. <br />
<br />
[STORY: 7/10]<br />
The storyline is actually a very simple and traditional template of &quot;Good v.s. Evil&quot; and that&#039;s pretty much it. I&#039;m giving extra credit for the fact that they have a pretty decent back-story to back up all the latter&#039;s actions. A good back-story never fails to hit a soft spot in me. So apart from that, there are moments of fighting (somewhat... at least they tried) which may or may not intrigue you.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169851">
        For me, the fighting scenes didn&#039;t really work out that well, it looked more like they did it for the sake of doing it, and it wasn&#039;t well produced at all. <br />
<br />
[SOUND: 9/10]<br />
Oh, now this is BRILLIANT. Barring the OP and ED which can actually sound quite catchy after listening 12 times (or more), the background music was fantastic to say the least. Suitable music were played at suitable moments, and the tracks themselves were very good. This was especially the case in the last episode where every track I&#039;ve heard throughout the past 11 episodes were actually played in somewhat quick succession. <br />
<br />
[CHARACTER: 8/10]<br />
Don&#039;t know &#039;bout the others, but this series actually features decent character development, especially for the lead female (obviously). A typical story about how a character overcomes her weaknesses and gains strengths from various sources to beat down the enemy. Oh, but the romance side of this series was irritating to me, if I need to criticize on an area. <br />
<br />
[OVERALL: 7/10]<br />
So taking into consideration other factors as well, I feel that this series deserves a 7 in my books. It&#039;s not too bad, but it ain&#039;t that great as well. But I&#039;d think that it was worth a shot and worth the time. So check it out, guys!

    ...And all of a sudden errryone had superpowers. Tokyo ESP is an anime in which many people get superpowers because they are on drugs. I say this because a select few persons can see fishes swimming around in air (obviously they are under influence of drugs). The first thing I would think if I saw a flying penguin or fluorescent fishes in the air is ask myself if I am sane. Not these characters, they just believe and inmediately accept what they see. Anyway, jokes aside, these fishes seem to give people superpowers by going in a person. All you have to do is wish

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204287">
        for it (that&#039;s the impression I got, at least) and you get it.<br />
<br />
There is no real explanation as to how the superpowers work; in the first episode I even thought the superpowers were due to the accesories the villains were wearing. However, this disappears later on, so it might be the authors thought the same thing and wanted to make clear that the superpowers were the real deal. There also seems to be a very limited amount of superpowers. I think it does not make any sense for people to have the same skill, but this is, again, not explained. <br />
<br />
Another issue is the powerups. It looks like less than a week of training makes you a pro fighter; if you are a genius, you can certainly make faster progress, but not this fast. Besides, all the people are not so bright, most people have mental disorders and some people just know everything; no explanation as to why they know. Are they psychics or something? This obviously makes no sense. <br />
<br />
All right, I will just say it: this story does not make any sense. As the story progresses, events seem to have less connection to each other, which results in a bland story. One example is that the connection with the first episode is not well made, since statements that were done in the 1st episode are overwritten and forgotten. Finally, the last episode is an incredible ass-pull: everything &quot;ends&quot; in one single chapter, making everything that happened in this episode plain dumb.<br />
<br />
Tokyo ESP has a cast of characters made in such a way that they made me laugh when I first saw them. We have Wolverine as &quot;Muscle Dad&quot;, Aristotle as &quot;That yakuza guy&quot;, the male main character (whom I liked most) as &quot;The youngster that has seen too much JoJo&quot; and the female MC as &quot;She who became super strong all of a sudden but is useless anyway&quot;. Of course there are other characters; one of them is a villain who all of a sudden decided to become friends with the MC just to help fight against &quot;true&quot; evil. There is that girl with glasses that appears in EVERY anime who is quite useless and a boy with glasses who looks like an idiot. I will also write a line about mascots. There were three exotic mascots in this anime. One. every. 4. episodes. Personally, I don&#039;t think mascots make something more popular (I found them annoying), but it looks like the authors thought it was the key to success.<br />
<br />
The characters have vague pasts at best (even for the male MC), and the reason why they do what they do is not clear either. I guess the authors did not want to think too much about it, since all explanations have holes in them. I think that in the end the villains were the righteous ones. Personally, I won&#039;t trust a government that hires Jason (you know, that madman with the mask &amp; bat) as policeman. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is quite good, but I have the impression that battle music is used in the wrong moments. And there is a serious issue with the first episode; the music is so ridiculously loud you can&#039;t hear the characters talking, which I found quite annoying. Or maybe I just downloaded the episode from the wrong place.<br />
<br />
The art is allright, not really special. Almost all the side characters are incredibly ugly, which is quite funny. I guess all attention has to go to the main and secondary characters. But the mouths... my god. The shading on them is just weird, it feels like the characters are continually using &quot;smug face&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, Tokyo ESP is not something really good, but if you have some time to fill you might want to give it a shot. Just don&#039;t expect much of it. My rating is a 5.<br />
<br />
Oh right, this is my first review, so please tell me what you thought about it.<br />
<br />

    So, small disclaimer before I start my review. For this anime, you most likely will have to shut of any kind of logic you might reconsider, you wont find any of it here. If you decided to give it a shot, then listen closely to its story as it will likely kick you of to the reaction of ,,Wait,What?&#039;&#039; when you miss a small detail. Now to to the real review..<br />
<br />
Tokyo ESP had also been one of the newest Animes of the last season. It is the Story of a Highschool Girl called Rinka Urushiba. Now the first thing you&#039;ll see is that the atmosphere

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167389">
        reminds of old and brings you nostalgia from animes like ,,Detective Conan&#039;&#039; or ,,Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne&#039;&#039;.<br />
Now Rinka does seem to be the everyday Highschool-Girl until she meets a dear Friend to her. And from here on the story takes the crazy route.<br />
<br />
Both of them meet and are able to see flying golden fishes, a living phenomenon that if it flies through you , you are going to get ESP-Powers. Rinka in this way did get the ability to go through objects and let objects pass through her. <br />
The Story then takes quick and fast turns, which is incredibly confusing if you are not very focusing. So if you just casually watch anime , without trying to invest yourself into a particular anime, this will not be a good choice for you.<br />
<br />
It takes a few episodes to realise that what I already said, it takes good examples from old animes and unfortunately fails to recreate their glory and has some incredibly corny lines now and then. What never had gotten into me is the first approach of the villains-it is not menacing it is just a girl and a huge-hulk-like guy that dress up as samurai and are able to ,,guide&#039;&#039; those fishes. <br />
<br />
The Sound is a bit lost and query, you dont feel emotion with it as you normally should. Like an epic battle theme or to show the struggle. It is rather mediocre, so if you are an audible person like me, you wont like this anime.<br />
<br />
Characters, as I already said - are a bit corny and more stereotypical, there could have been much more done with the old man in the panda costume for example. It leaves much questions open like , why did the professor change to a hatred with such big extent. Why does his daughter keep following him, despite her wanting to change, is ESP lost with death ?<br />
<br />
Overall I didnt enjoy it that much, the only point where the emotion really hits you is when the doctors wife , after they were badly wounded, uses her esp and her last bit of power before she dies in his arms.<br />
<br />
An overall point of 5-6. It didnt really go where I thought it would have been<br />
<br />
If you decide to immerse yourself in this anime, do one thing, which is keeping an open view and do not try to find the red line to connect everything, it will be much more enjoyable then.

    This anime was such a let down. From the first 4 episode one would think that its going places just to later find out its going straight down a cliff. The story at first seemed cool on how they stole a building and what not to create a new city from the rubles. But when they go to the past to explain everything then it just turns to crap.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
First of all you hardly feel attached to any of them. The characters are just motivated by a crap love story that goes no where. How did asuma and white girl chick get love ties anyway? It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162523">
        felt so forced and out of place. The panda thats suppose to be a sensei is useless. I thought he was going to kickass but he never gets too. All the characters just arnt interesting.<br />
<br />
Story: What started off as a cool premise fell way short. The whole taking over tokyo thing could of gone way better. The ending made no sense what so ever. <br />
<br />
Art: Good but what the fucks wrong with some characters eyes. All black or white, shits ugly.<br />
<br />
Sound: eww nothing memorable.<br />
<br />
What started off as a good series ended in a train crash. If you have others animes to watch then ignore this one for the time being. <br />

    Tokyo Esp from the first episode was set up to be nothing more than a mediocre take on X-Men.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
The plot is extremely cliché and straight-forward: there are a group of humans with special abilities who take advantage of their power to take over the world, and there is the protagonists, who also happen to have special abilities who are going to use their abilities who take down the bad guys.<br />
The first episode shows the peak of the show to try and grasp the viewers to see what&#039;s to come, but with this it meant that the show became very predictable to the viewer, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162563">
        made it a lucklustre experience.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: 5<br />
The art was average at best. The character designs were very straight forward but i didn&#039;t feel like anything particularly stood out.  The animation was fluid and i didn&#039;t notice any hiccups in it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
The only thing which i think stood out on the OST, was the ending theme &#039;Kyuusei Argyros&#039; as it was fact paced, and so it fit in well with the show. The opening theme however i thought was very out of place as it was too happy go lucky, which really wasn&#039;t the vibe of the show.<br />
<br />
Characters : 1<br />
This has to be the biggest thing wrong with this show and the reason why i began to resent it.<br />
Rinka and Azuma are meant to be the protagonists , and to see them suffer so much and remain so helpless in unbearable. I mean they are unable to fend for themselves for the majority of the show and constantly get the crap beaten out of them.<br />
All of the other characters seem very flat and one dimensional.  The Professor was the only antagonist who explained their motives, and seemed justified.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2<br />
I feel like i wasted several hours i&#039;ll never get back after watching this show. Everything was a mess and all over the place and i never grew to care for any of the characters at all.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
<br />
I feel like i&#039;m being too nice giving this a 3 as it was a train-wreck from start to finish. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re thinking of watching this show, please don&#039;t bother. Just go and watch the original X-Men series instead, which is one hundred times better than this.

    Tokyo ESP came with a lot of hype and potential among this seasons line up, unfortunately it failed to deliver<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
<br />
The potential was there, the manga provided a strong story, but in this case, the anime was a complete mess. It fell short in all aspects of suspense, action, romance, etc. There were many plot holes and inconsistencies through T ESP that made in nearly unbearable. Much was left unexplained and you justfelt unsatisfied with the play off many scenes<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
<br />
For the most part the art was ok, references, clean, good lighting, but as the anime progressed this seemed to become stale. The fight scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162531">
        were always something that didn&#039;t work, and this became more apparent as the anime prolonged. The art for the characters also felt a bit like a copy and paste job, as many of the main characters had very similar faces.<br />
<br />
Sound:7<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was probably what saved this anime, it worked well and the team behind this deserve all the credit. It had that sense of action and the hype building that this anime deserved. Voice and sound-effects were also fine, par i would say. The sound did seem slightly too subtle and quiet in some scenes however, rather than an epic moment in a scene they set the scene rather than become a part of it.<br />
<br />
Character:6<br />
<br />
As before mentioned this anime contains references so a host of lovable characters were portrayed. The main character was relate-able and worked fine, but it was some of the supporting characters that fell flat. While Master Roushi and Peggy were fan favourites, others such as Kyotaro and the Professor were poor. Some characters were either completely useless, while offers goals and aims were absurd and illogical, making it hard to warm up to take them seriously. Others were introduced but with no stroy or introduction, they were just there, appeared.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:4<br />
<br />
Initially i enjoyed it but by episode 5 the plot was drab and the many flaws became apparent, it started to become so flawed that much of the anime left you confused or questioning the aims of the story and the characters<br />
<br />
Overall:5<br />
<br />
Overall i give it a 5, if you committed to more than 6 episodes it was watch-able, but if not its no must see. The plots many flaws are quickly identifiable and your left dissatisfied with the overall result. Tokyo ESP has its charms, but overall, its forgettable

    &quot;Tokyo ESP&quot; is an anime that downgrades espers, turning them into whiny teenagers who feel the need to gripe about their unfortunate past.<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime first captured my heart at the word &#039;ESP.&#039; Unfortunately, I was to have many not-so-heart-capturing moments throughout watching the series.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tokyo ESP&quot; is a sci-fi staring Rinka, an extremely poor high school girl who lives with just her father in modern Tokyo. One day, on the way home from school, she chases a &quot;flying penguin&quot; to the top of New Tokyo Tower—only to have &quot;fish swimming in the air&quot; suddenly appear before her. One of the fish goes through Rinka and gives

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163781">
        her an extraordinary power beyond those of normal humans; the ability to slip through solid objects. She then meets Azuma, a boy wanting her to become a hero?<br />
<br />
Rinka, a girl who&#039;s personality is constantly developing and yet getting no real development at all, is voiced by Ibuki Kido (Yume [Pupa]). Kido captures her stubborn, and annoying personality, do a wonderful job with an insecure girl who&#039;d like to play the part of &#039;hero.&#039; Azuma, the rowdy and determined boy, is voiced by Keisuke Koumoto (Raul Chaser [Yuushibu]). He has a deep voice, and make it sound like he really does want to become a hero to save the planet from evil foes. <br />
I will flat out say I did not like this series. As soon as the first episode finished, I was left with many questions. Who are espers? Where did these bad guys come from? White Girl? What&#039;s that? And as soon as the second episode came out, my questions were dismissed, and thrown in the trash. It turns out the series started, jumping ahead to the climax, and later on went to introduce the characters. I have to say, I hate when series do this. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Other than that, the music was average, as well as the voice acting. The characters were bland as well as the storyline, and it basically turned into a kid&#039;s flick about &#039;justice.&#039;<br />
<br />
If you like simple story formats, despite being confusing through all twelve episodes, then this is the anime for you! However, if you are of a discerning mind and wouldn&#039;t want to bother yourself with a anime that is just going to make you regret your life decisions, turn back now! I repeat. Turn back now! That is all.<br />
-<br />
<br />
Story - 5<br />
The story and overall message of the anime was fine, but it would have been nice to get a little more detail in there, a better plot line, better antagonists -- can the storyline just change all together?<br />
<br />
Art - 7<br />
The art was good. The animators certainly put more details out towards the end, but it was a fresh art style.<br />
<br />
Music - 7<br />
The music was alright, but there was nothing that really stood out to me.<br />
<br />
Character - 5<br />
The characters had average personalities with average development. I could hardly differentiate the teenagers from the adults. They all acted like immature teenagers to me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
My hype for this anime was high, but after the first episode, everything just went downhill from there. On some days, I even tried to avoid watching it, even putting it off till the last minute.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5.8<br />
The anime would have been good if it had developed more, and gotten its priorities straight. I just felt that the pacing was off the entire time, and couldn&#039;t really get attached to the characters.

    Oh god this anime seems so bad. I&#039;ve read all the 53 manga chapters available as of now , and let me tell from what I saw on the first episode there seemed to several new characters that never showed up on manga. Also based on what I read on others&#039;s reviews I&#039;m even more disapointed, Azuma and the main villan were called generic as well other characters. wow that&#039;s so no true, in the manga they&#039;re all very interestin,g each has their backstory and dept they grow as the story procedes. You should definetely read the manga and skip the anime you won&#039;t regret

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185747">
        it, it&#039;s really worth your time, plus the art is much more interesting than this generic new anime style.

    Well to begin with I don&#039;t dislike this anime like most of the reviews, on the contrary I find that it can be quite fun to watch. It is not perfect for a lot of reasons as : rushed story, characters that don&#039;t have a really good depth into them, between other things. Below I will list the grades I gave to each topic...<br />
<br />
-Story (8):<br />
<br />
The story could have been really interesting, but it was rushed and had some plot holes that weren&#039;t explained, nothing that a second season couldn&#039;t have dealt with. The plot is about a girl named Rinka that all the sudden finds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195957">
        out that she acquired some kind of powers, witch are called ESP in the anime. At the same time a treat appears, a guy that calls himself professor is threatening all Tokyo and the human kind. She then decides to start fighting for the humans alongside her friends. As it is only a 12 episode anime there are a lot of explanation missing, but it is still a fun plot that could turn out to be really good.<br />
<br />
-Art (7):<br />
<br />
The art is not horrible but it is not great. It is like any other average action/supernatural anime.<br />
-Sound (7):<br />
<br />
The opening has a good music, nothing special but i enjoyed it. The anime it self has a good soundtrack that again, is nothing that would give it a 10 but it still works.<br />
<br />
-Character (6)<br />
<br />
I guess that an 26 episode anime would have fit this anime well. Characters are not developed enough, even though there are some flashbacks that makes you understand some of their purposes and histories. I felt like there are still some things missing. They are just average, nothing great.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment (8):<br />
<br />
I Enjoyed it. Even though it has its drawbacks it is still an enjoyable anime if you can look past its mistakes and just enjoy the show itself. It probably won&#039;t be between your favorites but still deserves a shot, my final score is a good (7)

    I will keep this brief and to the point. Unfortunately I only managed to make it to episode four so bear that in mind while reading my review. The most glaring issue I had with this anime is the pacing. From the get-go, the series attempts to depict the story as with other stories; having an event that occurs in the future end it getting shown in the first episode.<br />
<br />
Now, this is a tool often used in stories which I am fine with if it is done properly. This anime did it in an appalling manner to where I was nearly turned-off from the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160407">
        episode. The purpose of telling a story in such a way is to bring up question and intrigue the audience. This anime made the mistake of throwing in too many names and pieces of information that normally we would know later in the series. It felt like series that you jumped into the 100th episode and are completely baffled (not in a good way). <br />
<br />
The animation was what kept me going with the slight hint of some sort of hope. Unfortunately, the pacing continued to where it felt like scenes were missing and dialogue felt off. A major contention I had with the series was the lack of proper transitions within the scenes which leads to losing all interest. I had hoped it might turn into something alright but I just could not bear waiting any longer.

    What if you are an esper? Well, some people would like doing some cool stuff or try to become a hero or “joining the dark side”. Tokyo ESP is about a teenage girl who become an esper and later on become stronger in order to protect people and becoming a hero. When I heard the manga will be animated, I am so freaking happy since I’m a fan of its manga. But, the anime adaption seems fast pace adaptation, and doesn’t follow up its original story although the chronology of time is same, so you would want to read the manga (absolutely, do it!!) from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213654">
        the start because the story has a potential to become much more awesome.<br />
<br />
The synopsis follows up Rinka, a teenage girl who lives a normal life until she has a power to become an esper. After that, she meets a boy named Azuma and together fights the evil that come disturbing Tokyo. The story seem plain with good versus evil, but as story progress which is focus about Rinka having train to become stronger in each fight she has lost and Azuma with its background story. <br />
<br />
The animation seems ok in my opinion, although there is some fight scene which looks like awkward. But, other than that, it was good with the background building, power display animation, and the teleportation scene was awesome to me.<br />
<br />
Original soundtrack in this anime was okay, like when they change the music to make the fight scene more impact or when the sad scenes more immerse. Other than that, it was average.<br />
<br />
The conclusion, it was good but I do not recommend for those who have read the manga first, because the anime will crush the hype from the manga. For those who don’t read the manga, I do recommend to watch since it will give you a little bit insight about the story, and I still want to recommend reading the manga after watching the anime. For that, I give 8/10, although it was not good enough to satisfy me, it was still good anime adaption. <br />

    To be honest, I don&#039;t know how I should explain this series. Tokyo ESP is one of action series which I took because of the action genre only. As the series first made, my expectation is it would become a little good because of the promising almost-ending scene in the first episode. But, as the series went, my expectation came down and almost drowned into the deep of the sea with the ending.<br />
<br />
Tokyo ESP is a series which told us a normal high school girl and got a special ability. The girls then become a hero who tried to save the town from another special

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164247">
        people. It&#039;s cliche premise, but I was hoping the plot would be different. It turned out I&#039;m wrong.<br />
<br />
I hate the story most than another part. Many mystery at first, but a half-baked finishing for the mysteries. Not only the premise is cliche, the plot is really cliche too. The plot is a mess up, you might find it&#039;s so boring because of the repetition of same reaction of the characters. The ending is really bothering, because in my opinion, you won&#039;t need all of the 11 episodes just to reach the final plan of the antagonists. <br />
<br />
Another boring part of the story is how the action came. The action is really messing up with you because of the unresolute main antagonists. The main antagonists would make you dejected. I don&#039;t know how many time I were punching my desk just to watch the another unresolute desicion of the main antagonists. I hate how the antagonists made. The reaction of another side character such as one of the main character&#039;s mom is really made the series worse. It&#039;s okay if the mom&#039;s reaction like that, but I didn&#039;t get how the development of this character can made her changed. It really turn off the series, she should have never made into one.<br />
<br />
Despite how bad the story and how the character not made well, I quite like the art. The art is one of the reason why I was choosing this series. The art is solid and use a good coloring. The background is made well. The art is good overall, but not the best.<br />
<br />
The OP and ED is quite good. The ED give you a little sense of gore of the series, a quite true if there were no sensor there. I don&#039;t think bad about the BGM, I think it&#039;s fine as it is.<br />
<br />
Because of the story and the characters, I don&#039;t really enjoy this series. Several times I wanted the story ended quickly, I was tired to see the character.<br />
<br />
Tokyo ESP is a good example for a series with bad plot and the bad character. It can&#039;t be helped even with the art or another good part in this series. For you who want to watch a mediocre action series, this series is for you.

    this story has a nice flow, progresses rapidly and is effectively a series of events that lead you to draw your own conclusions regarding the deeper motivations of the characters. this is a simple, enjoyable show.<br />
the show starts at the &quot;beginning of the ending&quot; with episodes 1 and 11 occurring in the same time-frame which creates a sense of anticipation leading to the inevitable, reminiscent of the western superhero genre.<br />
just as when watching a movie like &quot;ironman&quot; or (conversely a non- superhero movie) &quot;rocky&quot;, it is not a story of whether the protagonist will win or lose but the efforts that lead them to that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166027">
        conclusion.<br />
it is my opinion that this can be enjoyed by any traditional superhero fan

    Too bad, Tokyo ESP Anime version, has started from Rinka encounter Professor on Battle at Diet (Japan Parliament Building), I think Tokyo ESP has good story quality, Doing anime that started or follow story on its Manga. It can be beneficial to the viewer.<br />
If you ask Why, the more I think about it...<br />
First Assumptions is the Director seems to want this Anime have a main story or protagonist on Ren Jōmyaku (ESP 2) but why there are new character like someone who use rider and gun (They aren&#039;t ESP right?) If so it&#039;s just like Plot drift.<br />
Second Assumptions is the story having Reverse chronology and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179854">
        of course timeskip, coz the story is already near the second arc, where story is about Tokyo as well as the fate of the other ESP users after ESP law passed, and then Rinka Urushiba and Kyōtarō Azuma take part on Human Trafficking and International Crimes and of course it isn&#039;t ordinary human but ESP users.<br />
I can conclude that this is just doesn&#039;t good because the story will not much episode, whereas the quality of story is great because there are element such as International and Political Issue, Nevertheless there are people who argue it is just like X-Men, of yeah cause the story is just fighting and ESP users (having weird power) and I worried if it make a great distinction than its story in manga which already great, but i hope Minami can be together with Kyōtarō to defeated other enemy as well as to save Minami father.
