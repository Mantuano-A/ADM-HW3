    People these days have extremely weird fetishes, especially men. Being aroused by the smell of sweat of people they fancy to the touch of a body part, these people can become sexually excited from the strangest of activities. Hell, some fetishes don’t even involve another human being at all.<br />
<br />
How would you react when you realize that all the people around you have these sorts of perverse desires? And the object of most of these fantasies are you? Hard to imagine, isn’t it? I mean, you really won’t come across too many situations in real life where you’re faced with such a conundrum. If you do,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318148">
        you’re one lucky (or unlucky) person.<br />
<br />
Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka? (Would you love a pervert as long as she&#039;s cute?) or HenSuki for short, places the protagonist in this exact, unimaginable real-life situation. Keiki Kiryuu, a high school teen who longs for a girlfriend, unexpectedly receives a love letter. Not only that, there’s a bonus: the letter contains a girl’s panty, and thus begins his quest to find the source of the letter. <br />
<br />
In his pursuit of the sender of the love letter, Keiki investigates every girl who’s close to him. And to his astonishment, he finds that they’re all perverts; one being a girl who wants to act like a dog and for him to be her master, another wanting to make Keiki her slave and many more. Keiki is an ordinary guy. He really is. From his looks to his teen antics, nothing about him is special or even different to the average Joe.<br />
<br />
The plot deviates a little from the usual high-school harem plot in its disposition, but at the heart of it, it’s still a high-school harem, only with girls who aren’t normal. All of the girls introduced in this story are perverts to the truest sense of the word.<br />
<br />
HenSuki doesn’t have a slighter of realism in it. The chances of real people finding themselves in situations that are shown in this show are 1 in 10000. But that’s where HenSuki ticks. You wouldn’t really want to watch things in circumstances that you’re accustomed to. And that’s also what stops HenSuki falling into the same overused category of anime that we’re so used to. Barely though. Make no mistake, HenSuki is filled with tons of the same tropes of similar harem anime: girl falling in love with the guy for a reason that isn’t comprehensible, the guy managing to stop his urges in intimate situations where most teenagers would bust a nut, and the like. <br />
<br />
The characters don’t really change much over the course of the season apart from their fetishes being discovered which is only a problem if you’re watching this for that sort of well thought out storytelling. We’re first introduced to Sayuki Tokihara, Keiki’s senpai who’s also the President of the Calligraphy Club. She’s a beautiful, busty upperclassman who looks normal in the first episode. And that’s the only episode that she looked normal at all. The same could be said about the others: Yuika Koga, the kouhai, Mao Nanjou, the girl in Keiki’s class, and Ayano Fujimoto, the vice-president of the student council. The only girl who’s anywhere close to being normal is Mizuha, Keiki’s little sister.<br />
<br />
The interactions between Keiki and the girls as well as amongst the girls themselves, are reasonably amusing to see. Although I’d have liked if the causes of the development of these fetishes were to be revealed. For one of the girls, the reason is vaguely hinted and I’d have appreciated it more if this was done for the others as well, considering that their desires are actually uncovered pretty early on in the series.<br />
<br />
Art-wise, HenSuki looked pretty good to me. The characters and the backgrounds were all well designed despite being unoriginal. The animation was slightly non-existent at times when the characters conversed, but given the scale of the production studios, I’d say they did a decent enough job with it. I thought they did pretty well with the sound department honestly. All the girls had different soundtracks which really suited their personalities. The opening and ending were alright too. Overall, the production was up to the mark without being great.<br />
<br />
HenSuki managed to be amusing in spite of being surrounded by these clichés. This is kind of “you’ll either love it or absolutely hate it” show. If you want a fun-filled series without too much emphasis on realistic relationships and don’t mind an excess of panty shots and stupidly intimate moments, you might be pleasantly surprised by this series. If you don’t fall in the above category, avoid this show because it has nothing else. All in all, this is a decent entry into the long list of rom-com harems without being too much else.<br />

    I hope you like female characters dressed in slutty animal outfits. I also hope you like anime with girls chasing after a guy 24/7. There’s plenty of trash each year and some of them fall into the harem-ecchi category. Hensuki is about low as trash can go.<br />
<br />
Adapted straight from the light novel, the anime is pretty much self-explanatory on its own. The first episode opens up with the main protagonist Keiki Kiryuu receiving a love letter and panties. It doesn’t take long for him to get into affairs with Sayuki Tokihara, who declares “I want to be your pet!” When the show starts off with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318147">
        such a premise, it makes me wonder how high the author was when they made this. Surely enough, this is the type of wish-fulfilling fairy tale you get straight from a trashy light novel. <br />
<br />
If you ever watched a telenovela before, picture Hensuki as a younger version without the violence and actual love scenes. However, there is adult themes related to panties jokes, animal fetish, and characters that adheres to every harem trope imaginable to the human race. The roster includes:<br />
<br />
Tokihara Sayuki: the classic school beauty with large breasts complete with hairband and masochist personality. <br />
Koga Yuika: Another sadist with a cute smile and blonde hair for the sake of looking cute.<br />
Kiryuu Mizuhara: One of the more normal girls in the show but often finds herself difficult to express her feelings. Think of her as one of those innocent types.<br />
Nanjou Mao: The girl with a loud mouth and seemingly has a fujoshi fetish. <br />
Ootori Koharu: The quiet girl with a reserved nature but that doesn’t stop her from having a perverted personality.<br />
<br />
The main protagonist Kiryuu Keiki is about as dull as a doorknob. Like most healthy boys at his age, his mind is filled with perverted fantasies and it doesn’t help that girls wants to get into his pants. The first few episodes gets him involved into various misadventures with the different girls. There’s not much development between them and the only character chemistry can be described as tasteless. The reality is, the female characters all wants to “serve” Keiki as servants while calling him the “master”. It’s the sort of perverted master-slave relationship the show wants to advertise. To me, it’s a desperate attempt to sell its sex appeal in the show. The female cast has zero personality especially when interacting with Keiki. With every passing episode, the show makes less sense and focuses more on selling its sex appeal than anything else. What a joke.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the show itself is not a parody or satire. It actually seems committed on bringing out some form of meaningful romance development between Keiki and the female cast. Between the sex jokes, animal fetishes, and perverse interactions, the anime attempts to make sort of emotional appeal for the characters. What ends up happening is making the girls look even worse than what they already are. For instance, you’d think someone like Saiyuki can grow to understand Keiki more on a personal level. Instead, she ends up wanting to service Keiki like some sort of masochist fetish. It’s tasteless humor that can be described no less than perverted love. It’s almost if the show is a hentai but manages to avoid being too explicit about it. In the meantime, the storytelling is about as bland as Keiki himself. There’s some elements of “mystery” added in but it all comes down to weak execution. Really, when you have episodes focused on who sent him a pair of “panties”, every fiber of my being wants to turn the TV off.<br />
<br />
Not even the artwork style or animation quality can save the show. The characters look like fake plastic dolls made with the clear intention to arouse the audience. There’s plenty of ecchi content with the amount of boobs and ass. Every main female character is a culprit with the camera enjoying its time to flirt with the clever camera shots. Voice acting doesn’t really hold up to bar either as almost every character sound the same. That won’t matter much anyway since there’s plenty of sexy moans and machoism. <br />
<br />
Hensuki seemed like the type of anime that no one wanted to see being adapted but somehow slipped through the cracks and ended becoming one anyway. There’s so much tasteless humor with a cast degenerate characters. Somehow, I managed to finish this show without stabbing my eyes. This is like a hentai in disguise without the actual sex. And for the love of God, please don’t watch this when you’re family is around. Just watch a hentai instead so it’s easier to explain.

    Short spoiler free review:<br />
<br />
After reading the synopsis and watching the trailer of &quot;Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?&quot; I was expecting nothing other than a Harem/Comedy/Romance/Ecchi/School anime, and it turns out, that&#039;s exactly what I got.<br />
<br />
I will admit that this type of anime has gotten to the point of it being really overused (right after the glorious Isekais of of course), but nonetheless I still enjoy them. I will admit that I consider myself a &quot;tasteless brainlet&quot; when it comes to good quality animes, but I have to say that I really enjoyed &quot;Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?&quot; more than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318145">
        almost any other harem anime out there.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in the typical setting that you would expect any other harem anime to take place in: &quot;A SCHOOL!&quot;. I&#039;m not sure why animes constantly overuse this setting, but what I will tell you is that the story is quite different to all the other harem animes out there, and all the characters have their own unique personality, so you should be able to find that one school girl which you could proudly call your &quot;best girl&quot;.<br />
<br />
Overall, as a trash taste weeb, I&#039;m proudly giving this anime a solid 7/10. If you are a harem loving weeb like me, you should give this anime a go.

    Like many in the anime community, I’ve grown tired of harem anime. Why, because it’s the same crap every single time. A completely average guy gets involved with completely average girls and does absolutely nothing. Typically harem anime are the biggest wastes of time that you can come across. With that being said, occasionally there is a show that can break this formulaic mold. That show is “Kawaikereba Hentai Demo Suki... yada yada yada” or “that one anime airing this season that has HENTAI in its name” <br />
<br />
The story of “HENTAI” is what initially piqued my interest. It sounded like a pervy take on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318142">
        Cinderella story only instead of a white slipper it’s panties. Yes, some girl has left a pair of panties behind and the main character must find out who they belong to. Among the usual suspects are a number of different girls each with their own bizarre fetishes. While the culprit is pretty obvious, it’s fun watching our protagonist try to solve the mystery of which pervert is the biggest of them all. <br />
<br />
This leads into the characters that help to really drive the story forward who by the way look like they came straight from the Doki Doki Literature Club. When it comes to our main character Hensuki, at first I thought he was going to be the typical weak willed protagonist that you see from nearly every harem. But wait, with a title like “HENTAI”, no way is it going to follow the status quo. To my surprise, Hensuki follows along with the girls antics. Not only that but the straight man routine that he does actually plays off well with the eccentric cast of female characters. Speaking of our female cast, I love how each one is unique and strange enough that their act never really grows old as the show goes on. That’s what I love about this show. It’s the chemistry of the main cast combined with the unusual antics becoming comedy gold. Is it stupid? Yes it is, it has “HENTAI” in the name. Doesn’t mean though it can’t be fun. <br />
<br />
With the respect to the art and animation, it works just fine. There’s nothing really spectacular about it. The show is being dually made by the studios Seven and Geek Toys, both of which don’t have that good of a resume, but maybe this is something they can be proud of. As for the character designs, I am still fully convinced that these characters came straight out of the Doki Doki Literature Club and I would not be surprised if they share the same character designer. The music for the show is alright. I did like the fun and upbeat opening song. Ending song is ok I guess. <br />
<br />
With a show featuring “HENTAI” in its name, I wasn’t expecting much. However, maybe because of the low expectations I was able to warm up and appreciate the show for what it was. Whatever the case, this was a good watch from this season and I recommend checking it out.

    This show is interesting in that it fails in a thought-provoking way (two ways, actually). Fail number one is being in the wrong medium. Hensuki is a confused visual novel which does a good job of highlighting that different mediums require different storytelling devices to work. The first four episodes are essentially a long-ass bait-and-switch sequence of School Days/Doki Doki Literature Club variety (although not even remotely that dramatic). They unfold like a gal-ge script written by a neural network - a bland highschooler MC given a harem of bland archetypes just because, going through a bucket list of bland romcom situations. There is even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314109">
        a male friend advisor - a straight-up date-sim gameplay mechanic. But all this schmaltz is just a way to set up what the MC expects out of his school life - and what he doesn’t get, because each and every girl is actually one of the female pervert archetypes - it was an ecchi comedy all along. And this doesn’t work in an episode-once-a-week show because the audience still has to trudge through a month worth of boredom, supposedly to get to “the good stuff,” but there really is no reason to do that.<br />
<br />
Fail number two is not knowing what kind of story you are trying to be. Basically, our generic self-insert is assaulted by multiple Darknesses - but not in a fun way. It is played completely straight, because he’s neither blissfully oblivious, nor chad enough to just roll with it, like you would expect from the two main species of harem protagonists - he’s genuinely dumbfounded and creeped out. And his situation just keeps getting worse. If the show took itself a little bit more seriously, it would’ve been a great psychological horror about a male teenager being harassed by female perverts. However, it insists on being a comedy - which in turn, is not funny because of the way too serious atmosphere. The comedy here follows your basic setup-punchline structure, but it’s a twenty minutes setup for a single punchline per episode.<br />
<br />
4/10. If you like the premise, watch OniSuki for literally the same exact show except done right.

    Having watched more harems than some people have anime in total, I won’t lie, HenSuki’s MAL score makes me sad. As a fan of the genre,  really feel it’s one of the better positions and hope this review can convince at least one person to give it a try.<br />
One thing I should point out straight away is very comedic and light atmosphere of this story. Unlike battle harems that try to have some serious plot at some point or VN adaptations that usually have a drama arc in each route, this is, at least as far as anime goes, pure comedy. And because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318151">
        that I absolutely disagree with any kind of arguments about lack of depth or predictability, be it in story or characters. It’s simple, fanservicey comedy and, in my opinion, does very well in that department.<br />
Now, let’s get to why I rate it over hundreds of other harems… first and foremost all girls have some value. While it’s not nearly-perfect balance like BokuBen, it’s still considerably above average. Add to that rather nice protagonist with some great remarks and reactions, and we are already at the route to very solid harem. Another thing that stands out is art. It seemed like earlier episodes tried to be overly ambitious with camera positioning, but it get better. Character design, on the other hand, is perfect. Their looks and well fitting voice actors automatically made them more memorable and enjoyable to watch.<br />
Last but not the least, is the comedy. It might not be the best out there, far from it. But it’s still above average, even if rather basic and crude. Depends on the taste I guess.<br />
Overall, as I said in the beginning, I find HenSuki to be one of the better harem and wrote this short review as my way of showing appreciation for this show in response to quite negative opinions it got.<br />

    ·Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
From my own experience I can affirm that this is the typical harem/ecchi/fan-service anime. <br />
<br />
The plot of this series is really poor. By far, I have only seen common events that happen in other animes but with that &#039;&#039;fetish&#039;&#039; touch that they add to it.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t seen nothing original or interesting that makes me reconsider the mark that I selected.<br />
<br />
·Art: 5/10<br />
<br />
The art in general hasn&#039;t the best quality (Mediocre), but, as an harem anime, it gets better in the ecchi scenes. <br />
<br />
·Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
The dialogs and music aren&#039;t pretty well selected. <br />
<br />
Putting aside that the anime doesn&#039;t have lots of effects, the majority of them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314203">
        are &#039;&#039;erotic effects?&#039;&#039;, which it suits the show but doesn&#039;t give any input to the anime.<br />
<br />
·Character: 5/10<br />
<br />
What could I say about the mcs?... <br />
<br />
First of all, the male mc has no relevant points about his personality. I can only see the mythical good boy that helps and understands the female mcs.<br />
<br />
The female mcs in general are the most generic characters that we have on this type of animes (Tsunderes and others...)  but the only thing that differences them are their types of fetishes.<br />
<br />
·Enjoyment: 4/10 <br />
<br />
I enjoy the show if I don&#039;t have nothing else to do or see, I usually leave this anime for the last one, as I know I won&#039;t find anything new.<br />
<br />
·Overall: 4/10<br />
<br />
I would only recommend this anime if you have nothing to do, as I said is a fan-service anime with almost nothing new and the only thing you can get from this show is a little bit of entertainment. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading! :D<br />
<br />

    The first episode was so predictable and full of the trope-iest tropes, I put off watching this for a long while.<br />
<br />
Finally I ran out of other stuff to watch and began binge-watching this.<br />
<br />
The first three episodes continued to be boringly trope-y, but by the fourth, it started to take off.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m on the eighth episode and loving it. Good show, lots of laughs. It&#039;s too bad they couldn&#039;t have just started at episode four, but I understand that they had to lay the [predictable] groundwork before it would make sense.<br />
<br />
The characters (especially the girls) are endearing; in spite of their weird fetishes, it&#039;s easy to like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316631">
        them as people and as girls.<br />
<br />
The director could&#039;ve gone over-the-top slapstick with the S &amp; M characters like just about every other anime out there, but these portrayals are charming and sweet.

    Hensuki otherwise known as Pervlove is pretty much what it sounds like. A sort of highschool romantic-comedy, but this time it is centered around more “perverted” characters. And by “perverted” I mean that each of the characters falls into one fetishistic categories such as masochism, sadism, olfactophilia, etc. Many of these fetishes which have already been done before in previous anime, especially masochism and sadism since they both go hand in hand. But Hensuki isn’t here to present something new or to reinvent the wheel. It’s here to be another derivative unabashed light novel harem comedy and nothing more, as mandated by god.<br />
<br />
The plot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318146">
        Hensuki shares all the same commonalities with almost every harem story under the sun, even it’s “mystery”(which in this case are panties) that is the driving force of the show isn’t new. It follows our protagonist Keiki trying to find the wearer of a pair of coveted panties that were laid before him. To him they are the glass slipper that will lead to his personal Cinderella as it is clearly laid out in the show. With only a handful of suspects, many of whom he is already friends with, he ends up finding out more about them than he initially wished. As each of the girls that he tries to investigate quickly reveal some sort of kink with Keiki usually being the center of it, aaaaaand that&#039;s really it for most of the show. Just one new girl with a fetish after another, to the point that the entire Cinderella plot line easily gets sidelined. Because truly the story isn’t about the girl at the destination, but the harem that was made along the way. The mystery does get solved in the end and it’s so obvious due to the show trying to make it the least obvious. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, I&#039;ll have you know that they aren’t just one note fetish machines, they also have one note personalities as well. The only two girls of note are the masochist senpai, sayuki and the sadist kohai, Yuika since they are the most prominent of all the girls. And honestly it makes since for these two girls to be the main showcase of the entire show as they are the exact opposite of each other in almost every way.  They are the yin and the yang, the opposing yet balanced forces of the universe. They represent the philosophical and moral dilemmas that we face on a daily basis. To either be subservient or to be domineering, to be the ruler or the ruled, to spank or be spanked, and usually sticking with one our entire lives. Keike then serves as the conduit of this human condition, and instead of choosing one or the other he instead rises above it all. He, like many harem protagonists, becomes the Ubermensch in the guise of the Last man by just being a nice guy. It’s by this niceness that the girls love him. It’s because of this niceness that Sayuki want’s Keiki to dominate her, because she knows he will never hurt her. It’s that niceness that let’s Yuika make Keiki her servant because she knows he will never be resentful. And it’s that niceness that Keiki is fine with Mao using him as source material for her bl manga. It may sound a bit preposterous that despite so many girls fonding over him, he never goes after any of them and ditch the panties. But that’s the thing, those panties are his will to power, they are what drives him as a human and for the show to exist for 9 more episodes. <br />
Neitzsche more like Beitzsche.<br />
<br />
This show was made by two studios. The main one being, Geek Toys, an up and coming studio who aren’t really worth talking about. The other studio however is studio Seven, a studio that has some mediocre anime but it has some A+ hentai. It’s the main reason when watching this show that it has that weird feeling to it that it should have been a hentai, Besides the fetishes of course. The color pallet, the shading, the character designs, the animation, the directing, the camera angles and composition, all of it just screams HENTAI!!! And the reason why this all culminates into it having a hentai like feel is because it does look like a Seven’s hentai work, especially that of Nishikawa, Takashi. Takashi being one of the more prominent Hentai creators at the studio who created masterful works such as Otome Dori, Rance, Baku Ane, and so much more. Once you have seen one of his works it is impossible to not see how his creative genius had seeped into this anime. His creative influence is so potent and recognizable that even just looking at the color pallet  of the show was able to give me a hard on. However as an anime it could only go so far in its ecchi-ness without being down right provocative. In the end, all that was left for me was a boner on my lap but nowhere to go :’(.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh, the soundtrack is kind of decent although it can be annoying to some.

    I hoped against all hope that what ended up happening didn&#039;t happen.<br />
I was a fool, do not be a fool like me.<br />
The art wasn&#039;t bad tho.<br />
MC needs to understand he&#039;s not the only one allowed to have a fetish. Honestly what the heck did he expect from a girl who left him her panties? We all love a good old oblivious MC, but this is getting ridiculous.<br />
He is right about one thing: all oppai are precious.<br />
Also, these bath towels just keep on dropping huh? I should&#039;ve known from the title there would be repetitive towel dropping scenes.

    Ahhh high school romance anime, how you never seem to go away. It takes a lot these days for high school romance anime to stand out from the crowd. But when you consider how many high school anime we’ve had, it better try and stand out. There are three ways. One, have strong writing and characters for the viewer to get attached to. Two, have some kind of gimmick that intrigues the viewer. Or three, do both one and two. This show falls under number two, where it tries to use  a gimmick to entertain the audience. The results are mixed to say the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318157">
        least. <br />
<br />
Sit back relax and flip every girl’s skirt to find your secret admirer as I present to you the anime review for, *ahem* Hensuki: Are you willing to fall in love with a pervert, as long as she’s a cutie? (Yeah you can really tell this was based off a light novel, can’t you?) Lets begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
Our story follows Keiki Kiryuu, a highschooler whose in a bit of a slump because he doesn’t have a girlfriend despite being around three girls named Sayuki Tokihara, Yuika Koga and Mao Nanjou, who are his friends and his sister Mizuha Kiryuu. But one day, Keiki receives a love letter and a fresh pair of white, girl panties. With the girls surrounding him acting weird, Keiki is determined to find out who is the “Cinderella” that sent him the love letter and panties. But as he investigates, he learns that these girls are more than meets the eye. <br />
<br />
This pretty much sets the stage for what is to follow. The love letter acts as the plot device used in order to know the girls better. But it isn’t the main focus of the show as it is only one half of the show. The other half of this show is the girls themselves and each having their own kink. This is where the ecchi element comes in as each girl has a secret that they confess to Keiki because of how much of a nice guy he is. The show relies on this shock factor of each girl’s kink to keep the viewer watching and finding out the other girl’s kinks. The problem is that once you see it once or twice, then it doesn’t really work because then you would be expecting that each girl has some weird kink. The show doesn’t change how it introduces them so really, you are just waiting for the kink to be revealed, making the episode before the reveal rather boring because the show doesn’t have much going for it besides these kinks. <br />
<br />
Of course that is just one half of the show, the other half is the mystery of the love letter. But honestly, outside of the last 3-4 episodes, I didn’t really care. The mystery was pushed to the wayside just so we can focus on the kinks these girls have. But when they bring it back to the spotlight, it does get interesting as Keiki starts to narrow it down as to who is the “Cinderella,” the nickname Keiki and his best friend Shouna came up with. I start to get intrigued as to who it might be as we know all of the girls now. But the answer revealed is perhaps the most anime answer this show could have given and is just a cliché at this point. It is safe to say that I find the answer to be very underwhelming.  <br />
<br />
The show’s humour is very much on the crude side as it should be expected given the nature of this show but this kind of humour is rather subjective. You either find it funny or you don’t. But there is a fine line when crude humour is funny and when crude humour is cringe worthy. I say this because the show never feels like it comes close to that line. It does a couple of times but the humour is more tame than I expected it to be. For most of the show, I was waiting for it to go balls deep but it hardly ever does. Considering these kinks, you would think that it would be more daring but again, it hardly ever does, only very sparlingly. Also throughout the show, it felt like I was forcing myself to chuckle and laugh at this show which is never really a good sign for a show that is trying to humour you. <br />
<br />
Characters: 4/10<br />
<br />
Well it wouldn’t be a high school anime without a standard high school protagonist so in this case, Keiki takes this role. But seriously, the only thing Keiki has going for him is that he isn’t afraid to say no unlike other protagonists in this position. Other than that, he doesn’t really stand out due to him being rather generic and is also rather boring as his personality is rather dry and predicable for a protagonist in this position. For a comedy series, having a protagonist that doesn’t entertain you is a problem because this is the character that’s going to get the most screen time. <br />
<br />
The girls don’t have much going for them either. Outside of their kinks, they don’t really have much of a personality. They generally fall under stereotypes to help differentiate themselves but I think that their kinks would have done that anyway in helping differentiating each other; which, trust me, they do. The show never really elaborates as to why they have these kinks which I think could help expand their character. But they don’t. With the exception of Koharu, they are just gimmicks for the sake of this show just having a gimmick and for some added shock value. A couple of the girls do get brief backstories as to why they have feeling for Keiki which does help justify the love letter so they do get some development when they open up to Keiki, but that’s it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 2/10<br />
<br />
There is a case for a show looking to bright for its own good and this is a great example here. I really don’t like this show’s art style. The fact is that it really is too bright and bubbly that it becomes an eyesore at times. I get what they were trying to do which is to keep it light hearted but they tried too much and it looks rather bad. Same can be said for the character designs as each character has this wet, glisten hair look that makes it look like they just washed it. It makes their whole designs rather jarring and strengthens the fact that this art style isn’t good. The only thing I like is the girl’s eyes as they have a pretty colour look to them and are unique to each girl. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 2/10<br />
<br />
There was one soundtrack that did out that is normally played when there some big comedic reveal, especially when the girls reveal their kinks and you hear this tune to make it sound more sexual. It’s the only soundtrack that stands out from this series due to how well its used and when it is used. The rest of the soundtrack didn’t stand out and is pretty forgettable in my opinion. I couldn’t recall any others besides the one I already mentioned. Mainly because it doesn’t really sound unique to make it stand out so it just blends into the background.  <br />
<br />
I’ll be honest, I skipped the opening and ending for this show after watching both of them two times. The opening, “Daisuki” by Ayaka Ohashi sounds pretty generic for a high school anime opening and the visuals are a bit of a mismatch when it comes to the show as we get showed a lot of random stuff that has no correlation to the show. It’s quite a mess of trying to add stuff to the opening to make it as fun as possible, but it comes across as being untidy. <br />
<br />
The ending, “Mubyuu no Hana” by Mia Regina portrays a prince trying to rescue “Cinderella” from an evil monster, even though that’s not anywhere near the story of Cinderella. But the ending sounds really slow for an ending sequence is paced like one as well. I get that they were trying to portray the Prince finding his love but it did not interest me mainly due to how slow it was and being visually unimpressive. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
I think if a comedic show fails to make me laugh, then we have some problems. The show relies too much on its gimmick to make it entertaining and it comes across at the end as being quite a boring show. Despite the girls kinks, they never take it far enough to the point where you can’t help yourself but laugh at the ridiculousness of it. It became a case of expecting these things to happen which ruined any chance of getting surprised in order to amuse me. Well when I did look a the screen due to the art style being an eyesore. I expected this show to be dumb fun but I wasn’t having fun watching it. It was more tedious than anything. With all that being said, it’s probably worth skipping this and probably watch something like Shimoneta instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
My personal enjoyment: 2.5/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 2.7/10 Recommendation: Don’t Bother

    Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka? or Synonyms: Would you love a pervert as long as she&#039;s cute? or in short &quot;Hem Suki.&quot; Another harem themed anime has ended.<br />
<br />
So<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Pros: It may be a generic harem based anime , but then again, the usual  always involves a guy who would be the obnoxious one to them girls, but in this anime it&#039;s them girls who were the obnoxious ones .<br />
<br />
-The romance wasn&#039;t limited to just the guy, in fact there is another guy who has his own share of the harem pie and yes, he was also as obnoxious as the girl he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318150">
        was with.<br />
<br />
Cons: It still involves the usual oblivious guy who doesn&#039;t know what to do with his harem.<br />
<br />
Verdict 7/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />

Character<br />
<br />
Pros: Unlike the usual harem themed anime, were them girls would be composed of the ff: Yamato Nadeshiko, Bokuko, Osananajimi, tsundere and a loli, here we have a Masochistic Sempai, a Sadistic Kohai, a BL loving tsundere, a stalker Loli sempai, a Smell loving School VP, a Loli loving Bestie, and a Brocon imouto , but later on she turns out to bean exhibitionist, as the title suggest all were perverts that makes this quite unique.<br />

Verdict  7/10<br />

It maybe a generic harem theme anime but for studio  Seven and GEEKTOYS to choose this to have an anime adaptation  was a good move for their part. Also original creator Hanama, Tomo to used a different set of female characters as oppose to the usual harem themed anime was a good move for his or her part, but good as it was we still can&#039;t deny that this was still a harem anime, but then again, thought vague, we can say that the guy chooses his sister who also has some from of perversion .

    I dropped this show after episode 1, and it&#039;s not just because of the fanservice. This is the most shallow harem I have ever seen in my life.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s one thing for the MC to be plainly nice, but this MC is the worst. He&#039;s a shallow human being whose only thought was &quot;I want a girlfriend.&quot; No taste. No ambition. No other defining trait. Just that ridiculous desire. I can&#039;t help but wonder what did anyone see in him. The female characters on the other hand were no better. Their personality traits seem to not only stick to an archetype, but the way they want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366037">
        to be treated by the MC. One is a sadist, the other a masochist, etc etc.<br />
<br />
This is downright disgusting and seems to fetishize unhealthy relationships. There&#039;s nothing great about torturing or being tortured by your love interest. And don&#039;t get me started with the secret &quot;Cinderella&quot;. The &quot;glass slipper&quot; is repulsing.<br />
<br />
The only positive thing I could say about this show is that the art and character designs are very pretty.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I dislike this show and threw it into a fire.

    *Short no spoiler review<br />
<br />
This is my first review so go easy on me. <br />
<br />
I came into this show expecting a tongue in cheek, lighthearted, fun harem anime, and that&#039;s exactly what I got. Nothing more. Nothing less. Hensuki is really good at what it does, but not really anything else. You can&#039;t go into this show expecting anything, but if you come into this show because you are looking for a self aware harem, you will have a lot of enjoyment. It doesn&#039;t pretend to be deep, and there is almost no drama, or it is very light on the backstory. There are a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322840">
        of things that you have to overlook, but if you can overlook them, your enjoyment will great. The characters are fun, every girl is a good option (except maybe one), and the protagonist obviously has some influence from Ararag (Monogatari series), and Sakuta (Bunny girl senpai), and that makes for a cooler dynamic rather than the protagonist getting flustered every 30 seconds. My only two qualms with the show that actually hang over me are: 1. The ending was sub-par, but still not terrible. 2. There was a really ambiguous relationship, that was barely explored. I give &quot;Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?&quot; a 7 (if i&#039;m being generous) from a technical standpoint, and a 9 from an enjoyment standpoint. <br />

    I recently watched Hensuki and thought &quot;It&#039;s just another harem series I guess I&#039;ll watch it&quot; and I didn&#039;t have high expectations and thought it would be average but boy was I wrong. I was surprised to see the main protagonist actually has a personality! He&#039;s not just a cardboard box he actually feels like a real character. I also like that this series doesn&#039;t have that one &quot;main girl&quot; the one you know will win at the end instead almost all the girls get an equal amount of screen time and it&#039;s not obvious on who will win the mc over. I also liked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320364">
        that the show just doesn&#039;t focus on the mc romance instead he helps his (spoiler) and his best friend with trying to express their feelings to each other and have them be a couple even though there&#039;s a big conflict that could separate them. Lastly, I thought the mystery on who wrote him the love letter and left their panties was executed well but it became obvious around the middle of the series on who it would be but the ride to get there was great. Overall I definitely recommend Hensuki that&#039;s looking for a good and underrated anime to watch that has some good fanservice and mystery. I hope that Geek Toys &amp; Seven make a season 2 due to what happens at the end because this definitely needs a sequel.

    *SPOILER FREE REVIEW*<br />
<br />
Before I start this review, I should note that I have yet to finish the series, because I&#039;m watching the english dub of the show. The reason why I&#039;m writing it now, is becauese I wanna get this review out there before it gets buried under the popular ones. With that being said, lets start the review.<br />
<br />
So, before I get into the plot, I need to get something off my chest. And that is the reason why the average score for this anime is under a 7. Now, this is going to be like a full on rant. Feel free to skip to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318177">
        the paragraph below if you dont really care about this subject. But I do reccomend you read what I have to say. So, these days, if there&#039;s an ecchi anime airing, people are quick to discredit it, because it&#039;s ecchi. I have a problem with that. If you dont like ecchi, thats completly fine, but if you go in to an anime, knowing FULL well that what you&#039;re watching is gonna have fan service, DONT WATCH IT. Because you&#039;re just gonna end up not enjoying the show, and giving it a low score, witch inevitably ruins the average score. But theres a group worse than those people. The people I&#039;m talking about is the &quot;It&#039;s ecchi, so its bad&quot; band wagon. These are the people who actually somewhat enjoy the anime, but they give it a low score, because they dont wanna admit they liked a show what has fan service in it. All they wanna do, is have the trending opinion. Dont do this. If you actually liked the show, then give it the score you actually think it deserves. Another thing too; dont go into an ecchi romcom, and expect some in-depth plot. Just accept it for what it is. Rant over. If you think my points are wrong, feel free to to tell me in my profile&#039;s comments section. I&#039;d be happy to hear what you think. Becuase in the end, it&#039;s just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Story: (7/10)<br />
<br />
The story follows your average high school student named keiki. He one day receives a love letter, what also came with a pair of panties. Keiki makes it his mission to find the person who gave him this love letter. That&#039;s just a basic run down on the plot; now for my opinions.<br />
<br />
I actually do like the direction the story heads in this anime. With a crazy plot like that, you&#039;re bound to have some laughs along the way. Keiki gets himself wrapped up in such things as black mail, being a slave, butler, ect. All to find true love. I know theres not really much I could say about the plot, but if I said anymore. I&#039;d have to spoil things, whats better to experience for yourself. <br />
<br />
Art: (5/10) <br />
<br />
The art is fine, I guess. Theres nothing really special or unique about it. They&#039;re just your average people you&#039;d see in any other romcom. The animation is fine too, I guess.<br />
<br />
Sound: (8/10)<br />
<br />
I liked the opening song, very catchy, and something I&#039;d download. The ending song is decent, but thats just my opinion. Not really much to say on sound.<br />
<br />
Character: (9/10)<br />
<br />
The characters are by far the best part of this anime. My favorite being the MC, Keiki. Although Keiki may look like your generic harem protaginist, he&#039;s.... uh....not? I dont know to be honest, but lets just say he&#039;s not the type to be perverted, or blush over some cleavage. This guy just wants to find who gave him that love letter. The girls all have their unique personalities, and dare I say it &quot;fetishes&quot;. But, I&#039;ll leave it up to you to know what I mean by that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (9/10)<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this anime. As a fan of romantic comedies, this anime was for me, but if you&#039;re not a fan of that, then I cant reccomend it. But if you are, then I can reccomend this anime for you. I loved the characters, enjoyed the story, and liked the opening song. Definitely an underrated anime in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Final Score: (9/10)<br />
<br />
**EDIT**<br />
<br />
Ignore EVERYTHING I said. I just finished episode 11, and they ruined it. I give this anime my vintage score of... 4/10.

    This show is trash and so am I<br />
<br />
Go into this show knowing its trashy but you will find out the show is actually very funny and has a decent plot. <br />
<br />
The characters are fairly well written and they all have their &quot;quirks&quot; and that makes the show better because it&#039;s like if you were to take a every day guy and make 6 female Jostar&#039;s fall in love with him all at once.<br />
<br />
The ending wasn&#039;t what i wanted but if you wait till after the end credits, it will leave you satisfied. <br />
<br />
This is a fun show and I don&#039;t see how people are giving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327258">
        it a bad rating. Maybe if you don&#039;t like the premise of the show but I don&#039;t see how people read the title and didn&#039;t expect to see perverted stuff and fan service. The show has &quot;hentai&quot; in the title LOL

    My first review...so here goes!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to review this anime in the traditional sense, I&#039;m not going to review this in sections (story, art, sound, etc.). That&#039;s because I have my own criteria to base my judgement on.<br />
<br />
Now, perhaps the most important character in this anime, who holds together the plot and shapes the events to come, the protagonist lacks character and emotional resonance. His lack of visual appeal (an indicator of the anime&#039;s quality), and perverted nature are cliched and uninspiring. Especially in 2019, where new anime creators and series are rapidly emerging, it is of the utmost importance that studios distinguish themselves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324381">
        from others, not through fan service, not through large-busted female characters, not even through their title, but through relatable, memorable experiences.<br />
<br />
Hensuki&#039;s plot comes off as whimsical and unrealistic, much like hentai these days, with the exploration of the protagonist&#039;s sexual fantasies. Of course, this is great for audiences, most who are young male clientele, and are looking for gratification, perhaps even in the carnal sense. The plot, loosely based off Cinderella, demonstrates how little the authors of the anime, really understand about a good harem anime. Even the animation demonstrates limited effort on the part of the animators, maybe due to overwork, maybe due to inexperience, or maybe overlooked in lieu of the disgraceful (if existent) plot.<br />
<br />
The anime falls into the same traps of previous harem anime, and so carries with it a monotonous, dull spirit. Saved in part by Ayaka Ohashi&#039;s voracious performance of the opening, Daisuki, and perhaps to a lesser extent with its ending song, the anime nonetheless fails to break conventions of harem anime. A failure in part due to wanting to please its audience, Hensuki overall is uninspiring, its only entertainment value of numerous sexual fantasies and panty shots for depraved young audiences. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not on par with other anime and also has the usual fanservice elements which bring it down. I really liked the opening song, though I felt like the anime didn&#039;t really deserve such a well-written opening song.<br />

    You know what  I like about this show?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just so much fun to watch<br />
<br />
There are some people saying &quot;this another one of those harem show ect.&quot;, but nope! Never regretted watching this show<br />
<br />
Having watching my fair share of harem genre, I found them much more boring than this show, because this is one of those shows that screams &quot;we don&#039;t care about this, we don&#039;t care about that.&quot;<br />
&quot;We just want our viewers to have fun watching this&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
and I really really liked the atmosphere it tried to convey<br />
<br />
Trust me, you won&#039;t regret watching it <br />
<br />

    Hensuki was way better than it had any right to be.<br />
<br />
You can probably imagine the mentality that I had when I started this series. &quot;Oh look, another ecchi harem rom-com. Great&quot;. Yeah, needless to say, I wasn&#039;t expecting much. The premise of the show made this feeling even worse. However, my expectations were crushed and hit way out of the ballpark. For a while I was considering giving this anime a 10/10. Unfortunately, it didn&#039;t quite live up to that standard by the end. <br />
<br />
Since I&#039;ve gotten bored of my old review format, I&#039;ll just list the pros and cons and add extra thoughts at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318152">
        the end.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
The art is above average, though, it does drop in quality by the end of the show.<br />
The pacing of the show is great. It keeps the mystery compelling until the end.<br />
The show is pretty funny.<br />
The characters are marvelous. This is Hensuki&#039;s greatest strength.<br />
<br />
Cons: <br />
<br />
The show&#039;s quality deteriorates overtime in almost all aspects. This doesn&#039;t make it unwatchable, but this is the reason why I dropped the rating from 10 to 9.<br />
The reveal is rather unsatisfying, though, the end of the show kind of makes up for it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would recommend that you watch Hensuki. It&#039;s a really good watch. Just make sure that you lock your doors.
