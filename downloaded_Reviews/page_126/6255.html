    I don&#039;t really wanna review Sonic X. What about you, Tails? Do you want to? (Tails staring at me bored and pissed) Well...... Sorry Tails, I have to do this anyway. We all know Sonic. He&#039;s the badass mascot of SEGA that spawned in the Genesis in the 90&#039;s and became a pop culture phenomenon. When news began of a Sonic anime in the works, fans were thrilled with excitement and maybe Sonic can translate well into anime. But then came 4Kids! and...... The results were not pretty. Hated by both Sonic and anime fans, Sonic X was a huge failure among fans of Sonic,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55799">
        due to ridiculous plot, ripping off other animes and terrible new characters.<br />
<br />
Sonic X begins with, who else, Sonic and his friends going to Dr. Eggman&#039;s base to rescue Cream and her Chao, when a nuclear reaction on the Chaos Emerald exploded and sending Sonic and his pals to Earth. That makes sense right guys?..... Moving on. After the weird explosion, Sonic gets chased by cops and ends up falling into the pool of a kid&#039;s house named Chris Thorndyke, a 10-year-old boy who lives with his grandfather Chuck and her maid Ella. So in the first season, it begins with a bang and then it goes a little bit strange for me. First, why the hell did Sonic and his friends end on Earth? DIdn&#039;t the place that they live is basically Earth? If not, then what&#039;s the name of their world then?! (although they did explain this in the second season of Sonic X, but the way they explain it is messed up). Second, how can a Chaos Emerald send you trough time? Cause that was never even in the games and things get even crazier in the second season of Sonic X, when they introduced another new character Cosmo and boy, they crammed up a lot of story into Season 2, cause the amount of backstory that they give to the plot in Sonic X just screams epic bullshit all the way in my opinion. Also, i found out that Sonic X in Japan was more violent and bloody than the US version, they even show Sonic bleeding while in a fight with Shadow in the Japanese version and hearing both Sonic and Tails swear a lot in the Japanese version, as well as Amy saying &quot;Fuck&quot;. It was so controversial that 4Kids! edited the living crap out of Sonic X, so that it may receive a TV-Y7 rating in the US.<br />
<br />
There are some things that I really like about Sonic X. First the animation. While it&#039;s not really perfect and there are a few incredibly bland backgrounds at times, the art and character models do look really good and fluid. Character models really bring the Sonic feel to life and they really work on each of the characters personalities from the game into the anime. the sense of speed really goes perfectly with the art and it really looks damn good on screen. Also, i like how the creators are, at least, giving some of this characters some depth to it, where many other Sonic games failed. There&#039;s one part where Sonic comes to see Amy, but Amy gets angry at him cause he always left her without telling her and then Sonic actually gives a Rose, apologizes to her and telling Amy that he would actually stay with her by the end of the world in the Jap version! Holy shit, Sonic, that&#039;s pretty damn deep. Also in the Jap version, the character development in Shadow was really great and I really can&#039;t believe i care for the guy, but really I just did. To be fair as well, while this anime does sometimes rips off some cliches from animes, it does deliver some very funny moments that make Sonic X worth the time to enjoy.<br />
<br />
Now the main reason I think Sonic X fails is because of the shitty English dub and dialogue script that 4Kids! wrote for the US version of Sonic X (in which I do agree on). Voice-acting can be a hit or miss and it does fit the voices for each character, but sometimes the English voices can be extremely corny and cheesy and hell and the terrible script for the 4Kids! version ruins the show. It often feels rushed and really ruining some of the character development by making it too damn simple, i mean, really, couldn&#039;t they write something better than the script that these voice-actors were given to do?. Also, characters like Chris, Cosmo and etc. are really bland and useless. Chris looks like Sora from Kingdom Hearts and basically, he&#039;s just there to be a buddy with Sonic, nothing more and Cosmo is just for Tails to have a love interest, just like Sonic and Amy.<br />
<br />
If you wanna see Sonic X, see the Japanese version instead. It has better English subtitles dialouge and some nice character development to it. I don&#039;t recommend the English dub, cause 4Kids! really ruined it by cutting too much plot from the Japanese version and just rushing the series for a quick-buck. If Sonic X was dubbed by Funimation instead of 4Kids!, it would have been so much better for Sonic X, cause Funimation only does little editing on animes all the damn time. It&#039;s not the greatest thing ever, but it&#039;s definitely not the worst thing ever made, it&#039;s actually pretty enjoyable and it worth the interest if you like, but please, see the Japanese version, not the 4Kids! one.... Thank you.<br />

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Few names in the history of video games have raised controversy and fierce arguments like Sonic the Hedgehog. In the early 1990s, Sonic was almost universally beloved. His games were fast, simple, and fun. They didn&#039;t have the massive number of worlds, secrets, and re-playability that Super Mario for SNES had, but they were the best thing on the Genesis/Masterdrive system...other than Rocket Knight Adventures of course. However, since the Sega Saturn came out, Sonic has starred in a lot of REALLY horrible games including: Sonic R, Sonic Fighters, Sonic Shuffle, Sonic 06, Sonic Free Riders, Sonic Boom: the Rise Lyric etc. At this point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182217">
        Sonic is an absolute joke and most Sonic fans are angry Sega kids in their late 20s and early 30s driven by nostalgia, bitterness, and a refusal to admit they should have just bought a SNES. &quot;Shut up you damn kids! Sonic is good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Why would I even review a Sonic anime? Simply put, I was a Sega kid. During the late 80s and early 1990s, there was a resentment of Japan in the US caused by fear of Japan&#039;s rapidly growing economy, similar to how Americans feel about China now. Few Americans disliked Japan more than my old man, largely thanks to his partially Chinese heritage. Whereas the SNES was filled with anime inspired JRPGs and fully embraced its Japanese origin, Sega in the US focused on sports games, beat em ups, and if you didn&#039;t know better (my dad didn&#039;t) you would think Sega was a real, red blooded American company. Even though retrospectively the SNES was a superior system in graphics, sound, game library and every other category, I ended up with a Sega genesis because MURICA! ...Even though Sega is in fact a Japanese company. My friends got to play games that revolutionized storytelling in video games like Final Fantasy 6, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, etc. I got to play really primitive football games where the playbook complexity was at the level of &quot;run play&quot; or &quot;pass play&quot;, all the teams had the same stats, and you were lucky if they even had the real team names, let alone the player names. I got to play platformers with NO draw distance like Tazmania, where everything is trial and error rather than actual skill. I got to enjoy inferior ports of games with 1/2 the levels and quality of their SNES counterparts like Sunset Riders and Hyperstone Heist.  If you were a dumb jock who was around college age in the early 1990s, the Sega Genesis was a passable system. Otherwise it fucking SUCKED! We Sega kids are so forgiving and dedicated towards Sonic because he was basically ALL we had God Damn it! Other than Sparkster-Sama the Rocket Knight of course (Peace be upon Him).<br />
<br />
Story and characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
The story is that Sonic, Robotnik, and all the other Sonic characters get teleported to Earth thanks to a bullshit plot device and Sonic must team up with a young boy named Chris and his other human friends to stop Robotnik (Eggman), retrieve the chaos emeralds, and return home. That sounds pretty simple right? The problem with Sonic X, like the later Sonic games is that they feel the need to try tell a ridiculously convoluted story and end up failing miserably. Sonic was never really about the story in the first place! Stop trying to make Sonic into Final Fantasy! The best story for any Sonic game or show was easily the American cartoon Sonic SatAm, which kept a fairly simple premise, didn&#039;t have a million worthless characters, and focused on the theme of environmental preservation vs. industrialization. Sonic didn&#039;t have lots of human sidekicks because the only humans were Robotnik and his assistant, who had taken over Sonic&#039;s world and were rapidly destroying the planet&#039;s environment and turning the animals into robots. The quality came not from how mindblowing the story itself was, but HOW the story was told and the overall tone and world the show created. There was no need for ancient deities, time travel, and worthless friends like &quot;Vector the Crocodile&quot;. Sonic Team should have realized that overly complex sub-plots and extra sidekicks wasn&#039;t improving the quality, but they keep reaching for the stove and getting burned over and over again! After the first couple seasons, the show could have ended with a small fragment of decency. Instead we get a time skip and a completely unnecessary 3rd season that more than jumped the shark. It would be more accurate to say it pulled a Dr. Strangeglove and cheerfully rode the A-bomb into oblivion.<br />
<br />
Art: 2/10<br />
<br />
Let me be real honest here. Sonic X looks like crap. I don&#039;t like the human art models, I don&#039;t like the animal character models, I thought the animation was atrocious. I really don&#039;t have anything positive to say on this topic.<br />
<br />
Sound: 3/10<br />
<br />
Sonic may have had some faults, but Sonic games have traditionally had AMAZING quality soundtracks. The Sonic OSTs for Sonic 1, 2, 3, and Sonic and Knuckles are some of the catchiest, most awesome video game music ever written. Even Michael Jackson himself helped compose the soundtrack for Sonic 3! How is the music in Sonic X?  Lets just say it REALLY doesn&#039;t live up to the legacy of Sonic music.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
<br />
Sonic X did NOTHING to help breathe new life into the ailing Sonic franchise. I stand with the majority of critics in my opinion that at this point, Sonic should be taken out back and put out of his misery like Old Yeller. The only entertainment you can get out of this show is that the voice actors for the American dub are the same poor sons of bitches that had to dub the Video Brinquedo (Brazilian Pixar) knockoff cartoons. Every time Robotnik says anything I want to chime in &quot;precisely&quot;. Cookie if you get that last joke. Even though this series was aimed at children, I can&#039;t honestly recommend this one to young viewers, old Sonic fans, or really anyone else. Other than maybe extreme masochists.

    There&#039;s something to be said when a Sonic fan hates a Sonic show so much that they have to write a review on a public website so that other people can see it and (most likely) disagree. But let me say this clearly: I am a huge Sonic the Hedgehog fan and I hate this show.<br />
<br />
Why do I hate this show so much? Well, let&#039;s compare it to the best Sonic TV Show ever, Sonic SatAM.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Sonic X: well... maybe like, 5 out of 10.<br />
Sonic SatAM: 9/10<br />
<br />
Any of you who remember Sonic SatAM know that the storyline was  pretty intense while still at the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21729">
        time being humorous. It could balance seriousness and comedy and that was something that made the show so good. I mean, the show was about pollution for the most part, but Sonic and the others DID talk about other things AND created comedy out of the situation. You might not have realized you were learning about the environment, and you probably weren&#039;t really. But I&#039;m sure that you saw Robotnik&#039;s home and thought &#039;Ew gross, jeez, I hope this doesn&#039;t happen where I&#039;m from&#039; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Sonic X, I have to say starts off with a decent plot but only if you know the characters already. If you just come in, they show you all the characters, but you don&#039;t really know them. I think that the original two arcs for this series is chronicled in the two games Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 (SADX and SA2B for Gamecube players). Well, the games are better than the series itself, but for the most part, the stories are the same. But the characters do play a part in the plot, so I can&#039;t say that I can put the plot up high, like I would if we were just talking about the game.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Sonic SatAM: For me 8/10<br />
Sonic X: For me, 6/10<br />
<br />
This really depends on which Sonic you like better, honestly. They&#039;re drawn in two different styles and I prefer the older Sonic to the newer one. The art is pretty clean in Sonic X. It&#039;s also pretty good in Sonic SatAM. I think the backdrops in both are really good, and the character design again, really depends on which Sonic you like. Same with all the other characters. The only character that would make any real difference is probably Robotnik, as known as Eggman (Why?). I think his design was the most radical change ever (since he went from pointy headed with small, red eyes to... well, Eggman). Honestly, I like the newer Robotnik (Eggman) better. The Older one just was creepy. Although hilarious.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Sonic SatAM: 10/10<br />
Sonic X: skklfjklsadjfkjdakkkkkk<br />
<br />
Opening themes:<br />
Sonic SatAM has THE BEST OPENING EVER. Like seriously, how could you not get pumped for the show when you heard it? If you weren&#039;t thrilled by the theme itself, you could get excited watching the opening animation itself. So there you go.<br />
While Sonic X&#039;s animation is pretty intense for reasons I can&#039;t explain other than running everywhere all the time, I can also say that the theme song is pretty meh. It reminds me of the Yu-Gi-Oh one or the Digimon one, only not executed well. The premise behind these themes is just to repeat the name of the show over and over again in the hopes that you&#039;ll remember the show with only a few other words that aren&#039;t like &quot;Digimon&#039; or whatever. Sonic X tries to do that, but it&#039;s not really well executed. I moreso got annoyed. There&#039;s only so many times I can here &quot;gotta go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster&quot; before I want to skip to the commercials for relief. But sometimes I&#039;m really stoked when I hear it, like, &quot;AW MAN I LOVE THIS&quot; and sometimes I&#039;m just like &quot;Eh.&quot; And I really can&#039;t say that it&#039;s because the song is bad. I can&#039;t say that it&#039;s because it&#039;s good. So I don&#039;t know how to rate this. I just know that I&#039;m a fan of the opening theme for the most part.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Both series have their pitfalls, but I will give them both a pretty high score for voice acting, even if I don&#039;t think some characters matched their voices. As always, Knuckles is a favorite character and most people AGREE with his voice actor. Big sucks, but his voice did match his absolute suckiness. Amy&#039;s voice actor was good too. Rouge also. Only one voice would grate at my nerves for hours on end, CHRIS. And since he was in PRETTY MUCH EVERY EPISODE, everyone sounded okay in comparison, as long as he shut up.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Sonic SatAM: 7/10<br />
Sonic X: 2/10<br />

This is where Sonic SatAm can dull a little bit. Sonic SatAM consists of a wide range of characters, in what I call Sonic Syndrome. SEGA shows that they can&#039;t leave Sonic well enough alone by constantly adding new characters to the games without any real reason and then dropping them forever afterwards. Granted, all the characters in Sonic SatAM are in the comic series... but it&#039;s still sort of like &quot;Do any of these guys do anything but wait around for Sonic?&quot; And everyone always hates on Tails, but he&#039;s one of the only characters who is CONSISTENT in the series. Props, Tails. Props. <br />
<br />
Sonic X has the biggest case of  Pretentious Sonic Syndrome-- adding characters to the series and then acting like those characters are so totally canon. Prime Example: CHRIS AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. If you played the games, when you watch the show, you&#039;re like, &quot;What the fuck is this? Who thought this was a good idea? Why? Why?&quot; Yes, we get that Sonic enters &#039;our world&#039;, but he never befriends a human to the point of living with him. I guess you could say that a hole in the plot of the games is that everything seems to take place in just about one or two days... but that&#039;s the entire point. Sonic is fast. When he saves the world, he does it quickly. He doesn&#039;t need Chris or Chuck or any of that stuff. And Chris isn&#039;t even well written, in my opinion. I don&#039;t know, I would just play the game at that point.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Sonic SatAM: 10/10<br />
Sonic x: 1/10<br />
<br />
No, I&#039;m not going to be nice. I hate Sonic X. HATE. I went in thinking it would be good and, like any good Sonic fan, I defended the hell out of this show. But I blame 4Kids for the lack of creative process put into the show, and I honestly hope no one watches this  because holy crap, it is terrible. It&#039;s not even that the premise is bad, it&#039;s that it was executed terribly despite 4Kids having the thing set up in front of them. Seriously. The series was RIGHT THERE, already written out in all of it&#039;s fantastic gaming glory but no one thought to themselves, &quot;Hey, the people who watch this because they like Sonic are gonna get really pissed off.&quot; On the other hand, if you like Sonic and old cartoons, you&#039;ll probably like Sonic SatAM (and probably think Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is hilarious/deplorable and that Sonic Underground shouldn&#039;t even exist). In other words, play the game or watch something else Sonic related. Like the straight-to-VHS movie, Sonic the Hedgehog. DEFINITELY WATCH THAT. Not this. This should be placed in the bowels of hell and forgotten about.

    When I was a kid, I love sonic x to death and praise the dub back when I was watching it every Saturday morning of the 4kids block . But as I got older and starting to use the internet, I come a across many people ranting about 4kids who are the one who dub sonic x. As I start to know more of what they do to anime they got, I realize how much of my childhood I wasted. Now that I got that out of the way, lets me say that sonic x is a decent anime but didn&#039;t reach its potential when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60089">
        it was announce. So here is my review of the show.<br />
<br />
Story:6/10<br />
 The plot starts as sonic and his friends attacks Dr.eggman&#039;s base to rescue Cream and cheese. Sonic face him head on but an accident occurs that suddenly sends sonic and his friends to a different place in time I guess since the anime did a bad job of explaining that part. Later he meets up with Chris who lets him stay. The others are found and they start to look for the emeralds before Eggman can. Now my first issue is this. It gets very confusing as what I said before, did not explain much of how they got sent back in time. This has been later explain in season 2 but I&#039;m still confuse!? Another problem is that it very cliche and I notice this a lot threw out the entire anime. This show had 3 seasons and to me the good ones are season 2 and 3 as season 2 follow mostly from the games with few changes and it works and season 3 having a decent plot arc. But in the U.S version you won&#039;t get the full story as their a lot of edits done in order to fit to children standards. I watch every episode dub and sub and I notice a lot of scenes cut  out and stuff they edit out in order to get a Y7 rating in america. Ya they pretty much rape it to death as far as everybody says. So for plot I give it a 6 for the japanese.  <br />
<br />
Art:7/10<br />
 The art is really decent for the most part. While not at the wow factor, it gets the job done. The bland background are really detailed and the character look well enough like their video game counter parts. The action scenes are really the best moment as the sense of speed looks so well. So art it did its job. <br />
<br />
Music:8/10<br />
 Now music is pretty decent. The opening is good but I like the ending songs the most. My favorite has to be ending 3 because I just freaking love those beats. And the background music did good to fits its scene but we don&#039;t get that in the in the U.S oh no we get very bland music 4kids made which is epic crap! The only piece of music I like is the opening and thats it! So music I give it a 8 in japanese while I give the 4kids a 1 and thats because of the opening. <br />
<br />
English dubs vs english subs:<br />
 4kids this has to be one of your worst dubs ever! Well not as bad as one piece but still its bad! Now the voices are actually pretty natural for the U.S but the main problem is the script! 4kids hired script writers who don&#039;t know what sonic is. This is fail fail fail as its so simple it just makes me sick! Now the japanese is a lot better with better voice acting and dialoge so watch it but please avoid the english dub at all cost!<br />
Winner: English subs <br />
<br />
Characters:6/10<br />
 The character are just like their video game counterparts. In the japanese, I praise it for trying to add more depth to the characters. I actually care more about them. You wont get that in the dub as they try to simplify it so kids can understand it. As for the new characters, they are hit or miss. Some I do like while others are pretty much useless like Chris who is just there to be friends with sonic and the anime mostly focus on him which really waste time. There is also Cosmo and she just there to be a love interest to tail with some few exceptions. So character I give a six.     <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:6/10<br />
 Well the japanese version is where I get the most enjoyment out of. The dub pretty much knock it all down with its edits and bad writing! While not great, it is what its worth a watch so I watch it if you have some time to waste but only subtitles. Parents don&#039;t let your kids watch this in dub because if you do, once they become anime fans, They&#039;ll realize they have wasted part of their childhood like I did.    <br />
<br />
Overall:6/10 Fair at best<br />
<br />

    It&#039;s the best because the characters and story are the greatest ever written. If you hate this show you are probably lying. The plot is simple yet is the most enjoyable thing I&#039;ve ever experienced. The conflicts feel very real and are not forced. This show is the pinnacle of entertainment and can never be topped. This show is easily the reason I am still alive to this day and continues to give me joy with each rewatch. Some people may be turned off by the fact that it&#039;s based on a video game, but trust me, this show will not disappoint you.

    Sonic X was a favorite of mine back in the day. When the show aired on Saturday mornings, courtesy of the CW4kids, the Sonic fan in me tuned in every Saturday to watch the adventures of Chris Thorndyke and his stranded alien, animal, anthropomorphic friends. What Sega hoped to do what this series was popularize the brand by conveying Sonic&#039;s video game adventures in a television format.<br />
<br />
Does it work? Sort of . . . It gets some things right but some things wrong.<br />
<br />
Story (7/10): Season 1 is a mostly episodic set-up that details the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (I mean, Sonic and Chris).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196231">
        The first episode details how Chaos Control (teleportation, a power granted by the Chaos Emeralds) mis-used by Eggman whisks Sonic and his friends away from their planet, Mobius, to the real world. There, Sonic and his friends take shelter at the home of a lonely, 12-year-old rich kid name Chris&#039;s mansion. In fear of what would happen if their identities were revealed, Chris tries to help Sonic and co. stay below the public eye (though these attempts ultimately prove futile). As you can tell by this premise, there are little to no overarching plot details, so I&#039;ll have to judge the episodic story lines by what merits do have. They&#039;re a blend of action and slice-of-life sitcom antics that worked okay for me at the time but thinking back on it now, come off as rather bland. The central reason behind this is how oddly slow-paced this show is.<br />
<br />
Most modern cartoon series know that kids tend to prefer a faster pace. It lends itself to more intense action, snappier comedy, and compelling events. These things help keep aforementioned target audience interested. Unfortunately, Sonic X doesn&#039;t really do this. Even as a kid, I recall yawning during most of these season 1 episodes because the writers spent way too much time on conversational scenes that have no weight. Because of the archetypal nature of these characters, conversations in the boring mansion backdrop aren&#039;t going to entertain, especially when they&#039;re sparse on humor. Oddly enough, the human characters are used for humor more often than Sonic&#039;s group, who seem to take their conflicts a bit too seriously. This results in an uneven tone that only kept me hooked because I cared about the Sonic characters.<br />
<br />
Season two picks things up a bit, adapting plots from Sonic Adventures 1 and 2, only using the human characters established in the series. Now, this was a bit more compelling. From Sonic and Shadow&#039;s duels, to the climatic battles between titanic foes, season 2 was action-packed and filled with thrills that entertained me at the time. There&#039;s a surprising bit of pathos behind the stories, and even the slower-paced conversational scenes worked better because it felt there was actually something to talk about. Sure, 12-year-old wish fulfillment was at play here, but it was still a LOT more enjoyable than season 1.<br />
<br />
Season three is . . . weird. This time around, Eggman&#039;s not even an antagonist, but an occasional ally. The foe this time around is a space-fearing race known as the Meterax who are in pursuit of an OC for reasons established during the plot. It&#039;s the series attempt at an overarching story, and it does a decent job. The Meterax are pretty bland as far as overlords go, but to its credit, the arc is fairly well-executed Ensemble darkhorses like Shadow and Rogue only get bit parts (unfortunately), but otherwise, it&#039;s a decently executed (if not terribly distinct) storyline.<br />
<br />
Art (5/10): Ugh. TMS does not bring their best here at all. Very little here is well-done. The colors are bland, the backgrounds are forgettable, and the animation is limited during conversations and cuts corners during fight scenes. This is egregious because a series like Sonic should be more fast-paced (pun totally intended), not a weird mix of camera pans, looped animation, and dragged frames. The human character designs are bland, with little to distinguish them from the anime grain.<br />
<br />
To its credit, though, the Sonic characters are rendered accurately. Sure, Snic has less quills than he normally does, but TMS brings their designs to traditional animation form about as accurately as one could do so. If only they moved a little more . . .<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10): Whether America&#039;s &quot;Gotta Go Fast&quot; or Japan&#039;s &quot;Sonic Drive&quot;, I remember Sonic X for its iconic themes. They were catchy, upbeat, and opening themes that really capture the tone of the video game series. The 4kids score, however, was pretty weak and didn&#039;t have any memorable tones. The anime&#039;s, however, was well-done and matched the on-screen action well.<br />
<br />
The future ending themes for Sonic X in Japan were strong as well. T.O.P was my personal favorite. Combined with cool on-screen visuals, it conveyed the smooth, cool side of Sonic exceptionally well.<br />
<br />
While the English dub of this series is well-cast, it&#039;s not terribly well-acted. Besides its script inconsistencies, the voice acting is stiff and awkward at times (it would take time for this cast to come into their own). Conversely, the Japanese voice isn&#039;t terribly well-cast, but its much better acted. I wouldn&#039;t blame most people if they watched the sub on Hulu because of this.<br />
<br />
Character (6/10): I mentioned earlier that Sonic and his friends are archetypal, but that doesn&#039;t mean they have to be boring. These video game characters have enough personality that they should be able to drive a series like this. Unfortunately, they don&#039;t get enough screen time and what little they do get is marred by underwhelming comedy, and poorly-executed build up to episodic conflicts. Sonic, in particular, feels like an enigmatic drifter who we only cut to when we need him. He&#039;s got his cocky, classical anti-hero style traits like he does in the video games, but they don&#039;t shine through here because the main character spot is taken by Chris Throndyke, an utterly forgettable progtagonist. Ash Ketchum and the lead from the Beyblade series look compelling compared to this guy&#039;s generic niceness, really looks up to Sonic as role model stuff. His one distinctive trait (his lonely rich kid side) doesn&#039;t get enough screen time or development to be interesting. To his credit, though, his emotion in some particularly tear-jerking scenes does ring true.<br />
<br />
The other human characters are pretty boring. The butler has his moments but isn&#039;t strong enough to be memorable, the scientist is bland in much the same Chris is, and the maid is a boring stereotype. Chris&#039;s uncle, Sam, is a weak Human Torch expy, and the President is about as memorable as an unnamed president would be. <br />
<br />
One of the only strong characters in the human cast is Topaz, an original character who is a member of GUN. Her vitriolic relationship with Rogue is well-executed, and she&#039;s played refreshing straight as a normal person swept into these events without her consent. A couple one-shot humans, like a traumatized GUN soldier in seasons 2, and Helen in season 3,  are also portrayed effectively and show more distinctiveness than their supporting/main character peers.<br />
<br />
As for Sonic&#039;s friends, they have their canon traits. Amy loves Sonic, yet is kinda violent to everyone else, Cream is the enthusiastic younger sister type character, Knuckles is, well, a knucklehead who is kinda slow at times, and Tails is the upbeat, ready to help sidekick. These personalities don&#039;t get a lot of limelight in season 1, but get some tests in seasons 2 and 3. These moments are refreshing, but they certainly don&#039;t take them out of one-note character. Dr. Eggman is admittedly entertaining, and he gets really cool a couple times late in the series but is mostly a bright spot because the rest of the cast is that bland. It&#039;s bit post-morteum to say this now, but his robot buddies, Decoe and Boccoe, are only good for a couple gags.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6/10): I LOVED this series when I was younger. For all its flaws, it was my favorite characters on the TV screen, battling evil, going through drama, and having fun together. Does it really stack up for me now?<br />
<br />
Honestly, there are so many other series that fill the quotient for this series better. It has a really yawn-inducing first season, and the next two seasons, while decently-executed, don&#039;t stand out much from its contemporaries. The main reason I&#039;ll remember this series is because of how nostalgic it was, and that despite its slow pace, I still tuned in every week I could. <br />
<br />
So, props for that.<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10): Don&#039;t watch this series if you&#039;re not a fan of the franchise, casual or otherwise. But, if you are, this series might be diverting. If you can make it past season 1, there are legitimately enjoyable plots, scenes, and character dramas. It&#039;s just not gonna appeal much to those who don&#039;t care about the franchise already.

    Utterly a masterpiece, I&#039;m an epic gamer so of course I understand the greatness of an epic gamer anime.<br />
<br />
The story was really empowering, watching as a cast of outsiders try to blend in and become accepting with the society they&#039;ve been thrusted into due to an unfortunate incident. They go from becoming outsiders to becoming heroes, and just thinking about it makes me shed a tear at how masterfully the story and structure was handled, I never felt like I wasted a single minute.<br />
<br />
The animation rivals that of the greatest shows, with a musical number that makes me cry with how wonderful the instrumentation and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335839">
        proper toning blends together to create the greatest soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the characters! The characters are also stunning, I never seen an anime with such a wide cast of characters, each and every character getting the screentime they deserve.<br />
<br />
I greated enjoyed this anime and would truly recommend it to my fellow gamers. Sonic X is a must watch piece of history, along with Kirby Right Back at Ya and Mew Mew Power.<br />
<br />
i like the 4kids dub and sometimes my mom watches it with me and i saw 13 episodes but i missed one because i woke up late. i dont know how to understand japanese

    This is by far the worst animated adaption in the whole entire Sonic series, this series really had not effort put into it whatsoever, probably due to Sonic not doing well in japan at all. But to me, that brings up the question, why does this thing exist in the first place?<br />
Story - 3/10<br />
In terms of the series plot, well... it does not really have a plot until later in the series, the first 26 episodes of this is just basicly Sonic and freinds going on an adventure to find the Chaos emeralds to get back hime after being transported to earth. After the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163191">
        26 episodes is the first time where the plot has any significance. To bad they were lazy and just took the plots from the two Sonic Adventure games and made a terrible adaption of it. Really, the only arc with some ounce of effort put it was the last one, Even that was not very orignal.<br />
Animation - 1/10<br />
Then there&#039;s the art, which is some of the worst I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Only a very small percentage of the shows 78 episodes have well drawn, on model animation. And I will admit, those few episodes looked fantastic. But then theres everything else. God. The Sonic Stadium fourms has a thread dedicated to the many different animation styles in the show. And trust me, there are many disgusting ones in there.<br />
Music - 7/10<br />
The music for the show is actually pretty good. The music that plays in the episodes fits it well enough, but I am more focusing on the shows opening and three ending themes, all of which are fantastic and well worth listening to.<br />
Characters - 2/10<br />
Then theres the characters, and I may as well talk about the shows true main character, Chris Thorndyke. I&#039;m serious, he is the only character in the show to get any backstory, or development... To bad he is a unlikable brat. Moving on, we have the &quot;main&quot; character, Sonic, who really only appears at the end of the episode to defeat the Eggmans schemes at the end of most episodes, most of the time he&#039;s just lying around doing nothing. No one in the rest of the cast is important at all to be honest, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, Cream, just for the most part stand in the background and watch Chris whine and Sonic do all the work. The only character in the show who&#039;s worth a damn is Dr. Eggman, and without him, this would be even more painful than the show already is, he is the only source of relief in the whole show, he&#039;s a funny and fun to watch. <br />
Overall - 1/10<br />
Don&#039;t watch this show. There is almost nothing in it that&#039;s worth watching it for. If you want to listen to the opening and endings, you can just listen to them on youtube. Stay away, it&#039;s not worth you&#039;re time. And if you just have to watch this trainwreck, avoid the 4kids dub like the plauge.

    Sonic X. what can i say about this show: This is one of the shows that are so bad that they&#039;re actually good. As a fan of Sonic, this show is less enjoyable than the games. the characters are bad, and the voice acting is not great. especially the English dub. The story is also nothing special the only thing i like about the show is its  English theme song which became a meme. Sonic X turns out to be a good anime but with bad parts if you want a great Sonic cartoon, there&#039;s the sonic the hedgehog cartoon from 1991 (Not AOSTH).

    A Disappointing Review of Sonic X<br />
<br />
Story/Characters (5/10): Lets talk about the characters first. Sonic, the blue, funny and fast hedgehog, is the main protagonist of this show. He is the hero, the knight in shining armor, the... okay lets just skip his intro. We all know who Sonic is so there&#039;s no need to explain his background. He appears in a lot of videogames and is the mascot character of Sega. In this show he is portrayed as a cool, cocky and fast character. He is headstrong and always runs before he thinks. His goal is to stop Dr. Eggman from obtaining the Chaos Emeralds.<br />
Dr.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195680">
        Eggman, Sonic&#039;s power hungry arch-enemy, is a mad scientist who wants all of the 7 Chaos Emeralds in order to gain absolute power (...for some reason).<br />
Supporting cast: essentially, anyone who is not Sonic or Dr. Eggman is a supporting cast member. Even the human protagonist, Christopher Thorndyke had been converted to being a simple damsel in distress. In fact most of the main cast was there just to help Sonic. Other than that they were pretty much useless.<br />
Honorable mention goes to Shadow and Rouge, who are by far the coolest characters with the best backstories aside from Sonic himself.<br />
<br />
The story seems very generic with the hero finding things in order to defeat the main villain. In Sonic X&#039;s case, he bursts into Dr. Eggman&#039;s base right when he was about to achieve absolute power. Sonic interferes with his plan which causes an explosion that transports everyone to Earth. After that, Sonic and his friends team up with Chris to collect all the Chaos Emeralds in order for them to get home and defeat Dr. Eggman.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation (6/10): The art/animation was watchable but nothing stood out as interesting.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music (6/10): Generic. Nothing stood out as interesting except for the theme song. I found that to be very catchy. <br />
<br />
Dub or Sub?: Sub. If you plan on watching this, go with the sub/Japanese version. They edited a lot of violent stuff out of the Japanese version when they created the American version. The American version was very kid friendly. The english dub voice acting was acceptable but the dialogue wasn&#039;t very good.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6/10): The show entertained me when I was young but now, I mainly see it as a waste of time. The only thing that was worthwhile was any interactions/battles that took place between Sonic and Dr. Eggman.<br />
<br />
Summary/Overall (6/10): Overall, this is a kid&#039;s show so all of the things that I listed above are not important. The story is generic. The characters are uninteresting (aside from the four I mentioned above). The art and sound aren&#039;t that impressive. And, the show does absolutely no justice to any of the Sonic videogames that I played as a child.<br />
<br />

    I have only watched up to episode 20, I will update later when needed. This review might also contain some spoilers which I apologize for.<br />
----------<br />
I will admit right here and right now that I dislike video games and find no use for them; as a result, I have never played any of the Sonic the Hedgehog video games. I have only started watching this anime was because my friends are addicted to Sonic, they have played all the games, watched all the series, and more. This anime is obviously recommended for younger viewers; however I do believe some people forget that. I believe the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57939">
        people who usually rate this anime a low rating of 1-4 usually compare it to the video games produced. The only thing I recommend is that people should start thinking to themselves that Sonic X is a Japanese animation made solely for the enjoyment of others, and is not a sequel or an adaption of its video games. <br />
<br />
The anime Sonic X explains the adventures of Sonic and his friends as they travel to the human world, and communicate with the people around them. I will admit that when I watched the first episode that it really gave quite a show, it didn’t make mistakes like the past Sonic animation adaption.  However, as the series goes on it gets quite repetitive with Dr. Egg man trying to rule over the world and defeat Sonic, but in the end Sonic always defeats his crazed inventions. Which takes me to another point; the crazed inventions manufactured by Dr. Egg man are in no doubt extremely different from your average robot. The robots produced by Dr. Egg man are usually robots that are used for different things like a teaching, sporting, and more. The robots are also strange looking robots with a multitude of colors on them which are great for younger viewers. Near the end of season 1, things finally start to get suspenseful and emotional which creates a perfect reaction where the viewers may start to tear up due to the overall greatness of what is happening. <br />
<br />
Characters shown in the anime are excellently showing character development, however one problem this anime makes is that Sonic himself does not get that much view time because he is usually running, in fact Sonic is mostly seen running when he is usually not defeating Dr. Egg man. Usually Chris is sucking most of the air time in the anime. The main human protagonist of Sonic X, is a young boy named Chris Thorndyke who is your average 12 year old rich boy. Chris’s mother is a well known movie star, his father an owner of a large company, his uncle a famous race car driver, and his grandpa a scientist. Chris is what I would to describe to be very different from average kids his own age, unlike your normal 12 year olds, Chris does not beg or cry or even bug his parents about anything, and he is what I call too mature. Chris being to mature for his age can create problems for younger audiences because they can’t really relate to him in anyway; consequently he is usually seen to people as an unneeded character to the anime. <br />
<br />
The drawing style of Sonic X is not something to die for; it is your usual mix of anime and Western cartoon. The characters are fairly well drawn, not the best, but it’s something that anyone can bare with. What bothers me the most when it comes to the art is that way animals are drawn, they need to look a little more realistic too me. The background drawings are usually well drawn with distinct features added into them. One thing I mostly enjoy about the anime is its use of colors, the colors are usually bold and bright which help show some mood in the anime.<br />
<br />
The Japanese music in the anime is what I enjoy the most. Opening 1 of Sonic X called “Sonic Drive” is very upbeat which I enjoy to listen too. The only problem is, is that there is only one opening for the anime which some people may fine boring to listen to after a while. The ending songs of the anime are very calm and peaceful which I like to listen too. The voice actors do an excellent job at portraying the character’s attitudes in the anime. The sound effects are also used perfectly in the correct situation which helps add the needed feel to the anime. <br />
<br />
What I enjoyed most about Sonic X is its hilarious moments in the anime. At time to time while watching Sonic X I would always end up laughing out loud which, as a result causes my parents to yell at me to shut up. However, when I don’t fine any of the moment’s funny, I would usually snuffle a yawn or a mere “eh.” During the fighting moments I would usually just get pretty bored with them because they happen in pretty much every episode, even in a mere baseball game its still considered fighting there. Overall I would rate my enjoyment level at a 7. I recommend this anime for people who enjoy the usual mix of Action and Comedy, however the anime does get repetitive which I understand can get greatly annoying. If you are a huge fan of the Sonic franchise, and you have played all its video games than I don&#039;t know if I could recommend it to you or not because some people may be angered for the fact that humans are involved in the anime, while some people may find it intriguing to see the Sonic characters interacting with humans. So it just greatly depends on what are your likes and dislikes. <br />

    Sonic X began as an ordinary Anime for kids in its first half.<br />
<br />
Simple created episodes where Sonic helps the people on earth and slowly becomes considered a hero in society.<br />
<br />
The characters were all pretty good and thoroughly introduced, which gave the viewer the certain feel of commitment.<br />
<br />
While the plot wasn&#039;t mainly focused in the first half, most episodes were entertaining and gave someone a better view on the whole Sonic Universe. All in all a comfy procedure. <br />
<br />
The comedy might not be for everyone, but it isn&#039;t bad.<br />
<br />
Then, when the second half began, a lot changed. The show was given a whole new setting and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277380">
        the plot was primarily focused. This made the whole Anime way more interesting and kept the viewer hooked, who was looking for more action, more storytelling and most importantly a certain meaning.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to say that the first half was bad or anything, it&#039;s just that the second was a lot more interesting and fun to watch. It is the reason why this show is considered to be good.<br />
<br />
The first half was pretty slow paced, while the second was the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
The ending of the show is something very significant. It is really sad. Not a happy ending, just the bland reality. But very good.<br />
<br />
It is very thrilling and touching.<br />
It is one of those ends you could call: &quot;fulfilling.&quot;<br />
I don&#039;t think anyone could have created an ending better.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t mind watching Anime that is targeted at kids I would really recommend you to watch it.<br />
<br />
And something to note, throughout the show many truths have been spilled. It teaches you to beware a healthy mind and do the right thing.<br />
You learn for your life while watching this. Something you can&#039;t say for every show.<br />
<br />
That means, yes. I would call this Anime good for the development of children&#039;s minds.<br />
<br />
If I had to vote for each half separate I&#039;d give the first a 3/5 and the second a 5/5, which gives a result of 8/10 in total. Storywise.<br />
<br />
Additional:<br />
OST was pretty neat, though I like the english opening more I wouldn&#039;t recommend watching it in English at all since it&#039;s heavily cut and the voices are straight up bad.<br />
<br />
The animations are alright, considering it&#039;s been drawn by different animators throughout the show. <br />
Nothing great but nothing bad either.<br />
<br />
The voices were good, compared to the English ones they appear even better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading my review.

    Don’t take this review seriously, this is like my second time reviewing something and let me tell you, I’m not good at this at all lmao. Anyhow let’s begin;<br />
I rewatched some episodes and it really took me back. The story isn’t perfect although having this as a childhood anime and rewatching it makes me feel like I have the mind of a child again to the point I just can’t hate it or call it “bad” yk? Especially since this one was one of my first anime’s.<br />
.<br />
Story is pretty okay it really isn’t the best but it’s not the worst either. I wish there was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351937">
        something more to it though, rewatching some eps makes it seem cliche but I’m not sure if this was considered “cliche” back in the day so maybe it isn’t? Anyhow, the story is kind of nice but I’m not sure how to describe it but I guess it’s not amazing? Furries from another planet suddenly crashed into earth.. yeah truly is intended for children but like I said, I can’t hate it. — 6/10<br />
.<br />
The art is pretty decent, there’s not much to judge about it, it pretty basic. 5/10 <br />
.<br />
I don’t really focus on the soundtracks but I remember when watching this as a kid, I used to get so pumped up when an action scene appeared and what made me more excited is the soundtrack that goes something like “DUN DUN DUNNDUN DUN DUNNN” or whatever so it’s pretty nice ig. 6/10<br />
.<br />
The characters are pretty charming ngl, I like their personalities but it’s just the character writing,, I wish there was more to it but it’s fine they’re cute. — 7/10<br />
.<br />
ENJOYMENT ok ok honestly when I rewatched some of the episodes, I feel like I enjoyed it as much as I did back then, probably because of the fact that it’s my childhood(?) idk but I really had fun watching it. Imperfect but still enjoyable. — 7/10<br />
.<br />
Overall, I think I’ll give this a 7 out of 10 because it has its ups and downs but it really is fun to watch. Do I recommend? Well it depends if you’re a child or not, I would really recommend this for children to watch since it’s really nice and is a great edition to your childhood, although I’m not sure if I would recommend for someone older to watch this but I guess you can give it a try? It’s not that bad and it’s pretty nice but ofc that’s just my opinion.<br />
.<br />
Thanks for reading lmao I’m sorry for wasting your time this be a horrible review and i have horrible grammar skills (english isn’t my first language) but still for whoever is reading this, thanks :)

    Okay, this is my first ever review on here, so this may really suck... But here we go.<br />
<br />
First let me say that I&#039;m not even going to bother with the 4Kids dub. The dub was so terrible that it&#039;s one of the biggest reasons why I regret ever watching this. I&#039;m going to focus on the original Japanese version as much as I can and just pretend that the 4Kids dub never existed. Everyone knows how much 4Kids ruins anime. But with that out of the way, let&#039;s get started with the actual review.<br />
<br />
This was one of the very first anime series I remember loving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74251">
        when I was a kid. I remember even rewatching some of the episodes over and over and constantly talking about it with my friends and always drawing the characters. But now that I&#039;ve grown up and matured a bit more, I think to myself: Was it really that good? Unfortunately, no, it wasn&#039;t as good as I remember it being. However, I didn&#039;t think it was TERRIBLE exactly. It&#039;s a typical anime based off of a video game. You can&#039;t expect it to be spectacular.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10.<br />
<br />
The story, if I can remember, is about Dr. Eggman collecting all seven of the Chaos Emeralds and also captures Cream the Rabbit, so Sonic comes to try and save Cream and take the Emeralds out of Eggman&#039;s hands. All this leads to an accident where a very large explosion occurs and Sonic and all his friends are then transported to Earth, not knowing how they can return to their home planet, Mobius. All seven of the Chaos Emeralds have been scattered around Earth and now Sonic and his friends must collect them all before Eggman does. <br />
<br />
The story itself wasn&#039;t horrible. It wasn&#039;t breathtaking and thrilling, but it wasn&#039;t horrible. It&#039;s really no worse than any other typical kid&#039;s anime plot. The characters are separated from their home planet, they do what they can do to help the planet that they&#039;ve landed on, and they eventually make their way home. Plus it&#039;s also got some cliche mech-like fighting with all the air force pilots and robots and the transformations for getting super powers, so again, it&#039;s like your typical cliche, anime plot. It&#039;s nothing too special. Pretty cheesy, but nothing horrible.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10.<br />
<br />
The art was actually pretty decent. The environments were very colorful and vivid and the lighting was average. They would sometimes overdo the lighting effects and make things too bright and I thought they overdid that a bit. However, the scenery itself, again, was very vivid and pretty. The city scenes were nothing special, but when they&#039;d focus more on Sonic&#039;s world, the scenery was just very enjoyable to look at. The character designs were decent as well. It had the same, unique style that Sonic has had for years. The characters just really stick out and I still enjoy their designs. Unlike your typical chibi cat with dot eyes and a 3-shaped mouth, they just have their own, unique style which to me seemed like an American cartoon style mixed with the anime style, and that again, is what I thought was so unique about the style. So the art was, in my honest opinion, very well done, but they could have used less light effects.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10.<br />
<br />
To be honest, a lot of the tracks sounded the same to me... Then again, I usually don&#039;t pay too much attention to the soundtracks in anime. They all had a good, jumpy, actiony feel to them while others had just a sort of &quot;sit back and relax&quot; feel... If that made any sense. The opening theme, in my opinion, was pretty terrible. I liked how the clips were all put together, but the song was just kind of awful. Again, just my opinion. However, the ending theme for the last season was very charming to me. It was a sweet, little love song and just in general had a cute scene going on. I enjoyed some tracks in this anime, but most of them just sounded the same to me.<br />
<br />
Character: 5/10. They were quirky enough. A lot of the characters just had a pretty sarcastic personality. Some were hostile and impatient, others were sweet and social. Most of the human characters were pretty irritating and were generally useless and so were a few of the animal characters. Some of the characters were pretty much just there to get in the way and others just showed up for some filler episodes, so the characters weren&#039;t really that special. They had some silly dialog here and there, but they weren&#039;t anything that made my jaw drop in awe. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t horrible, but it isn&#039;t the sort of thing that I&#039;d sit down and watch again. It had it&#039;s silly, quirky moments, but nothing that would make me go &quot;Hey, let&#039;s go watch some Sonic X! YEAH!!&quot;. That&#039;s probably one of the last things I&#039;d say.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the fighting scenes and some of the silly, arguing scenes. The art, again, was nice to look at and the story wasn&#039;t horrible. I thought it was more cliche than anything. The soundtrack was okay and the characters were fine. Personally, I thought a lot of the episodes were just boring, filler episodes, but they didn&#039;t make me wanna throw up. They just weren&#039;t that entertaining. So again, the anime is rather cliche and just had a lot of filler episodes, but it wasn&#039;t outrageously horrible. Not something I&#039;d sit down and watch again, but still not as horrible as people say it is. Just avoid watching the 4Kids dub and it should be an okay anime.

    Sonic X is based on the two  games for dreamcast and Gamecube at least for the first part of the anime. Then end up going to space towards the end. The Story really boring. If You aren&#039;t a hard core sonic fan you won&#039;t enjoy this anime. However this anime is not complex at all so even your average joe can enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Art: The art work is decent you can still have some amusement by looking at the characters. The art work on tails and amy are great they have really improved.<br />
<br />
Sound: I can say the anime does have good english dub the jp

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70309">
        dub everyone sounds like women the opening to the jp version of the anime alot better.<br />
<br />
characters: the personalitys are pretty dull compare to the sonic 1993 series<br />
every character seems like a girl, there emo and  when they  try to be funny it <br />
it&#039;s either funny or fail.

    Sonic X is an anime that&#039;s based off of Sonic Adventure, originally released for the Sega Dreamcast. The anime is about Sonic and friends trying to stop Doctor Ivo Robotnik (Or just simply Eggman). While fighting him, Chaos Control happens, sending Sonic &amp; Co. from the planet of Mobius to Earth. While running across Station Square, Sonic lands in a pool, and a young boy named Christopher Thorndyke goes to rescue him. <br />
As the plot goes on, Sonic meets some of his friends, such as Cream the Rabbit and Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, also meeting a long-time rival, Knuckles the Echidna. It&#039;s from there that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131841">
        Adventure Arc. starts up and characters from Sonic Adventure show up. If you&#039;ve played Sonic Adventure, you already know the plot, but otherwise, you&#039;ll enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Art style:<br />
For me, I loved all the visuals from this show. Everything looked amazing and the visuals for the anime were down-right stunning. The characters in it are similar to their regular video game models, but with more detail than their Dreamcast models. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
The voice acting can be either good or bad for some people. In the English Dub, I loved Mike Pollock as Dr. Eggman, he plays the role perfectly and is the current voice actor to this day. Jason Griffith and others also do a fairly good job on their characters, aside from a certain future character. Sonic&#039;s Japanese Voice Actor also does a good job as Sonic, but I will admit that I haven&#039;t seen much of the Japanese version. For the most part, these voices fit their characters.<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
Sonic has his personality like he does in current games: Cocky, cheesy, cool, but can be serious when the time comes. Christopher Thorndyke is annoying a lot of the time, but gets a lot better in Season 3. I&#039;ll only talk about three more, and these three are Team Chaotix. Vector is a clumsy goof who has it in for Cream&#039;s mother, Vanilla. *Ba dum tss.* Espio is a ninja, so he&#039;s much more calm and cool than the other two. Charmy is what a Six-Year-Old should be: Hyperactive, full of energy, moving around a lot, and talking a lot. I love all three of these characters, especially Vector. Sonic can be dumb at times, but Sonic always has been like this. Tails is the smart one, but admires Sonic like an older brother. Knuckles is very, very stupid. Amy is your typical fangirl, obsessing over Sonic. Eggman&#039;s robot assistants, Decoe and Bocoe are your Scratch and Grounder of this show. They can be dumb. Bokkun is like a child, whining over simple things. I won&#039;t talk about every character, cause I&#039;d spoil some of the future characters, but they&#039;re similar to their video game counterparts. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
Growing up with Sonic the Hedgehog, I can say that this show was great. If you&#039;re watching the English dub, even with all the edits compared to the Japanese version, you&#039;ll enjoy at least some of the roles, especially Mike Pollock as Dr. Eggman. That&#039;s easily one of the best roles in the show. If you liked Sonic Adventure and Sonic Battle, you&#039;ll enjoy it a lot!<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
I love the art-style of all these characters. I love most of these characters. I love the story. I love most of the voice acting. I like the soundtrack to this show. Either way, yes, I do recommend this show. If you like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, and Sonic Battle, you&#039;re going to, at the very least, love Seasons 1 and 2. This anime gets an 8/10. It was a great show, and if you&#039;re a fan of the blue blur like myself, you&#039;re going to love this show.

    Ever since I was a young kid I enjoyed playing Sonic The hedgehog games. They were not only fun, but something that simply drew me in was the link you&#039;d create with some of the characters. Sonic X is not exactly that kind of anime. For hardcore fans of the series like myself, it is without any doubts something you have to watch, but if you aren&#039;t, then you might be disappointed.<br />
<br />
The plot of the story, or should I say storieS since Sonic X is splitted in 3 segments, each covering different arcs. The first arc was a bit painful, a slice-of-life style that just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200524">
        didn&#039;t feel right. The second and third arcs were really enjoyable for me though. The references to Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle were well placed. The games obviously did it better, but it is still nice to see such spinoff.<br />
<br />
The ending, or the 3rd arc, is what the first should&#039;ve been. They picked up an actual story they&#039;ve and made it progress through the last few episodes. It was... weird, yet fun to watch. This anime is definitively not the best spinoff that could have been made, but I would recommend it to any hardcore fans of the Sonic saga.

    I grew up loving Sonic the Hedgehog shows and my favorite was Sonic the Hedgehog and friends with Sally Acorn and the gang. This is not that show. This turned into a sad little piece that 4 kids decided to dumb down and destroy. I wish this was redubbed like they did for One Piece where it was redubbed with better voices and actually whole, not cut up into strange looking segments. <br />
<br />
Now the story line is kind of well done, in the idea that it is pretty consistent though it became full of fillers and monster a day type of story. The characters personalities

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63879">
        seem to have changed from when I was younger and most of the other characters, I don’t remember being in any other show and so sadly, I have no base to them. Knuckles sounds more like a jackass and Tails seems a bit more of a wimp. Tails feels like hes almost a Mary Sue character. Almost anything bad that happens, he seems to have a gaget that will get them out of the pinch. For instance, in the third episode (American Dub) When Tails’ prapellers break, he just presses a couple buttons and he turns it into a jet plane. I guess Sonic would be considered a Mary Sue character as well in a sence. Not as bad as Tails but still bad in that he is pretty much gets out of a jam when he needs to. <br />
<br />
I do have to say that I really hate Amy. Not only is her voice bad but her personality is just a bitch. She is so infatuated with Sonic that she pretty much only becomes a bad ass if someone is badmouthing Sonic and when they aren’t (and even when they are sometimes) she really can’t do much. Where does she keep pulling the hammer out of anyway? At least the others seem to have a viable looking weapon that you can understand them using. The only real personality that stayed the same was Sonic and Eggman, even if they changed Eggman’s name. <br />
<br />
Another little name thing is that the Grandpa’s name is Chuck, just like the Uncle in Sonic the Hedgehog Satam. <br />
<br />
I do have a question though; I don’t remember Sonic having trouble swimming. Has it just been really long since I have seen it or am I right in saying he didn’t have that much problem before? I also don’t really remember him going super saiyan as well. And how does Tails transform his pain into a bunch of different forms? Why wouldn’t he just have the jet one on its own?<br />
<br />
Now, 4 kids have destroyed this whole show. I wouldn’t touch the dub they created because it’s just really stupid. They cut out a ton of scenes and did a photoshop to a lot of parts they did leave in. It was ok for those that didn’t know better, but if you have to do this edit, DON’T LICENSE IT!<br />
<br />
The artwork is rather well done, as crisp as you could probably get when trying to imitate an old art style from America. At least, that’s what it feels like. It was designed with children in mind so the characters mostly look like chibi creatures and the style feels interesting. <br />
<br />
The music is alright, and is pretty much is similar to the video games. The voices, surprisingly, might be the best that 4 kids used and that’s saying a lot. I do like the snarky voice of Sonic, and its better then what has happened sometimes but most of the others are rather bad. Amy’s voice is really really terrible and Cream’s voice is odd and squeaky. <br />
