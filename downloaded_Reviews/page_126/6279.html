    Over the last couple of years we&#039;ve seen a steady stream of light novels being adapted to anime series and now we get yet another with this series, produced by C-Station a former offshoot of Bee Train Production Inc. and the overall result is a marginal failure.<br />
<br />
Anime is full of time honored clichés that never seem to die and Dragonar Academy is so packed full of them it shows just how void this show is of any creativity or imagination. Giant bouncing breasts on all women characters, naked magic girls showing up from nowhere and mood swinging tsundere characters are ripe and abound in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152905">
        series; it feels less like this is less of a story of it&#039;s own and more of a copy paste job from a few dozen other series of it&#039;s kind.<br />
<br />
Taking from probably equally lazy source material, the scripts written by Noboru Kimura are shoddy and thrown together with no thought or effort behind them.  The large cast of cookie cutter characters will bore you with just how uninspired they are.<br />
<br />
This kind of tripe is barely forgivable from a group of first time creators but the fact this comes from several long time animators who had once made excellent shows in the past with their old studio, before breaking away to form this new company, adds more insult to injury.<br />
<br />
Topping off the cliche storm is a number of soft-core moments between a nude dragon lady giving oral to a pseudo tentacle rape scene, you would think they&#039;d rather be making a hentai series.<br />
<br />
Animation and art is just as awful with ugly looking dragons to top off the grossly exaggerated character designs. One would think with a show centered all around dragons it would be the one thing you could get right but the dragons look like a mix of generic fantasy dragons painted in pastels that makes them look like they&#039;re covered in hard water spots or they&#039;re wearing the projection clothes from the Count of Monte Cristo anime.   <br />
<br />
Interestingly, half the time you won&#039;t see any dragons and it will be mostly focused on whatever lame slice-of-life scenarios ripped from every other show of it&#039;s kind.  Echo while being presented as a dragon is little more than a magical loli with some horns glued onto her head.<br />
<br />
The musical score was somewhat interesting and entertaining and might be the one redeemable factor but it&#039;s tie to this awful show doesn&#039;t make me enthusiastic to  to listen to it.  The theme songs are typical for a show like this, shoehorning in as many voice actors, who may or may not have any musical talent, as you can to sing an ear shrieking J-pop song to sell some more CDs,  <br />
<br />
Dragonar Academy is uninspired, lazy and contrived. Beating down dead clichés that have saturated the market of the last couple years alone this would barely make the grade for a crappy one episode OVA, forget a 12 episode season.  I get the feeling even if you are looking for a silly fanservice show there are likely far more entertaining options out there that are less copy-and-paste than this show.<br />

    After watching the first episode, I thought that this had a lot of potential to be a good series but unfortuantly it lost it&#039;s potential as the episodes went by. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
At first the story interested me, it felt quite unique in a way and parts of the story reminded me of Soul Eater at times ( for some reason ) but after a few episodes in; it seemed to abandon its interesting plot and instead turn it into more of a regular harem/ecchi anime. I actually do enjoy harems to a degree but when you have an actual story first and then abandon it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152491">
        1/3 of the way through, it can make you feel disapointed because of its wasted potential.<br />
 That being said, the pacing felt fine and didn&#039;t feel slow or rushed barely at all. <br />
<br />
Art: <br />
I did enjoy the art, it had some interesting designs and the girl characters were cute. Although, the actual dragons in the show could have had something more in their designs but they&#039;re not at all completely bad. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
In my opinion, one of the best things in the entire show was the opening and ending themes. The opening was really good and showed some really cool scenes. The ending was cute and had a fun song which was a nice reward after going through each episode. The voice actors/actresses did a good job throught the show ( you know they wanted the villian to be mysterious and cool when they cast Dio Brando&#039;s voice actor )<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
Now this is where everything goes wrong. I thought most of the characters were paper-thin with nothing really going on with them. Some of the characters got character development while most just had no layers even if you thought they did. I also thought the villian was just bad and i wish we had gotten more depth to the character but unfortuantly we didn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
Here&#039;s the weird part; i actually really enjoyed it. I got the same enjoyment as I would watching any harem. Even though I had so much problems with it, i actually looked foward to watching more. If you enjoy harem/ecchi shows i think you would actually enjoy this even though it has many flaws. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
With the potential I thought it had at the beginning being destroyed as time went on, after watching the whole thing I feel disappointed. However like I said, if you enjoy harems and ecchi anime then by all means watch this one. But I don&#039;t think that this will be a very rememberable one with its very plain characters and interesting story it mostly abandoned. Seikoku no Dragonar turned out as a mediocre harem.

    Story<br />
The story was since episode 1 really interesting, i liked the idea that Ash Blake the MC could ride any Dragon he wanted because of what happened to him in his childhood by saving a girl that he doesn&#039;t remember in the present, you will predict since the begining who she is, well he is about to die by a girl he saved again and that&#039;s when his dragon Eco appears and not just a dragon a humanoid dragon. I would have rated higher but they left little questions that were important for the viewer to understand more the story.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound<br />
Both were very good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195076">
        because i really liked the music on the battle scenes, the voice acting was very good could have been great though and the ED song for some reason i liked it but that is my opinion you may not like the ED song, the art was very good i liked the dragons art style and even more with the bigger ones, bewbs are there too but you won&#039;t mind it like me.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
This is why i didn&#039;t rated higher, because i didn&#039;t got to know the backround of the character, they never remembered they met when they were kids, both Ash &amp; Silvia, despite that, the characters were interesting because you want to know more about the majority of them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I really enjoyed this anime, i wanted to see more, i wanted a 2nd season because of the questions at the end and to know the characters even more than what is shown here.

    So, this is my first official review, and I hope to write many more after this one.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
The story is a generic harem/fantasy story, filled with &quot;Plot&quot; and some battles. I liked the story and its concept, though halfway through the show, it became a bit too predictable. Though I really enjoyed certain parts, I also found myself wanting to fast forward others.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound: 7<br />
<br />
I grouped these two together because I felt like they complimented each other in this anime. The art was pretty good and consistent throughout the show, which is important. No particular sound stood out for me, but I did feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181412">
        like the bgm (background music) in the battle scenes intensified the character&#039;s moves and passion.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
<br />
The characters were good. Nothing more, nothing less. There weren&#039;t any exceptional or very outstanding and original traits between them, but they were good. The show had the usual harem girls, for example: a busty one, a rich one, a loli, a tsundere, and an erotic teacher etc. There were a few more, but that was the gist of it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall: 7<br />
<br />
I did enjoy the show quite a bit, but it didn&#039;t really strike me as exceptional, partly because I have watched hundreds of similar anime and so I&#039;ve kind of gotten used to all the recurring things in harem anime. The characters were alright, but neither them nor the story were able to pique my interest past the point of amusement.

    Seikoku no Dragonar... If there&#039;s something like a huge basketball ring in front of you, larger than the usual and there&#039;s a normal basketball ball in your front. You can&#039;t definitely miss from close range, can you? That&#039;s how I can picture a perfect analogy to the premise of Seikoku no Dragonar. But in this case, we are left wondering how Seikoku no Dragonar missed a blatant open chance for winning its potential.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************<br />
Story...<br />
<br />
I gave it a 6, honestly. Sometimes, even the most generic story can achieve better heights if given a thoroughly direction. But yet again, ruing their chances is this particular series. The story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178984">
        itself is solid. With a fantasy setting, the variable factors that can be used were supposed to be almost unlimited. But why? Why did Seikoku no Dragonar limited themselves to such product?<br />
<br />
Blaming the storyboards and the director must be a vain thing to do. Why? Because from what I saw, the director had very good series to his helm, so the last definite thing that could&#039;ve dragged Dragonar to the bottom must be, yeah, the reference material.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************<br />
Art...<br />
<br />
A beautiful realm was presented, with fictional beauty that is out of this world. I can easily point this out as a standout in terms of the drawings. Whether it be character designs or the setting world, it was consistently beautiful. There&#039;s nothing to doubt that the art department definitely wins a deserving 10, isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************<br />
Sound...<br />
<br />
6, I guess... Something inside me just made me skipped the OP and ED successively whilst watching in marathon since I didn&#039;t enjoyed the theme songs. The BGM(s) were also quite bland in my opinion. So a 6 makes perfect sense...<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************<br />
Character(s)...<br />
<br />
This is where they got nastily messy. I am no reader of the reference, but if the anime makers had been thoroughly confused on the characters, then I can find the salvation to pardon them.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters were so... plainly bland boring... No one is even interesting at the slightest. Eco, the generic loli and Silvia, the voluptuous princess as tsunderes failed to materialize the true charm of their characters. Neither the supporting casts, including the smexy maids or the student extras in the background had even made a scene worth praising. All is played by the point of &quot;seduce the men&quot; and &quot;show your booty and tits for fanservice&#039;s sake&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, focal character, Ash Blake. Is he decent? Maybe, to some, I guess. I suppose I&#039;ve outgrown his types, but frankly, he did a fair job as MC. Started out simply as an outcast then gaining new powers, he played the MC well. But in the end, he is not interesting. That&#039;s the point in appreciating the MC, right? Whether he/she is interesting, it all comes down to this focal issue. And this is where Dragonar failed miserably. The ability to make the MC interesting, is the least they should&#039;ve done keenly.<br />
<br />
We go to their adversaries faction. Do anybody stroke as interesting? The answer yet again, is a big &quot;no.&quot; There&#039;s really little point in delving too much on the characters since Dragonar had utterly failed on this aspect.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************<br />
Enjoyment and Overall...<br />
<br />
Nothing except for a 3. Was it too harsh? No, I guess not. Enjoyment was scarce but I&#039;ll tell you, even most of the fanservice scenes didn&#039;t inject a life to my watching interest. I guess all my laughs whilst watching is part where I am in absolute confusion as to why I even thought of watching a series that I already foresaw would be bland and boring. My thoughts were in jumble whether to drop it by episode 06, but I won&#039;t lie. I am a die-hard fanatic of Koyasu Takehito and even his most utter craps is something I&#039;ve watched.<br />
<br />
So concluding. Dragonar might be a winner in terms of sales. But in terms of worthiness(money and time watching), it&#039;s not. It&#039;s like paying a gold bar in exchange for a single bad-tasting moldy bread, leaving you feeling ripped afterwards the entire running time. <br />
<br />
But like I said, Dragonar is directly oriented to booty-and-tits- lovers. But in my head, I think I&#039;ll just go settle for a bonafide H material instead of watching borderline tentacles ripping panties and groping tits.

    This is one of those animes that had great potential, but falls short thanks to a combination of clichés, poorly developed characters, uninteresting story, excessive fanservice, etc.<br />
<br />
Its a shame, but the most enjoyable part of this serie would have to be the very begining of the ending song, aside from that, I didnt really got to enjoy anything else. I even feel I was too generous with my rating.<br />
<br />
I would only recommend this anime if you are very bored and want a lot of random fanservice (tentacles included), because I doubt you will watch it for either the characters or story, but that is up

    All I have to say is... wow. Simply, wow. <br />
<br />
The show had much potential, but halfway through the series, the directors realized that not everything from the LN could fit within a 12 episode series. <br />
<br />
Too bad. <br />
<br />
Initially, the story was great. A male lead with a hidden power, a cute heroine, a equally as cute &quot;main chick&quot; for the lead... and all set within the school setting. It had great potential. Unfortunately, with the introduction of flat characters and a story filled with plot holes, the quintessential (to me at least) anime quickly fell apart. <br />
<br />
I swear man, the ending did not leave me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172167">
        satisfied. Did Sylvia actually find out it was.... hmm. I seem to have forgotten the MC&#039;s name. That&#039;s funny, since I just finished watching the series 30 mins ago. <br />
<br />
Or the other really infuriating plot hole of Anya&#039;s sister not recognizing her. Seriously? She&#039;s the only other dark female in the entire world! She was right in front of you! Dammit!<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing OK with the series was the art, and even then, the quality of the breasts were of lesser quality than even some of the worst hentais!! <br />
<br />

Geez...

    In an amazing world filled with magic, we are introduced to the world of the great Dragons. Dragons as far as the eye can see, and tsundre lollis, wait i thought this was Seikoku no Dragonar and not Toradora? <br />
<br />
Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is a brief review of what to expect from another mediocre anime that doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with an overview: <br />
<br />
We are following our main male protagonist, a young sixteen year old boy Ash Blake. Ash Blake is your typical young male with a problem, he is the only one in his school who has yet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168993">
        to acquire a dragon of any form. While his comrades all have majestically grown dragons. This proves to be quite a problem as he gets teased and bullied over his yet-to-exist dragonkin, and hence he get&#039;s the name of &quot;Problem Child&quot;, because who wouldn&#039;t get mad and beat up people for not having a dragon? Yet as not having his own dragon, he has an ability; to ride any dragon he wants, and be perfect at it.(OVERPOWERED MAIN CHARACTER INCOMING?). <br />
<br />
A new year has started and the first class lessons is dragon fight, Ash has to borrow a friends Dragon and accidentally pushes into a female and her dragon, the beautiful female princess Silvia Lautreamont. In a heated discussion with &quot;shots being fired&quot; at each other, they agree to settle their difference in an upcoming festival&#039;s race. Some time in the race the dragon of Ash&#039;s friend gets exhausted in a forest, Ash suddenly feels a uncomfortable feeling and decides to check it out. After a short walk he finds a mysterious man with a phantom of the opera mask on his face. The man is our main villain and is nothing out of the ordinary. The man tells his underling to fight the young boy after analyzing his potential as a dragon-master. The battle is short and the underling get&#039;s thrown off a cliff. Ash&#039;s hero senses start to tingle and he knows he have to save her, by the time he manages somehow to grab her arm, the sides have changed. The young girl switches sides with our young protagonist and Ash is falling to his doom. But not for long!! A mysterious glow on his arm appears, and Ash knows, this is his dragon appearing before him. And who would have thought, that his dragon is a super overpowered machine of lollies thrown to the story for no reason, except to imitate Toradoras - Asaika Taiga. Yes, i said it.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Huff, where to begin? This anime has major problems with where it wants to go. Fantasy, ecchi, tsundre? WHERE? Let me spit it right out, the anime&#039;s characters are bland and bring nor nothing new, nor anything worthwhile watching. Main Characters are basically copies of the main characters of Toradora.....Ash Blake is a normal guy, with surreal powers that he gets for no good reason really, except for meeting a overpowered dragon empress inside a forest when he was small(what animes has this happened in before? oh like 10 of em). He is your &quot;I am a badass&quot; and &quot;I Try to be cool and kind hearted&quot; type of character which brings no flavor to the anime, and get&#039;s boring to watch. The Tsundre, is tsundre, just like any &quot;original anime&quot; we get introduced to a little girl who falls in love with his master, but can&#039;t really tell him that, so she pushes him around calling herself his master. The other characters have no story or at least one good enough to enjoy the series, as the most of them are just big boobed bimboes with dragons.<br />
<br />
Animations and Sound:<br />
<br />
This is where we the anime exceeds imo, the art is fantastic. The dragons, armors and the characters themselves are well designed, but still have something missing to them, which i to date can&#039;t really put my finger on. And the great arts spring is even better looking with the awesome classical type soundtrack which you normally would find in any good fantasy series. I could easily download the tracks and enjoy them for many hours, so on that front there are really no problems!<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
This anime leaves much to be desired.  it has a good animation design and soundtrack that has little flaws, countered by a failed attempt on genre&#039;s that in my opinion does not go well. It starts of as a pretty typical and not that bad of a fantasy anime, but it develops into this monstrous tentacle hentai wannabee.(Yes there are a lot of tentacles action that fondle them triple D&#039;sized cups that all girls in this anime have). <br />
<br />
I guess i was thrown of the chair, not that I don&#039;t enjoy some fan service, I just found it unappealing in what could have been a not so bad anime. The characters are straight bland, and the series tries to much to be like Toradora and Zero no Tsukaima(which are FANTASTIC), and pretty much leaves you hanging and loathing for more. Maybe a rich backstory and less fan service, could have been the justice this fantasy anime needed. <br />
All in all, I give this anime a 4/10. With a disappointing and almost non existent plot, the art and sound was top notch, but not enough to carry a whole bunch of pathetic characters to a form for any glory.  <br />
<br />
This is my first review, and hope you guys enjoyed it. All form for criticism is welcomed with a good embrace. <br />

    Story: The plot is almost a copy of the light novel series, so adaptation-wise, they followed the script. However this story seems better told in words than animation, given its almost cliche cut-and-paste nature. It&#039;s the standard &quot;magic knight saves princess&quot; story with an ecchi direction. Possibly enjoyable for those looking for this kind of genre  but unimpressive. <br />
<br />
Art: The art style was somewhat simple with the shading almost exclusively reserved for blushes and cleavage. It was easy on the eyes but lackluster. <br />
<br />
Sound: 12 episode harem fantasy  doesn&#039;t have dramatic soundtrack, so the main focus is OP/ED. I found Sakakibara Yui&#039;s OP

          <span style="display: none;" id="review157189">
        catchy but her distinctive style of singing isn&#039;t for everyone. The ED was cute but it seemed more appropriate for a purely slice-of-life show. Looking at the soundtrack as a whole, it delivered for the type of magic harem shenanigans the show was aiming for. It wasn&#039;t superb but appropriate. <br />
<br />
Character: Standard tropes. The characters were not creative, even regarding character design. It&#039;s sometimes enjoyable seeing a cliche like a loli tsundere but there were too many cliches  in this show. There&#039;s a static nature to the characters I didn&#039;t find enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: If loli tentacle harem was the show you were expecting, it hit the mark. For everyone else, the ecchi was excessive and the show weak. It was somewhat fun seeing cliche after cliche but it got old quick. <br />
<br />
Overall: A show I wouldn&#039;t personally recommend to many. The amount of effort put into the adaptation is mediocre but acceptable. Not the worst but almost niche due to its multiple cringe tentacle molestation scenes. <br />

    Seikoku no Dragonar truly is one of the worst things I have watched. It is an awful series and I would not recommend it to anyone. Despite having potential the creators disappointed me gravely. I watched the entire series thinking at the end of each episode that it cannot get any worse. I was mistaken. <br />
<br />
Story : 3<br />
<br />
As I said before the series had potential primarily due to the general story idea. Regrettably the end result was horrible. The story, in several cases, made absolutely no sense. Dozens of plot holes and the poorly written backgrounds for the main and supporting characters made a bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148541">
        story line into something utterly pathetic. <br />
<br />
Art :4<br />
<br />
Art may well have been the only decent thing about this series and when I say decent I do not mean that it was neither innovating or unique. It is more like what you would expect from this type of anime. The art in several cases seemed rushed and uncreative since no effort seemed to have been made to give that extra spark or glamour. Plus I did not enjoy the strong influence from hentais.<br />
<br />
Sound : 2<br />
<br />
Everything in relation to sound was completely subpar. The soundtrack was at best mediocre. Nothing really stuck with you except an annoying ending theme. The opening was not much better. As for voice acting I have to admit that once again they made no effort to create something unique. All characters were poorly voiced to the degree that almost all characters reminded you characters from other anime. It seems to me that no attempt was made to make them &#039;unique&#039;.<br />
<br />
Character : 1<br />
<br />
As I said before the characters were poorly written, portrayed and voiced. Nothing good can be said about them. No information was provided during the series about them, none that made any sense at least. Even when an attempt was made to introduce some piece of information about the characters background it was swiftly demolished by some random event that had no place being there or irrelevant interruption from another character thus creating the illusion of a cliffhanger. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall: 3<br />
<br />
In essence this a horrible series that I would not recommend. Nothing in it can be viewed as good or average. The creators failed miserably and this failure could only be explained if this was their first attempt in anime creation. Furthermore I blame the stations that decided this was a good anime to air and further pollute the anime world. In my humble opinion nobody should have to suffer viewing this series unless you feel you need to punish yourselves.<br />

    Seikoku no Dragonar is an average anime with an average plot, average characters and one of &#039;those&#039; endings. I don&#039;t mind ecchi shows in general but the premise was interesting so I was hoping that this one would maintain a better balance between having a plot and finding excuses to show everyone&#039;s boobs.<br />
<br />
Positives<br />
- The OST is quite nice.<br />
- The opening is quite nice.<br />
- Eco is cute.<br />
- Character interactions are quite funny most of the time.<br />
<br />
Negatives<br />
- As the show went on the art choice for how characters hair and eyes interact really got on my nerves.<br />
- 100% needless inclusion of tentacle enemies and dedicating lots of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148241">
        time to scenes with tentacles whenever they show up. (bleh)<br />
- It was like half way through the show before they realised they didn&#039;t have enough time to wrap it up so they rushed it.<br />
- Absolutely pointless side characters.<br />
- That damn tease ending.<br />
<br />
Overall not something you should go out of your way to watch but I don&#039;t regret giving it a go.

    Dragons? I&#039;m ready!<br />
It starts off with introducing characters, you learn that poor Ash doesn&#039;t have a dragon, but has a different sort of ability, and people make fun of him for it.<br />
<br />
By the end of episode 1, Ash gets his... dragon? <br />
If dragons had long pink hair and took the form of young girls, sure. <br />
Eco is adorable, but she&#039;s a bit bossy. The little girl brat type. She&#039;s a little hard to like at first, she starts to grow on you.<br />
<br />
Some of the Ecchi feels misplaced. Like it&#039;s just for the sake of it, which yes, a lot of it is, but there&#039;s also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232978">
        Ecchi done well. Some of this is kind of in the middle. <br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t just focused on Ash and Eco, you learn about Silvia and Rebecca too. Their pasts, their dragons. Plus other characters get parts too. It&#039;s a wide variety. <br />
<br />
Halfway through I was enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. It&#039;s definitely worth checking out.

    Beautiful girls and dragons. With a ton of fanservice.<br />
<br />
Seikoku no Dragonar is definitely your typical harem. The entire series based around the hero, who has multiple girls fall in love with him. The difference is, this series throws dragons into the mix.<br />
<br />
Brief summary: Learning to ride and tame dragons comes easy to most students at Ansarivan Dragonar Academy  except for first-year student Ash Blake. Ash is the laughing stock at school because, despite his unfashionably large star-shaped brand that marks him as a future dragon master, he has nothing to show for it. His dragon has never appeared. One fateful day, Ash&#039;s dragon awakes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148101">
        in full glory, but appears different than any dragon ever seen before,  in the form of a beautiful girl, Eco! What&#039;s worse, Ash soon discovers that this new dragon has attitude to spare, as she promptly informs him that she is the master, and he, the servant. Ash&#039;s problems with dragon riding have only just begun. But as the series progresses, Eco begins to develop feelings for Ash, and their relationship soon begins to take on a new shape.<br />
<br />
The story is definitely not the most unique plot that I have ever watched and is highly predictable.The MC helps girl, the girl falls in love, and the cycle is repeated as is true with most harems. It has a ton of action, and does transition very smoothly. It was not confusing in the slightest bit. The best aspect of the story however are the dragons. It&#039;s very interesting and intriguing to see the relationship the dragons and humans have, and to see them work together to accomplish goals. The story is indeed a fun ride though if you don&#039;t nitpick at every little detail. <br />
<br />
The art and sound of the series are good. I enjoyed all the music used and thought it fit the mood of each episode and series as a whole. The characters are unique from one another. You don&#039;t have the cookie cutter anime girl used for all the females. Plus, they are all animated very well. <br />
<br />
Other than that, you have the fan service. The fan service definitely plays a huge role in this series, and is present in almost every episode. Although, I must say that I don&#039;t feel it was being shoved down my throat as with some other series. <br />
<br />
Overall, if you are looking for a series that has action, beautiful girls, and dragons, this show is for you. It has great deal of fan service, and the story will keep you entertained. It is a fun ride, though very predictable, but in the end will keep your interest if you don&#039;t over analyze it. <br />

    Seikoku no Dragnoar a typical generic harem but with dragons and power ranger armour.<br />
Actual Score: 6.8<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story is highly predictable in a sense of its harem nature as it follows MC helps girl, girl falls in love and gets added to the harem which is basically what happens during most of the show. Yes there are dragons are very cool and one of the best aspects of the show but if what you want is a serious story your not going to find but it is a fun ride though and is not boring.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
The art is fairly normal its not crap but its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147885">
        not good its okay; but the dragons I found to be well done and were the only things that really stood out me from the rest of the art.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The opening and endings of the show where nothing to interesting with a fairly mild piece as the opening that was skipped every time but the ending was more interesting and fitted the show well.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
The characters of show were ok but were to flat as most followed there classic harem archetypes like the Tsundere e.g Eco and Silivia and the heroic male Ash who without the help of the girls and his one awesome super power would be a pile of charcoal by the 2nd episode also he is really nice. But aside from some of them do get some character development which does give the characters more depth and creates a bigger interest.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Now then I did enjoy the show as it was a break from all the serious anime of spring 2014 and was a fun ride all the way through but was a bit too predictable.

    Seikoku no Dragonar is set in an alternative universe were people can be chosen to bare a pal, or dragon, during a certain age. Its genres are ecchi and harem, and so you can&#039;t really expect much from it. While people may complain about its overuse of large breasts just to use as fan service and eye candy for the audience, this is expected for typical harem and so is easily understandable in this review.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
As mentioned before, this is a stereotypical harem laced with lots of ecchi scenes. It&#039;s got everything in it to qualify it as a harem and so most scenes placed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146239">
        throughout the entire anime are easy to undermine and could, in most cases, be classified as cliche. While this may be true, the anime still presents to us an interesting story line filled with unexpected twists that would make you watch more, despite its overuse of ecchi scenes you would see in just about any harem anime. Adding to this fact, its pacing is slightly too fast, yet is a bit understandable at times.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The first thing you would think of when watching this anime is that ITS ART IS SO HIGH QUALITY. Actions done by the characters are done very fluidly with its backgrounds also drawn with the same amount of detail. Despite this said, there are not really any scenes where the art would take your breath away. They all seem to be there just because they need to be there and in that quality to match. Its purpose is to basically present its surroundings simply for you to forget about it a few seconds later. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Not that much to say about sound. The OP and ED are catchy and the voices really match their characters. The stereotypical tsundere gets an abnormally high, yet cute voice and the somewhat arrogant princess gets a low proud voice that still never fails to actually say certain inappropriate lines that, in the end, may sound much more befitting to her character. That said, its sound affects are things that we&#039;ve already heard before, nothing special, but still very appropriate to whatever is played out to us.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
We have a tsundere dragon that has some kind of connection with the queen of Avalon, a stubborn princess that refuses to say what she really feels, and a dense male protagonist, who for some inexplicable reason, gets himself a special dragon that comes in a form of a human girl. If you ask me, thats just about all you need to make up a harem anime. Though we are given quite a bit of development behind them, the very fundamentals of each of their characters are still very much missing. I, personally, is very keen to know who exactly Ash&#039;s parents and how exactly did he meet the princess so easily. Moving away from that, some characters also just come and go very quickly. Most appear out of nowhere just to give some random fan service. With this, this part of the review gives a five to its characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
Despite all of these setbacks, the enjoyment factor of this anime is very high, though that may just be for me. Of course, people who don&#039;t like the harem and ecchi genres would think otherwise, but there is a reason to why this anime was categorised under these titles. Why would someone who can&#039;t take horror watch a horror anime? Even if one did, their review would be bias by saying &#039;its too scary&#039; when that is the whole point of the anime. Getting back on topic, this anime is so far very enjoyable. Though the stereotypical harem jokes may seem like nothing, some are still nonetheless rather funny. Action scenes are also well capable of stealing your attention away and putting you back on its semi serious plot. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
Not too high and not too low. This is an anime to be watched and forget about, though it does show some potential to move away from that. It is recommended that you watch it when you are bored and just want to kill time.

    This is my first ever review so bear with me, this may look sloppy<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally i liked this anime even though many didnt and i would say that much of it belongs to the ending that most people dont agree with, one of those people being myself. Though i am not saying that you wont.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
<br />
The story is pretty interesting though it has alot of Familiar of Zero feel to it, i liked the story as it was an interesting take on the situation<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
<br />
The opening and ending music were very disappointing to me, i didnt enjoy either and i would mainly skip them which is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190583">
        something i wouldnt normally do, i will say though during battles the music is grand and works well with the action<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
Dont have much to say about the art, though if i would put it somewhere i would put it here; i enjoyed the fan service as there is a good amount in this show though this may be a turn off for some of you guys out there<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
Good character development for most of the main characters though some of the more side characters are mainly forgotten about but i really like the bunch of main characters and they were enjoyable to me <br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
I liked this show as i thought it was cool with the dragon concept and the weapons that they could use were all really cool to me. The only parts i really disliked was the honestly the ending which i cant stand.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would very much so want a second season to this as it would be a favorite show of mine if they were to tweak a few things in the story

    I won&#039;t be reviewing the story now, but rather critizing the anime itself, so try not to pay attention to the ratings as that wasn&#039;t anything I spent any time on.<br />
<br />
At first when I spotted this anime and saw it&#039;s low score I was really hesitant to whether or not I should watch it, but I decided I&#039;d give it a try as I&#039;m desperate with finding new &#039;watchable&#039; animes.<br />
<br />
The anime started out decently and I was quite early ready to score it a &quot;9&quot; but which gradually dropped to &quot;8&quot; and now at the end of the story I&#039;m at &quot;7&quot; asking myself if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148505">
        I praise the anime too much.<br />
Yet you somehow continue to watch the anime hoping it will turn to the better.<br />
<br />
People talk about Fanservice, some people are for and some people are against it and personally I&#039;m a fan of service. But the Fanservice in this anime was poor, not poor as in &quot;just from time to time&quot; but poor as in it was badly made. I wish for more kisses and romance when it comes to fanservice, this was pure tentacle fanservice that I found gross.<br />
<br />
Besides from 90% of the anime&#039;s main characters being female and the protagonist who at first sight seemed to be interesting is in truth nothing but a wimp uncapable of thinking for himself. A weak wimp that is that can only rely on the females around him, I also don&#039;t like how the story progresses<br />
.<br />
It sort of feels like that the protagonist makes irrational decisions purely to favour the &#039;bad guys&#039; in the anime so their plot can continue to then when he face them which he wouldn&#039;t even have needed to in the first place if he would just have considered his options, he can&#039;t do anything but rely on the females in the harem once again.<br />
<br />
This are just my thoughts, thanks for reading.<br />

    Seikoku no Dragonar is an interesting anime, and probably one of the few I find quite enjoyable about dragons. As most people would suspect, the comedy ecchi harem action genre isn&#039;t exactly new, and this anime makes no exceptions in that. It doesn&#039;t deviate too much to typical cliche and it doesn&#039;t do anything super special either. The story is what you expect from this type of genre, and the character development is about average. I feel the story is probably where it falls a little short as it isn&#039;t spectacular or even anything that you would find surprising.<br />
<br />
In saying that though I personally loved

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152713">
        this anime, it was enjoyable as the main character actually attempted to fight, and the few female characters also added the needed substance for this anime. I found myself laughing a few times, and even caring about the characters which is a really good sign. The action unfortunately feels quite short, considering a 12 episode anime, its understandable but it loses its impact if the character either wins or loses within a few minutes. <br />
<br />
I thought the art was done nicely enough, and I was able to happily marathon the whole show in one sitting. In the end though this seems like the sort of anime which will appeal to a certain group of people but not all. While the fan service was quite comedic, certain choices such as tentacle monsters really detract from the overall story, at first it felt like a bad boss to fight, and the next second you are having a hard time taking it seriously since tentacles come out, and then you wonder whether the main character is even fighting it at all or if its just some sort of fan service monster. Ultimately that feels like the biggest fault for me, I would have a better feel of the characters if they fought monsters doing more then just adding fan service.<br />
<br />
Still though there was enough typical action, the male lead wasn&#039;t a complete wuss like some anime, and I felt like I enjoyed the ending.<br />
<br />
My last thoughts are, if you are the type of person who enjoys action harems, can tolerate the fan service, and enjoyed anime such as machine doll and familiar of zero. You will likely enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
If you prefer anime with a more in depth plot, something you have to seriously think about or something that will be completely amazing, then this probably won&#039;t be the first choice on your list.

    Don&#039;t go into this anime expecting a great story and nice characters/(developement) because there isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
This is your standart harem/magic/school anime in a fantasy world. (If you have some anime of the sort I haven&#039;t watched yet feel free to pm me ;))<br />
The characters don&#039;t really have anything special going for them but that doesn&#039;t mean this show is bad. It&#039;s not the greatest, sure, but it&#039;s not necessarily bad. It&#039;s just your typical show with a more or less predicatable storyline.<br />
There is our main dude. And as the show progresses more and more girls seem to fall in love with him, pretty standart.<br />
The art for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301250">
        quite pleasant but again nothing crazy good, same goes for the music.<br />
<br />
All in all a quite predicatable show with matching characters.<br />
<br />
Still, I enjoyed this show.<br />
<br />
If you just wan&#039;t to watch a harem with some &quot;hot&quot; girls and a bit of action then go for it, if you are looking for more than that, it&#039;s probably not for you.<br />

    There was *some* potential for this series, but I think it&#039;s been overstated in other reviews. The main characters start off being interesting, and the setting is somewhat generic but passable.<br />
<br />
However, after watching the show it quickly becomes obvious that any potential is buried deep underneath a pile of fan service, generic anime tropes, and overall terrible writing. Idk about the source material, but the show managed to annoy me every few minutes; there is basically no explanation or self-consistency for the magic, things just get resolved randomly, and the plot drags on aimlessly at times.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
<br />
The characters are forgettable. After re-watching the first few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330598">
        episodes, all I could think about is how predictable and one-dimensional they are (not to mention dumb at times). It&#039;s like everything I hate about bad shounen characters and harem characters rolled into one.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
<br />
But this is an ecchi/comedy, so what about that? Well, while ecchi is heavily emphasized, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an excuse for the plot and characters being so insufferable. As for comedy, most of it came from the main character being embarrassed that naked girls keep on throwing themselves at him. The art is average, and doesn&#039;t make up for the show&#039;s failure in other respects.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound: 5<br />
<br />
In the end, I think this show only succeeds as an ecchi, and an OK one at that. When the story and characters only detract from the titillation, there&#039;s obviously something wrong.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall: 3
