    Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen Review<br />
_______________________________________________________<br />
<br />
I have included a tl;dr near the bottom of this review if the length is too long. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I have played both the Danganronpa 1 and 2 games to completion and have been following the series for years. (For reference, I would probably give the games about a 6/10) THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THIS SERIES AND MINOR SPOILERS FOR THE GAMES.<br />
<br />
If a mystery is a typical &quot;whodunnit&quot; (as DR3 is), it sometimes relies a bit too much on the inevitable twist of the reveal of the culprit. However, it only requires a shift in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230545">
        perspective to create a quality story and to not become another entry into the dreaded &quot;mystery box&quot; genre. I have never been the biggest fan of mysteries in general because the mystery alone usually isn&#039;t enough to create an engaging narrative, and I feel this is how most genre contemporaries present themselves. Even the ones that don&#039;t struggle to make thoroughly enticing mystery-based stories because they usually won&#039;t leave much of an impression unless they blow your fucking mind to smithereens. It&#039;s a flawed, finicky genre to me because whenever I come across a mystery with decent/good characters, the mysteries always end up lackluster, and vice versa. Basically, the mystery shows I do like have elements that appeal to me other than the feeling of &quot;Oooh, what&#039;s gonna happen?? Maybe something interesting in the future!&quot; Historically, Danganronpa is a series that tries not to fall into this trap by having a wide array of characters, cool settings, and exciting court cases. I don&#039;t think the games are anything special, but they are competent enough to have some fun with. It&#039;s when the adaptation of the first Danganronpa game came out that the problems with the story and characters were enhanced twofold and made incredibly apparent. Plot holes arising from removed dialogue, one-note characters who die without garnering any sympathy and poor characterization for the ones that remain alive, mind-boggling pacing, and it just felt like sitting around waiting for interesting things to happen only to realize that they never will. It really sucked. However, after some time passed, Danganronpa 3 was announced. It was touted as a completely original project designed to end the story of the first two games, meaning they had significantly more creative freedom to work with. Gone are the days of attempting to cram 30+ hours of content into 13 regular-sized episodes. Suffice to say, despite its best efforts, Danganronpa 3 Future Arc fails to impress. It so woefully falls flat in every area that it makes the entire series look like a joke, and if this is how the series is going to end, then I am painfully let down. How this has little in the way of negative reviews at the time of this writing and even held an average score above an 8 on MAL (which is what some of my favorites don&#039;t even get) for a long period of time makes no sense to me.<br />
<br />
And yeah, this show falls into every possible trap regarding bad mystery stories. It&#039;s boring, spins its wheels, has lame characters, and is ridiculously stupid. However, if it were that simple, I wouldn&#039;t be writing this review. I&#039;m going to get to the bottom of the mystery within a mystery: what happened to Danganronpa?<br />
<br />
Let’s begin with talking about the thing that immediately struck me as terrible - the presentation. The color design is truly abysmal, with the dominant colors being black, gray, brown, and a disgusting shade of red that pervades through certain parts. A show so inundated with lifeless scenes of characters standing around talking is bound to be much more interesting with this lovely palette applied. Unfortunately, the area the characters inhabit while standing in a bunch of dark, empty rooms and hallways may be the main culprit of the horrible visual design. Somewhere along the line, I’m sure a decision was made to make Danganronpa 3 “darker” than previous installments, because it is the conclusion after all. While I believe this only applied in the literal sense with the final product, they did make the blood red, which finally makes Danganronpa the mature series I’ve been waiting for. However, it’s possible that after they spent a hundred painstaking hours using the paint bucket tool on the splashes of blood, they forgot to make the setting something other than a gray mass of boring concrete. While the art design in the Danganronpa games is not exceptional, I at least felt like I “knew” the location I was in, and the scenery was usually quite unique depending on where you were in the school or the island. It&#039;s true that this it&#039;s easier to evoke this feeling in a game, but it&#039;s not unheard of to use directing tricks and good shot composition to communicate the setting through the visuals. but DR3 just doesn&#039;t do this. The director, Kishi Seiji, is rather hit-or-miss for me. I don&#039;t care for Yuuki Yuuna, Persona 4, Seto no Hanayome, or Carnival Phantasm, and nor did I find the directing in any of those shows particularly standout. But I do like Angel Beats, and Humanity has Declined is one of my favorite shows of all time. Even then, the directing in these shows is one of their weaker elements, especially Humanity has Declined (it&#039;s still good, though), which could have benefited from a more unconventional style. Why any of this matters is because I think it proves Seiji alone probably doesn&#039;t have the means to salvage a show with a terrible script and weak art direction. The camera angles and constant uses of bland panning shots and character zoom-ins illustrate that Seiji was constricted by the claustrophobic nature of DR3&#039;s setting. However, take everything I&#039;ve said with a grain of salt because I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s easy to place the blame on anyone involved with an anime&#039;s production. To continue a bit further, (this is almost equally the fault of the writing), the sense of space between characters is conveyed so poorly it&#039;s practically a non-entity, removing any tension and making the murders that happen unbelievably dull. There&#039;s no standout scenery or any kind of important landmarks to help alleviate this, further disengaging me as a viewer. There was a clear lack of creative vision with this show, which is made blindingly obvious through the absence of any cohesiveness or suspense in its presentation. <br />
<br />
The animation is not impressive, or fluid in the slightest, even during key moments when characters are fighting or whatever, and I really hate how the lighting is occasionally too dark to clearly see what&#039;s going on. I, myself, have never been a huge fan of the DR art style, but even I think that the way it is converted into the anime format looks kind of ugly, especially the characters. I just can&#039;t stand their odd face shapes and strangely designed eyes, and this is amplified when they&#039;re moving. All of the aforementioned issues with the presentation combine to create a tedious viewing experience that only makes me think about how I could be better using my time. Basically, the idea that anyone can look at this series and get invested even the slightest bit is baffling to me, especially since this atrocious presentation is a pretty big reason that I can barely get through an episode without falling asleep. <br />
<br />
The dialogue is laughably horrific. It&#039;s truly devoid of any creativity or flair, and is never enjoyable. Characters (though mostly Munakata) are given bafflingly stupid lines that often made me do a double-take and burst out laughing. I would go out of my way to provide some specific examples, but I don&#039;t exactly have the time, and it was something that was just apparent to me all throughout the series. All that results from the poor script is the reinforcement of the vacuous, unenjoyable presentation. And, even though I praised it for being unintentionally funny, whenever the show actually attempts comedy, it always comes up painfully flat. Isn&#039;t it hilarious that Naegi&#039;s sister might have incestuous feelings for him because that&#039;s a thing that&#039;s popular in anime right now?? Also, Hagakure&#039;s character is intended as comedic relief but, surprise, he just fails hard at it, and since this is his only purpose in the show, it quickly gets on my nerves. This might seem like a pedantic complaint, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily wrong to ask for some kind of self-awareness in the writing, which it &quot;attempts&quot; to do, but it comes off as a mere wink and a nod to current trends more so than humor derived from the characters or the situations. Maybe this is because all of the characters are so unimaginably flat that it&#039;s hard to write any enjoyable scenes with them? Hmm...no way! Anyway, I always appreciate series that go out of their way to acknowledge their own ridiculousness, but DR3 sucks at doing this, resulting in a never-ending spiral of boredom.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a fun drinking game you can do with the script: take a shot every time a character says &quot;hope&quot; or &quot;despair.&quot; Actually, to prevent death by alcohol poisoning, you should just pick one of the words and have your buddy take the other. <br />
<br />
Oh, and the soundtrack, at least from what I can remember, is comprised of reused or slightly remixed songs from the games, so who gives a shit about that. I&#039;m not saying I dislike Danganronpa music, quite the opposite in fact, but the lack of originality just makes it all the more tiring to sit through.  <br />
<br />
So if the series isn&#039;t nice to look at and nothing is presented in a compelling way, like, 100% of the time, its characters and plot must make up for it, right?! After all, Welcome to the N.H.K is a series that happens to have notoriously horrible and inconsistent visuals, but it still remains a great show because the other aspects hold it up so well. Now here&#039;s a revelation that&#039;s as predictable as any plot twist in this anime: this is not the case with DR3.<br />
<br />
I want to address my most hated plot device before delving into the characters and overarching story: Forbidden Actions. Here&#039;s the rundown: all the characters trapped inside the remains of the Future Foundation building have a cuff around their arms that dictates what actions they cannot see or do, and if they perform or witness said action, they die (almost) instantly. If you fail to comprehend why I believe this is so retarded, then let me explain: this is the writers blatantly including deus ex machinas as a functioning component of the story. By the way, the audience is NOT made aware of every characters&#039; Forbidden Actions, and in fact, viewers are intentionally left in the dark on this. Why? If this was an attempt to add tension, it actually has the opposite effect. There&#039;s nothing gratifying whatsoever in learning that someone&#039;s Forbidden Action happens to correlate to a scene that that character is a part of. They exist as nothing more than a device to conveniently kill characters whenever the writers think it&#039;s &quot;best&quot; to do so, which is one of the most obnoxious methods of stringing along that I&#039;ve ever seen in a mystery story, and it only hurts the anime&#039;s endeavor to make me care about what&#039;s going on. Surprisingly, even though DR3 is going for a more serious tone, every single time Forbidden Actions are important or even mentioned at all, it results in unintentionally hilarious scenes. Like, holy shit, Naegi&#039;s Forbidden Action is that he can&#039;t run in the hallway, and he has to piggyback on one of the characters if there&#039;s anywhere he wants to go. Hahahaha, what the fuck? One character is killed off early on in order to showcase how deadly these Forbidden Actions can be, but his requirement came off as incredibly forced as a result of this. The chances of said Action not occurring were so low that his death was practically unavoidable. In contrast, I was certain, from the second Naegi&#039;s was revealed, that it would never become a problem at any point in the story. Enthralling. <br />
<br />
Danganronpa 3&#039;s characters were doomed to be fucking awful as soon as it was announced the run time for the series would be 12 episodes. Yeah, good luck developing those 15-20 relevant characters and/or making the audience even remotely care about them when they inevitably die. I guess for a lot of people, the fact that characters die is enough to make them tear up, but I hate any kind of story that hinges on this because it feels manipulative, like the story can&#039;t get me naturally endeared to its cast without resorting to sob stories and the constant threat of death. As it stands, DR3&#039;s cardboard cutouts masquerading as characters fail to interest or compel me to care. All of them can be boiled down to a single (less than compelling) personality trait, and whenever they try(emphasis on try) to show depth beyond that, they die without accomplishing anything. You know so little about them that whenever the show tries to &quot;subvert&quot; your expectations with regards to their actions, it&#039;s never surprising because you&#039;re given no reason to believe they couldn&#039;t do that. It&#039;s a very boring and lame way of handling characters because it just involves way too much stringing along, which is already highly prevalent in most mystery shows. I would slot every character into either &quot;obnoxious fuck-face&quot; or &quot;literally nothing&quot; anyway, and this, in addition to the overbearing grimdark tone, results in no scene ever being fun. All of this just makes the telegraphed deaths that much more annoying.<br />
<br />
Audience: Hmm, I wonder...this character is getting more lines of dialogue and screen time than normal...haha, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just a coincidence!<br />
<br />
To add to my frustration even further, I just hate and can&#039;t make sense of most of the character&#039;s actions. To give an example, in episode 1, I found it insurmountably frustrating that Naegi wouldn&#039;t tell the Future Foundation why he held the Despairs captive and that he ran an experiment on them. How convenient that there&#039;s an overly angry guy there so that Naegi could be punched and have an excuse not to talk! Even worse than this, Munakata is a character that I just cannot understand no matter how hard I try. He seems to kill people at complete random and for no discernible reason, and screams really loudly about hope and despair because of his dead girlfriend (By the way, it&#039;s not just Munakata - none of the characters&#039; motivations makes any sense). However, the scene that&#039;s the worst offender of complete and utter stupidity, and embodies all of my problems with the way characters act in this anime is the one in which (Spoiler) Ruruka kills Izayoi. The leaps in logic and sheer ridiculousness of this scene combined with the fact that it is taking itself 100% seriously makes me laugh so hard. It has absolutely no impact as an emotional scene, and both of the characters&#039; attitudes and lines of thinking verge on complete insanity, resulting in a strange feeling where I not only feel no sympathy whatsoever, but I CANNOT bring myself to care no matter what. None of this is helped by the fact that not a single character feels like he/she has a life outside of the idiotic lines that they spew, making them painfully shallow and even harder to care for on closer inspection. I don&#039;t think it would be a stretch to say that there is no characterization in this show, because every characters&#039; actions are hand-waved with DESPAIR. What can they do? They&#039;re in DESPAIR MODE after all.<br />
<br />
The returning main characters remain stagnant throughout the episodes, making the experience even more dull than it needs to be. Yep, Naegi is still screaming about hope and people around him are still getting killed despite this. I would love to get behind his ideals, (that are practically a repeat of what they were in DR1) but the writers only make Naegi look like more of a dumbass since there are very few limitations to the death game. In DR1, Naegi&#039;s ideals of hope had significance since the &quot;death game&quot; actually had RULES and CONSEQUENCES. The characters don&#039;t actually want to kill each other, but it is promised that if they do, then they would be able to escape their despairing situation. This, in combination with some blackmailing by Monokuma makes it more believable that they might kill to achieve freedom, thereby creating a scenario where Naegi&#039;s &quot;hope&quot; has thematic relevance. In DR3 Future, everyone can just kill without any repercussions, and in fact, the whole event is treated like a free-for-all. Too bad every character is either a fucking insane person who doesn&#039;t mind killing people for the flimsiest of reasons, and/or a person who has a horrible gripe with someone else. If this wasn&#039;t the case, everyone would have to be human beings with relatable emotions and Naegi&#039;s morals might actually help the situation! What a shame. Now look, I&#039;m not advocating for DR3 to have the exact same message that the original game does, but since they just copy-pasted the plot setup and general feel of the game, it only invites this kind of criticism. What the hell kind of message is it even going for if not this? As far as Kirigiri goes, she&#039;s basically worthless and gets completely relegated to the sidelines. Possible wasted potential? Eh, I don&#039;t care anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the only logical conclusion that one can draw from what I&#039;ve said is that DR3 is not character driven, right? Maybe the characters were only made to serve a narrative purpose in order to create a more compelling mystery plot. This is obviously totally wrong and there&#039;s no redeeming this piece of shit at this point, but let&#039;s perform an examination anyway.... <br />
<br />
I think it should be noted that class trials have been removed entirely. The gimmick created to &quot;compensate&quot; for this is as follows: at a certain time, every character except  ONE &quot;culprit&quot; is forcefully put to sleep. Aside from making the whole series really boring, I believe this gimmick is even more idiotic than at first glance. How the fuck is anyone supposed to figure out who did these murders? You can argue that the same thing would happen without this gimmick because a culprit would typically make his move after everyone is asleep, but I beg to differ. Every character&#039;s sleep is controlled, so I&#039;m assuming that they cannot be woke as well. This removes certain variables that make mysteries interesting. Maybe one character doesn&#039;t sleep well, so he overhears something strange in the middle of the night. Maybe a character intentionally stays awake in order to observe whether or not someone does something suspicious. Call these things overly convenient, but they&#039;re still possibilities that can shake up a normal mystery and allow the audience to soak in fucking CLUES so they can solve it themselves. In DR3, the murderer and his victims come off as a half-assed attempt at adding some air of intrigue and mystery in the background, instead of being front-and-center like they SHOULD BE. The characters, including Kirigiri, the supposed &quot;Ultimate Detective,&quot; just sort of look at the victims and say &quot;Yeah, they&#039;re dead all right!&quot; and move on without dwelling on each murder. That&#039;s because there&#039;s nothing to analyze about them whatsoever. There is one point in episode 8 where Kirigiri actually conducts an investigation that yields results, but this was for the sole purpose of a &quot;riveting&quot; plot twist (involving Forbidden Actions LOL) where the killer was someone besides the &quot;actual&quot; culprit. So, as far as the culprit to each murder goes, no one could have possibly observed who did the murders, and unless the killer is completely stupid, no one will be able to figure it out. Why did they even make this mechanic a thing? It&#039;s like they intentionally didn&#039;t want there to be interesting investigations or cases. What&#039;s stopping the culprit from killing everyone? The rules are so un-specific when they really need to be otherwise plot holes like this will come up. I have honestly hurt my fucking brain trying to think of the logic behind this plot device, so I&#039;ll stop here.<br />
<br />
By the way, I am aware of the plot twist at the end of the series, but my issue is how this controlled sleep thing weakens the mystery the show builds up by having numerous apparent flaws and just making everything boring. I already hate trying to figure out &quot;whodunnit,&quot; so I doubt I would like the story even without this plot device. My beef with it is how it forces obligatory murders to happen throughout the show and how solving the mystery is impossible, so why even include the plot device at all when it actively makes your death game show have no tension or intrigue. <br />
<br />
Speaking of that plot twist, Despair Video anyone? How about a Hope Video? How about the worst idea ever? Oh wait, I repeated myself three times. Honestly, do I need to say why this is so stupid? I didn&#039;t care about anything by the time the Videos were revealed, so I was just laughing along at the practical joke that was the conclusion of Danganronpa 3. Do you even understand the implications of videos that instantly cause hope and despair? It&#039;s world-altering to the point that I&#039;m sure this is going to be the only major source of conflict the Danganronpa series will use from now on. The hope and despair thing has already gotten out of hand, and they just promoted it to a world-class meme. Congrats, I had a few laughs, but in retrospect, it&#039;s not that funny. It severely cheapens Junko&#039;s character because it proves that she was not an influential, persuasive figure, but instead that she just used god powers to make everyone feel despair!!!! Lame. You know what the best Despair Video is? An episode of Danganronpa 3. <br />
<br />
Well, that&#039;s it. You should have a clear idea of what I hate about the show by now if you even bothered to read this far, so I&#039;ll just complain about minor plot details until the end of the review.<br />
<br />
In order to drag you into my next point, let&#039;s just imagine a world where Munakata (the Future Foundation guy with a katana) is the culprit in one of the murders. Since law and order has been completely disposed of, there is no conceivable way anyone would be able to stop that guy from fucking killing everyone. He, along with a few other characters, seem to have incredible super strength the likes of which have never been seen in Danganronpa. No, actually, Sakura from DR1 had a crazy, over-the-top fight with Monokuma, but this could be justified since it was a one time occurrence and could be passed off as some sort of joke, and the fact that Sakura is the ULTIMATE WRESTLER. (Not to mention that this somewhat fits with the tone of the games. Just watch any execution to understand that DR has a bit of craziness to it) Munakata is the Ultimate STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT. Wow, I didn&#039;t know that student council presidents were flame katana wielding badasses that have superhuman fighting prowess. These ridiculous fights that happen pretty frequently in DR3 have no real justification for why each character is so damn powerful. There&#039;s a character that can demolish a wall with his bare hands, and to justify this, they slapped Sakura&#039;s title of wrestler onto him. Wow, good thing he was killed off early or else he would have been a problem! According to the creators, this is supposed to be a &quot;darker&quot; take on Danganronpa, so why are there so many tension-less, over-the-top fights? I dunno, I guess it would be too boring if they all had to be rational, normal human beings, and this is an anime after all! LOL amirite??!!!<br />
<br />
All I can say about the narrative of DR3 is that it is dumb. There&#039;s no real way to infer that this is going to be the finale of the entire series other than the fact that Monokuma himself says so. Why is this the final killing game? On that note, why did it even need to be a killing game? It&#039;s not like the people that are trapped are the only non-Despairs left; there are other branches of the Future Foundation out there with many people working in each of them. The anime does not attempt at setting any kind of stakes, yet the series is making this out like this is the biggest and most epic incident to ever happen to humanity. What about Togami&#039;s special military force and access to high-end technology and military weapons? I can&#039;t imagine any despairs accomplishing much with those in the way, even if the other Future Foundation branches somehow cease functions. Not to mention, there&#039;s a very high chance that multiple people are going to walk away from the death game alive and be able to resume leading the work of their branch of the Future Foundation, so this killing game seems like it has a 100% chance to accomplish....pretty much nothing. Viewers can only assume that the new person controlling Monokuma is a legitimate retard. <br />
<br />
The series doesn&#039;t even bother having a real ending, either. The last few episodes are just a clusterfuck of random plot contrivances strung together in such a way that barely resembles a story topped off with massive plot holes that contradict the entire series (Junko mind control). There&#039;s little to say about the last couple episodes that I haven&#039;t already mentioned in this review other than they were incredibly boring and stupid and I hated every second of them (oh wait you could&#039;ve guessed that). My brain was hazing over during the viewing of these episodes, so I apologize for the lack of an in-depth analysis on how the resolution actually makes no sense whatsoever. I honestly didn&#039;t give a fuck at this point. <br />
<br />
So...what was the point of this anime? It has horrible characters, a mess of a plot, and is generally boring to watch thanks in part to the garbage presentation. As far as thematic elements go, it&#039;s incredibly weak as well. Although I don&#039;t particularly care all that much for the games&#039; themes, they at least have purpose in furthering the story as well as giving it a sub-textual point, which is better than not having one. In DR3, the words &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;despair&quot; are spouted off with such reckless abandon that the whole project seems more so an effort to make the anime &quot;feel&quot; like Danganronpa than actually trying to integrate this theme into the story or add anything new to the mix. I got nothing meaningful out of any of the characters or their actions, or any underlying themes that aren&#039;t already present in the first two games. <br />
<br />
Maybe they just didn&#039;t know where to go with the series and decided to quickly shit out a conclusion. This is actually really accurate the more I think about it, especially after watching the ending of the series, Kibou-hen. It&#039;s the dream ending that every Danganronpa fan wanted. It ties everything together in such a perfectly neat little bow that many people probably thought it was the best thing ever. However, I believe it is wholly unsatisfying and only served to re-emphasize the weaknesses of the series. Nothing that happens in Kibou-hen feels like a natural course-of-progress. Everything is being pushed toward this one goal point that MUST be reached for some reason. It has no time to stop for a breather and let its audience care about what is going on. Characters are magically resurrected from the dead with a stupid, hand-waved explanation, making me wonder why they died in the first place. Scenes that are made out to be emotionally charged are nothing more than a joke due to the lack of focus and development. Characters do their one &quot;thing&quot; that they&#039;re known for, and show no depth beyond that. It all feels so hollow and decidedly not genuine. If this is the ending everyone wanted, then I hope you&#039;re all happy, but I personally would&#039;ve liked some more thought put into how they would reach this point. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________<br />
I&#039;ve said most of what I wanted to say about DR3. So here is where I&#039;ll place my exceedingly minor, miscellaneous complaints about the series that I couldn&#039;t fit into the review and end it off afterwords.<br />
<br />
I severely dislike that Monokuma is given barely any lines in this anime. To me, he was one of the best parts of the games, and to a much smaller extent, the original anime. His dialogue was usually entertaining, and his attempts to stir up despair in each of the characters was neat. The fact that Monokuma barely says anything in DR3 illustrates that the writers were probably very lazy and didn&#039;t want to think up any creative things for him to say. Or maybe they felt he wasn&#039;t needed because the tone is darker...yeah....that&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
Why is Hagakure even in this shit? He does literally nothing and is incredibly extraneous(actually I could say this about most characters, SHIT). It could have been interesting to handle a character who wasn&#039;t trapped within the building, especially since he was one of my favorites in the game, but they just seem to treat him as a joke since he just shits around doing nothing the whole series. What a masterful use of all available resources, DR3 writers!<br />
<br />
I almost completely forgot about Asahina, but I think it should be mentioned that her only role in DR3 is to act as Naegi&#039;s legs whenever he needs to run in a hallway. While this is funny, it also makes me believe that she didn&#039;t even need to stay alive because she&#039;s actually a super boring character. This could either be a fault of the writers generally being incompetent, or her character being too reliant on Sakura for any intrigue, or both. At least she wasn&#039;t a fanservice vehicle I guess? <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really care about the subplot with Monaka. I didn&#039;t play Ultra Despair Girls because I think it looks like a shitty game, but I think her character was entirely unnecessary in the context of this anime. It doesn&#039;t help that the episode where she is the focus, episode 7, is probably one of the worst in the series due to the amount of unnecessary fanservice and general pointlessness of its plot. I guess her purpose was to be a misdirect by making you think she was the one who trapped everyone in the building, but this kind of fails to be convincing since they reveal her identity relatively early on. All she manages to do is take up an unneeded amount of screen time that all ends up being for naught in the end. However, I&#039;ll admit she is involved with what is probably the most entertaining scene in the whole show, if only for its absurdity. <br />
<br />
The bullshit at the end of episode 8 LOL. The writers realized that Togami could just rescue them all so they ass-pulled super hard and made it so this couldn&#039;t happen. This made me burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
I hate how DR3 Future Arc relies on its companion series &quot;Despair Arc&quot; to develop its dead characters. Not only is it hard to care about them because you know they&#039;re dead, but they usually aren&#039;t given enough screen time to make an impact, which is somewhat due to their rushed portrayal, but also because there are so many characters to focus on. It&#039;s the same problem that Akame ga Kill has, where the increasing number of character deaths is proportional to the amount of not giving a fuck. To be honest, Despair Arc suffers from many of the same problems that Future Arc does. The only edge it has over Future Arc is that my pre-knowledge of the characters from my play-through of DR2 allows me to enjoy it a tiny bit more. However, this is also a reason why I find it boring since I&#039;ve already been over these characters once before, and it doesn&#039;t seem too keen on adding more to them. I will probably never watch more than the first episode of this series.<br />
<br />
I think that this show&#039;s most damning sin, though, is how cheap it all feels. I could chalk this up to any aspect that I have criticized so far, but for the perfect example, you need look no further than the ending of each episode. They&#039;re ALL cliffhangers in one way or the other. Oh no! What if Asahina is dead?! I don&#039;t actually care because she&#039;s been given zero meaningful scenes so far, but oh the humanity!!! You probably get the point, but I still believe the worst offender of this is the faked death of Kirigiri, who is the most beloved character in DR (for some reason). She was so fucking worthless before then that I was applauding at how much they made me not care at the prospect of her dying. I&#039;m actually not bashing cliffhangers as a concept necessarily (though I do dislike them) because I can understand the need to occasionally incite some hype on the part of the audience, and I don&#039;t really watch shows weekly, so I don&#039;t care as much. But is DR3 that desperate for views? I&#039;d even say that including cliffhangers at the frequency that this show does is downright detrimental to its quality. It makes the pacing feel really off, since the inclusion of these cliffhangers is at the expense of entire episodes being total snooze fests. It almost seems like the writers were forcing themselves to construct episodes like this, and this could either be because the content they had to work with is legitimately not that interesting or because they were under a preconceived notion that Danganronpa was ONLY about characters dying, and they wanted to play it up as much as possible. Could also be both, or neither. Needless to say, it&#039;s annoying. It&#039;s funny because all of this is practically an emulation of those excellent episodes of Humanity has Declined (sup Seiji), but instead of becoming self-aware of their wrongdoings like the great characters in that show, the DR3 writers charge ahead without any shred of guilt regarding the manipulation of their own audience. Despicable, and definitely not an example to be followed. <br />
<br />
By the way, I have been filled in on some of what happens in Despair Arc, so I can confirm that the way the stories intertwine is horribly done and (surprisingly) makes me hate it more. Hurray for hand-waving the entire plot with the most ridiculously boring plot device imaginable!  <br />

REVIEW TL;DR: Incredibly weak presentation on all fronts, fails at being visually interesting, has dull and idiotic dialogue, lack of attention to detail (especially in the setting), stupid plot devices that make little sense, unrelentingly boring, poorly done characters that fail at being engaging, mystery falls flat no matter if you watch this series alone or with its companion show, lacks thematic depth, plot holes that contradict the series&#039; lore, overall disappointment in every major plot point, and has so many more details that annoy me to no end. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
All in all, what a disappointment. Actually, to be honest, I had low expectations to begin with. Especially when given a 12 episode run time, it&#039;s plain to see that the Danganronpa formula has no merit when converted into animated format. They could&#039;ve gone in many different directions to compensate for this (such as not making it another killing game maybe??), but instead they only opted to do something VERY slightly different while simultaneous stripping the DR formula of its necessary parts, and failed spectacularly as a result. <br />
<br />
Is it possible that I&#039;ve just gotten tired of Danganronpa over the years? Maybe this is true. After all, the games suffer from a few of the problems I&#039;ve listed in this review and have their fair share of other annoyances. This anime certainly didn&#039;t help, with it essentially shitting all over both of the games&#039; stories. I&#039;ve also grown quite tired of the &quot;death game&quot; format of story, as most of the common plot elements in it bore me to tears now. <br />
 <br />
Even still, I fondly remember playing Danganronpa on the Vita the day it came out. It was the same for its sequel, too. I remember absolutely loving these games and obsessing over them with my friends. Over time, after playing better games and watching better anime, my enthusiasm towards the series died down. When DR3 was announced, I thought maybe my interest in the series could be re-invigorated. I&#039;m not one to get &quot;hyped&quot; for anything new, but I was ready to hop on board and have a great time. Yeah, I can be optimistic. I would&#039;ve even been somewhat forgiving if the show was fun to watch.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#039;t. Did I possibly miss the sign hanging overhead that read &quot;Fun and wacky times ahead, haha!&quot; before walking through the doorway? Could I possibly hate fun? <br />
<br />
Obviously, no. You would be hard-pressed to find someone out there that doesn&#039;t love fun, and I would have been having it while watching this show if not for the fact that I don&#039;t believe that sign ever existed. I&#039;m not someone that requires all shows to appeal to my higher senses in order for me to like them. Nevertheless, I would prefer my story-driven anime such as this to be BOTH super enjoyable to watch and to make me think about it, but I can still respect the sensation of pure fun that can be elicited out of shows I would never consider putting among my favorites (Little Witch Academia is a perfect example of this). DR3 just sucks at fun. It was a chore to watch, and I honestly salvaged no enjoyment whatsoever out of anything in it. If, while watching a show, I zone out the events that are happening to think about my favorite shows, and I have to rewind because of it, then there might be a problem somewhere. Sorry, but I don&#039;t enjoy &quot;turning my brain off&quot; while watching a show.<br />
<br />
I also want to make it clear that I have never thought about why a show bothered me with such painstaking detail before. To be honest, I don&#039;t even like writing these kinds of long-form reviews because there&#039;s usually an opinion out there that echoes my own (this review was enjoyable to write, though). And, typically, I drop a show when I feel that I won&#039;t like it anyway, so I haven&#039;t had many opportunities to do this.<br />
<br />
Call me overly pessimistic for despising this show so much to give it a 1/10 (a rating I have only given to 4 other shows and always hesitate to use), but I still seriously believe Danganronpa did not deserve this. It did not deserve to get so thoroughly embarrassed by this god-awful excuse of an anime. It has no merits whatsoever, as a standalone anime or a conclusion to the series. It&#039;s not nice to look at, it has a bland soundtrack, it&#039;s unsatisfying, it&#039;s boring, it&#039;s annoying, it&#039;s stupid. <br />
<br />
I wish it didn&#039;t exist. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
....is what I would say, if I cared enough.

    If I had to describe Danganronpa 3 in one word, it would be &quot;unnecessary&quot;. That&#039;s ultimately what it all boils down to. DR3 is not a necessary part of Danganronpa canon, nor is it necessary to watch it. It&#039;s completely disposable, and altogether just pretty terrible.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s pretty hard to write an in-depth review of DR3 Future without going into heavy spoiler territory, since exactly where the story goes is a big part of why it&#039;s so disappointing, but I&#039;ll try my best. Future sets itself up as another killing game, although this time it&#039;s more akin to something found in Zero Escape than Danganronpa proper.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230378">
        It remains a murder mystery, albeit one very different to those found in DR1 and 2. The mystery&#039;s solution ends up not only being lame, but also massively predictable. The big reveal towards the end was a total non-event since I&#039;d already figured it out several episodes ago. The mastermind behind the incident is also a letdown, since it was so extensively telegraphed that it seemed almost too obvious to be true. The methods used, the characters involved, the narrative weaved between both this and DR3 Despair... everything is weak.<br />
<br />
But it&#039;s not the destination, right? If the journey is enjoyable, then the answers we get at the end don&#039;t make and break the whole series, right? Sure, but DR3 Future&#039;s journey isn&#039;t enjoyable in the slightest. Most of the episodes feel like filler, with pointless characters acting out pointless subplots that don&#039;t go anywhere, and they end up pointlessly getting killed. They could&#039;ve easily told this story in half the number of episodes with how completely unnecessary most of them are. Aside from a select few, most of the characters also only exist to get killed. Not to further the plot at all, but simply just because people will expect a lot of deaths from this series. Both new and returning characters are largely one-note, with only Kyosuke Munakata and Juzo Sakakura showing any kind of depth. None of these other people, including the DR1 survivors, are interesting at all. Even Kirigiri, one of DR1&#039;s driving forces, is reduced to a glorified extra.<br />
<br />
Production value-wise, the animation is slightly better than DR3 Despair&#039;s, though not by much. The music and voice acting however are, as always, top notch.<br />
<br />
Was DR3 Future a completely miserable experience, though? Sorta, but not quite. The most fun I had was discussing theories and just how stupid the show kept getting every week, and if you can&#039;t have that experience then I say skip DR3 entirely. Skip if if you&#039;ve played the games, absolutely skip it if you haven&#039;t played the games, just skip it. It&#039;s a waste of time.

    With the end of Danganronpa 2, fans couldn’t help but be a tad bit disappointed with its conclusion as it didn’t wrap all the problems present in the franchise. And situations were left unsolved and we needed to know more about the “Future Foundation”. With the third Danganronpa being confirmed to be part of a new universe, the despair for the fans only continued. But with the announcement of a anime sequel to the second Danganronpa game, fans regained all hope for a proper conclusion for this universe, which will leave us satisfying. Whether or not Danganronpa 3 manages to succeed in doing so will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230341">
        only be decided once Kibou-hen airs, but for now, Mirai-hen is a satisfying continuation of the Danganronpa series; one that feels home with the franchise despite its differences with the previous entries. <br />
<br />
~{Story}~<br />
Do note that this is called Danganronpa 3 for a reason. It’s meant to be watched after playing the first and second game (though you can watch the anime adaptation of the first game instead of playing it). But not doing so will make you not be aware of many plot points that are important in Danganronpa 3. Anyways, Mirai-hen continues off right from where the second game ended. Our protagonist from the first game who is now a member of the Future Foundation, Naegi Makoto, is held under suspicion for treason due to him saving the Remnants of Despair instead of killing them. Just when his punishment was being decided, Monokuma appear… again, and he announced a killing game… again. Now the members of the Future Foundation are trapped in their own headquarters, forced to play what is supposed to be the final killing game. The premise is basically similar to the previous games, but the main goal of the series is to find the traitor within the group. Overall, the story is handled well and there’s some really big twist and turns along the way. Characters that you thought had plot armor may not. But most of the series is just basically watching the “Number of People Alive” counter decreasing one by one. There isn’t a proper conclusion in this series, since that is left for Kibou-hen. And some of the revelations near the end can seem a little messy. So all we can do now is hope that the final episode is just as good as the rest of the franchise. <br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
~{Presentation}~<br />
There’s one thing you’ll notice from Mirai-hen, and that is how different it is from the first two games. First of all, gone is all the class trials from this killing game. This is more like “Battle Royale” where people have to be killed off one-by-one and the culprit won’t be judged. That also means that you won’t be hearing “sore wa chigau yo” a lot in the series. Instead of six different cases to handle, now the characters have one large case: Who is the mastermind? If anything, Mirai-hen feels a lot like Zero Escape, which isn’t a bad thing. Secondly, characters now have bracelets with NG codes on them. Each player has an NG code that gives them a restriction. If the restriction is crossed, the bracelet will inject them with lethal chemicals that will kill them. This gives the viewers a sense of mystery as you won’t be able to know what are the characters’ NG codes. But it’s fun to guess and see if you’re right! Thirdly, there are characters outside the game that get focus and you get to know what’s going on outside the game, something which you weren’t aware of in the previous games. Fourthly, humor is very rare in Mirai-hen as things are more darker here. This new tone for the series works well, especially since this is supposed to be the conclusion of this universe. Lastly, and most importantly, red blood is used instead of Danganronpa’s trademark pink blood. Unlike Zetsubou-hen, which sticks with the pink blood, Mirai-hen decided to take a darker and more mature approach to the series, and it works really well. Overall, this is a quite different take on Danganronpa, but it’s still really fun and feels like a proper sequel for the series. <br />
Presentation: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
~{Character}~<br />
Mirai-hen mainly focuses on the Future Foundation characters, which consists of most of the survivng characters from the first Danganronpa game, and new characters we get introduced in this series. The protagonist from Mirai-hen is the same as the first game, Naegi Makoto, a survivor of the first killing game, a member of the Future Foundation, and commonly known as the Ultimate Hope. The series focuses on Naegi and how he has to find out who the mastermind of the killing game is, while making sure that him and his friends survive. Accompanied by him is Asahina and Kirigiri from the first game, and many other new characters like Miratai and Munakata. A lot of the new characters are developed using Zetsubou-hen, and it works pretty well. And that’s why both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen should be watched together. Not all the new characters are likable, but that was the point. But many of the new characters do end up being really well done. Yukizome does play a big enough role in Mirai-hen, but her development from Zetsubou-hen carries on here. Munakata might seem a little irritating at first, but he ended up being one of my favorite characters from Danganronpa. Same goes for Sakakura too. Overall, the new characters end up living up to the Danganronpa name and the recurring characters are just as likable as they were in the first game… except Hagakure, ‘cause no one likes Hagakure! What? Monokuma said so!<br />
Character: 9.5/10<br />

~{Art}~, <br />
As mentioned in my review for Zetsubou-hen, the art style in that series had a more vivid look to it than the games. Mirai-hen is the complete opposite as it has a darker art style that the first two games. This might have been done because Mirai-hen itself has a darker tone compared to the rest of the franchise. Or the art style is like that to represent Mirai-hen being a story that begins with despair, contrary to how Zetsubou-hen begins with hope. But this art style works well with this series. Most of the series takes place inside the headquarters, so most of the backgrounds will be the inside of buildings. But the backgrounds are pretty well detailed and well done. And the character design for the new characters are really good and well done. The characters from the first game also look more mature due to their age growth and their new designs look great as well.<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
~{Animation}~<br />
The animations are fairly good in the series, but it isn’t anything extraordinary. However, that is to say that the animation quality is fairly consistent throughout. Generally speaking, the animation is fluid enough and there aren’t any noticeable animation quality drops. Character animations are done fairly well. Lighting is very differently that Zetsubou-hen. Everything looks bleaker and the lighting add to that. However, the animation quality is better than Zetsubou-hen’s but that should be necessary since Mirai-hen is more action-heavy than Zetsubou-hen. As mentioned before Lerche did a good job in animating two seasons during the same time, which they aren’t used too. <br />
Animation: 8/10<br />
<br />
~{Voice Acting}~<br />
The seiyuu cast is really good in Mirai-hen as most seiyuu return back to do their recurring character, and the seiyuu for the new characters are great too. One notable change is that Tarako is now the new voice of Monokuma instead of Ooyama Nobuyo. The reason so is because Ooyama is currently suffering from dementia, which is very sad to hear and hopefully she gets well soon (even if things don’t look good). Though Tarako isn’t as good as Ooyama, she does a decent job as Monokuma, though the character is barely here in Mirai-hen for an obvious reason. Ogata Megumi does a great job again as Naegi and makes him feel very similar to the first game. Hikasa Yoko does a great job with Kirigiri and Saito Chiwa does a good job with Asahina. We also get some pretty well-known people to voice act the new characters, like live-action actor Hongo Kanata as Mitarai, Morikawa Toshiyuki as Munakata, Suwabe Junichi as Sakakura, and many more. And they all do a great job in what they have to do.<br />
Voice Acting: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
~{Music}~<br />
One of Danganronpa’s strong point is its music and Mirai-hen is no different. The OP, “DEAD OR LIE”, is really good and it grew on me really fast. The vocals are good, but the music for that song is awesome. The lyrics not only matches the series, but the franchise as a whole. It might very well be one of my favorite OP of the year. The ED, “Recall THE END”, creates more of a mystery vibe and it matches well with the series. The ED gets really good near the middle, once the second verse happens. Most of the background music consists of music used in the first two games, which is a good thing since the two games had some amazing music. The background music creates a sense of nostalgia due to its familiarity. Many of the OST that you’ve heard during trials or investigations are used in Mirai-hen, and it works really well. <br />
Music: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
~{Enjoyment}~<br />
As a Danganronpa fan, I found Mirai-hen to be a very satisfying continuation of the series and I can’t wait to see how Kibou-hen wraps things up. Seeing the surviving characters of the first Danganronpa game was fun to see and the new characters in Mirai-hen are really interesting and unique. This new take on the killing game with its Zero Escape-ish style is great and it’s new, darker tone works. A lot of unpredictable things happen and it keeps me more and more invested in the series. Every time an episode ended, I would spend the rest of my time waiting for the next episode, while theorizing who can be the mastermind with the given clues I have. Despite it being an anime and not a game, I still feel like I’m using clues to solve this one big case, and that’s what I wanted as a Danganronpa fan. <br />
Enjoyment: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
In the end, Mirai-hen is a proper continuation from the ending of the second Danganronpa game. If you are a fan of the series, you should definitely check Mirai-hen out if you haven’t already. There’s a lot of things that are different in Mirai-hen when compared to the rest of the series and it has a style of its own. But it still feels part of the Danganronpa series, even with these changes. Seeing the Danganronpa 1 characters again was fun and the new characters are nice too. The plot-twists and revelations work well and keep me invested in the series. Mirai-hen doesn’t have a proper conclusion, but that is because Kibou-hen is supposed to be the conclusion for this Danganronpa universe. Hopefully the Mirai-hen arc will get rid of all the despair left in the series.<br />
<br />
+ A proper continuation of the Danganronpa series.<br />
+ Killing game is unique and its new style and tone works well for the series.<br />
+ The first game characters are back and most of the new characters are really well handled. <br />
+ Interesting cat-and-mouse story that has a good amount of plot-twist and revelations.<br />
+ Soundtrack from the first two games are used and they are effective and OP/ED are great. <br />
- Revelations near the end raises a lot of questions.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.9/10

    Note: Before watching this please play through all three Danganronpa games (1, SDR2, and Another episode). Also you should watch the future arc episode with the despair arc in broadcast order. Watch future arc ep 1 then despair arc ep 1, and so forth and so on. Watching the two series in this order is very important as Despair arc develops some of the characters from the Future arc.<br />
<br />
Danganronpa 3: Future arc is a sequel and essentially a finale to the Danganronpa series. Whereas the counterpart Despair arc is a prequel to the entire story, Future arc details the story after the Biggest, Most Awful,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230630">
        Most Tragic event in human history. It reintroduces the killing game shown in the DR series prior, except this time, in the real world, without any school rules. There are completely fresh batch of characters, some whom we eventually see fall.<br />
<br />
Future arc centers around the main survivors of the events in DR1, along with the division leaders of the Future Foundation. The leaders themeselves had thought that they already caught the traitor, but little did they know they had already fallen into the real traitor&#039;s trap. To make the matters worse, this time the killings don&#039;t end in a class trial as it did in previous games. Instead, they have to find the traitor and kill him to end it once and for all. <br />
The story is basically kill or be killed. Unlike Despair arc which starts off with a more light hearted tone that constantly evolves into a more brooding tone, Future arc starts off with a darker tone straight of the bat. The first couple of seconds of ep 1 essentially shows how the world has become since the Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic event in human history. And throughout, the episodes are just constantly filled with tension as the characters try to somehow find a way to survive.<br />
Future arc also manages to weave in characters from all three Danganronpa series. Whether it is a whole episode dedicated to them or if it&#039;s just a couple of moments, it is still fun to watch the rest of the other game&#039;s cast after their events.<br />
A problem with this kind of a setting though is the pacing, which was noticeable in Future arc. One episode could be filled with new events while the next could be slightly disappointing and rushed. However, the still lingering mysteries about the traitor and the NG codes (the only &quot;rules&quot; in the killing game) kept me hooked throughout. One huge disappointment was the plot twists regarding the DR 1 characters. At first I thought, &quot;this is really happening,&quot; but then after a couple of episodes and even in the Hope arc, the plot twist got ruined by playing it safe. <br />
<br />
The animation is great and the action scenes are fun to watch. The art itself was also a good point from Future arc. Like the tone, the color schemes of Future arc constantly stays on the darker color, unlike Despair arc which slowly transitions from lighter to darker. Also to emphasize the impact of the killing game, the staff even decided to change the blood from pink to red. At first, I didn&#039;t know how to feel about this as the pink blood was a unique part of the danganronpa series, but it was understandable considering this was the finale and they had to really highlight the brutality of the final killing game.<br />
One interesting aspect, like I mentioned, is that Despair arc events has great meaning in the Future arc. Knowing what happens in Despair arc comes in handy for the Future arc.<br />
<br />
The opening song is great and the soundtracks are decent. However, being a guy who really pays attention to the OSTs, the ones in Future arc were slightly underwhelming. There is also an awesome cast of new voice actors who did great, alongside the voices we were already accustomed to.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the most important part of Danganronpa series are its characters. When I was going through each DR series for the first time, I always wondered if I would get attached to the characters. The same was for the Future arc. Unfortunately, It&#039;s safe to say I like some of the characters, but not more than I wanted to. Maybe because the anime was just a 12 episode series and not an entire Visual novel, but it was harder for me to get attached to the characters. Some of them died too quickly, granted it was to showcase the brutality of the killing game but still. Some of them started out just plain annoying, although one certain character did get more fleshed out than the most.  In the latter episodes, a lot more characters get fleshed out a bit more, which was nice to see. . We got backgrounds and more personalities: whether interesting or annoying. However, it was still minimal, so I honestly did not care for most of them. One of the characters got more depth than most of any other characters in other DR series even. Anyways, although the new characters do show interesting traits and personalities, it was rather hard to get attached to most of them quickly. It was only after a couple more episodes that I got somewhat attached to more characters.<br />
After 11 episodes, I have to say that the developments of some characters are pretty awesome to see. For example (SPOILER: Juzo), was one character I thought I would never like, but in the end he became the most developed and also became my favorite from the new cast. <br />
As for the original DR1 cast, they were pretty much the same. Kyouko being the smart detective trying to find out the traitor, Hagakure being Hagakure, and Naegi being that typical &quot;not let anyone die&quot; MC. One thing I liked from the original cast was Asahina, whom you could clearly see matured and developed after the killing game in DR1.<br />
<br />
Although their are clear flaws in both pacing and early characterization wise, Future arc still is a pretty decent watch. As with the DR games, it is always so stressful for the new episode to come out because you don&#039;t know who might die. The mystery of the traitor is not obvious and make you think of all the possibilities. One of the biggest downsides, however, is the underwhelming ending.  Character wise, although it startes out in a weak manner, gets better as episodes progress, though it is heavily limited. Although both Despair arc and Future arc are disappointing in many aspects, both are still a decent watch for dangaronpa fans.

    Third time&#039;s the charm.<br />
<br />
Here it is, a third killing game. Monokuma managed to pull it off for the third time now, this time with 12 new characters in the killing game along with Naegi, Kirigiri and Hina. I was a little skeptic about this part after episode 3 but I&#039;m glad it delivered near the end, as Danganronpa always does. This entry will launch off with a brand new killing game and it will be the (near) conclusion to the entire Danganronpa franchise of the Hopes Peak Academy era. We await the conclusion with Side:Hope.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re interested in watching this, you have to go back

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230369">
        to the start of this series as this is the third entry from this series and watching this without knowledge of prior entries will confuse you and you wont get the full enjoyment out of this entry, not to mention it will also spoil the events of SDR1 and 2. If you have knowledge then the watch order would be episode 1 of Side:Future, then episode 1 of Side:Despair and continue that pattern with the finale being Side:Hope. Remember, this review will contain minor and major spoilers of SDR1 and 2 and also very minor spoilers of SDR3, you have been warned.<br />
<br />
The story starts off almost right after the events of SDR2, Naegi&#039;s &quot;betrayal&quot; by siding with the Remnants of Despair. Que all the leading members of the Future Foundation along with some of the cast of SDR1 and boom, you have your brand new killing game, quite exciting isn&#039;t it? Here there is a new concept called NG codes - With NG codes, every participant has an action they can&#039;t do and the bangles are stuck on their wrists, if they end up doing said action then they get infected with poison, a neat concept for Danganronpa and it spices up this killing game. Also, every 2 hours they get infected with sleeping gas, then the traitor/killer wakes up and kills someone, if the traitor/killer kills someone then the game goes on, if no one dies then everyone wins the game. There is no class trials in this one. It&#039;s a rather slow start, but it later picks up and it gets very interesting, overall I thought it was a well written story, with plot twists, cliffhangers leaving you wanting more and overall nice direction, unfortunately we were left not with a conclusion yet as there will be one more episode in Side:Hope, therefore the last episode doesn&#039;t feel as satisfactory as it could have been.<br />

Story - 9<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ah, the characters, do they live up to the amazing casts of SDR1 and SDR2? No, unfortunately they don&#039;t, but wait, that doesn&#039;t mean they were bad at all. There were 12 brand new characters introduced to us, all of them were former Hopes Peak Academy students or staff. Two of the characters weren&#039;t really developed at all and felt very flat. Other two characters didn&#039;t feel interesting enough even though they were developed, they even got lots of screen time in the beginning so I was thoroughly disappointed in the begin. I&#039;m glad they did get development though, otherwise it would&#039;ve been bad. All the other 8 characters were fair game and I really enjoyed seeing the Vice-President in this anime, a great character to come out of this one. Thanks to Side:Despair we got to learn more about most of these characters too, which was nice.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Characters: 8<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The art, just like Side:Despair, wasn&#039;t anything amazing. They did a few animation faults too, like covering what was supposed to be a hallway with a wall, constant changes in the characters positions after they wake up from the sleeping gas compared to how they were when they fell asleep. It wasn&#039;t necessarily bad, but I found it quite disappointing, but I guess it&#039;s understandable with how much work the animators are probably doing at the same time - Side:Future, Side:Despair and SDRV3 - still doesn&#039;t excuse it though.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Art &amp; Animation: 6<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Naturally, the sound is amazing. With new voice actors, they all did wonderful. Danganronpa never fails to amaze me when it comes to selecting the voice actors. The soundtrack is really good too. I have no issues with the sound at all.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Sound: 10<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Except for the rather boring start, this was a blast to me, I really enjoyed seeing the returning characters again and I loved the direction of the story, A great sequel to SDR2 I might say, hopefully the conclusion to the series wont be bad, that would just be fairly disappointing after all the fun I&#039;ve had with both sides.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
While this show does have a few faults, I still think it was really good, a great anime that I recommend to any fan of the Danganronpa franchise, it&#039;s a must watch and I&#039;ll remember this one for a while just like the previous entries in this franchise.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Overall: 9<br />

    Danganronpa 3 for me is a very risky move for me especially due to the fact that it&#039;s a 12 episode anime and we know how that turned out to be last time. I reviewed Danganronpa 3 Despair arc and as I said it is a really broken anime.However, Future arc was really well constructed and was much better than despair arc, but it&#039;s still not the best thing i could have imagined. Im pretty sure hope arc will wrap things in a great way, otherwise This whole show would go to waste. So let&#039;s take a closer look about the anime that follows the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230362">
        events of the NWP.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
This anime no longer adapts the bright and energetic colors from the past entries. They decided to go really dark with this anime, even the blood is red now. I have to say that is a very daring decision to tamper with an art style that was iconic for danganronpa but honestly...I LOVED THIS CHANGE. It really works, you see mirai hen is supposed to be a concluding anime and it must have a really strong vibe in it that makes feel as if this anime is the beginning of the end, and thats how the new art style helped in this anime. The gory looked really disturbing and I loved that. It gives a more eerie vibe to the situation. Ofcourse the anime has the same issue as despair hen where i feel the character design lack details in some scenes,however in this anime it&#039;s very small. I wont say the art here is perfect but it definitely was amazing, really great great decision to go more darker<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
As I mentioned before in the despair arc review, both animes of Danganronpa 3 recycle some old tracks with some new additions. While Despair arc felt lazy in its approach, future arc really did it right. There is simply not a single soundtrack in this anime that didn&#039;t make me feel uneasy. It&#039;s perfect, and the new additions in future arc were really great. I enjoyed both the recycled tracks and the new ones, not to mention both the op and the ed were MAGNIFICENT!!! Great job on the soundtrack, really eerie, mysterious, and really has the finale vibe in it<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
OK the story was good, but not a danganronpa level good. I felt like they have held back a little bit in this anime in terms of twist just to focus more on the theme of hope. the story is reeeeeeeaaallly slow paced here, but they use the same danganronpa formula here in which they give a slow story while throwing some cliffhangers and interesting plot points here and there to keep you moving until the end. I was kind of disappointed to see how certain twists in the story were not that shocking in this anime. I felt like this moments could&#039;ve worked better if it was a video game, because the execution of these twist felt very how do you say relaxed rather than tense. I think that it is kind of hard for them to pull of a strong twist in anime because it&#039;s not the same as doing it in a video game. It was a shame also that story had to rely on despair arc to reveal some of the new character&#039;s past. Well the idea itself is not bad actually. The problem is this idea made despair so broken and incoherent because they had to fit a lot of stuff there that damaged the quality of despair arc. There is also a certain death scene in the anime that I was confused how it really lacked some impact on it, again you can tell that they struggled here in showing strong plot points here because of the restrictions of making a 12 episode anime. I did feel sad for that death but the execution of that death scene itself felt very relaxed and not dramatic enough. There is also an episode that pissed me the hell of in this anime where they dedicated an entire episode to showing the aftermath of ultra despair girls. Now I didn&#039;t play that game but ive seen walkthroughs and I know the story and honestly I did not like it. The episode was veery boring and did not add ANYTHING interesting to the story except for a bummer and a potential spoiler, hell I dont even expect those who liked ultra despair girls to appreciate that episode. It killed the pace. Now The best thing about the story of mirai hen is how they tackled the the themes of hope. Honestly, it was perfectly executed. I won&#039;t talk in details here to avoid              spoilers, but the way tackled hope in this anime was more mature and much better than the past entries. Also, every moment with new characters especially munakata was really great, except for juzo. Overall the story is good with really strong approach to its themes but lacking a little bit in twists.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
Mirai hen did FANTASTIC job with developing it&#039;s characters especially the new ones. Well don&#039;t expect much of development from the original cast but I gotta tell you: you will LOVE the new characters. Munakata, Chisa, Sakakura, Tengan, Mitarai, and Kizakura were definitely Great!!! Munakata was my favorite. His Ideals, his idea of hope, his determination, his past and how it changed all together made Munakata a really enthralling character. Not to mention the relationship between the trio Munakata, Sakakura, and Chisa was very deep and well constructed. Ofcourse most of this development was aided by the despair arc which is really good except that as i mentioned before it puts a lot of burden on despair arc. I think to conclude my thoughts about Tengan and Ryota, I have to watch Hope arc first and thats why i am not gonna talk about them here. Overall, the anime did great in its delivery on presenting its character except for the main danganronpa which was a bummer but understandable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10<br />
From the first episode of this anime, The tension and expectations never dries away. The plot for me was disappointing at times and then at other times it just captures me again. two things kind of killed my enjoyment here. First of all, the excess of action scenes here. It was okay at the beginning, it makes you feel the tension but later on...I think the anime changed to BlazBlue. The action scenes were really bothersome to watch, yeah the animation was descent but  this is not danganronpa anymore. you see these action scenes start to kill all the mysterious vibes and thrills of the anime, it feels really childish, they should have focused more on making a good mystery adventure rather than stupid and annoying action scenes. the other thing that annoyed is that ultra despair girls episode.....YES ITS THAT ANNOYING. Around the end of the anime, everything becomes just right, just the way you wanted it to be and the way it should have been from the beginning, continuous mystery solving and character tension without overuse of actions is what this anime should have done. As a whole, the anime is really entertaining and keeps you guessing while annoying you with stupid action scenes here and there<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Yes Mirai hen wasn&#039;t disappointing at all.It is a really good anime, but you can see that spike chunsoft didn&#039;t do their best here, I think they should,ve just focused on making a game even if they don&#039;t want the same killing game to be repeated a third time. Im just guessing they didn&#039;t know how to do it with a game and so they decided to make an anime. The final piece remaining is the hope arc which will determine for sure whether this anime is a masterpiece or a failed conclusion. I put my trust in spike chunsoft

    (If you are looking for a complex story, (more) killing games, gore, and some serious plot twists then this is for you. I recommend you read through a synopsis of the other parts of the series or you may be confused on some of the things they mention. You should watch Zetsobou-hen alongside it for some background info.)<br />
<br />
I like Dangan Ronpa 3 because it wrapped everything up into a nice present.<br />
<br />
I like Dangan Ronpa 3 because it is split up into two parts (soon three) to not condense any info.<br />
<br />
If you have been really into the series, you will be satisfied to know a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230333">
        of things are covered especially regarding Chiaki and the Remnants of Despair. You also get to see Junko Enoshima behind the scenes as she works her plan to bring the world into despair!<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
STORY: The story is great. As I said, it wraps everything up and makes everything clear. If you watched it as it broadcasts, you hungered for new episodes as the cliffhangers were appropriately placed. Of course, a lot of people will be dying and a character you may not expect. A certain cliff hanger in episode 11 is unexpected, but it&#039;s never anything I was expecting.<br />
<br />
ART: The art is very good. The art is not the best, but it&#039;s not the worse I have seen (ex. Asako Get You!). The shading is really nice. They have improved certain animation aspects such as gore (mostly in Zetsobou-hen).<br />
<br />
SOUND: The sound is outstanding. I rate sound by how memorable it was. There are some reuse of songs from the game, but they are remastered(?). The opening to Zetsobou-hen is my favorite versus this OP, it&#039;s calm despite what would later happen..<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: The character design is good. I don&#039;t really like many of the new characters, but they aren&#039;t bad or bland.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: I really, really, really, enjoyed this installment. It&#039;s sad to see it end (?) and I cannot wait for the finale. I am really hyped and you will be to even if you simply started watching right now.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s all. Don&#039;t give in to DESPAIR!<br />
<br />

    Tldr, bad writing, unlikable characters, and animation errors make this a truely unenjoyable experience from start to finish, with EXTRA bad parts thrown in for good measure.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve played every Danganronpa game, and read every story and relevant side plot.<br />
<br />
Starting from the first moments of this anime you&#039;ll notice a surprising lack of budget. The art is barely passable for a series of this size, the sound direction is forgettable at best, and the writing is awful. The character&#039;s are where danganronpa has always shined, but don&#039;t expect them to save the story this time. They are completely unlikable, and have no real set motivations or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231061">
        goals. The only time you&#039;ll learn anything new, interesting, or plot relevant about a character is in flashbacks seconds before they die.<br />
<br />
Skipping the art and sound, which are both merely low budget, we&#039;ll talk about the writing and story. As mentioned, the new characters have no real set motivations or personalities. They exist merely to bump heads with characters you know from DR1, and have no lives beyond that. You never get the feeling one of these characters will be missed by someone, you never get the feeling that they were someones loved one or partner, these characters ONLY exist in the vacuum of this anime plot to chase Naegi and Aoi around for 20 minutes an episode.  This may lead you to believe that Naegi and Aoi are central figures to the plot, that they are relevantly unraveling the mysteries and being developed as characters. You&#039;d be wrong though. They have nearly no plot relevance, they are only there along with the rest of the living Dr1 cast to pretend to die at the end of episodes so viewers will watch the next episode. It never sticks though, and some of the fakeouts get pretty insulting by the end of it. Episode seven in particular is just filler, and can be completely skipped. Episode 9 is when the anime really hits it&#039;s lowest points however. Everything after episode 9 will leave you scratching your head, wondering why this anime was made in the first place. The anime ends where it starts, a status quo were nearly nothing new has been introduced to the DR canon, and the UTMOST &quot;Care&quot; was taken to make sure that NOTHING about the old characters has changed in any way.<br />
<br />
On pure enjoyment factor alone, I&#039;d recommend fans of the games, and fans of anime in any form to avoid this series. Scenes will drive you crazy with constant continuity errors, animation errors, and forgotten plot threads.  The premise is stupid, and is never justified. Unlikable characters are made up on the spot just to die. Deathflags are so obvious that you&#039;ll never be surprised or caught off guard. Characters walk on screen and announce their time to die, then die, and none of the other characters really seem to care. Several times characters are found dead, or murdered directly in front of everyone, and nobody bats an eye or cares.  Ends on Status Quo restoration,  the entire anime can be removed without losing anything from the series. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll finish this review on a somewhat positive note. The characters Ruruka and Seiko have their own subplot that spans for almost the entire series filling up whatever time isn&#039;t taken by Naegi and Aoi doing basically nothing. The sub plot has some obvious flaws but is interesting and keeps the episodes moving, and these two characters actually end up being developed because of it, you may accidentally end up even caring for them.  However just as their character arcs come to a close the story reminds you how stupid you were for liking any of the new characters. Then replaces them with even more Aoi and naegi, just running around and not really accomplishing anything.<br />

    It&#039;s been three years since I looked at the first Danganronpa anime. While it wasn&#039;t one of the best anime I&#039;ve seen, I did rather like it. Now we&#039;re skipping ahead to Danganronpa 3, because there wasn&#039;t a Danganronpa 2 anime. Maybe  they thought the game wouldn&#039;t translate well. Maybe they didn&#039;t consider it good enough. Maybe they got distracted reading Voyages of the Cerberus and missed their window of opportunity. The first two are more likely by far but a man can daydream. The odd thing about Danganronpa 3 is that it&#039;s split into two settings, both of which were running at roughly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231677">
        the same time. This week, we&#039;ll be looking at the Mirai-hen &amp; Kibou-hen setting this week. Although I may take a look at the Zetsubou-hen setting later this month. So, let&#039;s take a look and see how it holds up compared to the first series. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open with our protagonist from the first series, Naegi Makoto, being taken to the headquarters of the Future Foundation to answer charges of being a traitor. Supposedly, he safeguarded a bunch of remnants of despair. Maybe that&#039;s what happened in the second game. While attending the meeting with all the foundation&#039;s higher ups, along with Kirigiri  &amp; Asahina, the building gets attacked. They wake up to a Monokuma video telling them that they&#039;ve been brought into a game of despair. He claims that one of them is a traitor and, in order to end the game, they have to either kill the traitor or wake up with all of them alive. To put them to sleep at regular intervals, they&#039;re also given wristbands that inject them with sleeping drugs after a set amount of time. The wristbands are also programmed with forbidden actions. Should any of them do their forbidden action, they&#039;ll be injected with a lethal amount of poison. Naturally, Naegi is instantly viewed as the most suspicious by several people. Can he survive their attacks and solve the mystery around him?<br />
<br />
There are two major flaws with the series. The first is that it spends a lot of time following the characters who are outside of the game. A lot of the stuff they do is really over the top action fare and it hugely undermines any suspense or horror atmosphere that&#039;s happening on the inside. Not only that, but the events on the outside don&#039;t do that much. They reveal some information that the audience could have gotten from the characters on the inside and it would have worked better. The other big problem with the series are the speeches. In the first Danganronpa anime, the ending had a big speech and it was cheesy and kind of stupid, but it didn&#039;t hurt the series over-much since the bulk of it focused on the mysteries, which were pretty solid. In this series, there are a lot of really cheesy speeches about hope and despair. A lot of the discussion is less about the mystery and more about hope. These are speeches that could kind of work, if they were in a Precure series or something else for small children, but that are really absurd and ridiculous in this context. By the way, the Kibou-hen special is mostly cheesy speeches to wrap everything up and the series retconning what could have been a strong tragic moment thereby ruining it.<br />
<br />
That being said, this was a solid premise. The idea of all these characters being trapped in a claustrophobic setting and uncertain of who they can trust is a compelling one. If they&#039;d focused more on that facet and less on over the top action and speeches, this series could have been really good. I also do like the ultimate reveal. The twist is also genuinely clever. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
In the first series, the characters were largely kind of shallow archetypes, but passable for what the series was doing. In this one, not so much. While the characters are still shallow, they&#039;re also a bit annoying. Particularly Naegi and Munakata with their long speeches. We get it, you guys have a serious hope fetish, leave it in the bedroom. The only character who gets to keep their dignity is Kirigiri. She&#039;s the only character who actually seems interested in solving the mystery. The rest spend their time chasing after each other, hiding, or following her lead. <br />
<br />
On the outside, we have our action squad, Naegi&#039;s sister &amp; Touko from the first series doing the bulk of it. We also have Tagami who gives some exposition and orders people around. We also get to see Hagakure hang about outside the Future Foundation building being completely ineffectual. I seriously have no idea why he&#039;s here. He contributes nothing to the story. They just cut to him doing random things on occasion. In one scene he&#039;s fortune telling. In another he&#039;s fishing and, in another he&#039;s fleeing a helicopter. None of which affects the plot in the slightest. You could seriously replace him with a black Labrador and nothing would change. Except that the Labrador wouldn&#039;t be as annoying and would be cute. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve mentioned the overblown action scenes already. They aren&#039;t good. The absurd, overblown character designs continue to be a weakness for the series. I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s distracting when your horror mystery has characters who look like they should be challenging children to a trading card game in order to steal Egyptian artefacts. The unique, game aesthetic the first game had with its visual style aren&#039;t present in this one. Which is kind of a shame since those did give the series a unique identity. Which is something this one could use. We&#039;ve got dark visuals mixed with goofy character designs. Neither of which is really unique. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Hikasa Yoko is really good in this. I&#039;ll also give credit to Ogata Megumi, in spite of Naegi&#039;s annoying qualities, she does give a strong performance as him. Saito Chiwa and Ishida Akira are also quite good. As are Suwabe Junichi &amp; Morikawa Toshiyuki. Most of these performances, in all fairness, are perfectly passable. There are a few exceptions. Minase Inori doesn&#039;t do well when her character gets in any kind of emotional moment. Neither does Eguchi Takuya. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the direction or just that they aren&#039;t good at serious moments. I&#039;ve heard them both give strong performances in comedic works, but never in anything serious. Hirano Aya&#039;s character is just an annoyance. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a  bit. Naegi&#039;s sister and Touko seem to get really close in their scenes together. Which culminates in a really homo-erotic speech from the sister while they&#039;re clinging to a rocket. Although, it does seem to be one-sided with all indications being that Touko still has a thing for Tagami. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
This was a series with a promising premise. Unfortunately, it&#039;s held back by a lacklustre execution that largely fails to take advantage of it. Instead, we&#039;re given cheesy hope speeches, ridiculous action scenes and characters who mostly can&#039;t be bothered with the mystery. In the end, it&#039;s a weak follow up. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. Next week I&#039;ll continue horror anime month with a look at 91 Days.

    So, Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen ends, what used to be a game, ends, so what can I say about this sequel??????????<br />
<br />
Storywise, I gave it an outstanding 10 over 10, since the genre really did played out, as indicated, the plot was basically a hope vs despair theme as the first &quot;Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation&quot; ( don&#039;t include the prequel pls). And just like the frist sequel the story also played us audience as well, where one might think that the anime was more of a repeat of the first sequel , but was not........it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230563">
        really almost fooled us, kudos to the creator:  Spike Chunsoft, whoever he or she is. FU, FU, FU, FU!<br />
<br />
Art, well I don&#039;t have much to say about it since the only thing that have change was the character&#039;s attire, I&#039;m referring to Kirigiri, Aoi and Negai, the rest......well, except for Munakata, Tenga, Juzo and  Chisa, who all wore the appropriate  attires, were just too damned silly, and I can never understand as what up with Seiko wearing a dorky surgical mask, Miaya, being in a wheelchair, even thought she&#039;s an android, and,Gozu with that bull mask. However I&#039;m giving a 6 over 10 for Komaru&#039;s fanservice, FU, FU, FU, FUUUU!!!!<br />
<br />
Sound, it&#039;s a 5 over 10, since the seiyuu&#039;s who did the character&#039;s voice were still the same.....for the major character&#039;s that is. FU, FU, FU, FUUUU!!!!!<br />
<br />
Character, ok, this is the part were a mensa member would wanna give the original creator  Spike Chunsoft and director Kishi, Seiji a lotta lambasting for insulting talented people for using the term &quot;super level&quot;, in fact they would see that the character&#039;s represent the kind of foolishness of not being able to tell apart as to what is , talent, virtue, slot, vanity, oddity and the  bizarre, so let&#039;s group them:<br />
<br />
Negai Makoto and Junko Enoshima: one is a specified as a Super High School Level Luck/ hope and the other is  Super High School Level Fashion Girl/ despair/ psychopath weren&#039;t to be consider as such since their other title despair and hope are virtues not talent, also Junko is a loca, so she should be having the title super level psychopath. Negai, being this super level luck. should just be consider as &quot;The Protagonist&quot; without any of the super level bullshit.<br />
<br />
 Bandai, Daisaku and Yasuhiro Hagakure, whatever super level bullshit they are, are just a bunch of super level dorksters with no function at all........I can&#039;t say the same in the videogames, since I don&#039;t have such luxury of having it.<br />
<br />
Munakata Kyouske and Juzo Sakakura, were nothing more than a bunch of super level bullies, whom themselves were against the others and eventually begun being against with each other.<br />
<br />
Kizakura, Kouichi and Tenga Kazu, were just a couple of old geezers, that were meant for retirement....to their grave.<br />
<br />
Izayoi Sonosuke and Andou Ruruka, one is a treacherous manipulative bitch and the other is a protective ass, who is just as stupid for allowing himself to be killed by his manipulative bitch. <br />
<br />
Yukizome, Chisa, MItarai and Seiko Kimura , I meant, really, these guys are super level at something one is a super level pharmacist and the other is a super level Housekeeper? Can it get more odd than this , since both of them were super level suckers? And that&#039;s what they are. Seiko Kimura would ask as to where did her friendship with Andou went wrong? Well, it went wrong the moment she met her, dang stupid character. Yukizone as aSuper Level House keeper???????Man, I can do the same jobs as she does, and really, a mensa member has all the right to criticize the creator, Spike Chunsoft . Mitarai....is pretty much a super level pussy.<br />
<br />
And lest&#039;s not forget Komaru and Toko, can be considers as the ultimate lesbian lovers. The rest like  Kirigiri, Aoi, Gekokgahara and Monaca and Gozu, were the protagonist&#039;s support, I also give this category a low score since they killed off Kirigiri instead of the ultimate bimbo Aoi. Kirigiri has more substance than Aoi, so why should she be killed off , that is the question. And I hate that she&#039;s being killed off. So the character assignment was just soo poor and it&#039;s a 3 over 10, FU, FU, FU! Btw, nice to see Togami again.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, well it was a good 7 over 10, since it was enjoyable, but not that good cu&#039;z why???????????Oh yeah , cu&#039;z they killed off Kirigiri and this anime was left with an open ending for the other sequel...the hope arc that is.<br />
<br />
So overall it&#039;s a fair 6, on to the hope arc.......<br />
<br />
<br />
Fu, Fu, Fu........<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m going to kind of melt in Future and Despair side, as they are intended to be watched at the same time, but I&#039;m mostly directing my attention to Future.<br />
<br />
I used to be a big Danganronpa fan. I got the VITA for the sole purpose of playing the games, when SDR2 was only getting translated by some random people on the internet and the first game had just gotten localized. I&#039;ve spent a lot of my time on Danganronpa, analyzing it, doing fanarts, discussing theories with other people, reading the fan-translated novels, playing Ultra Despair Girls, and although it had some flaws, I really the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230555">
        Danganronpa series overall.<br />
<br />
But when I knew that they announced an anime, I just had this bad feeling. Danganronpa: The Animation wasn&#039;t really good, as the quantity of episodes was just not enough for the hole plot and it tried to fit like 20+ hours of gameplay in 13 episodes of approximately 25 minutes. 20+ of gameplay, details, plot, characters, into less than 6 hours approximately of an animation. And obviously, the adaptation wasn&#039;t really the best. But I thought, &quot;Hey, they won&#039;t make the same mistake twice. Besides, two arcs? That&#039;s a total of 24 episodes, so maybe it will be different!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, how wrong I was.<br />
<br />
Both despair and future side just tried to throw in a bowl and mix a lot of characters, random plot ideas, deaths with no meaning, and terrible death flags that screamed &quot;hey lol i&#039;m gonna die now&quot;. One of the major things about Danganronpa that I liked was how ridiculous, yet interesting the plot twists were. Even if you expected some of them, it was interesting to see how the dots connected, the contradictions, the solutions, and the characters going through that trip to the truth. And sometimes the twist would make you go &quot;holy shit&quot;, because you didn&#039;t really get to see them coming.<br />
<br />
Danganronpa 3 didn&#039;t include any of those. Instead, the supposedly &quot;plot twists&quot; were so predictable, they basically screamed to your face &quot;enjoy this characters because we are going to kill it&quot;. All the raising of death flags was painful to see, it felt like watching a Blue&#039;s Clues episode of how obvious everything was. A lot of cheap and mediocre tactics to get the ratings up, including unnecessary weird fanservice (although I kind of can let that pass because almost all animes do that), fake deaths of loved characters to keep the &quot;cliffhanger up&quot;, and most of the &quot;cliffhangesr&quot; were basically thrown out to hell next episodes as they killed the hype.<br />
<br />
The new cast was basically introduced to just fill the background. There was almost no major development except for a few things, but most of them were just to basically boost up the stage for survivors of DR1, specially Naegi, who doesn&#039;t really change a lot and gets very repetitive. And there was almost no development on characters, mostly just good designs but empty shells. They just tried to throw plot ideas that ended up contradicting the canon stuff, forgot about some of the novels, and a lot of other pointless stuff. And the ending was literally out of Danganronpa&#039;s character. No bittersweet, no guilt, no sadness to see. Only a rainbow colored happy world, contradicting so much stuff, done for only fanservice and to end the &quot;kibougamine arc&quot; (which will be probably be brought back again anyways, as there&#039;s even an OVA coming with the new game).<br />
<br />
The anime just killed the essence of Danganronpa itself. No surprises, no cliffhangers, no plot twists, no character development. Just a terrible ripoff of Dora the Explorer with murder and some crappy hope vs despair plot.

    LA is gonna change up the format for this review as well as Zetsubou-hen by making it a sorta of 3-parter due to the nature of how Danganronpa 3&#039;s animes were presented so if you wanted to see LA&#039;s take on Zetsubou-hen and Kibou-hen then this review won&#039;t be in it.<br />
<br />
Before LA talks about Zetsubou-hen, LA will say that both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen anime are something of a companion piece with each other giving off clues or events that transpired that lead it to how or when it happened. The obvious companion piece both these anime have is &quot;trying to find the traitor&quot; and why

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230353">
        some of the founders are butting heads with each other in Mirai-hen and &quot;how Danganronpa&#039;s franchise started&quot; as well as some backstory on some of the newer characters in Mirai-hen for Zetsubou-hen and both arcs gives and feeds information to each other. For anime-episode order, you should/MUST watch by starting with Mirai-hen&#039;s episode then Zetsubou-hen episode then back and forth after that for &quot;clarity&quot;. Once both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen have finished finishing with Mirai-hen&#039;s final episode go to Kibou-hen for the finale<br />
<br />
With that out of the way<br />
<br />
Mirai-hen&#039;s &quot;ultimate death game&quot; by in large vastly different from the the original series&#039; one, where there are NO trials, as well as forbidden actions you&#039;ll not allowed to do in the death game otherwise you&#039;ll die instantly and having the find the traitor within the Future Foundation, before the traitor picks hope out one by one, if not the Future Foundation are already going after each other already due to the previous backstories and lingering grudges that the newer characters has. (See Zetsubou-hen review). This as a precedent makes the game far more complicated and all the more bloody with clash of beliefs of the same thing, just differing ways in which the Future Foundation members especially Kyousuke Munakata voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa.<br />
<br />
Due to the nature of the death game, it&#039;s expected that some of the Future Foundation members&#039; screentime is rather limited from the Great Gozu voiced by Kenta Miyake and Daisaku Bandai voiced by Rie Kugimiya being more obvious ones, the only exception to this is Chisa Yukizome voiced by Mai Nakahara as her backstory goes full circle in Zetsubou-hen. Aside the from that, many of the other Future Foundation members do get some form of development such as the quarreling between Ruruka Andou voiced by Inori Minase and Seiko Kimura voiced by Saki Fujita with Sounosuke Izayoi voiced by Takuya Eguchi in the crossfire of it as well as Kazuo Tengan voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata the chairman of the Future Foundation believing in Makoto. With that, the rest of the Future Foundation (omitting the characters from the original like Kyouko and Aoi) all have their backstory in Zetsubou-hen. If there was much to say about the focus of the character development, it squarely likes to focus on the more immediate (as well as important least developed) characters and &quot;dispose&quot; of them once their done, just hopefully you&#039;ve got invested in right characters before their untimely deaths because Mirai-hen does not care who dies here...very much like the death game itself. BUT just because character die doesn&#039;t mean that&#039;s it as sure they might have their time in Zetsubou-hen (maybe), BUT...this is Danganronpa after all...really what LA is trying to say is, even in this death game even beware of those who are already dead.<br />
<br />
For what this ultimate death game gave LA, was a sense of paranoia to the point LA was both analyzing and being paranoia as to who&#039;s gonna die next as well as finding out who the &quot;pawn&quot; (if there even is one!), &quot;traitor&quot; (who&#039;s killing the future Foundation members) and &quot;mastermind&quot; (Junko died TWICE right...so who&#039;s controlling this Monokuma?) are in this complicated personal grudges and hope vs. hope death game and Mirai-hen is chock to the brim with red herring deaths or unexpected ones...it keeps you on your toes to the point your being suspicious of characters who might already be dead, yes even LA was suspicious of even the dead characters especially of Chisa considering she has a bigger role in Zetsubou-hen. If there was something that Mirai-hen did right was to bring in the atmosphere of despair and paranoia. Despair from the unexpected deaths, paranoia from who&#039;s gonna die next and speculating who the mastermind, traitor and pawn are.<br />
<br />
Which will also bring up the unexpected plot twists concerning the ultimate death game, from the characters who will die PERMANENTLY to who the mastermind, traitor and pawns are and this is where the paranoia and despair ramps up the tension even further ohh and add in the expected unexpected red herrings and this death game has no mercy on their characters and none our your speculations. Another words...the plot twists are both amazing, confusing and paranoid-levels of &quot;HOW IN THE HELL WHY!??!?!?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ohh right...favourite character?...LA had two. Chisa Yukizome and Kyouko Kirigiri.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation done once again by Lerche like from the original series, Lerche brought out the dull gray tones depicting rather bleak tones right for the death game and guess what those pink blood are GONE in Mirai-hen showing red blood this time, so it&#039;s telling their serious for this one. The color palette aside from the colorful cast are green and red tinge to gray and black backgrounds (this is considering the setting is in a massive tower...the color palette is acceptable). The action scenes were pretty decent overall going from decent tactical battles to wholesale crazy ones. Where the animation kind of went down was that it for the most part has more &quot;talking than battles&quot;...ironic since it is a death game, but the atmosphere and mood of the anime was a helpful disguise to mask it and really did it quite well so LA won&#039;t criticize it too much because of it.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, well we got an exceptional list of voice actors here and listing them would take soo long, overall LA would just say that the voice acting was top notch with some special mention to Aya Hirano as Monaka Touwa, Toshiyuki Morikawa as Munakata and probably the best playing against the type role of Saki Fujita as the mad chemist Seiko. Ohh right LA forgot about the change up in voice actors for Monokuma, due to Nobuyo Ooyama&#039;s dementia, they had gotten Tarako for Mirai-hen and really...Tarako did an ok job as Monokuma, LA couldn&#039;t say much about Monokuma considering that Monokuma HARDLY appears in Mirai-hen, nonetheless Tarako was &quot;ok&quot; for the most part as Monokuma. If LA had to really pick best voice actor in Mirai-hen...it goes to Toshiyuki Morikawa...without a doubt.<br />
<br />
The ending if anything brought about a rather anti-climax, but will be hopefully taken up by Kibou-hen. But for Mirai-hen&#039;s ending, yes the &quot;mastermind&quot; was found out as well as the &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;pawns&quot; in this death game, in terms of themes, it&#039;s kinda ironic how it leads, pitting despair and hope together, where throughout the anime despair formed into hope, but by the end, it seems that hope will morph into despair, there is ALWAYS despair and hope, one can&#039;t live without the other and eliminating either of them will cause unintentional or intentional chaos. If anything even when LA found out who the culprit was and a meta-textual Junko and Chisa outright how the events of Mirai-hen occurred to make all this happen...LA IS STILL SKEPTICAL that &quot;that&#039;s it&quot;, it&#039;s not like Danganronpa to outright tell us information like this soo easily without hiding some red herrings to double dupe us. Well if this ending IS TRUE really LA calls it an anti-climax because LA thinks that the TRUE finale is in the finale of finale&#039;s Kibou-hen, this ending is just a taste of what&#039;s to come. LA is SOO HOPEFUL right now.<br />
<br />
Mirai-hen being the finale of the entire series of Danganronpa does what it&#039;s meant to do, pit hope against hope to see which one will go on to the future and watching both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen in conjunction with one another just made the mystery of the traitor, character development of the newer characters, not only was the 2 animes of Danganronpa within the same season something rather uniquely done and presented, but executed quite well and quite honestly seeing Danganronpa&#039;s final chapters was something both to praise about and weep for as it&#039;s finally ending in the most bloody ways possible with it bringing in near impossible murder mysteries and homicidal robot bears and zany and eccentric characters. LA was thankful that not only were there gonna be 2 animes of Danganronpa but that even Mirai-hen on it&#039;s own satisfying LA&#039;s craving for more Danganronpa and Mirai-hen took that expectations and easily exceeded LA&#039;s expectation for it (even with that rather anti-climax of an ending)...and even more once Hope arc arrives for the finale to end all finale&#039;s!!!

Danganronpa 3 The End Of Hope&#039;s Peak High School Future and Hope Arc is the first part of the danganronpa 3 anime meant to be watched along with the despair arc. As they are practically the same with hope being a 22 minute special that serves as the anime&#039;s conclusion, I have decided to review both of them at the same time. Danganronpa 3 Future Arc tells the story of the fate of all the future foundation&#039;s members that are forced to play the final killing game after they assembled for a meeting that acts as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382748">
        a trial for Makoto Naegi, while Hope arc tells the story of the anime&#039;s conclusion and what happened to the characters that have survived, plus the fate of Class 77th as well. <br />
<br />
First of all let me get started by stating that I felt like the entire anime&#039;s existence is unecessary, and that they only made it for the money and fanservice, sure it&#039;s great to see all these characters again and how they&#039;re doing, but honestly for me Danganronpa is a franchise that works more the less things are explained to you, it works better with ambuiguity behind it, since the anime drops a lot of exposition for the audience and it somehow still ends up being convoluted  as hell. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s move on to the negatives of Future arc.<br />
To get things started it was a lot more boring and less exciting than I thought it would end up as, it was a shame that they had a really good build-up for it as in the form of the first episode, that opening episode alone got me intrigued and curious to what sort of motive and masterplan the mastermind is scheming, and what I get is just not what I wanted, furthermore I felt like the pacing was kinda off even if you watch this side to side with despair arc, there&#039;s still that lingering feeling that this show&#039;s pacing is not optimal  being there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next up let&#039;s talk about the plot, oh shit we got a lot of brainwashing and weird idealism going on, while character&#039;s go insane just for the sake of the story advancing and them doing what their role is according to the mastermind&#039;s plan. I personally call bullshit, the plan itself is ass and the twists that were used to build it up went to waste, seriously Tengan man you set up a killing game so that every member of the future foundation kills each other, so you can crack Mitarai and have him brainwash the world ridding it with both hope and despair, now if that isn&#039;t the most idealistic and stupidest thing I&#039;ve ever heard then I don&#039;t know what is. Okay so first things first Tengan bro, it is heavily implied that you watched the video that causes people to crave despair since Chisa handed it to you, but hey you could have just not watched it, plus it wasn&#039;t really clarified it is just implied, next up let&#039;s say that you did watch the video and now you&#039;re brainwashed with despair, can&#039;t you come up with a better more full-proof plan than whatever garbage you ended up with. What happens if Mitarai Ryouta just dies in the killing game ha? You didn&#039;t even account him showing up in the killing game in the first place, see not all things go according to plans jeez, plus you&#039;re plan is dookie buns bro come on I know it&#039;s danganronpa, but even TeruTeru can come up with a better scheme than you, Tengan bro get your shit together. <br />
<br />
There was a lot of cliffhangers in between episodes in this show, but they didn&#039;t work for me, you know something is wrong with a show when the person watching the cliffhangers reaction is &quot;I&#039;m not really feeling like I wanna watch more, Imma watch the next episode later&quot; Now correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but aren&#039;t cliffhangers supposed to get you hyped or pumped-up for the next episode, the ones in this show had the opposite effect and I still don&#039;t know how they managed to do it. <br />
<br />
Finally the characters, they are not only annoying but they are not memorable and even worth paying attention too, I honestly was hoping that except for the old cast for all these new characters to just straight up drop dead, for example Izayou and his girlfriend, hell this girl got so much screentime and she was also meant to serve as one of the side villains, and I dont even remember her name lol, I remember calling her Candy Girl or something, that should tell you how much I care about these characters Lmao. <br />
<br />
For the good parts of the anime, the old cast was great, it was nice seeing them once again and them acting like their old selves, great fanservice, but that&#039;s pretty much it for the positives of this anime, I guess they do a great job at maintaining a eiree and dreadful atmosphere, the animation, artstyle and the Ed are great as well I guess. Oh one more thing I forgot about the negatives, they showed that they potentially wanted to kill off some of the main characters such as Asahina in episode 2, and Kirigiri in the tenth episode, but guess what they were too scared that they were going to upset the fans so they all kept them alive for a happy ending, I personally think they should have just killed off Kyoko, and I&#039;m team Naegiri, but killing her off would have left more of a impact and kept the paranoia they were going for more alive, instead of the audience just knowing that they will be fine since there is like 3 episodes left lol. <br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about the ending, that&#039;s right Hope Arc, now when I first started watching this mess of an anime I thought that the Hope Arc was an actual arc like despair and future, but it turns out it&#039;s just a 22 minute special. Now the ending aka Hope Arc it was not good, but it was salvageable to say the least, since they utilized class 77 and made em do the majority of the work, incidentally the ship that is known as Naegiri finally set sail Wohoo!! Let&#039;s Go!! All aboard the SS Naegiri, I&#039;m your captain Cyranical. The ending for me lacked a little bit of oomph, like sure it&#039;s a happy ending and it ends off with everything working out for the characters, but I still can&#039;t shake this feeling off me that they could have done a better ending, but it is what it is I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-Had a good eiree and dreadful atmosphere to it suiting the tone that they were going for<br />
-Banger ED<br />
-Old cast is here and they are still theirselves<br />
-Great animation and artstyle<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Characters that we&#039;re not memorable, interesting nor worthwhile<br />
-Anime felt uncessary and was only done for fanservice and money<br />
-Thrash OP<br />
-Plot is really bad, can probably be blamed on bad writing, but it&#039;s Danganronpa so who cares<br />
-Showed that they were potentially willing to kill off the main characters for more shock value, but did not end up going through with it<br />
-Is boring and not as interesting as you as the viewer would expect it to be<br />
<br />
Overall Danganronpa 3 The End Of Hope&#039;s Peak High School, both Future and Hope Arc feel like uncessary additions to the franchise, and we&#039;re only done for the fanservice and the money. In addition to this it&#039;s writing is not only poor, but the characters themselves are mundane and not likeable, while the execution of the plot and the premise also leaves a lot to be desired, since not only is the show boring and not as exciting as it was hoping to be, the pacing of it was also really wonky, incidentally the story manages to still be convoluted while having so much exposition behind it. If you&#039;re a Danganronpa fan I honestly just recommend you play all the games, yes including despair girls, and read Danganronpa IF and Zero, since Danganronpa the animation is atrociously bad and Danganronpa 3 The End Of Hope&#039;s Peak High School is just  straight up unnecessary. Overall I give Danganronpa 3 The End Of Hope&#039;s Peak both Future and Hope arc a 5/10 for my overall anime rating.

    The concluding part of Danganronpa story turns out to be an utter garbage that surprisingly manages to butcher the original series&#039; spirit by presenting criminally uninteresting setting, boring and flat characters, downright ridiculous storyline with ton of plotholes, and loads of stupid out-of-place fanservice on top of that.<br />
<br />
A scene where newly-added &quot;your ordinary schoolgirl&quot; character casually fights hundreds of mechanical Monocumas with laser-shooting megaphone (showing off her pants in the process) describes this anime as none better.<br />
<br />
Story — as said above, horrible. The only reason the plot is not predictable is that it is illogical as hell. 1/10<br />
Art — the visual style lost some of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348354">
        the first season&#039;s charm, but at least it still provides dark atmosphere and is ok to look at. Ah, and I liked mature Kirigiri&#039;s design. 6/10 <br />
Sound — can&#039;t say much in particular, but OP was definitely nowhere near first season. 5/10<br />
Characters — a mess. Show does not present any interesting characters (with a couple of exceptions maybe) and just uses already developed heroes from previous seasons without adding much to their personalities. One would expect much more from a Danganronpa anime. 4/10<br />
Enjoyment — basically, I just cringed and skipped through last episodes just to find out whether some people really die when they are killed. Again, definitely not what I expected when started to watch. 3/10<br />
 <br />
Overall — 3/10.

    It&#039;s hard to objectively look at the series you invested hours and hours into.<br />
<br />
This anime will not be for everyone. Even if you decide to play through all the visual novels and a spin-off game (which is rather crucial to the story as well), there is a chance you&#039;ll find it &quot;unnecessary&quot;, &quot;poor&quot; or just horrible and not deserving to be part of the series. I got a lot more out of the anime than I was originally expected, being told by everyone, how bad this show is. If you played through all the games, I dont see a reason why you wouldn&#039;t atleast try

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305630">
        this. I will keep this review as spoiler-free as I can. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with praising the Opening, as it really deserved it. Visuals are beautiful, it doesn&#039;t shove any important plot points into your face, and, of course, the song itself is amazing.<br />
<br />
This is only half of the show, and I recommend alternating between Future Arc and Despair arc episode by episode (starting with future) as that will save some interesting surprises for both serieses. You should also alternate between this review and one on Despair arc. Which is an obvious joke and you shouldn&#039;t bother, but the idea of having to watch two shows at the same time is rather interesting and works surprisingly well for this one. <br />
<br />
One of the most apparent reasons to watch this anime is for the characters, and this one really delivers. Some characters weren&#039;t fully explored, due to the nature of the killing game, some are more fleshed out in the despair arc, some get maybe a bit too much screentime, but the original gang is back and it was really nice to see them again. New characters were really hit or miss, and I wish some of them survived for longer, but thats part of the fun I guess. I dont think this would work as any game, same as the original visual novel didn&#039;t work as anime, this story is not &quot;Danganronpa 3, but the anime for some reason&quot;, it is a way to tie all loose ends which in theory works much better than a VN would. If it suceeds in practice, is another question. There are many pretty obvious plot holes in this story, some things happen just because, it isn&#039;t clear how some stuff works, characters sometimes act irrationally, some long awaited questions aren&#039;t satisfying enough or not given at all, etc. But you shouldn&#039;t expect any serious realism from this anime. Original VN had many silly moments as well. Many plot holes can be explained if you think about the situation the characters have to face and overall pressure on them (and also the ridiculous setting of the series of actual superhumans existing here, wiping out armies with ease). I dont think it makes the anime much worse, but some moments did sting a little, esspecially near the end. Danganronpa always had some problems with satisfying and logical endings, and this one is not really an exception. The overall plot is really a 7 because of it, it isn&#039;t horrible, and it has some good moments, but I dont think it is on par with the games. And despite that, there were enough moments to keep me invested in it, making it hard to wait through an episode of Despair arc to find out what happens next here (which, honestly, was the case for Despair arc too, and was the weirdest thing I&#039;ve experienced while watching an anime).<br />
<br />
Did I mention that art is pretty good yet? The colour scheme and shots convey the atmosphere very well, action scenes, while not being super detailed, are well animated and it is clear that a lot of work went into them. There is some repetition in shots, but there aren&#039;t too many to get in your eyes. Overall, Lerche did a really good job with this one. I expected to be always disturbed by the blood not being trademark pink, as it was in VNs, but it surprisingly fitted more to the story it was trying to tell. <br />
<br />
I suppose what matters the most, is if it does well as the continuation and partly conclusion of the series. And I think that the answer is yes. It doesn&#039;t ruin any already established characters or concepts, it evolves them, it really feels like those characters indeed have suffered through a lot of despair, esspecially the characters from the first game. It is worthy to be in the series, as I see it. <br />
<br />
I really loved playing through the games, and I loved watching this anime, no matter how silly it was at times. If compared to Despair arc, I&#039;d say that this one is worse of a final product, but thats mostly because I enjoyed the second game so much. If you just want more danganronpa, this is for you, there is not much more like this, in both anime or videogames. It isn&#039;t flawless, but it really isn&#039;t as bad as some say. I give this show a subjective 9 and an objective 7, which rounds up to an 8, cus I make the rules here. Now, go watch it if you haven&#039;t already and let the game begin!<br />
<br />
Also, ED is good, but I skipped it maybe a bit too much.

    Honestly, I&#039;m really disappointed I really hoped for something good but well the DESPAIR won once again...<br />
<br />
My biggest problem with Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen (besides this long name) is that it feels so passionless.<br />
<br />
New characters are either boring or forgettable and the old ones don&#039;t develop at all. <br />
Even worse! This instalment made me NOT CARE for them! <br />
The story is really really basic and simple no twists <br />
(at least not those that you cant see right away) and moments that shocking are those that make completely no sense. <br />
Music is decent animation too. <br />
<br />
If you are a fan go ahead and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331081">
        watch it is not the worst by any means but if you are new to the series DONT WATCH IT it will spoil the good parts for you.

    I need to play the games to watch this anime? Well, you can go forward from the first Danganronpa anime, that&#039;s ok, but if you wanna enjoy the 2 arcs of this last story it&#039;s recommended at least, Super Danganronpa 2 to be played.<br />
<br />
Another recommendation if you gonna start the anime, it&#039;s see a chapter of this arc and 1 of the despair one, and repeat the process for better understanding.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start, we got to the point to at last see a end of the situations involving hope and despair with its roots at Kibougamine Gakuen painting an end... This anime gonna start at the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230738">
        end of Super Danganronpa 2 (They gonna fill you up in some details needed in this story, if you don&#039;t play the game) with our very proud and powerful lucky student, Naegi Makoto being putting in scene in a new mutual killing game with less time and more ferocious Ultimate Students, former ones, the Future Foundation itself, and the usual, but maybe less powerful Monokuma.<br />
<br />
First, the characters, as always, very rare talents attached to very rare people again, they are cool in a sense, but well, they gonna end dead at the very end, but belive me, they all are ultimates, so they are special, you don&#039;t gonna be bored with their actions.<br />
<br />
Second, the story, this maybe could get very tedious, because, after hear hope, hope, hope, hope, in a game, and an anime before, you think it&#039;s enough, but this is the end, so, bear it again, please... the flow, it&#039;s more like a premises of the future with the need of a connection of the past to still keep forward (Zetsubou-hen), even so, the flow of the characters, the situations, the revelations that get connections at this very point to get an end, that is the real flavor of this story, its very meaning, a very cool one, because the new mystery of the killings it&#039;s easy but you are here for answers, of course.<br />
<br />
And third, the music and CG, have very much connection with the first story, so you gonna still hear the usual BGMs and sounds, with the Psycho Pop style of Danganronpa with more elegance and technology, well, Psycho-Technology, rare, but that make it great.<br />
<br />
At the end you need this and the despair one, to end this at the Kibou-Hen, so it&#039;s a good anime, a good story, necessary to fill us up with its answers altogether with the other arc, maybe we expect something different, but when you reach the end of each arc, you see the meaning and good synergy of this last track of the path.<br />
<br />
If you reach this part of the review, feeling this useful or maybe nothing at all... anyway, thank you so much for your time, and happy anime, may the hope protect you from the despair, pupupupu.

    the story so far has been more enjoyable and less childish than the first season and i must say, the art and the music have improved as well. The plot is pretty likable and as always, no one is safe from dying in Danganronpa. i have just watched episode 9, and i think all of this will change in the last 3 episodes*NO spoilers ahead*: if Kodaka brings the dead back to life, He will be ruining the whole idea of danganronpa. it will just turn out the same as sword art online, maybe he can make it interesting, so i will wait and see<br />

Rating<br />
-Story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231783">
        : 8/10 *so far* this might change according to the ending<br />
-Art: 10/10 the characters to be exact look cooler and more mature than season 1<br />
-sound: 8/10 the opening and ending are one of my favorite of this season but the BGM in the first season made things more alive in my opinion<br />
-character: unlike season 1, i felt sorry for people dying in this season, tho we still didn&#039;t get enough details about their personalities, we got hints that were enough to boost the story<br />
-Enjoyment: 9/10 the best part of danganronpa is the number of plot twists you encounter every week that leaves you speechless and more eager to see how it all ends<br />
-overall 8/10 i believe this season is going to increase the number of newcomers to the danganronpa world<br />
this is my first review *i&#039;m just pissed off by the thought of how kodaka will end the whole thing or how i think he is gonna do *<br />
Edit: the review was deleted but anyways the ending is what we all expected and that&#039;s the point

so, before I start this review (sorry english isn&#039;t my mother language), you have to know something before watching DR3 Mirai-hen : - You have to play/watch a LP of DR1 (or watch the anime), DR2 and Ultra Despair Girls because you won&#039;t be able to understand everything that happens in the show.<br />
<br />
- You have to watch Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen at the same time like this : Ep1 Mirai, Ep 1 Zetsubou, Ep 2 Mirai, Ep 2 Zetsubou...Ep 12 Mirai, Kibou-hen.<br />
<br />
Story : 10/10<br />
<br />
Nothing more to say, I have never seen something like that : brilliant story and plot twists. I cried a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230456">
        lot of times. A lot of people hated the end of Mirai-hen but I found it brilliant because it&#039;s a really interesting idea Kodaka got.<br />
<br />
Art : 8/10<br />
<br />
Nothing really exceptional, nothing really bad. The animation is really good. I don&#039;t have a lot to say.<br />
<br />
Sound : 10/10<br />
<br />
The OST is really good but thumbs up for the opening and the ending which are for me one of the best (especially the ending). They are really beautiful.<br />
<br />
Character : 9/10 <br />
<br />
Every characters are interesting, thanks to Zetsubou-hen which takes place in the past, before the start of DR1, you learn a lot about the new characters (Seiko, Ruruka, Izayoi, Munakata, Ryota and some more). You easily understand why they are doing what they are doing and you are really moved when something happens to them. For the DR1 survivors, they are really great and Kyoko got even more character development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even know how to describe every emotions I got when watching this anime : sadness, happiness, fear, angst...just wow.<br />
<br />
Overall : 10/10<br />
<br />
A lot of people will disagree but I don&#039;t care, for me DR3 is one of the best things I have ever seen in terms of story, sound or characters. A masterpiece.

    I&#039;ve only gotten into the Danganronpa series this past month, but the action packed in this season really brought back all the good parts of the original and made it much more fast-paced and dynamic. Its the perfect blend of action and psychological action. If only it didn&#039;t emphasize on hope and despair so much. We get it, Naegi is &quot;Ultimate Hope&quot; and so forth, but it just forces those two words around and around and around. It goes from trying to but despair as the overlapping theme to just full out &quot;despair, 絶望. despair, 絶望, despair, 希望, hope , despair, and so on. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230412">
        just made the anime a bit less entertaining. Overall, this anime was one of my top 10 anime of the season,  maybe even number 1. I strongly suggest this anime to a lot of fans out there who are looking for good and action-packed anime.
