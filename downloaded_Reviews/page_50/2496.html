    There’s a lot of talk about destiny these days. Destiny is apparently something that is predetermined and carried by fate. It’s said whatever happens to someone or something is predetermined and that we cannot escape fate. Take Valvrave the Liberator for example. Was it fate that caused Haruto Tokishima to become a pilot of the Valvrave? Was it fate that made L-Elf betray his former teammates and become labeled as an enemy of Dorissa? Did fate tie the both of them together to create a new world with their own ideologies? Perhaps but fate isn’t what controls our destiny. We make each and every decision

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125737">
        by ourselves. In fact, every action has a consequence.<br />
<br />
Valvrave the Liberator returns to its second half after the cliffhanger ending left off from its first season. The series is an original mecha series produced by Sunrise known for their other works of similar genre. For a show that takes place in a futuristic setting, it’s no surprise that Valvrave the Liberator has more advanced technology compared than our very own. It sets forth a setting where war takes on a form like never before with the introduction of the Valvraves – powerful advanced weaponry of war with mysterious origins. Haruto was just a high school student but his life changes forever after he becomes one of its pilots.<br />
<br />
The second half of this show takes directly after the major cliffhanger from where season 1 left off so expect yourself to be familiarized with what’s going on. The series focuses on the war between the Dorissa and JIOR, a neutral nation. Season 1 of Valvrave the Liberator build itself on the foundation of a mecha show with mass amount of ludicrous events, mind-blowing action, and psychological integrity. Season 2 doesn’t’ stray off much from that. In fact, the second season intensifies itself even more through various stages. These stages stack up that ultimately engineers the story to wrap up this series with questions that fuels answers. Some of these questions will leave viewers in a state of ‘oh, it makes sense now’ while others may result in different responses of turbulence. This is especially true for its conclusion that will leave viewers with a cloud of questions.<br />
<br />
Unlike season 1 however, there’s a sense of morality to be fueled towards the minds of its characters. A major theme of humanity and identity becomes pivotal that is explored in this second season. This is evidenced by the infamous term ‘monster’, a word of controversy that is mentioned by various characters. What exactly constitutes a monster? Is it someone who is merely defined as being non-human or someone that has the brutality of an animal? We find out in this season exactly how and what breeds a monster. Viewers will be surprised at how they are judged by the characters of this series. As in this case, ideologies clashes and egos fueled by power become a struggle for dominance between the two sides.<br />
<br />
All the characters return in the sequel; well the ones that are alive anyways. Keep in mind that Valvrave the Liberator isn’t shy to avoid brutal death scenes or violence. But for now, most of the characters as we know it returns with their various roles. Haruto is no longer a student at school buried in his textbooks but becomes a pioneer along with his unlikely ally L-Elf to start a revolution against Dorssia. Their goal: to build a new nation with their own ideologies that seems to clash against those that are already established. L-Elf plays the role of an anti-hero with his cunning mind and to set forth is own plans into action. He is a man that is integrity that is defined by his intellect and skill. Although we initially sees the man as one whose heart is cold as frost, there is also more than meets the eye after we see bits of his past. His love for a sudden character becomes a motivation for him to fight what he believes in. Although Haruto and L-Elf don’t get along as best friends, the duo can make up an excellent team when the time calls for it. Most of the time though, they are like oil and water, like colors red and blue, like yin and yang.<br />
<br />
Other characters also make prominent highlights in both series including a sudden supporting character. She holds a dark secret that is revealed after a traumatic event. Of course, we can’t forget important female characters such as Shouko, Saki, and Akira. None of them are alike but they each play pivotal roles in determining the outcome of the war. Unlike season 1, Shouko is now a political leader of the New JIOR. Although she holds very important responsibilities, Shouko is still shows emotions especially when she finds out a devastating secret that changes her outlook of others forever. On the other hand, Saki plays more of the role of a soldier and pilot. Just like season one, she is still an idol and remains popular but not always for the right reasons. For instance, she also withholds a secret that mostly others aren’t aware of. It’s not until a certain event that triggers what we can call a ‘travesty of justice’. Still, the theme of identity plays more of the important role here as we witness stages unfold.<br />
<br />
It also shouldn’t be startling to realize that violence and murders occurs in this show with a enormous amount of brutality. Blood is spilled and with action exploding in viewers’ faces as the two sides clash. For sudden characters, death flags are raised and set high in the sky until the point hits its mark. Sudden characters on both sides make their prominent highlights either in combat as they try to make a difference. One particular character stands out named Liselelotte who is known as the childhood friend of L-Elf. She is also the princess of Dorssia with secrets of her own. It’s interesting to see her history with L Elf and the circumstances with him. In fact, these circumstances intensify in a climatic episode that will change L-Elf’s life forever. But if we’re talking about Dorssia Military Pact Federation, that’s a different story. They write chapters into people’s lives in the wrong way with their actions that speaks louder than words. Characters such as A-Drei, Q-vier, and the totalitarian leader Cain all makes their actions well known that not only changes others peoples’ lives but also influences others in the different ways. In essence, they are devices that are set in motion ready to explode to do their worst. However, not every member of the Federation is a demon as you will see later on with their own ideologies.<br />
<br />
While the first season explored some of the histories of the main characters, L-Elf perhaps lacked a bit of character depth. In this second season, we get to know him a lot more through flashbacks. These aren’t happy memories but L Elf still holds them dearly to his heart, so much in fact that one sudden event in the present causes him to become catatonic at one point. <br />
<br />
Despite the fact that the show explores our some our main characters’ dynamics, not many of them are characterized with development. Their minds are still set on their goals. This series doesn’t do well for developing its characters considering most of the time, the main plot focuses on the war itself. Although some characters are able to make dramatic entrances and exits, none of them really stand out on their own. They are motivated by what they believe in fighting for. It doesn’t go in depth with their reasoning or purpose on many occasions. More so, there is also some red herring that could be hard to categorize for its story. Some characters’ revelations might be startling but makes little sense. A few of them also never get what they want that will likely make viewers sympathizes with them (for the wrong reasons) but realizing time can’t return to undo the events. As opposed the season 1, the second season lacks comedy and fan service. It completely omits asinine episodes involving high school musicals or absurdity of the implied rape scenes. The vampire nature is still there however and certain scenes still defies logic. This season may also feel rushed with its plot twists on various occasions or at times feels a bit slow. Absurd should be used as a frequent word for Valvrave the Liberator as well. This show is irrational on many stages with levels that unfold themselves more and more. It’s hard to take the series seriously even with all the gruesome events. Some of them may feel tragic, dramatic, or can even capable of shredding a few tears. Unfortunately, most of these events comes out as predictable, impractical, and laughable. And no, it’s not funny, or at least in the right way.<br />
<br />
Artwork remains generally the same as season 1. Sunrise is involved with the production with its character designs. The Valvraves remains generally the same as they were once before with their remarkable and stunning designs that gives them their reputations. On the other hand, the enemies of new JITOR have also evolved with their new lines of weaponry. Their new weapons of war gives some depth of their uniqueness although they lack the style of the Valvraves. Background designs stands as they were from previously while none of the characters goes through under significant physical changes. Mentally however, that’s another story…<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of the series is tolerable although seems to be forceful at times with its background music/OST. This is usually defined by its more emotional scenes and character tones. In particular, L Elf shows more emotions in this season more than ever. Ryōhei Kimura (Magi: Judal, Silver Spoon: Yugo, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai: Kodaka) is known for playing a variety of characters of different natures. L Elf is a calculating man but his voice becomes more of a distress in this sequel similarly to some of the other pilots. There’s not much to comment on most of the characters’ tones as many sounds frightened after learning some startling revelations. Still there are some voices that are also defines confidence and hope and I give praise in their tone in such a dark world Valvrave takes place in. Nana Mizuki x T.M.Revolution returns to their roles for performing the main themes and I give praise for their performance in that.<br />
<br />
Overall, a sequel doesn’t always pull out the right tricks out of their hats. Sometimes, things can go wrong and makes it into a mess that is hard to redeem itself. Valvrave the Liberator is one such series that has issues that messes with logic at its finest. There are moments that shines itself with its characters and twists but most of it is masked by its absurdity. Not everything may ever make sense at the end either and will raise many questions for viewers. At other times, the show becomes absurd with its revelations and deaths that are triggered by previously flags that blows in the wind. The action is still there though so prepare yourself for a ride of mecha madness, clash of egos, and battle royal of ideologies. Oh and I almost forgot…absurdity. <br />

    &quot;Will avenging someone’s death bring them back to life? Instead of that, you should think about how to prevent future losses. War is something that should be conducted calmly and efficiently, like a machine.&quot; L-elf.<br />
<br />
Kakumei Valvrave is a truly brilliant anime about revolution. High school students making their own country, which looks utterly unrealistic but somehow appealing. In a futuristic setting, the main plot is about war itself. Tactics, resolves, and feelings of main and supportive characters are explored, from L Elf, the one man army to Haruto, the frightened high school student who turns into a monster. Dramatic moments make the protagonists learn more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review128147">
        about themselves and what they are fighting for. As one would expect from the author of Code Geass, this mecha anime is not only about mind blowing fights, brilliant tactics and aching hearts, it focuses on the definition of a monster which is highly controversial. Is it a non-human being or is it someone too brutal to be human ? The second question focuses on change and peace. What does it take to achieve peace ? <br />
<br />
Through the two seasons of Kakumei Valvrave, the animation is flawless, the chara design impeccable. The opening and ending songs are brilliant and the soundtrack fitting. The voice actors cast is great, with a special mention to L Elf seiyuu.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this anime. A 10 out of 10.<br />

    Sometimes the ending of a story is not appropriate with what we want. But because of that, we can learn something...<br />
<br />
The 2nd season is more focused in the plot elements, the story expresses its complexity better than its previous season. Another interesting point is the story is full of excitement and surprises, it really boosts the enjoyment of the series. All of the mysteries is revealed and clarified. But besides that, Valvrave have some minus points, the story pace is still unstable, first it have a slow to medium pacing, but in the last 3 episodes, the story increases its speed to its full limit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181426">
        of velocity, it really makes the ending feel so forced. Also, there are some scenes that told in different times that makes the ending more predictable.The ending has some moral lessons behind, &#039;&#039;sacrifice is needed in order to change something&#039;&#039;<br />
<br />
The animation still looks awesome like the 1st season, it has a great details and battle action.The sound settings is another good thing, the opening song &quot;Kakumei Dualism&quot; sung by Nana Mizuki and T.M Revolution really got the beat. The seiyuu did fairly well job in bringing their character.<br />
<br />
The character development is not really different with the 1st season. There is some character development that occurs, but not really necessary &amp; related  with the story. The major development is centered in our 2nd male lead, L-Elf while another character beside him is still relatively flat and uninteresting. The villain reason is abstract, the romance feeling from the 1st season is gone.<br />
<br />
Although the character development really fails, but Valvrave successfully brings the individual element of the story, in the end, the tale of Japanese Mecha Vampire is over peacefully...It is surely a decent anime.

    -(Also sorry for long post but I have too... :d)<br />
Idk what some people are saying, but this was an AMAZING anime! Great characters, story, action, drama..everything! Not to mention a Killer soundtrack! The only thing that might be frustrating and probably why it got the rating it had, was because the anime episodes ran in a pattern of &quot;sequel, prequel, sequel&quot;( if that makes sense, it&#039;s kinda like Lord of rings, Hobbit, Lord of rings) for each episode. Which you really had to pay attention and use your brain to catch on. I actually would have classified the anime as mystery as well because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186034">
        the pattern. I highly recommend it if you like that sort of stuff where you have to figure things out, or just in general. The story kept building/stacking as well making it climax every episode which I really enjoyed! <br />
-The thing I didn&#039;t like though if, I had to say that some may not like, was it&#039;s sexual situations(typical anime women stuff). It was kinda out of place for that anime lol.The ending was a bit frustrating as well because I think there wasn&#039;t enough back story on some more characters, like l-elf, Q-Vier, and Cain, which I believe they might of done to make an OVA or something.   Other than that it was great! <br />
I hope there&#039;s a season 3 or OVA! I&#039;m definitely voting for it lol oh and I hope Shoko Gets stabbed so many times she never comes back to life (excuse my language, but watch anime to understand)! <br />
Do watch if you need an anime... but beware... so much more feels! :D<br />

    Finally done with Valvrave the Liberator, or just Kakumeiki Varuvureivu. <br />
<br />
Thoughts - That was one clusterfuck of awesome. First 12 episodes gave a me a complete &quot;Oh right it&#039;s Sunrise, dead men don&#039;t stay dead...&quot; and &quot;Fuck logic&quot;. Only for it to end in one epic cliffhanger.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I was expecting another clusterfuck of shit that is so bad that you just can&#039;t stop watching in S2. But really, while logic continues to defies itself, Sunrise did a pretty decent job covering up the gaping hole in the plot. Not that it&#039;s perfect, but it was still one hell of a ride. You either love it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130763">
        to bit, hate it, or just go &#039;VALVRAVEEEEEEEEEEE&quot;<br />
<br />
That said, I have to hand it to Sunrise for making good use of decent supporting characters and killing them off before they make too much of a negative impact. So here&#039;s to Kyuma Inuzuka, Raizo Yamada and Marie Nobi for making it fun while it lasted. You guys served a good purpose. Felt that Ikusain&#039;s death a bit too rush though. Sunrise prolly went...&quot;Yea we killed all the Valvrave pilots, gotta level up the playing field a little...&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s still a little confusing here and there..the plot wise. Like, seriously are we talking about Aliens now? too little explainations, too little on how the damned Council was founded and how it got wiped out. And suddenly that slime faced American president decides to turn against the Magius? Just Staph.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also rather generic mecha, except Sunrise has learned its lesson by not over-using stock. Pretty good animation work I say. <br />
<br />
And romance. oh romance. Still cannot comprehend the fact that Haruto confessed his love to Shoko, not to her, but to L-Elf. That&#039;s one weird as hell death flag.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, can I say the bromance between Haruta and L-Elf is the best since Lulu and Suzaku?<br />
And not one noticed it&#039;s weird that alien Prue has a massive thing for his sister Pino?<br />
<br />
But in a nutshell, I&#039;m quite glad I didn&#039;t drop this episode. It was a fun ride.<br />
And once more....VALVRAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

    Sunrise has always been a one-trick pony, using a gundam type of storyline that spreads throughout all their storylines, be it code geass or gundam seed stc. So for Valvrave, an anime original from sunrise that is yet again another Mecha, would it follow the same tropes as its previous series? The answer is yes. However, that should not stop you from watching it because its a ride worth taking despite its cliches. While Valvrave season 1 was extremely absurd and down-right stupid at times (random school singing), season 2 brought the meat of the story and played its cards right overall despite a seemingly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125771">
        lack-luster ending.<br />
<br />
Story-7<br />
<br />
As a sequel, the story for season 2 capitalizes on how Haruto and company&#039;s flight and fight from Dossia and eventually other forces. This coupled with some political back-story makes up for an interesting premise despite it being done already by some series. However, at times it falls into the trap of having some ass-pulls which leaves some distaste for viewers. Take for example, a certain episode was having a peace conference when suddenly the enemy turns up and convinces everyone of a party being &quot;monsters&quot;, this in my opinion are some of the various questionable writing which may be unsatisfactory at times to downright laughable. Another thing to add was the ending, in my opinion it was a solid ending but at the same time, left too many questions unanswered. With all these plot holes building up, it would certainly leave its audience unsatisfied unless there is a confirmation for a third season, very similar to a guilty crown-isque ending.  Nevertheless, I applaud them for sticking strong to the plot without side-tracking too much, thus allowing it to remain intriguing.<br />
<br />
Art/animation-8<br />
<br />
While it is not something we have never seen before, it is definitely good. The animation is clean and detailed. One thing to note are the mecha designs, they look absolutely fantastic and even better when in battle. The fights are nicely choreographed and uncensored deaths while albeit morbid at times, give a better feeling than what it is like to be censored.<br />
<br />
Sound-8<br />
<br />
The opening &quot;Kakumei Dualism&quot; by Mizuki Nana and T.M Revolution gives a pumping feel to the series as a whole, which is extremely suitable given the general atmosphere of the series. The Ending themes &quot;Realism&quot; and &quot;Akai Memorīzu o Anata ni&quot; by Elisa and Momoko Kanade give the ominous feeling to set the tone of the future episodes within the series. What I like in particular is the use of ending themes from season 1 in some of the fights to certainly set the mood, especially if it was a tragic character. As for the music within the episodes, while certainly not bad, they were not really memorable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters-7<br />
<br />
Characters are somewhat decent here due to some character development. Our protagonist Haruto a foolish high-school student at first evolves into someone with resolve to protect what is dear to him. While the other main character L-Elf is the cool white haired badass that everyone looks up to, only to experience a tragedy before redeeming himself later on. Other memorable side characters include Saki, Shoko, Yamada, Akira, Kyuma and Mari, all whom get a tinge of development here and there. With that said however, there were quite a few problems. Firstly due to its very large cast, it is inevitable that quite a few are undeveloped. With the exception of Satomi and Takahi, alot of side characters tend to get largely ignored, which is further evident in the last episode. Furthermore, the villains also get considerably low screen time. The main antagonist Cain only gets 2 dedicated episodes of fighting while most of the time, the series just shows glimpse shots of him formulating plans. Another problem is the blatant use of death flags for quite a few characters, while it is understandable that it is used to advance the story or motivate another character, at times it seems largely unnecessary, which causes more plot holes since the character is not fully explored such as the case with Mari. Despite all these, the cast is not too bad and although it could be improved, it is certainly decent enough for an audience to care about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-9<br />
<br />
I came into the series intrigued by the idea of vampires mixed with Mechas and i was on the edge of my seat throughout season 2. I liked it through and through and was always anticipating the next episode because i was always interested to see what would happen next. While the ending may feel somewhat unsatisfactory for some, I personally feel it was the best they could do if they do intend to make a third season or an OVA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I rate Valvrave season 2 an 8/10. Depending on personal enjoyments, it may range from 6-8 for many others. In my opinion, This show is a spiritual successor to the late Code Geass of 200X. Despite it&#039;s somewhat above average animation, Valvrave manages to enrapture its audience though a witty use of interesting characters such as L-elf, excellent music direction even if the music may not be to your tastes, and twists and turns that leave you stunned in your seat and/or laughing at the unexpectedness that Valvrave the Liberator. Coming to you via your favorite family friendly services Hulu, Crunchyroll etc. <br />

    Alright let me go in on this freaking anime called Kakumeiki Valvrave! This flippin anime was epic! I gotta say it was amazing the first time around but they really stepped their game up for the 2nd season. I loved every minute of it. Characters were practically perfect for me. No one pissed me off at all very much. Thats a plus right there! The fighting in the anime was so freaking intense dude. I&#039;m so bummed its over. Anyway watch this if you want an anime with a very great story. Your honestly missing out if you dont watch!

    is it worth to use your memories exchange of greater power? <br />
some of us have good and bad memories, and some of us will use our memories in exchange of greater power because they have more bad memories than good.<br />
<br />
<br />
story: 8<br />
the story continue, and yet the student who made they own country still fighting for no reason. Still l-elf is the one who carry the whole anime, because of her title &quot; one man army &quot; ( most likely lelouch ). In my opinion, season 2 of Kakumeiki Valvrave have a good flow of story, because the viewers are starting to become confuse of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180227">
        story, why? In season 1 of Kakumeiki Valvrave, there are some still hole that cant be cover ( or spoiler from the future), and yet they still adding that &quot;hole&quot; even in this season. Even thought there is a hole, i can still cover it when im watching this anime because my thought is not on future, but on this present story of anime, i know some of the viewer always think on that future matters, and not on the main thought of story.<br />
there is another story in there:<br />
one day you will see something a different species, and when you see it you cant understand its language, and after a minute it copy your language and talk to you, then what will you do? 95% you will get a weapon and kill it right and the remaining 5% is, when you are weird enough you will talk to it and keep it at home, later it will become start of alien invasion. <br />
I mean, if we are normal human we will kill it and not to communicate to it, the &quot;magus or alien&quot; stating that the human start the war? there is a  part that human have a mistake part here and there is a time that magus or an alien have a wrong part here.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ART:8<br />
dorsian mecha is to unrealistic, well Kakumeiki Valvrave is from gundam seed/destiny, and some of the viewer ( me ) expecting a mecha from dorsian is good enough like a second generation of valvrave <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:9<br />
preserve rose ( s1 op) is good enough and have a good impact because its from gundam seed destiny version, but on Kakumeiki Valvrave s2 op i can say  its average.<br />
some of the insert instrumental music is good for battle soundtrack and they 100% fit on the anime. There is a drama part in there and some of music in there is fit too the scene.<br />
character voice:<br />
anime is enjoyable when you all know who is there character voice.  <br />
Kakumeiki Valvrave have a all star seiyuu. <br />
The F5- l-elf ( ryouhei kmura) h-neun ( mamoru miyano )  x-eins ( yohimasa hosoya)  q-vier ( yuuki kaji ) and a-drei ( jun fukuyama )<br />
i wont mention the others because they are to many of them, but i can say they are all good and all of them are in one anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
enjoyment: 9<br />
Kakumeiki Valvrave s1 and s2 can be market by girls because there are some part that have boys x boys relationship or a bit shounen ai, even thought i enjoy it because of drama and action. <br />
<br />
overall: <br />
the truth is, i enjoy this anime very much, its the same as other anime that have good ending, but this is the first anime i watch mecha-drama type that make you cry. The ending is not good or not bad, well average because i accept the ending of this anime. ( accept means im not expecting if there is a season 3 of this ).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />

    The second half of Valvrave the Liberator is the depressing tale shattering every illusion set up by the first season. Here we the viewers are exposed to the worst aspects of human irrationality as the characters begin to realise that not everything they thought they knew and could believe in was true. And much more true to the real world than most stories, nothing ever quite goes as planned, but in the end, everyone&#039;s passion and devotion to their friends and their ideals drives the plot through its tragic twists.<br />
<br />
Story -- While the basic story is ultimately interesting, eventually bringing together all of the elements

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125871">
        that overthrew the old world order, its execution was too often atrocious. For example, the main Dorssian characters start to become more complicated than they originally seemed, but their motives are never revealed in a truly satisfying way. The true nature of the magius is also shown, but the ending leaves the problem of their existence unresolved in a major way that left me wanting more to this story.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound -- Both are excellent. The music and voice acting captures the emotional aspects of the show, from the two sorrowful ending themes, &quot;Soba ni Iruyo&quot; and &quot;Akai Memories wo Anata ni&quot; to the feelings of desperation and vulnerability given to Shoko Sashinami by voice actress Masami Seto and the despair of L-Elf after losing his raison d&#039;etre captured by voice actor Ryohei Kimura. Once again the character and machine designs are beautiful, with good quality animation.<br />
<br />
Characters -- Some of the characters, such as Shoko, L-Elf -- and surprisingly, Marie -- get decent development, but there are some like Liselotte, Q-Vier and Yamada who remain something of a mystery to the very end. And then there are those like Haruto&#039;s father, who is maddeningly absurd in his complete disregard for social conventions -- a recurring problem with this series, when the characters are simply ... off, with nothing in particular behind it. <br />
<br />
Overall, Valvrave was quite enjoyable, though the ending seemed sudden and rushed, and left many questions unanswered, much like the first season of Code Geass. However, this series nevertheless was definitely an exciting and emotional watch, and I think it shines through despite its shortcomings.

    If you are searching for the pain and the suffering, that might be a good thing to watch. The ending is simply stupid if we consider the amount of pain that MC went through, yet the author... Here I will end.<br />
<br />
Anime itself isn&#039;t somehow stand-off, it was probably one of better anime the season it was aired in (personally, for me it was the best one). Yet characters are plain, story is quite retard, art and sound are pretty good though. But the enjoyment from the series... this one is pretty high. There are plenty of stuff that don&#039;t keep the shit together, yet it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125977">
        is still really decent anime. <br />
<br />
Though definetly, Season 1 was way superior if we talk about storyline kept together, in Season 2 we have way too many things that do not keep together making it a bit odd sometimes.<br />
<br />
Is it worth watching? If someone like to see youngsters feeling pain and suffering, then he will give 10, if someone rather want to see happy romantic comedy with good ending or at least mecha story with good romance involved... well then go watch something else.

    This review contains spoilers, read at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This review is more of a vent than anything else, coming back after 2 years to read it again sparks the fire that burnt out after finishing it. I remember how much I hated the characters in this Anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This animation... was absolutely horrible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#039;m just going to let Haruto do his thing with me, and when he mans up to take responsibility... I&#039;ll reject him?&quot; What the fuck, are you an idiot? and Haruto not expressing his feelings? What is he 12? No one in the whole world is that humble at that age. He&#039;s 17 for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156877">
        crying out loud. You might die tomorrow piloting that thing, might as well grow some hair. Plus you&#039;re killing thousands of human lives. The producers should&#039;ve thought of that. &quot;Oh this kid is going out there to kill his enemies to save his people.&quot;<br />
<br />
I understand this is about mechs and what not, but it&#039;s not listed under the fantasy genre, therefore those kids should have human thoughts. It&#039;s not easy to wave a sword and kill a person, unless you&#039;re like L-Elf and the Dorssians. The beginning was okay, I thought &quot;Well, he&#039;s not expressing his feelings for her, maybe when he&#039;s about to die he&#039;ll do it.&quot; Nope he didn&#039;t receive any closure, in fact, NO ONE (but Inuzuka) had closure. It was pathetic. No human being would act tough all the way till the end when they lose the bottom half of their body. Just the fact that people break easily all the time, crying to colorful drawings being animated and what not, should already be a sign that the human mind isn&#039;t as strong as those, things. Only Haruto had, some what, human feelings. He cried way too much though, and never spoke for himself, which pissed me off. I felt like reaching through the screen and punching him(or should I say her). Like, when Shoko called him a monster, he should&#039;ve exploded and been like &quot;WELL YOU KNOW WHAT BITCH, YOU GET IN THAT SHIT AND TRY IT OUT.&quot; or he could&#039;ve just told them all the truth about how they were all made in the VVV project to pilot Valvraves, and Inoko&#039;s(the one that shot him, I believe) father is one of the scientists that created them all.<br />
<br />
I hate animations where the main protagonist doesn&#039;t have balls. It&#039;s an Action/Mecha. Enough with all the poorly created, shit-hole characters. I&#039;ve watched way too many action animes where the main character is &quot;Oh I&#039;m so weak and lame, and I&#039;m going to cry 90% of the time&quot; then --character progression-- and wamm! I GREW BALLS... Pathetic, I want more animes with main characters that have guts already, but no strength, then grew strength. Like L-Elf. Even Neon Genesis was like this, but I gave it a pass because most of the main characters received closure, and the world was ending so... It&#039;s acceptable.<br />
<br />
I hope everyone reads this and just blows up, because that&#039;s human nature. Hate my review, my thoughts? Blow up, that&#039;s what you&#039;re supposed to do, but Haruto? He didn&#039;t do shit. Saki? Is SHIT, Shoko? IS SHIT, THEY&#039;RE ALL SHIT(besides L-Elf, Inuzaka, Yamada, and Akira for punching the floor with her Valvrave because of Shoko). One last thing, who the fuck&#039;s kid is that at the end? It better not be Saki&#039;s child, because it should look like Haruto, if it&#039;s Haruto&#039;s child, I won&#039;t hate this anime as much. If it is Saki&#039;s but not Haruto&#039;s, fuck you producers of Valvrave.

    Second Season of highly waited Kakumeiki Valvrave or Valvrave the Liberator.<br />
<br />
Personally I still say that this series is still one the best mecha anime series that i have watched so far. Characters interactions, darker theme of the episodes and entire season makes this far better enjoyment than season 1 was. Also the foreshadowing epilogues in some episodes that show parts of the future, keep fans questioning what does happen next and also wondering who in the end dies and who keeps their lives.<br />
<br />
Sinister plotting of the main antagonists and political scheming in both sides of the war keep characters and viewers in their toes about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143109">
        who can be trusted, what is going to happen in future, and just what happened in the war until the very final episode has been watched. Also more is finally revealed about Valvraves and characters pasts.<br />
<br />
Also just like season 1 shows there will be deaths in both sides, so no character of the series is save until very end of the series. Deaths are mostly dramatic just as expected, and they can either give characters necessary growth, or break their will competently.<br />
<br />
Also revelations of just what Kami-seiki (God Spirits AKA Haruto and Co), Main Character Haruto&#039;s Berserk moments until explanations about what they are and way to prevent them is found, Valvraves and main antagonist really are, along the Info what actually piloting Valvrave means and what it really does to their pilots, make shocking and jaw dropping surprises that keep viewer staring straight into their TV/Computers.<br />
<br />
Series final is quite fitting tough some annoying members of the pairing war may find it annoying.<br />
<br />
Overall series is very good enjoyment to watch and nice to watch. Highly recommended to all mecha fans to watch along with all anime fans and otakus.<br />
<br />
it also makes clear that if you don&#039;t fight for what you truly believe in with all your strength and skill, you will be striken down and will be left rot.

    Valvrave: The Liberator is an alternate history philosophical mecha melodrama set a thousand years into the future. They say time mends all wounds and indeed, in this future, Germany and Russia have united into a single country. The show follows a bunch of ordinary space students turned immortal vampire mecha pilots for the army of the independent &quot;our school&quot; moon colony as they wreak havoc thru the dyson sphere surrounding our sun in an attempt to reestablish the Russian monarchy.<br />
<br />
The show is insanely deep with symbolism and meaning, tackling various high concepts and taboo subjects. It tries to unify Plato&#039;s world of Ideal Forms with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272930">
        real life physics by postulating the existence of the smallest information particle that draws unimaginable power from meaning. The show goes even further by showing us how these particles could power fighting robots. Indeed, this anime shatters all physical paradigms. Not to slack off on the question of morality, the morally gray world of Valverape: The Penetrator asks us the question - what is the line separating sexual violation from consensual rape?<br />
<br />
As I watched L-Elf single handedly crash the whole Germano-Russian army in an attempt to free a captive alien princess and take down the Führer so Russian monarchy loyalists can reinstate their king, I knew this anime was something special. I mean, I thought this was supposed to be about proclaiming a space university into a country? No wait. It was actually a romantic comedy primarily? Huh. <br />
<br />
In any case, Vulvarape is a must see. You go House of Romanov, Germano-Russia needs its monarchy back! A true patrician&#039;s work and a true masterpiece.<br />
<br />
10/10

    From the beginning I starting to like this anime. Especially, at the second to the last espisode. But the thing is I don&#039;t like the part where most of them died. This anime has a good plot, except for the ending. I would really put this anime on my favorite, but I ruined just because of the ending. If the ending would be like Haruto confessed to Shoko or whatever or somehow it has a good ending, not the part that the valvrave pilots died. I would score this 10 if the pilots didn&#039;t died. It kind of a sad ending but the others are

    Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This, is the PERFECT image to describe my experience watching every episode of both seasons.<br />
Going into details about the story without spoiling things for this particular anime is pretty difficult.. Should you decide to give this series a try though, I have a little challenge for you!~<br />
<br />
- Try to predict what will happen in the next episode.<br />
<br />
I personally failed miserably at this challenge since this anime was so over-the-top XD<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s another way of looking at it:<br />
<br />
Season 1 - BAD<br />
Season 2 - Best possible ending to cover up all the bad stuff~<br />
<br />
If I were to criticize the story as I was watching the episodes one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158829">
        by one, I would be bashing this sooo much more, but looking back at the series as a whole, I actually enjoyed it! ^.^<br />
Sure - there were a couple unexplained things still left at the end, but nitpicking at tiny stuff like that is not my style.<br />
If I could compare this to a similar experience though, it felt like I was watching Higurashi all over again.<br />
As I was watching the episodes, I had no idea wtf was going on or what drug the script writer was taking as it seemed like he wanted to make this anime fit into every genre imaginable.<br />
Think about this for a second.. Highschool Vampires vs. Space Nazis...<br />
It all comes together at the end though... thankfully...<br />
There&#039;s just.. so much suffering XD<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be honest, the reason I went to watch this anime is because I kept seeing it being called, &quot;Valvrape the Penetrator&quot; everywhere, so that got me curious.. I&#039;m now part of the individuals who understand that reference...<br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
There&#039;s almost no backstory to any of the characters (HEAVY emphasis on, &quot;almost&quot; though), but I guess giving too much backstory would be pointless and a waste of time as you will find out should you decide to watch this~<br />
<br />
I really didn&#039;t grow attached to any of the characters though.. the goals they were fighting for, they&#039;re likability, just like.. everything about them, both protagonists and antagonists.<br />
They all just sort of... fade away... ;D<br />
<br />
There were a bunch of characters I just hated though..<br />
And the ONE character that I did like.. became irrelavent after a couple episodes.... TT.TT<br />
<br />
Music: 8/10<br />
The OST for this anime was almost non-existant and not memorable at all.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER!<br />
The opening songs on the other hand were AWESOME, especially S2&#039;s which I REALLY grew attached to<br />
Sung by T.M.Revolution! (Sang the Gundam SEED OP&#039;s, also lead singer of Abingdon Boys School)<br />
Switched to Dailymotion vids since YouTube took em down... Switch to HD for the full experience~<br />
<br />
[video=dailymotion;x19il4p]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x19il4p_kakumeiki-valvrave-op-ed-creditless_shortfilms[/video]<br />
<br />
[video=dailymotion;x16o71t]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x16o71t_2013-kakumeiki-valvrave-op2_shortfilms[/video]<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Of course Sunrise Studio gets perfect score for art.<br />
Didn&#039;t really like the Valvrave models though and thought they were OP, they looked like bugs... I&#039;m not a fan of bugs...<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
All in all, I gotta give this series this score. I mean, in the end it was a pretty joyfull ride full of wtf moments and laughter for me. Like it&#039;s hard to take the serious story seriously with all the shenanigans that goes on. But.. I liked it O.o<br />
Lots of people compared it to Gundam 00, but honestly, it&#039;s soo hard to top that anime. This was just a failed attempt IMO.<br />
Like, for argument&#039;s sake, let&#039;s say this series aired before 00 - the scores it would be getting would be A LOT higher, heck I might&#039;ve considered giving it a 10/10.<br />
But topping a masterpiece is such a hard thing to do~<br />
<br />
At the end, you just gotta sit back like me and think about it.. it wasn&#039;t that bad. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
FINAL RATE: 38/50 (S1 7/10, S2 8/10 on MAL)<br />
Some people would say these are generous scores for this series, but I feel like it&#039;s just right.<br />
If the ending wasn&#039;t so perfect, then the score would be a lot lower.<br />
It really closed the show for good, and I&#039;m both glad and confident that it will stay that way.<br />
With the trainwreck of S1, S2 was the most perfect ending this anime could have got.<br />
<br />
This gives me hope for more awesome works from Sunrise Studios~<br />
Though I heard Buddy Complex which is airing this season is pretty similar to this anime O.O<br />
Gulp.. We shall see...<br />
<br />
Reccomendations:<br />
<br />
- Code;Geass -<br />
Countless times throughout Valvrave, I was reminded of striking similarities to Code;Geass.<br />
L-Elf is pretty much LeLouche.<br />
<br />
- Mobile Suit Gundam 00 -<br />
The anime Valvrave was trying to beat.<br />
Gundam 00&#039;s story just flowed waayy smoother.<br />
<br />
- Guilty Crown -<br />
Highschool kids working together &quot;most of the time&quot; against the adult world.<br />
The reason can&#039;t get any more precise than that :/

    Kakumeiki Valvrave Second Season. The second season, was way more heartfelt then the first for reason I will not disclose. But, I noticed something completely different about this season then I did the first one, as the protagonists were more determined and willing to work together. To put up everything they had again the enemy of the world, as of those who were hiding among the shadows. As well as some betrayals and reuniting on both sides of the fence. This season, seemed kind of rushed, just a little bit. But, I think everything came together quite nicely towards the end. Such another great story
