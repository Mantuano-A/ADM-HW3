    It’s easy to dismiss a show like Harukana Receive at first glance. Look at the key visual, read the premise, and check out those preview promotional material. What do you see? If the answer involves girls in bikinis playing beach volleyball, then you would be 100% correct. As a competitive sport, Harukana Receive takes the idea of beach volleyball and transforms it into a meaningful competitive story to tell.<br />
<br />
Since its serialization in 2015, the manga has received only moderate attention but had enough value to be licensed in North America. I rarely ever heard of people talking about the manga though so I assume most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289574">
        people coming into this show to be fresh. I’ve only read parts of the manga but it shouldn’t be hard to realize what the show will be about. The obvious is the show will be composed entirely of beach episodes. However, if we take a deeper dive into this anime, then it should also be recognized that Harukana Receive is a very character driven story. Every episode pushes the characters to new heights and this series isn’t shy to bring out their best. <br />
<br />
The title “Harukana” is a portmanteau of two of the main characters in this series – Haruka Oozora and Kanata Higa. It makes sense too considering the significance of this character pair and their journey to become volleyball superstars. In the beginning, Haruka is fascinated by the beaches of Okinawa. It doesn’t take long for her to embrace the love of volleyball as she decides to team up with her cousin, Kanata. The first few episodes easily establishes the story’s premise and is easy to understand from the characters’ perspectives. We learn about both characters and their motivations. Haruka is presented as a very open minded girl and easy to make friends with. This is in contrast with Kanata, who shows a more reserved personality and keeps much to herself. Through flashback details, we learn that Kanata used to be an experienced volleyball player until a traumatic event caused her to resign. It is not until present day that Haruka is able to convince her to return to the sport again. The two makes an interesting pair because the way they supplement each other – Haruka’s height and Kanata’s experience. To say the least, his character pair will no doubt spark curiosity on how far they can make it in the big leagues.<br />
<br />
Throughout their journey, Haruka and Kanata also meets formidable rivals. The most prominent of these include the pair – Claire and Emily Thomas. In many ways, I see a parallel similarity between them to Haruka and Kanata. For instance, Haruka and Claire both possesses a playful personality with a very open mind. It didn’t surprise me that they quickly became friends either. Kanata is also similar to Emily as they have a more quiet nature and tends to be more reserved. Nonetheless, the show portrays the relationship of these four characters with friendship, rivalry, and respect. Deeper down into the story, we also meet other character pairs such as Narumi/Ayasa and Akari/Mai. The show makes it clear that some of these competitors are extremely talented such as the case with Narumi. Their accomplishments inspires Haruka to improve while also bringing back Kanata’s motivation to succeed. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t fully develop them enough and only gives us a glimpse of their potential. In other words, it’s not easy to get attached to the supporting cast compared to the main pair of Haruka and Kanata. Luckily, the Thomas siblings makes up for the void as they get a decent amount of screen time. The character chemistry they bring into the show is infectiously entertaining. Even their mother makes an appearance and through flashbacks, viewers will understand how they became the characters they are today. <br />
<br />
As a 1-cour show of only 12 episodes, it became a bit obvious that the anime had to make room to reserve for the plot. It’s unfortunate to say this but 12 episodes really isn’t enough to explore the show at its fullest. The tournament arc featuring Haruka and Kanata only shows their improvement as players but doesn’t fully capitalize on their potential. While the series does a decent job at making us care about the characters, not all of them really get their time to shine either. This issue could have been resolved if the anime had been 2-cour but alas, it was not meant to be. I also have to mention that the show can be a bit niche if you’re watching this for the wrong reasons. It’s very lighthearted with plenty of comedy and gags but also moments with emotional drama. In other words, Harukana Receive may appear to be a walking fan service but there’s much more to just the hot girls in swimsuits.<br />
<br />
If I told you Okinawa is one of the most beautiful places on Earth today, you’d probably point fingers and name something else better. However, I will say that Okinawa is extremely well crafted with the vibrant colorful sunny atmosphere and realistic sandy landscape. The aquatic ocean also feels real that injects more of the Summer feeling. As this show aired during Summer 2018, it’s a perfect place to be. To get the more obvious out of the way, every character in the show will be in swimsuits for a good majority of the time. There are some episodes that characters spend in casual wear but most of it will be on the sandy beaches of Okinawa. What does this mean? It basically means that you’d better get used to seeing ass, boobs, and curvy bodies on your screen. It doesn’t help that the camera seems to always focus on the character’s bodies too so get used to that. There are even comedic gags where some characters slap another’s ass as a way of expressing their personalities. Still, it’s definitely also a good idea to keep an eye on the body movements of the show during the volleyball matches. Every movement in the show feels important whether it’s a dive, block, or close save. It emphasizes character teamwork that’s as real as it gets. In fact, I would say the character pairs in the show are portrayed much more than just partners. They feel like are destined to be together whether it’s Haru-Kana or the Thomas siblings. <br />
<br />
As colorful as the show is on the surface, also be prepared to be dazzled by the energetic soundtrack. It creates the sensation of being in the sunny fields of Okinawa. Every match in the show also gets an enhanced experience with the OST matching its intense momentum. The theme songs are also catchy that emphasizes on character pairings. Last and certainly not least are the character voice mannerisms. Characters like Kanata and Emily really bring themselves to life and it’s easy to accept them who they are.<br />
<br />
Harukana Receive seems like a deceptive show that glorifies fan service and makes it look like an eyecandy for the male audience. However, if you look beyond the skin and swimsuits, it’s easy to see how well this show works with its ideas. Do be aware that as a show with just 12 episodes, it will feel incomplete. And also, some characters will feel less likable than others. However, I would definitely recommend adding this show to the watchlist. It’s not easy to make a show as a walking fan service but Harukana Receive does more than just being sexy.

    This show is filled with all kinds of disgusting and cringe-worthy elements of the most vile kind, things that will make your skin crawl, including but not limited to: <br />
<br />
-Fan service (oh god, the horror)<br />
-Sexy ladies in bikinis (ugh!)<br />
-Yuri moments (No, please, no!)<br />
-VOLLEYBALL (NOOOOOO)<br />
<br />
...but you know, it turns out that crazy people like me greatly enjoy all of those despicable things, and if you do too, this is probably a show for you! <br />
<br />
Satire aside, Harukana Receive is a competent show. My opinion on the show has not changed since I originally wrote this review; from an ecchi perspective, the girls are all very attractive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284929">
        and, much like Keijo, the show has found a good excuse to get the audience their fan service in copious amounts without needing to push the believability out almost at all. <br />
<br />
The story is nothing particularly spectacular, though the general framework of girls playing beach volleyball works perfectly well in serving its efforts to develop the characters. Two episodes in, we had an understanding of where each girl was coming from, their relationships to each other, and what the general drama was between them. That main story is retained as the main focus in future episodes while gradually introducing new characters, which is enough for me to consider it competent, especially since dramatic narrative is (and perhaps even should be) used a plot-mover more than a feature in these types of works.<br />
<br />
I would say the main things to like about this show are generally obvious to any respectable ecchi fan, particularly all of the things I listed at the beginning of this review. As far as whether non-ecchi fans would enjoy this, I would say the girls&#039; cute personalities, decent artwork, and the sports aspect could certainly be appealing enough to make this an enjoyable watch. However, if you actively dislike fan service, this is not a show for you.<br />
<br />
Some other things of note that may sway your opinion one way or the other:<br />
<br />
-The show appears to be all-girls. At this moment in time, the only male is a pet turtle.<br />
<br />
-Because of the first point, it should come as no surprise that the girls are occasionally flirty with each other with potential for actual yuri to occur (though we all know how that usually turns out in shows like this)<br />
<br />
-Things move fairly quickly so far in terms of the main girl&#039;s improvement at the sport; probably the writers opting to focus more on the characters in the 12 episodes they have. However, what we&#039;ve seen so far in terms of actual volleyball matches have been pretty fun to watch.<br />
<br />
tl;dr I definitely recommend this show for ecchi fans who like an all-girl cast. Non-ecchi fans may get enjoyment out of the cute (though tropey) characters and the sports aspect, however I do not recommend this show if fan service is something you dislike.

    I&#039;m not sure why this anime is ranked so low. Without taking my personal entertainment into consideration, I believe this anime should be a solid 7.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s been a MAJOR lack of representation of women in sports animes. So when I saw Harukana Receive and Hanebado coming out this season, I was so excited! I had low expectations going in, especially with the ecchi genre tacked on to it, but I&#039;m having a great time so far. <br />
<br />
The animation is absolutely gorgeous!! The sand particles are animated to perfection and the different camera angles help to capture the difficulty and excitement of this sport. Even if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285114">
        the story was crap (which it&#039;s not), the animation alone makes this anime a treat to watch. <br />
<br />
The voice acting and music in the anime is nice, with some numbers shining more than others. I wouldn&#039;t say any of the music&#039;s going to end up on my playlist, but it&#039;s pleasant and adds to the scenes.<br />
<br />
Despite one of the genres being listed as an ecchi, there is a surprisingly minimal amount of fanservice. I&#039;m not sure if this will increase as we continue, but I kind of doubt it as the anime has set itself up to be mainly about volleyball and character development/relationships. I know, surprising right? A sports anime with women as protagonists that is ACTUALLY about the sport they&#039;re playing?? Revolutionary. <br />
<br />
Now mind you, yes, there is fan service. There are butts and boobs, and they do wear bikinis. But all of this is pretty normal in beach volleyball. Now just hear me out...<br />
<br />
As someone who&#039;s played court and beach volleyball for about 11 or 12 years now (and participated in both tournaments and school matches), I can positively say that this anime is surprisingly accurate to beach volleyball. Yes, we wear bikinis when we play. Yes, we do tend to wear tighter bottoms and tops so everything stays in place better. And yes, we get to pick the matching bikinis we want to wear so it can be as conservative (if a bikini can be that) or scandalous as the pair wants. I was excited to see how much accurate information was given about the sport from the outfits to the actual rules and shots themselves. You can actually learn a lot about beach volleyball and how to play it from this anime.<br />
<br />
I also love how it&#039;s women playing beach volleyball. I have loved both volleyball and anime from a young age, so I&#039;ve been waiting for a volleyball anime with women in it for a very long time. We got Haikyuu, which I was happy about, but was still frustrated with because they even made it a conflict in the beginning how their middle school didn&#039;t have a men&#039;s volleyball team because it&#039;s such a female dominated sport. So if mainly women play it, why not have a sports anime about women instead?<br />
<br />
Overall, I believe this anime deserves more love. It has surprisingly minimal fan service but plentiful and accurate information about beach volleyball. I think this anime will surprise people with it&#039;s focus on character development and the relationship development between the pairs. People who want to enjoy an anime with gorgeous animation about how some girls love playing beach volleyball while learning about beach volleyball with the main character as she develops into a full-fledged player, and doesn&#039;t mind a little fan service along the way, should watch Harukana Receive.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: After finishing Harukana Receive, I still stand by most of this review. The animation was pretty with some exceptions, that being episode 7&#039;s terrible CGI. Around episode 7 is when it got a bit cringy and they seemed to rush the story. I much would have preferred to see them training, honing in on new tricks and techniques, and doing practice matches or smaller tournaments before the prelims. Some of what I liked in the beginning got lost because of this rush. That on top of ep 7 and some cringy moments made me drop my score down to a 7. I still enjoyed watching this anime though, especially since it picked back up at the end with the prelims. I just wish the whole anime could have been as good as that last match. Still recommend it to those who enjoy watching girls develop as characters through beach volleyball.<br />

    &quot;Anything can be better if there are hot anime girls in it.&quot; - Cultured gentleman, Agent_Redacted <br />
<br />
There are countless anime with fanservice. As an edgy individual, I for the most part find them idiotic and inarticulately retarded as they do nothing more but satisfy one&#039;s lecherous desires. In any case, does that really suggest that all types of fanservice are bad? That’s what I always thought until I watched Harukana Receive. A hidden gem, and in all likelihood one of the best sports anime I’ve ever watched. <br />
<br />
Harukana Receive has a straightforward and simple story. Girls playing beach volleyball competitively. In spite of the fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343982">
        that the story is simple I find the concept of it quite captivating as an exceptionally cultured individual. Harukana Receive has a fanservice which is unique in contrast to a large portion of anime with fanservice out there. This sort of fanservice Harukana Receive has is rarely used however it very well could potentially be very viable on the off chance that it could to be used quite effectively. I call this the &quot;natural fanservice&quot;. Allow me to clarify the differences between a typical and a natural fanservice. <br />
<br />
Typically an ordinary fanservice comprises of perverted shots and abundance of one&#039;s perversion acts. For example, grabbing a girl’s boobs and zooming in to see the hands diving and digging profoundly into her Schwerer Gustav-typed cannon as she makes an irregular, abnormal sound that stimulates ( arouses ) the majority of the hormone-uncontrollable men who are or were watching the scene. However, for a natural fanservice :  <br />
<br />
Rather than causing it to feel like an &quot;excess&quot; it feels more &quot;natural&quot; henceforth &quot;natural fanservice&quot;. Well sure, now and then the camera angles and zooming can be equivalent to a normal fanservice but a natural fanservice’s fanservice feels more natural. It doesn&#039;t stand out as much as a normal fanservice, making it natural. This may sound bad already, but I can assure you that it is excellent and well done. It doesn&#039;t really drive individuals into arousal states but instead allows oneself to choose if we ought to get stimulated or not. There&#039;s a decision and you can choose whether to think about one or another. Thus it is good. <br />
<br />
Another beneficial thing about Harukana Receive is the fact that it has Yuri baits. A considerable amount and enough for an anime that is not categorized as Yuri. The amount is right and I can detect it unmistakably. This anime has some great Yuri baits, I tell you.<br />
<br />
The other good thing about Harukana Receive is it&#039;s really not that awful as a Slice of life. No doubt, the main character’s development feels somewhat like it&#039;s too rushed but generally speaking it&#039;s actually acceptable as a CGDCT SoL. Furthermore, despite the fact that Harukana Receive is a sports anime it&#039;s just girls. Girls everywhere. And we all cultured men know that if there are hot anime girls anything can become better.<br />
<br />
The art and quality is also excellent. That is fine. Nothing to say. The sound is additionally acceptable. That is also fine. Nothing to say. What about the characters? <br />
<br />
Well obviously, with sports anime there&#039;ll certainly be drama. And yes this anime does not escape from the sports drama. But bruh, c&#039;mon. A part of the joy from watching a sports anime is from the drama. If you can&#039;t even take that then why even watch a sports anime in the first place. Okay, I&#039;m going off a little bit now. So I&#039;m saying that there is drama between characters. That&#039;s about it. Other than that, the character designs are good, the character developments are slightly cliche because of the 12-episode-rush-cliche but I think that it wasn&#039;t that bad for a 12 episode SoL sports anime. All in all there&#039;s not really anything wrong with the characters.<br />
<br />
I made some incredible memories watching this show. Tragically it ended quite fast. You don&#039;t have a clue how many times I screamed during the last episode. Haha, it was marvelous. <br />
<br />
Recommended to the individuals who desire a touch of fanservice ( not over the top ) as well as individuals who are looking for a CGDCT ( technically ) and sports drama ( a little ).<br />

    *This review is completely tasteless, and should not be read by anyone*<br />
<br />
There is something very visually pleasing when it comes to women playing volleyball. Watching how cute, sportic ladies give their best in highly sportsmanship-like sport while occasionally hugging each others or falling over each others and &quot;accidentally&quot; groping some tits while doing so, is definitely the core of any sports.<br />
<br />
However, Harukana Receive is about beach volleyball, which is a bit different from normal volleyball because you play it on sand, outdoors, in pairs of two, and apparently make cute anime girl sounds whenever hitting the ball. This show is not a masterpiece of ecchi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284885">
        like Keijo is, nor a beastiality wish fulfillment like Uma Musume, but hits the fanservice bucket with sexy women wearing bikini so hard it could as well be the censored version of both hentai series: Fault and Nudist Beach. <br />
<br />
The characters are incredible. The other one is a tall girl with big boobs and the another short girl with small boobs. Since it&#039;s a 2 person game, this is clearly the best route when it comes to design. I am personally prepared to receive just about anything from any of them.. possibly even volleyballs. Both of them do have personalities, and are supposed to be friends, but they prove to be quite distant. Then they discover this sport and start becoming closer. This is a pretty good excuse for the series, tbh, and it&#039;s been handled in rather comfy manner which serves the atmosphere for sure. <br />
<br />
The approach of our ecchi fanservice is respectable. If you are watching this show for what it is, there is little to no reason to criticize it for its content. For one, all our cast is fun to follow, and moreover, their personalities are always prioritized over their sexy bodies. For that matter, Harukana Receive has done good choices. None of our characters is a nympho. They all are sports ladies whose favorite past time is indeed playing beach volleyball and not sucking dicks. I approve. <br />
<br />
The art is beyond bright, and has a real summer feel to it. Lot is put in consideration when the games take place at the beach. The water is constantly present, the bikinis are pretty, and same can be said about the skin of our girls. As a person who has been rewarded with a fetish for tanlines, I am hyped. All of these bring out the sexiness --that this show promotes-- rather well. The weirdest part is how they manage to play any of it without wearing sunglasses.<br />
<br />
As a conclusion, watching those balls bounce all-around might shock some viewers, so I would rather recommend watching this anime instead of watching me watch the anime.

    Harukana Receive does something really special within its 12 episodes. A show with outstanding characters as well as terrific matches. But most importantly it portrays the true elegance and beauty of beach volleyball. Although less about the &quot;Xs and Os&quot; of the sport, it does something that makes you relate and resonate with the passion and intensity the sport can be.<br />
<br />
Starting off, the story is pretty straightforward. Nothing to write home about. But it works. It allows each character regardless of their screen time to shine. It is definitely a character driven show.<br />
<br />
The characters are an absolutely gem. Every single one you meet is an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289620">
        absolute delight to watch. They are all add something to the cast (although some more quickly than others) It is a debate on who the &quot;MC&quot; really is, but for the most part, it follows Haruka and how she grew both as a volleyball player and as a person throughout the show. She was a typical scrub when things started out, but the way she and many others matured was amazing. <br />
<br />
OP and ED are solid. OST really shines in the middle of matches though. Art style is pretty good. Excellent use of closeups and pan outs in matches. As for the ecchi element, it is prevalent, but never takes away from the moment. <br />
<br />
Can&#039;t recommend this show enough. Never a dull moment as every scene feels like it is building towards the finale (which was absolutely excellent) A ton of comedy in here as well. This show is just about having a good time. Don&#039;t expect convoluted drama or anything similar. It is the bonds of the characters as well as terrific beach volleyball that make this show a must watch of the 2018 Summer season.

    Sports-centric anime are nothing new: For said game, you know the sport, you know the rules, competition ensues and some character development got misfired or screwed hard in the process towards the end, just like a certain badminton anime this season.<br />
<br />
For this reason alone, Harukana Receive attempts to add the CGDCT aspect to the sports genre, while giving us the SoL view and despite THAT &quot;Ecchi&quot; tag, there is minimal fanservice to be found (some yuri moments, butt slaps, bouncing boobs and whatnot) that can actually rave wee bits of enjoyment. The end result is an anime that is telling us to just sit back

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289578">
        and relax, and watch this while not taking it seriously. Quite honestly, it&#039;s a somewhat competent show that while only bears very minimal similarity towards its male-gender focused cousin (Haikyuu!) in terms of the sport represented (it&#039;s volleyball, only on the beach instead of in school), it&#039;s pretty much its own story and context while representing the female-gender side.<br />
<br />
Harukana Receive is, dare I say, an average generic show with nothing to offer but with its busty-boobie girls that kinda resembled like Keijo!!!!! in terms of storytelling and character development. The only kicker that deviates from the norm is the aforementioned CGDCT light-hearted cliche, where characters spend time practicing and motivating each other through their early struggles to make their time spent worthwhile with improving competency. Nothing groundbreaking, but yet stands out like a sore thumb.<br />
<br />
This series tells the story (and progressing growth) of 2 (largely-focused MC) girls :<br />
Haruka Oozora, with said troupe of a transfer student (and you can toss that out by the end of Episode 1 because there&#039;s no follow-up) and a total beginner towards beach volleyball;<br />
Kanata Higa, the experienced player and pro-status enough to play at competitions, but her waning confidence setting off the chain of events, that cost her to question her motives for playing the sport and recapturing the passion of beach volleyball once again.<br />
<br />
So first off, the elephant in the room lies in the story, which isn&#039;t really compelling to warrant proceeding episodes, because of a certain scriptwriter: Touko Machida. Her works include the cheap knock-off that is Dive! and the decently-made Akashic Records, to which the stories feel somewhat rushed and/or missing some plot pointers that leaves more questions than answers unanswered. Even going in with the first few episodes, the resemblance to aforementioned series clearly shows, and that doesn&#039;t get any better with proceeding episodes, right until the final moments of the series. But this is still an effort that&#039;s worth somewhat better than how Keijo!!!!! did.<br />
<br />
As for character development, there are a few and then some.<br />
Main girls duo Haruka and Kanata (that&#039;s why said title is called Harukana) are basically plot pointers, the anchors to show us viewers that they are not just stepping stones by the others who are willing to see them that way, and persistently with their step-by-step building-up of efforts, they made it count towards the end while having some light Yuri moments with each other.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast are the direct contrast to Harukana: plot movers along a not-so-aggressive storyline.<br />
<br />
Narumi Tooi, once worked with Kanata as junior pros before Kanata lost her footing and made Narumi become another Ayano (losing at the finals). Unwilling to forgive her partner and (somehow) reasoning with Kanata&#039;s progress that she was &quot;too harsh&quot; on her and simply couldn&#039;t take her on after the whole fiasco. And with time comes healing, and finally, recognition that both herself and Kanata are polar opposites.<br />
<br />
The Thomas sisters, Claire and Emily, the example to follow and Harukana&#039;s coach before the next competition arc. This part is easier to discern as hard work makes up for the amount of talent that they have, winning competition after competition and offering both girlish MCs constant practical tips and tricks before the direct confrontation at the end of the series (spoiler alert...).<br />
<br />
Last but not least, the somewhat late addition to the team, Akari Ooshiro, a high-school idol that&#039;s famous from a certain CM that comes forward to join the 4 girls for the school beach volleyball club (of which not surprisingly there&#039;s no progression to it thereafter), and is there to maintain good relations between Harukana and the Thomas sisters, and why not albeit learn some beach volleyball as well!<br />
<br />
Overall, where there&#039;s good moments, the bad moments reside in as a ripple effect that not everyone has sweet rosy lives to deal with, and the repercussions (or stakes) are significant towards the growth of others, blemishing all that passion into something that will either make or break the characters.<br />
<br />
The one thing I am able to give credit for this show is with the insane amount to detail for both the art and animation. This is studio C2C&#039;s comeback work in over 4 years as the lead studio (other than co-production with Satelight for SukaSuka in Spring 2017), and credits to director Toshiyuki Kubooka from the expertise of his work on the Berserk: The Golden Age trilogy of movies. The attention to detail from the beautiful, gorgeous and striking 2D background art scenes, to the clean CGI volleyball movements and sand-hit markings from the matches, just makes this appealing to the quality elitists like myself for good art and animation. But as we all know, one good area doesn&#039;t make up for the rest of the shortcomings of this show.<br />
<br />
The music however, it&#039;s really meh, hell, I thought it could be better. Most VAs (with the exception of Claire&#039;s VA, Atsumi Tanezaki) are new and upcoming seiyuus, especially Kanata&#039;s VA (her very first TV anime work). Despite all that, the light-hearted aspect of the show makes the OST more appealing to those who just want to have a laid-back experience. I think this is a decent job done as it pretty much describes the series in the utmost generalist of terms.<br />
<br />
Despite that insane &quot;low&quot; score from MAL (which I think is a lenient joke), is it a great watch though? Hell yes it is...only if you don&#039;t see this at face-value, and adding to that, the fanservice intensity, of which there are few.<br />
<br />
Harukana Receive is not a show for everyone, with its minimalistic approaches yet solid animation production that divides the audience all around. If you can put up with the rushed storyline and yet watch the characters grow from strength to strength, I say go for it, it&#039;s a good time.

    I love a good CGDCT. If you were to look through all of my favorites and the shows I rank highly you would find a lot of CDCGT that I gave a high score to. I also like sports shows and find them as a good way to get hype and experience the highs and lows of competition without the negative ramifications of death or other dark results like with some shounen. A pairing between the two seems odd and when combined with the echii tag there are a lot of distinct parts that are mixed together. And while I think it can be done

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289596">
        well sadly Harukana Reviece missed the mark.<br />
<br />
The show starts off with drama and while I did like the drama it had and the exploration of the characters it provided it did pose a problem. Part of the joy of a CGDCT is the cute meaningless antics that the characters get into and while there were some, there wasnt enough for the genre it was in. Furthermore because the start was drama and the end consisted of 3 episodes worth of one match this led the show to be strapped on time. In fact it pretty much did a time skip askewing a lot the more SOL moments to get to the volleyball.<br />
<br />
While the volleyball was good, it made the show feel incomplete. While it talks a lot about the strength of the characters bonds and relies a lot on attachment to the characters, it&#039;s hard to get the true feeling of attachment when many of those attachment gaining moments were breezed over. The problem is sports anime tend to be long and focus a lot on moments of high tension. While this can work with CGDCT if they alternate, they both need time in order to shine. And for this combo one cour isnt enough. Not if both peaks are to be fit in well. And while the matches were nicely animated and fun to watch, the tournament structure was boring and really only one match had all of the tension. Not to mention the way that, that match came about was lackluster imo. While the idea behind it was good I felt like it was forced to happen sooner due to time and increased drama more than anything else.<br />
<br />
The characters did have some good motivations and the starting idea was great. I liked the development of Kanata, and how she was able to overcome her previous shortcomings and get out of her funk, but the rest of the characters really could have used some more time to focus on them. Their initial characterization was promising but for the show to do what it wanted to do well I feel like more would have been helpful.<br />
<br />
Overall there&#039;s a lot of good ideas in Harukana Reviece and the fanservice and visuals are nice, but in the end the pacing let&#039;s it down and I&#039;m left wishing it had two cours to properly explore its ideas. It&#039;s still a good show but ultimately leaves with promise it couldn&#039;t capitalize on.

    So being honest, when I went into this show I was expecting it to be a full-on fanservice machine until I was quickly proven wrong in that it has a well-grounded story behind it. Seriously, job well done by making me love the characters by the end of the first episode. <br />
<br />
Not only does this anime have a story, but it explains how its sport is played by having us go through the experience that the main character had to go through as well. Another job well done. <br />
<br />
In all, this series is definitely worth a watch. It combines fanservice, story, cast, art, and an

For you &quot;quality&quot; gentlemen out there, yes, the main character does have a gorgeous ass.

    Fanservice in anime doesn&#039;t really bother me with some few exceptions. This wasn&#039;t too bad I guess. It&#039;s a beach volleyball anime after all. What really bothered me and made me drop this anime was the tone shifting. I don&#039;t know why but this anime always has the worst timing when changing the atmosphere in a given situation. One moment everything is normal then a melodramatic moment (mostly backstory) is brought up then all the suddenly something unneccesary comedic thing will happen.... I mean come on at least keep the tone of the scene last longer than just 2-3 minutes besides the actual game which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285161">
        also has some weird back story mixed into them why character a can/can&#039;t do a certain thing during the match.

    My reason for my review score is that the intense showdowns in the matches were honestly very well done. Slowdowns were a bit overused but that adds to the dramatic effect. It gives me the Haikyuu vibes honestly. Of course there are a lot of &quot;ecchi&quot; scenes but that comes with a show based off of beach volleyball. There are a lot of things I wish could&#039;ve been changed of course but a very well made sports anime and highly recommend it. <br />

There were a lot of people commenting about the beginners luck of Harukana, but keep in mind that she was a transfer who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299335">
        was pretty athletic as well as she was given tons of training before the tournament. Realistically of course she shouldn&#039;t be pwning everyone but that&#039;s anime for ya! ;)

    +*+* WARNING THIS IS WORDY+*+* <br />
<br />
<br />
this &quot;sports&quot; / Slice of Life anime is honestly disappointing. it was like training a whole season in volleyball just to loose the first match. <br />
<br />
the anime tries to do a sudo tournament arc but it falls FLAT on its face this anime has 6 other character that are not the main character in a sports anime that&#039;s a VERY BAD THING even if they were not thoroughly fleshed out it would have been nice to see at least double that number....<br />
<br />
moving on the characters don&#039;t change that much over the story they stay un interesting till the very end

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377159">
         learn new moves and / or evolve there style and EARN the win<br />
<br />
 i mean the last match has two i repeat TWO flashbacks. remember your fav FINAL fight where there&#039;s two flash backs in a short and UN-eventful  fight. me too <br />
<br />
<br />
i would rank this lower but the person i watched  this with seemed to like it so it goes from a 3 to a 4 <br />
{for context i watched this weekly with a cool homie  and expected something more that tits on screen}

    All the characters have excellent chemistry!  Haruka and Kanata are absolutely cool.  The character progression is great.  At first there isn&#039;t much to be concerned about, or feel passion for, but then they start their rounds of volleyball and everything changes.   Seeing a low-stress sports world open up for Haruka is amazing.  Her happiness and enthusiasm are contagious. She revitalizes her cousin and together they learn from each other and build friendships.  Opposing teams have backstories that show the dynamics of every match, and everyone finds each other&#039;s strengths and plays to them.  It&#039;s epic.<br />

    Harukana Recieve is one of those relaxing, fun, lighthearted sports anime that captures what beach volleyball should be about! A group of cute girls in their swimsuits playing the game they love at the beach. No execces drama, bad sportsmanship or bitchy rivalry (coughs Hanebado). <br />
<br />
Plot: 7<br />
The plot is simple and the characters may not be the most complex, however I feel this show does a lot of things well. <br />
<br />
The story is about a transfer student Haruka and her ex pro cousin Kanata, who used to play volleyball after some circumstances. It’s not long till Haruka embraces her newfound love for beach volleyball and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289585">
        convinces Kanata to step back on the sand again and team up with her to form the beach volleyball pair, Harukana.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
The characters are all distinctive, memorable and receive a decent amount of character development. The show especially deals well with Kanata’s past, her relationship with Narumi and the reason she stopped playing volleyball.<br />
<br />
Animation: 8<br />
The animation was great. Theres some great close ups of volleyball shots. I appreciate the use of slow mo’s, but I think they’re should have been a lot less as it slowed the pace of the match at times. <br />
<br />
Sounds: 8<br />
The opening and osts are fun, energetic and lively which work perfectly for a sports anime about beach volleyball.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
I’ve always said Harukana receive is like the spirit sister of Haikyuu! I enjoyed this show a lot. The matches were a lot more intense than I thought they would be. I have no idea how the writer is going to be able to top Harukana Vs Eclair because it had the perfect balance of everything that makes a great match.<br />
<br />
The fanservice didn’t really bother me. Call me perv, but I love all the tits and ass shots xD. It never distracted me from the match.<br />
<br />
PS: Claire is best girl xD

    Don&#039;t let the fan service discourage you from giving this show a try. Harukana Receive is more than just that.<br />
<br />
What makes Harukana Receive different from other sports anime this season is that it&#039;s light and fun to watch. This is one of those shows that I&#039;d like to watch after a tiring day or when I just want to watch something and relax.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t complicated but it&#039;s definitely not shallow. The characters are lovable. While we often see them just enjoying beach volleyball, we also get to see the competitive side of it and see how different characters react to the frustrations of losing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289672">
        Definitely, one of the good points of this anime in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll have to give credit to C2C and other involved studios for the art. The way they portrayed Okinawa, it&#039;s very vibrant. It makes you want to visit the place. The atmosphere definitely feels like Summer.<br />
<br />
On the informative side, you get to learn a number of jargon in beach volleyball. People who don&#039;t know anything about volleyball are being introduced to different terms like &#039;cut shot&#039; and &#039;pokey&#039;.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack also fits very well with the show. Kadokawa just released the soundtrack preview for the show and it was great.<br />
<br />
Now, some people might get discouraged because of the fan service of the show. But these called &quot;fan service&quot; aren&#039;t even presented in a perverted way. It&#039;s sexy and cute, but it doesn&#039;t present the characters as something that exists just for fan service.<br />
<br />
If you just want to watch a light and easy to watch anime without some over complicated plot or some cringe-worthy characters, then go ahead and give this show a try.

    I personally like this anime. If you look past the ecchi zoom-ins and treat it as a sports anime, it&#039;s actually not that bad. Heck, I&#039;d even consider removing the ecchi tag. The characters are cute and have a decent head on their shoulders, and the sports action animation is decent (the ball animation seems iffy to me). Character development is shown through skill improvement and we are shown their efforts through their trainings and matches. The anime also focuses on the dynamics of beach volleyball - on how it is (should be) played, the tactics involved, and its difference from typical indoor volleyball. Overall,

    When they titled this &quot;Harukana Receive&quot; original creator  Nyoi, Jizai knows exactly whats he is making, and  yes it&#039;s about a city slicker Haruka Oozora and a former beach volleyball aficionado who already hanged up her mantle , Kanata Higa, who found themselves competing in a beach volleyball tournament with the latter finding himself going back to the very sport that she used to play before with her former partner, Tooi Narumi, Though &quot;receive&quot; maybe a volleyball term, here (be it in the manga or anime) it also means that they receive the mantle of being Japan&#039;s best in the sport of Beach

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289610">
        Volleyball. However , let us not forget , that this was aired in the summer, when the beaches were in and the bikinis were hot, and them characters being in their hot 2 piece swimsuit was basically a sight for sore eyes for them fans who has a thing for 2D characters in such outfit and as much as it disgust me Claire Thomas gets high marks followed by Haruka whom was in her plaint bikini. So basically, this has little to do with beach volleyball, since there were scene here that seemly in violation of the laws of physics and one move in particularly of kicking the ball would penalize the player, so whatever knowledge that original creator Nyoi, Jizai has about the sport of beach volleyball were probably just as usual as anyone would know based on what they watch, so let&#039;s just stop pretending since this was just all about the bikinis, boobies, asses and the bodies , nothing else. Now. c&#039;mon that&#039;s what everyone enjoys , so regardless, of what other reviews says , it just all about them beach bodies , cu&#039;z real life beach volleyball players don&#039;t have hot bodies like we see here, it&#039;s either them real life beach volleyball players bodies were skinny or a bit muscular or a times a bit chubby, so without further adieu, here&#039;s how I see it:<br />
<br />
Story-Good 7: since it combines two things, a city girl who enters the world of beach volleyball in order to make it big and her partner forced to come back to the sports that she already quit, and the two buxom American girls whose serves as the wall that the two have to overcome. <br />
<br />
Art-Outstanding 10 : based on ny bikini ratings:<br />
<br />
Clare Thomas,  Ayasa Tachibana,Thomases Mom and Haruka Oozora: Outstanding 10<br />
<br />
Emily Thomas: Great 9, if it weren&#039;t for the glasses. <br />
<br />
Kanata Higa: Good 7, for her ass.<br />
<br />
Narumi Tooi: fair 6, she has the ass, but up there is flat as a pancake.<br />
<br />
Akari Oshiro: Poor 3, wtf, her bikini was a disaster, cu&#039;z she looks more like a 70&#039;s whore. <br />
<br />
 Mai Sunagawa and Ai Tanahara and others, well they ain&#039;t bad.<br />
<br />
Sound-fair 6: No Comment here, thought it was nice to hear from seiyuu Itou Kanade  again, I wonder what she&#039;s been up to lately????<br />
<br />
Character Good 7: Well, to see Haruka being this bubbly cheerful character was nice, but she can be annoying sometimes, when she becomes a pitbull when she finds something interesting and drags someone else with her in the process. Kanata Higa on the other hand, we know that she quits playing beach volleyball, but it seems that studio C2C didn&#039;t mention as to why did she quit playing.....The Thomas sisters on the other hand were something else but I kinda hate that they have faced off with their former protege only to loose to them, I would have prefered that they&#039;ve faced off with Narumi and Ayase and the loose to them, where Haruka and Kanata avenges them and won, that would have been a good ending....Now , Akari Ooshiro, to me I find her more as an excess baggage whom was put as a mere errand girl than a manger, in fact, I would have preferred that she be one of the players who was partnered with either  Mai Sunagawa or Ai Tanahara. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-fair 6: It&#039;s just all about the beach bodies and nothing else. <br />
<br />
Overall- fair 6: To those bikini fanservices fans out there, ENJOY!!!!!!!!!      <br />
<br />

    Let’s get this out of the way now...I started watching this show simply for the fan service and because, in general, I love any sports anime. However, I continued watching this show because the story and action were really well done and hooked me in to the experience. <br />
<br />
This show isn’t anything ground breaking in terms of visuals but the action looks fairly intense and the designs are honestly great. Lots of simple things made me like the style from the eyes to the girls themselves and even the sky summer atmosphere. <br />
<br />
The story is a slight twist on a beginner suddenly getting good through

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289628">
        trial and error, which is nice. They add in a cousin who had previously played and suffered hardship. I think this helps the girls grow together and become a great pair. I like the aspect of having a rival at the top and having the second best teach them to get there. <br />
<br />
This anime isn’t without flaws though. I felt they spent too much time with the bonding of characters sometimes with random scenes and an introduction to a girl later in the show felt completely unnecessary, minus one plot point. I felt this time could’ve been better showing the progress of the girls to make their jump in power more believable. I say this because they seemingly get super OP with a beginner in a matter of months which frankly makes no sense. <br />
<br />
I felt more connected later in the show with the Emily and Claire pair because of their background stories and how they helped along our MC pair. The match between the two to go to nationals was great and I honestly didn’t know who would win or who to root for. I really wish I could get more of this especially with the ending scenes.

    Harukana Receive fits into a really weird storytelling narrative and manages to simultaneously tow two dichotomous lines. <br />
<br />
Is this a story about beach volleyball that features girls in bikinis and all the obvious fanservice tropes and camera angles that come with it? Yes. Is this a story about people overcoming obstacles, both past, present and from within and external forces? Also yes. <br />
<br />
Outside of this the story is visually gorgeous, I particularly found myself falling in love with the over embellishment on the eyes and hair. <br />
<br />
About the only major elements where this story falls flat is sound and character. The beach volleyball sounds used

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293773">
        are solid, but definitely sound synthetic compared to the rest of the animes more organic sounding elements. The characters, while also solid do somewhat fall flat into typically overused tropes of &quot;tragic back story.&quot; It&#039;s not too tropey as to prevent enjoyment or make you roll your eyes, but it&#039;s there. <br />
<br />
The fact that Harukana Receive provides both a level of fanservice one would expect and on top of it having an very touching story is nothing short of a miracle, but it leads to one of the most refreshingly unique anime I have found myself watching in a long time. Especially given I ALMOST wrote it off because of the fan-service shots. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t, and I hope you won&#039;t either.<br />

    I watch these sorts of fan service sports anime when I am bored, tired, eating, or simply need something to fill the time and don&#039;t want to watch something that is driven by a meaningful story with interesting characters and plot. Fan service does not bother me when done correctly, and let&#039;s be honest if you&#039;re interested in watching this anime you&#039;re primarily interested in the girls in bikinis playing sports. <br />
<br />
**Review may contain spoilers**<br />
The problem with Harukana Receive is that the main characters are very unlikeable. Haruka is annoyingly good at everything. She improves at such an unreasonable rate that it feels sad watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393245">
        her begin to outshine and dominate girls who have given their lives to this sport. Kanata on the other hand is a girl who ran away from the sport, abandoning the &#039;friend&#039; Narumi who she made a promise with to become national champions. Then, she easily returns to the sport with Haruka, and what&#039;s her way of apologizing to Narumi? &quot;I&#039;ll keep my promise, but this time with Haruka.&quot; This apology genuinely made me want to vomit and this is when this show went from an okay sports anime with decently attractive girls and fanservice to a show I struggled to finish. I then had to watch them somehow overcome Emily and Claire, who were kind enough to train them, in order to finish season 1. Watching Emily and Claire get defeated felt awful. It would have been better to have the main characters lose and for once be humbled. <br />
<br />
The best part of this anime is the side characters. Narumi, Ayasa, Emily, and Claire. They&#039;re likable characters who work hard to earn their talent over years of practice and dedication. Narumi is especially the best girl and is the only one who actually looks the part. Unfortunately, The main characters ruin this anime. <br />

Story 2/10<br />
Art 5/10<br />
Sound 5/10<br />
Character 2/10<br />
Enjoyment 3/10<br />
Overall 3/10<br />
