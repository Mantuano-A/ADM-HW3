    Disclaimer: This is the 3rd instalment of the WIXOSS and would advise watching Selector Infected and Spread beforehand. Spoilers for prequels in this.<br />
<br />
For a quick summary, skip to bottom paragraph.<br />
<br />
The chains that bind us the most closely are the ones we have broken. <br />
<br />
The ‘lost storage’ part of the title is some great wordplay as it can be substituted for lost memories which is what defines this anime. The protagonist in question Homura Suzuko has returned to her hometown only to find out she must participate in a WIXOSS game that involves LRIGS. Morikawa Chinatsu, a childhood friend who has experienced hard times with her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236249">
        family’s financial position makes a declaration to Suzuko. Chinatsu without a moment’s hesitation firmly tells her to disappear as if she were unsightly. Chinatsu is adamant that she will regain happiness by severing all her ties with Suzuko, who is left stunned and speechless from their meeting.<br />
<br />
The WIXOSS game in this instalment has changed its rules, with the most noticeable one being that males are now participants this time round whereas in the prequels it was restricted to just females. The consequences for the game have changed dramatically, with winning and losing being dependant on the number of coins a LRIG user has. The LRIG user loses their personality and effectively dies when their coin’s total reaches to zero. The user’s LRIG takes possession of the former host’s body and continues life as planned. This is much like the LRIG switching bodies with their users once they became an eternal girl.<br />
<br />
Memories are the strongest themes associated with this version of WIXOSS. The notion that one would retain fond memories and try to block out unpleasant ones is the norm. The idea of altering undesirable memories is something that many would approve for due to its benefits involved. However, even when a LRIG user has obtained the 5 coins required to change a single memory, it never goes as planned as one has to reexperience that memory, which may prove to be repulsive for some as was the case for Mikage Hanna. Just like the other instalments it’s still a lose-lose situation with nothing but hardship and despair awaiting our participants.<br />
<br />
The bond that Suzuko and Chitose share goes back many years to the time they were still in elementary school. Personal circumstances dictated that they would not be reunited until sometime later but that didn’t stop Suzuko from keeping her in the back of her mind. The matching key-chain is a solid representation of their relationship, even though Chitose trampled on it declaring it was all over between them. Suzuko still was optimistic that their friendship could be restored and was genuinely concerned about her wellbeing.<br />
<br />
The girls have had their fair share of problems with Suzuko arguably having it the worst. The simple matter is she lost her mother during the separation stage and returned only because of her father’s work commitments. Meanwhile, Chitose’s family business went under with her family having to relocate most of the time due to the job insecurity involved. This doesn’t give the right for Chitose to act all obnoxious because of the fact she has suffered all this time. There was never a reason for Chitose to hate her knowing deep down she honestly liked her and saw her as the ideal friend.<br />
<br />
The antagonist this time is a man named Satomi who is known as the broker between the LRIG users. The shady man can set up matches for his clients who are desperate to earn some coins. The strange thing is that nobody suspected him of being a LRIG user this whole time. The fact is that LRIG users can identify each other within a certain radius but can’t detect him is baffling. I thought that all LRIG users had to carry their LRIG cards around but he never did which was surprising. It is known later that he challenges others to a battle when they are at a risk of being erased all together.<br />
<br />
To him, the act of ending one’s life is deemed to be irrelevant as he derives pleasure from the opposition’s anguish. The level of corruptness found in him was pitch black meaning he was a lost cause from the very beginning. The ability for him to nonchalantly carry out murders from a personality sense is made redundant when we find out it’s a former LRIG now in possession of the body. He wasn’t evil for the sake of being evil and I just found him to be a poorly written antagonist along with the plot conveniences.<br />
<br />
There is extra symbolism that needs mentioning. The LRIG template seen in the very beginning of the opening is an important discussion point. The white girl is the LRIG before users insert their personal memories into them. The template LRIG before then is a pure entity, meaning it has neither positive or negative memories. I would use the analogy of a new-born infant who enters the world as being sinless with nothing to be judged on. The LRIGs reflect the mental state of the user with Suzuko’s LRIG resembling Chinatsu and vice versa. The themes to be honest are a lot more engaging than the other aspects of the show such as the card battles which are secondary in nature.<br />
<br />
Now on to the technical aspects on the show, with the art style being quite different from its predecessor. The prequels had a design being dubbed dark moe which was true for those who sat through it. The art style is less moe than before but has much better character designs along with the fact you can’t have moe guys. There was a need to conform to a more traditional look even though the setting stayed relatively the same. The background art with some of it being CGI looks vastly improved in comparison to the prequels. The actual animation seems to have taken a decline in quality with it looking less fluid than before and more of an emphasis placed on still frames and such. There are also occasions of sloppily drawn characters which is just a minor gripe of mine.<br />
<br />
The sound by Maiko Iuchi (A Certain Magical Index, Heavy Object) was relatively tame compared to the other series she has produced music for. There was extensive electronic music used in this one which would be found mainly in the card battles. The tempo adjusts to the intensity of the scene which is determined by the situation involved. The voice actors did a decent job which was expected of them but Hashimoto Chinami who played Suzuko kind of irritated me with the prolonged “Chi-chan” cries making her sound like a child asking for forgiveness.<br />
<br />
TLDR: All in all, this was a relatively decent addition to the WIXOSS series but I find to be poorer in terms of script quality but in terms of thematic depth, it’s right up there with the characters holding it back. The production side to it felt adequate but feels like only the bare minimum being met in standards. The show is watchable but definitely has it faults here which is reflected in my score.<br />

    Perhaps the most disappointing entry in the Wixoss franchise.<br />
<br />
Lostorage incited WIXOSS biggest turn off is that the story and plot takes itself way too seriously, and is overly dramatic.  It’s so bad to the point where the show feels like a giant depressing mess. There aren&#039;t many enlightening moments featured within the story, which makes a majority of the show a chore to watch. In addition to this the dialogue and characters do not feel fleshed out enough. Characters that are featured feel so one dimensional.<br />
<br />
They have the childhood friends who have become disconnected.  There is the insane main antagonist who cannot be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236237">
        harmed until the end because of plot armor. Then lastly, we have the character, whom has morals, and a goal, yet falls flat during their big opportunity.  The biggest problem I had with them was that they lack any interesting qualities to their personalities.<br />
Of course the story goes back and tries to explain the past traumatic events to certain characters; which do in fact make the story and individual character a little more intriguing however, not to the point of complete satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Sometimes during the show I would think to myself, “Damn these guys need some Prozac.” However, I don’t even think that medication would help these crybabies and drama queens. The so called “drama” in the story is so cliché and repetitive that I found myself losing interest in the entire series.<br />
I would&#039;ve liked to see the show branch out more and at least try and get out of the constant drama.<br />
<br />
 I felt like the story needed that one fan service beach episode to enlighten the mood. This simply was not the case. One of the worst reoccurring themes in the story is the card battles. The overbearing drama coupled with the characters fear and lack of attitude that isn’t anger or depression took away the pleasure of watching the card game.<br />
<br />
This is how I interpreted the card battles,<br />
Suzuko: “wah wah, I can’t lose this battle; I only have one coin left, boo hoo.”<br />
Chinatsu:  (Unnecessary angry grunts and screaming) “I hate you; you need to disappear, derpa herp.”<br />
Kou: “Hee hee hee” (sucks crazy juice through a straw in the background) these dumb bitches are fighting for my amusement.”<br />
Hanna: ________ Attackuu, Coin betto, please recharge batteries... well she isn’t a robot but you get the picture.<br />
Rinse and repeat… <br />
<br />
Finally, during the girls&#039; overly dramatic climatic battle; I couldn’t feel bad nor make any connections to the characters because they&#039;ve been depressing and angry throughout the entire story. Flashbacks, intense moments of screaming &amp; crying... yeah, they&#039;ve been doing that through the span of the story. So why the hell would it make a difference now? Because it&#039;s the last episode? Of course.<br />
<br />
Overall the storytelling was terrible. It lacks refreshment and creativity. I felt like it focused too much on drama than the quality of anything else. I mean for Pete sake there was a damn suicide… lighten the story up just a little.<br />
<br />
Moving onto the art. The art and animation that Wixoss provides is pretty impressive, although I felt like there could&#039;ve been improvements to background settings, most specially details in objects. There could’ve been more of an effort made to make background details livelier. The special effects were good. <br />
<br />
They’re noticeable and stand out in battle, which makes the action look great! Character designs were not that impressive. I’m mostly criticizing the outfit designs for the Lrig’s for lack of creativity.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was pretty good. Maiko Iuchi &amp; Yasumasa Koyama did a great job with sound effects and creating music that fit the tone of many of the battles. The voice actors do a good job of making their characters sound like whiny annoying high school students,  and one crazy adult... well, sadistic man-child.<br />
<br />
Overall there are many changes I would’ve liked to have seen during the show. Number one would be more action without the dialogue. I felt like every time a character had an opportunity to speak they would just ruin the simplicity of a card game battle by making everything so serious. Lastly I would’ve loved to have seen at least one beach episode to enlighten the overall mood of the show. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, I was so unimpressed with this entry in the Wixoss franchise that I gave it a well-deserved final score of 4/10.<br />

    Lostorage Incited Wixoss isn&#039;t the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen but it certainly doesn&#039;t live up to its predecessors. <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10 <br />
The previous Wixoss shows were these high-stakes games where if you win you get a wish granted and if you lose it&#039;s reversed and your miserable. Despite the clunky explanations they gave it was still a clever and intimidating, the consequences mattered to the characters enough that the stakes were high. Lostorage changes it around so their memories are at stake, and while the downside is losing your memories and becoming an entirely different person, the upside is... the ability to change one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236321">
        your memories. <br />
How incredibly situational. In fact, if you want to change one of your memories you can just do that, that&#039;s how memory works. On top of that, the major conflict between the main characters feels incredibly forced. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound: 6 <br />
I am a whelp and don&#039;t generally notice the art and sound in anime. The environment the battles take place in is pretty cool but gets old quickly. Nothing else popped out at me.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3<br />
This is where Lostorage really falls flat. <br />
<br />
Homura Suzuko - Suzuko is the &quot;main character&quot; of Lostorage but she really doesn&#039;t feel like it. We don&#039;t really get into her headspace all that much past the first few episodes and because of how the show works by not really explaining the card game much, it&#039;s difficult to see her growth. If anything, it seems like rather than improving at the game like Ruko from Selector, she learned how to make up rules as she goes along. <br />
<br />
Hanna Mikage - Hanna is a weird mix of the cute small character due to her hands always being in her sleeves and the cold analytical character due to her personality. While Hanna as the best reason for wanting to win the game, regaining the memories of what happened to her late little brother, she also has the most obnoxious speech quirk of stating a word that summarizes her sentences before saying them. An example would be a sentence like &quot;Suspicion. What are you doing here?&quot; which would be ok for a minor character, but she ends up becoming a major character in the story and it is incredibly grating. <br />
<br />
Shohei Shirai - Is a nice guy. This is pretty much the extent to his personality, he&#039;s just really nice and wants to get some memories back about soccer or something. He refuses to fight battles early on even though the rules this time around impose a time limit that needs to be upheld by battles, so I don&#039;t know what he thought the outcome would be. His effect in the story is basically just to make one character question her actions but not actually do anything. <br />
<br />
Chinatsu Morikawa - She&#039;s the secondary main character, or arguably even the main character in this show, but I saved her til now because holy crap does this character suck. I hope it&#039;s not a spoiler since it happens pretty early on that she effectively becomes a villain for most of the show. The issue with this is that her reasons are absolutely absurd. She wants to forget her memories of her childhood with Suzuko in order to &quot;become stronger.&quot; It gets to the point where she has effectively killed people for this and she becomes completely irredeemable. I hate this character, she is an awful person for no reason. <br />
<br />
Kou Satomi - Here is the only good character. Satomi has a reasonably interesting backstory and is entertaining and expressive enough to be fun to watch. <br />
<br />
Unlike in Selector, the LRIGs are barely even characters. I guess it comes from them being a manifestation of their selectors&#039; memories rather than existing people with their own names and personalities, but there is no emotional connection there, no matter what the ending tries to dredge up. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
I kept trying to like this show. I thought at the beginning that the concept was interesting, but that was because I thought that the winner of the battles got to change their opponents&#039; memories, which could have led to an interesting plot whereby the characters don&#039;t know what&#039;s real or and maybe we would have gotten an unreliable narrator. Instead the premise just makes the battles feel like more of a chore than anything. I like how Satomi abused the system for his own amusement, and I suppose it makes sense for the time limit to be there in that case, but the incentive to winning is mostly just not having to play the game anymore, which makes the show just feel empty, like the characters aren&#039;t really working toward anything, they just want it to be over. <br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
Lostorage is not a very good show, which is disappointing because I thought Selector was great. It got to the point where the intricacies of the game really should have been explained better. The coin betting mechanic they introduce was cool and made every player seem unique, but without a knowledge of Wixoss as a game it doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense. The final episode is full of cop-outs too and while I do like the ending scene, a lot of the emotional moments feel profoundly undeserved.

    After what for most, was the peak of Wixoss, Selector spread, came Lostorage incited. Now in all honestly, I found my self feeling a slight disappointment that the original characters were no longer to be found in this new series. HOWEVER, this disappointment was soon to be turned to into an endless flow of love for the new characters and hype for what&#039;s to come. Especially for the next season, since it was hinted at times, that the original characters would be returning at some point. For example in the anime opening, a scene of Mizushima Kiyoi, also known as piruluk-tan, who was originally the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370237">
        LRIG (a person within a card, who a selector uses to battle another selector) of Akira (whom I like to call aki-lucky) was shown, in which she is human and her old LRIG form is flashed onto the screen momentarily. At this moment I was incapable of holding in my disbelief, and hope of a spectacular return of the original characters was reborn in me. As well as this, the now human Kiyoi becomes a crucial character later on, and especially in the next season, winning a spot as one of my favourite characters. Her nonchalant tone contrasting with her unyielding determination to end the chain of suffering after experiencing the pain of being a LRIG, established herself as an amazing character, who evolves even further in Lostorage Conflated. (fair amount of spoiler tbh but I don&#039;t think it affects enjoyment much)<br />
<br />
The MCs:<br />
But that&#039;s enough rambling when she isn&#039;t even one of the major main characters of this season. Now for Homura Suzuko, the main character of Lostorage incited. A girl much like Ruuko in terms of being warm and caring, however unlike her predecessor, she is bound by the childhood memories of her best friend Chinatsu Morikawa (aka Chi-chan, a very interesting character btw, I will get to her soon enough), who she has lost contact with. She starts off highly dependant on others, she spends each day replaying her memories of Chi and when she obtains the LRIG, Ril (whom she named based off a doll given to her by Chi-chan, Ril is another character I love) she is quick to turn to Ril for guidance and is soon unable to function properly without her. However, after the predictable yet impactful encounter with her best friend, Suzuko begins to change. Chinatsu, opposite to Suzu found her childhood memories painful, weighing her down and bringing unnecessary stress from trying to live up to Suzu&#039;s high expectations of her (I personally found it cool how Suzu&#039;s overeliant nature helped cause Chinatsu&#039;s change), along with other factors such as difficult living conditions, Chinatsu becomes twisted and seeks to use the wixoss battles to overwrite her childhood memories of Suzu and finally be free, no matter who she hurts along the way. Chinatsu is also a character I love dearly, she brought really dark or heart aching moments to the show, I found myself caring for and pitying Chi-chan despite her evil acts, which are generally rare coming from a show&#039;s main character. I wished for Suzu to be able to rescue her, Chi-chan was truly a tragic protagonist turned bad. To shorten what I could speak about forever, Suzu ultimately renews her passive nature and grows in confidence and strength alongside her trusted partner and friend, Ril, as she overcomes numerous wixoss battles in an attempt to bring Chi-chan back (who in her twisted state is being manipulated by a greater evil and the main villain Satomi Kou, more on him later), Suzuko&#039;s growth was one that really pleased me, bringing fresh air to the previous set of Wixoss characters and cleansing our pallet, so to speak, before the breathtaking finale season that is Lostorage Conflated.<br />
<br />
The battle system:<br />
With this new season came a new type of Wixoss battles. Instead of the previous reward and punishment of either being granted your wish or having the opposite of your wish occur, a selector (one who is part of the battles) is granted up to 5 coins representing their memories and a LRIG (the person within a card who a selector uses to battle another selector), who&#039;s personality and other aspects are formed based off of the selector&#039;s memories and experiences, for example Ril, knew all of Suzu&#039;s memories and acts in a stern yet caring way towards Suzu as a result (or at least that&#039;s what I believe). When battling a selector, winning means taking the opponents coin, which of course means the loser, has their coin taken along with the memories it represents. The stakes seem low compared to the previous seasons, right? That&#039;s what I thought too until I found that the loss of all a selector&#039;s coins mean they disappear from existence and their body is instead inhabited by the LRIG they once owned... I mean damn. Furthermore one of my favourite aspects of battling, coin betting was introduced, by offering to lose another of your coins if you lose the battle, a selector can use an ability specific to their LRIG, bringing a very fun aspect to selector battles raising the stakes of battles even more, I was very hyped when coins were bet, to the say the least. Oh yeah I completely forgot the reward hehe... Winning 5 coins means you get to change a memory in any way... Great reward to risk ratio am I right... WELL TOUGH Wixoss has never been about things being fair and balanced, the cruelty of selector battles is emphasised by this reward in my opinion. I&#039;d imagine, merely being able to survive these battles if I were in a selectors position would be a tremendous relief. Once again the old way of battles has evolved after Ruuko (the previous protagonist) fought Mayu and supposedly destroyed the wixoss battles, only for the battles to be reborn as an even more convoluted way of torturing humanity. The idea of the build up of humanity&#039;s negative emotions resulting in the wixoss battles was an idea which impressed and intrigued me deeply. To me it made great sense, where would the strong feelings of stress, sorrow, anger and hate, go in the world? Would they just simply disappear with time? No, it makes much more sense to me that these strong emotions result in something befitting of the pain everyone had suffered because of them. What else than the birth of the new selector battles which force innocent people into a cruel battle for their precious memories, birthing more pain and suffering and continuing what Kiyoi calls &#039;the endless cycle of darkness&#039;. Once again I&#039;ll stop myself from rambling further on about this.(i forgot to mention that coins disappear over time if no battles occur, so avoiding battles is not an option for the selectors)<br />
<br />
Satomi Kou, villain:<br />
Satomi kou is a man, who was previously a LRIG and is now inhabiting the body of his previous owner, who I assume lost all their coins. He is known to selectors as the bookmaker, since he runs a service where he sets up battles between selectors who have signed a contract with him so as to ensure they have selectors to battle before their coins disappear on their own. However, the battles they get set up with are compulsory, even if they did not want to battle for whatever reason. Kou finds the torment and pain selectors experience stimulating. He prides himself in setting up selector battles to produce the maximum amount of despair. It is his revenge against the selectors who heartlessly used their LRIGS like tools, as well as his twisted method of fulfilling himself. He recruits Chinatsu as a subordinate to carry out this despair, I found it heartbreaking watching Kou&#039;s venomous nature seep into Chi-chan, as she recruits innocent selectors into the bookmaker&#039;s trap. On a final note I really enjoyed observing Kou&#039;s sadistic nature as he guides selectors to their dooms (the faces he makes are especially breathtaking in my opinion lol)<br />
<br />
I decided to review Lostorage incited, specifically because it is the least liked of Wixoss&#039; seasons, I wanted to project how amazing I found the characters (many of which I haven&#039;t mentioned), and how well this season performs in both following Selector spread, which could have been a finale in itself, as well as setting up perfectly for the true finale, Lostorage conflated, which was able to win me over and choose the Wixoss series as my favourite anime despite it&#039;s obscurity and unpopularity.<br />
I wish more people would share the same love for Wixoss as I do (If you wanna help you could... i dunno maybe rate every Wixoss season a 10 or another high score (;  or don&#039;t, just a thought... please do it!)<br />
<br />
Extra Notes:<br />
I found it so satisfying whenever Ril and Suzu bet a coin and went &quot;coin bet! HONEST!&quot;<br />
The contorted evil faces the characters made at times were amazing, Kou and Chi-chan making them were to be expected since they were more on the evil side, but then Ril makes one too, ahh it got me good.<br />
When the selector who lost his sister (his name eludes me, guess I should rewatch Wixoss) was fighting Kou and fell into a blind rage and then disappeared whilst crying , it was a very heart touching moment for me, a character who isn&#039;t too relevant being able to make me tear up is a rare thing indeed, well done wixoss, well done indeed.<br />
The disappearance of the boy who liked chinatsu was a tragic one too, sighh<br />
The WIXOSS OPENINGS ARE ALL FIRE, opening 1, killy killy joker is my favourite, opening 4 unlock is a close second, and 3rd is opening 2 girls rondo worlds end, funnily the lostorage incited op is the lowest of the 4 openings but it&#039;s still an opening very dear to me, I cant help but headbop to the wixoss openings.<br />
oh yeah when chinatsu tells suzu not to give up, &quot;Suzu Gamba *smiles*&quot; warms my heart every time i think about it, I use it as a charm when the going gets tough, always works lol.<br />
The character Hanna is also an amazing one but I don&#039;t wanna speak forever so i&#039;ll stop.<br />
Man I love talkin about wixoss.

    Ok, after selector spread WIXOSS, we&#039;re now introduced to a sequel.....if we can call it that , which is Lostorage Incited WIXOSS. Both sequel have the same genre that ranges from School, Psychological, Shoujo and drama, but, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS has a yuri element in it cu&#039;z it involves the relationship of two former childhood friends namely Suzuko Homura and Chinatsu Morikawa. Also, though both may be the same in one way they&#039;re still different in another way, in which it wouldn&#039;t be fair to say that one is the continuation of the other. Let&#039;s not forget that selector spread WIXOSS has a clean ending

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236401">
        and it wasn&#039;t much of a disappointment, while Lostorage Incited WIXOSS has somewhat a lot of loose ends, soooooo, <br />
<br />
Storywise, I&#039;ve rated it as a Mediocre 5, since it still has the same plot with some slight differences, when it comes to how both main characters got their start from being drafted in the WIXOSS game, and both have the same situation as to what them selector have to do, the only differences was that in the 1st WIXOSS the loser only gets to have her wish cursed and it was also not good for the winner since she get&#039;s taken over by the LIRG, while the 2nd WIXOSS the selector looses his or her memories and get&#039;s taken over by a LIRG, but nothing was known if the loosing selector becomes a LIRG, since at the end of this anime we the audience haven&#039;t seen any LIRG who is a guy and in fact I don&#039;t think that the antagonist itself is a guy at all, he is more like a female LIRG in a guy&#039;s body.<br />
<br />
Art, just like any anime with a school genre, I&#039;ve rated it as a mediocre 5, since we still see them characters in their  quintessential eye candy school uniform, and the LIRG&#039;s themselves, when it come to their attire were not that different from the LIRG&#039;s of the 1st WIXOSS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound, frankly, I have no comment as to which seiyuu voiced who, the rating &quot;good 7&quot; is for the opening theme.<br />
<br />
Characters, remember the loose ends I&#039;ve mentioned? Well, the characters themselves were the loose ends, namely:<br />
<br />
Suzuko Homura- ok, so she came back to Ikebukuro from Hokkaido due to family issues, what were her family issues we don&#039;t know that her loose end, also, her character suggests that she may be lesbian and wants to continue her relationship with Chi chan, but got sided when Chichan seemly tries to distance herself from her, don&#039;t get me wrong, but I like her her character is good but not very good.<br />
<br />
Chinatsu Morikawa- Suzu&#039;s childhood friend and pretty much a lesbian, her loose end is for us not know what were the memories she want&#039;s to forget, and foe her to forget Suzu was just too shallow for her to risk getting her ass in the hole of being a selector, though she got her wish, since Mel now has her body, her ending arc was the bitter part for me.<br />
<br />
 Kou Satomi the bookkeeper, I&#039;d say that anime writer Michihiro Tsuchiya, did a good job of adding him as the main antagonist, his loose end was the details as how he came to be which is pretty unclear, and is he a LIRG in a man&#039;s body or is he a LIRG who came in to the real world  and became a man by choice? Either, it wasn&#039;t konw if we will be able to see him again in another WIXOSS sequel.<br />
<br />
Hanna Mikage- I can&#039;t understand as to why she has to be one of them selectors just to find out as to what has happen to her bother, when she can simply ask her mom or her oneechan.<br />
<br />
Shohei Shirai- I kind like that he traide in vain to save Chichan, too bad that he could have broken the Suzu X Chi yuri relationship.<br />
<br />
LIRG&#039;s , I have nothing much to say since their personalities  were merely the same as the 1st WIXOSS except in a different attire and capability.<br />
<br />
So with all that&#039;s been said , I give the characters a good 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, it was good enough for me to keep following up this anime, but I just can&#039;t forgive that yuri element that this anime has, sure it maybe touching and nice, but it feels like that the ending was rushed and we&#039;re left as to why Chi chan want&#039;s to get rid of her memories, also what&#039;s up with the college of her choice that she has to throw a fit towards her folks? all we know was that she is now Mel. So, it was a good enough 7 , for this part.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime has presented us with a bitter sweet ending, sweet cu&#039;z Suzu is still Suzu and is no longer a selector, same cannot be said for Chi chan, also this sequel hasn&#039;t given us a clean ending, so overall this is a fair 6, so, another sequel? Maybe. Honest.<br />
<br />
   GROW!!!!!! <br />

    I was not particularly impressed by the first two seasons of this show, which were named similarly inexplicably, but I did think they were at least passably entertaining. They seemed melodramatic and heavy handed, and somehow at the same time the story felt like the stakes were very low. All in all, it felt like a pretty cool idea hampered by some pretty blah execution. When I saw that there was a new season (series?) coming out, and that the name was somehow even crazier, I was like &quot;oh this is going to be awful and I can&#039;t wait to watch it!&quot;<br />
I started this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237453">
        expecting to laugh at watching it fall painfully down the stairs, but I will be damned if I am not actually really enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Story: Anime had a baby with one of the darker Blocks of Magic the Gathering. Young people, originally just girls but now in the 3rd season suddenly boys too, have to play MTG in the Twilight Zone, but if they lose too many times shit goes downhill. It&#039;s more or less an attempt to make a serious anime out of the genre that contains shows like Yugioh, Beyblade, and Cardfight Vanguard. The first season felt like an amateurish attempt at that; this one feels like the concept has been refined into something much more ominous and engaging. There appear to be approximately 0 rules to the card game as well, but in a way that feels much quicker and not so bogged down in the mechanics as compared to Yugioh. Watching people play a children&#039;s trading card game gets boring fast. This is more like watching people slowly fall apart emotionally while playing a children&#039;s trading card game, which at least allows for some stakes and character development.<br />
<br />
Art: It all looks pretty good. Only pretty good though. The human characters are kind of bland and monochromatic, although in all honesty it kind of adds to the already noticeably bleak and melancholy atmosphere. The characters who are actually children&#039;s trading cards look significantly cooler, and the aesthetic of the card fights is both unique and attractive.<br />
<br />
Sound: Atmospheric and perfectly appropriate, although not particularly memorable. The opening song is also pretty bad (skip-worthy).<br />
<br />
Characters: In the first two seasons I though that they were silly; in this season I think they are actually mostly pretty good. There are still some characters who feel very artificial, and unfortunately the main character, Suzu, is among them. Some of the other main and supporting characters, particularly grumpy AF Chinatsu and certified weirdo Hanna, are fun and interesting, and seem to have believable motivations and real human reactions to difficult situations. Watching them struggle is both gripping and sympathetic.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Way more than I expected. If this had been lame, I was perfectly prepared to drop it after a couple episodes and never think of the series again. Instead I ended up writing an overly elaborate review for it and would recommend it to anyone who likes broody psychological stories and also wouldn&#039;t be bored to death by the idea of watching some kids play Magic.

    A game that can end up granting your most desirable wish or leave you with only the feeling of despair, welcome to WIXOSS.<br />
This being the first season I watch from the WIXOSS saga I must say I&#039;m not disappointed, most of the users that have been keeping up with the saga will probably disagree with me as they have already seen the previous ones. It wasn&#039;t particularly the anime that I&#039;ve enjoyed the most but it somehow managed to get entertaining and being an overall passable anime. <br />
<br />
The main story about this friendship getting torn apart got completely dramatized in my opinion, generating such conflict

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374016">
        over a misunderstood perception of friendship I&#039;d say was unnecessary. But in the end, the dependence they both have for each other ends up being something good. They both end up being someone they look up to. It really ends up showing some values to put it in a way. The side stories were not that bad either and it got interesting seeing the character development shown in this anime. Although this didn&#039;t quite incite me to continue with the rest of the seasons, I&#039;d overall rate it a 7.<br />

    Well looks like WIXOSS is plaguing new characters with new rules but the same old bleak outcomes.<br />
<br />
Lostorage Incited WIXOSS is by all means the same game and a somewhat continuation from the original Selector WIXOSS series what with it&#039;s several hints towards the fact. Lostorage Incited WIXOSS however does have differing themes towards it&#039;s original series what with it&#039;s new cast and main characters of Suzuko Homura voiced by Chinami Hashimoto and Chinatsu Morikawa voiced by Yuka Iguchi.<br />
<br />
Lostorage Incited WIXOSS&#039; characters are probably one of the better strengths due to it&#039;s development of it&#039;s core players, especially concerning Suzuko, Chinatsu and Hanna Mikage voiced by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236324">
        Yuriko Kubo a genius at WIXOSS and a writer for a WIXOSS magazine. LA says this as Suzuko and Chinatsu brings in a theme of duality, one going through the WIXOSS game unscathed and peacefully, the other dragging other people to the twisted game and not caring what happens in order to win. Suzuko is by all means one of those protagonist who is unsure of herself due to her recently transferring schools, but at the same time trying to find her old best friend, Chinatsu. Chinatsu on the other hand experiencing many hardships and using WIXOSS to erase any of Suzuko&#039;s memories she had as a motivation. Suzuko and Chinatsu does bring in yuri undertones though not at first. Really Suzuko&#039;s and Chinatsu&#039;s development through WIXOSS are interesting contrasts to one another. LA will bring up the fact that sure Chinatsu goes down the &quot;evil just because&quot; and doesn&#039;t realize she&#039;s being played by the puppetmaster to the new WIXOSS game Kou Satomi voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura, but if going by the duality theme, she made a good anti-villain, although her decent into darkness is somewhat forcifully played at first to make her play her part AND her ignorance and motivations didn&#039;t really add up to show her true motivations. The other players of the WIXOSS game do have their motivations to win (the win function is different from the original series now, instead of having any wish you want, it&#039;s now about memory, but yes, the lose function is the SAME from the original) and given some character development to the characters and really it&#039;s not like the characters &quot;dies&quot;, it&#039;s more like their &quot;personalities&quot; change to the point they might as well be new characters. Besides Kou Satomi having an impact towards the plot, Shouhei Shirai voiced by Shinsuke Sugawara, a friend of Chinatsu and Hanna Mikage get a more centralized focus in terms of character development, Hanna if anything is finding something about her own memory that she has forgotten and will win just to find out, she also essentially becomes Suzuko&#039;s mentor later on, on the other perspective, Shouhei DOESN&#039;T want to fight any battles and just try to live out the game by the newly added &quot;90 day time limit&quot; to the other new &quot;coin function&quot;. Kou Satomi however is a different breed of character altogether, being a mysterious benefactor and bad influence towards Chinatsu and just Satomi in general being a puppetmaster to Lostorage Incited WIXOSS makes him both an interesting character and obviously suspicious character. Hanna Mikage however is probably one of the better developed characters, with her motivations, impact towards Suzuko along with her having a resolved plotline of her own and to make it better, her personality making her LA&#039;s favourite character in Lostorage Incited WIXOSS.<br />
<br />
Some flaws however...Lostorage Incited WIXOSS once again like it&#039;s predecessor doesn&#039;t really want to focus on the game it in real life is an actual card game trying to advertise to us and instead making a game where you&#039;ll lose everything just by playing and losing isn&#039;t good advertising material, Lostorage Incited also gets to some moments in the games they play where it felt like they did some illegal moves which compounded by the fact of the &quot;Coin Bets&quot; makes the rules even more confusing and sorta asspulling at times, the biggest offender going to Suzuko because she&#039;s the main protagonist and whatnot and we &quot;gotta keep the main protagonist alive&quot; and everything. But for the most part that is a more &quot;sins of the father&quot; flaw towards Lostorage Incited. The next problem is that once characters lose everything, again they don&#039;t necessary die in Lostorage, but once they do lose they become a pawn to Satomi and essentially lose focus towards them and sure the anime is more focused on Suzuko and Chinatsu dilemma, but nonetheless it then brings up the predictability to the results of some of the games at that. LA will bring up one more flaw but that a bit later...<br />
<br />
There are callbacks to the original series, mainly from the ruined WIXOSS stage shown as background throughout the anime thus saying it&#039;s a conituation from the original series, the other more obvious one being Piruluk voiced by Saori Oonishi from the original series returning, LA isn&#039;t saying that because it has callbacks it&#039;s bad, but it does makes Lostorage Incited WIXOSS a bit more interesting, LA main concern about this mainly coming from Satomi and where most of LA&#039;s speculation compounded by the callbacks came from.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation once again done by JC Staff, the animation has the same aesthetics to the original series overall and really the detailed backgrounding to the distinct character designs makes the characters easy to notice and easy enough to see that the character designs are pretty well done. The backgrounding especially in the new WIXOSS battlefield has quite the contrast to to the real world, what with it being ruined and rusty looking to contrast to the more colorful &quot;table cubes&quot; that the players fight on. Not much else to say but ok animation overall.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, LA does have to commend Yuriko Kubo in voicing Hanna and Chinami Hashimoto did decently as the main protagonist, but LA does have to tip LA&#039;s hat to Yuka Iguchi in voicing Chinatsu, fine call her hamming up her vocals and being &quot;edgy and dark&quot; but that&#039;s just what LA kinda liked about Chinatsu as she drove deeper to the dark side and Yuka Iguchi&#039;s vocals were more or less perfect for this role, range is more or less why LA picked Yuka Iguchi as LA&#039;s favourite voice actor, Yuriko Kubo gets second place. However as much as Yuka Iguchi gets broad range, it&#039;s Yuuichi Nakamura that goes full out crazy with his vocals ESPECIALLY during the final episode if anything showing Satomi&#039;s hamminess up to MAX levels far out beatng Yuka Iguchi&#039;s &quot;edgy vocals&quot;, it kind made sense since he&#039;s the major antagonist of this series, but still LA kinda liked found that it was making him the cheesy over the top villain by the end of it to the point LA can easily say that Yuka Iguchi&#039;s edgy vocals is on point compared to Yuuichi&#039;s haminess. <br />
<br />
The ending gave us a sorta satisfying yet depressing ending. Let&#039;s start with bringing back to Yuuichi&#039;s Satomi role into this is where Yuuichi both shined and detrimented Satomi by the end. Firstly, the final battle had it&#039;s flaws with the &quot;illegal moves?&quot; along with Satomi getting thrown into the mix as to LA&#039;s speculation lead LA...NOWHERE as he never tells us WHO he is at all, so LA&#039;s speculation and investment to this character went nowhere. Secondly, THE FINALE was where Satomi goes full out crazy with Yuuichi&#039;s hammy villainy vocals just makes the entire atmosphere comical than threatening if anything which brings up Satomi&#039;s detriments as a character, how he shined was that Yuuichi Nakamura was giving his all to this character but that&#039;s all LA is giving him. Where the satisfying yet depressing ending comes from is the aftermath with Suzuko and Chinatsu by the end of it which &quot;resolves&quot; things with these two characters and really reigns in LA&#039;s duality theme with these two characters and vaguely gives epilogues to the rest of the cast. The only plotline they left loose is with Satomi. Nonetheless, a satisfying yet depressing ending which is a plus for LA.<br />
<br />
Lostorage Incited WIXOSS may have the &quot;sins of the father&quot; flaws it had from it&#039;s original series, but Lostorage Incited WIXOSS still feels like it&#039;s own, what with it&#039;s new rules and new characters and if there was anything LA would commend Lostorage Incited for in which the original series didn&#039;t would be it&#039;s more focused characters and to be honest, it&#039;s more darker and depressing nature of the WIXOSS game it impacts on it&#039;s characters it takes itself in which the original really never went to. It&#039;s hard to compare Lostorage to it&#039;s Selector counterpart as they both have their flaws and their strengths, but if there was anything to go by for Lostorage Incited WIXOSS that made LA still carry on watching was it&#039;s greater detailed character development, the GREAT vocal talent and the massive amount of speculation that fueled LA to see what will happen next.

    This anime is an example of awful execution. <br />
The writer seems to have no idea how to put together what they wanted to create.<br />
A lot of the dialogue is extremely awkward and most of the characters are very annoying and/or socially crippled.<br />
It&#039;s full of clichés and borrowed elements which are amateurishly stitched together.  <br />
<br />
It has some good ideas, most of which are very unoriginal, but with the right execution could form a wonderful story. <br />
Shame the execution is so horrible. <br />
<br />
The set-ups into various plot points, which are suppose to be meaningful, are so poor that one&#039;s enjoyment suffers greatly.<br />
A lot of people brainlessly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236699">
        just watch and go along with what&#039;s happening without thinking about it, so the awful storytelling and design won&#039;t bother them that much. <br />
<br />
Do I regret watching it? Not at all. <br />
Honestly, the anime was kind of interesting to watch, even if I had to spam my friend multiple times about how awful the anime is. <br />
One can learn a lot from this anime. How to not tell a story, for example. And how to not develop characters.

    this is most disappointing entry in the Wixoss franchise. for your information I have Watched  Selector Infected and Selector Spread Wixoss.the first episode of selector infected wixoss is much more better for the first impression than lostorage series,if you rewatch selector infected wixoss, and you can feel the thriller. and the script for this series is very boring,  It was dramatic but the story itself fell short, not like the previous two wixoss series when the best screen writter mari okada as Series Composition on two previous wixoss series, and not the same director.<br />
<br />
for the artwork, studio pablo  did not handle the

    I really enjoyed Selector Infected and Selector Spread Wixoss, while neither were perfect I loved watching them. When I heard of another season of the anime, I was ecstatic. However Lostorage Incited Wixoss was not a patch on the previous two seasons.<br />
<br />
Story (5/10):<br />
The story itself fell short for me. It was all too dramatic, it didn&#039;t make any sense or make for an enjoyable viewing. The characters emotions seemed like they were exaggerated to make a plot. In terms of the games, the way they changed it with the game revolving around a selector&#039;s memories seemed good at the beginning but as the season went

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238267">
        on there wasn&#039;t the same feeling about the games. There wasn&#039;t the same worry, it didn&#039;t seem as big of a deal if you lost or won like it did with Selector Infected/Spread. While some parts of the plot were fun to watch, overall it just seemed messy and like the writers didn&#039;t know where they were going with it.<br />
<br />
Art (6/10):<br />
Not much to say about the art, it was okay nothing appalling in my opinion. But then again nothing memorable either.<br />
<br />
Sound (5/10):<br />
The music was really disappointing. The title sequence was forgettable and not even worth watching. I loved the title sequence&#039;s for the past two seasons, with Kanon Wakeshima singing both. They were both great, and it was so disappointing that with Lostorage the music is just so forgettable and not even worth listening to.<br />
<br />
Character (5/10): <br />
The two main characters, Suzuko and Chinatsu, were pretty bland. Their friendship was interesting, and I thought Chinatsu&#039;s story was interesting in regards with her family life and how she struggles to be the best at everything. Suzuko was sweet but there was no real background and I just didn&#039;t really seem to care. I was happy to see a range of selectors in the sequence, thinking that the season may not just focus on two people but a range. It didn&#039;t. Other charcter&#039;s like Rio or Shohei were only touched on and kinda faded into the background. Even the LRIG&#039;s seemed more boring this time, there was no real personality to any of them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6/10): <br />
As much as there was to pick at and complain about, I still enjoyed it. The basic premise was the same from the previous seasons and that&#039;s what I loved. It still had me on the edge of my seat at some battles and there were many great moments within the show.<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10):<br />
I would suggest you watch Selector Infected/Spread, not only to give you a little background on the universe but also as in my opinion they are much better than Lostorage. I am a little dissapointed with this in comparison to previous seasons but I still enjoyed it, and I hope they&#039;ll improve it with the next season.

    SPOILER ALERT!!!<br />
<br />
A mediocre story with a decent concept. While it doesn&#039;t live up to its predecessors, it certainly gave the dark fantasy vibes that define wixoss itself. The main problem is the characters that literally made no sense in their actions whatsoever. There is very little growth on Suzuko, the so-called main protagonist that literally spent half the series being a wishy-washy MC that literally couldn&#039;t stand up for herself and hold a grip on her life. The second main character, Chinatsu (arguably felt more important than the actual MC), was the bitchy type character that wanted to cut her ties with the MC for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389637">
        some stupid reason (honestly her change in attitude felt so forced) and magically turned good at the end because you know, its the final episode and the genius writer just wanted to sort of resolved the problem with no solution whatsoever. The art has certainly improved and the music were okay.

    Yet one more addition to the WIXOSS series.  <br />
<br />
Something I could have never imagined happened, the story got even worse. In the first seasons we had the girls battling between them to gain what they wish for the most but this time around they play with their memories at stake. This is cool and all that but they don&#039;t win anything and put themselves in danger. So, the story starts with our main characters returning to her hometown, and oh boy, some changes have been made to WIXOSS, a good but late change was that guys can be selectors but other than that it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409131">
        was a downgrade, 6/10  <br />
<br />
The art is a lot better but the release date was later too. 7/10  The opening is a 7.5 and the ending a 7, nothing too special, 7/10  <br />
<br />
The characters are a bit more interesting than the first seasons but well, it has been 36 episodes you know. Pretty inexcusable that they are not that interesting after so much time. 6/10  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment is around 5, it just got worse and this series has grown into trash, it could have ended in season 2 really well but nah they kept farming it.  Overall, lostorage is simply a downgrade and unnecessary continuation that had no reason to exist and it only made the pretty mediocre series even worse. 6/10
