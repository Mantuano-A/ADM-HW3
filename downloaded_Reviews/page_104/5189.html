    This anime is a sole reminder to not take harem seriously.<br />
<br />
When I first saw GF GF reception, and how everyone thought it was cringe or some bs takes up space for no reason, I instantly knew that this was something for me to watch. For some reason, anything with an illogical nature or dumb premise (or just a low mean score) seems to be frowned upon just because it is dumb and cringe and bluepilled. But some anime are dumb on purpose, so I don&#039;t understand why stupid anime are taken so seriously, because that isn&#039;t the way they are meant to be judged upon,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409571">
        GF GF is a good example of this.<br />
<br />
This anime is ridiculous, follows wacky and over-the-top character behaviour with some chemistry going up and down like some kind of deranged trigonometric polynomial function, the story just does whatever the hell it wants, and I really have a feeling it will get even more ridiculous down the line. But it is all this nonsense that makes GF GF so fun to watch. Alongside the production behind this, which seems to have a higher budget and better seiyuus than any harem I can remember. Well, maybe not as good looking as Oresuki was tho. GF GF is genuinely something I look forward to, all in all, it&#039;s alright to like stupid stuff.<br />
<br />
In any case, this anime is something you want to watch in this dry season, the same season with some Otome bs I dropped 65 years ago, some fanfic spin-off of ReLife and Sakurasou, and WEP 2.0. I have said what I have needed to say. Hopefully, this preview has convinced you to watch GF GF not as something along the lines of &lt;name of very deep anime is very deep&gt; but as something to sit down and have a laugh at.<br />
<br />
10/10 because I laughed. A lot.<br />
<br />
No. This is not a satire.<br />
No. I am not trolling.<br />
No. I am not joking.

    A man and four women become entangled in a web of jealousy, shame, and cuckoldry…<br />
<br />
Once in a while, controversial anime like Kanojo mo Kanojo come along and strike a nerve with the audience. These anime can become successes and get praised by fans. Or they can become punching bags—a joke to the whole community. It would be easy to write off KanoKano as cringe, degenerate, and trash, as so many already have, but don’t be so hasty.<br />
<br />
Accusing Girlfriend, Girlfriend of being cringe is like saying Gintama isn’t historically accurate. You haven’t figured out something that isn’t obvious. Of course, it is cringy, degenerate, and trashy—harem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416986">
        anime usually are. Most of them are testosterone-induced fantasies written by men. But they cover this fact with melodrama and superficial depth. KanoKano does not pretend—it digs deep into the recesses of your desires and pulls primal emotions kicking and screaming to the surface of your subconscious. It is like witnessing a violent car crash. You can’t help but gawk at it with morbid curiosity. Though it panders to harem fans with excessive fanservice, it works to bait unsuspecting viewers. To call KanoKano a “deconstruction” would be cliche. More accurately, it is a perversion of the harem genre that will appeal to those willing to read between the lines.<br />
<br />
Girlfriend, Girlfriend fully commits to being idiotic and humiliating to watch. It leans into the cringe, and that’s why it works. It’s easy to write it off as another crappy harem anime. The characters are archetypal, seemingly generic, and they make illogical decisions that conflict with their interests. Naoya wants to protect his girlfriend and give her unconditional love, yet he refuses to reject another girl and becomes a ‘two-timer’. Saki wants Naoya to herself and fears he might cheat on her, yet she allows him to date another girl as soon as he begs. Nagisa wants to advance her relationship with Naoya, but she insists on giving Saki a head start. This circle of painfully obvious miscommunication fuels both the plot and our frustrations with the characters. <br />
<br />
While I could pick apart the anime’s many flaws, like cinema sins, then pat myself on the back for being so above the latest trashy harem, that’d be doing it a disservice. I’m guilty of judging this anime before watching it—I called it garbage based on the trailer. Before avoiding it, you should take a look at every other harem anime and male-power-fantasy then ask yourself, isn&#039;t this the same tripe you’re used to, except amplified? I’m asking you to peek under the hood of this dumpster fire with me. There’s a method to the madness.<br />
<br />
One bold harem author asks, what would happen if everyone wins? Saki’s plight is all due to his intervention. She is the heroine in a seemingly average romantic comedy. All of a sudden, her ideal boyfriend proposes an idea—what if they date another girl? Though she detests the idea of competing for her boyfriend, she is fascinated. Saki expresses attraction for Nagisa in a way that insinuates she is bisexual. Doubtlessly, this explains why she finds an odd excitement in watching Naoya and Nagisa be romantic. These netorare moments are more self-aware than the banal cuckoldry in Domestic Girlfriend. Either girl has an objective; to seduce Naoya, but their fatal flaws prevent them from achieving their goals. Saki’s envy for Nagisa’s curvy body, bodacious breasts, and attentiveness stifles her self-confidence. She feels an innate sense that Naoya is rightfully hers. After all, Nagisa is a plus one who they may eject at any moment. Nagisa understands why Saki is defensive of Naoya. That’s why she supports her. Like a sister-wife! Saki finds herself in these precarious situations because of her naivety. She could easily dump both of them and date a woman instead. In her daily life, she presents as a confident, upstanding student. Behind closed doors, where she lives with boyfriend and girlfriend, her id manifests itself. Watching her personality unravel as the straight man to Naoya’s dense behavior never got tiring. Every joke increases in severity. All manner of sexual desire and insecurities crawl to the surface—creating some truly cringe-worthy moments. I loved every second of it. <br />
<br />
Nagisa is perhaps the most disturbing of the five characters. She has no backstory, no family, no friends, no aspirations aside from her boyfriend, and very little character depth. She is horny all the time, unconditionally in love with Naoya, masochistic and satisfied with being his side hoe. Her only ‘development (if you can call it that) involves coming to terms with her stupidity and reliance on Naoya for a purpose. If you imagine a cardboard cutout of the idealized anime waifu, you would see her face. She unconditionally loves you. She is willing to go along with anything you say. All harem anime present this fantasy—she is the final form. The author neither glorifies nor condemns it. He simply presents her unabashedly. <br />
<br />
Naoya, however, is attracted to these... qualities. <br />
<br />
Naoya grapples with being a societal pariah and maintaining his polyamorous relationship. His character arc isn’t about growing to love his girlfriends more because he already loves Saki and Nagisa unconditionally by the time they become a thruple. His growth is about overcoming shame. This shame is an intentional jab at fans of the harem genre—the humiliation of how society views his love of multiple people as deplorable behavior. People judge him with words like “Cheater” and “Two-timer”. We love the fantasy of having numerous people fall in love with us because it’s satisfying. In reality, it could never happen. You would be ripped apart by society if your fantasies were actualized. Naoya goes to incredible lengths to protect the secrecy of his scandalous relationship; he nearly pays a million yen to keep the truth hidden. At school, he and Saki pretend to be in a monogamous relationship while poor Nagisa sits alone. She sacrifices having a normal love life to be with Naoya: she avoids the shame potentially brought upon her partners if the truth came out through being stealthy. One of the primary sources of shame is Milika.<br />
<br />
Oh, how I loathed Milikia from the beginning. Although she shames Naoya for two-timing, everyone can tell she envies his girlfriends. She forces herself into the middle of Naoya, Saki, and Nagisa’s complex thruple. Even though they plead with her to just leave them alone, she refuses. It gets to the point where she literally camps outside of their home, waiting for Naoya to fall in love with her. No one in their right mind would think this is an ordinary way to win someone’s affection, but Milika is certainly not in her right mind. She is a fantasy version of a harem heroine cranked up to insanity. Her love for Naoya is obsessive to the point she stalks him. The truth is, this is the kind of girl who exists in harem anime. She inexplicably falls madly in love with a generic male protagonist; to any average person, this seems insane. In reality, the fantasy waifu who will chase after your heart could never exist healthily. The most comparable character I can think of is Yuno Gasai from Future Diary.<br />
<br />
Milika is a textbook narcissist.  Her attempts to make Naoya fall for her are humiliating to observe. She’s so tragically unaware that not everyone is in love with her. She has a youtube channel entirely based around showing off her busty cleavage for her audience. And when asked what her favorite thing is, she says: “Myself!” Her vanity is one-dimensional, undeniably sexist, and hammered into the audience. The author intended for her to be cringeworthy. For me, it was a hilarious sight to behold.<br />
<br />
Last but not least is Shino, Saki’s best friend and the audience’s avatar. For the first ten episodes, she is a background character who is fooled by the thruple’s monogamous charade. She becomes curious about Saki’s taboo love life, hiding her true intentions with the thin veil of ‘concern for her friend’. Truthfully, she is just like us, a passive observer who peers at the car crash from the rearview mirror. Instead of driving away, she becomes swept into the tornado of lies and humiliation. Shino’s concern for Saki quickly becomes an obsession; she wants to know if the scandalous rumor is true: Is her friend truly perverse? Or has she been manipulated by her depraved boyfriend? Her concern quickly turns to obsession, even stalking. Watching her struggle to understand Naoya, Saki, and Nagisa’s love triangle is exciting because I see my old self in her: Bewildered but morbidly curious enough to prod further. <br />
<br />
I will admit, this anime kind of looks terrible. The best storyboards are ripped straight from the manga: such as the creatively framed cuckolding shots and innumerable over-the-top reaction faces. It’s a shame this subversive masterpiece got treated like dime-a-dozen harem trash. Girlfriend, Girlfriend is a genuinely ridiculous anime. But to me, it is fascinating as well. It appeals to the cynic within me. Though it does not have a deep story, it never failed to engage me. I was always able to laugh with it or at it. Still, it accomplishes something so subversive that it makes me wonder if the writers, artists, and actors were all in on the joke.

    GF GF is such a highly overrated show, but in its entirety, it is just lukewarm at best. <br />
<br />
At first, I thought I had found a hidden gem, but it turned out to be a whole whirlpool of mud that was trying to disguise itself as one. As a generic series that always falls short of its originality, GF GF is just a series that is trying to appear original by accepting the concept of having more than one partner at a time. But it never succeeded with its bizarre roller-coaster of chaos that simply ensued from the questionable thinking of one boy, who decided to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417054">
        go through with it without any plausible reason at all. Just maybe, it was there for the comedic plot of the series, but it is not even moderately funny. To be fair, I&#039;d try not to take it seriously, but my man, it&#039;s just twice as bad. To be honest, he reminds me of Makoto 2.0, a person who wants to justify cheating by forcing it on all of his partners. I would have agreed with him if it hadn&#039;t turned into such a trainwreck of a disaster. That practically does everything as it pleases, just because of the plot. And here in GF GF, you will never run out of reasons to hate it because of the godforsaken plot, poorly scripted excuses, and the ultimatum of never-ending nonsense moments.<br />
<br />
It is such an awe-inspiring story that demonstrates the harsh path of normalizing cheating in our society. Whereas apparently, all you need is indomitable will and a group of braindead people to play along. The dumber they get, the better your chances of two-timing. Just be brave and keep pushing while throwing tantrums.  Because GF GF has shown us how effective it can be when it comes to love. As they say, people always make stupid decisions when it comes to love. But GF GF just took it to a whole new level and made it as bad as possible. And what scares me the most is the very questionable thoughts of these teenagers. It is so dreadfully bad that calling it stupid is already the mercy of men. It&#039;s not about being right or wrong anymore, but rather, an absolute mess of plunging our society itself into the very depths of absurdity. Where even satanic cults can be looked up as a messiah. How great!<br />
<br />
The plot development is just pure pathetic, as it doesn&#039;t even make it look better. But only to get more ridiculous as time goes by. And at this point, it is more of a cheap gag story that is not even relatively funny for a slice of life rom-com. But hey, you can&#039;t say that! This anime was supposed to be a brainless story from the very beginning. That was the joke, and it truly wasn&#039;t that surprising to see it fail miserably. <br />
<br />
Worse, the characters themselves are entirely another level of a joke. No seriously, just what&#039;s wrong with them? A girlfriend who can compromise with a boyfriend who is two-timing her? The shameless BF stealer? The wannabe generic &quot;Ahh, but I like you too&quot;? The annoying tsundere? Just what kind of abomination ducky duck is GF GF trying to be here? I&#039;m not trying to be dramatic, but was it too much to ask for one genuinely normal and likable character? Oh wait, it is a rom-com series with a comedy + harem tag, so do expect some poorly made characters based on cheap onahole penis instead of real girl personalities. As all they ever do is get horny and embarrassed, they are the perfect example of being downright bad. But of course, it is your usual pathetic excuse to justify them being anime girls as they should. No?<br />
<br />
So where did that leave us? The comedy tag? Really? I haven&#039;t even had a good laugh since I started watching it. Where 90 percent of the screen time is filled with cringe-worthy and outrageous jokes that don&#039;t even make sense in the first place. No, no, and no. It is not at the level of being bad anymore, but pure lunacy that is out of this world. If you are really in need of a good laugh, I&#039;d recommend you Asobi Asobase, Danshi Koukousei, and Grand Blue instead. Because that is what comedy should be about, and at the very least, they were funny. <br />
<br />
Ironically, the show has received too much popularity for its outrageous and endlessly silly jokes alone. That is its only strong point, and there aren&#039;t any other reasons to make it valid for what it is going for. And the romance isn&#039;t as funny or endearing as it could be, making it seem worse than it is. Because it is far from being an enjoyable harem story, plus its stupidity and cringe-worthy moments never end. Perhaps my anticipation and curiosity were too much for GF GF. And despite all the leftovers that the series has the least to offer, it wasn&#039;t much and I can never get past the absurdity fest that it hosts. But I guess it just wasn&#039;t meant for me in the first place.

    2019 had Domestic na Kanojo.<br />
2020 had Kanojo, Okarishimasu.<br />
2021 has Kanojo mo Kanojo.<br />
<br />
We&#039;ve reached peak trash anime. The main character, Naoya, is so cultured that instead of pulling the usual harem trope of choosing best girl at the end of the show (or not at all), he gets TWO girlfriends in the FIRST episode.<br />
<br />
Every year, there is an anime that comes out that is so absolutely rediculous in its plot that it seems like it came straight out of a hentai. Because of this, there will always be a large number of people who do not enjoy these types of shows. However, for people who like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409567">
        trash like I do, these shows are our &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; shows. Kanojo mo Kanojo does not have a complex story or deep meaning, and isn&#039;t something that will make you question life (or maybe it will, but not in a good way), but is just a show that will enteratain and make you laugh once a week.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the trashiness of Domestic na Kanojo or Kanojo, Okarishimasu, this is the Summer 2021 show for you.

    Have you ever watched an anime you hated at first but then came to like it? That&#039;s my exact experience with Kanojo mo Kanojo. &quot;Like&quot; is an understatement though, because I found myself laughing my ass off watching pretty much every episode of the show. Particularly, in a season which has clearly suffered from the &quot;lack of good shit&quot; syndrome, Kanojo mo Kanojo has legitimately been my favorite anime to watch. Yes, legitimately.<br />
<br />
First, let&#039;s get the bad things out of the way. If you don&#039;t enjoy &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;illogical&quot; anime and dislike the seemingly awkward two-timing concept of KmK, chances are that you won&#039;t like the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416982">
        show either. This is very clearly a hit-or-miss series; you are either going to love it or hate it. Even someone like me, who absolutely adores the show now, had a rough time sitting through the first episode. It wasn&#039;t because of the &quot;dumb always equals bad&quot; mentality that most people seem to have, but because of how awkward I found the circumstances to be. There&#039;s another major reason behind my initial dislike for the show, but I will get to that in a bit.<br />
<br />
So what makes KmK good compared to other dumb, &quot;low-effort&quot; harem romcoms out there? For example, what&#039;s different about it compared to something like Osamake? It&#039;s hard to explain. Maybe it&#039;s the fact that KmK actually feels like a genuine parody of harem—opposed to a series that only claims to be a parody while unironically being the exact thing that it attempts to make fun of (Osamake, for instance). The scenarios in KmK are also far more outlandish, with each scenario constantly one-upping the earlier one in terms of ridiculousness. Everything about the show feels like the most cliched trope you could ever imagine—just amplified to an unthinkable extent.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the fact that the characters are actually likeable and entertaining, which is perhaps the biggest difference between KmK and most other harem romcoms.<br />
<br />
The characters are by far the best part of KmK, and they are ultimately what make the awkward premise of the anime somehow work. Yes, most of them are unbelievably stupid, illogical, and sometimes embarrassingly straightforward, but they are entertaining nonetheless. Their apparent lack of braincells doesn&#039;t make them the least bit intolerable; instead, they are more enjoyable because of it. Another praiseworthy side to the characters is that there aren&#039;t many of them; the series only focuses on a select few characters and doesn&#039;t dabble in any sort of unnecessary subplot. This is a rather exceptional feature in harem romcoms, most of which have a tendency to stray away from the original storyline by introducing redundant side-characters and the like.<br />
<br />
However, if you had asked me about my outlook on the characters two months ago, I probably would have given a much different answer, and that&#039;s mostly because of just one guy: Naoya, the protagonist.<br />
<br />
Naoya is a very difficult character to like, and I totally understand why. He is as stupid and clueless as a brick, seemingly very selfish and self-centred, and above all, like Rika describes, he is a &quot;two-timing bastard&quot; who is the root cause of this fucked up situation—but man, is he honest and straightforward. I would have had no qualms punching his face if it had been a few weeks ago, but as the story progressed, I honestly kinda started liking the guy. Not in any conventional way, though. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Naoya doesn&#039;t have any depressing backstory or even a compelling trait that will make you like him, but what he does have is his overly frank and persistent personality and his commitment to keep both of his girlfriends happy, which is admirable in its own way I would say. He will go out of his way to make sure Nagisa and Saki are treated equally, leading to some questionable yet nonetheless hilarious actions. All of this simply makes it very difficult for me to dislike Naoya as a character, albeit I absolutely hated him at the beginning of the story. In the end, he is essentially what makes this show, and I don&#039;t think you would find a better replacement to be honest.<br />
<br />
Enough about Naoya, though, let&#039;s talk about the girls now.<br />
<br />
For starters, Saki is undoubtedly the best girl of the show. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the other three are also very likeable (although Shino gets the spotlight for only like 2 episodes), but Saki&#039;s surprisingly sympathetic persona and unpredictable behaviour makes her the most memorable out of all. But again, all the other girls also deserve to be praised. They all love Naoya for their own reasons and come up various ideas to protect and express their love, which makes you kinda root for all of them—no matter how disastrous the result eventually turns out to be. As the story is now, though, it seems like Saki and Nagisa are the only two potential winners, and I kinda hope that it stays that way to be honest.<br />
<br />
The animation of KmK isn&#039;t exactly top-tier, but it isn&#039;t really bad either. There are a lot kf awkward faces and stiff movements from time to time (that weren&#039;t intentional), but the overall quality of the animation is fine. I like the vibrant color scheme of the show as well, and most importantly, all the girls look very attractive (although their faces may become a bit deformed sometimes—either for comedic purpose or unintentionally).<br />
<br />
Regarding the soundtrack, I thought it was surprisingly good. Some of the tracks that were played on the background were very memorable and, to be honest, caught me off guard. Along with that, KmK easily has one of the best opening and ending themes of this season. The ending song &quot;Pinky Hook&quot; is especially catchy with its outstanding pre-chorus which gets me hooked every time I hear it.<br />
<br />
Kanojo mo Kanojo is easily one of the most enjoyable harems I have ever watched, and there honestly isn&#039;t any sense of irony when I say that. Whether or not it has good writing might be debatable, but one thing&#039;s for sure—it knows how to have fun, it knows how to embrace its stupidity. This kind of unassuming and &quot;not giving a fuck&quot; attitude makes the show a rare find and, in my opinion, a legitimately compelling anime to watch. You wouldn&#039;t find anything remotely meaningful here even with the most rose-tinted glasses, but that doesn&#039;t stop it from being any less enjoyable.<br />
<br />
After all, not all anime are supposed to be deep and rational to be considered genuinely good, and Kanojo mo Kanojo just might be the best example of that.

    	This review contains minor spoilers.<br />
Kanojo mo Kanojo: It would be a great h-anime plot. Is it a good rom-com? – no . Do I watch rom-coms? -no, but still that is some next level tragic. Is there something that I like in the anime? – no, except the opening. Would I recommend it to anyone? – no.  Why? … :<br />
	Art: 6/10<br />
The art is nothing special, but it really fits the genre. The animation is sometimes poorly made, but that’s because the anime is ‘comedy’, so they put these ‘really funny’ awkward animations (which I  genuinely hate). Everything is bright and colorful like every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409583">
        modern rom-com. I won’t add the art score to the overall one, because I don’t think that the art can hide the pathetic characters and story.<br />
	Sound: 6/10<br />
The opening is the only thing that I like in this anime. Its not really good or something, its okay and it fits the genre too. It shows everything we need to know about the anime. The music in the anime is sometimes not in the right place. For example  when Saki left Naoya’s house the music was really sad like someone died or something  and I don’t think that that was ironic. But overall the anime has mediocre background music which for the most part fits the situations in which the characters are. I don’t like the ending song, but it shows that Naoya likes every girl body except Saki’s, but at the end of the day he likes Saki too. I wonder how much effort it took for the creator’s mind to create such a complicated plot.<br />
	 Character: 1/10<br />
Although I haven’t seen all of the characters, I am still rating them 1. Naoya is autistic, but somehow is good in school. Saki makes really funny mistakes and jokes that get me dying on the floor every single time. Its really sad how the only source of comedy is Saki and its not even funny. Nagisa just exist as a cute anime girl with a personality of a – cute anime girl, so : easily predictable character. But I know, that’s a rom-com there mustn&#039;t be any complicated characters, all of them must be dumb as a rock and have 2 feelings – happy and embarrassed. All of the characters that I have seen are pathetic and forgettable.<br />
	Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
Some of the people that have watched these 4 episodes find it “so bad, that it is actually good”, it’s not. It is so bad that it is actually bad. I find it boring, because of the poorly made characters and a plot, that only relies on characters. So what happens when an anime relies on only ONE thing that is pretty bad, well, it fails to be an interesting series  for some viewers. But I can understand people that actually like this thing. If you like cute anime girls and cringy anime moments, this sh*t is for you.<br />
<br />
BUUUT, if you are someone like me, you know that this is just tragic. <br />

    This anime is hilarious, and don&#039;t feel pressured by anime &quot;standards&quot; to hide your true feelings if you think so too. <br />
<br />
Let me pose a question. What is the reason why we watch anime, and on a larger spectrum, consume all varieties of media? Is it so we can critically dissect all of the aspects of a show and nitpick on all of its faults? While I&#039;m sure this can be...fun?...for some (and a headache for others haha), I don&#039;t think so. It&#039;s because of entertainment. We crave excitement, something that can function as a brief escape from our realities and act as a stimulus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416989">
        for our minds. That to me is the key component of all media, regardless of genre. While there are a variety of factors that can contribute to a work of fiction being a success, to me it ultimately boils down to two things: Does it keep me interested and do I enjoy watching it? And let me tell you, Kanojo mo Kanojo is easily one of the most entertaining anime that I&#039;ve seen in years! <br />
<br />
The premise is stupid. The execution of the story is stupid. The characters and their actions are stupid. And I absolutely love it. Contrary to popular belief, an anime does not in fact have to be on a scale of epic proportions or contain beautifully written symbolism to be good. Besides, that would limit creativity and expressionism if everybody tried to write similarly. We gotta expand our horizons and get a little more diversity! To me, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a success because I was able to enjoy the heck out of it despite its simplistic, limited, and in ALL cases, silly content.<br />
<br />
So the show pretty much revolves around the premise of the main dude two timing, and the biggest plot development involves another girl trying to get him to be a three timer. Oh boy! This is one of those weird ideas that I doubt you would see any other country bar Japan dare attempt to implement in their works because of all of the potential controversies. Japan doesn&#039;t give a crap of course because Japanese people are seemingly just too badass to care. But hey, this anime doesn&#039;t attempt to glorify polygamy like other certain anime seemingly try to paint other negative practices like slavery in a positive light, so I don&#039;t really care what the ideas used are as long as they&#039;re utilized appropriately in the narrative. And to me, it works because of the absurd way that the cast deals with it. <br />
<br />
The characters do not act like normal people. Naoya is beyond dense and loves to shout everything he thinks out loud. He also tries WAAAAY too hard at everything. The man has no stop button or shame, but it&#039;s great. He stands out because of how ridiculous he is, and this dude&#039;s antics never failed to crack me up. Whether it&#039;s *Gasp*...HAND HOLDING...with two girls out in public while screaming about his love for them or forgoing his pants so he can make a point, Naoya&#039;s over the top nature really makes him memorable, and his amazing voice acting certainly helps. <br />
<br />
Saki is Naoya&#039;s initial girlfriend, and my personal favorite character in the show. As her good friend Shino puts it, Saki is stupid. And you know what? That&#039;s ok!!! I absolutely love the chemistry between Saki and Naoya, their moments had me burst out laughing on various occasions. I&#039;m glad that she at least tried to fight the whole two timing thing for awhile, but eventually caved in because her, Naoya, and Nagisa were simply made to be in a love triangle...no really, that&#039;s how the author wrote it. But truth be told, it&#039;s primarily because she&#039;s a baka. And she&#039;s also big pushover who was easily won over by Nagisa. I was honestly surprised at how lewd Saki was and especially the way her horniness (Wait, is this a real word?) was portrayed. I&#039;m used to anime girls being like &quot;Oho! I&#039;m going to get him to look at my slightly exposed cleavage! How perverted!!!&quot; But Saki over here is just like &quot;I want sex and can&#039;t stop thinking about it&quot; while still being fidgety and nervous about it all because she has no experience. Which I weirdly respect and, I dunno, somehow find more realistic and endearing? Yeah, maybe I&#039;m just a baka myself. This anime seems to push the ecchi levels further than most with things like this, and that little extra nudge helps make it stand out to me. Saki&#039;s various comedic expressions and reactions to the insanity that is this anime are great. Plus the absolutely phenomenal voice acting for her really helped to elevate Saki&#039;s character even more. Seriously though, why are the seiyuu in this anime so darn good!?<br />
<br />
The other characters are fun too. Nagisa is the reason why the whole plot THICCens in the first place by confessing to Naoya. As you can imagine, everything about her is turned up to 11, such as the fact that she has to put in thousands of hours of effort into things just to try and be average at them. I can only imagine that this is because, like the rest of this anime, Nagisa is stupid. But hey, she&#039;s an excellent cook, so there&#039;s that!!! Milika is a girl who appears in order to move the plot along, which makes sense since she has, uh, a, b, c, d, e, f...G-reat PLOT, if ya know what I mean~ Her dedication to getting Naoya to fall for her is admirable, if not borderline insane. I was worried that her antics might start to lesson my enjoyment of the show, but the reverse happened. She has plenty of funny moments and I&#039;ll be rooting for her to turn this two way anime into a THREE way anime!!! The last girl to mention is Saki&#039;s elegant friend Shino, who is anything but elegant in her one big scene. She hasn&#039;t appeared much, but if her short yet amazingly anime-esque confrontation with Naoya is anything to go by, she has a lot of potential...just not in her chest. Gah, I tried to hold back, but I couldn&#039;t, I&#039;m sorry. But anyway, here&#039;s hoping Studio Tezuka Productions will get on that second season!!!<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s anything you can take away from my review, it&#039;s this. Please, don&#039;t take this show seriously. You&#039;ll only hurt yourself if you try to, trust me. Logic simply doesn&#039;t exist in this series, just like how boing boing doesn&#039;t exist on Saki&#039;s flat chest and how opinions don&#039;t exist in the minds of ignorant people.....ok, I couldn&#039;t decide which comparison to use since the first one makes me seem perverted and the second one makes me come across as rude. So naturally, I decided to use both of them. Why?<br />
<br />
Because I&#039;m stupid. Just like this anime. So in the end, maybe that&#039;s why I feel such a connection to it...<br />

    “I have a girlfriend. But then another girl confessed her feelings to me. What should I do?”<br />
<br />
If you’re somehow placed in that kind of situation, what would you do? I mean, the answer should be obvious, right? Just turn her down and stay loyal to your ‘childhood friend that took years to get’ girlfriend, but that’s not the case for the main character, Naoya.<br />
<br />
First of all, I didn’t read the manga, so it’s based on what I see in the first four episodes. I won’t hop much into the details, so I’ll just say what matters. <br />
<br />
The anime started off with a girl named Minase

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409568">
        confessing her feelings to Naoya. He came up with a conclusion and said, “So I want you in my life. I won&#039;t turn you down, but I can&#039;t betray my girlfriend, so can I date both of you?” I mean, at this point, you could probably already tell on how dumb of a person Naoya is. Also, it’s also kind of ironic that he said that right after he babbled on how much he loves his girlfriend and how happy he is to have her. What’s even dumber is that Minase agreed with him and was completely okay with it. In the end, they both came up to his girlfriend, Saki, to talk things and convince her out.<br />
<br />
This is where things got even worse, or should I say interesting. Saki denied at first, but after a few arguments here and there, she agreed upon the idea of being two timed. They ended up living at the same house together. Yes, you heard it right, three of them living in the same house. What could go wrong? Well, everything. Because of the situation, a competition was set in stone. Both Saki and Minase were competing with each other to see who would win Naoya’s heart the most. <br />
<br />
I’m not a fan of the story. It’s just too absurd that my brain can’t even comprehend it anymore, and that’s mainly because of Naoya, the character I hate the most. But lucky for me, he had to bear the result of his own selfishness and stupidity. He needed to maintain equal affection and love to both of the main heroines. Speaking of the main heroines, I fell in love with them. They’re cute and unique in their own way. Their voice actor plays an important role in bringing out their persona more. Characters aside, the comedy aspect in this show is so godly that I laughed my ass off on literally every episode. For that reason, I’m giving an overall score of seven for this series.<br />
<br />
Edit: Maybe I&#039;ll try to make a different review once the anime ends.

    Polygamy is a difficult subject. Animes prove this. Harem shows try to treat their romances with increasingly repetitive approaches and at the same time don&#039;t know what to do often when it comes to finishing a show. Authors and storyboard creators have the difficult task of concluding the story and convincing the audience at the same time. Kanojo mo Kanojo arrived bringing a very different form of love that exceeds a couple, putting on a relationship that, while seeming innovative and different, demonstrates how lostand desperate romance animes are these days. <br />
<br />
For those who don&#039;t know, &quot;polygamy&quot; is an emotional relationship in a group with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416980">
        more than 2 people. This kind of thing is still a controversial debate, because it not only involves the group of people involved, but also the entire external society that expresses this relationship in a negative way most of the times. Usually, acceptance comes with difficulty, which is fair enough. In the show, after receiving a girl&#039;s confession, Naoya proposes to Nagisa a relationship between 3 people. Naoya had from the beginning of the story a fling with Sakisaki, while Nagisa would be his second girlfriend. Sakisaki, like every person who has a normal functioning head, refuses at first sight the awkward and uncomfortable situation. Hearing this proposal from her own boyfriend is like receiving a betrayal, even if it doesn&#039;t seem like it. Having to share a closed relationship with another person in this way is something that really needs patience and understanding. Even with this, Sakisaki accepts living with Naoya and Nagisa in this way.<br />
So far, the show looks cool, it&#039;s an idea that if it&#039;s put to good use, can cause interesting moments and messages, even with this distortion within what is meant by a harmonious relationship. The problem of Kanojo mo Kanojo is actually not this, but the progression of the show added to the difficult to follow coexistences during the episodes. At first, the anime tries to turn this perception into a difficult state until it is something the audience accepts as normal. But the show chose not to do that competently.<br />
<br />
In fact, much of what the show has done is leave in hyperbolic drama moments that are just absurd and wouldn&#039;t cause that much amazement (remember, this is a show that wants to try to make a relationship between three people natural). You don&#039;t need to see much of the anime to identify this. From a hug request to the involvement of a fourth person in the story (in this case, Mirika), the direction of the anime puts the most frivolous and the most absurd moments into pure bliss, as if they were something similar. The way the show approaches this causes outrage with those watching. Imagine you see Naoya hugging Nagisa in front of Sakisaki while she feels a euphoria because she thinks she is developing a fetish, or imagine being surprised by a girl dressed as a rabbit or a maid in front of you. These things are really seen as odd, but they have turned this kind of attempt to relate the characters in a way that hurts the show itself. Honestly, putting a background with green and purple colors to cause a character&#039;s astonishment is not amusing, but pathetic. More than pathetic, it is a laziness of the show to innovate. What was supposed to cause humor by what you are seeing, causes laughter by the absurd way the studio decided to do some scenes.<br />
<br />
And on the subject of innovation, Kanojo mo Kanojo is actually not a revolutionary anime, but an increasingly common cliché in manga, light novels and harem shows. One can see the increasingly bad trend of stories being poorly reworked and often concluded with contempt from the creator of the project himself. Without quoting spoilers of the endings of these manga, but &quot;Gotoubun no Hanayome&quot;, &quot;Domestic na Kanojo&quot; and &quot;Bokuben&quot; were recent examples of adaptations that even having a conclusion did not please and in most cases caused a bad reception about the genre. When making a show of this kind, I imagine that the author needs to have the ability to conclude his work in a way that sparks interest in consuming other projects by him or the magazine he distributes, but unfortunately this does not happen. Kanojo mo Kanojo is not guilty of this trend, perhaps it was even the original idea of the show to be like this. But that doesn&#039;t take away from the responsibility to change the parameters of this demographic that is declining year after year. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not like the whole show is flawed, particularly some episodes and scenes are cool to follow, but they can&#039;t sustain everything else. These isolated cases are like gold found in a desert. You will feel accomplished, but all you will notice around you is misery. The misery of this show is the limitations of a better contact with the viewer. For many times I realized that the anime, instead of trying to be more casual or even slice of life, it uncontrollably tries to use already repeated, banal and unnecessary subjects to extend and perhaps create more time with this awkward involvement. Whenever it has some drama regarding a character&#039;s insecurity, their breasts are one of the first factors to be told, or the girl being pretty, or even the relationship of it being a story where more than 2 people have a love involvement. <br />
<br />
Finally, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a disappointment, but a planned disappointment. You wouldn&#039;t expect anything good in a show that once again has &quot;Kanojo&quot; in its title (need I mention that this is getting more and more worrisome?), but at least I thought the humor and charm of the anime would be enough to withstand 12 episodes. Well, that&#039;s not what occurred. It&#039;s a show that has damaged itself and gone from &quot;innovative&quot; to just &quot;weird&quot;.<br />

    Absolutely horrible anime, top notch cringe fest. 2/10 for the attempt.<br />
<br />
Is this the first guy in history to discover a harem? Apparently, yes, given how he seems to behave.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10. Absolutely pathetic.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10. Art is decent, nice drawings, outlines are clear and scenes are nicely decorated. Nice fan service.<br />
<br />
Music: 8/10. Nice music, you feel like in a shounen at times, and it&#039;s the only funny thing in the show when it&#039;s contrasting the actual development.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10. Absolute cringe. I was clawing my eyes out scene after scene. Nobody acts sane in this show. This is some madman&#039;s fantasy. You turn your brain off after a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410112">
        while, and just let this stream directly into your soul.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10. I would rather grind my fingers in a meatgrinder than watch this again.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10. Just barely better than staring at a blank wall.

    This is my first and likely only review so sorry if its bad<br />
<br />
I think there is some sort of misconception among the viewers of Kanojo mo Kanojo that it is a bad anime. What exactly is &quot;bad&quot; and what isn&#039;t is entirely up to you to decide by yourself. So why do most people think Kanojo mo Kanojo is bad? Its because of pretty much everything it has to offer. They don&#039;t like the characters and how over the top and stupid they are. They don&#039;t like how cringe the show becomes at times and how hard it could become to watch. Its exactly these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417035">
        traits that make this anime so great in my opinion. It seems that there are a surprising amount of people that are not aware that this is a gag anime. Gag anime aren&#039;t really meant to be taken seriously they are meant to make you laugh. So is it really fair to rate a gag anime the same way you would rate a normal anime? Thats why most of the criticism this anime gets actually ends up being some of its biggest strengths. The over the top characters and cringe moments only contribute to what this show is at heart: a gag anime. <br />
<br />
Art:10 <br />
<br />
For a show to have good &quot;art&quot; it doesn&#039;t only need to actually look good it also needs to be unique and rememberable. It doesn&#039;t matter how good an anime looks if i feel like i have already seen it 10 times before i wont like it. Kanojo mo Kanojo definitely doesn&#039;t do that. Its art is rather simple but extremely unique. Its very colorful and never makes me bored at looking the the screen. Not only does the art looks good it also fits very well with the wacky nature of the anime. You can give kyoani levels of art in this anime but i still think i would end up preferring this one.<br />
<br />
Sound:10 <br />
<br />
Kanojo mo Kanojo&#039;s sound track is amazing. Much of it is very vibrant and fun and fits very well in the show. One particular track i liked was the one that played in the beginning of most of the episodes telling a quick recap of the last. It always got me ready for the craziness that is Kanojo mo Kanojo. Both the op and ed are phenomenal and some of my top picks for the best opening and ending of the summer season. One of the best parts of it all though is the voice acting. It helps exaggerate the jokes even more than even its parent manga never could. Overall this anime has all i could ever ask for in the sound department. <br />
<br />
Characters:10 <br />
<br />
Now onto my favorite part and the favorite of many: The Characters. This anime has one of if the best cast i have ever seen. Now i&#039;m not really a fan of harem anime in general and one key reason why is the protagonist. Most harem protagonist are devoid of any sort of personality and are too scared to actually take any action. Naoya the protagonist of this anime is anything but that. Naoya is an extremely straightforward and stupid person and will almost always say whats on his mind regardless of the situation. Most of the time this straightforward personality of his leads to rather comical scenarios involving him and his girlfriend&#039;s. He is also honest to a fault and almost always tells the truth even if it would destroy his reputation. But on top of all he deeply cares about his two girlfriend&#039;s and isn&#039;t embarrassed at all to admit it. Unlike your average harem protagonists who is too embarrassed to even think about the thought of love. Naoya is probably the most unique harem protagonist i have ever seen and i&#039;m all for it. Besides the the protagonist there are the four heroines. Saki is Naoya&#039;s childhood friend and first girlfriend. Saki is generally a very energetic and cheerfully girl. She can also be kind of violent at times and usually punches Naoya when he is being stupid. In most anime a girl assaulting the male lead would come off as annoying but not in this anime with its more comical tone. Also to be fair most of the time Naoya kind of deserves it. She is also pretty stupid herself and extremely forgetful at times. This personality of hers honestly makes many scenes of the anime a lot funnier and it wouldn&#039;t be the same with someone different. Saki honestly is the perfect character for this type of anime and my personal favorite one. Next is Nagisa Naoya&#039;s other girlfriend. Nagisa is generally timid and kind girl. She also seems to have a talent for blackmailing people. Just like Naoya and Saki she is very stupid. I am normally not a fan of characters like Nagisa because of there repetitiveness and lack of action. Nagisa however isn&#039;t afraid to take action to help win over Naoya and is generally pretty different from your average dandere. Next is up is Rika or &quot;Mirika&quot; as she is commonly referred to in the anime. An easy way i can describe her is you know &quot;Nino&quot; from &quot;The Quintessential Quintuplets&quot;. Mirika is pretty much an improved version of her. Just like Nino, Mirika is a tsundere who isn&#039;t afraid to take action to win over affection. Both are very refreshing takes on a tsundere and pretty great characters in their own right. One thing people criticize Nino for in her own anime is that she is rather &quot;annoying&quot;. Now Mirika isn&#039;t really any different but what is different is her setting. The Quintessential Quintuplets is a harem anime at heart and Kanojo mo Kanojo is a gag anime at heart. Mirika annoying antics at the end of the day only help the anime even more rather the drag it down. Last but not least we have Shino. Now in all honestly i don&#039;t have too much to day about Shino as she has by far gotten the least screen time out of all the characters. But from what i have seen she is a pretty amazing character. Shino is the best friend of Saki and begins to follow Naoya around once she suspects that he is two timing Saki. She is a very serious character which is honestly a nice contrast to how wacky this  anime is. Overall i really really love these characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 11 <br />
<br />
Anime&#039;s main purpose is for you to enjoy. I feel like most people have forgotten that the more anime they watch. Things like art and characters are only factors to our overall enjoyment at the end of the day. So did i enjoy this anime? Yeah. Out of the 27 different anime i watched this season this is the one that i enjoyed the most. This anime is also really funny like a gag anime is supposed to be if that wasn’t obvious yet. Im sure most people have also realized this by now but this anime really isn&#039;t meant to be taken seriously. You just have to relax and have fun. If you try and search this show for its flaws i’m sure you will find plenty. But i could honestly care less about them. All i know is that i really enjoyed this show and i&#039;m sad it&#039;s over. <br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
<br />
I laughed a lot. <br />
I had lots of fun.<br />
Season 2 pls.

    KanoKano is the definitive fulfilment of the harem romcom idea. For years I’ve waited for a romcom series with an MC who’s not afraid of women, embraces their advances and takes risks. Finally, after all this time I have one.<br />
<br />
While the above may seem hyperbolic, I can’t emphasise enough how much I love KanoKano. From episode one I was hooked. The waifus, humour, lack of traditional harem cliches and genuinely hilarious comedy made it one of the most enjoyable anime I’ve seen in a long time. For the entire season this has been the show I look towards the most weekly. It’s not for everyone.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417003">
        If you want character development, quality writing and all that other jazz, you won’t find it here. If you’re able to turn your brain off and realise not everything has to be Shakespearean, then you’ll love this.<br />
<br />
The cast is small, but very intimate. They don’t get fleshed out too much, but the character interactions are awesome. The chemistry between the main girls and the MC was an absolute joy to watch. It’s rare to have anime be actually funny. A lot of Japanese jokes tend to be cringe to me, but this show is one of the few that pulls it off. I think if you enjoyed the humour of Oresuki you’ll like this one.<br />
<br />
As I briefly touched on before, the main selling point for me is the fact that the MC actually embraces his role as a harem protag. So often in these types of shows you have guys like Issei from DxD who talk about how horny they are, yet run from girls or are afraid to touch them, kiss, etc. Naoya in this is the complete opposite. Remains extremely stoic and composed through pretty much everything, straight up asks his girlfriend if he can date another girl, etc. It was just a massive breath of fresh air and I really wish we would get more of these types of series. For some reason, many mangaka think boys are afraid of women as teenagers. <br />
<br />
The art is really nice in this show. I love the bright colour palette as well as the character designs. One of my favourites of the year both artistically and overall.<br />
<br />
KanoKano will probably end with a mediocre score on MAL, but that’s to be expected given people tend to think everything has to be extremely deep and that everything needs character development. Regardless, it’s an extremely enjoyable harem with loveable characters and great humour. Can’t recommend it enough. <br />
<br />
KanoKano gets 10 Metubers out of 10.

    Kanojo mo Kanojo may sound like a generic and irritating romantic comedy, but what&#039;s hidden underneath is ONE OF the few works that can be called a deconstruction of romance.<br />
<br />
HOW INCREDIBLE ANIME MY FRIENDS, in my opinion, this animation is definitly the best one in this season, simple and pretty.<br />
<br />
The story is the opposite of cliche, there are a lot of elements that show to us HOW GOOD is this anime<br />
<br />
AND OF COURSE, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT NAOYA, the proutagonist, that guy is in another level , He is a kind of god that thinks Japan is an arabian country.<br />
<br />
The anime is still in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409817">
        the forth episode, I cant talk too much about, but what I see will continue for the rest of the animation And this show will finally beat Full Metal Brotherhood.

     This anime is quality. Its story points may not be the most original. &#039;Average Japanese school boy getting a harem&#039; - doesn&#039;t sound too inspiring, but as it turned out you don&#039;t need to make insanely original premise for a work of fiction to be enjoyable.<br />
<br />
So, this anime turned out to be really well made and this is why:<br />
<br />
1) Humor is on point as it&#039;s not too trashy and not too boring - perfect balance. It&#039;s a bit on a &#039;weeby&#039; side with its fan service and Japanese culture. But it still should be pretty watchable for normie people.<br />
<br />
2) This anime is easy to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417026">
        watch. It&#039;s &#039;believable&#039; and characters feel alive. It&#039;s not some obscure stuff which could be hard to follow.<br />
<br />
3) Art and sound - all good, no eye piercing CGI. Picture has unique art style and nice color palette.<br />
<br />
4) Pacing of the story feels good. The episodes don&#039;t feel rushed or slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
If you want to watch something nice then this is the choice of the season. 10/10 anime, its only problem is that we will never see its characters to become adults, as I have a feeling it would have transformed from romcom to drama *real quick*

    If there was a show that perfectly sums up Gigguk&#039;s self-deprecating humour phrase of &quot;Anime is Trash, and so am I.&quot;, it would be Kanojo mo Kanojo. If you&#039;ve ever watched or read Aho Girl some years back and thought that it was obscenely weird, this show at least matches the comedy levels of Mangaka-san to Assistant-san, but better in every way imaginable. BTW, those works I&#039;ve mentioned are all from the same author that is Hiroyuki, best known for the creation of many Doujinshi based on the Type-Moon visual novels Tsukihime and Fate/stay night. This man of culture is simply a genius at knowing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416985">
        how to create works worth simping for, and Kanojo mo Kanojo may be the best peak trash work he&#039;s ever done. Sanity check? Nah, why the hell not?<br />
<br />
Kanojo mo Kanojo a.k.a Girlfriend, Girlfriend is a &quot;so bad it&#039;s good&quot; of a trash rom-com harem manga, but I&#039;d not think to see that with the anime, it basically levelled up the cringe by a substantial amount, and that IMO, it actually made the anime adaptation the superior version of the manga. Talk about some good ol&#039; wine brewing of gag comedy that&#039;s just waiting to elevate its taste to cater to us, the trash-loving audience who appreciates that anime can not be taken seriously and just serviced to have a good time. Also, don&#039;t try to douse the serious watcher with &quot;anime logic&quot;, if you&#039;re thinking of that while watching this show, then it&#039;s clearly not geared towards your taste. Anime can be made intentionally dumb, and Kanojo mo Kanojo is one of the better AniManga &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; work that dumbs down on that dumbness to give everyone laughs, one that&#039;s not of joking levels of satire nor trolling.<br />
<br />
That said though, I&#039;m seriously and genuinely thankful that in such a dry and paltry season as Summer 2021 can be, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a breath of fresh air just for the one thing that is missing: some dank comedy for potential memes. Otome Game being the same but less funny, Uramichi Oniisan being a hit-and-miss dark comedy, while this show just puts a tongue-in-cheek smile on my face with each passing episode that raises its rediculousness to levels of insanity from a simple concept such as a boy-and-girl relationship. Because if 2019&#039;s Domestic na Kanojo (a.k.a Domestic Grlfriend) hasn&#039;t made the point that two-timing in a relationship can be done, and 2020&#039;s Kanojo, Okarishimasu. (a.k.a Rent-A-Girlfriend) bringing the point about girls chasing after the MC while he chases after the main girl, Kanojo mo Kanojo will indefnitely strap you on the chair to make sure of the fact that the immoral combination of these 2 shows into one concept is a reality that you cannot unsee. And that your pair of eyes are tainted forever to be trained to watch more wack, trashy shows.<br />
<br />
SO... *clap* some teaching time! You need to distinguish what&#039;s the difference between polygamy and polyamory. Polygamy is the marriage of multiple partners, while polyamory is the relationship version of that, and that easily sums up the MC of this series: Naoya Mukai. Him and his childhood friend Saki Saki get together in the usual, typical relationship process, but another girl by the name of Nagisa Minase seeks him out to confess to him, and lo and behold, the chad does the impossible: to have a two-timing relationship of a love triangle between him, Saki and Nagisa. On that account, there are 2 more girls that will eventually come after Naoya&#039;s ass (Rika Hoshizaki who goes by her MeTuber alias &quot;Milika&quot;, and Sakisaki&#039;s best friend Shino Kiryu), but at this point, Naoya is hell bent on just being comfortable with the current love triangle, while both girls Saki and Nagisa often compromising for each other so that they get what they wished for. All the hijinks and shenanigans that you&#039;ve ever come across when watching harems and rom-coms are presented here, and the best part is that Naoya is being shameless and proud AF like a boy who&#039;s down for the horny aspect, but at least has a heart that&#039;s for the pure dedication of the polyamoric status just for the two-timing situation. Also, he likes bananas, just like Aho Girl&#039;s Akuru &quot;A-kun&quot; Akutsu.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s not to say that the 4 centre girls had nothing going for them though. Not counting for the LOLS that all 5 of them could make an inherent reference being Super (Hentai) Sentai characters (like in Dokyuu Hentai HxEros a.k.a Super HxEros), it&#039;s be best to categorize all 4 girls as such: Saki is the red-ribboned, most stupid, gullible and easily NTR&#039;ed if cheated on; Nagisa is the blue-ribboned sweet and charming classmate that has some degree of boobs that a tad bigger than Saki&#039;s; Rika is purely the yellow-ribboned vlogger and stalker who can&#039;t for the life of all, give up the &quot;love of her life&quot; from being shown the light like Naoya&#039;s her Jesus-kun; and Shino the purple-ribboned, confused AF looking girl whom is a lot hard-headed about what a typiccal relationship is, and questioning Naoya about Saki being potentially cheated on. A bit of a spoiler alert that all 4 of them would fall for Naoya a few heads in the manga where the anime ended thereafter, and this only makes the equation more fulfilling for more blushes and comedic banter of a polyamory relationship that&#039;s filled with idiocies across the board. And that&#039;s all you need to grasp of this &quot;Love is War&quot; rhethoric that&#039;s different from Kaguya-sama.<br />
<br />
On the production side, Tezuka Productions has seen better days, and it&#039;s a small comeback for real. Let&#039;s be real here: last season&#039;s co-produced Isekai Maou sequel was a return on the action side of things, and that felt like it was a haphazard move on delivering a somewhat lower quality show that the studio just couldn&#039;t get right. So, what to do? In-house director Satoshi Kuwahara takes what is good about that and dumps that into here, which I feel that the execution is much more palatable and better suited overall to provide better gag comedic sequences. Together with another in-house series composer Keiichirou Oochi, the studio itself is in good hands delivering slice-of-life and light-hearted shows at its best. It&#039;s no wonder Gotoubun no Hanayome a.k.a The Quintessential Quintuplets and Adachi to Shimamura have somewhat similar vibes to deliver a softer palette to squeeze every bit of eye-catching visuals that looking aesthetically pleasing.<br />
<br />
Also, the OST for this show is quite the catchy one. I&#039;m a sucker for peppy songs that sound like they have a resounding beat to it overall, and both the OP and ED delivered on that promise to add to an already guilty pleasure of a show. Can I just say that for the OP, the visuals represent a lot of triangles, but even hint at the Fibonacci &quot;Golden Ratio&quot;, which is the most beautiful number in the universe. This gives the fact that no matter how Naoya may be stressed up at picking which girl (or girls in this case) to date, there is not just one single catch that these 4 girls are unique of, and each of them are worth dating in that right. The ED itself is no different from illustrating the childish frustrations and fanservice of the 4 girls towards Naoya in the classic rom-com style, and I like these kind of creative touches. So good.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, Kanojo mo Kanojo raises the bar for the unspoken &quot;whack, trash perception&quot; genre of anime by a hair, and it&#039;s very indicative of a show where it just presents you with never-ending amounts of silliness and jokes it like to repeat, and it never once gets stale. Thank you Hiroyuki for creating this manga and Tezuka Productions for translating the adaptation onto the small screen, my life is so much happier now that we can fulfill our wet dreams of being like chad Naoya to attain that polyamory relationship with a strong will. So joke away and be shameless about having lots of mistresses like something out of a Hentai plot, because one day you might end up like Naoya for wish fulfillment reasons. Definitely reommended if you want to experience something fictional that you can almost never experience in real life.

    This might sound absurd.... BUT I ACTUALLY LOVED THIS SHOW!<br />
<br />
The show is given a bad rep becuz of the fact that it is cringe. I think that this show&#039;s main appeal is that it&#039;s cringe and it is fine to be cringe. I bet a lot of people treat this show as a typical romcom or a more story based anime, but in fact I would recommend this show to watch as a purely comedic standpoint, and ignore all the other details.<br />
<br />
I get that this show is by no means a masterpiece of a series, but in my heart all the things that I&#039;ve experienced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409679">
        so far, is PURE gold. Story is 10 if you don&#039;t think about it too much, art is impeccable to say the least, the op and ed slaps HARD.<br />
<br />
My character rating might be controversial because it is. I personally believe that every character in this series is AMAZING. Naoya is the chad he is. He is MEANT to be cringe, fight me. I will highly suggest all of you to look at the characters as fictional, and act fictional cause it is meant that way. You can&#039;t think of any real situation that a guy would accept another girl after already having one (well except if you&#039;re cheating. anti-NTR LESGOO!! Cheating is the real cringe). Don&#039;t get me started with the rest of the girls.<br />
<br />
I genuinely enjoy this show! It&#039;s probably the top show this season other than the continuation gold and other golds like this one. I really would suggest all of you to try this show out, and to look at this show like a comedic movie or something, that doesn&#039;t focus on the story and the story is complementing the comedic elements like the characters&#039; behavior, comedic situations, etc.<br />
<br />
10/10<br />
REMEMBER THAT THIS SHOW HAS A BAD REP CUZ OF THE UNCOMEDIC PEOPLE THAT SEES THINGS TOO SERIOUSLY.*<br />
<br />
*well if you don&#039;t find it funny then by no means drop this show, comedy is subjective anyways

    Have you ever dated a girl so insecure, your relationship was plagued with codependence, suspicion, and all-around toxicity?<br />
<br />
Have you ever dated two of them /at the same time/?<br />
<br />
Kanojo mo Kanojo is an incredible piece of art that deconstructs the harem genre by introducing a protagonist who establishes his harem in the first episode - and in no ambiguous terms either. By allowing MC Naoya to officially date not just one, but two high school girls, the show will be heralded for years after as the harbinger of polyamory in modern romcom anime. Absolutely nothing can go wrong with this premise!<br />
<br />
Enter Saki, the OG (Original Girlfriend).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409660">
        VA Ayane Sakura does an incredible job of portraying this high school girl whose feisty character is enough to hide the fact that she is the epitome of an easily peer-pressured pushover. In true high school fashion, she is guilt-tripped time after time again into accepting things in her relationship that no self-respecting person would tolerate. Her running gag is being heavily physically violent, and honestly, who wouldn&#039;t be in this situation?<br />
<br />
Enter Nagisa, the New Girlfriend. Even when played out for laughs, the concept of a girl so codependent on a boy she isn&#039;t even dating yet, and for which she would be willing to be so self-sacrificing for, is beyond alarming. For some reason, the author believes that making her character traits &quot;astoundingly terrible at certain things and alarmingly dedicated to others&quot; is still considered moe by 2021 romcom standards (or even worse, the author thinks this is a funny gag).  In a groundbreaking development of the nice moe cooking girlfriend, we learn that her insecurities lie deep enough to inspire her to break into her boyfriend&#039;s and sister wife&#039;s phones.<br />
<br />
And finally enter, Naoya, the Boyfriend. Some may say he is a Chad who isn&#039;t afraid to ask for what he wants. Unfortunately, it is hardly Chad behavior to repeatedly grovel before your committed girlfriend and beg for forgiveness after every social transgression you purposely crossed, and it is hardly good comedy for this to be the slapstick punchline three times per episode.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I&#039;m just old and jaded, perhaps it&#039;s because high school romcom anime were never supposed to be psycho-analyzed; but the rampant toxicity of this polyamorous relationship is incredibly exhausting and any viewer who believes the behavior of these characters is acceptable, even for laughs, needs to re-evaluate their idea of social norms. While the initial concept and erratic logic processes of the characters lead to an &quot;it&#039;s so bad it&#039;s good&quot; start to the show, by episode 4, the comedy is already overdone and you&#039;re left feeling annoyed at why all these women are written so catty. The only real saving grace in this show - and its comedy - is VA Ayane Sakura&#039;s natural tsukkomi deliveries.<br />
<br />
The art and designs are fine for a manga adaptation of this type, but the production quality and animation noticeably start deteriorating a few episodes in.<br />
<br />
Overall, given the plethora of recent rage-inducing romance anime featuring an unhealthy relationship (Nagatoro, Rent-a-Girlfriend, Sing Yesterday for Me), this one really takes the cake. Because now there&#039;s two unhealthy relationships at the same time.<br />
<br />
3/10, this show is terrible but at least I got some enjoyment being angry at this show.

    This anime is amazing. I went into this show without knowing anything about it and enjoyed it immensely. This is a hilarious anime about a man that does his best to make the girls he cares about happy.<br />
<br />
If I was to describe what really make this show great it would be the characters. The ridiculous premise definitely helps, but really it&#039;s the characters that do a fantastic job of taking that premise and maximizing the comedy. The characters all look great, are very well voice acted, and have great interactions with each other. Even the main male character added a lot to the show by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417028">
        being a very atypical protagonist for this type of show. He&#039;s a man that knows what&#039;s important to him and fights to protect it regardless of conventional morals and without concern about how other people would view it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throughout this entire show I was never bored and often could not completely predict what was going to happen next. There is so much creativity and hilarity in this show that I was thoroughly entertained and laughing the whole time. Kanojo mo Kanojo is my favorite show of the season and I hope more people give the show a chance.

    Remember when harem anime used to be memorable? Anime like High School DxD and The Familiar of Zero established a fanbase and continues to this day. In recent years, we had an onslaught of underwhelming harem shows. I legit can&#039;t remember the last time I found a harem anime that can even be remotely recommendable. That is...until I ran into Kanojo no Kanojo.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake. This anime is exactly what it sounds like from the premise and it doesn&#039;t shy to exmplify that. Meet Naoya Mukai, the high school student who somehow got involved with not one but two girls in a dramatic love triangle.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416999">
        This sounds like every healthy high school male student&#039;s fantasy. For Naoya, his brutal honesty doesn&#039;t hold him back to express such feelings and attraction. In fact, the show sells his personality at best when he dives right into his interactions with the female cast. Yes, this anime is a harem and he&#039;s living the dream.<br />
<br />
Now, you may wonder what kind of anime dedicates itself for a romance between a guy and multiple girls. After all, infidelity can be a sensitive topic and spark some controversy. In this show, Naoya plants the idea that he can date two girls at the same time. In this case, they are Saki and Nagisa. After certain circumstances, he decided to be their boyfriend. With his brutal honesty, he tries to be assertive about his intentions but of course, this often sets off red flags and ends up embarassing everyone involved. Watching Naoya&#039;s behavior in this show feels like a romance sit-com. With every episode, we see how much Naoya wants to please his girlfriends. Whenever he comes up with an insane logic, we know that Naoya is truthful about his intentions. He&#039;s a lover.<br />
<br />
Yes, it&#039;s a harem. There&#039;s going to be drama and endless amount of misunderstandings, romance tropes, and story segments that is aimed to adhere to male fantasies. Like most harems, the show has character rivalries although in this anime, Saki and Nagisa&#039;s is much lighthearted and friendly. That&#039;s a different story when we meet Rika, a girl who goes to extreme lengths to be close to Naoya. With an ego as high as Mount Everest, her tsundere personality follows her wherever she goes. Unfortunately, this also brings her trouble and drama into Naoya&#039;s life with his girlfriends. At the peak of the show, we see just how far Rika goes to get Naoya&#039;s attention and resorting to any means necessary. However, I don&#039;t want to downplay the Saki and Nagisa either. Both girls may not be as forceful as Rika but they have their own personal feelings. In fact, you could say that Saki herself is a massive pervert and almost mirrors some of Naoya&#039;s fantasies. Meanwhile, Nagisa grows out of her shell and puts on daring outfits to please Noaya. From this viewpoint, it&#039;s clear the show wants to appeal to all the main cast as much as possible without leaving anyone behind. Well, then there&#039;s Shino.<br />
<br />
Compared to the other girls, Shino is much more serious and follows a set of morals. And in her mind, Naoya&#039;s lecherous deeds and intentions are immoral. She represents the anti-thesis of the main girls. In essence, she objects the very idea of Naoya being involved in multiple relationships. However, this season only vaguely explore her character as much of the screentime is dedicated to Saki, Nagisa, and Rika. Her presence is overshadowed for the majority of the show although when she does appear, Shino has an alluring presence. Bear in mind that the anime adaptation is based off of an ongoing manga and her arc takes place in later chapters. It&#039;s one of the drawbacks of adapting this show so early on. Yet, it&#039;s clear the anime wants us to see how all the main girls behave with Naoya.<br />
<br />
Artistically, harem anime often lacks visual quality except for showcasing fan service at every chance it gets. The same can be applied in some cases for this show. After all, we do get a load of fan service ranging from onsen episodes to the classy stuck in the gym together segments. However, it&#039;s clear from day one that the directors wanted to draw an appeal to the female cast. Every female character is characterized with alluring tones whether it&#039;s their curvy bodies or well-endowed boobs. Let me just say that while the anime doesn&#039;t fully rely on that to sell itself, it&#039;s clear they wanted the girls to look sexy. Saki is the guiltest example as she even goes as far to use her body to get Naoya&#039;s attention in bed in one episode. At the same time, the anime stylishly decorates its theme song with social media visuals. It&#039;s contagiously catchy and fits with the modern norm. Finally, let&#039;s not forget about the overexaggerated character reactions of the cast. Saki and Naoya carries this show when you see how much they react in the most insane way possible in a harem anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not an expert or professor on harem anime. Watching Kanojo no Kanojo is about as simple as it gets with a guy getting involved with multiple girls. It&#039;s a show that flirts endlessly with itself and every episode builds more and more into its premise. Can we just say that no matter who you root for, Naoya is pretty much the biggest winner? No matter what impresses or displease you about the show, you have to admit that Kanojo no Kanojo does justice for a harem.

    &quot;BuT tHiS AnIme iS SuPpOsEd tO bE StUpiD&quot; you know what else is supposed to be stupid? The creator&#039;s other work, &quot;Aho Girl&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unlike aho girl where the mc has a functional brain, everyone appears to be braindead in this anime. Yes, including the mc.<br />
<br />
Maybe it&#039;s because the heroine in aho girl will somewhat suffer from the consequences of her own stupidity, but the plot of Kanojo mo Kanojo is just incomprehensible and all the characters appear to be your average happy-go-lucky harem anime characters.<br />
<br />
&quot;yOu cAn&#039;T jUsT cOmpArE 2 DifFerEnt AnImE jUst BeCauSe ThEy ShArE ThE SaME CrEaToR&quot; yes I can. In fact, I already did.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411001">
        Aho Girl is stupid and is also somewhat a harem though the plot doesn&#039;t really focus on the other girls. But hey atleast it&#039;s actually funny and not just your average unfunny &quot;comedy&quot; anime.<br />
<br />
Oh, he has 2 girlfriends? Okay... Oh the girls are living with him now? What next? His girlfriends double in numbers? Bing Bong I&#039;m not wrong. Haha guess what? The girfriends also vary in boob size. Haha totally unexpectable. We have the flat tsundere, the big boob mature girl and also the humongous badonkers annoying girl which is the latest addition in the girlfriend collection so far. <br />
<br />
Story and characters 3/10<br />
Art is 7/10 but good art ≠ good story
