    Himegoto is an enlightening piece of modern masterpiece that provides insight into the biases of society.<br />
<br />
Episode 12 has undoubtedly a few of the most emotional scenes in animation history. The poignancy is unparalleled by any other. Me and a few homies cried for hours before resuming masturbation. No wonder battle-hardened Himegoto fans sneer at the childish themes of &quot;Your Name&quot;.<br />
<br />
All the way up to the final episode, the student council has been intentionally depicted as an oppressive and corrupt force that exercises their dominance through power and wealth. The characters embody TV (especially anime) cliches that seemingly deem the show as &quot;tasteless&quot;. Yet brainless normies

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295940">
        are unable to fathom the intricacies of bland characterization, which absolute draw attention to the ingenious plot line.<br />
<br />
While I am not a hardcore feminist, I am still admire the efforts put in by the creators outline the polarity of control that exists between genders. It saddens me that no one else experiences that sharp melancholy. Dongers out for Hime, boys.<br />
<br />
The story constantly repeats situations where the gender roles are reversed. However repulsed audiences may be, one cannot judge art through a narrow and confined perspective. If an alien species is observing Earth from afar, they would deem this as the peak of human evolution. <br />
<br />
On the outside, Himegoto seems like a show full of fan service, appealing only to fans of trap characters. Yet upon closer investigation, many would find a carefully-crafted critique of authoritarian regimes and gender norms.<br />
<br />
Moments such as Episode 12&#039;s (again, one of the greatest) molester sequence will go down as animation&#039;s most romantic scenes.<br />
<br />

    If you read my other review before, well nothing much changed, I say pretty much the same stuff, I still feel for how it is, and I still have my similar opinion.<br />
Anyways....<br />
<br />
Himegoto, is a gender-bender anime that came out in the Summer 2014, and was one of the &#039;shorts&#039; anime where it&#039;s like a few minutes or so. While watching this anime I couldn&#039;t really say I really liked it or enjoyed it a lot, even though I really really like the gender-bender genre. Seeing other animes like Ouran Host Club, Ranma 1/2 (didn&#039;t finish), and other ones like that one filler episode of Little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review155473">
        Busters! was great to watch, but not really Himegoto.<br />
<br />
The story is about a boy named Hime Arikawa who is forced to join the Student Council and to cross-dress. As he joins he is basically the dog for it, or shall we call, the b*tch for the student council. I mean like basically he was for the entire series, because our guy is pretty submissive. Hime just falls into the student council&#039;s hands and they do WHATEVER THEY WANT. MHMM...anyways...<br />
<br />
When it comes to the art, I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty normal...nothing great or bad, it&#039;s okay I&#039;d say. Like they do make characters cute at those times etc. As for the sound, I actually like the OP and ED, it&#039;s not amazing, but it&#039;s okay to good. <br />
<br />
And as Anime is weird as it is, we all accept how it is.<br />
For me, there&#039;s few minor problems towards to show, some in my opinion I did not like and some was okay. Fan-service may be a huge turn off to the audience as most of the fan-service is more towards Hime, who is a guy, and well, you&#039;ll see some bulges and undie-shots.....(the feeling where this may be loli, but it&#039;s like OH WAIT, IT&#039;S A GUY, SO IT&#039;S TOTALLY FINE)<br />
Also, some people may like submissive character, I&#039;m honestly not the biggest fan, but it&#039;s okay....<br />
Weirdest thing I&#039;d say from the show is how both genders fine him really attractive. Like to the point, GUY WOULD RAPE HIM...LIKE, THEY LIKE, I DON&#039;T CARE, IT&#039;S GOING TO BE DAIJOUBOU, HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE.....<br />
._.<br />
<br />
Entertainment wise though, I actually enjoyed many parts rather than getting creeped out. There are many parts that are funny because of the gender bender, which was something I was looking for.  :D Also, may be considered spoiler, how you see it....I also liked the unexpected gender benders tho&#039;! xD<br />
<br />
Well, I give this anime a 5.5, because nothing much stood out to me, but entertainment was okay-good. If you like the review you can press it was helpful, if you didn&#039;t like it or didn&#039;t agree you can press it wasn&#039;t helpful, but if it wasn&#039;t helpful, doo tell me why, I&#039;d like to try to get better at reviewing ^_^ <br />

    Yahoo! I get the first review... Of this... Anime... Suddenly I feel way less excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;My skin melted, my powers disappeared and suddenly I was nothing but a shadow, weaker than the most humble of ghosts.&quot;<br />
<br />
To get the technical staff out of the way, the anime is a three minute short with lively animation, funny music exploring completely sexual themes. You could say it&#039;s Nekoyama&#039;s deranged psychotic sister... Or maybe brother. At this point I can&#039;t tell.<br />
<br />
Well to begin with, we see an insanely cute girl assaulted by 2 Yakuza members, trying to make her pay off the debt her parents had left behind by selling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154765">
        her body. One even wants to do her on the spot. Pretty ordinary staff for Japan&#039;s standards. Until the other Yakuza guy says &quot;Dude, you know that&#039;s a guy right?!&quot; <br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Well, the anime already crushed one of my dreams, that sure didn&#039;t take long. As you have it our protagonist is a high-school trap. He is also disturbingly familiar with crossdressing and being sexually harassed. <br />
<br />
But suddenly the student council of his school arrives to save the day! Consisting of three girls whose names&amp;stereotypes you won&#039;t bother remembering they beat the Yakuza members (again, pretty typical staff for Japan) and rescue the protagonist in order to recruit her as the council&#039;s mascot and to have something to harass (oh yeah, all 3 are major perverts). They discover the trap but decide to recruit the protagonist nonetheless, making it (I refuse to call that thing a &quot;he&quot;) act as the council&#039;s dog, in exchange for paying off its debt. Obviously part of the job is practically fanservicing everyone in school and leaving the &quot;best-of&quot; for the student council. They also make it announce in front of everyone that its gender is male (highly questionable).<br />
<br />
So let me make things clear: We have 3 horny high school girls that were looking for yuri harassment, fell for a trap, and then entered an S&amp;M exhibitionist relationship with said trap. <br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Do you realise on how many levels of f£%$ed up we are here?<br />
<br />
The second episode, introducing the rest of the notable cast actually made my soul sink even deeper into despair than the first had.The tired protagonist goes back home where he&#039;s greeted by his cute immouto (younger sister) wearing only her bath towel and rubbing herself on him to comfort him. Well, perhaps things aren&#039;t as bad as they looked in the sta it&#039;s a trap, isn&#039;t it?<br />
Apparently crossdressing and looking more feminine than the females is in the family&#039;s genes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as the protagonist finds more and more ways to get sexually assaulted by everyone regardless of gender, his little sis... Brother, meets someone who has sworn to replace the current student council and therefore save the protagonist from constant humiliation. The head of the public morals commity... A LOLI! Oh, the most wonderful of sights to behold in an anime where the protagonist is a trap. Whoever has read my previous reviews or knows me irl knows that I have a certain weakness to lolis (as in,  I absolutely adore them). And she is exactly as all lolis should be. Slightly tsundere, incredibly cutely shy, absolutely, 180 degrees, washboard-level, completely wallish, flat, with an adorable mini skirt, with the cute striped panties that hide a tiny bu...<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
SON OF A BITCH!! It wasn&#039;t enough was it? You just had to ruin the loli too!<br />
<br />
The rest of the episodes are filled with chances for the protagonist to give fanservice to various people, with the ending of the most recent one (ep 4) being truly disturbing.<br />
<br />
If you liked Boku no Pico or enjoy watching messed up things try it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a continuation of the review above, 11 episodes have been released by now. I had thought that the series couldn&#039;t get anymore disturbing. Boy was I wrong...<br />
<br />
At the end of each episode that passes the viewer will experience... Revelations to the protagonist that he rather enjoys being treated as a female. You could practically say that with the ending of each episode its gender changes more from &quot;undefinable&quot; to &quot;female&quot;. And I won&#039;t lie, that&#039;s disturbing as f&quot;$%. Also disturbing as f£%^ is how it was revealed that the maid of the public morals committee, a busty blonde (maid: my second fetish, ranked right after loliconnesss)... Is a dude with an overstuffed bra... Yes, there was actually another trap... Mere words cannot begin to describe the psychological trauma of having BOTH my dreams crushed so mercilessly. Oh and the protagonist&#039;s sister&#039;s (...) friend which appeared to be a boy always hiding his face? It&#039;s a girl crossdressing as a boy.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
 One can only raise his hands to the heavens and scream to whatever twisted god allowed the creation of this abomination... &quot;WHAT THE F£%K?&quot;<br />
<br />
After watching episode 12: 1)Men who are men are rapists, that&#039;s today&#039;s lesson. 2)Women who are women are cruel inconsiderate jerks. 3)Men who are women are the only pure people in this world (...yes I find it as rediculous as you do). 4)If you quit the student council WHY ARE YOU STILL CROSSDRESSING?!

    This anime is a catastrophic attempt at humor, and a callous one with rose tinted glasses towards what is veritably a whole slew of sex crimes. Yes, he is apparently a male who does initially to consent to crossdressing to pay off a debt, though it seems the student council gets off to putting him into embarrassing situations, knowing full well the consequences that will entail, which is usually at least a panty shot, if not worst, without his knowledge beforehand or his consent. <br />
<br />
For all the episodes I watched, I kept thinking &quot;Where is the punchline?&quot; Then I realize that the situations are the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244295">
        punchline, and I shook my head and realize that is a bottom of a barrel title that indulges in the same tier of cruelty as Watamote without the deep introspection and characterization of someone like Tomoko. It is just a gag anime who thinks the idea of a man, or a cross dressing man, being harassed and shamed, is a novel idea in itself, and one likely to garner laughs. <br />
<br />
Well woop-de-doo, look at how many people think this is a decent anime, or even a progressive one. Ha, seriously? This anime does nothing other than show the student council doing things to Hime that go far beyond reasonable work contracts, even for someone is paid to crossdress (Especially so), and his consent or lack thereof, made obvious by his expressions and pleads episode after episode. The student council are responsible for creating situations that would allow such public displays of embarrassment in the first place, with morally unreasonable and insidious actions that were intended to do so. There is no punchline. I am suppose to find all this funny in nature, like the slapstick of The Three Stooges. No, it is cruel and a backwards trivialization of men or cross dressers in general concerning sexual consent.<br />
<br />
I am not opposed to the idea of humor surrounding a serious topic of sexual assaults, but all this anime amounts to is a mix of cringe comedy and sadism. No meta commentary, nothing but the situation itself. It slaps on happy music while Hime is in fact, sexually harassed, assaulted, and at least one point, nearly raped.<br />
<br />
Point being that because he is a cross dresser, because he is a man, that I am suppose to take this humorously. Seriously? Can we stop laughing about poop jokes and realize that this problem concerning these demographics, male or crossdresser, are very real, and should be taken with some serious caution?<br />
<br />
I mean, if the genders were reversed, would anyone praise it?<br />
<br />
If there is anything to praise about the anime, it is the last few episodes, beginning with Hime nearly getting raped, something that the show acknowledges for what it is, for once, while the student council sits by and does nothing, whereas Hime gives them a satisfying &quot;reason you suck speech&quot;. <br />
<br />
This is the only reasonable part, because it actually paints the student council as vicious voyeurs and Hime as someone who demands respect. Though it is not 2 episodes later that Hime forgives them, and all is happy.<br />
<br />
Wait, what? You acknowledges that 18-san and friends were willing to let Hime get raped just so they can film it, yet he forgives them? Freaking forgives them? What the hell?<br />
<br />
I am sorry, I need a break. Honestly, if you like this anime, I am not sure I can respect that opinion, but to paint it as a mark of progression for such people is not only to stymie progress, but to contribute to the issue&#039;s regression.

    Am i gay?<br />
No<br />
Did i enjoy the fan service in this anime?<br />
Maybe <br />
<br />
Himegoto is a anime about a cross dressing boy who is in debt. The anime itself was very enjoyable, i had a few chuckles. But the main thing this anime had was fan service. Lots and lots of fan service. This anime may have turned me a little gay. The story was fine, the animation was fine. The anime was fine. It didn&#039;t really impact me (except now traps are appealing to me). Its also very short, so you can smash this out in one night. That is all i have to say about

    For an anime with 4 minute episodes, it is safe to assume that reading reviews for Himegoto will not result in anything much being ruined except maybe the punchline of a few jokes. <br />
<br />
Himegoto is currently airing, but at episode 11 I can confidently say I have a feel for the series. Our main character Arikawa Hime is chased by debt collectors and is about to be sold off into the sex industry, before the rest of the main cast come to his rescue. These 3 are part of the student council, and are hugely rich. They decide to pay his way out of debt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161125">
        (from the kindness of their heart) and take him in as the school council&#039;s dog. <br />
<br />
This is about as far as the plot goes so far. The rest of the series is basically the day-to-day life of a school full of crossdressers and/or perverts. It&#039;s by no means realistic, so if you want an idea of life in Japanese schooling please do not watch this anime! It is however a fun and interesting look at life in a school that is run by a team of perverted high schoolers.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are very well established considering there are only 4 minute episodes. Each one is visually very unique, and their personalities are all individual. The wants and aspirations of each character is consistent and their speaking patterns are also consistent.<br />
<br />
The art style is simple and pleasant, with interesting and varied backdrops which do not swallow the characters with their colouring or line work. The characters themselves are animated very well, with a lot of movement and the effects of physics being displayed in simple ways like uniform creases or hair bounce. It is wonderfully composed and a delight to look at.<br />
<br />
The humor itself could be described as shock humor I suppose, with the random spontaneous nature of scenes and punch lines that smack you in the face by coming far out of left field, but it is genuinely amusing to watch. It is packed full of interesting characters that work well together in comedic situations. It will make you laugh, but can not be equated to humor like Nichijou which is much more intentional and feels very different.<br />
<br />
It is not hentai, but does have a lot of trap exposure in the chest area. Technically SFW, but a lot of scenes would not impress your boss if he was looking over your shoulder on your average work day. This show is definitely for older audiences, at least 18 for most countries. That being said, it has not yet got any on-screen sex scenes, nor does it have many intense sexual harassment being shown. It is sometimes implied, however, or even threatened by characters to one another. <br />
<br />
The sort of audience this anime would most likely appeal to are those who have few boundaries, and no problems with &quot;trap&quot; characters being put into awkward situations or appearing in scenes with heavy sexual overtones. There are a lot of people who will refuse to watch Himegoto as it can appear to cross many boundaries, especially in the Western World. However, if all you want from an anime is an enjoyable, even sexy short show to watch inbetween study sessions or anime marathons, Himegoto is the anime for you.<br />
It has already been subtitled by many groups, and I highly recommend supporting the official release when it finishes airing.<br />
<br />

    Every dude in this show is a girl, every girl is a dude. The whole show is a trap, this curious predicament really makes a man wonder, are traps really gay? is it really so wrong to be attracted to a drawing of a girl that happens to have a bulge between its legs where in reality there should be none? these are questions a man must ask himself, as he watches a show such as Himegoto. Sir William Smith once said &quot;It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book of the work contained a general

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256539">
        account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things.&quot; this perfectly arranged bundle of words with no meaning, perfectly encapsulates my feelings toward the show, a bundle of things thrown together for laughs, with no real meaning towards them. There is nothing original here, and yet i cannot look away, like a trainwreck is persists my mind and penis, as i sit here confused wondering whether its really ok for me to fap to this or not. According to legend,  Pythagoras&#039; followers threw the man who discovered irrational numbers off the boat, as it really made no sense in their day and age. Similarily, i want to throw myself off a boat, for taking so much time out of my free time to write this, when really it doesn&#039;t matter in the slightest. I did ironically enjoy it though, no not the boat thing, i cant swim. I meant the show, irony is the spice of life they say, now you may be wondering who out there actually says this, well i do, silly face, and therefore everyone else will as well, because my word is law. Ironically i dont actually believe any of what i just wrote and neither should you. Watch the show for all i care, but if a member of the student counsil tries to dress YOU in girly clothes against your will, you say no, and get the heck out of there, cause that is No Good.<br />

    Story:<br />
The only thing more disgusting than this animation is that there&#039;s someone who actually created this. It&#039;s horrendous in every sense, completely implausible and unrelatable to anyone, and exploitive material for the most depraved minds. I hated the fact that I went into this blind, and I also am having complete second guesses about my personal rule that &quot;I must finish what I start.&quot;<br />
<br />
The &#039;story&#039; doesn&#039;t have any other purpose than to excite the viewer in the most disgusting of ways, and it doesn&#039;t matter that they replaced a female with a male for the majority of these &#039;action shots.&#039; This sort of exploitive material

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223576">
        is disgusting regardless of who is at the helm. It&#039;s 100% gender neutral, at this point. I feel terribly sorry for the animation team that would rather create something worthwhile and the musician who had to create an OST for a work with no inherent value.<br />
<br />
My critique on the story is so tangential because there is no story, and nothing matters at all. The end of this work is a punch in the face with existentialism and I cannot recommend it to anyone. You don&#039;t even have to read the rest of this review. Just avoid this anime like the plague.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The animation is fairly good, and I appreciate the fact that, despite it being a 3-minute per episode production, backgrounds were somewhat varied, even if it was a boring school setting just like every other work out there.<br />
<br />
Nothing felt disproportionate, and while we get some ridiculous phallic physics, everything else seems to move rather naturally. Also, characters look unique and expressions are, while abused like the plague, somewhat varied.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
One of the voice actors sounded like their voice was thrown through a modulator. However, I think that was me just perceiving it wrong. Everyone else was fairly good.<br />
<br />
OST was hackneyed but, I mean, it works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Nobody is realistic, everyone follows tropes. In other words, nothing original and nothing interesting. You won&#039;t get anything special out of these guys. Their types are boring and predictable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />

    Himegoto is an outstanding anime showcasing the erotic nature of traps. I was full mast the entire time while watching. All twelve of the 4 minute long episodes managed to make me feel berry up inside. Upon the ashes of my former self I lay my crown. I have forsaken my lust for material possessions and my need for sexual gratification. I no longer am satisfied with women. I only feel something for anime traps. Himegoto is eternal and shall not be forgotten by time or space. I shall forget myself in anime traps and transcend my human flaws. I won&#039;t judge those who don&#039;t,

    As, I&#039;ve finish watching this omake............I&#039;m guessing that what animes were called that only runs for a maximum of 4 mins, ok, I just gonna get straight to the point, so here are my ratings for this omake:<br />
<br />
Warning, contains slight spoilers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Good 7:<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: Himegoto or Secret Princess is a gender bender and the first one I&#039;ve watched, I&#039;d probably say that it was quite unique, when the story plot focuses on a girly boy who was left with a mountain of debt by his no good parents and has to be the student councils&#039;s dog since they&#039;re the ones who had settled it, now it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163297">
        maybe a kinda of Cinderella thingy, except in this case the guy went from the frying pan to the fire kinda of a problem That he has to dress as a girl, that to me was something that I find funny.<br />
<br />
Overall: Well, such uniqueness did delivered this anime well, since at first I may have been annoyed by the Guy&#039;s pussyness and yet got lodes of laugh as get&#039;s himself to a lot of awkward situation that his masters (Student council members) put on him, but, for this anime to be called &quot;Himegoto&quot; or Secret Princess doesn&#039;t really jive with this omake, and if I were the original creator, Norio Tsukudani, I&#039;d probably title it &quot; Okama  de Sentokai&quot; or the cross-dresser in the student council.<br />
<br />
<br />
Poor 3. <br />
<br />
Art: Ok, so I kinda like that Hime Arikawa is a crossdresser and so as most of the public morals as cute, but I also want to see Hime wearing a boy&#039;s uniform, fortunately it never happen, in fact he should be wearing a boy&#039;s school uniform in episode 12, let&#039;s not for get that he quit the student council in that episode, for that I hereby declared this anime&#039;s art as poor, co&#039;z I&#039;m disappointed to not see his manly side.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very Good 8.<br />
<br />
Sound: I like the seiyuu who did Hime, 18kin, Unko and Kaguya&#039;s voice, what I really love was the opening song, so the score is for the opening song.<br />
<br />
Decent 4.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Hime Arikawa, may seemly be annoying for being a pussy, frankly there were time that I would like to hit him on the head, but it was his girly side that has balanced out my annoyance for him, so it was one of the raeson why the character category deserve a 4.<br />
<br />
Now for the student council like 18kin, Unko and Albertina II, they my biggest annoyance which is one reason why I can&#039;t give this character category a high score. Basically them putting Hime in such appalling situation was pretty much unbecoming of a student council, also for the two members of the student council to be 18, I guess I can&#039;t never understnd why this anime director  Yūji Yanase have to portray them as 18 years of age, I don&#039;t about you, but shouldn&#039;t high-school student of that age be gradates already? I&#039;m thinking that anime director  Yūji Yanase may have been a repeat student. Eh whatever, even so, them student council did add up to the comedy genre of this omake, which is another reason why this category should be &quot;Decent &quot; enough.<br />
<br />
Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : Thought, I may have given this omake&#039;s overall a &quot;Good&quot; score, it wasn&#039;t really that enjoyable since there were situations that irritates me to see Hime to be this dumb and a pussy, though  the anime was funny, my reaction to it is mixed between this omake&#039;s comedy and my disappointment for Hime, but seeing him having his first kiss with 18kin that probably was one moment that I should give this category a fair and that the way I enjoy this omake, so should I say more? <br />

    The premise of Himegoto is that of a porn. Our protagonist, Arikawa Hime, is a male high school student with very feminine looks. His parents who are always traveling abroad left behind huge debts and he is being chased by debt collectors. The debt collectors attempt to rape him but he is saved by the student council, which is made up of three sadistic girls. He is then forced to become their pet dog and wear girls’ clothes for his entire school year. From then on it’s just all sexual abuse, sexual harassment and humiliation for poor boy Hime. <br />
<br />
<br />
--- “Sexual abuse is wholesome 100!!!”<br />
<br />
In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401518">
        every episode Hime is forced to do humiliating things, like cheer-leading, cosplay, wearing skimpy clothing, and even nude modeling. Even if it is stated that he was already into cross-dressing before that, it doesn’t justify him being constantly humiliated and abused. Everybody around him, boys and girls, are constantly sexually abusing him, including his brother and his “friend”. People are constantly lifting his skirt, groping him, touching his d*ck and his nipples. Boys attempt to rape him at several occasions. What’s worse is that all of it is portrayed as cute and funny, when what he is going through should be enough to drive him to suicide! <br />
<br />
<br />
--- Rape = comedy<br />
<br />
The situations where the protagonist is sexually abused by everybody around him are apparently supposed to be the “comedy” of this anime. There’s absolutely nothing else. In other terms, the comedy is non-existent.<br />
<br />
<br />
--- Rape, but inclusive<br />
<br />
There’s nothing wrong with cross-dressing and femboys. The problem is that it is through being forced to wear skimpy clothing in front of horny males attempting to rape him that Hime accepts that he wants to wear feminine clothes and a wig. In this anime, sexual abuse is a way to “awaken your true self” and accept your feminine side. How progressive! <br />
<br />
<br />
--- And everything is forgiven at the end!<br />
<br />
Yep. Towards the end of the anime (ep.12 and 13), two boys attempt to rape him, but the student council just stands there and watches until he is saved by some other group. The three girls of the student council are scolded and then everything is forgiven. Yes, all of the sexual abuse and humiliation he went through. “Isn’t it great you made up with them?”, says one character. Yeah right! Isn’t it great he made up with his former abusers? “Thank you”, Hime says to the student council. Yeah thank them for abusing and humiliating you all this time, you absolute fucking buffoon! <br />
<br />
<br />
--- The production value is decent<br />
<br />
Since it’s adapted from a 4-koma manga and the episodes are very short, the animation doesn’t have to be of high quality. The background music is forgettable and generic. Same for the opening and ending, they’re the generic shit that you should skip. They’re also surprisingly cheerful for a show about sexual abuse. But it is decent enough for this type of show. Most of the character designs are well done. They fulfill their purpose of looking cute, most particularly for Hime. The voice-acting is also decent, I believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
--- Verdict <br />
<br />
Is there really anything else to say? This show belongs to the trash can. Even if it is only 40 minutes long it isn’t worth your time.

    A while ago I wrote a review for the series &quot;Shishunki Bitter Change&quot; which acted as a deconstruction of what would happen if two people had their genders unintentionally changed by playing the premise realistically, exploring the psychological ramifications of living in someone&#039;s else&#039;s body that is not your own and in a completely different gender. It was a good series overall, though some may wonder what this has to do with Himegoto. <br />
<br />
In Taoism, there is a symbol known as the &quot;Taijitu.&quot; More well-known as the Ying-Yang, it is a symbol of duality. Everything has an opposite which compliments each other. For war, there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231270">
        is peace. For sadness, there is happiness. For every Shishunki Bitter Change, there is Himegoto, a show that is quite awful and very, very creepy. <br />
<br />
The plot premise is simple. His parents had a lot of debt and being the assholes they are, they left the debt on the main character Hime Arikawa. Pursued by loan sharks, he&#039;s bailed out by the head of the Student Council. Because somehow the Yakuza pales in comparison to a bunch of high school students, am I right? They are also inexplicably able to pay off the debt, but in exchange for Hime becoming their cosmic plaything by passing off as a girl. And thus begins an exercise in masochism as he is forced into many questionable situations. <br />
<br />
Traps as they are called are often played up for comedic purposes. Understandable however. After all, comedy is awkward. Finding out that a beautiful girl is actually male can also be awkward with little prior warning as well, and as such it is a natural fit. Comedy is what Himegoto tries, but it instead aims for masochism and downright abuse by the hands of the Student Council as they force Hime into incredibly exploitative situations in which he&#039;s downright abused, objectified, and near-rape scenes. Instead of his predicament being played for drama, it is instead played up for comedic purposes. If you&#039;re 21, here is a fun (if you like being drunk that is) drinking game: Take a shot every time you see a panty shot of Hime. You won&#039;t survive. And he&#039;s not exactly being consenting with this either. That&#039;s probably one of the big issues I do have with this whole ordeal. <br />
<br />
In High School DxD (a harem infamous for copious fanservice) the main character Issei literally wants a harem, and is incredibly perverted. However, he&#039;s not exploitive. Rias allows Issei to copiously grope her with her consent, and the same goes for most of the girls in his harem. It wasn&#039;t an issue since both parties were fairly comfortable and on board with whatever zany antics Issei wanted to indulge himself in. In Himegoto however, he has no desire to crossdress. Kinda. He&#039;s initially on board with him crossdressing so that he can pay off his debt. It goes further when he&#039;s also forced into embarassing situations that he is very clearly uncomfortable with, and as such the audience is uncomfortable when the show goes like &quot;Hey, you want to see another panty shot of this guy? No? Too bad! Even if he doesn&#039;t like it, he&#039;s still cute right?&quot; <br />
<br />
I think it would have been interesting if they took the premise seriously. How would the life of a Japanese male teen look like if he continually went to school crossdressing? How would that affect his social life? His relationships? His psychological state? These questions aren&#039;t really explored here. I know that the premise is different, but these are still topics that could have been explored. Though even if it would have been explored, it probably wouldn&#039;t have mattered considering how everyone else is either a girl, or a guy who crossdresses as a girl. <br />
<br />
Sigh. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a very cheap series overall. Little substance to it, very creepy and exploitative. Sexual harassment like this is passed off as something arousing. I can&#039;t really get the appeal of this show when the cute guy who looks like a girl is treated horribly. I&#039;m not a masochist either. And I doubt even masochists will like this. <br />

    If you are actually reading reviews for this show from some reason let me some it up for you.<br />

If you like traps then watch it, if you don&#039;t then don&#039;t.<br />

Yes the show is stupid but you&#039;re allowed to like dumb stuff, the show is like less than an hour long so it&#039;s hardly any time commitment to watch, the show knows what it is and doesn&#039;t try to be anything else. Character design is cute, lots of upskirt shots, and there is plenty of traps to go around all within an easy to digest amount of time. There isn&#039;t much else to say it&#039;s a

    Oh boy. I....I don&#039;t even...I don&#039;t even know where to begin with this crap. I don&#039;t. I really don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Well got to try I guess. Hellos people I am Josh and today I am reviewing the gender-bender anime Himegoto....Yeah.<br />
<br />
Story- The story is about a guy who cross dresses who is in debt thanks to his parents. He gets saved by three middle school council members and basically becomes there bitch in exchange for them paying his huge debt.<br />
<br />
.............*Takes sip of water*<br />
<br />
....What? You thought there more? You thought I go more into detail? Well I hate to break it to you but that is really the only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224042">
        story in this. The dude has to dress like a girl and become there bitch and do what they say. If you want me say more I guess I can say they are rivaled by some other council full of crossdressers. That&#039;s...That is all I got people.<br />
<br />
Art- The art is pretty good especially for something this short. It&#039;s nice to look at minus the fan services shots, but these shots would be disturbing and uncomfortable no matter what, female or male but it is definetly something I want to un-see <br />
<br />
Sound- The sound is alright. Nothing particular horrible but nothing amazing or that good to be honest.<br />
<br />
Characters- Yeah I&#039;ll cut straight to the point on this one, the characters are forgettable as hell. Basically common tropes you have seen in likely a dozen anime. A majority of the main ones are crossdressers include the MC&#039;s little brother. Hell the show highlighted them as traps. Really that not me saying that the anime flat out said it. Then there are like 2 other cross dressers, one dressed as a maid and some chick dressed as a dude. Then you got the 3 council member girls who are about as perverted as you can getting excitement out of his dude crossdressing and him being there bitch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- I mean I seen worse. It isn&#039;t the worst thing I seen. I was more or less bored then I was creeped out watching this but it was still bad to watch from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
Overall- I would mostly recommend this series for those that are fans of crossdressing and gender bender stuff I guess. That is obviously the target demographic so if your like me and don&#039;t like this stuff, you might not enjoy this at all<br />
<br />
With that being said, peace people

If there were to be a second season I would like them to cover Huffman trees as it is something that I am looking forward to going over in my discrete math classes.

    (For starters, don&#039;t ask why I watched this cause honestly, I cannot give you an answer in any way shape or form.)  In every anime season, there&#039;s always going to be shows that are grouped up together in terms of expectancy.  There will always be the shows that EVERYONE is hyped for, there will also be the shows that may not be as hyped but, still have some sort of audience to watch it, and then there&#039;s that entry that just makes you say...WTF?  And for the summer season, it was Himegoto, or Secret Princess Hime.  Let&#039;s begin.<br />
<br />
Story (6.06/10):  To

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163921">
        be completely honest, there is no story to this.  Since this is an anime that consists of four minute shorts, there&#039;s not really very much material that will be covered, and therefore not very much actual story that you&#039;ll have.  The basic &quot;premise&quot; basically revolves around the life of a boy named &quot;Hime&quot; (No, not kidding, his name actually is Princess) who gets some random debt payed by members of the student council.  And so, as repayment for saying him from creepy debt collectors, Hime is forced to become part of the student council and cross-dress.  <br />
<br />
The basic premise of the show really is just putting our main &quot;heroine&quot; Hime into random situations that would seem funny due to the fact that our main character is a boy being forced to be dressed up as a girl or do all sorts of &quot;girl&quot; things like buying female undergarments or cheerleading.  Beyond that, there&#039;s nothing that you&#039;ll REALLY get out of this, as there is no character development, no story progression, and mostly just a bunch of &quot;my penis is confused&quot; moments.  <br />
<br />
Now, I have to congratulate this show on just how shameless it is in showing what it&#039;s about.  It&#039;s a gender bender that KNOWS it&#039;s a gender bender and doesn&#039;t hide the fact in any way, shape or form.  Does this mean it&#039;s a good show?  Well, it&#039;s entertaining for sure, but I wouldn&#039;t consider it beyond just something to waste an hour on.  (Since you can actually finish the series in about an hour, although personally, not recommended.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Very confident in telling what the show is<br />
-  Nothing that a real anime would have (it&#039;s a short, so don&#039;t expect much.)<br />
<br />
Characters (6.46/10): As for characters, well, you don&#039;t really get much information out of them.  Aside from Hime, who is the main victim of the show, being forced to cross dress on a daily basis, we have the three student council girls Unko, Albertina, and 18+ (I am not kidding.  18+ is actually the girl&#039;s name).  And beyond them we have the stereotypical &quot;student Disciplinary committee&quot; which consists of Hime&#039;s brother, someone named #1 (seriously, who named these characters?) a maid, and the president of the committee.  None of these characters really get any development and are the way they are presented for the whole of the show.  It&#039;s not bad by any means, but it doesn&#039;t make them completely memorable.<br />
<br />
There is however a &quot;quirk&quot; of sorts that makes this show reiterate the phrase &quot;My penis is confused&quot;.  Every character you see except for the three student council girls Albertina, Unko, and 18+, is cross-dressing.  (Let that sink in.)  Literally, every other character is.  Now, while the character personalities themselves didn&#039;t make this short memorable, this certain quality did in some sense.  (Maybe not in the best sense.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/-  &quot;Interesting&quot; trait to put on most characters<br />
-  Forgettable character personalities<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (6.33/10 and 6.34/10):  For art, well, the show just looks average.  There&#039;s nothing really noteworthy that stands out to me in terms of &quot;this looks amazing&quot; and overall, it doesn&#039;t really have much of a complicated animation.  It&#039;s really more of a comedy anime style animation and it does fit the show.  <br />
<br />
However, the art does sport a little...oddity within it.  You know the normal panty shots that you see in a normal ecchi anime?  Yeah, now think that with boys.  (Sorry for the mental scarring, but this is what this show does.)<br />
<br />
And for music, the tracks for the show are nothing special.  They&#039;re generic and actually somewhat catchy, but they&#039;re not tracks I consider to be out of this world and worth a listen to beyond the taste you are given in the anime.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/-  Decent art<br />
+/-  Average music<br />
-  Scarring ecchi moments<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (6.21/10):  To be honest, I don&#039;t even know what I was thinking when I put this on my list.  I guess I thought to myself, hey, this shouldn&#039;t be so bad, right?  Well, in a sense, I was right.  Himegoto is shameless to present itself as what it is, a show about a cross-dressing male.  It doesn&#039;t shy away from that idea which I actually find quite commendable.  However, as a side effect of that, it leads to some very...uncomfortable moments as the positive of the show showing what it actually is no holds barred, is a double-edged sword.  <br />
<br />
Did I like this show?<br />
<br />
To be honest, kinda.  Don&#039;t get me wrong here, I would NEVER watch this show again, but for a four minute run-time, it did give me a lot to think about and never have a facepalmed so much at my life decisions, ever.  <br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this show?<br />
<br />
Honestly, there really isn&#039;t any actual complaints about this show that I have.  For a short, there weren&#039;t many flaws as it really just wanted to be a short bit of fun and present that to the viewer.  Of course it did have moments where it went a bit overboard for my taste, but there really isn&#039;t much to say as to why I didn&#039;t like this show in the grand scheme of things.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this to anyone?<br />
<br />
Well, that&#039;s a toughie.  If you really want to kill about an hour of your time, and you don&#039;t mind whatever horrors await, go ahead and watch this.  Himegoto really is just a piece of anime short fluff that stays true to what it was supposed to be in the first place.  If you can handle what it presents to you, you may get a laugh or two out of this show.  (I certainly did)  However, if you want something serious, this thing is a far cry from that.  I can&#039;t really discredit this show for being what it is because in all fairness, it really does stick with its gender bending schtick for the entire run-time.  Overall, if you just want to have a bit of mindless fun, check this show out.  (Just make sure you&#039;re watching this alone, or other people might pose some questions.)<br />
<br />
Overall Score:  (6.12/10)

    Himegoto is more than just a comedy or a romantic drama...<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a beautiful work of art...<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a social commentary on mistreating people who don&#039;t fit with &quot;the norm&quot; and the effects that said mistreatment can have on someone.<br />
<br />
From episode 1 we are introduced to the lead character, Hime Arikawa, and the 3 girls who make up the student council. These characters are all crucial to the plot and serve as the driving force of the shows narrative as it is through the poor treatment of Hime by the student council that reveals the true purpose of the show, this is especially clear in the case

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349112">
        of 18-kin.<br />
<br />
18-kin sees Hime as nothing but a toy that she can use for her sick and sadistic mind to torture, she doesn&#039;t care for him in the slightest unless it directly affects her ability to play with him. Hime is constantly put through vile and wicked torture and humiliation by 18-kin and the student council, but throughout this Hime somehow begins to open their hearts and they eventually start to become what seems like friends.<br />
<br />
This is all comes together at the end where they put their new-found respect and friendship with Hime on the line and must reflect on their treatment of him in the past. I won&#039;t spoil anything as this is possibly the greatest end to a series to date.<br />
<br />
<br />
Himegoto manages to reach everyone who views it differently, whether that be through its themes of friendship and family, heartbreak and betrayal, or even it&#039;s more &quot;mature themes&quot;, because of this I believe that this show transcends all other media and stands as not only a masterpiece of a show but also a masterpiece of art.<br />
<br />
In short, Himegoto is the greatest thing ever created.

    I will be the first to admit that I laughed. I enjoy the &quot;trap&quot; trope in anime and the ridiculous situations they find themselves in sometimes. <br />
<br />
But the few funny moments don&#039;t save this show from make its audience really uncomfortable. Himegoto is a prime example of Stockholm syndrome at its finest. First off he&#039;s being blackmailed to dress as a girl as they steal the premise from Ouran High School Host Club where the club pays off a large debt that Hime owes. They basically own him. The other characters frequently molest Hime but it&#039;s funny and perfectly okay because he&#039;s a cute cross-dressing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312374">
        boy! Several times throughout the show Hime nearly gets raped because something &quot;awakens&quot; in the male characters that no longer care that he&#039;s a male... in fact that&#039;s even better! <br />
<br />
At one point Hime finally gets fed up over the treatment towards him and leaves the club... And he&#039;s sad about it and does not stop cross-dressing despite it being forced on him by his abusers. It only takes the other characters to come apologize for him to go back to hanging out with them. And it just goes back to him being forced into lewd situations once again! <br />
<br />
As I said before. I laughed while watching this. I laughed at Hime&#039;s misfortune. Most of the situations were ridiculous and would work fine in an ecchi comedy anime. They&#039;re still not exactly wholesome but they weren&#039;t too extreme until this show took it too far. Put the boy in the cutest girls contest! Funny! It was unwilling AND he falls and flashes everyone and the crowd loves it... ok getting more creepy than funny here. <br />
<br />
So overall I&#039;d say that Himegoto was pretty funny but it takes things way too far trying to make the trap trope the main focus and leads to way too many uncomfortable situations.

    Himegoto: Secret PRINCEss is a 2014 comedy anime about Hime Arikawa, a highschooler boy who is in overwhelming debt thanks to his parents&#039; greed. One day, some of the debt collectors of Arikawa are beaten up by the Shimoshina Student Council, which consists of R18+-san, Unko-san, and a girl who&#039;s name I forgot. They make Arikawa join the Shimoshina Student Council and pay off all his debts on one condition; he has to spend the rest of his highschool days dressed up as a girl.<br />
<br />
Now the &quot;comedy&quot; in this anime is really repetitive. Most of it consists of &quot;look, he&#039;s a trap. haha get the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337221">
        joke? he has a dick, it is funny, now laugh.&quot; There was only one joke I chuckled at and it in itself is very lowbrow. The art is fine, it was probably a low-budget anime anyways. The voice-acting ranges from &quot;ok&quot; to &quot;distracting&quot;, especially in R18+-san&#039;s case, her voice kind of distracts you because it&#039;s so differently recorded than the rest of the cast. The characters are really one-trick-ponies with one joke to their name. And the main character is really really dumb, especially at the ending of the series. Now, it&#039;s not a bad show (not too far from being bad though.) It&#039;s just why would you watch this? It&#039;s humor is repetitive, all the characters are one-sided, the audio is somewhat ok, and the art.. well the art is fine I guess. If you would ask me, no, I would not recommend it. (if that wasn&#039;t clearly obvious.) <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s not bad. Just extremely mediocre.<br />
<br />
Himegoto: Secret PRINCEss gets a 5/10 from me. Traps are gay.

    Before I actually begin I&#039;d like to clarify some stuff. First off I am a straight man, not that&#039;s there anything with being gay. Second I&#039;m actually a fan of traps and gender benders. (I&#039;m a man damn it I have needs.) Finally I&#039;ve read the manga which is a lot better than the anime (but still pretty bad.)<br />
<br />
As far as storylines going the show begins as a knock off of Hayate no Gotoku being that he parents ran off leaving behind a debt with the Yakuza. (Japan&#039;s Mafia) His debt is paid off by the student councils of the terms of him living the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163681">
        rest of his school life as a trap.<br />
Aside from the whole beginning I&#039;d say it was pretty original a concept. However its only good concept wise. There is no actual plot, and most of the show is trappy fanservice goodness. Though the writer went overboard with the traps. I know there&#039;s like six cross dressing students at that school which ended up being just annoying.<br />
<br />
Animation and character design were pretty mediocre, especially with guys crotchs moving around like its some kinda jello. I know my crotch has never moved like that and I&#039;m sure even if I wore some panties it still wouldn&#039;t move like that!<br />
<br />
Music was forgettable especially since I had to watch a three minute commercial to watch a two minute video, I pretty much skipped past it after the first watch.<br />
<br />
The only character development was how the protagonist Hime slowly went from I hate cross dressing and being a trap to women pride!... Okay, slight exaggeration but still he his his chest as a man. Yeah I swim with a T-shirt on but if I got somehow removed I wouldn&#039;t cover myself. Especially in such a feminine way.<br />
<br />
Overall the only reason I can see someone watching this is if they&#039;re A. Paid to watch anime and review them, or B. A fan of traps or believe said traps are actually girls. (Sweet ignorance) I myself genuinely enjoyed it, but unless your A., or B. I wouldn&#039;t watch it.
