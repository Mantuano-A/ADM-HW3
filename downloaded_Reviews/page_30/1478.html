    You might have heard that Kemono Friends, a CGI full length anime, is the most popular show of the Winter 2017 season in Japan. It took a LONG time for any western anime fans to even notice this show, yet alone take it seriously. But after giving it a fair chance, I truly believe that Kemono Friends is one of the most special and unique anime we have.<br />
<br />
First, I&#039;ll get a few things out of the way. The animation and art style are lacking in massive ways. I don&#039;t think anyone will try to argue with that. The voice acting is also pretty shoddy in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243808">
        a few places. However, there is so much more to Kemono Friends than just that. <br />
<br />
The biggest draw of the show is that it has some of the best world-building I have ever seen in anime. Kemono Friends truly understands &quot;show, don&#039;t tell.&quot; As the series goes on, viewers start to learn more and more about the weird and mysterious world this seemingly simple story takes place in. If you&#039;re reading this review, it&#039;s probably too late for you now, but the theory-crafting and discussions had around Kemono Friends in Japan and the western world were so much fun. By drip-feeding us information about the world, fans were able to come together week to week to discuss their new ideas and knowledge. The mystery of the park might make this one of the best mystery anime too!<br />
<br />
The story seems simple at first; a lost girl and an animal girl wander around a park filled with animal girls trying to find out what the lost girl is. Every week, they meet other animal friends and help them with their problems as they progress towards their own goals. But the aforementioned world-building is what draws this all together. In the background of each episode, new things are added to the viewer&#039;s knowledge-bank about this unique and interesting world. As your interest in the world grows, so does your love for these relatively simplistic, but fun characters. You grow to love watching them simply have fun, as the dark past of the world unfolds. <br />
<br />
It may sound pretentious, but Kemono Friends is not a show that you&#039;ll get the full enjoyment of just by watching and forgetting it. Kemono Friends was a show that I spent HOURS thinking about and talking about, because it was simply so amazing that I couldn&#039;t get it out of my head. I watch a lot of anime, so usually I&#039;ll watch an episode and immediately forget about it, even if it&#039;s something I love. I simply couldn&#039;t do that with Kemono Friends. It&#039;s one of the first shows of the over 300 that I watched that I wanted to discuss in-depth and engage with on all levels. And I know for a fact that it wasn&#039;t just me that felt this way, because it has truly become one of the most popular anime in Japan. <br />
<br />
I honestly cannot predict how enjoyable this show will be outside of the special environment that existed while it was airing. Thousands of fans, albeit mostly Japanese (luckily, I understand Japanese!), came together week after week to theorize and enjoy the wonderful world of Japari Park. You might not be able to get over the art or voice acting and that&#039;s fair. But watching Kemono Friends is the most special experiences I have ever had in my life-long anime career. I don&#039;t know if anything will ever be able to replicate this feeling, but I hope that future creators take notes from Kemono Friends. <br />
<br />
Give this show a shot, at least until episode 4. If you watch to that point and still can&#039;t get into it, it might not be for you. I 110% advise you to make your own theories about the show and THINK about it as you watch, taking breaks when possible. Go back and read the episode discussion threads on Reddit to get a sense of what people thought at different points in the show. Enjoy the wonderful fanart and other creative pieces that the huge, dedicated fanbase of Kemono Friends have made. I hope that this show gains more traction in the west, because it is so disappointing that so many western fans missed out on the magic. If anything, push through it to get ready for the inevitable (considering those sales) season 2 and prepare for a new round of magic!<br />

    I don&#039;t think anyone expected much after the first episode. Indeed, the first episode was a very much dull program, there was some cute stuff in, but not much to justify continuing with the series,<br />
<br />
Kemono doesn&#039;t really start until you sit through the credits of the second episode, until which the true nature of the show finally starts revealing itself to you. It&#039;s slow it&#039;s subtle, but it doesn&#039;t bog you down with exposition dumps every five minutes (*cough*LittleWitchAcademia*cough*). Which is even moreso impressive considering this was meant to be a low budget collab for a failed mobage that&#039;s so bad it makes Kancolle look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243802">
        competent. However, unlike Kancolle, which seems like soulless corporate drivel designed to pander to as many people as possible, there&#039;s a real heart to Kemono Friends and a real passion behind its team.<br />
<br />
So yes, the animation is pretty crap and the anime gets pretty cringy at times, but keep in mind the target audience for this is for really young kids and the fact that adults can get a kick from the surprisingly deep lore hidden in the subtext or enjoy the show for what it is proves the strengths of this anime. And all in all, the charm of Kemono Friends is simply impeccable.<br />
<br />
It ain&#039;t perfect, but watching this genuinely made me happy, it reminded me of simpler times and simpler shows for babies. Perhaps that&#039;s the secret after all. An enjoyable piece that relaxes the mind and puts it to ease without being condescending as most media aimed at a younger audience do. <br />
<br />
For what it&#039;s worth, it&#039;s worth checking out.

    [Edit: I have finished watching the show and it is awesome. The show gained momentum after episode 4 (the time I wrote the original review) and went from 4.30 to what you see now. This should tell you a lot about whether or not you should pick up his anime.]<br />
Kemono Friends is a fun journey that isn&#039;t really directed to any of those who voted for the anime. It is clearly a kid&#039;s show that attempts to teach some animals&#039; facts and give a little bit of fun. It had a little bit of dark side that adults can enjoy speculating about which isn&#039;t really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239609">
        confirm yet.<br />
The story can be as simple as a lost child running into different animal girls with very variations of behaviors but they all are very cute. Or a little bit serious as some speculated that this is set in the future where humans went extinct or something which I don&#039;t really think is the case, but there are some hints in the first episodes to lead to that. <br />
The sound is good and matches up with character&#039;s appearances and cuteness. This could be &quot;cute animal girls doing cute things&quot;<br />
The artstyle is the weak point of this show but I never judge a show based on its budget. <br />
The characters are all, so far, less than an episode old then they don&#039;t show up which makes sense since the anime wants to introduce as many animals as possible while still focusing on the main two characters. <br />
There are many things that made me wait for each episode and unanswered questions like: where are all the humans and what happened to them? What are these creatures that are dangerous to the animals? And how would a show that hints to humans annihilation (in episode 4) end since it is targeted towards children? <br />
This is a very fun light ride just like the theme of this season. I recommend watching it if you want to drawn in the moe while laughing at how cute those deadly animals are represented. <br />
It deserves an 8 gut I gave it a 9 because of this huge underrated of the show. <br />

That CG is terrible yo..<br />
<br />
I rarely write reviews but I wanted to help people decide whether to check this out or not because that rating doesn&#039;t do it justice.<br />
<br />
/ So About That CG<br />
<br />
First off, most people are getting a bad impression from the CG. I can understand where people are coming from about this. The chase scene in the first episode definitely did not make a good impression on me ( it was the worst scene out of the entire series so far). But after that, I got used to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240779">
        it and found it cute and charming. I think most people that stuck with it can agree. But if you insist on not watching/continuing just because of the CG then that&#039;s your decision.<br />
<br />
Additionally, some people also get the impression that it&#039;s a yuri anime but it&#039;s not. It&#039;s more about friendship and adventure. While I&#039;m not against yuri, some people seem to dismiss it as a yuri moeblob fest. If anything, it&#039;s subtle and certainly not the focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
/ So What&#039;s It About?<br />
<br />
Girl wakes up to find out she&#039;s in a large park filled with animal human hybrids called &quot;Friends&quot; and goes on a journey throughout the park to discover what animal she is.<br />
<br />
Along the way questions begin to pop up. Are there other humans? What&#039;s up with this park? Why are there these hybrids? Who is she really? It goes on.<br />
<br />
/ So What Do You Think?<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been enjoying this series a lot and it&#039;s definitely worth giving a try if you&#039;re into something chill, cute, and funny with some mystery to push it along. The fact that all the characters are based off animals is quite refreshing and makes for unique and charming characters.<br />
<br />
Every week I look forward to what new characters will show up and what new clues will be revealed.<br />
<br />
/ So ..TL;DR<br />
<br />
- Fun adventure with a potentially darker mystery<br />
- A different scenario every episode<br />
- New fun and unique animal characters every episode <br />
- Characters have great voices and personalities that match the animal they&#039;re based off of<br />
- Yuu Kobayashi voices one of the characters, it&#039;s great if you like her voice<br />
- Character designs are cute and unique, which is why you see a lot of fanart<br />
- Learn interesting animal facts!<br />
- Chill, cute, funny and charming<br />
- OP and Ed are nice<br />
<br />
/ So Any Final Words?<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t expect everyone to like it. But it&#039;s worth giving it a try if I managed to pique your interest. ( There&#039;s cute girls yo )<br />
The first episode is slow , so I&#039;d recommend watching at least 2 episodes since that&#039;s when they start introducing more characters and moving forward.<br />
<br />
If you do end up trying it out I hope you&#039;ll enjoy it as much as I do!<br />
And if you do, spread the word!<br />
If you don&#039;t well, good for you.<br />

    I have a confession to make. When I watched the first episode of Kemono Friends with my friend we ended up setting the playback speed to 2x to get through the episode. <br />
<br />
Mind you this was back at a different time. Before anyone knew that Kemono Friends was going to be good, or be as popular as it was. Actually, it was on the day it came out. Me and my PV and studio ignoring self looked at the summary and I liked it. Kemono Friends was actually one of the shows I looked forward to this season. Before we started my friend said he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243817">
        had a bad feeling about it. I told him not to jinx it, but he did. So I thought...<br />
<br />
Kemono Friends is the perfect example of why you shouldn&#039;t drop shows. Or at least you should give shows more of a chance. I was close to dropping it myself but I didn&#039;t, and I think it was all the better for that. For each week that I watched the show, the more attached to it that I got, and the more it became to grow on me. The animation was bad but the rest was so great and so enjoyable to watch. The first episode may have been terrible but each one after that only got better and better.<br />
<br />
Under the crappy animation and lackluster art there is a really good show here. What the show is able to do is build up this impressive lore and backstory while also exposing the viewer to the comfy times of the friends that live on the island. This gives it the feel of a children&#039;s show but it has much more to it. The comfiness on its own is nice but it&#039;s the mixture of both the darker undertones and that comfiness that really allows this show to shine. Because the two are pitting against each other in a way it creates a unique atmosphere that the show surrounds itself. <br />
<br />
Even more impressive the show was able to foreshadow the events that would happen later as well as slowly leak out information relating to it. They are experts at doing this I would say and many things that you may pick up on early may be important later down the line. In Kemono Friends things aren&#039;t throw in haphazardly, they are there for a reason. Their ability to do this hints towards Kemono Friend&#039;s wonderful storytelling and narrative abilities. <br />
<br />
All of the characters on Kemono Friends are likeable. They aren&#039;t the deepest but they do develop and grow over time (or for most characters over their episode). While I&#039;d love for more depth what Kemono Friends has worked well for itself and what it&#039;s going for. <br />
<br />
As bad as the art is it&#039;d be expected the sound would be too. However, I really like not just the OP and the ED but also the OST. It may not be much but they do a geat job of picking the right songs to fit the right moods. Their chilling music is quite chilling and I like the use of dubstep for the cerulean moments. The playful sounds that they have during the happier moment all match the mood as well. The OST works so well together I even really like Serval&#039;s voice as well. <br />
<br />
It may look like a bad show but Kemono Friends is anything but. It&#039;s able to provide both high moments of hype and soft moments of comfy. The balance between the lore and the comfy is just stunning. Kemono Friends took some of the best aspects of children&#039;s shows and worldbuilding lore shows and shoved them together. And the result was something well worth watching.<br />
<br />

    This anime is not for everyone. It&#039;s an anime for children and adults, but not for teenagers.<br />
<br />
This is an anime that is a lot more enjoyable if you know about it&#039;s roots. Is based on a mobage produced by Nexon. It was part of a crossmedia project that sadly failed. The game closed a month before the show aired.<br />
<br />
The creators of this anime weren&#039;t expecting to make something huge. They are a very small team with a very limited budget from a game that failed.<br />
<br />
And this is how everything starts. With a poorly animated first chapter, some novice seiyuu and low expectations from the creators

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240886">
        and the community.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story starts pretty simple. A girl lost in some kind of park where people with animal features called &#039;&#039;friends&#039;&#039; live with no memories of who or what she is. This is the story of her travels as she goes to a place where she can learn who she is. She is followed mi Serbal, the first &#039;&#039;Friend&#039;&#039; she encountered in the park and together they solve problems for other friends using her SUPERIOR HOMO SAPIENS MIND because the &#039;&#039;Friends&#039;&#039; have the sapience of an human but the intelligence of an animal.<br />
<br />
The plot is pretty simple. Sometimes you don&#039;t need more to make something enjoyable but that&#039;s not everything. Kemono friends uses the &#039;&#039;show, don&#039;t tell&#039;&#039; in the explanation of the subplot. Japari Park is an abandoned park. You can see things left by humans in state of decay like some post-apocalyptic setting. If you pay attention some friends talk about how they where normal animals at first but something transformed them. (Spoilers chapter 4)At some point a character even is surprised that not all humans are extinct. (/spoilers)<br />
<br />
You can watch it for a mindless cute adventure or you can dwell more in the story of the world and his mysteries.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Visuals:<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t talk about this without talking about the infamous first episode. In the first minutes you can totally see it. Even someone who doesn&#039;t pay attention to detail can tell how low budget everything was. How they where trying to do something with what they had but it wasn&#039;t enough. It&#039;s a really bad first impression that made a lot of people stop watching in that moment. Fortunately is not a sample of how everything goes in all the other chapters.<br />
<br />
After they got the hang of it in the first couple episodes you can see an improvement. The CGI is more polished but not perfect and that works in it&#039;s favor. Kemono Friends has a hand-made feel to it, like something that is not perfect but you can see the effort the team put in it. The design of the characters is very good and with a lot of variety. They managed to be faithful to their animal counterpart in a lot of details and every character has his own personality that is evident just by looking at them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personal opinion:<br />
<br />
I liked this a lot. This season has more animes of cute characters doing cute things but this one feels like the more natural of them. Even it&#039;s flaws add to the charm that it has. The characters feel more real and you can see in every episode how everyone tried their best.<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime is more than the episodes themselves. Is the story of the underdog. With how limited they where they managed to make good characters, an interesting story and the voice actor gave it all they had. How it rose to be one of the most popular this season when even their creators weren&#039;t expecting a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a show for children or adults. You either need the ingenuity of a kid or the maturity of an adult to enjoy it. Don&#039;t watch it if you expect &#039;&#039;traditional&#039;&#039; anime. Watch it as a whole and get outside your comfort zone of good visuals and expert teams. If you can see past it&#039;s flaws and see not only the anime but the project as a whole you will see one of the best shows this season.

    Question: Should I watch Kemono Friends?<br />
<br />
Answer: If you have any interest at all in Kemono Friends, then you should watch the first episode.  If you get through the first episode and like it at all, or still have interest in the series, then you should watch the second episode.  If you get through the second episode without dropping the series because it looks bad or seems too childish or simplistic, then you will have no trouble watching the whole thing, and let me tell you, the viewer who sticks around for the whole show is in for an absolute treat.  Dig in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243814">
        and enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what is Kemono Friends?  There are two main answers to this, depending on what you focus on.<br />
<br />
Firstly, Kemono Friends is a show made with the idea of being enjoyable for everyone.  It is made in a style similar to that of a children’s show, and the producer has said that it was done that way with the intention of it being family-friendly, which it succeeds at, with only a couple of points that could even be considered questionable throughout the entire series.  It is a story about Kaban-chan going on an adventure across different biomes of an expansive zoo; meeting various animals-turned-people, called Friends, along the way; and overcoming the various challenges that present themselves along with the Friends’ support.  The story is charming, which even the 3D CG ends up contributing to.  Kemono Friends is definitely not the best looking show of the season, but the artists did a great job of bringing what they made to life.  The Friends aren’t humans who look like animals, they’re animals who look like humans, by which I mean they maintain their animal traits and behaviors.  The Friends don’t know how to read, they don’t know how to use or make tools, and usually they’re found doing things you would expect them to do if they were still normal animals.  It’s a kind of characterization that I’ve never seen in anime before, and it works well.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Kemono Friends is a mystery series; not the kind of mystery where there’s a crime to solve, but rather it’s a mystery about what exactly is going on.  I don’t mean that the series makes you feel lost or confused in the moment, this was never the case, instead the series makes you wonder about larger questions, such as where is this all taking place, is there something more going on here, and what, exactly, is a Friend.  There’s a subtlety to the writing and the setting that I’ve never seen anime do as well as Kemono Friends.  Gradually the pieces of the puzzle are put into place, episode by episode, rather than in huge lore dumps that fill the whole picture in at once.  This means that while the picture is slowly being filled in you can make guesses as to what it will turn out to be, which makes the story engaging.<br />
<br />
To wrap things up, I want to say that Kemono Friends has earned its popularity.  The series exploded in popularity in Japan essentially overnight, a third of the way into the season.  That outpouring of fan support is what originally got me to give the series a second chance myself, and I’ve been hooked ever since.  The first episode can be rough at times, but trust me that the staff has succeeded at polishing it into a gem of a show.  To those of you willing to give Kemono Friends a chance, welcome to Japari Park.<br />

    Just watched the finale, it made me cry and I&#039;m still crying half an hour later.<br />
<br />
This show is clever, in its writing, in the way it strategically employed the scarce resources it had. in the way it uses it&#039;s setting to educate, in the way its plot development mirrors the development behind the show, in the way it builds intrigue and spurs discussion with its more subtle elements.<br />
<br />
And it all does with a cute simple story and characters that anyone can love.<br />
<br />
All this make the show great and promise a great future not just for the series itself but for the series it will inspire.

    &quot;The real treasure is the friends made along the way.&quot; What is often said as a joke lies at the heart of what makes Kemono Friends so great.<br />
<br />
Our heroines, Kaban and Serval are on a simple journey to find out what kind of animal Kaban is and meet other animals or &quot;friends&quot; along the way. We quickly see this story of &quot;girl explores land filled with animal people with her animal companion&quot; become so much more however.<br />
<br />
We see Kaban go from having no memories to creating new ones to cherish. Serval finds a new best friend and the friends they meet on their journey are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243828">
        impacted by their small acts of selflessness in a big way. In short, Kemono Friends is about the joy of meeting and forming bonds with other people.<br />
<br />
What made me so excited for Kemono Friends each week was seeing the next of chapter of friendship and adventure unravel. Kemono Friends was a joy and it will be missed.

    Kemono Friends is the My Little Pony of anime. Both franchises exploded in popularity after their shows aired, notably gaining an audience of adults. When My Little Pony was popular, I couldn&#039;t understand bronies and what they saw in MLP. Today, I can&#039;t understand what people see in Kemono Friends.<br />
The story is ridiculously simple. The main character, Kaban, travels around with Serval to different habitats and meet different friends along the way. The closest thing to an actual plot or goal is that at first the two of them are traveling to a library to learn what kind of animal Kaban is, but this gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244502">
        figured out before they even go to the library and the discovery adds absolutely nothing to the plot. It rinses and repeats the &quot;meet new friends&quot; junk for every episode with some little things thrown in here and there. People claim there are some &quot;deeper, darker elements&quot; to this story, but those elements are neither dark nor deep. The show&#039;s very obviously for children and as such these &quot;dark elements&quot; are hardly dark, not even for a children&#039;s show. If anything, it&#039;s just a very, very basic conflict.<br />
The animation is incredibly awful. I have yet to see an all CGI anime that looks good, but this one was probably the worst that I&#039;ve seen. The movements of the characters are very stiff and awkward. The characters suffer from sameface and all have the same bodies (not including their hair, but most anime seems to rely on telling their characters apart from a glance with their hair, which is a really bad thing). The backgrounds are actually drawn (instead of modeled) and look pretty nice, which is really the only good thing I can say about the art.<br />
The voice acting is alright. It&#039;s not really anything special. A lot of the voice actresses are amateurs, so they&#039;re pretty good for newbies, but again, nothing too special.<br />
The characters have little to no personality. Every episode introduces a ridiculous amount of new characters only to be ditched in the next episode in favor of new soulless characters. The writers slap a quirky gimmick or two to each character and call it a personality. As such, most of them are really forgettable and bland, but that&#039;s to be expected with a show with such a large cast, right? But not even Serval and Kaban have personalities. Kaban is...smart? Serval is...outgoing? That&#039;s all I got from them.<br />
This show is overall insultingly simple and incredibly boring. I hardly enjoyed it. It was just as boring as every other slice of life moe anime, except these moe girls are animals and it&#039;s even more dumbed down since it&#039;s for children. If you&#039;re under the age of four or enjoy kid&#039;s shows like My Little Pony and, I dunno, maybe Care Bears or Barney too, you&#039;ll enjoy this show. If you aren&#039;t, please watch literally anything but this anime.

    i used to think anime as a medium had already shown me all it had to offer. after having watched kemono friends anime has once again taken me by surprise and shown me something i&#039;ve never seen before. this series marks a paradigm shift for me and the way i look at anime has changed for ever. series i used to think were excellent pale in comparison and i&#039;ve found new meaning in series i never cared for before.<br />
<br />
kemono friends is an example of high culture anime. it&#039;s the purest form of the medium. it doesn&#039;t need the visuals, narrative, or soundtrack that other anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242129">
        might use as a crutch in order to distract from their shortcomings. some might fall for the misconception that these elements are the important building blocks for anime, or other audiovisual media for that matter. for a time i thought this way too.<br />
<br />
in the case of kemono friends it comes to light that none of these are important in the expression of the medium. it is demonstrated that the difference between a great anime and a truly groundbreaking one is not found in the sum of its parts. in fact the wasted effort on these basic elements could even detract from the conveyed meaning of a series such as this. fortunately kemono friends wastes no effort on these trivialities and instead invests heavily where it really matters.<br />
<br />
the series speaks to me on a level that can&#039;t truly be expressed with conventional communication. the best way i can put it is to say its message is conveyed directly to the human condition. the types of feelings we all share to some extent and experience in different ways throughout our lives regardless of background.<br />
<br />
it is not first and foremost aiming to entertain you, it does not ask you to think hard, it does not appeal to your emotions. it does something else. it fulfills a need in me that i did not know i had up until this point. picture maslow&#039;s hierarchy of needs with another level on top of the hierarchy. a need that is on a level so highly elevated above the rest that the need for self-actualization through your physiological needs all become essentially the same in their insignificance.<br />
<br />
it is truly difficult to put into words. calling kemono friends a contemporary masterpiece is a description that i would say falls short. more than that kemono friends is perhaps the crowning achievement of human civilization, only time will tell. for the time being at least it is unsurpassed by any other works throughout history.<br />
<br />
would i recommend it? first consider that as a consequence of watching this show you might no longer be able to see other anime - or any media for that matter - in the same way you used to. you might start having dreams about visiting japari park to meet animal friends. perhaps this series is best suited for a seasoned audience, or a burnout at the end of their journey who wants one last thrill before moving on.

    It&#039;s hard to write about Kemono Friends because it doesn&#039;t easily compare to anything else airing in 2017. It wears a proud low-budget aesthetic, and has no sakuga cuts, being a CG-only show - there are plenty of still shots, mistimed or absent lip flaps, reused poses and cycles, and unfinished-looking backgrounds. The studio is an unknown, and so are the voice actors. Despite this it has the trappings of being a major franchise, with a huge cast of characters, a solid adventure/mystery plot, and tasteful application of moe, with the additional wrinkle of plotting that shares some lineage with American cartoons and movies as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243857">
        well as the anime/manga/light-novel sphere - Disney shows such as Gravity Falls or Ducktales come to mind as apt comparisons, or perhaps Spielbergian film such as E.T. or Jurassic Park.<br />
<br />
If I had to pick one thing that defines the show, it&#039;s a &quot;can-do&quot; spirit of self-confidence permeating it, the kind of spirit I recall from 1970&#039;s-era anime. The characters are stereotypical in that their personality is approximately like watching videos of wild animals, but they aren&#039;t cynical, neither do they slot directly into the cliches common to comedy anime. And there are many, many characters to pick favorites from. It&#039;s all very sincere and upbeat, even as the plot and worldbuilding elements add a darker framing: Every interpersonal conflict has a happy end, here. The Friends are happy to meet each other. They help each other out.<br />
<br />
The impoverished nature of the production also has a side-effect of adding dynamic range, in those moments where the camera actually moves or a unique animation is used. But it is all jarring at first, in the same ways that old, low-budget anime tends to be jarring. Plausibility concerns are often ignored in favor of getting a great moment. Judging by the popularity, it works for most people. Give it a few episodes to warm up.<br />
<br />
Edit: Some additions after viewing the final episode. One of the stronger technical points of the series is the soundtrack. It&#039;s mostly fitting and at times, pretty exciting. The conclusion really hammers home the themes of friendship and learning, and it leaves a setup for future installments that leaves a few potential plot threads open, vastly expanding the scope of the world beyond Japari Park. And it bears repeating that there really isn&#039;t another show quite like this one.

    I started to watch this series in an ironic manner, to laugh at the unusual, and quite frankly not that good animation as well as the cliche moe girls. But, as it turns out, the joke was on me. Because I&#039;m LITERALLY A 19 YEAR OLD MAN, A NINETEEN YEAR OLD GROWN MAN, A FUCKING NINETEEN YEAR OLD MAN and Kemono Friends made me want to cry, it hit me so hard. The love that blossoms between Bag-chan and Subaru-chan is beyond this world, too pure to exist in this realm. There&#039;s no way to describe the wonderful friendships of this Japanese animation. Unlike the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243926">
        real world, everyone is friends here. Even a robotic tour guide shaped like a cat furby and referred to as &quot;b0ss&quot; becomes a loyal friend and buddy for life. You&#039;ll never find a furby like this anywhere else. There are often times when Japari Park is so immersive that I feel I am in their universe, within the wild and the kawaii kemono girls. I have found myself thinking &quot;god I wish I were in Japari Café right now&quot;, Kemono Friends is just that great at world building.<br />

    Kemono Friends is a show that requires patience. It&#039;s maddening how well this show surpassed my expectations, in ways I could never expect.<br />
<br />
Kemono Friends takes place on the island of Japari Park, which is subdivided into various areas based on geographic features such as the Savannah and Jungle for example. Our main characters Kaban-chan (a human to us, but a mysterious creature to the animals of Japari Park) and Serval-chan (a humanoid serval) travel through Japari Park in search of what kind of animal Kaban-chan is. On their journey, they encounter various anthropomorphic representations of animals in their respective habitats. <br />
<br />
The anime is episodic in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243844">
        nature, with slice-of-life and comedic elements as well. I&#039;ve had many memorable laughs throughout the show. It seems to possess its own charm that is difficult for me to put into words. One who is briefly inspecting this anime upon curiosity may make the fool-hardy judgement of labeling it as just &quot;a kids&#039; anime;&quot; however, that is not entirely the case. Throughout the series, their is an underlying post-apocalyptic/human abandonment theme that can be seen through the abandoned buildings, structures, and vehicles throughout Japari Park. It&#039;s clear that Japari Park was inhabited and maintained by humans for quite some time before being abandoned after a disaster of some sort years before the anime takes place. It&#039;s quite an impactful thought to keep in mind. Another subtle theme present in this anime is how Kaban-chan&#039;s journey represents human evolution in terms of geographical diffusion and human technology. Kemono Friends begins in the Savannah, which represents the cradle of civilization - the birth place of mankind. Kaban then travels through the jungle, mountains, desert, and onwards, as we can similarly trace through the diffusive movements of ancient humans from Africa outwards. As for technology, Kaban-chan highlights the various technologies that eventually lead to civilization, such as construction, use of tools, fire, and writing. This is all done in a very meaningful manner.<br />
<br />
In terms of music, the bgm and sound effects are cute and fitting, but nothing that really stands out too much. The most memorable one for me was some sick trap beat from the snow episode. The opening is extremely catch though (please approach with caution, seek rehabilitation if the addiction affects your daily life). The ending theme is great, yet not as addicting as the opening. What makes it superb is how it resonates with the underlying post-apocalyptic theme I mentioned earlier, through the visuals of an abandoned theme park. I&#039;ve also heard the lyrics support this as well, but don&#039;t quote me on it.<br />
<br />
And now, let&#039;s talk about animation. It&#039;s pretty BAD (this is quite a lenient euphemism to describe it). I can, however,  be a little forgiving considering the show was made by 10 people at an amateur studio with a piss-poor budget. If I had to anything positive to say in this regard, it&#039;s that such poor animation can only leave room for improvement.<br />
<br />
Another consideration to keep in mind: Art doesn&#039;t carry a story or one&#039;s enjoyment of it. That isn&#039;t to say its an element to be discarded when reviewing an anime, but it&#039;s something that shouldn&#039;t be weighted equally with aspects such as character development or plot. <br />
<br />
But overall, the juxtaposition of such terrible animation and production value with a simple, yet fulfilling story that possesses meaningful layers of depth to it actually swelled my enjoyment for this anime. I would say it lent the anime a bit of charm that makes it feel unique. <br />
<br />
7.5/10

    It&#039;s only February, and we&#039;ve already got anime of the year right here.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to explain why exactly this anime is so enjoyable. I, too, like you, was a hard skeptic after watching the first episode. But the more I watched the more entranced I got with the world of Japari Park. From the all-stars voice actor cast to the quirky and interesting characters, Kemono Friends is very subtle in what makes it good. It&#039;s no wonder the opening theme single charted #1 on anime titles on the oricon chart.<br />
<br />
If after watching episode 1 you are utterly confused as to why this show has gained

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241248">
        so much traction in the japanese fandom, keep trucking on and I&#039;m certain that a few episodes in you will, as I have, gotten totally engrossed into this magical universe.<br />
<br />
Also shoebill-chan is mai waifu, do not steal.

    &quot;Where Am I?&quot;<br />
 What&#039;s this? Why am I enjoying it so much? It looks terrible, if you take a still shoot from any scene it&#039;d seem like it was a shitty CG art made by some random amateur. Maybe it&#039;s this world created with a very minimal population, the feeling of a fairly big enough environment where everyone has a happy life with happy events and happy friends but for some reason something seems to missing be, somehow there is a feeling of emptiness in this land of cute animal anime girls and microbiomes. There are big rivers with destroyed bridges, tall mountains with abandoned

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241216">
        stores, long and lonely empty roads, etc.<br />
 Japari Park is a world in where animals seem be the only inhabintants, and in these place the same animals interact with creations made by men(buildings, vehicles, books, etc.). They adopt human traits and seemingly create a culture of their own. Some create, and others destroy. Some want to find secrets about the wolrd they live in, and others just want to have a good time. Dispite being a vast place with some few living in it, Japari Park seems like seems more lively that it should have to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#039;s Everyone?&quot;<br />
Humans build great monuments, create beautiful pieces of art, and try to rationalize everything in this reality; but they are physically weak compared to other creatures, they lack qualities that other species had gained through evolution. And when we don&#039;t compare ourseleves to other animals, we compare ourselves to others who we think are better than us. But what if there was no one but yourself, animals, and all that was created by previous inhabitants of the world? You&#039;ll try to find your place, try to find answers of who you are. As a modern human, you were raised in this enviroment of comfort in where your kind controls a vast amount of natural resources to sustain themselves. As an isolated human, there are things that only you can understand that other species don&#039;t(if they could talk there might be chance that they would praise you), and that&#039;s what will make you special from other kinds of animals. <br />
&quot;What kind of animal am I?&quot; is the question  that that Bag-chan asks herself frequently and it is also the main focus of the first half of the series, and when she finally founds out her identity as a human, there a rises a bigger question: &quot;What happened to all humans?&quot;. For some reason this question gives a me chilly feeling. The fear of extinction is some how rational(Right?). If sunddenly everyone was gone but yourself, you&#039;d probably want to know why is that. Some people may have already compared this to &quot;Life After People&quot; with cute anime girls, but I can&#039;t stress this enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Will Happen at The End?&quot;<br />
 By the time I&#039;m writing this, the series hasn&#039;t really ended yet. So probably the resolution of this series might be something related to some random magical event or something like that. There are questions that I&#039;d rather not hear them answered.<br />
 Personally, I don&#039;t want this to end. And I&#039;m not talking about making it +50 episodes long. I don&#039;t want a resolution, that is. If the 12th and last episode were to suddenly go missing for some reason and never to be restored again, I&#039;d be really glad. <br />
 I don&#039;t want a dark twist. I&#039;m just glad that the world of Japari Park was present for a brief moment in my life.

    &quot;Kemono Friends is the Evangelion of our Millenium&quot; <br />
A man with good taste on a random topic<br />
<br />
When i read this critical the first time i thank that it was kind of exageration or moron fan reactions. So you can imagine my shock when, when i tried this anime, i understood that this man was absolutly, 100% in the true. <br />
<br />
Kemono friends is a complex masterpiece with a truely special scenario that talk about friendship, perversions and discover of life in a way that i had never encounter in my life. After seing this anime you are, truely, a different person.<br />
<br />
Of course the animation is one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246377">
        of the badest animation i have ever seen, but it is really forgetable after discovering the other strong points of this masterpiece. The story, the character writing, etc etc ... <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say too much without falling into spoilers, but if you have read this critical, please, let see Kemono Friends and let it enter in your life. You will see thing in a all new way after that. <br />
<br />

    This is established within a few minutes of the first episode: Kemono Friends starts as the story of Kaban, a girl lost in a savanna, meeting up with Friends (girls with animal characteristics, such as ears, tails and behavior to some extent), and trying to figure out what kind of species she is (which is obvious to the viewer: Kaban is human).<br />
<br />
However, what the story is actually about is the development of Kaban&#039;s character as she makes friends in an unknown world. Trying to help Friends and being helped, the meek girl slowly discovers her qualities and starts to believe in herself. This aspect of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244648">
        the story, of self discovery and improvement, is very satisfying to watch. This isn&#039;t, however, the only likable aspect of Kemono friends.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen reviewers say that you can only grasp if this is a show for you after watching the second episode. This is, however, untrue. The first episode is a good representation of what you will see happening most of the time on this show. This also includes quality drops in animation, which are unfortunately present within the first minutes of the first episode.<br />
<br />
Kemono friends is a story about friendship. It portraits things such as affection; sympathy; empathy; honesty; altruism; mutual understanding and compassion. While real friendship is a very long and complex process, this show does well on establishing convincing friendships between its characters (given how short is is, even if full length), which is pleasant to watch.<br />
<br />
Most characters, however, get very little screen time, and one may or mat not care for them enough to keep watching and keep discovering new characters.<br />
<br />
Not only the setting is interesting, but is presented in an interesting way. Kemono friends is an excellent example of &quot;show, don&#039;t tell&quot;. Even if this is a show targeted towards children, there are aspects about the story that you need to think and discuss quite a bit to understand. Doing this can be very interesting. However, it&#039;s not necessary to enjoy the main aspects of the story.<br />
<br />
The character designs are inventive and pretty. Even if the animation is lackluster, and sometimes outright bad, you only need to see the amount of fan art made for this show to understand how much the character designs are highly acclaimed. The voice actresses manage to pay homage to these designs.<br />
<br />
The worst aspects of Kemono Friends are the quality drops in animation and repetitive, unremarkable soundtrack.<br />
<br />
The amount of enjoyment that I got out of Kemono Friends is outstanding. Throughout the final episode, many scenes made me very emotional. This was only made possible through the convincing friendships that were established throughout the show (as I mentioned earlier) and what these characters meant for me. Anime has not made me this emotional in a long time. For this reason. I rate Kemono Friends 10/10. It doesn&#039;t need to be perfect to be a masterpiece.

    I make it sure, who wants to read through half a book in order to get a review.<br />
<br />
Kemono Friends is, in my mind, for sure a series worth watching, at least Season 1. <br />
The animation may be a be rough around the edges but otherwise it is a more than solid anime with fun characters to meet, an interesting story and even some fun information to lean about the different animals shown during the show.<br />
<br />
Above that, if this had been longer or they up&#039;ed the animation a bit in Season 1 already, this would be an easy 10/10 for me.<br />
<br />
Watch it, enjoy it as you

        will, Kemono Friends sure left me impressed and happy.

    I really wanted to like Kemono Friends. I really did. After all; a show that manages to create a cult following strong enough to rekindle interest in Zoos must be doing something right. Though I have failed to figure out what that is, unfortunately...<br />
<br />
At first glance, Kemono Friends looks like a cheaply made Slice of Life show with cute animal girls and little else to its merit; and although the people who coaxed me into watching this show would argue, it&#039;s basically exactly that. Kemono Friends has little to set it apart from the run of the mill &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; shows we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252209">
        get at least 2 of every season other then its setting, but this time i would argue that the characters aren&#039;t even particularly cute...<br />
<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
Put simply... The show looks bad... It&#039;s done entirely in CGI by a small team with few resources and it definitely shows... be it jankie movement or lip flaps that don&#039;t match the characters speech, the whole show is just awful to look at (somewhat of a big deal for a visual medium...) When it comes to this part of the show one of two things will happen. Either you won&#039;t be able to get past just how ugly the it looks and that feeling never goes away, or you will get use to it to the point where it doesn&#039;t bother you anymore and you only notice it when it screws up... Which it does... A lot... This is a shame as many scene could have been vastly improved had the animation been hand drawn rather then CGI.<br />
<br />
Character Design is rather subjective so i won&#039;t dwell on it to long. Personally, I don&#039;t find them to be particularly appealing or cute. The show does its job of personifying the characters respective animals, but some (not all) seem to be a tab bit overdesigned. With weirdly long gloves and out of place bow-ties, some of the characters just seem a bit off. That isn&#039;t to say that a couple of the characters don&#039;t hit the nail on the head with their designs, just that a lot of them are a bit off the mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The voice acting in this show seems rushed at best and phoned in at worst. A lot of the deliveries lack emotional depth and the voice actors don&#039;t seem particularly invested. Perhaps it&#039;s because the material given to them doesn&#039;t give them much to work with or the general air of cheapness surrounding the show makes otherwise good aspects seem much worse then they actually are, but in the end it just sound rather bland. There is no English Version as of this writing, so it&#039;s impossible to say wherever that is any better. <br />
<br />
The music in the show is one of it&#039;s few strong suits. With a whole 2 tracks being average. Thous being the battle theme, and ending theme. With the rest being largely mediocre and forgettable. The main theme of the show is a generic &quot;You&#039;re in Africa&quot; track and chances are, if you&#039;ve ever seen a cartoon with a scene that takes place in Africa, you&#039;ve heard something rather similar. The Opening theme is passable, but i didn&#039;t end up watching it more then once as it didn&#039;t contain anything extraordinary, and the song was average at best. The ending theme, on the other hand, was rather pleasant and helped sooth the headache that the show caused me over the past 20 minutes. Although nothing special, it did its job of calming the mood and closing out the show with a relaxing tune. Lastly, the battle theme is on of the few things in this Anime i thoroughly enjoyed. Every time it started, smirked in excitement as it made every fight seem more dynamic even if what was actually happening on screen wasn&#039;t all that impressive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Writing and Characters:<br />
<br />
Many would argue that this is one of the show&#039;s strong suits, and although it isn&#039;t straight up bad like the rest of the show, it still barely manages to achieve average. The story revolves around Bag (a lost human) and Serval (a cute cat-girl). Roaming an island inhabited by humanized animals. Wile trying to find out what animal Bag is, they meet several characters or &quot;friends&quot; (hence the name) and pick up a few mysteries along the way (because in all reality no one would watch this show unless there was some sort of hook to keep interest). The show is very episodic, with each episode largely focusing on two or three characters at a time and their respective problems; with a string of clues to a mystery that lousily keeps the show together and moving along. This leads to the episodes being rather formulaic, and each plot being telegraphed far in advance. Seeing as every individual character only appears for a short time none of them get properly developed or have any sort of progression other then Bag herself. This leads to characters that are mostly 2 dimensional (beaver likes to build things but is bad at it. She later gets good at it. That&#039;s it. That&#039;s the extent of her character), or in the worst cases characters that are completely 1 dimensional, though that only happens about 2 or 3 times throughout the show. Many of them make odd decisions and unrealistic actions for the sake of plot convenience. To use  specific examples without spoiling anything; one character fails to figure out that the person she is chasing and hates is the same person who she&#039;s being hearing great things about and has become a fan of... Or the PPP, a pop-idol group that was never mentioned before hand (outside of episode previews) who are supposed to be famous all around the island. As for the aforementioned mystery, there isn&#039;t much to it, and anyone paying any attention beyond &quot;none&quot; will probably figure out rather quickly where the show is going. Though to be perfectly fair; this is from the prospective of someone who watched it mostly in one sitting rather then on a week-to-week basis as it was intended.<br />
The show also has these odd clips of experts talking about the given animals in each episode. Although novel, these clips feel largely forced and down-right crigy at times. They don&#039;t add much and the Anime would have probably been fine without them, but at the very least they are concise and don&#039;t overstay their welcome.<br />
<br />
All in all the show cute, and easy to digest. Nothing overly complicated happens and if all you are looking for is a wholesome time with cute animal girls with not to much substance that you can just turn your brain off and enjoy, this show fits the bill fine (I personally found myself in a rare situation of needing to pause the episode to stop laughing at a rather well executed gag). That being said there isn&#039;t much substance here, and it doesn&#039;t hold up to critical thinking particularly well, and unlike other shows with the same issue it doesn&#039;t anything else extraordinarily well to make up for it. If you just want to watch cute anime girls doing various things there are better options out there that do it far better then this.
