    It ended. I really ended. After forcing me to laugh so hard every episode, it disappeared just like that. Well, I&#039;m not going to talk about the emptiness in my life or how desperate and lonely i&#039;am after watching the last episode, but instead, I&#039;m going to give you all some insights on the anime by writing this review.<br />

I&#039;m going to start by the story first. To be honest, it&#039;s kinda&#039; hard writing about the main idea of the story. Why? BECAUSE IT DIDN&#039;T HAVE MUCH OF A STORY. Okay here it goes.<br />
<br />
High school country delinquent, Kazama Kenji thinks that he got what it takes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138721">
        to be the strongest and the sole ruler of Fujou High. Kenji, despite of having no special traits whatsoever and frequently considered to be a norm, is the leader of the infamous “Kazama Gang”. Together with his two long-time friends who are also in the gang, it seems that nothing could possibly go wrong. That is until one day, the gang bumps into a Game Development Club consisting of four ‘unique’, or to be frank, strange -elemental freak- girls with their overly brute and outrageous behaviors. Kenji could probably be able to say goodbye to his hopes and dreams by the moment he was forced (I really mean by force) to joined the club.<br />
<br />
Despite of what i wrote above, this anime isn’t about any of those ‘ruling the school’ thing. This is the story of a boy who believes that he, himself is an ‘infamous’ delinquent at Fujou High. Instead of acting like one, he spends his days of high school slacking off and playing meaningless games in the club that he was forced to joined. Sometimes he also acts like a good guy and the others will say &quot;aren&#039;t you supposed to be a delinquent?&quot;.<br />
Reluctant at first, he soon finds the club and it’s member to be exciting and interesting and also often defends it from the others who tries to destroy(disband) it. Well maybe not, but one thing for sure is that Kenji isn’t living a normal high school life. <br />
<br />
D-Frag is an example of an anime that actually has no meaningful plot at all. It mainly (almost every time) revolves around Kenji, playing board games and throwing limitless funny punch lines at everyone around him until sometimes he literally ran out of breath. Yeah, i think that’s all i can say about the story, nothing more. But that’s not the point. What makes this anime to be considered a very entertaining one is that such plot contains such humorous jokes that surely hit the mark every time and aren&#039;t predictable. Behaviours that you don’t see every day will make you burst into tears of happiness.<br />
<br />
The artwork in this anime is not what you can say as a masterpiece, not even close. It’s plain, simple, but still very comfortable to see. It seems that Animes such as these aren&#039;t in a need of great and extraordinary art. Character’s design are very enjoyable and hilarious to see. Ranging from cute to roguish, bald to long-haired... i don’t really know how to describe in words coz&#039; i find that some are ‘indescribable’, well maybe because they&#039;re just a bunch of random people.<br />
<br />
Voice actors did a great job in their voice acting. They make a great impression on how the characters are. What really caught my attention is definitely Kenji’s punchlines, so random yet so funny to hear. Not only the voice acting, the soundtracks fits the anime perfectly too. The Opening is very joyful, cheerful, energetic, and funny. It really makes the mood before watching the anime. The ED is sang by the seiyuus and that makes it even more interesting to hear.<br />
<br />
Characters is what to be called ‘unique’ or maybe simply random. None of the characters have a normal personality as that of a high schoolers and it effectively supports the comedy which is the main focus of the anime. If you’re hoping for character’s developement, you&#039;re looking in the wrong place, my friend. Character development in this anime is so small that it could be considered as none..... But you wouldn&#039;t even mind anyway :D.<br />
<br />
Score<br />
Story : 8<br />
Art : 7<br />
Sound : 8<br />
Characters : 8<br />
Enjoyment : 10<br />
Overall : 9<br />
<br />
D-Fragments or D-Frag! or ディーふらぐ! is a very funny and enjoyable comedy-anime. It is indeed the best example of a comedy anime which can be considered as a &#039;good&#039;. Personally it&#039;s my favorite in this winter season. If you think you have a reasonable sense of humor and is looking for an anime that could make you laugh until you lose your common sense, without no doubt i recommend you this anime!<br />

    &quot;So, I think we&#039;re going to start the king&#039;s game now.<br />
this game has a number of sticks in which one is inscribed the king. The rest are commoners. The commoners should follow the king&#039;s command at all cost. But since there are only two players this time, we are going to go with a simple game where the one who draws the king will win.<br />
...So why the hell are these two ready to kill each other?!?!?&quot;<br />
-From D-Frag<br />
<br />
First of all, let me put the summary of this whole anime in one sentence.<br />
<br />
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEND!<br />
<br />
...Then, before I actually begin, let me explain that because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136817">
        this is a comedy like nichijou where nothing makes sense but everything is funny, I&#039;ll grade this differently.<br />
<br />
PS. Absolutely no spoilers, but some words may suggest indirect minor plot points.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m wrong? There isn&#039;t much of a story?<br />
<br />
No, this is not that simple.<br />
<br />
Creating a comedy requires more skills than one might think. Especially for a theme like D-frag, one needs to be very thoughtful. This is not just senseless laughter found in nichijou, or a laughter at the dumbness of baka to test. This gets a game as casual and simple as king&#039;s game or the war of thumbs and create something funny and interesting. Nobody wants to watch two men playing the game of thumbs, but in this, yes you do. The ability to make something boring funny is a grandiose skill that requires much attention and imagination.<br />
<br />
Another criterion that I absolutely loved was the continual unfolding of funny behind stories and mysteries that just cracked me up. I cannot explain this without spoiling, so I will go on.<br />
<br />
Story was a work of art. Many will disagree and say there was no much of anything for story, but this, like I said, need to be given a whole new method of grading.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
Sure, the animation is not the best in the world, and we can&#039;t help but notice the rainbow colors of the hairs.<br />
<br />
However, these are not necessary factors when making a comedy.<br />
<br />
What D-frag wanted and needed was an animation where one could easily crack up, or be caught in adorableness, and this type of animation was its soul mate. Instead of hiring IG entertainment or Ufotable, the simple and &quot;chibi&quot; animation was what it really needed.<br />
<br />
But this alone wouldn&#039;t get the anime 10, so I gave art a nine. A fluent movement in unnecessary scenes are also a factor to crack people up, but unfortunately D-frag didn&#039;t contain this element. For that I gave art a 9.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
Starting from the seiyuus this time, in contrast to how I usually grade the sound. The sound is in three parts: BGM, OP/ED and voice over.<br />
<br />
The voice actors are some of the greatest in the world. For Shibasaki Roka, who needed both the yandere-type voice and cute-type voice, there were not too many in the anime history who could do both but the jack-of-all-trades voice actor hanazawa kana. Roka&#039;s voice requirements overlapped well with Sengoku Nadeko of monogatari series, and there was no better candidate than Kana in this voice over. Then, as for our main-character delinquent, we have katsuyuki konishi, the prime voice actor of delinquents. In addition, for the voice actor of sakuragaoka, a girl-like boy who had to sound both like a boy and a girl, we had the voice actor of hayate, shiraishi ryoko. We have the woman who changed Japan towards cuteness, aki toyosaki, for the best girl, along with takao in the story, funabori. Not to mention of course, they all did their jobs admirably. Even the extras&#039; voice acting was admirable. However, there were times when the voicing was a little awkward--especially when kazama played the straight-man role. To begin with kazama&#039;s voice actor is not aced in straight-man role. Also, the times when the voice actor shouted &quot;ba-ka!&quot; weirded me out a little bit. Still, kazama&#039;s voice actor did his job splendidly and the ba-ka was understandable for the genre of the anime, so I gave voice acting a 9.<br />
<br />
As for the opening, I at least hated the song. However, as we learned from a certain song called &quot;Platinum Disco&quot; and the opening of &quot;Haiyore Nyaruko-san&quot;, there are songs which deserves A+++ for the music quality and other songs which deserves A+++ for catchiness, and this opening is the latter. Still, the song could annoy some people off, so I gave this an 8.<br />
<br />
The ending, on the other hand, was in between quality and catchiness. It was both easily remembered in the ear and sang well. Still, the song was not good enough to be given a 10, so I gave the ending a 9.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the BGM&#039;s were done splendidly. They weren&#039;t cliche or repeated over and over. They were used thoroughly and well. Some songs inspired urgency and even awe and a BGM that does the right job deserves a 10.<br />
<br />
So all in all, I gave the sound a high 8.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t you just love all characters?<br />
<br />
We have all characters with their own appeals, especially Takao and Funabori, who are not in the main 5 characters but are more famous than the main 5&#039;s. I cut it off also because of that--the main characters are not given enough attention, especially Sakura. She, although being a part of the club, shows little significance in the whole anime. I also cut off points for the teacher characters that appeared at the last second.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
BUT WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT ALL THESE?<br />
<br />
D-Frag certainly cannot be a masterpiece, considering each categories carefully.However, they can make people laugh like no other, and they don&#039;t need any of these categories to do so. The story? WHO CARES! The art? WHO CARES! The sound? WHO THE HELL CARES!!! The characters? WHO IN THE HELL CARES!!!!! D-Frag is simply fun. It does not bring up the nonsensical exaggerated comedy in Nichijou, or the eternal dumbness in baka to test. They are fun because they are. Even if the story is nonexistent, even if the art is premature, even if the sound is annoying, even if the characters aren&#039;t fully developed, D-Frag can turn the tables and create enjoyment out of it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
D-Frag is certainly, without doubt, the best anime of the spring/winter of 2014. There might not be stories to be awed at, or arts to be awed at, or sounds or awesome character developments to be awed at, but this definitely is an anime that you can be awed at.<br />
<br />
It most definitely needs more attention. If you haven&#039;t watched it, you should immediately start watching.<br />
<br />
Then, happy anime-ing and may the anime be with you.

    &quot;Just Finish Watching D-Frag&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at the poster thinking that maybe this is just your another typical Comedy anime but No<br />
after watching all 12 episode, I was stunned how Marvelous it is.....<br />
<br />
This anime has no doll moments at all...Every episode is worth dying to see &#039;cause how great and enjoyable it is.<br />
The only downfall is that there&#039;s only 12 episode they should do more maybe a hundred lol. <br />
I don&#039;t know why they stop....maybe the budget or the ratings but who cares they should do more and can&#039;t w8 for<br />
the next season...  <br />
<br />
D-frag has no main story at all... It&#039;s all about the characters goofing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144537">
        off..If you want to watch a feel good anime <br />
 try this one it won&#039;t let you down. D-frag will you make you laugh and it will make you feel that your in your teens again having a crush on someone it will make you feel in love lol... and after you finish all the episode you want to beg for more episode.... I do.<br />
<br />
&#039;Cause now a days it&#039;s so rare to find a good harem,comedy with a little bit of romance and school club.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Characters are great,always having a good time, They always making fun of the main protagonist and also the characters are very wacky &amp; crazy but likeable....<br />
<br />
The Bottomline is this D-frag is a pure comedy as it&#039;s finest and don&#039;t take it too seriously,just have fun while watching it. <br />
<br />
<br />
PS: I Recommend this anime only if your a fan of Romance,School Club,Harem &amp; Pure Comedy (Kenji X Takao)

    While searching for a comedy based anime, I stumbled across one with a strange title: D-frag. The premise seemed unappealing and boring, with a generic setting that didn&#039;t promise anything spectacular. Nevertheless, intrigued by the title of it, I began watching it, and I can say I was pleasantly surprised. D-frag is comedy/harem anime, though it is not your typical ecchi/comedy anime out there. So what makes it hilarious? I will try to explain it below.<br />
<br />
~Story~<br />
<br />
First of all the comedy is based on the manzai, where a &quot;Tsukommi&quot; (straight man) retorts the actions of the &quot;Boke&quot; (funny man) who creates a funny situation. This is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204161">
        quite frequent in japanese comedy shows, and being a personal fan of this type of comedy, naturally appealed to me. However, if this type of comedy doesn&#039;t appeal to you, then this may be not suitable for you.<br />
<br />
D-frag focuses on the delinquent Kazama Kenji, who with the help of his gang, the &quot;Kazama&quot; gang, intends to take over his school. This doesn&#039;t go as intended and in the process he is forced to join the game creator club (temp), composed of the most strange girls. From here on audiences observe how Kazama deals with the bizarre club members, leading to absurd and hilarious situations. These range from typical everyday life situations, to the same events a lot school comedies have to offer, such as territorial fights or festival games, naturally taken to the extreme absurdness.<br />
<br />
D-frag has little story to offer, besides the actions of the game creator club (temp). The story is split in mini arcs, each with enough comedy to make you laugh, making it perfect for this type of anime. It also tagged with the romance and harem category, though the harem aspect is not the main focus of this show, neither is the romance. Moreover, it is used to enhance the comedy. <br />
<br />
~Characters~<br />
<br />
Being a comedy based anime, D-frag has a lot of characters to offer, each with its own charm. As it is a harem too, there are a lot of female characters but these are not detrimental to the anime; which is to say, it doesn&#039;t exhibit an excessive focus on the females. Personally speaking, the protagonist Kazama was of the most interesting character as it was not your typical main protagonist. He doesn&#039;t take romantic interest in the female lead characters, neither does he always accomplish his goals, in fact he is often helped by someone, which is bonus.<br />
<br />
Other character that stood out, and is my personal favourite, was the teacher Sean Conne Conne, who clearly represents the actor Sean Connery. His character, moral values and actions are very refreshing to the anime, besides enhancing significantly the awe factor of this character. Naturally, character development is nihil in this anime, in addition to the fleshing out of the characters.<br />
<br />
The secondary characters also play an import role D-frag: these have all certain personalities that makes it easy to distinguish from the others. While the protagonists create absurd and hilarious situations, these are often enhanced and supported by the actions and comments/retorts of the secondary characters, and vice versa. There are also different factions present, each with their characteristic attribute, for example, the baldies or music bands. The good thing is that these are all simple and not such impressive characters, they&#039;re in fact simple people even though the anime portrays them as &quot;badass&quot; characters.<br />
<br />
~Animation and sound~<br />
<br />
The animation quality of D-Frag is nothing outstanding, though well executed, what is to be expected from a modern show. The art style of D-frag was toned down a bit from the manga, which was at first rather lackluster, and is a welcoming change. Character designs are varied, yet are nothing remarkable. The facial expressions were well done, which was of importance for the comedy gags, as without them it would have been worse.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack used in D-Frag was nothing outstanding and it could get repetitive at times, yet there were some compositions that fared well with the different sketches and situations it was trying to portray to the audience. The voice actors performed their roles well, fitting with their character&#039;s personalities, as in addition enhancing the comedic element of the anime.<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~<br />
<br />
I personally enjoyed D-frag a lot; It made me laugh throughout the whole duration with hilarious and absurd situations, as well as the wide assortment of characters. There were naturally some gags that got old or were predictable, besides of having no story direction whatsoever: this was nevertheless a small drawback. So if you are interested in watching a comedy anime with an enjoyable harem, or just are searching for something to watch, D-frag may be something for you. Just don&#039;t expect any deep characters or story.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    Am I the only one who thought this anime was going to have explosions and have a war-like theme? Yeah? Oops. With the title D-Frag!, I thought this would have something to do with a hand grenade. Nope. It&#039;s one of those one-guy-bunch-o-girls-in-club anime and I was putting it off until one of my friends suggested it, claiming it was hilarious.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10 <br />
Sigh. Not again... The plot definitely did not interest me at all. I&#039;ve watched plenty of shows where a guy goes into a club with a bunch of girls in it, yadeeyada. Despite the synopsis being so bland, I found that the actual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163913">
        plot was progressing at a nice rate. The setting actually moved outside of the club room (phew) and there were a variety of conflicts that the protagonist faced.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art is definitely very average. Typical school uniform, typical characters all with different hair color, and typical school setting. The art also tends to focus a lot of attention on the head of the characters. I don&#039;t particularly like how the hair is colored - it uses gradient, you&#039;ll see what I mean if you plan to watch this. Nothing particularly stands out... until those fantastically inputted little, special scenes. The art will suddenly catch your attention and I guess it is because of this contrast that I paid closer attention to the show. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The background music does not stand out too much, which isn&#039;t a bad thing. This show is very light-hearted and most of the time, if not all, it fits with the scene. The little sound effects are nice. Voice acting is also great, but personally, the male protagonist screaming all the time gets to me. <br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
WOAH THERE. Yeah, this anime gets a perfect score for character. Each character is unique, all weirdos. Maybe there&#039;s one character here and there who have the generic behavior of all school-related anime but the variety of personalities is extraordinary. This anime somehow makes even the minor characters of the show stand out. It&#039;s quite genius, actually. This anime may not stand out much in terms of the other criteria, but I fell in love with all the characters - even those who only appear for a max of two episodes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Each episode did not fail to elicit laughter from me. The oddity of all the characters along with the random plot and plot twists combine to create an anime that does not fail to please. For a school anime, this one does not fail to deliver entertainment. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
Do give this a try and if you want to test this anime&#039;s waters, try two episodes, not one. I felt the first episode does not truly represent the rest of the show. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a little chuckle and fall in love with the characters. However, if you cannot handle the male protagonist screaming for half the episode every episode, this may not be for you (take into consideration that some people enjoy this screaming!).

    Feeling a little tired of late? Having trouble keeping thoughts organized? Well perhaps you need to D-Frag, or so the title seems to suggest. This show is a Haganai/Seitokai no Ichizon type clone with overly vivid personalities and a rather unique combination of attempted coolness and comedic cuteness. Basically, a supposed wannabe delinquent, with Sonic the Hedgehog sharp hair, named Kenji is coerced into joining a game development club. Except that they don&#039;t really develop games. Rather, they just lounge around and occasionally play some games, and occasionally get into trouble with other groups.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a very lighthearted slice of life with some

        not-so-realistic personalities, this may be a good choice. I say maybe because you&#039;ll either love or hate the overall feeling of the show. Personally for me, the attempted coolness came across as immature and rather dull. Others have shown a very different opinion though so you might want to give the first episode a shot and see if you enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The animation is fair overall with a vivid color scheme and a lot of over-dramatization. Backgrounds are fairly average and likewise for shading. The characters are pretty unique in styling though I felt that facial animations were a bit lackluster as characters didn&#039;t seem to respond much to external stimuli.<br />
<br />
I guess there is a bit of action though most of it is extremely light and more of the comical nature. Fighting by splashing water or dirt on each other? Kind of cheesy if you ask me. There is a slight amount of ecchi though more like suggestive references, they probably tried to incorporate something like Seitokai Yakuindomo but didn&#039;t really succeed very well. Otherwise you just have bouncy from Buchou and a bit of cross-dressing.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The Engrish OP is pretty representative of the show, taking a very shonen-based cool and combining it with cute-ish female voices. The song is pretty discordant with little melodic value. The ED is a bit more melodic but still has the overly-playful vibe that just feels much more fitting for an elementary school. The BGM is pretty light but serves its purpose. There are a lot of effects, due to the comic nature of a lot of events.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of veteran VAs here but I feel like they over-cast for a lot of the roles. Shizuka Itou is the standout as Buchou but most of the other roles just didn&#039;t have enough characterization to merit the strong VAs. Especially painful were Kana Hanazawa and Kana Ueda&#039;s roles; what&#039;s the point if their character can&#039;t act cute and tsundere, respectively?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
This is frankly a glorified slice of life show that is based heavily on character-interactions, so I wouldn&#039;t expect much in terms of a central plot. If there is anything holding the story together, it would be the repeating pattern of someone or some group trying to get the fake gaming club closed. The oddball group works together to somehow try and overcome impossible odds. I guess it helps that the student council chair, who you never see actually doing student council chair-like stuff, is in the club. Some episodes are episodic while others clump up to form mini-arcs. There is a bit of a climax near the end but nothing mind-blowing.<br />
<br />
The more important thing to note here is the over-the-top nature of the characters and antics in this show. If you&#039;re just watching for the comedic aspect, then this is all fine. However, if you apply an ounce of thought into it, be prepared for very little to make sense. Besides the numerous plot and character holes, the school apparently has multiple infamous gangs and groups running around and causing messes, with relatively little discipline being dished out. A lot of behaviors and events are just so out of the ordinary that the merest thought of plausibility is cast aside.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Granted that this show isn&#039;t going for realism, I still find it annoying that the characters were so two-dimensional. Yes, the characters have interesting traits, but these feel unshakable in an unnatural way. A good example is Roka, a seemingly quiet and chibi figure who apparently possesses the comic ability to &quot;conquer&quot; others by putting bags over people&#039;s heads. Yes, she&#039;s interesting in a curious way but you never get the sense that she&#039;s remotely relatable. The sadistic student council chair, Chitose, acts cool all the time but just once you&#039;d like to see her out of that annoying facade- don&#039;t bother waiting. The only characters that really have any merit in my mind are Buchou, who harbors some feelings for Kenji, and Kenji himself. Everyone else, and mind you this includes a huge amount of secondary characters, are just fluff. While it&#039;s true that the character interactions had a lot of character (no pun intended), it was painfully lacking in depth.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
It&#039;s probably pretty clear by now that I didn&#039;t have a very pleasant experience with this show. Maybe I&#039;ve outgrown this genre, but I still feel there are much better works out there that provide much more entertainment value without having to resort to meaningless gimmicks and outlandish, unrealistic personality traits. While the show has some comedic value and a drop of relationship value, it is spread out too thinly to make much of a positive impact. If you agree in opinion with my other reviews in the genre, I&#039;d pass on this one.

    One of the most underrated animes ever. This anime will make you laugh so hard that the twelve episodes zoom by way too fast. I definitely recommend this anime to those that enjoy a protagonist who tries to act badass when he really isnt and really weird characters.<br />
<br />
Story - In terms of the story, it is very weak as expected of a comedy.<br />
It&#039;s focus is on the Game Creation Club and doesn&#039;t seem to progress anything further than that. There is some romance to it, but overall it is just comedy. Even though it sounds so bland and boring, you tolerate it because the ride

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154911">
        itself is really fun. <br />
<br />
Characters - The characters are all so lovable and funny. They each have their own way of telling jokes. The main protagonist is angry at everything because everyone acts so foolishly that it&#039;s cute. The members of the club have their own &quot;types&quot; (Fire type, darkness type, lightning type) and they take this sort of stuff so seriously that when someone as sane as the main protagonist approaches the scene, you can&#039;t help but agree with him. The fact that you can relate so well with the main character, who is in a situation in which every character he meets, including his best friends, is out of control makes it a soothing experience.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound - I love the opening theme. It matches the humor of the whole anime. It&#039;s all about having fun. They also match the amount of energy that is  put into this anime.<br />
&quot;We&#039;re a group of geeks with ambition, despair, and angler fish... just kidding&quot;<br />
It&#039;s really quirky too. <br />
The art style is also really comedic. Characters make the weirdest facial expressions and in general it makes everything funny/cute.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - If you enjoy a good laugh, definitely watch this anime. You won&#039;t even worry about the plot, you just want something else to happen so they can just act themselves. <br />
<br />
Overall - Story is obviously bad, but the whole comedy portion has been nailed. Definitely watch this for the sole reason of comedy.

    &quot;Love to fight! Love to fight! I love to FIGHT!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is actually from the opening of this anime. The name is &quot;Stalemate&quot; by IOSYS jk Girls. D-Frag or D-Fragments is one of the anime that I enjoyed watching in the winter season anime as stated in my previous Noragami review. However, I didn&#039;t enjoy this anime fully as I did with most anime that I have watched.<br />
<br />
D-Frag was directed by Seiki Sugawara and was produced by Brains Base who did some wonderful anime like &quot;My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU&quot; which is a high school slice-of-life comedy just like the anime I am reviewing now.<br />
<br />
STORY (5):<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136725">
        story takes place in a high school setting. A student Kazama Kenji was forced to join the Games Creation Club by its members. So what you are going to expect from this anime is how Kazama Kenji gets to bond with the members in the Games Creation Club who are all girls. <br />
<br />
Of course, there are some funny moments. Those moments to me are fun to watch but it didn&#039;t make me laugh out loud. The best moment is in episode 6 when Hachi Shio makes a love triangle with Roka &amp; Kazama. I really watched it and never get bored. <br />
<br />
This anime builds up tension in the later episodes which I see in most anime I watched. Like when the later episodes, they show a rival group and the battle begins. If an anime is awesome, then the anime must surprise me from the start to the end. However, this anime failed to do that.<br />
<br />
ART (7):<br />
<br />
The animation is refreshing to look at especially when it comes to the character designs. For example, Roka Shibasaki&#039;s design is very cute but sometimes can be normal in some situations.<br />
<br />
SOUND (7):<br />
<br />
Both the opening and ending songs were very addictive.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have to mention the opening song because I have said it in the introduction.<br />
<br />
The ending song was addictive. The song starts with Batsu Game. Batsu game means punishment game. The ending song is &quot;Minna no Namae wo Irete Kudasai&quot;.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (6):<br />
<br />
Every character has their unique personalities. I am fine with all the characters. At least the characters never show me any annoying traits (ie. crybaby, arrogant, whiny). However, the characters didn&#039;t stand out well enough for me to love them.<br />
<br />
There was one character who looked a lot like Harima Tenma from School Rumble and that character I am referring to is Hiroshi Nagayama. He wears dark glasses like Harima Tenma but his hair style looks different from Harima.<br />
<br />
Ataru Kawahara wears glasses but he is interesting as a masochist who can tolerate pain. Next time, I would host a show with him (if he is real) to be an assistant in &quot;Rate the Pain&quot;. Nah, just joking.<br />
<br />
Roka is very cunning and she always tricks Kazama into doing things for her. Like for example, she can manipulate people by showing her cuteness and her creepiness. This is very similar to Yuragi Hakoniwa from Noucome. She is cute but can sometimes be very intimidating.<br />
<br />
Chitose Karasuyama reminds me of Yozora from Haganai with her sadistic attitude.<br />
<br />
I seriously find that most of the characters resemble like some of the characters I knew from previous anime.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION (6):<br />
<br />
Although this anime has its fun moments. They weren&#039;t enough to surprise me in one single bit. The comedy wasn&#039;t strong. I wasn&#039;t laughing out loud throughout the anime but the animation was interesting to look at.<br />
<br />
The story didn&#039;t take me by surprise. A comedy has to make a person laugh out loud. If a comedy has failed to make a person laugh out loud, then the comedy is dull. Just like french fries, when you order a french fries and you take a bite and found that there is no salt in the french fries which makes them dull french fries. <br />
<br />
However, if you found the comedy very funny and entertaining, that&#039;s good. If you can relate with the characters better that&#039;s also good. In fact, I did appreciate the effort that Seiki did in making this anime a good comedy. But sadly, this anime didn&#039;t stand out among other anime that I have watched.<br />
<br />
So, for what it&#039;s worth, I give it a 6 out of 10.

    So, I just watched D-Frag!, it&#039;s a show I vaguely remember hearing about when it came out and then basically nothing. Every time it did come up, it sounded like another run of the mill high school comedy that runs on clichés and doesn&#039;t bring much new to the table, but I&#039;m going to try and explain why D-Frag! might be my favorite comedy anime of all time.<br />
<br />
It starts out simple enough, there&#039;s a club about to be shut down due to lack of members. It&#039;s full of cute girls, one of whom explicitly says she&#039;s gonna miss doing nothing. On the other side, you&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337189">
        got the main character, a juvenile delinquent who&#039;s the leader of his own gang but is actually a softy and will absolutely do the right thing in a pinch. Heard all this before? Yeah, the show knows, you&#039;re not supposed to take it seriously, because the characters don&#039;t, the club president forgets the name of her club and the gang bemoan stereotyping and side characters comment on how unremarkable the main character Kazuma is.<br />
<br />
The show is cliché, but it knows it&#039;s cliché and uses this to regularly make meta jokes, frequently in the form of Kazuma pointing out exactly what the audience is thinking when something ridiculous happens. An early example is when he gets in a fight with a girl who uses a cliché anime &quot;special move&quot; where she blinds her opponent by revealing a bunch of curtains that block out the lights and windows. This is really weird, actually, no, it&#039;s dumb. How did she set that up, did she know she&#039;d be having a duel in that exact part of the hallway or are these curtains set up across the entire school? How did she trigger them to fall with a snap? That makes no sense. And wait a minute, they&#039;re just curtains, Kazuma can&#039;t see, but he can just run forward and push through them, this won&#039;t stop him at all. All these thoughts went through my head, and they probably went through Kazuma&#039;s too because he does exactly that, runs forward and pushes through the curtains...right through an open window. That&#039;s...smart, no, it&#039;s dumb, but clever. Really clever. D-Frag isn&#039;t cliché because it&#039;s not creative enough to come up with something original, it&#039;s cliché because it knows the inherent value of these cliché moments and what mentality it&#039;ll put the audience in. From there, it can play to or subvert your expectations at its leisure because it&#039;s honestly not trying to manipulate you, it&#039;s just genuinely trying to be a fun, likable show.<br />
<br />
No scene demonstrates this better than the very next one after Kazuma falls out the window. Another cliché moment happens when Roka manages to catch him at the very last second and yells about never letting go no matter what. Kazuma then points out the absurdity of the moment, tells her to cut the moe act, and then suggests letting him go because he&#039;s not even that far off the ground so he&#039;d probably be fine if he fell to which she responds that it&#039;s not an act, sure she&#039;s a little eccentric, but that&#039;s just who she is and she&#039;s not apologizing for it. The show isn&#039;t apologizing either, it&#039;s a cliché high school comedy and it owns that. That self awareness and unapologetic attitude lead to an amazing ride.<br />
<br />
I barely scratched the surface of why this show is great, you can break down just about every scene just like this and see multiple layers of depth there, but basically, if you haven&#039;t watched this show, give it a try. Obviously it&#039;s not for everyone, no anime is, but it&#039;s criminally under appreciated and also has a great great GREAT dub if that&#039;s something you care about. On MAL it&#039;s got like a 7.6 which is insane, because I&#039;d genuinely give it a 10/10, I unironically loved every second.

    &quot;D-Frag!&quot; An anime that I was very skeptical about at first, even after watching the first two episodes I was trying to understand. I had no idea what was going on, but for some odd reason I still continued to watch, and I enjoyed every moment of this anime. It&#039;s not too often that I find and anime where I am laughing through every single episode.<br />
<br />
Score<br />
Story: 10<br />
Art:8<br />
Sound:8<br />
Character:10<br />
Enjoyment:10<br />
Overall:10<br />
<br />
Now first off we have the story, some people might not believe this has a solid storyline or any sort of plot so to speak, but after watching an Anime such as this you can just tell how much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187155">
        thought and work was put into it. Even the boring things in life that were done in this anime are a must see. It made everything more enjoyable and easy to watch. It was fun to watch!<br />
<br />
The art itself wasn&#039;t anything to crazy but it was more of a comfortable and relaxed environment if that makes sense. From the start it was just a feeling of &quot;Yes, this is good&quot;. Whether it was the chibi or the basic art, it all just felt right.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack for this anime wasn&#039;t the most amazing in all of anime history, but it was a perfect fit none the less. The voice actors for this anime were very good as well, you could feel every expression and feeling through their words, the reason I gave it only an 8 was one of the characters, they just sounded too much like a different anime character for me.<br />
<br />
What really makes this anime what it is, is this group of insane and outrageous characters. If anything, saying they are insane and outrageous is an understatement, right off the start of the anime you get a hit to the face with crazy. These characters being so overbearing at times or mentally unstable even, is the glue for this outstanding anime.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this anime thoroughly and couldn&#039;t stop laughing the whole way through. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys anime and would like something to cheer them up or make them laugh a lot. <br />

    Love to fight, love to fight, I love to fight..........<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anybody think that there are certain anime that would be better off as mangas, well, this is one of them, what it is basically something whose plot were pretty random and it only rides on one particular character, in fact this anime is depended on that particular character as he goes around being a typical victim of his club&#039;s antics, so no more fucking around and I&#039;m gonna be presenting my ratings for each of this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
Poor 3:<br />
<br />
Story:.........Simply, there isn&#039;t any and it would be better to forget what this anime&#039;s genre is.<br />
<br />
Sound: Though,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138029">
        I like the opening theme, the voices of the character&#039;s were seemly too mature for their roles, like Kazama, his seiyu  Konishi, Katsuyuki no longer has that youthful intonation, Chitose&#039;s seiyu Saito Chiwa, should have used the same tone that she did in Bakemonogatari that is if she would have did the voice of Tama, Roka&#039;s voice should have been done by Takahashi, Mikako instead of  Hanazawa, Kana, in fact Hanazawa, Kana&#039;s voice over would have been a better fit on Chitose. About, Sakura, her voice over should have been done by Toyosaki, Aki since she does have cutie girl tone that she once did with Soga Keena from  Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, only the voice of Minami was a match for her. The rest, well, there probably need for me to concern about it since they&#039;re more like support character and it doesn&#039;t matter who did who.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Art: Nothing much for me to say about it, except that the way  those male support characters were illustrated makes them too matured to be in high school, as if they have been there for quite a long time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
<br />
Kazama Kenji- well, I did mentioned that this anime rides on one particular character and it so happens that it is him, at one point I may have find it funny to see him going through all the antics that his club get into, but in another point I get annoyed by his tantrums and his rants when it would have been much easier if he just quit the club. Also, his tough guy looks makes him look like a dog whose bark was worse than his bite, despite of the fact that he can handle his own when dealing with delinquents, which it doesn&#039;t always end in success and he has to be saved by his club members, you might say that the rating for this category was for him.<br />
<br />
 Roka Shibasaki - I may have find her cute for being a small but terrible character, but overall I see her as nuts who should be seeing a shrink.<br />
<br />
Chitose  Karasuyama- she is basically the only character that I like to hate.<br />
<br />
Sakura Mizukami- I may also like her, but then again her character was simply an over hyped one.<br />
<br />
Minami  Oosawa - For me, she was the kind of character that one would describes her as a question than a statement, where one would ask &quot;Who the fuck is she?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Takao- the only character that I like, she is another reason why I give this category a 6.<br />
<br />
Ataru and Shio- it it weren&#039;t for them as well, I would have given this part a 4, since they&#039;re the ones who serves as the comedy part of this anime. <br />
<br />
<br />
Good 7.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: thought it lacks a plot, it was still enjoyable enough to be watch when it was Kazama who is in such predicament.<br />
<br />
Overall: Good as it is, funny as it is, so does this anime deserve another season????????I won&#039;t recommend it, like I&#039;ve said this anime should bet better off as a manga than an anime.<br />
<br />

    Okay, it&#039;s finished. I can&#039;t stand that D-Frag! is finished but the fact is yes, it&#039;s finished. After making me laughed so hard that my mom come to my room to say &quot;Hey, son. Do you go insane now?&quot; once a week, now is the time it&#039;s finished. So before starting the review, let me tell you how I feel before deciding to watch D-Frag! as my winter&#039;s anime.<br />
<br />
I always look at the genre of an anime before watching it, I started to watch D-Frag! cause some of the genres are School and Comedy. Yeah, I&#039;m a lonely guy without girlfriend or else so at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138799">
        least I have to taste some comedy so that I&#039;m not feel lonely anymore yay (?). Well, while looking for some info for D-Frag! on this site, I found out that the cover of D-Frag! is 5 girls and a guy that I think it would become a harem. But then, I was wrong, cause D-Frag! has a F-ing fabulous comedy so that harem stuffs were pulled out from my mind.<br />
<br />
Okay, let&#039;s head straight to the review.<br />
<br />
Story 8<br />
D-Frag!, a story(story?) that involves a leader of a famous delinquent gang named &quot;The Kazama Gang&quot;, but somehow nobody even knows him. Though he is a delinquent douche, he still helping someone to extinguish fire. And at the end, he forced to join a weird club named &quot;Game Production Club&quot; and he found the four not-so-normal girls.<br />
From the manga (chap special 14,5) at the end of the chapter, Tomoya-sensei wrote &quot;This extra doesn&#039;t relmaate to the main story (Is there something called &#039;story&#039; in this manga?)&quot; and yet i agree with him.<br />
For the plot itself, I think it&#039;s not a strange plot for me, it&#039;s just mainstream. I mean, A punk forced to join a club? But yet i realized, my inner self was just like &quot;Hey dude, this is a comedy you know, why you should be concerned about the plot, huh?&quot;. Yes, later on episodes 6++ I watched some arcs and I didn&#039;t expect that a comedy like this has it&#039;s own arcs. It&#039;s so amazing.<br />
<br />
Art 8<br />
Nowadays, the&#039;re many animes with great art, and D-Frag! isn&#039;t one of it. To be honest, the art of D-Frag! is just an average for me. But, for a comedy anime, it just really suit with the gag. In D-Frag!, there&#039;re so many characters that given their chibi style. I love it, very very love it. Especially when the chibi character is doing his/her gag while the others stay at the original body style. The sense of humour just spreaded out more.<br />
<br />
Sound 9<br />
The seiyuus do their role so good. For example Roka (HanaKana), she&#039;s good at voicing all types of expression such as cute, straight, and that &quot;yandere&quot; style. For Kenji (Konishi Katsuyuki), he&#039;s so good voicing his punchlines. For Sakura (Takahashi Mikako) her voice is suitable for her expression, the smiling-all-time-water-element-Sakura lel. And for the first time of my life, I just heard the tsundere version of Itou Shizuka wow (because Akeno, Wilhelmina, and Hildegard all have an adult voice :v), and she&#039;s really cute at it. And at the end, Ataru (Fukuyama Jun) the M type, he&#039;s so funny acting as an M while voicing like that. It&#039;s like I imagining that Dark Flame Master is tortured by Rikka :)).<br />
For the OST, the OP is good, energetic, and makes you feel to watch the episode ASAP (not because the OP is boring but it&#039;s because it gives you full energy so you&#039;ll ready to laugh all the time), and the ED that performed by Itou Shizuka, Toyosaki Aki, and HanaKana is great too.<br />
<br />
Character 9<br />
All of the characters has their unique personality theirselves. A tsundere, a masochist, an &quot;open hearted&quot; delinquent, even elemental lords! (water, earth, lightning, and &quot;darkness&quot; fire). It just....wow...And that evil head of student council character, it just rare to see the &quot;real&quot; leader of the school is the head of the student council. Recently, there&#039;re so many characters that joined to the story and they have their own unique personality that different with anyone.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10<br />
It&#039;s the second anime that can make me laugh soooo hard in every episodes (the first one is SKET Dance). So, there&#039;s no lack for the enjoyment. Perfect score for it.<br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
Well what can I say? It&#039;s so good for the enjoyment, even the other aspects were not too perfect. But it&#039;s still good, right? eh, no, it&#039;s better than good is it?<br />
<br />
If you feel you want to watch series and looking for a grooveless anime so that you are not forcing your brain to think &quot;How will it end?&quot; &quot;What will happen to him/her after that?&quot; or else and you want to laugh because your life&#039;s suck, I recommend D-Frag! for you.

    Hello Everyone, I&#039;m PyraXadon, a blue fire type.  Today on MAL reviews, I will be talking about, probably one of the most interesting and random, but enjoyable animes out there.  Everyone, this is D-fragments!<br />
<br />
Story (7.76/10): The story of D-fragments, or D-frag in its shorter name, is about a second year by the name of Kazama Kenji, who aspires to be a delinquent at his school with his friends Nagayama and Yokoshima, as the Kazama Clan, or whatever they&#039;re called.  They&#039;re not really well known.  It is then that Kenji meets a little girl by the name of Roka, who offers him

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136825">
        to be part of her club, which after some insanity of the over 9000 kind and some running around the school, that Kenji agrees to be part of the club, and the story continues on from there.  <br />
<br />
When you&#039;re looking at an anime that&#039;s based on a club, you normally get the same formula of the characters of the show going to the clubroom and doing whatever, (which is usually nothing), making a couple jokes that are &quot;funny&quot; to us, the audience, then ending the episode off in a sort of episodic form.  Now take that, and reverse it.  That is what D-frag is.<br />
<br />
The story of this series revolves around the antics of the game creation club (provisional), as they go through life at school basically breaking all of the school rules, breaking property, running around and attacking each other with RPG game style attacks, and overall just being as insane as possible.  And that&#039;s only the first episode.  Beyond that, the series doesn&#039;t really go beyond that sort of mindset.  The whole series is essentially the game creation club&#039;s antics, explained in a great multitude of hilarious and VERY entertaining ways in an arcic setup, that actually works.<br />
<br />
The series itself doesn&#039;t try very hard to be entertaining, and it doesn&#039;t need to, because its idea is just so damn absurd, that it is extremely entertaining and very fun to watch.  The series was made to be very funny, and it succeeded in doing so in the end.  Also, the end.  This series has one of the most bullshit and random endings ever, that I laughed out loud because of just how absurd and hilarious it was when I saw it.  <br />
<br />
Overview<br />
+  Absurd and entertaining plot<br />
+  Many wonderful, memorable moments<br />
-   Somewhat arc heavy<br />
<br />
Characters (8.78/10):  Now, the characters.  When you look at D-fragments&#039; picture, the first thing that comes to mind is, harem.  That is not actually the case.  (The manga does have that tag for some reason.)  This series does have a multitude of female characters, but it is in no way, a true harem.  Because, these girls are much more interesting than most harem females you will ever see.<br />
<br />
Kazama Kenji, as the main protagonist is the aforementioned delinquent of this series.  With his spiky hair and rough way of talking, he is undoubtably someone who aspires to be one, which ultimately fails in the end.  Kazama is an interesting male protagonist, in the sense that he really doesn&#039;t care much for what is going on, since he&#039;s just as lost as the audience is in any given situation, but when it comes down to it, he does care for the people and what he does, as he is shown to be helping out a lot in the game creation club&#039;s &quot;quarrels&quot;.  However, in terms of personality and favor from the audience, he is tiny in comparison to the greater majority of characters in this series.  Mostly, he fills up the main role as the main guy, but other than that, I wouldn&#039;t say too much else.  He mostly takes a backseat when it comes to things.  <br />
<br />
Next is the fire/dark aligned underground boss of the school, (I have literally no idea what all of that entails, Roka Shibasaki.  Roka is definitely the main focal point of the show.  From start to finish, she plays a pivotal role in the plot, and is seen to be around Kazama for the majority of the series.  Personally, I have never really seen a character quite like her, due to the fact that she has this fire aligned moe thing, and this scary dark aligned personality that I would like to avoid if all possible.  She likes bagging people, (putting bags over people&#039;s heads), and all sorts of weird things.  I can&#039;t really explain her because she&#039;s just that kind of character that you can&#039;t really explain due to how interestingly weird she is.  <br />
<br />
Chitose Karasuyama is the earth aligned character in the series, as well as the school president.  Personally, I don&#039;t get how she&#039;s the school president due to tyrannical and sadistic she is.  Chitose is one of those characters that will do whatever it takes to complete a goal, while at the expense of someone else&#039;s pain and misery.  What I think makes her a good character and a good fit for this show, is the fact that she has this authority, and thus the means to make the absurd things in this series make sense in terms of how they came to be.  <br />
<br />
Next, my personal favorite, Sakura Mizukami, or, the water type.  (I&#039;m not kidding.  These characters all have some sort of element alignment like freaking pokemon.)  Sakura is the youngest character out of the whole main cast, being only a first year, with an exceptional addiction, to water.  She is always seen carrying a bottle, and even drowns her opponents with bottled water.  She has this sort of child-like demeanor, being very respectful to her her elders, and even calling Kazama her Onii-san.  (She just does it cause she can.)  <br />
<br />
And finally, Takao.  (There&#039;s no last name for this one.)  Takao being the only character not in the game creation club (provisional), is a rather interesting addition to the main cast.  For starters, she is the only character that has her measurements posted on this site, so that sort of gives you an idea of what we&#039;re dealing with here.  Takao is sort of that bystander person that sort of just stands there and watches everything happen.  She doesn&#039;t really add too much to the series as it goes on, but she still plays a good part nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
The side characters of this series outnumber the main cast 1:10.  What adds to this series&#039;s absurdity, is the fact that the series will add a few characters every few episodes or so, followed by a nametag on one of the screen corners, giving you a sort of idea of who this new person is.  While most of the supporting cast get about 10 minutes of screen time each, the supporting cast that actually matter, such as the double masochist duo of Ataru and Hachi, the electric aligned game creation club&#039;s supervisor, the legendary pigtailed 3rd year Tama-chan, Kazama&#039;s sister Noe, and my personal favorite Funabori.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I think that the supporting cast is too big.  (Even Angel Beats had a smaller cast than this series.)  The fact that they add in characters left and right is a bit too absurd even for me, and their use and imprint on the series is as valuable as a dot you draw on your friend&#039;s paper in the upper right hand corner of their paper.  Also, they didn&#039;t explore some of the more important and better known side characters as much as they could&#039;ve, which I think really would&#039;ve added more, since the supporting cast is just as interesting and weird as the main cast.  <br />
<br />
All in all, the cast itself was very well done for the idea they were going for, and I commend the people who made it, to make a series with a mostly female cast, not a bunch of girls who needed a guy to help them with everything.  Cause these girls kick ass.  <br />
<br />
Overview<br />
+  Very well thought out female cast<br />
+  Somewhat original and thought out character personalities<br />
+  Above average male lead<br />
-   WAY too big of a supporting cast<br />
-   Adding characters left and right that didn&#039;t even matter in the end<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (8.31/10 and 8.95/10):  The art is definitely a good highlight of this show, mainly because the art is so bright and vivid, that it looks like it was colored in a highlighter.  The show has two main ways of presenting the characters.  One in a normal format of presenting the characters, and the ever so common chibi format that we see today.<br />
<br />
For the normal artwork, the series has a very detailed look to it, as well as a very nice and light color palette, that works very well to represent how light-hearted and fun this show is.  <br />
<br />
The chibi artwork on the other hand has this more comical sense to it.  The actual color palette is still the same, but the way the characters are drawn is different, representing the characters in a smaller, shorter, and more cute form.  (Mainly, they use this way of making the characters look chibi on Roka.)  At times, the series intertwines these two art styles, that as mentioned before, works very well for what the series is trying to do.  <br />
<br />
The sound I feel is one of the more addicting things of this series.  While the background music for the actual series is mostly average tracks that are mood fillers, the soundtrack for the series really shines in its OST, and ED.  First, the OST.  I cannot explain it.  The OST has some of the most random lyrics, and an ever-changing tune that I can only explain as a song that is worthy of being this anime&#039;s OST track.  The thing is, it&#039;s so random, that it&#039;s so enjoyable.  Hands down, this OST is one of my favorite opening tracks for an anime period, because it&#039;s just so fun to watch and listen to.<br />
<br />
The ED on the other hand is a very happy song that involves singing about a penalty game.  It&#039;s a nice little finisher to the anime, as it still contains that vibrant energy that this series is overfilling with.  <br />
<br />
Overview<br />
+  Aesthetically pleasing look<br />
+  Good integration of both styles of art work<br />
+  Addicting soundtrack<br />
-   There are none.  =w=<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (9.56/10):  When I first discovered D-fragments, I only chose to start with the manga because the manga was already present and ongoing.  I had held off on the anime series because I wanted to get far in reading the series, just so I don&#039;t spoil anything for myself.  That plan didn&#039;t work, cause I finished the anime before finishing the manga.<br />
<br />
What I love about D-fragments is the sheer randomness that works just so well for this series.  The series itself goes over the top and does not care if you go along for the ride or not.  It goes, and continues, making you hope that you can keep up.  As I was watching this series, the most memorable parts about it for me was how much I enjoyed the slapstick comedy that worked extremely well for this series.  For a series that wanted to be random, it succeeded.  D-fragments is one of those series that anyone can enjoy without thinking too hard.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I love this series because of how entertaining and enjoyable it was.  It provided me some great laughs and no facepalmy plot points that I hate with all my heart.  In the end, I would recommend this show to anyone who would like a good laugh, or even to just not think, because in the end, thinking while watching this, will get you nowhere.  It&#039;s not the best thing to watch in the world, but for a comedy/school series, it&#039;s definitely top notch.<br />
<br />
Overall Score: (9.15/10)  Remember.  I&#039;m a blue fire type!

    Welp, first review - I&#039;ll try to keep this short and straight to the point. Hopefully this will be somewhat effective. I&#039;ll try to keep this spoiler-free, so apologies if I sound rather vague.<br />
<br />
Fast-paced and light-hearted, D-Frag! is a surprising comical piece that never failed to amuse. The main characters are lively, humorous, and full of fun retorts. Although it does not have a slice-of-life tag, it practically is one - after all, this anime follows the daily adventures of the members of the (Fake) Game Creation Club. And unlike other slice-of-life anime, most of the episodes are loosely stringed together (although I wouldn&#039;t go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203197">
        as far out to say that there is a coherent plotline).<br />
<br />
However, this anime is still far from perfect. The execution is certainly not perfect - being a fast-paced anime, the viewer is constantly being thrown from scene to scene, almost in a daze. Furthermore, many of the characters&#039; actions are overly exaggerated. Although this is clearly done for a comedic effect, these actions are constantly overused - up to the point where it&#039;s predictable and does not substantially add any meaning to the character or the plot as a whole. Finally, the characters&#039; relationships to each other are not clearly established or ignored for the most part (minus a few exceptions).<br />
<br />
All I can say is that if you&#039;re looking to kill time, this is the anime for you.<br />

    i really enjoyed D-Frag! i thought at first it was weird but as the situations progressed to be more and more ridiculous i found my self hooked on to this anime <br />
=============================================<br />
the story is about kazama kenji a boy in high school who likes to think of himself as a &quot;delinquent&quot; he decides to visit a game club to see if he can &quot;borrow&quot; some manga and games but little did he know he just walked into the &quot;Game Development Club(temp)&quot; a club full of weird girls who think they have different elemental affinities they coerce him into joining their club where many strange happenings

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171415">
        go on.<br />
<br />
overall this anime is hysterical with funny gags and good art this is personally one of my favourite animes and i believe most people would enjoy watching it.

    &quot;We&#039;re a group of geeks with ambition, despair, and angler fish... Just Kidding&quot; D-frag OP<br />
<br />
After watching 12 episodes, this by far is one a hell roller-coaster ride. <br />
<br />
Even though this show doesn&#039;t have any plots or arcs, this show is towards more on Comedy, just like Nichijou and Daily Lives of High school boys. The gags, reactions really made me lol, Fanservice? There is one massive oppai, one flat oppai and the rest are normal. Sadly this series has no beach scene. Well, doesn&#039;t matter anyway, this series is enjoyable. Otherwise, directing and script is well prepared.8/10<br />
<br />
The art is not really interesting, but for a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195423">
        studio that i never heard before, the animations are fluid and smooth, no loopholes or weird animations, They did a good job. Character designs is also nice, the chibi version also. 8/10 <br />
<br />
The OPs and the EDs are enjoyable, listened repeatedly for the OPs full version. The seiyuus that were chosen to voice acting the characters are decent and noticably Hanazawa Kana (Kuroneko from Oreimo) voice acting Roka, which i recognized earlier after the story of the series begin.  Kazama&#039;s seiyuu voice acting is also great, never listen to his other voice acting, but for this i really like it especially on the reaction parts. 8/10<br />
<br />
I like Kazama&#039;s reactions, it&#039;s totally funny and i wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s priceless. He seems to be oblivious to Takao&#039;s feelings. Takao on other hand, can be a tsundere sometimes and i love her reaction when she cries, (so cute). Overall, the characters in this series can be sometimes weird and sometimes fun. 8/10<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed watching this series, this made me laughed so hard that i almost woke everyone up (in my family) because it&#039;s a comedy series. But overall, it&#039;s a good show to watch, release my stress after doing school works. Hopefully this show can get a season 2 because....<br />
<br />
THE HUMOR IS DAMN STRONG, I WANT TO LAUGH MORE.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10

    Loud, funny, predictable at times, but still adorable and satisfying. Despite the close relationship that anime fans have to gaming, it&#039;s rare to see an anime dedicated purely to the subject. However, D-Frag is a show where games and the world of gaming is the basis for a funny and refreshing spin on the school club anime scene.<br />
<br />
The story starts with Kenji, a so-called delinquent, who has recently moved to the city with his friends. They aren’t really bad people; they merely want the mystique that is attached to those sorts of people. Kenji and companys&#039; appearance breathes hope into their club, but however, their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150699">
        recruitment drive is…less than orthodox. It borders on the manic and farcical. The first several minutes give you no preparation for this, and at first, the audience left in stunned silence, but the tension slowly dissipates and you realize that the club is a rag-tag team of eccentrics, obsessives and power-mad horrors. However, there’s a twist in the tale, entailing the prior existence of a Game Dev Club, led by a busty girl named Takao. This extra addition gives a sense of competition and dynamism to the story. It could’ve been completed in the first episode, but the element of peril would’ve been extinguished. Fortunately it lingers on and adds an extra dimension to proceedings.<br />
<br />
Yes, some of the characters can be included into a cookie-cutter-like feeling, incorporating  archetypes such as the dominatrix, the peppy go-getter, the lazy placater, yet each of them possess an extra dimension which saves them from being purely plot vehicles<br />
<br />
As for the rest of it, it sort of falls down. The art work can be good at times and when the comedy is heightened to insane levels, it comes into its stride and it works. Unfortunately, during the bits in between it feels a little flat and dull – like watching a rushed product, or a part where the animators were anxious to get to the more comedic, and interesting parts. It lacks consistency and originality in its artwork, but nevertheless, a good watch. <br />
<br />
I certainly like this show and find it to be very funny. Gaming is something that most anime fans can understand and relate to, so I’m surprised it has not been explored more often. It&#039;s a refreshing addition to the school club genre and I certainly recommend this show for people seeking a wacky comedy with a lot of slapstick and shouting. <br />

    Overall, I have to give this anime a seven, although at times i wanted to give it a 6 and other times a 8.<br />
<br />
Comedy wise, this is is pure gold!!!! I laughed quite a few times during every episode!!! Kenji really keeps it real and I love how he shouts at almost everything XD Without kenji, this anime would suck ass. imagine putting like densuke from eiken or any weakling anime main character and it would be a total embarrassment. The supporting characters are hit or miss, and I really blame this for only being 12 episodes! It felt a little compressed, and thus some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172981">
        characters got forgotten or didn&#039;t really have their stories/personalities explored that well.  The jokes are pretty original, even when it comes to the ecchi stuff with takao&#039;s oppai;however, I kinda hated takao after awhile, she&#039;s just an excuse to put big boobs in anime. she would be a horrible character if she didn&#039;t have boobs, that&#039;s how sadly the writers made her lol. they basically made her a running boob joke. that can tick people off, and even though im a boob lover, they went a little too much with that joke. Thankfully, Roka is there to save the day :P such a cutie pie! Such a stranger character, but rightfully done! I don&#039;t feel like discussing every character, becuz they&#039;re hit or miss, but almost all deliver laughs, and that was the goal.<br />
<br />
Plot: well there&#039;s minimal plot because that&#039;s the point lol! that what makes it funny, so don&#039;t go expecting a deep work of art.<br />
<br />
Sound: there&#039;s not much to say about this, just avg.<br />
<br />
Art: again, pretty typical anime<br />
<br />
I finished this anime in one day, man it gave me a great happiness and i wish they went for like 22-24 episodes total. Plus, it won&#039;t have a long-term effect on ya, you&#039;ll forget about this anime as it has really no plot and is just there to make you laugh. still happy that i watched it though. <br />
<br />

    This anime has a great sense of humor. Often it&#039;s over the top and goofy but that&#039;s part of the charm. A lot of the gags are very well written.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much of a plot to this anime, so don&#039;t watch it if you&#039;re looking for story progression. It&#039;s more or less episodic, but the writing is so unpredictable that it doesn&#039;t matter. It&#039;s hectic and it keeps you interested for the entire episode.<br />
<br />
The artwork is plain but functional. The music and sound isn&#039;t anything exceptional but it&#039;s well done and that&#039;s all that really matters.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is outstanding, especially for Kenji.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a sprinkling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308680">
        of love triangle romance plot in this anime but it takes a backseat to the comedy, and thankfully so. This show is weighted towards humor and a serious love triangle wouldn&#039;t work at all.  Not to mention it&#039;s hard to take Roka seriously as a love interest.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a wild, nonsensical comedy then I definitely recommend this anime.

    D-Frag, the most unexpected anime of the season. Turns out it was a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
This has a very simple story, a comedy about a wannabe delinquent who joins a club of the craziest women ever. But, the comedy is just golden. Truth be told, I started watching it because I felt that Seitokai S2 was pretty lackluster, and this anime didn&#039;t let me down, not one week. Although it&#039;s weakest episodes are probably the first two, which may not be the best to promote the series.<br />
<br />
Each and every one of the character probably made you laugh AT LEAST once, they were all fantastic and so random,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136931">
        yeah, that&#039;s the word I&#039;m looking for: Random.<br />
<br />
I mean, we have a teacher called Shaun Konekone with a crystal skull. We have a son and a father that appear for no reason at all and they are great too, we have the cutest character Funnabori, the best tsundere Takao, the mysteriously hilarious and cute Roka (voiced by HanaKana), the student council president  who looks like Hitagi and is voiced by the same person who voiced her in Monogatari. We have a masochist voiced by FukuJun (Lelouch and Yuuta).<br />
<br />
I SEROIUSLY recommend this to anyone, a masterpiece hands down. The reason why it&#039;s so good is probably because it has progress, both with the characters and the story. Something Seitokai lacks, unfortunately. Off course, if you don&#039;t find the &quot;random wtf&quot; jokes funny, this isn&#039;t for you. But you&#039;ll most likely still enjoy it, you may not laugh as much, but it&#039;s still an enjoyable ride
