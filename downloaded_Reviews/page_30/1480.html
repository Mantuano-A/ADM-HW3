It always left me anxious, nauseous, frustrated, and sometimes all of the above. If you want to draw meaning from suffering, it needs to be natural and purposeful. The Journey of Elaina manufactures pain to give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368406">
        the audience catharsis, but there is never a satisfying conclusion to relieve the pent up emotions it conjures. At the end of each chapter, we&#039;re gifted dubious life lessons from the self-absorbed main character. She should figure out her emotional deficiencies before waxing philosophical like she&#039;s Aristotle. <br />
<br />
In the first episode, Elaina studies to become a witch. She passes the sorcery exam at 14 years old, then seeks to become a witch&#039;s apprentice. After being rejected by the witches nearby, her parents send her to Fran. A secluded witch. Elaina is a very vain person. She obnoxiously praises herself at least once an episode. Her arrogant monologues go like this, &quot;Who is the beautiful girl wearing a brooch that signals her status as a witch, whose ashen hair flutters in the wind, shining so much with beauty and talent that even the sun&#039;s eyes squint involuntarily? That&#039;s right, it&#039;s me.&quot;<br />
<br />
What a humble person. The way she talks about herself borders on narcissism. You&#039;re a child prodigy. We get it. Outside maybe the first episode, I have no reason to believe Elaina is as wonderful as she pretends to be. Her motivations are money, free food, a place to stay, and being praised for her beauty. She travels for the sake of traveling, there&#039;s no depth to her. It&#039;s clear right away that she should be the main selling point of the series. She&#039;ll make or break the show for you. <br />
<br />
I tried to like Elaina at first, she is an interesting person to analyze. Make no mistake, she has next to no character development and no growth whatsoever; however, her cruel actions and lack of empathy are confounding. I always wondered what her endgame would be. Would she finally have a character arc? Or would the entire show be a series of disjointed stories? (It was the latter) It&#039;s hard to feel any empathy towards Elaina when she&#039;s so arrogant, and her travels are either silly or comically morbid. Among her exploits is a visit to a place where slavery is legal, a town of strange people obsessed with dolls, and a bandit infested village that hunts witches.  <br />
<br />
In the very beginning, she talks about her life as a child, reading a book about a traveling witch. She dreamed of being her. And that&#039;s it. The fictional witch&#039;s adventures were probably more exciting than what we got. The only memorable stories are the ones with gratuitous gore and depressing premises. On multiple occasions, children are beaten and bloody. One of them stands, and calmly tells us how her parents abused her. For what? They aren&#039;t trying to portray mental illness realistically. I wish, but it instead devolves into dumb laugh-inducing shock horror. The author is incapable of writing serious dialogue. He barely has a grip on his story&#039;s tone. His ineptitude caused the trainwreck that is episode 9. Watching it was like witnessing someone get shot—you can&#039;t look away. I felt corrupted, violated, by such a morally bankrupt display of self-masturbatory edgy writing. How on Earth could anyone think this is deep?<br />
<br />
Often the show tries to be something it&#039;s not. I don&#039;t feel the world is an exciting place to explore, partly because there&#039;s almost no world-building. The only aspect which connects every chapter is cynicism. Seemingly everyone in this world is evil. In this show, people are either thieves, liars, swindlers, child abusers, or murderers. Even the kindest character, Saya, comes uncomfortably close to being a &quot;psychotic lesbian&quot; because she persistently loves Elaina. It&#039;s like the author grew up getting bullied, lied to, cheated on, then fired from their job, so they decided to write a book about how much people suck. And I agree with you; people do suck, but if you want to tell a story about it, make it purposeful. When a series about adventuring doesn&#039;t make me want to go on an adventure, it&#039;s troubling. <br />
<br />
Frequently, this anime gets compared to Kino&#039;s Journey. I thought Kino&#039;s remake was ok, but the original (from what I&#039;ve seen and read) is fantastic. I see the similarities. The Journey of Elaina reminds me of Kino because each setting explores flaws and morality in society. Such as if liars or murder are should be illegal/legal. Or what would happen if slavery was legal. They&#039;re not quite the same. Elaina&#039;s themes are more superficial and sometimes preachy, but they&#039;re told through complicated metaphors and wordy dialogue. <br />
<br />
In contrast, Kino gives us information without much talking and filters through a bias due to Kino&#039;s moral compass. Kino allows us to draw conclusions ourselves. Kino empathizes with the people they encounter. If they see someone suffering, they will help. Although they don&#039;t sacrifice their life, they do put themself in danger for others/to stay true to their moral compass. But Elaina doesn&#039;t have much of a moral compass. She only intervenes if she has something to gain, like money, a free meal, or a place to stay. If her beauty is insulted, she retaliates. Her motives are less relatable or admirable, in my eyes, at least. I think some of these issues were due to a poor adaptation—I haven&#039;t read the light novel, so I can&#039;t say that for sure. You directly access the characters&#039; thoughts in a light novel, and the author can easily exposit information. The anime may have struggled to get that information on screen. At some point, I&#039;m going to read the light novel, and then I&#039;ll have a better idea of if it&#039;s a problem with the source material or the adaptation itself. Even with the sparse information given on screen, there are worthwhile observations to be made.<br />
<br />
At first, it may seem self-obsessive; women can receive confidence from gazing at themselves in a mirror, ignoring cultural beauty standards or intrusion of the male gaze. Staring at oneself can be a way to take power back, especially in a society that tells women that their external appearance matters. In some cases, society says appearance matters more than anything else. To look in the mirror and love yourself for who you are is healthy, in moderation. This logic applies to men as well. By observing your emotional expressions in a mirror, you condition yourself to be more comfortable. Becoming aware of your own emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and expectations is a necessary first step toward acceptance and self-compassion. Elaina&#039;s self-obsession doesn&#039;t stem from her insecurities or cultural expectations; in fact, she is a prisoner to them. When confronted with other beautiful women, or men who question her beauty, she becomes enraged rather than indifferent. Not only is she self-obsessed, but she also cares too much about what others think of her. Narcissists tend to have overinflated yet fragile egos that easily pop, like a hot air balloon poked by a pen. One could argue that Elaina feels insecure because the witch society hated her, but that falls apart when you realize they rejected her simply because she is special. Supposedly passing the test at only 14 made the other witches &quot;envious&quot; of her, which only inflated her ego more. Elaina has another prominent sign of narcissism—a lack of empathy. <br />
<br />
On her journey, when Elaina briefly stops at a town, she avoids becoming connected with anyone or anything. She has a non-interference rule—influenced by her mother&#039;s guidance. Even if someone is suffering, she won&#039;t bother. It&#039;s not because she lacks the strength to help. Her magic is powerful, and she&#039;s rarely in danger. To rationalize abandoning people in need, Elaina says, &quot;Just because you are doing something for someone else doesn&#039;t make it right.&quot; If this sounds like a shitty excuse, I agree. If someone is dying on the side of the road, do you call an ambulance or drive away? You&#039;d help, of course. But she wouldn&#039;t. Elaina just cops out and says &quot;not helping was the right thing.&quot; At least Elaina acknowledges she&#039;s preachy, but that doesn&#039;t stop her from being a jerk. As she flys away, she ponders her actions. Then pushes the thoughts out of her mind and continues onward. Nothing lost, nothing gained. <br />
<br />
If that&#039;s something you want, feel free to watch this. The art, animation, and music are great. It&#039;s one of the best-looking anime of the season. If nothing else, watch it for the aesthetic. Although most of it is fluffy slice-of-life and silly short stories, it is always cynical. If you don&#039;t like morbidity and negativity in your fiction, I understand if you&#039;d opt for something else. Nowadays, if I want to remember that the world sucks, I&#039;ll just turn on the news.

    &quot;Happiness is a way of travel, not a destination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fiction often tells us a similar tale: one of the hero saving the day, where happiness is a commodity given as a reward for good and just deeds. In the case of Majo no Tabitabi, which follows Elaina&#039;s solitary journey throughout the vast skies and endless seas, this rule of fiction is approached in a more skeptical manner. Good intentions may be rewarded, but it is not always so. <br />
<br />
Unlike most anime, Majo no Tabitabi doesn&#039;t portray karma as an infallible law from which we can never escape. Sometimes the characters will strive to resolve an issue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368404">
        with good intentions, but as a consequence of following their heart, it can sometimes lead not to a problem being fixed, but a problem made worse. These themes can potentially be misconstrued by some viewers as the story being pretentious (among other disparaging terms), but Majo no Tabitabi does not claim that optimism or idealism is wrong, either. Karma and morality are treated as an open-ended question of which there is no inherently correct answer. It is situational and oftentimes a matter of luck, which is demonstrated by the various happy and unhappy conclusions to the episodes.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s precisely this unpredictable pattern of storytelling which makes Majo no Tabitabi so enchanting. There are happy episodes that warm the soul, more slice-of-life in nature and which will make the viewer laugh and smile. There are darker episodes, which are less frequent, but which make you question the characters&#039; actions as well as your own beliefs. And even in the quieter moments, where the story is meant to be approached more as entertainment, there are subtle themes that can be pursued by the viewer at their behest. What happens when a wall is erected in the middle of a small town, for example? While these themes are nothing exemplary on their own, they do complement the story on a wider scale by showing facets of Elaina&#039;s personality which are not otherwise explored in the more serious episodes. It is, after all, as much a story about Elaina herself as it is about the adventure. Travel is personal, and is inherently a story about the traveler. <br />
<br />
Most likely, there will be some people who disagree with aspects of Elaina&#039;s worldview. And that is fine, as she is an observer and fervently avoids the role of hero. Unlike most anime protagonists, while Elaina is naturally a kind person, she will sometimes ignore the plights of others if it is not of personal benefit or interest to her. There are of course times where she will help the strangers of a country on a more selfless basis, but by and large, she calculates whether or not it is worth getting involved in a problem, just as the vast majority of people in our world do. After several years travelling from place to place, being embroiled in local issues that do not affect her personally, it is inevitable that at least some of her good intentions would have led to tragedy and less-than-happy outcomes. And so Elaina knows, and so she does not assume the helping hand will be met with a just reward. There is a big difference between someone like Elaina, who is experienced and hardened, and an anime character who is cynical and morally grey simply because it is perceived as cool to be so. I would even go as far as to say this is what separates Majo no Tabitabi, a surprisingly adult-oriented anime, apart from series like Oregairu and Re:Zero. Elaina may not possess the same innocence and happy-go-lucky nature as other characters in anime, but that is because she has traveled far and seen the world at large, and has thus not had the luxury of being trapped in a small social bubble, as so many are.<br />
<br />
That is not to claim that Majo no Tabitabi&#039;s storytelling is without error, because it is not. There are a few aspects that I wish were better, particularly the conclusion of the 9th episode, which was excessive in a way the show hadn&#039;t really been up to that point. It&#039;s possible the anime staff tried to capture part of that Re:Zero audience, which, for a product seeking financial success, is unfortunate but expected. The themes and the plot of the episode were engaging and shocking in the right ways, but the visual direction had me almost feel as though I were watching a different anime entirely. But it is not as though the serious episodes all follow this same formulae, so the odd directorial shift for the one episode was given little more than a shrug from me. <br />
<br />
Another issue some might find is that the pacing, particularly at the start, is lightning fast. Hearing &quot;And so, six months later...&quot; doesn&#039;t really allow the viewer to get all too attached to the events of the episode. I do appreciate that the story covers a large span of time (essentially 4+ years, and likely more in the light novels), and I even prefer this over more traditional slice-of-life, but trimming the timeskips down a tad would help to make the passage of time feel more natural and less abrupt. The presence of yuri elements towards the end - a frequent trope in slice-of-life series with predominantly female casts - was also a bit on the unnecessary side. That said, it is not pervasive, and is largely relegated to a single episode, which is fortunate as the series&#039; strengths are not in romance and sudden... homoerotic proposals. <br />
<br />
On a more technical level, Majo no Tabitabi is solid. While the animation is not something that will explode your mind and make you feel as if you were watching some massive-budget production, there is more effort here than the typical static visuals of most anime. In a lot of anime, it is essentially just a slideshow - panning over a single image for five or more seconds, with the only moving parts being the flapping of a character&#039;s lips. Majo no Tabitabi may occasionally fall victim to this shortcutting as well— there are weekly deadlines to be met, after all— but there is often more going on than the average anime, even if it is something as subtle as Elaina shrugging her shoulders while speaking. As well, the art style of Majo no Tabitabi is vibrant and lively, and the characters&#039; facial expressions convey considerable emotion. They do not need to explicitly say &#039;I am angry&#039; or &#039;I am sad&#039; for you to understand what they are thinking and feeling. This may sound obvious, and something to be expected, but the sad truth is that most TV anime forget the importance of facial expressions and instead rely on voice acting talent to illustrate a scene. Majo no Tabitabi may be simple, but it excels in said simplicity. <br />
<br />
It is also admirable how the anime staff honoured the creator&#039;s wishes to keep the anime adaptation free of sexual fanservice. I don&#039;t have any issues with sexual content in anime, and— to the contrary— view it as a positive when handled well. But moments involving pantyshots and things of that nature are juvenile and would do nothing but detract from Elaina&#039;s character. She is mentally and emotionally mature in a way that most female characters in anime aren&#039;t, and seeing her get embarrassed because she was caught changing clothes— or whatever else ecchi anime do these days— would diminish who she is as a person. The anime is confident enough in its own qualities that it does not need to add gratuitous sexual fluff. Leave that to the doujins and fan material, and keep letting Majo no Tabitabi be as it is, I say. <br />
<br />
So, yeah. I liked Majo no Tabitabi. Quite a bit, too. A lot of people have drawn parallels between it and Kino no Tabi, and I would say that is quite appropriate. But where Kino no Tabi excelled in worldbuilding, I sometimes thought it fell short with regards to characterization. Majo no Tabitabi is the answer to that issue. While it may be more divisive than other anime of its genre, it comes as a solid recommendation to all varieties of anime fans. Anime like this are exceptionally, and increasingly rare in today&#039;s marketplace. If you haven&#039;t watched it yet, you&#039;re missing out on something special. <br />
<br />
And if you&#039;re curious, I&#039;ll even go a step further: I think Majo no Tabitabi is the best anime of the year - and potentially more.

    Once upon a .. .&#039; Stop! That&#039;s too corny. <br />
How about &#039;One Saturday afternoon&#039;? That&#039;s slightly better, <br />
but why not begin more directly, like saying Who is the beautiful girl wearing a Brooch? That’s right it’s me. OK, now we&#039;re off<br />
<br />
Majo No Tabitabi or Wandering Witch is a story that almost tells itself in its title. It is not so hard to imagine what kind of anime this will going to be; a fairy tale stories about young prodigy witch, traveling from country to country, meets new people and new situations in every episode. The anime is exactly as you&#039;d expect, and more, but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368401">
        is also not a daydreams fairy tales as you’d expect.<br />
<br />
The anime is episodic in nature and a lot of people compare this to Kino’s Journey which is understandably so and I won’t deny there’s a case of similarity, but there’s difference I firmly belief in the way Majo no Tabitabi’s handled its narratives. First of all, though each of Majo No Tabitabi episode is technically developed with a self-contained story, there’s gradual sense of lore, secrets and worldbuilding that is built to complement one-overarching setting. Have you noticed a trend of adventure anime not being about adventure at all? (Isekai is the one most guilty of this) most of the time they are obsessed with explaining and expositing all the mechanics and systems of a world (which get defused in the most boring way possible).  One of the most relevant feature of narrative, I believe, is the fact that the whole tends to make sense of the parts. It is often only at the end of a story that the elements leading up to the ending make sense, but it&#039;s not just the outcome that matters - &#039;the whole&#039; also include the backgrounds context. In this respect Majo No Tabitabi never tried to bombarding its audiences with lots of exposition about how the magic works etc, but just lets its stories built its backgrounds.<br />
<br />
Regarding the country/states that Elaina visits, this is also one of the case of differences from the show with Kino’s Journey. While Kino’s Journey trying to showing the beauty of its world in the darkest and grim way possible, in this anime not every country that Elaina visits has this dark storyline behinds it and at times it just a peaceful and sweets country. Which means there’s variation of mood and themes coming in each episode; some episodes perhaps a bit uncomfortable to watch, some are thought-provoking, and others just downright comical at times. I personally find this quite a mixed bag as I found some episodes were good, some episodes weren’t, as every episodic anime out there, but this was really prominent here because the different tones presented in each episode, making me wonder sometimes about the show needed to make up its mind about what it wanted to be. That said some viewers may found this interesting as they will be presented with something different each episode.   <br />
<br />
Due the limitation of episodic nature of the anime, there’s little possibilities to develop story and characters beyond the main ones, but to its credit, the show manages to deliver in this department which is not the cases of some episodic series. Elaina, as the main character of the story, is obviously an interesting case, she is one of the more unusual characters concepted within the entirety of anime. A prodigy that managed to become a full pledged witch in very young age, travelling from country to country while riding her magic broom and dreaming of travel all over the world following the footstep of her childhood hero and always explicitly saying to herself how she is the beautiful person in the universe. She is hardly an archetypal hero nor is she concepted to become one. Her characterization is based on the books she reads, her knowledge of tragical story/country, her experiences in this journey and the fact she’s self-aware that she’s a special talent. As a result, I found it quite justifiable that some of her action and sometimes conclusion of the episodes in this anime were not ended in the most idealistic way possible. But to balance the books there are also some episodes where things are not going in her way and she’s feels helpless to the point it was just a very bad experience to her. All of this kind of stuff is what, to many, makes the characters and the show memorable.  <br />
<br />
Despite all that things said above, the prominent sides characters were actually not bad. I just like the fact that these sides characters were not just appeared in one episode and just go away like every other episodic series as I thought that it would be, given the fact this shows change its setting regularly. Most characters of importance are all females witch (there’s no male, even though they do exist) who exist in pleasant companionship, though, of course, they all have quite distinct personalities that blend well together even if these are somewhat clichéd: from Saya, Elaina’s acquaintance who’s madly feel in love with her (this is why this show could be uncomfortable, especially ep 11 I think) and the initially brooding yet kind-hearted Sheila to the insightful teacher in Fran. Most of the characters are also given a personal quirk, which is something of a cheap shot yet works remarkably well to give them personality.<br />
<br />
However, the show certainly has its fair share of flaws. For starters, some of the townspeople here most of the time behaving not like actual, realistic people. I’m not saying they should be characters with lots of complexity but sometimes they are just there to giving a suspension of disbelief. There are some episodes involving dolls where the townspeople were just braindead citizens and some episodes where there’s issue that plague the country for years and Elaina who solved it in an instant doing it in the simplest way possible and none of the citizen were even though about it. There’s also a bit issue regarding the rewatchability of this show, particularly on the ‘dark’ episodes; it relies far too much on shock factor to create drama and even some of them were pretty predictable at times. Given the fact that every stories solved in one episode, the suspense and the built up for this kind of story is kind of weak and as a result I believe there’s not much left to be chew on the second viewing.<br />
<br />
As for the art, it isn’t the anime strongest point. Studio C2C is not the prolific studio out there and this kinda shown here. While Characters are easily distinguished graphically and are able to express a wide range of emotions, There’s actually not much to look at. Scenes are composed rather straightforwardly, and I found the whole thing visually dull. There are some scenes with witches chasing around and the show just showed us with still frames. The anime doesn’t really do a far superior job in leveraging its visuals to convey feeling, emotion, and subtext. The setting is always looking great, but rarely do the visuals add significantly to or help further our understanding of our heroine’s journey. And more importantly it just lacks atmosphere that you kind of expect from such a show. <br />
<br />
The music, too, was not so memorable; I like the OP song which you should hear it too even though you don’t watch the anime but not so much about the ED. As for the soundtrack, it&#039;s about as standard folk fair as it comes, but it fits the setting, accompanying especially the more festive moments perfectly and has the good graces to sometimes simply not be very good.<br />
<br />
For all the above technical qualities, though, the show manages to be above average in any way in its stories and characters. I do believe as most anime, the show still has issues mainly the good old ‘some episodes were good and some episodes were not’ that you always found in episodic series. Looking at Majo no Tabitabi as the Kino’s Journey is quite mistaking. What comes first in this show is the protagonist, that is, Elaina herself and not so much about the setting but at the same time it is not as much random setting that just there for the landscape, there’s backgrounds context built behind it. In many ways, the travels of the protagonists are but a means to show her growth as a living person and a small piece of breathing world. If they do a sequel and I’m still around, then sure, I’ll keep following the series.<br />

    The world isn&#039;t beautiful, therefore it is.”<br />
― Keiichi Sigsawa<br />
<br />
Majo no Tabitabi was not only one of the most pleasant surprises for me in 2020, but perhaps one of the best anime series to come out of 2020. <br />
<br />
Adapted from a light novel series written by Jougi Shiraishi, directed by Toshiyuki Kubooka (who had also previously directed the Berserk film trilogy), and produced by C2C, a studio not known for a huge resume outside of their contribution to WorldEnd (commonly referred to as SukaSuka), Majo no Tabitabi would seem like your typical run-of-the-mill, cutesy, lighthearted fantasy series with a prominent and colorful witch-themed setting. With such

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368395">
        an inviting outward appeal, it’s a good way to attract a much larger demographic of anime fans and viewers alike. <br />
<br />
However, on the flip side, Majo no Tabitabi is also NOT your typical wholesome witch-themed fantasy series, and not a show that one should not watch on a whim without a legit incentive and willingness to understand and acknowledge what is presented before them. Considering the situation regarding the huge majority of fantasy anime series nowadays, it’s safe to say that Elaina’s entrance into the anime community was a great and refreshing change of pace for a genre that desperately needed something more innovative and atypical. Needless to say, this isn’t just some silly “fantasy fetish fuel” like many naysayers may claim it is after just watching a few episodes.<br />
<br />
Similar to its spiritual predecessor in Kino no Tabi, Majo no Tabitabi is an episodic storytelling collection of short stories, a good number of them being parables (or moral tales). The individual tales are self-contained, and for the most part, do not really focus so much on the main protagonist Elaina herself. Instead, the stories are separately established based off whatever societal or moral theme is presented or emphasized upon, ranging from truth &amp; lies to vengeance to paraphilia to social divisiveness. Depending on what’s in focus, the tone and mood, be it lighthearted, creepy, or tragic, is set into play to properly frame it. Much of the spotlight involves the people within each country or civilization that Elaina visits and her observations of the settings as a traveler, and usually not so much on Elaina herself. Quite often, the stories don’t have a definitive or tangible beginning and end, as she would come in when conflict is at its peak, or when it’s about to start or finish. This kind of contemplative storytelling is quite a throwback and quite unlike the premises of most current <br />
<br />
What makes Majo no Tabitabi quite different from Kino no Tabi, despite being its spiritual successor, is that while the stories are all mostly disjointed and out of order, they don’t really go and immerse that deeply in terms of pure philosophical and societal approaches. Instead, in addition to the settings, they also divert focus to the supporting and/or minor characters and Elaina’s involvement with them and their surroundings. Due to Elaina’s more dynamic characterization and a more lenient balance between worldbuilding and characters, the minor cast members themselves don’t simply come off as merely stiff, rigged caricatures created for the sole sake of setting up each self-contained narrative. They feel like actual genuine characters interacting with the world around them. The adventures are as odd and bizarre as they come due to the constant tonal disparity between each other. Some stories come off as jovial and/or silly in nature, some weird and uncanny, and some stories dark, tragic, and/or emotional. For the most part, even if you’re quite familiar with the source material, you’ll still likely won’t be prepared for what you get with each ensuing episode. This can admittedly put off many viewers who can’t really handle the confusing mood whiplashes. However, the tone shifts can also keep the viewers interested and willing to watch and experience more of the idiosyncratic ventures, as opposed to the mostly monotone atmosphere of Kino no Tabi.<br />
<br />
The story of Majo no Tabitabi also has more recurring motifs, smartly implemented subtleties, and contextual backgrounds, as well as going so far as to establishing and fleshing out the more prominent and recurring characters, whom also include Elaina herself. The ubiquitous presence of the witch motif brings attention and interest to the context of the very hierarchy of witches itself as well as how individual countries perceive witches differently. Due to how peculiar and often seemingly out of place the varying medieval-esque societal views within the world of Elaina can be, this series can’t simply be framed or judged strictly by the current modern-day moral standards and principles whatsoever at any point in time, especially when it comes to Elaina’s own actions (or non-actions at times).<br />
<br />
The animation aesthetics of Majo no Tabitabi are quite impressive and delightfully pleasing with relatively few inconsistencies, even when considering the state of 2020 and the studio and staff handling the series. The delicate usage of softer, less accentuated color palettes and textures, as well as a keen eye for symbolic and metaphorical visual directing, bring a more graceful and natural presentation of the settings, making the landscape look right out of an artbook collection; it’s as if Elaina herself is diving right into the very storybook that inspired her to travel in the first place. What’s also quite notable about the animation is how sharp and amazing it looks during the action scenes; clean and slick usage of special effects and sounds, as well as surprisingly clean 3D implementation, bring a more profound and ethereal impact to the scenes, making them even better looking than most other action scenes in more action-orientated shows.<br />
<br />
The sound and music in Majo no Tabitabi are also very proficient. The more prominent musical tracks are helped along with timely cues to emphasize the more empathic and/or emotional segments, while the simpler and subtle sounds add to the background to further authenticate Elaina’s world, ranging from the magic sounds of her wand or broom to the simple glass noises of her picking up a filled cup of tea. The opening theme, “Literature” by Reina Ueda, personifies the uplifting and surreal sense of adventure and wondering where the next destination will be. The ending theme, “Haiiro no Saga”, brings a mystifying, foreboding, and ambiguous tone, warning of and foreshadowing the more dreary and darker shifts the journey of Elaina will take. The voice acting in the show is also extremely good and does not feel stale or forced. Nearly every dialogue and conversation feels naturally flowing, without excessive awkward silence or pauses. The voice acting also does well in epitomizing and portraying the characters and their personality traits, especially with recurring cast members like Saya and Fran, in addition to Elaina herself.<br />
<br />
The characters in Majo no Tabitabi are likely the strongest and yet most polarizing aspect of the show. Most notably, the most important thing to address here...is Elaina herself. Unlike the countless generic selfless “white knight” fantasy main protagonists whom are basically obligated constantly to play hero due to plot convenience, Elaina has few notable heroic traits other than perhaps her wittiness, outward sense of solitude, and high proficiency in magic compared to most other witches. Her thought processes are more practical in nature than many people might think, as she simply doesn’t want to stick her nose in any trouble and mostly looks out for her own well-being, just like any normal human being. That being said, she is also quite naive as well, as she also simply doesn’t know quite enough about the world around her even with the context of the book that inspired her travels. She also has quite a strong sense of confidence and vanity. Despite the polarizing aspects of her, Elaina is still someone who’s kind and caring of others and genuinely willing to help if requested to do so, or even if just out of her own personal interest or emotions. Not all of her decisions to act or not will necessarily be the correct choices, but while it may seen convoluted, it makes sense when you consider how we as humans in general tend to have inconsistencies in how we think, say, or act on things, some of us more so than others. To add onto that, in some of the instances that she does offer to help, the problem doesn’t get solved, either way; in fact, it may actually worsen or aggravate the issue. When that happens, that strong sense of ego she does have is either shaken or broken, reminding her that despite all the power she can have with magic, it doesn’t solve anything and everything, and in the end, she’s still an ordinary traveler. While it doesn’t happen too often, such episodes like this will add upon her already fleshed-out character composition, and while the narrative is still quite too achronological to point it out as obviously, Elaina does show signs of gradual maturation from these ventures.<br />
<br />
While the highlights of the show do focus quite a lot more on the minor supporting cast, the recurring characters are the most notable in giving more complexity to the overlying foundations of Elaina’s story. Saya is perhaps the most notable and enjoyable example. Fun-loving, energetic, and loving company, she is a practically perfect antithesis to the more laid-back and in Elaina. The two’s dynamics are some of the most enjoyable, flavorful, and amusing aspects of the series, as they literally come together like an epic straightman comedy duo. Fran, being formerly Elaina’s teacher, has a big influence on the latter, as she taught Elaina the meaning of failure and setbacks. Because of this, Elaina is particularly close to her despite having to be constantly on the move during her travels. Her personality is quite comparative to that of Elaina, which would make more sense due to her relationship regarding another recurring character in Sheila, who would unironically be Saya’s teacher, and also has comparable personality traits to her apprentice. To have recurring cast members like this is quite remarkable considering the nature of the show’s disjointed storytelling, which means you can’t simply dive into any episode out of order.<br />
<br />
At no point in time was I ever bored watching Majo no Tabitabi; heck, I even went back and rewatched some of the episodes a few times while it aired. For someone like me who really likes innovative episodic storytelling, this series was something I really sought after for quite a long while. The tone disparity is something that really keeps me interested in whatever new and bizarre venture Elaina gets herself into. Most of the time, it’ll have me laughing or feeling “healed”, and other times, it may have me shook, confused, or even emotional. Elaina’s smug nature and complexity as a non-heroic figure really appealed to me a lot on a personal level alongside her great character design. The soundtracks and animation are so pleasing to experience, which is relieving to be aware of, especially given how rough the year of 2020 has been for the anime industry overall. I also often found myself understanding and pointing out how every episode teaches a moral lesson, either upfront or subtly in whatever way, instead of trying to seem overly philosophical and conceited in a vague manner, which might’ve ruined my enjoyment otherwise. I also found the show relatively easy to comprehend, especially regarding Elaina’s characterization. At no point in time did I find her decisions convoluted or of an apathetic standpoint; in fact, I often found them somewhat relatable and easy to look at in retrospect. It’s a shame that the beauty of this show can often be tainted by the misinterpretations of many viewers.<br />
<br />
While Majo no Tabitabi is honestly a show that not just anybody can watch on a whim, but it’s a series I’d highly recommend to those who are tired of the same old format and tropes of today’s fantasy series and light novel adaptations. With an intricate and immersive sense of storytelling, a more notable incentive for character work, and a very colorful world and settings, it’s probably the antidote for 2020 that we truly needed but probably don’t deserve. It truly is Elaina’s Bizarre Adventure, but hopefully you’ll enjoy it as much as I did.

    Fetish fuel for sadists/bait for edgy teenagers in their “idealism is so cringe, bro” phase.<br />
<br />
Majo no Tabitabi belongs to the “road movie” genre, which is a charitable way of saying “edgy Kino no Tabi’s knockoff with witches,” so I’ll explain what is wrong with this series using another road movie anime title, Mushishi, as an analogy. Imagine a Mushishi episode like this:<br />
The episode begins with Ginko on the road, having an inner monologue about how he is the most talented and successful mushishi in the country. He arrives at a new village, introduces himself as a mushishi, and asks if there are any people around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361108">
        with seemingly-supernatural troubles. He gets directed to a house of a family of four. He examines those people and they express some dire, obviously mushi-related symptoms. Concerned, they ask if he knows what is happening to them. Ginko replies, “Idk, let me sleep on that.” He walks around browsing local attractions for a few hours, eats free dinner, and stays the night at the family’s house. The next morning Ginko wakes up only to discover four corpses that, like, have turned into plants or something. He comments out loud, “Lol, what a bunch of losers,” rummages through cupboards for any food that will keep, packs up his bags, and walks away while whistling a tune. The end. <br />
This is how an average Majo no Tabitabi episode plays out. Stories with villain protagonists are neither rare, nor are they disqualified from being good (see Death Note), but the show has to actually be self-aware that its MC is a piece of shit. Here Elaina spends half the screen time “observing” people trapped in horrible situations that she can easily fix with her magic powers (or worse, situations she created herself), and another half monologuing how smart, cool, and better than anyone else she is - and the show clearly expects the audience to agree that she is a cool badass. What’s really fucking disgusting is that the story deliberately masks itself as a wholesome, family-friendly didactic tale. There was a widely circulated news story about the original author demanding that the adaptation does not feature any panty shots - only for the story itself to feature sexual slavery that the protagonist shrugs with “aw, how sad… well, I’m not the police, ‘kay, bye!” That’s family-friendly, all right. Hey kids, remember to eat your vegetables and not trouble yourself with the problems of some pathetic losers.<br />
<br />
But never mind that, even if all this moral bankruptcy was not present, I’d still rate this show 2/10. Because its writing is absolute trash. Unnatural robotic dialogues, contrived developments, plotlines that abruptly end seemingly 80% into them, nonsensical world building, pointless shock value, non-existent narrative, etc. Here’s an example from the first two minutes of the show: we get the “MC is asking all around town for something and gets every door shut in their face” cliche. Specifically, Elaina is looking for a witch to become her mentor and everyone is turning her away because she’s the youngest ever apprentice to graduate, and they’re all jealous of her talent… which is idiotic and shows a complete lack of understanding on the writer’s part. Smashing the door in someone’s face is an act of outrage/reprehension. It happens when the character in question does something pathetic and unreasonable that no one would ever consider acceptable behavior. Like when Laurence in Spice and Wolf goes begging his fellow traders for a loan after a failed investment. The point is to show the character at their lowest, desperate and grasping at straws. Everyone universally looking down on the once-in-a-century prodigy makes no fucking sense. Most people would be delighted to get a chance to mentor a rising star - if for no other reason than they might become a big deal in the future and it’s profitable to have a connection with important people. Even if there is a person so petty and envious that the existence of a prodigy is a personal insult to them, they’ll still put on a fake smile and turn the prodigy down politely - again, because there is no point in mindlessly antagonizing someone who is going places.<br />
<br />
This brings us back to the first half of this review - if the writer is such a clueless moron that they can’t even use a basic done-to-death cliche right, it’s not that surprising that their attempt to create a sassy smartass would end up as an insufferable psychopath. I’ve being name-dropping all these titles for comparisons, but the one show Majo no Tabitabi is the most similar to is actually Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 - both are stories made by incompetent hacks utterly unqualified for the job, who did it anyway because they just had to tell an all-important message that it’s ok to be a human garbage because the humanity as a whole is garbage anyway.<br />
<br />
1/10 for a pathetic failure of a story.<br />

    Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina <br />
<br />
This is one of the shows I have bookmarked for this year. It is so sweet I do have a glucose monitor to use if I start to feel wonky. <br />
<br />
Storyline: This story follows a cheeky, young witch named Elaina as she sets off on a fantastical journey across the world after being inspired by her favorite book. As with any classic fantasy tale, she’ll meet plenty of folks along the way, from the strange to the bizarre, including giants, townsfolk and even other witches! As she explores the world, her views on her own journey will take shape!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361131">
        <br />
<br />
All of these elements –plus the efforts of numerous unnamed staff members and workers– make for a seriously beautiful start to a series that feels as cozy as a cup of tea. <br />
<br />
But why is Wandering Witch so darn good? Well, let me answer that! <br />
<br />
The foundation for Wandering Witch is good on its own: the story is engaging, the magic mystical and interesting, and the characters completely likable. However, the animation for this series is downright beautiful and took my breath away. <br />
<br />
Beautiful art can come in a lot of forms, and much like video games, good art doesn’t equal a good story, and vice versa. Thankfully, Wandering Witch’s story matches the animation style beat for beat, providing a gorgeous canvas to tell this really earnest story on. Words really can’t express how lovely Wandering Witch is to just simply look at. Everything feels like it should be in a nice artbook collection. <br />
<br />
Whether Elaina’s just in the city or at Fran’s treehouse home, the art is always on point. During action sequences –or even when Elaina takes off on her broom– the animation gets sharp, blending the base art style with slick magic effects that have genuine impact. <br />
<br />
However, Elaina’s animation isn’t the only beautiful thing in the series: the music is just as lovely, with cues handled expertly, especially in highly emotional scenes. As stated before, music is handled by AstroNoteS, who’s previous anime-related credits include High School DxD Hero’s theme song “Switch.” AstroNoteS shines here with lilting music choices that immerse the viewers in a fantastical world. I hope that’s a name we’ll see more of in the near future. <br />
<br />
satisfying magic sounds into Fran and Elaina’s duel. Everything fits the world quite well: even small, simple sounds tucked into the background flavor the world and really make Wandering Witch a sonically delightful watch. <br />
<br />
Elaina finally becomes recognized as a full-fledge Witch, and receives the name &quot;the Ashen Witch&quot;.<br />
What more can be said about such a powerful premier? Every element of Wandering Witch is enjoyable, from the stunning animation to the beautiful music and the genuinely likable characters. With a strong premier that definitely promises a powerful series, Wandering Witch is the easiest recommendation ever. <br />
<br />
Fans of Kino’s Journey –both the original series and the recent new animation- will find that same coziness as Elaina takes to the skies and catalogues her travels as the Ashen Witch. Additionally, light novel readers will be happy to find that the world has –thus far– translated quite well, and feels just as lush as it can in the books. <br />
<br />
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina is already a strong contender for Show of the Season. Safe to say I’ll be induldging in Elaina’s magical world. <br />
<br />
Great story, art, sound and character.<br />
It is the work of our lifetime.<br />
Don&#039;t miss it.<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m honestly in love with this show, while sure it isn&#039;t perfect, but it&#039;s certainly one to watch for this season, and here is why!<br />
<br />
This honestly reminds me of Kino&#039;s journey. It&#039;s a fun show with it&#039;s premise. Making each and every episode different and unique in it&#039;s own way. Which I honestly think is brilliant. It not only allows you to explore the world in more details, but also add an element of surprise each and every week so far. With it&#039;s story following our witch protagonist, as she goes from location to location, engaging in different kinds of story. It&#039;s really fun and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361093">
        imaginative. With the stories having a mix of emotions all through out.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves? All seem realistic and each have a different kind of appeal to them. Which is great to see, always good to have a wide range of personalities to keep a show fresh and engaging to the viewer. Particularly our MC, with having more than one layer to her personality, which adds more to her character. Which can only be a good thing.<br />
<br />
The art and sound is always great, it&#039;s always interesting to see what new environments come about. Really is. You can&#039;t go wrong here, even the magic our MC uses itself is good looking, along with any kind of action scenes in general, it&#039;s really good stuff, and goes along with every scene within the show. While the song is very fitting to each scene. <br />
<br />
The way the characters move is also very great, as their movements never look off, or bad at all. It&#039;s really good stuff all round. They really did a good job at not only the details, but making sure it all flows smoothly. <br />

Should you watch this? Yes, it&#039;s a very good show and certainly one of my stand outs of the season so far, which is very much keeping my interest week in and week out. So you should watch it too!

    A journey always begins with the very first step and that’s truer than ever for a young girl named Elaina. With a fantasy setting built by the creative mind of Jougi Shirashi, we are treated one of the must-see shows of this year.<br />
<br />
Despite the light novel popularity, we didn’t get an anime adaptation airing until 2020. What’s slightly more concerning is that the anime itself is contained within a 1-cour of 12 episodes, and it raises the question if it’s enough to show its true colors. Thankfully, I can say with easy confidence that Majo no Taitabi (Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina) does indeed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368397">
        meet its expectations. This is more than just a fantasy adventure but explores the character journey of a human being.<br />
<br />
Watching Majo no Taibtai feels like watching a child growing up, with every day being a new experience. This idea applies directly to Elaina, a young girl who became a witch. She has the heart of an adventurer, the ambition to succeed, and a thirst to prove herself to the world. From the very first episode, she wants to show the world what she’s learned starting with her mentor, Flan. Unfortunately, it also exposes some of her vulnerability as a witch and that she has a lot to learn than meets the eye. That’s where her journey begins. Elaina embarks on personal journey to learn about the world and discover what’s hidden from horizons beyond.<br />
<br />
As an episodic adventure, the storytelling usually has a self-contained story but always follows how Elaina meets people or dealing with whatever problem she comes across during her journey. Early on, she encounters Saya, and after helping her, they become friends and seemingly forges an important friendship. It goes to show that Elaina herself is both someone easy to get along with and is a selfless person. She puts others’ needs above herself and is never afraid to take risks to help others. This also leads her into dangerous circumstances where her own life is at stake and she must resort to using what she’s learned to survive. From her journey, Elaina also discovers some of the darker truths of the world. This includes her stay in The Land of Truth Tellers or dealing with a princess with lost memories. From the hidden truths, it reveals that underneath the lighthearted magic adventure, there’s a deeper darkness. Elaina never becomes a victim herself but that doesn’t make other characters an easy prey for sin. One of the most prominent example is during episode 9 when she finds out the dark past of a girl named Estelle. I won’t go into spoilers but from this episode alone, it’s shown that some characters are really beyond redemption.<br />
<br />
With each passing episode, we learn not just about Elaina’s adventure story but also about Elaina herself. She has a lot of potential as a witch but sometimes, she isn’t able to fully solve the problem of others. In fact, this anime can be depressing with episodes of despair. In other words, don’t go into the show expecting every episode has a happy ending. Some of them ends up with tragedy and even Elaina herself shows moments of despair. She is still a sensitive girl that is vulnerable to deep emotions. But through meeting new people, she improve herself both mentally and physically. Thankfully, the anime isn’t shy on displaying the character personalities and chemistry of the cast. Two of the most noticeable pairs are Elaina/Saya and Elaina/Fran. One of them is based on mutual friendship as their fellow witches. The other is based on a student and mentor relationship as Elaina wants to prove herself. One other noticeable character by the name of Shelia also appears later in the show. Her personality is mostly characterized being an antithesis of Fran. The anime seized the opportunity to show their past and present relationship, and by the end of this series, they became close friends. In fact, I would say with confidence that friendship is an important theme of the show. It’s through friendship that people can understand each other and resolve problems without just resorting to the magic arts.<br />
<br />
Majo no Taibitai is both a light and dark show, meaning that where there’s light comedy and humor, there’s darkness and despair. The comedy mostly comes from the character personalities of the main cast while the darker elements are hidden within the self-contained stories. However, I will say that overall entertainment value still revolves around Elaina’s journey. She carries this show with each episode that has us, the audience, wondering what’s ahead. Will she live up to our expectations or is her journey one that has serves with little purpose? It’s an ambiguous question because it depends on how you approach the show. Despite the storytelling showcasing episodic adventures, they each have recurring elements that ties the overall anime together. When you’ve seen what this anime for what it really is, then there’s a great chance you’ll want more than just 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Studio C2C managed to do excellent work when it comes animating the setting and overall world fiction of the show. From day one, I noticed that every character is distinctive in some way or form. Elaina has the classic look of a young witch complete with a hat, silver hair, and youthful appearance. Similarly, other characters such as Fran and Shelia has their look as more experienced witches. However, the biggest perk of the show is the overall world building. Almost every episode depicts a new setting as Elaina travels from place to place. It sort of feels like playing a JRPG with a character going into towns and resolving new problems. Only here, we follow Elaina on her adventure as we watch her. The different settings are also saturated with colorful content such as the Land of Mages and magical Kingdoms. Without a doubt, Majo no Taibitai convinced me that Elaina’s journey knew what it was doing when it sells its visual storyteller. <br />
<br />
On the subject of character voice acting, I would like to say the majority of the character cast fulfills their role but Elaina herself can sometime display childish tendencies, which translates to some awkward moments in the show. Other than that, the anime contains charming themes with an elegant tranquility, especially for its opening music song and general pace of its soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Yes, it’s only 12 episodes long and the light novel has more content if you’re thirsty to continue Elaina’s journey. But judging on the anime adaptation, this is nothing short of a hallmark of entertainment. It shows that when a show with creative ideas and charming character cast is executed together, the storytelling sells itself. You can be the judge and decide to recommend this to others or not. But for me, Majo no Taibitai is a show that sets a fantasy adventure by excellence.

    I&#039;m not entirely sure why I watched four episodes of this show. Everything, from the original light novel cover to the studio (C2C) and production team, made me think nothing but “oh, it&#039;s just another mediocre LN adaptation” and prefer to choose more entertaining shows from this season instead. However, the power of MAL hype is strong, and hot discussions about the third episode attracted my attention. New Kino no Tabi? A show where the protagonist is not the purest person in the whole world and can make decisions that fall in the morally grey territory? Not your typical LN adaptation? Ok, ok, I gave

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361099">
        it a try… and what a disappointment, even for my low expectations.<br />
<br />
What “deep” things people find here? What “not your cute fantasy with cute waifus” type of stuff? It’s just another boredom that uses an imitation of deep content instead of really deep things; an anime where primitive and childish stories (remember kids, stealing is bad; remember kids, train hard and be nice with other people) are mixed with… another primitive and childish stories. Episode 3? Ok, there are flowers, they are (spoiler) and caused some (spoiler). Moral of the story? “Even beautiful roses have their thorns”. WOW, so deep, so philosophical, so unique, so meaningful! Who cares about Kino&#039;s Journey, we have a new seasonal king here! How that moral lessons for 12 years old kids can be even a little interesting? Just how?<br />
<br />
Our protagonist, Elaina? The road movie is a rough genre, but a charismatic, charming main character can make even a clichéd story enjoyable. What we have here? Naive and egoistic b… witch. Sorry, I wanted to like this girl — tried to see her inner demons, her philosophical point of view as a traveler, her interesting decisions due to the episodes, but nah — “praise me more” and “I don’t want to know what happened with a slave girl” are two phrases that describe our MC perfectly. She just doesn’t care about anything, even about her journey and the places where she travels; our witch is too epic for all that plebs. Kino wasn’t a superman, and two girls from Shoujo Shuumatsu weren&#039;t powerful magicians; instead of them, Elaina can use her magic to change something — destroy flowers, take care of the slave girl, et cetera. However, she doesn’t want to do it at all and just leave things to happen. Reason? She doesn’t care. Ok, and why should I?<br />
<br />
Art and animation? Go to the C2C official site, type “generic cute light novel fantasy designs” and you’ll get everything that you can see in Wandering Witch. Spend the rest of your budget for some cool magical fights (but not so much — it’s not a Harry Potter, our money isn’t infinite, remember?) and use CG for everything else. CG butterflies. CG roofs &amp; flowers. CG witches. CG backgrounds. CG CG. Sad bad true, nowadays animators forgot how to draw and use CG instead of everything. Who are we to blame them?<br />
<br />
I wanted to see something unique here. Just something that can give me emotions — happiness, sadness, pain, interest, maybe even anger. However, there is nothing much to say about Elaina — it’s just mediocre. Mediocre adaptation of the mediocre light novel in the castle of mediocrity: boring, uninspiring, nothing to grab my attention at all. Want to watch another clichéd anime fantasy? Try Majo no Tabitabi — maybe you will enjoy it, and even add Elaina to your favorites, because why not. What about me? Sorry, but I prefer Strike Witches, not Generic ones. Peace.

    This show is pretty darn awful.  Spoilers... but nothing that important, as the show itself makes all too clear.<br />
<br />
Determined girl devotes herself to the study of magic so she can become a witch and travel the world.  Only, we don&#039;t get to see her train, or devote herself, or observe the trials she faces, except when her foreigner witch teachers beats her up out of nowhere to teach her humility.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s not what the show is about!  It&#039;s about her travels afterwards!  How she visits people across the world and touches their lives!<br />
<br />
Only she doesn&#039;t.  She&#039;s a passive observer to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361172">
        all kinds of things happening.  Mainly people dying... and she does nothing about it.  She doesn&#039;t help, or use her powers to change the outcomes of any situations, even though the show makes her out to be an extremely powerful mage.  She teaches a kid who&#039;s pretending to be bad at magic how to ride a broom, except she already knows how... (still not sure what role Ellania actually played for her...) and she digs a hole.  Also she fixes a teapot.  None of these things actually help people or prevent tragedy.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s the point!  The world isn&#039;t all roses and marshmallows!  Ellania must learn this by zooming around and seeing sad things happen to other people!<br />
<br />
So this is just Kino no Tabi on a broomstick?  They took a slightly-better than average show concept, removed the titular talking motorcycle (also removing the main character&#039;s foil with whom she could have verbalized her thoughts on the events she witnesses), and slapped more comedically cliche tragic events on the line-up... gave the main character magical powers she could actually use to help people, and then have her still not help people.<br />
<br />
At least in Kino no Tabi the main character usually had some kind of stake in what was going on, or got dragged into things forcibly.  Ellania literally just waltzes in, puts her hands on her hips and goes &#039;huh.&#039;  Gives the one-off, episodic characters &#039;looks of judgement&#039; as they do dumb stuff and then peaces out.<br />
<br />
This pretentious show is almost unbearably stupid, and after the first episode had me a little hyped up, too!  The art is really nice though, and the sound design of the magic is good.

    This show is magic and there isn’t a better way to describe it, rarely do you see such a perfect adaption of a Light Novel into the anime medium. This review will expand on why I believe this is among the best LN adaptations ever done, and how the show effectively executed its story, art, soundtrack, characters, in a way that exceeds other LN adapts. <br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
The Journey of Elaina is essentially Kinos Journey meets fantasy magic world, Elaina travels to all sorts of interesting destinations and meets all sorts of unique people, along the way she might make friends, the occasional

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368400">
        enemy, or completely choose to avoid everything and remain neutral. The show is very episodic, and many episodes will contain their own story or even multiple stories, however that does not mean the show doesn’t have a good plot, overall even the short stories are well written and have important messages that are conveyed to audience outright or in subtle ways.<br />
<br />
Some of the better stories are whole episodes and focus on an interesting setting in countries with special rules or attractions that Elaina adapts to, she may make friends in these countries or maybe she will have a hard time, but they always end with Elaina having a great story to tell when she gets back home. She might visit a country that only magicians can enter or a country without magicians, she might meet thieves or people trying to scam her but also meet friendly people who help her expecting nothing in return. The journey she travels on parallels real life backpacking, and really exemplifies how big and diverse the world is, and how many different experiences a person can come across depending on their circumstances.<br />
<br />
Some aspects of the show are a bit hard to watch, but they are grounded in realism, there are bad people out there and there are plenty of countries where the rules and customs may conflict with your moral outlook, for example with slavery. This show delivers these experiences without holding back and demonstrates how people can think and act in entirely different ways from what the audience or Elaina view as moral, without being cardboard villains. In comparison to the original light novel, this had skipped very little important information and it was largely faithful of every section covered, the studio went out of its way to make sure all the little details of the story were added and it helped make the world all the more immersive.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
From an excellently choregraphed and well animated fight in episode 1, to amazing particle effects and endless gorgeous movie quality backgrounds throughout the show, this show has some of the best visuals this year. <br />
Every city, town, forest, field of flowers, general location was drawn so perfectly that it just completely draws the audience directly into the show. These are some of the most amazing locations I have ever seen in any fantasy anime, the field of flowers in the show make the audience want to experience visiting one, the city on the cliffs fills the viewer with wonder, the realistic looking clouds make the fields even more beautiful and the amazingly detailed towns really bring the show to life. The backgrounds were also able to easily communicate emotions and enhance scenes with the various coloring choices made, darker or introspective scenes had a beautiful selection of subdued colors while more pleasant scenes had light colors, the choices of colors never detracted from the backgrounds and always felt fitting for a scene. A fantasy world can be made or destroyed by the quality of the backgrounds and how appealing they are to the audience, the background art in this series was perfect and really draws the audience into the fantasy world presented and portrays it in a suitable way.<br />
<br />
The animation in the show is nothing to look down at either as it greatly exceeds what is necessary for a slice of life travelling show, in fact the action scenes in this show were among the top 3 for the entire season including actual action series. Magical effects in this show were also a treat, in most anime magic is demonstrated with balls or blasts of energy and magical circles, once in a while creative effects are used but they are rarely ever demonstrated as effectively as in this show. From magical vision enhancement, to amazing teleporting, time reversal, and storage abilities, the show brings together an array of magical effects, each demonstrated in ways that are unique and creative compared to the vast majority of anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
The sound: 8<br />
<br />
The OP was great, the soundtrack could easily draw the viewer into the show, all the background music and sound effects complemented the scenes they were in effective and generally made them even more emotional and enjoyable. The sound effects for wind, magical attacks, and water were all especially good, among the best I have ever come across in an anime. It was also nice to have all these little sound effects that are not included in most anime, such as the character walking down a staircase or tearing apart bread, it makes the world so much more immersive.<br />
<br />
Overall, the soundtrack is magical and deserves at least an 8/10 for how all-encompassing it is, how much it complemented every scene, and the strength of the OP.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
<br />
It’s important to point out ahead of time that some viewers may be seriously bothered by Elaina’s inaction and the very short periods of time she spends in the places she travels to but this has a very specific purpose. Elaina is a traveler, not a Shonen protagonist, and she cannot get to comfortable or involved in any of these places otherwise her journey would end. Elaina also promised her parents to never pick a fight even when wrongdoing is occurring, if it does not directly involve her, in order to get them to give her permission to travel in the first place.<br />
<br />
If anything, Elaina is a refreshingly realistic take on a main character, most people would not try to save everyone as a tourist in countries they visit or try to improve a situation even if they are capable of helping a bit. This is because it’s incredibly difficult to make lasting change, a country where slavery is legal would require the entire government to be overthrown in order to fix the problem, something that Elaina might not be capable of doing. There are other systemic issues presented in this series as well where Elaina will not intervene due to understanding how hard it will be to solve the problem, how her attempt to solve it could backfire, or how committed she would have to be in order to see her solution through. It is worth adding that Elaina may come across as being way to full of herself, however she largely lives up to her own hype. Elaina is in fact quite attractive and popular wherever she goes, her skill with is quite real as well given her achievement of being a witch at such a young age. There is nothing wrong with the main character being very confident in themselves if it backed up properly.<br />
<br />
Side characters like Fran and sometimes Saya were also quite nice, seeing Elaina meet them again and catch up, and learn more about each other’s lives was enjoyable. Most characters in this series do not show up again after their initial appearance, however even in a single episode they usually get a lot of development. There were side characters that made the audience feel sorry for them, characters that were lovable, characters who you wanted to see join the journey with Elaina and characters who you hate, all of these characters were developed in the span of single episodes yet felt quite real. The Journey of Elaina did an excellent job with the side characters as even though they don’t get a lot of screen time, most of the named ones had a full story told in a single episode.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
It’s a fun SOL show with some dark moments and moral lessons thrown in, don’t expect too much out of the story as it is episodic, however you can anticipate really fun characters and excellent production values. The comedic timing and reactions with Elaina are great as well, and its very fun to watch her interact with new characters and explore new nations.<br />
I would say this show was very much something that is easily enjoyed as long as you don’t over think the story and recognize that Elaina is not a Shonen hero, they are not on a journey to become a hero, they are just a tourist wherever they visit.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Relax, sit back, and enjoy as Elaina takes you to interesting countries and watch her deal with all sorts of unique situations. Everything about the show can be described as pristine, from the detailed particle effects, to the beautiful movie quality backgrounds, the soundtrack which draws you in and the characters that keep you engaged. There are very few flaws to this show and it is definitely the single best new show that aired this season, overall, it gets a solid 8/10 rating.<br />

    Major and minor episode spoilers ahead <br />
<br />
LOOK! IT&#039;S A BIRD! NO, IT&#039;S A PLANE! Oh wait, it&#039;s the MC of Majo no Tabitabi...<br />
<br />
When you watch the first 2 episodes of Majo no Tabitabi (The Journey of Elaina), you brace yourself with an egotistical, yet interesting MC, Elaina who does not hesitate to show off her bottomless confidence to those around her. While her age is a handicap to her status as a witch prodigy, Elaina is relentless in her goal of becoming an official witch and eventually finds Fran Sensee who whips her (and her ego) into shape. You really can’t help but get drawn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368388">
        in, especially when you see the first fight scene, believe it or not, GOOD CGI. It’s also not every day when a pilot episode actually gives the MC surprisingly well-done character development as well. However, don’t fool yourself with expectations that the quality will remain the same. <br />
<br />
Now where did this anime go wrong? Well...very early on actually. While Majo no Tabitabi does a good job of portraying Elaina as a 3-D character that does indeed subvert your expectations, they’re for very bad reasons. Elaina is an inconsistently selfish MC. She seems very sweet in the first 2 episodes, but if you consider her character over the entire anime, she develops into someone who only behaves for her own benefit. Unlike the &#039;cliche&#039; MCs who have to get involved in everything and become the hero, Elaina just observes what&#039;s happening and proceeds to dip from the action or chaos. She doesn’t even use any magic AT ALL. Instead of ‘hit-and-run,’ Elaina ‘sees-and-hides.’ She always has that frowny face right before she flys away on her broomstick to heaven knows where. This is not to say she&#039;s always selfish, as she has helped some people and endured training as an apprentice, but it stops giving Elaina any purpose as an actual witch in the present-time. Monster appears? Let someone else handle it!! Someone’s about to die? I’m outie. Elaina literally has a magical wand that she has hidden who knows where and gets nothing done. It’s a rule of thumb for all stories that everything introduced must be used. Majo no Tabitabi doesn’t do that. If you look at the opening, you literally see Elaina wave her wand around but s h e d o e s n ‘ t u s e i t. This anime is supposed to be about “The Journey of Elaina,” but if she&#039;s the side character for half the episodes, shouldn&#039;t it be called &quot;The Journey of Elaina...Only Sometimes?&quot; <br />
<br />
Now maybe we should cut the anime some slack y’know? It’s not in the action genre and they’re probably saving the ‘good stuff’ for later right? Well, the thing is...even the extremely dark episodes are written extremely lazily despite the artistic effort they put in. One episode starts off with a ‘Viewer Discretion is Advised’ warning which has a secondary purpose of building up momentum for an extremely suspenseful reveal. The only other time I’ve seen this warning is in SAO and well...if you know, you know how that went...Anyways, that momentum is immediately lost when Elaina the narcissist stuffs herself on free cookies while listening to the details of her next job: catching a murderer. However, if previous episodes have taught us before, Elaina doesn’t do anything, so thankfully, her employer gives her a ring that allows Elaina’s magic to be shared between users. If Elaina won&#039;t use magic, someone&#039;s gotta!! Fast forward to the actual scene with the murderer telling the audience she was abused by the people she murdered and then proceeds to wreak havoc while laughing hysterically, crying tears of blood and showing off her bloody teeth. If you’re thinking, “Really? That’s all?” You’re not the only one. Elaina just watches this happen until the murderer gets killed by Elaina’s employer. As cynical as this sounds, that episode was yawn-inducing. A summary of what Elaina did during this entire scene: Put on a ring. Take off a ring. Cry. That’s it. And they added a black screen with roll credits too just to be extra dramatic. It’s like Beyonce said, “If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it.” <br />
<br />
Forgive me if I’m being too picky, but could they not have planned the story-writing any better at all? Why do they introduce guns in an anime about magic? Why doesn’t Elaina use magic even though she’s a witch? It’s not like we haven’t seen it happen before...she’s been able to transmute hammers and also save people while drunk but she doesn’t even bother to at least save someone who literally got blasted until they were shedding blood? I’ve seen forum posters describe this anime as a mix of dark and &#039;wholesomeness,&#039; but I don’t see what’s so wholesome about a pretentious-to-a-fault character who tries to write the words &quot;I do not have a pure heart&quot; but instead writes &quot;I have a pure heart.&quot; because ‘she cannot lie.’ And don’t forget that time where she competed against someone for the title of “Grape-stomping Champion.” Only in anime can you find such ‘wholesomeness!!’ “And that’s why I love Majo no Tabitabi!!&quot;-Liar *flower effects*<br />
<br />
The transitions between episodes are aberrantly bad as well. Since there is no overarching goal for Elaina to focus on, the story just goes everywhere. One episode, we get an entire kingdom destroyed by a monster. Next episode, Elaina teaches some kids how to water bend!! We did it guys!! We found the next Avatar!! There are entire episodes dedicated to nonsensical filler where Elaina just wanders around to see what’s going on, like when a huge wall was taken down and people on opposing sides fall in ‘love at first sight.’ The biggest goal Elaina probably had in this anime was to make ‘fun memories,’ since she struggled to decide whether to help that slave girl (did I mention they randomly introduced slavery by calling a maid girl a slave? Yeah...that happened) or run away from the mass-murderer who killed an entire nation. I remember laughing when in the next episode, Fran Sensee tells Elaina, &quot;Someday I&#039;d like to hear stories of your fun memories. Please tell me lots of stories of your travels.” Elaina&#039;s memories: *broomsticking away sound effects* *slave girl episode flashbacks* *crazy ppl noises* And Elaina just says, &quot;Very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
People have also compared Majo no Tabitabi to Violet Evergarden and it’s honestly shocking to me. Their only similarity is that they are both episodic animes focused on the travels of their respective main characters. While Violet Evergarden provided me emotionally heartfelt moments, much more depth, and lots of tears, Majo no Tabitabi hits you in the head with whatever they pull of their ass like that really creepy doll episode where Elaina solved the mystery of “Who cut my hair?!” and violently lashed out at the culprit who used hair to make dolls. There is no direction with Majo no Tabitabi, such as trying to discover “What does ‘I love you’ mean?” or even something as simple as “becoming a Pokemon Master.” We end up with a purposeless story with a purposeless main character and nothing to show for it...or maybe, Elaina just decided to fly away from the writer with the actual story too! Who knows at this point?<br />
<br />
But you know what they say: &quot;Different is always better!!&quot;

    I hate the anime. I would understand the no destination part, but so far it feels like there&#039;s no story. The story isn&#039;t about a witch, it&#039;s about the witch&#039;s travels. It feels like it&#039;s just a story about what the world she lives in is like. The anime might as well get rid of the heroine and just get a narrator to explain all the places she goes to.<br />
<br />
The MC&#039;s name is Elaine, but what does she do other than travel and write? Does she like documenting? Is her purpose to document history? Or is it just for her parents to let her know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361256">
        about her travels? Which can be done by using letters, instead of a book. Is she going to get into a relationship? Not just a romantic one, but with anyone. Will she have close friends? Does she even get emotionally attached? Is MC intimidating? Kind? Impulsive? Strict? Decisive? What kind of person is she? <br />
Not one of these questions have been answered or suggested, all I can deduce is that Elaine realizes her beauty so much that she might suck herself. I feel as if the character doesn&#039;t have depth. Any person you meet like her you won&#039;t find interesting, which is why it&#039;s hard for me to be interested in this anime. I would understand being apathetic so much as to not help any person you come through, but why? There is nothing about Elaine that makes her interesting. Other than the fact that she&#039;s the youngest person to be a witch.<br />
Even the setting doesn&#039;t have a story. Why is it mostly witches respected? Are there male wizards? Are females the only one to manifest magic? With all these problems circulating, what the hell are the monarchs/presidents doing if the country is rampant with problems and people randomly dying? The reason I can think up of as to why anybody else would watch this is because Elaine is hawt.

    --------------------Beware traveller, for there be spoilers!----------------------<br />
<br />
Majo no Tabitabi has bland characters and predictable plot points, but if those were its only problems then I would&#039;ve rated this anime a 5/10.<br />
<br />
Certain episodes, especially later ones, contain an ideological underpinning (a toxic one) that many either gloss over or just don’t notice, which is understandable given the nature of the show. It’s relaxing, has cute character designs, and likes to dazzle us with a colorful palette (in these ways it contrasts with its spiritual successor, Kino no Tabi, which has a slightly grimmer outlook on the world). However, this comfy art style makes the anime perhaps even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366024">
        more dangerous: while avoiding any outright statements it instead sneaks western progressivism in a cutesy-all-smiles format, normalizing a vision of an ‘ideal’ world that is actually an oversimplification of complex issues. In this way, Majo no Tabitabi is a product of its time that probably isn’t the first to do what it does, but it definitely won’t be the last.<br />
<br />
But first, the bland characterization and predictable plot points.<br />
<br />
Kino’s backstory is interesting, yet not significantly tragic enough to overtake the unique narratives of those that she meets. It also doesn’t really matter that we don’t get her backstory until later episodes: her actions and choices alone are interesting enough to pique our curiosity, giving her a sense of mystery that is satisfyingly fulfilled once we learn of her past. Ginko from Mushishi is executed in a similar fashion.<br />
<br />
However, Elaina’s story is utterly uninteresting. She’s a generic genius who had the generic “make-her-do-things-that-make-no-sense-but-it’s-actually-to-teach-hardship” training montage. She didn’t come from a fucked up town like Kino, or have her own bizarre encounter with the Mushi like Ginko. In fact, nothing is magically impactful about Elaina’s childhood besides that one book she likes. Most well-written characters are motivated by personal experiences, mentors, and/or life-changing events. A mere book and a shitty teacher is a lackluster call to adventure.<br />
<br />
The adventures themselves are also painfully predictable. Foreshadowing isn’t bad, but sometimes I felt it was overdone to the point that the plot itself was the spoiler. Anyone with half a brain can guess the overall trajectory of each plotline and get reasonably close to the actual conclusion—this includes the all hailed episode 3. In other words, a murder mystery is boring if you already know who the murderer is.<br />
<br />
It is only episode 7 when the show starts to get interesting, though in my opinion for all the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
In the wall story, there is no reason given for its existence other than “one side wants to be better than the other”. Eventually, they tear down the wall, see that they’re not so different after all, and enter a lovey-dovey peace. It is almost needless to say that this is a gross oversimplification of political divisions across the world. If it were really that easy, then there would never be blood shed again on this planet. To insist that all conflict is a result of arrogance between the two sides, and that somehow a foreigner (or a witch) has more wisdom on the matter than the inhabitants themselves, can only be a stance that comes from a position of privilege and ignorance (which is a characterization that fits most of the witches in Tabitabi, so at least there’s that consistency).<br />
<br />
The grape-stomping story is a poor metaphor for simping. All the men in the story are dropping betabux on Rosemary’s onlyfans (by purchasing her wine), but the anime perpetuates the myth that somehow the most loyal of her followers (the bearded guy) will be rewarded with a committed relationship. It’s bullshit. There is not a single cam girl on this planet that would fall in love with one of her followers, but they rely on the myth that they would in order to exploit vulnerable virgins for money.<br />
<br />
The doll episode is a jab at otaku culture, particularly the buying and selling of figurines. All collectors, most of all the doll creator, are portrayed as deviants who would victimize women to satisfy their perverse desires. It’s the kind of malarkey propped up by the same type of people who believe that GTA spawns child serial killers. Trust me, no one is going to get raped just because a loner decided to buy a plastic model of his waifu.<br />
<br />
The most recent episode as of writing is just a shitty child abuse story created for the sake of shock value. None of it is representative of domestic violence or what actually makes a serial killer, and it isn’t artistic or deep in the slightest. At most, I can probably meme it as a Top 10 Anime Betrayals.<br />
<br />
I will continue watching the series, but only to see how far the anime degenerates narratively and morally. Keep your eyes peeled.<br />

    Every season as of late, I can’t help but find myself on the lookout for fantasy stories to sink my teeth into. Oversaturated as the genre may be, sometimes, only sometimes, among all the manufactured shlock you’re likely to find a single gem rising above. Gems in which the fantasy setting is often merely used as a backdrop for a greater purpose, while also fully exploring it without getting caught up in the numerous tired tropes.<br />
<br />
You can see why the promotional poster alone of Majo no Tabitabi sucked me in.<br />
<br />
Majo no Tabitabi started out strong. Not held back by lazy tropes, complemented with sometimes breathtaking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368434">
        visuals and a couple of OSTs that captured the magic of the genre, it wasn’t hard for it to capture my interest and had me expecting more. The lack of tasteless fanservice and the way the characters were written (in the earlier episodes) almost made me think the series’ writing had a distinctly female touch. But decently-executed fantasy often isn’t enough: it’s the focal point of the show that distinguishes it from the rest. <br />
<br />
The show is about Elaina. This is her story, her journey, and other characters are only anecdotes, mattering only in the extent of how much they relate to her. Putting aside my grievances with the series which I’ll list later, I enjoyed Elaina as a protagonist. It’s not often that a more self-centered, immodest character takes the focus (excluding the overly loud and cocky shounen protagonist trope) -- Elaina feels real, unexaggerated in her demeanor and deeply human. When Majo no Tabitabi is at its best, the show uses her journey and its magical setting to deliver certain ideas with its episodic adventures. For the first four episodes, that use of the setting pleasantly surprised me and kept me coming for more -- the show had not only subverted my expectations of a light novel-based fantasy series protagonist, but also the morals we’re used to in the medium.<br />
<br />
It is up to the individual viewer whether some of the episodes’ unusual, seemingly anti-idealistic nature feels heavy handed and edgy, or whether it’s a nice breath of fresh air. Majo no Tabitabi doesn’t indulge in edginess or try to “be different” -- while the contrast between some of the more horrible scenes and the cutesy art is a pleasure to watch, even the seemingly grim episodes have satisfying endings, and their messages are often much less edgy and more grounded than given credit for. There is one particular episode where the “edginess”, however, does undeniably stand out — and it comes after a series of more whimsical and light-hearted adventures. I think most viewers will know which episode I’m referring to. Although it’s hailed as the peak of the series, I could only find it jarring and overly shocking after all the light-heartedness that preceded it (despite the terrific job in imagery, I commend the animators). There is little point in having a shocking encounter to break the protagonist down, only to completely forget about its events in the next episodes onwards. I’m not a purist who thinks development is everything a character needs (characterization is great, people!), however, beyond that episode, even directly following it, we barely get to see how Elaina was affected (in fact, her character remains mostly static throughout the series, with some effective characterization sprinkled here and there) -- this wouldn’t have bothered me as much, had the episode not possessed the trappings of a “cathartic” episode for her.<br />
<br />
If you’ve made it this far, you’re probably wondering “how can that description be anything less than a 7?”<br />
<br />
I almost feel bad writing this part, after having such high expectations and good faith on the show, but the more I watched, I found myself realizing that too much good faith was wasted on Majo no Tabitabi.<br />
<br />
It’s hard to pinpoint when exactly my excitement for the next episode turned to mild interest, and then hope that maybe, just maybe the next episode would be better -- though if I had to say, it’d probably be after episode 4.<br />
<br />
I mentioned how natural and grounded Majo no Tabitabi feels, despite some of its more grim episodes. This only goes for the first few episodes. After a certain point, the show derails to the point of indulgence -- and I’m not talking about amped up edginess. We get a character who reminds me of Demon Slayer’s Zenitsu -- who continually follows and harasses the protagonist, takes away from whatever conflict the characters are involved in, and generally is a nuisance to watch. The gag may be funny to some the first time -- it wasn’t to me, and certainly not the second, third or seventh time. I made the Zenitsu comparison, though I feel that may’ve been unfair to him, when he has a variety of different dynamics with characters other than his love interest -- Majo no Tabitabi being focused on Elaina alone, this tomboy character’s sole intrigue is in her insistent love for Elaina, and little more. That&#039;s one weakness of the show&#039;s inherent structure, as if you can&#039;t make other characters lovable or interesting from Elaina&#039;s perspective, then they won&#039;t be lovable or interesting to the audience, either.<br />
<br />
But I could bear through a horribly-written and aggravating cast member every couple of episodes. This show had, after all, a lot of qualities I looked for in fantasy. &quot;It will get better!&quot;, I told myself. I think it was around when the show indulged in the typical sister-incest gags that I came to terms with the fact that I’ve been giving it far too much leeway for what it was, a fantasy light novel -- with all its tropes, flaws and failings, only disguised differently and unique enough not to be a waste of time. <br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the first few episodes and expected more, you&#039;re setting yourself up for disappointment. If you haven&#039;t, then you probably won&#039;t like the rest it has to offer, as it&#039;s only an inconsistent plummet downhill from there.<br />

    “Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming &quot;Wow! What a Ride!””<br />
<br />
An adventure! What a word, what a drug. After seeing something new: a new country, new people, a new language that you have not heard ever before, tasting a new dish and then returning back home you realize that you are now an addict. After all, life is too short and wasting it on games and shutting yourself at home

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368391">
        is not the best way to enjoy it. Tastes differ.  Anyways, the anime centers on a girl named Elaina. When she was a kid, she loved reading books. And among all the books she read, there was a series called &#039;Niike&#039;s Adventure&#039;, which was her favorite. It was a collection of short stories about the witch Niike&#039;s adventures around the whole world, based off of the writer’s own life experience. Elaina liked Niike’s adventures so much that starting her own adventure became her all life’s dream.<br />
<br />
Sometimes comedic, sometimes fantastical, sometimes a little dark is the best description for this anime. I guess it somewhat reminds me of Kino no Tabi, but with magic. The storyline of The Journey of Elaina is very enjoyable, the anime shows right from the very first episodes what influences Elaina to become a witch, as well as her teacher that helps her become the person she is. The Journey of Elaina is about a simple girl, who falls in love with a book so much that she decides to learn magic and to enjoy traveling just like the heroine of her favorite book. She is cheerful young lady that has had it hard in her life; being a hard worker she is, she has spent all her childhood to become a witch. Of course, being good at something, will make other people jealous of your success, but Elaina is not afraid to keep going.<br />
<br />
It is, indeed, a very enjoyable anime and it has been a while since I last saw something as enjoyable as The Journey of Elaina. But I found it somewhat lacking, not having a message for the viewer. Take for example the Journey of Kino. Here, however, it is more of a cute witch, travelling around the world and seeing that, in reality, the world that surrounds us is not as cute as one might think. <br />
 <br />
All in all, this is a rather enjoyable anime. While I do want to rate it a 7/10, I appreciate The Journey of Elaina for what it is. It never tries to resort to some cheap tricks and keeps being what it is. Of course, I would change a few things, if I could. But it is still a pretty enjoyable watch, you might like.

    Watching The Journey of Elaina feels like reading a storybook. It is about Elaina, a traveler from a faraway distant land, and her journey as she travels to lots of different places and encounters new people. The show seemed like a happy go lucky anime at first, surprisingly it has a darker tone. It shows how harsh reality and the truth could be as Elaina journeys around the world. It is like the fairy tale you read as a child however not all fairy tales have happy endings. <br />
<br />
When Elaina encounters problems along the way. She may seem not to care but she does. She

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361116">
        feels responsible and she has to live with those feelings. However, it does not mean she is obligated to help them. That&#039;s the beauty of the anime. In reality, you are under no obligation to help someone in distress. In Elaina&#039;s case, she simply wants to travel around the world. That is why she wanted to become a witch to travel! She can help whenever she wants. She will help when she can.<br />
 <br />
While listening to the opening song, Literature by Reina Ueda, I feel so relaxed and calm. You can feel the fun adventures of Elaina, and how light, mesmerizing, and exciting it could be. However, in the ending song 灰色のサーガ by ChouCho you feel the opposite, you can feel how dark, strange, and frightening the journey of Elaina but in a good way. Which is why I love both the opening and ending song.<br />
 <br />
You can learn a lot of things in this show and it is simply beautiful.<br />
Please give this show a watch, Majo no Tabitabi needs more recognition!<br />

    The first episode was absolutely amazing and definitely peaked my interest in watching this anime without any research on it. It was beautifully animated and stunningly well written.<br />
<br />
unfortunately however that is where it all goes downhill, after the first episode the story becomes boring and very much a monster of the week style of show. The animation quality seems to have had half the budget after the first episode and looses the beauty that it had.<br />
<br />
I recommend to anyone to watch the first episode and that is a solid 8/10 for me, but after that episode the show is at best a 5/10.

    This is Kino&#039;s travels (or the many other travel anime) mixed in with a kawaii magic girl main character. If you don&#039;t like either genre, you won&#039;t like this show. There is no world-building, because there is no world (aside from the magical girl trope). It&#039;s episodic and each story self-contained. A collection of disparate folktales with a magic girl inserted in there as an observer. There&#039;s a reason why Disney can only really adapt a handful of old fairy tales to create our fondest childhood memories (and big blockbuster success). Because there are really only a handful of coherent ones with positive messages. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362161">
        other 99% are mostly just dark, nonsensical, ill-defined, inconclusive, depressing, or subversive. There are no lessons taught, other than maybe a fatalistic one. If you enjoy irrational, just open up a newspaper. The MC has no personality other than what is required to push a particular tale along. The very first episode is indicative of the meaninglessness of the rest of the series. Her doting parents hire a witch to abuse and near-kill her to instill humility? Even though she has displayed no arrogance, entitlement, or moral degeneracy? I really only started watching this because the production budget seemed higher than the rest. Maybe the story would be interesting, or there would be interesting characters. Nope to all.

    Fiction is all about perspective, and what can be taken from a piece of art will depend on the person viewing it. This is an incredibly generic opening statement that can be plastered onto any review for anything in existence, but such a primal notion is paramount to The Journey of Elaina. It’s a series that lives and dies by your appreciation of the main character, or lack thereof. It’s a collection of vignettes that can either move you, or have you mumbling “What the hell was the point of that?” at the end of twenty-two minutes.<br />
<br />
“Who’s that hot witch who’s also a bad bitch?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368423">
        That’s right, it’s me.” --Elaina (probably)<br />
<br />
Welcome to the wonderful witch waifu show! Elaina has a big hat that looks really cool and she has long silver hair, 10/10 flawless character design. Also she’s smug as shit and that’s funny and also based. Good show.<br />
<br />
Elaina is a terrible person who willingly enables bad things to happen to other people; she has the power to make positive changes but chooses not to out of her own convenience. She’s incredibly stuck-up, self-centered and rude whose only likable trait is being cute.<br />
<br />
This is all well and good and all but it’s basically Kino’s Journey again, just with more magic and less talking motorcycles, and also less set rules for the main character.<br />
<br />
I’m not trying to throw you off with conflicting opinions, these are just various things I’ve heard others say about the series. And they’re all valid statements. Elaina’s journey is not a clear, focused narrative, largely guided by the actions and personality of the titular character. As simple as that is, it’s plenty of cause for division.<br />
<br />
Elaina is not a hero and it’s made clear rather quickly. More often than not, she chooses to stay out of conflicts, even if she seems to have the power to take action and solve them. Her main interest is her main interest, and all she wants to do is see the world around her. On top of this, she thinks highly of herself, not just by keeping herself out of harm’s way, but also by never sparing a moment to compliment herself.<br />
<br />
As said, your opinion of Elaina the character will completely influence your opinion of Elaina the show. So what do I think of Elaina? <br />
<br />
Oh, ho ho ho………<br />
<br />
You want to know what I think?! <br />
<br />
Ha ha ha ha!!<br />
<br />
She’s a great character.<br />
<br />
You might be wondering if my infatuation with witches and their stupid ass hats is the reason why.  Well, anon, let me tell you, I’m not so shallow as to completely set aside all personal beliefs for cute girls in big hats. But yes, that’s correct. <br />
<br />
Joking aside and alongside, Elaina is funny. She’s witty, she’s relatable, and I think she’s interesting. It’s been a while since I’ve enjoyed a character in an adventure series like this, and many of her moments had me smiling. With a series of short stories about different pieces of the world, the two options are to make the world good or to make the character experiencing the world good. Ideally, you’d like to have both, but unfortunately that doesn’t happen in this series, and we’ll get to that. Not all stories are created equal, both in regards to the entire medium of fiction and the collection of Elaina’s travels. Some episodes were quite interesting and memorable and others felt rather pointless and silly. Despite an unbalance of quality, one element was consistently amusing: Elaina herself.<br />
<br />
With a large world offering many different concepts, a more plain character is typical, as it allows the world to shape and develop them while also letting us project onto them more easily. Elaina isn’t an example of this--although I do relate to her much more than a generic adventure protag. Her laid-back attitude was what related me to the character, and her bold self-appreciation, often stepping into pure entitlement, was endearing and made her stand out a lot. She’ll often ask the audience directly who’s “that beautiful girl with ashen hair flutters in the wind, etc.” but her own self-entitlement will bleed into her everyday actions, like in episode two. After a clumsy apprentice mage crashes into her, sending them both falling onto a roof and destroying it, Elaina shows more concern for the lack of an apology from this girl rather than the blood trickling out of her head.<br />
<br />
It’s a quiet, subtle savagery that just makes her so enjoyable. Her reactions to things around her are often sarcastic and witty, and despite a general lack of initiation she’ll take to conflict, anything bad that happens to her will immediately enrage her to the point of threatening to kill. Said bad things include cutting her hair, swapping bodies with her, or making fun of her chest (or lack thereof lmoa).<br />
<br />
Most of the series is whimsical and largely undramatic, but Elaina doesn’t go entirely unchallenged. Occasionally, she WILL face an unpleasant situation and find herself unable to do anything about it--not actually from a lack of desire, but due to the laws of a region or her own lack of experience and power. Whether it causes a grimace on her face or a full blown meltdown, the dark realities of the world don’t leave her completely unfazed, and her weakness comes out.<br />
<br />
If there’s any big problem with the journey, it’s that these moments don’t occur enough. Most of Elaina’s stories hold little to no consequence to them, which is why the character becomes so centralizing to its enjoyment. Some of these stories just happen and they could be mildly amusing for what they are, but a lot of them can feel largely unimportant and forgettable. For that reason, episode 9 truly stands out as the one episode with consequence and impact, where it feels like Elaina is truly tested and affected by this story. Even its music and cinematography are elevated much more seriously to the point where it almost feels like an entirely different show, and it’s a shame that it didn’t bleed into the episodes after it, because it was a genuinely terrific episode.<br />
<br />
The other exception is the final episode, and without spoiling anything, it actually does connect the pieces together and ties Elaina&#039;s journey up into a nice, satisfactory ending. It highlights the consequences of Elaina&#039;s actions by showing different outcomes that might&#039;ve happened had she done something differently, reinforcing the story&#039;s themes and giving weight to the past stories. It&#039;s also delivered in the most Elaina way possible, and I mean that in the most literal way possible. The finale is definitely worth the eleven episodes that build up to it.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, Elaina is joined by some other characters--I’m sorry if this statement caused you to leap out of your seat. Her mentor satisfies the trope of stupidly powerful characters with lovable,  lackadaisical personalities, especially with the voice of Kana Hanazamallamasama. Saya is the main subject of consequence from Elaina’s journey, as she enters the series as a fledgling mage who Elaina coddles somewhat, to quickly becoming a witch herself who then spends her screentime simping for Elaina as hard as she can. It’s good to have a character I can relate to so well. Her mentor, Shiela, is somewhat unremarkable outside of her tomboyish personality and the fact that she smokes out of a pipe and rides a motorized broom, so actually she’s really fucking cool. They’re alright.<br />
<br />
The art is often quite good; never bordering on the territory of fantastic, but characters are well-designed, detailed, and animated with care. Background art is often given a great amount of attention-to-detail, but can easily go unnoticed for the settings themselves being fairly normal and uninteresting. Nothing in this series would win any sort of awards for presentation, except maybe the directing of episode 9 which was actually fire, but it’s all cleanly above-average and contributes enough.<br />
<br />
Elaina deserves its divisive reputation, and maybe that was the point all along. Good stories aren’t necessarily made to be agreed with, it’s the way they’re told and what happens that defines them. Having clear, set attributes will only appeal to those who can appreciate them, and for me Elaina’s personality is what helps me get through the day. But it’s true that the series could have done more, and one can only hope that future installments can elevate it to the heights that it’s teased us with.<br />
<br />
In other words, Elaina is my waifu and she can do whatever she wants because I said so and if you don’t like it then fight me irl punk<br />
