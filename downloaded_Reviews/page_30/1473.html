Well, well. What have I got to say... That was some pretty good words coming from a guy who has spent so much time trying to get her to wake up again. This Sci-Fi romance film was something I wouldn&#039;t have expected to be extraordinary, I kind of kept my hopes down for the entire film. But after watching the movie, it felt... decent? good?

To begin with, the story felt... confusing? Especially at the end, it might make you go, &quot;what just happened?&quot; Well yeah, that was me as well. But if you got confused at any part during the movie other than the last, I suggest you go watch Steins;Gate again to turn yourself into a true mad scientist! (Not sponsored by Dr. Pepper)  However, you got to catch the information quickly especially at the first when it was the most crucial about his future self explaining about ALLTALE Quantum technology. If you missed that, good luck trying to understand the whole movie. If you didn&#039;t miss that however, good for you then! You have just gotten the whole gist of the movie. Now onto the romance, as a romance-freak, I don&#039;t know I should be happy or not. But all Naomi did was just follow his future self&#039;s instruction and got her in the basement. Why can&#039;t that happen to me as well? I want my future self to get me a girlfriend too! Sadly, this is indeed a Sci-Fi movie so I cannot complain and whine about it, but still! <br />
<br />
Now onto the art &amp; animation, which the art felt lackluster in emotions for a Romance film. However, do keep in mind that this a full CGI film, so get ready to see some wack animation. I only noticed one however, but it downgraded the whole thing since that animation was literally one of the simplest ones that is given a lot of time, I can probably do it as well. Back to the art, although lackluster, there were a few scenes that were incredibly cute thanks to the visuals. So it depends on whether you care about the Romance or the Sci-Fi, and then you see it yourself from a specific viewpoint then on. What I have to seriously criticize on however is the amount of color they used in the movie. Oh my lord there was so much rainbow beams shining everywhere my eyes actually hurt from watching. That is one thing I want everyone to take note of : A LOT OF RAINBOW<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the music was pretty dope. It&#039;s honestly personal preference though since we all have different tastes in music. But for me, I loved it. As for the voice actors, they&#039;ve honestly done a pretty good job at... doing their job? There were some moments however that should&#039;ve been implied harder than what was screened. So... director&#039;s issue? I don&#039;t understand the industry that much so I assume I have no say in something trivial like this. But still, good job.<br />
<br />
Okay, Ruri and Naomi were so cute together it just felt amazing. (and then the story went downhill from there but let&#039;s not talk about the sad times) | Naomi in the future felt like a how a mentor should feel like, although there were *some* &quot;disagreements&quot;, he has done his part well at tutoring himself in the past. Naomi in the past wasn&#039;t a wimp either, you can see the his development throughout the story through sheer willpower to save Ruri. He isn&#039;t that wimpy kid that doesn&#039;t even dare to enter the library anymore, he is a reliable and independent teen that people can rely on. As for Ruri, the only true character development she got was only when she is with Naomi. But without her, this whole story wouldn&#039;t have existed so she is still crucial for the story.<br />

Haha, I know everyone is waiting for this. If you hated this movie, you will want me to type here : I hated this shit 0/10 no watch pls. Vice versa, if you loved this movie, you will want me to type here : I loved this movie omg 10/10 pls watch. I&#039;ll be honest here, I have mixed feelings for the movie. For me, I love sci-fi theories and I read a lot about them. So naturally I understood and enjoyed the movie. But at the same time, I love to look at things on an unbiased scale. What about the people who just came here with no knowledge of sci-fi whatsoever? Will they know what&#039;s the butterfly effect? A parallel world? A paradox? Naturally, they will get confused and not enjoy the movie as much as I did. Personally, the romance contributed a great factor for those who did not understand the sci-fi stuff IMO. As I said above, I am a romance-freak, so I savored every moment of romance the movie contained. Now for the big revelation, I will get my enjoyment an 8/10.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you have epilepsy, I will not recommend this movie due to the amount of colors and the motion. If you do not however, I can recommend it if you like Sci-Fi or romance. Or else, if you just like anything you watch then why are you here? Go ahead. However, if you are a critic that hates CGI, romance and time traveling. Then please, do not watch this. I already warned you beforehand. Well then, signing off. El Psy Congroo<br />

    I was going to hold this review back, but upon seeing what made it to the forefront of the reviews, I thought some differing opinions could spark conversation. <br />
TL;DR Score: 5 - First half good second half bad. <br />
Incidentally, you watch Another World AFTER this movie. <br />
Story:<br />
Most of the problems stem from the flawed and convoluted story. To put it simply, it&#039;s split into 2 parts. The first part is a fairly pleasant romance drama. The second part is mostly an action flick with scifi themes. I also don&#039;t mean that there are 2 stories, rather that the 1 story really shifts gears halfway through

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321390">
        following a decent plot twist. <br />
The first part is actually reminiscent of Orange, although with the key difference that the future MC time travelled instead of a letter. Basically, the future MC aims to hook up present MC with a girlfriend to avoid later tragedy. This is actually pretty good, because the future MC is a very decent character with fun interactions (I&#039;ll get back to this later). The pacing is well done because we&#039;re always on the edge of our seat to see how the Naomi (the MC) and his future self manage to pull off this unlikely romance. Part of why I say it&#039;s good would be because I&#039;m partial to character drama, but even if it wasn&#039;t amazing it was still enjoyable. Unfortunately most of this part is retroactively made worse by the fact that most of the plot here doesn&#039;t actually make sense when given information from the second part. In addition, most of the events that future Naomi ended up changing weren&#039;t necessary at all because they would&#039;ve happened anyway. The only reason that the ultimate goal ended up being so difficult was because all the previous unnecessary changes pinged the &quot;antivirus&quot;. It was still enjoyable in the moment at least. <br />
The second part is mostly cheap action scenes with some scifi themes overlayed on it. When I say cheap, I mean that the amount of action scenes is disproportionate to their relevancy to the plot. It just seemed like an excuse for animations, and in my opinion they went on for far too long. This shift in focus was extremely unwelcome to me, personally. The second part also has another plot twist halfway through, but unlike the first twist, it is barely expounded upon and seems likely to confuse the audience unless they do some mental gymnastics. At the very end of the movie they reference that twist again (and failed to explain it again), and by that point most of the audience forgot about the twist because they didn&#039;t understand it so they&#039;re confused again. As a result the ending is not very satisfying, even as someone who &gt;mostly&lt; understood the twist (I have some grievances with it but I&#039;ll assume it makes sense). I saw some other reviews compare the twists to Steins;Gate, and I disagree here not because the twist wasn’t complicated, but because unlike Steins;Gate it establishes the rules, makes a plot twist by breaking the rules and implying the rules were false, and completely fails to properly establish what the true rules were in the end. So basically, it is extremely unforgiving to those who miss clues or such, which is not a good thing. People who are proud of understanding the plot twist should be proud, but that’s not good for a movie that supposed to have widespread appeal. Perhaps they could’ve spent more time on explanations rather than incessant action scenes. <br />
Something that perhaps only I didn&#039;t enjoy was that the technology was rooted in reality to the extent that I completely failed to suspend disbelief when they begun to stretch it. To try and explain one example without spoiling, for some reason specific data can only be moved but not copied... for some reason... when the data was originally a copy to begin with...<br />
Another stretch was the hilariously impractical visual portrayal of the antivirus. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It does fairly well when it sticks to 2D animation and some simple 3D animation (like during the romance drama scenes in the first half). When it tried to do more dynamic 3D animation, although sometimes it looks pretty good, it ends up looking atrociously bad at times. I only have the impressions of when I watched it in cinemas, but I remember thinking that some action scenes look like they could&#039;ve been made in Counterstrike (edit: on rewatch this holds true, although they&#039;re sparser than I remember). The overall variable quality of the animation actually did end up detracting from my enjoyment, which I consider to be very unusual considering the fact that this was a movie. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Unfortunately I did not pay too much attention to sound, but it was pretty good and I don&#039;t remember any music being used in inappropriate contexts or such. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
These were good when they were the spotlight of the movie, rather than 3D fight scenes. Naomi is rather generic, but at least he has some personality. Future Naomi&#039;s snarky attitude and overbearing nature was actually pretty great. Ruri&#039;s personality was sufficient to understand why Naomi would be attracted to her, and they have cute interactions. One thing that I did find fairly amusing was how Ruri, despite having no knowledge of the scifi shenanigans, just completely rolls with everything when being thrown into the deep end during the second half. <br />
One characterization moment that I did appreciate was when they showed how Naomi&#039;s passive nature affected his everyday life, and later contrasted it with the personality of Ruri. Although perhaps it was a bit on the nose, it worked and was a nice touch. <br />
One characterization moment that I didn&#039;t appreciate as much was how they developed future Naomi, because he ends up being a bit of a lone wolf character despite the fact that he didn&#039;t really need to be and that nothing in his backstory would suggest such a thing. He seems to have very good relations with his coworkers and such, but does not confide anything to them. This had fairly heavy implications on the plot as well. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Although I enjoyed watching the first half, the incessant action scenes and incredibly convoluted nature of the second half drained all the enjoyment out of me. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I gave it a 5, mostly carried by the first half.

    Been invited to watch this-- advanced special screening in PH. Oct 28.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s definitely 100% CG but it&#039;s not a bad cg. It&#039;s a very well made cg, consistent, trippy -- there&#039;s so many &quot;inception-ish&quot; going  on and I understand why they made the whole thing in cg. <br />
<br />
- The characters are likeable like they are straight outta tamako market<br />
- The sound design is outstanding 10/10<br />
- Story is interesting, some parts are cliche but the plot twist is a bruh moment <br />
- art is.. its ajin on steroids <br />
<br />
Im gonna rewatch it again when it airs here on the 30th. <br />
PS: I enjoyed this more

    『HELLO WORLD』Movie Review<br />
<br />
A Sci-Fi Romance Film themed:<br />
What if you had the chance to change one important day? A new day that can save the life of the only girl you loved. Will you take the risk and face the dangers and consequences?<br />
<br />
Synopsis: <br />
A man travels in time from the year 2027 to relive his school years and to correct a bad decisions.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
&quot;I just wanted to see her smile again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Even if the world is destroyed, I want to see you one more time.&quot;<br />
~~~<br />
Movie Review: (Non-Spoiler)<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Great and interesting story. Romance: 10/10.<br />
At first it was confusing for me, then I realized &quot;You&#039;re lucky if you&#039;ve already watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320976">
        Steins;Gate&quot; as it&#039;s really the best Sci-Fi anime that ever existed. We go back to the movie, since it&#039;s a Sci-Fi anime, you would really be confused at first then until there&#039;s the time where you&#039;ll finally get the flow of the story.  <br />
I can give it a 10 overall in the story but there were just some cliche scenes. <br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
That plot twist tho. It made me happy and broken-hearted at the same time.<br />
<br />
Animation: 10/10 MINDBLOWING!!<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of art or animation scenes then this movie is a must watch for you. There were some aesthetic and realistic sceneries that you&#039;ll love to see. The movie is CGI overall. ROYGBIV animation means a lot of RAINBOW colored animation and effects. I get it why they focused on CGI. I loved the animation overall.<br />
<br />
Sounds: 10/10<br />
The soundtrack is literally great as well as the sound effects. It really syncs with the animation and the scenes<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
Cute and almost similar to KyoAni (the character designer was from Tamako Market/Love Story so basically that&#039;s his reference in my opinion). Best character was Naomi the male lead, his character development throughout the movie was amazing but without Ruri the story would be different. <br />
<br />
Casts: 9/10<br />
Japanese Actors/Actress voicing an anime character is not new to me since I&#039;m an avid fan of them and JDrama as well but I love the way they perform each of their roles especially Tori Matsuzaka who voiced the older Naomi. The chemistry of Minami Hamabe and Takumi Kitamura never changed since their portrayal of &quot;I Want to Eat Your Pancreas&quot; Live Action (I love these two ❤)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
The movie was not I&#039;ve expected after watching the trailer several times. It was totally unexpected for me so I really enjoyed the whole movie. I was like, &quot;Ohh, so this movie is something different.&quot; Some cute moments etc,. The story, animation, characters, casts and sounds were great overall. ❤❤ <br />
Best Sci-Fi Romance anime movie I&#039;ve seen and watched so far.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t tell me I made it overrated. To be honest I just really love Sci-Fi anime and then you add or mix it with romance?? Oh my, it&#039;s already a bonus ❤<br />
Must-watch for animation lovers especially those who love Sci-Fi a lot. <br />
<br />
Congrats 🎉 and Thank You ❤ to all the people who were behind in making this wonderful movie. <br />

    This review contains minor spoilers, wherein I mainly elaborate on aspects of the story covered by the synopsis.<br />
<br />
Simply put, Hello World is garbage. I could go into an endless stream of comical hyperbole in order to detail this, but I won&#039;t waste any time. If you&#039;re already familiar with how bad a Mado Nozaki story can be from Babylon or Seikaisuru Kado, don&#039;t be. This is much, much worse.<br />
<br />
Hello World attempts to be a sci-fi romance flick, but unfortunately fails at the latter, and stumbles all over the former. The romance in this film is supposed to be assumed as true, both because our protagonist,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335103">
        Naomi Katagaki, gets roped into having a girlfriend by his future self, and also because it isn&#039;t actually developed in any real way aside from a montage of  uninteresting events set to a forgettable J-pop song, sandwiched by scenes of cliched romantic tiptoeing. Right after confessing to his future self&#039;s girlfriend, Ruri Ichigyou, all romantic development stops and the rest of the film is fully dedicated to the sci-fi aspects of the story, which are just as bad. I&#039;ll avoid spoilers, but basically the worldbuilding is conveyed either through long, awkward, and cumbersome scenes of expository dialogue, or through vague, confusing, and contradictory &quot;no actually&quot; moments. This, I assume, is Nozaki&#039;s attempts at writing a clever narrative, but instead comes across as two stoner tabletop game DMs having an imagination battle. None of it is truly creative or original, it&#039;s just a collision of tropes established by other stories.  <br />
<br />
The characters are bland, trite, and have characteristics that are in opposition of each other. Naomi is introduced as the quiet, meek bookworm, but these aspects of his personality are quickly thrown away because they would hinder the plot progression, and he becomes able to process and adapt to reality shattering events with the same mental fortitude of an Elder Scrolls protagonist, and it&#039;s waved away because he&#039;s &quot;familiar with sci-fi books&quot;, which should again clue you in on how creative the sci-fi aspects of this movie actually are. Ruri is introduced as the quiet, assertive bookworm. This is the part where I&#039;d talk about her, but she actually doesn&#039;t do anything. She&#039;s like the flag in a game of Capture the Flag, she&#039;s an objective, not really a character. If I were to write out all of the dialogue she&#039;s given in the film, it probably wouldn&#039;t even fill up two pages. This is the main love interest in a romance movie. Future Naomi is introduced as the reliable chad doing everything for his love, but he spends the entire movie getting cucked, sometimes of his own volition, which is quite unfortunate, but also a little funny, because I don&#039;t think Nozaki was intentionally going for that. There&#039;s no particular reason to subject him to that, he&#039;s written to be a sympathetic character, so I can only assume it turned out that way as a result of incompetence. <br />
<br />
I should also address the visuals. They&#039;re not good. The models are pre-shaded CG, meaning the shadows cast on them in scenes don&#039;t change naturally. A character will look out of a window and his face will be illuminated by the light streaming in from outside. Whether or not he is properly illuminated in this initial position is a different story, but the real disaster comes when he turns his head away from the window and his face remains fully illuminated. Only when his head is a full 180° away from the window do the shadows awkwardly pop in. This isn&#039;t something everyone will notice on a first watch, but once you do notice it, it becomes impossible to not notice, and remains distracting throughout the whole film. Aside from the shading issues, the CG models sometimes use the emotive faces found in a lot of 2D anime, and it always looks strange when they do. There&#039;s also various visual design choices which look absolutely hideous. For example, Naomi gets a glove that&#039;s an ultra-shiny teal. It looks absolutely disgusting because it has no visual cohesion with anything else in the entire movie, which mainly employs warm tones and then later an unsaturated aesthetic, and it&#039;s distracting in every scene that it&#039;s in. There&#039;s also lots of things with thin, rainbow colored stripes which look equally awful. <br />
<br />
In summation, this movie is head-to-toe awful (with the exception of sound direction, which was unremarkable), and is a generally terrible experience, far beyond the acceptable range of bad in the phrase, &quot;so bad it&#039;s entertaining&quot;. Watch at your own peril.

    I had a couple of &quot;What the fuck is this shit&quot; moments during my watch but it ended up as &quot;What the actual fuck is this shit&quot;. <br />
<br />
Story 5/10<br />
So the story takes place in Kyoto of 2027 where technology has fairly advanced, portraying the life of a socially awkward book-loving boy Naomi Katagaki and a book loving-girl named Ruri Ichigyou who has a cold personality. It&#039;s all good till this part.<br />
So, this boy one day gets to meet his future self who came from 10 years later to meet his past self but not so that he could try to change the future regarding the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343114">
        tragedy that is yet to come for Ruri but instead he reveals that this world is all a simulation and all he wants to do is capture some joyful moments of Ruri. But it&#039;s all a trainwreck after it, could be spoilers so I am skipping out on it.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation 9/10<br />
Even tho it&#039;s CG but it&#039;s the good kind of CG, it&#039;s only disturbing for couple of minutes but then you get used it. For me, the background art was most astounding aspect of this movie, seeing Kyoto in an aesthetically rendered version of itself was really blissful. Can&#039;t say the same for character art tho, they were very similar to KyoAni.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
The aural aspects actually made me enjoy this trainwreck of a movie, specially the insert song for the ending sequence. Even still I don&#039;t really remember any other outstanding soundtrack from it. <br />
<br />
Characters 4/10<br />
The character models and character writing was all pretty generic. First of all the main characters looked like they&#039;re stolen from KyoAni.<br />
And there&#039;s nothing much interesting about the characters in case of writing as well, socially awkward boy falls in love and now will do anything to save his love which includes fucking up a world. And lord, the female lead was so dull, I mean she didn&#039;t even say a single word seeing her lover do some stupid sci-fi stuff through his hand. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10<br />
I somewhat enjoyed the movie but too many &quot;What the fuck is this shit&quot; moments ruined my enjoyment from time to time. <br />
<br />
Overall I&#039;d give it a 5.2, truthfully it&#039;s another good concept but yet again suffering from bad execution of plot. The characters could use some better writing, albeit the art and animation was amazing.

    This is not a review, it&#039;s more of a quick explanation, since I believe most of people didn&#039;t understand the end of the movie, especially those who gave it a bad score. (I believe they were expecting a cute romance anime).<br />
<br />
The one who actually got struck by lightning and declared brain dead was actually Naomi all along, and Ruri was the one tryna save him, everthing that happened in the movie was basically a dream within a dream.<br />
<br />
The animation in the OVA and the whole movie were actually in 3D, however, the scene before the credits was in 2D, which means the simulation exists in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373422">
        3D animation, while reality is in 2D. Therefore, everything that we watch, if it&#039;s in 3D form is not real, otherwise, why would they change the animation at the end? That would make no sense, right!<br />
<br />
Ruri was the same crow observing him for three months, in the movie, it was suggested that who ever dives into the past can actually change their avatar however they want. <br />
<br />
Ruri dived into the past to gather data and sychronize the memory from Naomi in order to wake him up from a comatose state, she was also the one who guided him using the crow avatar from the beginning until the end of the movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. This is just my theory, don&#039;t hold me accountable.

The premise of a future mc helping out the current mc to get a girlfriend was an interesting concept. It would have been great if they kept the plot as beIng a romantic movie, as the first half of the movie was just that, awkward mc trying to get to know the female mc. I would have accepted if the movie did not elaborate much about the future mc so as to move the plot along.<br />
<br />
However, when the movie tried to incorporate too much scientific manbo jambo ala inception in the second half, it became boring in the sense that things became too complicated. Virtual

        world within a virtual world trying to rectify things in yet another virtual world.<br />
<br />
Plot should have stuck to mc in the opening, trying to win the heart of the female mc who is in a coma in the real world so that she can “wake up”.<br />
<br />
This movie is an example of why Sci-fi and romance anime should never mix.<br />
Romance part 8/10 science part 2/10

    I can&#039;t with this movie like seriously. This has got to be my favourite movie of all time. I loved how they put so many plot twists because they are ones that just make your heart clench and aaaaaa I just love the format. To be honest I cried 5 times in this movie because the songs and the art and the story are so moving. At first, the only reason I even went to watch this movie was because I saw that Official Higedandism did an ost for this movie and I loved the song. When I actually went to watch it, I cannot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323156">
        believe how much the song went so well with the movie! I don&#039;t really know if it&#039;s because it made me cry a lot or I was in love with Katagaya but I really recommend it to someone who like fantasy and romance movies.

    I was scrolling through Instagram and found this anime qoutes<br />
&quot;Dating isn&#039;t something you can do alone, shall we do it together?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was confused at first, i thought it was some Sci-Fi anime thats show-off their animating skills using CGI, i was wrong.<br />
FYI: The correct genre was Sci-Fi, Drama, Romance btw.<br />
<br />
Story: 9, Althought the Ending was confusing as hell, after searching so many &quot;theories&quot; about it i found out how&#039;s the Ending explanation.<br />
Without the theories, the stories might&#039;ve ending 7,5-8/10 for mem<br />
<br />
What&#039;s makes it different from other Anime is.. Sci-Fi (except Steins;Gate) travelling back into time using Technologies is an Generic type of story, as long

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336350">
        it&#039;s enjoyable and well-going plot and insane plot-twist inside to story, that&#039;s why i&#039;ll give it an 9.<br />
<br />
Visual/Art: 10<br />
After getting traumatized by so many horibble CGi in anime, i decided to avoid every anime that has CGI in it. (this was exception because the qoutes and popularity after the release of BD version)<br />
But! Tbh i felt lil bit weird seing CGI, without realizing it was &quot;Really-damn-good&quot; and accidently get used to it and ended up liking it. In the end of the movie, it accidently changes into 2D again, which explains something important and meaning behind it. Also, the Director itself was the one who makes SAO Movie, don&#039;t ask me how good everything is in it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The ost named &quot;Nulbarich - Lost Game&quot; sends off an sad emotion into the Music, without this song, i would&#039;ve not cried (yes i did cry, a bit)<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
The character in it are interesting, &quot;what happen if both Introvert loves each other?&quot; concept. The boy MC, Naomi (2027) are &quot;not-so-generic&quot; MC for me i don&#039;t know why some people called it &quot;generic&quot; for some reason.. Well, the relationship between both of them are really interesting, cute, breath-taking, and heart-melting. The 2037 Naomi are kinda annoying tbh, but you&#039;ll see his different side of him which makes me so emotional (cuz the music and his &quot;real&quot; backstory) <br />
THE ROMANCE ARE VERY STRONG, AND SO THE BROMANCE TOO (Old and past Naomi.)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I enjoyed everything in this anime but.. I would&#039;ve give it an 10, just because the story is confusing, i need to find out the explanation to the ending first and watched the spin-off to see watch the hell happen to ending.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9,5/10, oh no whats the hell it should&#039;ve been 10/10!, fine, 10/10.<br />
It exceed my expectation waay to much than i expected, it didn&#039;t deserve the 7,8 score, would&#039;ve been 8,5/10 at least? The society seems to be hating the scriptor works and blaming it here, also, the CGI haters still didn&#039;t really accept the CGI animation in it which makes the anime scores doesn&#039;t makes sense from herr<br />
<br />
I can say it will be currently the best animated CGI anime movie (except for the ending)<br />
<br />
I can sense the retardness of myself, i don&#039;t know what?

    Just amazing and unique anime movie. Beyond imagining.<br />
&quot;I just want to see her smile&quot;<br />
A wonderful movie just loved to watch it.<br />
Everyone should watch it. I recommend it to everyone. Loved it.<br />
:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)<br />
That&#039;s all.  <br />
The characters a bit game-like but the movement.<br />
But the story and the song is amazing.<br />
The story makes you think out of the box hitch you don&quot;t even thought in your dream also.<br />
Perfect deportation of what could be a future world can be.<br />
The first half is interesting than the second half but the action scenes are better in the second half.<br />
Go for it I recommend it.<br />
Have a nice day!!

    “Dating is something that you can’t do alone...let’s try it together, shall we?”<br />
I honestly love this line so much, it provides a different outlook, and seeing Ichigyou get all red after was quite the treat. There were many takeaways from Hello World, and I think the biggest thing for me was that sometimes you’re gonna have to let people go, everybody who is in your life is meant to be apart of your journey, but not all of them are going to stay to the end.<br />
<br />
It’s intriguing to see Ichigyou be mostly unphased, even as she sees her boyfriend literally summon a black hole from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388115">
        her hands. She is placed in a ridiculous predicament, yet she never questions the state she’s in, the world she’s come to know, and Naomi’s incredible power.<br />
 <br />
The ending we received was very eye opening, as we get to see this recreated future with Naomi and Ichigyou on an entirely new world. I am slightly depressed to see Ichigyou’s cuteness diminished over the years.  <br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
Hello World introduces a really unique plot and concept. The story does contain cliches, but the concepts shown throughout are stellar. For whatever reason, animes that alter with timelines are usually really appealing and amazing, this film is no exception. I’m pretty sciency and philosophical, so I really took to the entire idea of the ALLTALE Quantum tech. I thought it was really interesting to see this perspective, where it’s possible to go back and forth with the present and past. Hello World bears similarities to Steins;Gate, as they are both Sci-Fi romances, and introduce some similar concepts. Both are great in their own right, and I really enjoyed both. That plot twist was well…a plot twist, and it was extremely suspenseful and exciting at that. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
Initially you can see the flaws with using C.G.I in the characters, but later it gets unnoticed. It’s understandable, and was necessary for this film to be C.G.I given the objects we would see in the second half of the movie. The characters look very similar to that of Kyoto Animation, and I’m all for it. There were some great examples using C.G.I in this film, like when Naomi starts to alternate universes. Holy, that beautiful rainbow we got treated to in the end was really amazing and beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound design was really god damn good. The application of music and sound effects in their scenes were perfect, especially toward the end. I could download the entire Hello World soundtrack and listen to it on loop. The voice actors were also pretty good, and I felt like they fit the roles really well. Of course their voice acting wasn’t out of this world, but nevertheless they did a good job. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
<br />
All the characters don’t have all that much depth, the most depth we get is in future Naomi. That being said, Naomi and Ichigyou look so good as a couple together. I heavily respect Naomi&#039;s drive to do what he does, and he does a really good job being a mentor to his past self. Naomi’s past self isn’t much of a slouch either, the progression of this Naomi we get to witness is nothing short of impressive. Ruri doesn’t go through much character development, however Ichigyou is stupiddd cute, and she slightly reminds me of Azusa from K-On<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
It’s been quite a while since I felt emotional about anything, and even though that farewell between the Naomi&#039;s was slightly cliche it still felt wholesome and impactful. I’m a big sucker for these school romances, and I thought that the romance in Hello World was really enjoyable. Even though there wasn’t much action, I savored every single moment of it. Not to mention that this was a Sci-Fi Romance, with very interesting theories, ideas and concepts that keep your head turning. With technology and knowledge increasing, it’s interesting to see the various possibilities our world has in the future, just a mere 6 years away. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall, my experience with Hello World was extremely good. The themes that were expressed throughout were meaningful, and I think that’s important when you’re enjoying something. Graphinica killed it with this film, and I cannot wait to watch their other works. There are going to be people who critique, but I think you should definitely give this movie a watch.<br />

    The basic idea for this film had great potential to be an elite-level film, unfortunately this is not what Hello World is. This is not to say it’s bad: Hello World is sort of a hodge-podge of a film that wound up being rather successful despite also being entirely too ambitious. <br />
<br />
In the first five minutes, it becomes clear there is quite a bit more to this film then the synopsis would lead you to believe. The actual basic sci-fi elements are strongly reminiscent of The Matrix. The constant escalation of the action sequences involving those powers is reminiscent of classics like Akira. The idea

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325678">
        of trying to bring a dead loved one back is at this point a trope in anime, but in a sci-fi setting (and in large part thanks to the ending) is most similar to Hal. As if that wasn’t enough, it tries to also be a slice-of-life high-school romcom with bildungsroman elements at times to boot. Although it is not as successful as any of those films artistically, it tries to do so many well-worn plots at once it somehow comes off as fresh and interesting. If I described “Matrix but a high school slife-of-life romance with action-packed battle sequences,” it wouldn’t sound appealing at all, but Hello World somehow pulls it off.<br />
<br />
The plot is rather engrossing overall, but there were definitely times where the hodge-podge nature felt disjointed and overly convoluted. This was particularly true during some of the unimaginative moves during the climatic battle sequences that were startlingly juxtaposed with cliché romance jokes, almost like Evangelion but without a sense of irony. Further, some of the sci-fi elements felt a bit far-fetched and made up on the spot. However, at the end of the day I couldn’t help but enjoy trying to figure out the mysteries of the story as it unfolded, and the final twist left me way more satisfied in the end than I was throughout most of the film. With about twenty seconds left, my thoughts were, “That’s it? That felt like a confused mess?” But the last twenty seconds more than made up for it, tying together some of the most far-fetched sci-fi elements with lines of dialogue at the beginning about the protagonist’s desire to be a more assertive person in a nice, tight bow.<br />
Speaking of the protagaonists, the characters are where this movie becomes a bit more cliché. Naomi is a rather stereotypical lead for both a romance and sci-fi anime: kind of a nerdy virgin who is socially awkward, especially with the opposite sex. It’s nothing special, but I guess characters like that are tropes for a reason because it sort of works. His older self is a bit more interesting given his sense of passion for Ruri. Ruri herself starts out with a strong personality, but she kind of fizzles out into just another forgettable stand in for a love interest towards the end. Most of the other side characters aren’t very important, but the more colorful personalities are hinted at well enough in subtle ways, like the eccentric professor at Keito university.<br />
<br />
However, the area where this film fell most flat was in the animation and directing. Most of the fights felt very disjointed and awkwardly directed, with some rather obnoxiously low flame rates juxtaposed with overly fluid character movements creating an uncanny valley effect. Overall, the animation was riddled with corny-looking CG that was implemented rather poorly. The film had its moments of artistic competence, a lot of the background sets of Kyoto’s cityscape and streets were realistic and evocative (ironically enough, I saw an ad for this in Kyoto tower last month, which is especially funny given the climactic scene of the movie), and the more slice-of-life montages created a sense of character and relationship development very subtly with meaningful repeated transition motifs that were well animated. There was probably one or two music sequences too many, but they were well-directed enough to create a sense of nostalgia for the film. But, overall, the artistic direction felt even more like an incoherent hodge-podge than the plot, but unlike the plot was not tied together with a nice denouement. As a result, it felt more like a TV series with different episodes directed by different studios than a polished feature film in terms of animation.<br />
<br />
Overall, Hello World is nothing overly special like I was hoping for given the high-quality looking adverts and glowing reviews. It’s a perfectly fine film that dabbles in clichés, but spins them together enough to be interesting and with enough unpredictable twists to pique the interests of sci-fi, romance, and action fans alike. Further, the intriguing ending makes it worth the watch alone. If the art direction were a bit more refined and the characters a bit more original, this would’ve been a significantly better film.<br />

Plot: 8/10<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />

    SPOILER FREE REVIEW !!<br />
<br />
holy fucking shit. i did Not expect this movie to be this good. <br />
<br />
i expected nothing from this movie, nothing bad, nothing good. but did it just blew my non existed expectations, and here&#039;s how<br />
<br />
story 7/10: not gonna lie i didn&#039;t understand all the sci-fi shit at all before near the end of the movie and i still dont to be honest but ill just blame that on my empty brain. the story especially the sci-fi elements are interesting, very very much so. nothing ground breaking, its still the classic guy time travels to change something from the past story but they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383752">
        do it well. the pacing and timing of this movie is rly nice. nothing felt rushed, but it didnt feel boring or unimportant too. <br />
<br />
Art 9/10: realising that this was in all cg, i was preparing myself to not judge the visuals too much expecting that it wont work/do well but god was i wrong. never have i Ever seen an anime that looks good in full cg but they did this so well. id go as far to say im glad they made it in cg. the illustrations are beautiful, the cuts, shots, design are all great. its not perfect of course, theres some stuff that they could&#039;ve worked better on but overall its great<br />
<br />
sound 8/10: nothing spectacular but each noise, sound track, and sound effect in this film fits their scenes so well. voice actors did a great job too, nothing super hard but they delivered their lines well, especially the emotional ones.<br />
<br />
characters 7/10: theres nothing to really praise neither critique here. i guess the critique is just that theres nothing really.. special about them. can that be called a critique lol? nothing super well written or any great character growth, but they presented these simple characters well. especially the mc !! i loved how they introduced him. he seems very relatable and just rly nicely presented<br />
<br />
enjoyment 10/10: cant believe im giving a 10/10 honestly but well its true. i enjoyed every second of this movie. probably the first movie where i didnt skip any part, didnt fast forward once and even watched until the very last second of the end credit. <br />
<br />
the movie isn&#039;t anything life changing, its not something special or never done before, its just well made. highly recommend this if you&#039;re bored or just, want something interesting to watch.

    I must&#039;ve been tripping on acid for the last half of this movie because what the hell was *that*? It&#039;s such a shame that the concept wasn&#039;t thought out entirely, or at least, not explained correctly; what I saw in the first half was really promising, so I guess I got my hopes up.<br />
<br />
Okay, well, first I&#039;ll start with art and sound because those two things are the only things I can talk about with any degree of ease. The sound was alright; I mean, I&#039;m not the biggest fan of just using songs over scores as background music for big moments, but the music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336744">
        was still fine. The art was awesome, and I wish that I could deny that it was awesome because I hated the CGI on the characters so much, but it was gorgeous. The character designs were good, the backgrounds were bomb, the lighting was beautiful; that being said, the effects were a bit over the top and annoying and, as I said, I detest animation that&#039;s primarily CGI based. Not to mention the ten minutes of straight what the hell that made me feel like I had taken hallucinogens. I don&#039;t wanna drag on it too much, though, because everything that surrounded the sci-fi stuff-- even if not the sci-fi stuff itself-- was done perfectly.<br />
<br />
Okay, characters. Not as difficult to talk about as the story, but really where do I begin? There were three characters, and really only two considering Naomi is one person, though they are different from one another so maybe it is three. Whatever. They were... fine? Not really any development beyond the bear bones you needed for the story, and honestly, not a whole lot else either? They had their motivations-- or, at least, Naomi did-- and I understood them, but they were still a bit one-dimensional. Naomi did have a bit of growth for both his real and recorded self by the end, so that was good, but yeah.<br />
<br />
The discussion of the story is, obviously, what I dread the most about this review. It&#039;s concept is simple, but the bones of it still had me hooked in the beginning. I will say I didn&#039;t see the twist that comes in the middle, though maybe that&#039;s because the plot developments weren&#039;t built into the story that well. Everything seemed to happen at a really weird pace, and I suppose that was in an effort to propel the story into the second half where it got... weird. Here&#039;s the thing: with the twist the story had, I understand why it went the way it did, but that doesn&#039;t mean the execution wasn&#039;t badly done. Some parts of it, I understood-- the older Naomi&#039;s background, his motives, the steps he took to be where he was. The rest of it was an absolute hot mess. Actually, I&#039;d even say that I understood the plot of the second half-- the problem was that the plot progression and what was happening in the outline of the story made no sense at all. So, sure, I understood what they were telling me was happening but not why those things were written to happen over a potentially better option. The ending, though, actually did make no sense. I didn&#039;t understand it; I tried to, it didn&#039;t track, and I gave up. In theory, I understand the result of the ending but not the ending itself. <br />
<br />
Truly, the beginning of this movie was heartwarming and had the potential to be something lovely. I think if the first half of this film were stretched out to be the majority of the length of the film, keeping the tone and subject the same as it was but just elaborating on existing scenes, it would&#039;ve been a lot more successful. It could&#039;ve ended with the same twist only done much simpler and shorter and without all the extra bits and characters and combat that the original ending had. Just that little tweak could&#039;ve made it so much better and a lot more impactful, but unfortunately, what it ended up being was something that felt half-finished. I still enjoyed it for the most part; for about ten minutes in the middle and ten minutes at the end, I was kind of just staring at the screen, but the rest still captivated me. Would I watch it again? Maybe not, but do I feel like I experienced something special? I think I do, yeah. Do with that what you will and decide for yourself. It isn&#039;t bad at all, the ending just couldn&#039;t quite live up to the setup.

    Hello World. This is a spoiler-free review.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the movie is good but not too good nor too bad. <br />
<br />
Story 6/10:<br />
<br />
Have you ever felt trying to repeat something in the past because you could&#039;ve prevented it? The film shows this feeling exactly the way I wanted it to be. The feeling of wanting to take something back from the past, driven by love, forcing you into harsh experiments just to get it back.  <br />
<br />
In all honestly, the movie is good but not too good nor too bad. <br />
<br />
Why do I say so? It&#039;s simply because the plot wasn&#039;t fully showing us what was happening. Some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321492">
        parts do not make sense because it felt like they were stretching the plot to get to the end. The journey towards the end was really messy. There are a lot of plot holes and unexplained concepts (I won&#039;t go into full detail because of spoilers). The audience were kept being shown different concepts and the movie kept doing so until we reach the end only scratching our heads. At that time the entire cinema audience were asking each other, &quot;What really happened at the end?&quot;, &quot;Why did all of this happen?&quot;. These questions are still yet to remain in our heads due to the lack of explanation and the clarity of the plot.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10:<br />
The use of CG in this film was the main star of the art. The way they used it is like &quot;eye-candy&quot;. There are scenes where rainbow colors would sprout out of something, and honestly it looks really beautiful. The color schemes of each scenes really fit the feel. The orange-red sun shining around the school balcony makes me feel anxious, the bright greens and yellows of the forests makes me feel happy.  Not only that, the reds in some scenes really show an &quot;end of the world&quot; feeling.<br />
<br />
Not only color exceeded my expectations but the amount of flares from bright sources, such as sunlight and lamps, add intensity and a cinematic feel.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10:<br />
The soundtracks felt relevant to the plot. The electronic music plays during something sci-fi happens. Overall the use of music made the scenes feel and sound way better. The sound effects were crisp. Although until now the sound of &quot;monsters&quot; sounded goofy. The voice actor for Ruri Ichigyo sounded as if she had braces on, which was quite irritating and funny to hear at the same time. Although her voice makes her a rememberable character, props to that!<br />
<br />
Characters 6/10:<br />
I gave this part a fair score because the main character, Naomi Katagaki is generic. I immediately already forgot about him and what he did because of &quot;genericness&quot;. He&#039;s the type of guy who follows someone he doesn&#039;t even know and doesn&#039;t expect something to go wrong about that. He&#039;s your typical introvert character from a school setting. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Ruri Ichigyo was an interesting character but not original. The character designs are from Yukiko Horiguchi which gave everyone a &quot;Kyoto Animation&quot; feel. Not only that but the other characters had a cute and fluffy feeling to it I can&#039;t explain. Somewhat a charm given to us by Yukiko Horiguchi, who worked for Kyoto Animation.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10:<br />
The film is enjoyable. It&#039;s worth talking for a while. The only downside on this part is that the messiness of the overall plot makes it less enjoyable. Also some jokes weren&#039;t just funny in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10:<br />
<br />
The show is enjoyable because of the great usage of CG and colors. The sound makes you feel the film through your ears. The plot is quite messy but despite that it&#039;s an okay show.<br />
<br />

    FYI: This is my first ever anime review so there might be some stuff I miss out. <br />
<br />
Firstly, the story is interesting and refreshing. It is not something as generic as weathering with you or Your name. Reading some reviews which have mixed ratings for the ending, I would say it is deeper and require deep understanding. Just note that it requires overthinking to understand the ending and not just with the &quot;oh&quot;. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll divide the art into 2. The artwork itself is beautiful. The way they draw the characters are clear and the contrast works with the Sci-Fi genre. However, the animation or 3D

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321127">
        animation felt very rush. They way they ran, the way it was animated felt odd. <br />
<br />
It is a very subjective matter. In my opinion, I have been spamming the song a lot even before I watched the movie. It suits my taste and it just moves to the groove. Though maybe there is 1 song that I didn&#039;t like, however it felt like the genre is just right for the moment. <br />
<br />
The character design, on the other hand, is unique. The male and female MC could&#039;ve improved a little bit since the voicing felt a bit off from the animation and the situation voice felt weird at times. There is Rie Kugimiya but.. as expected from her I guess. (FYI: when her voice appeared, the fanboy in me... let&#039;s not continue with that). The character&#039;s portrayal is interesting and the way they showed the adult version and young version with their views and struggles are definitely a plus point. <br />
<br />
Also, for those who reviewed as steins;gate carbon copy or time travel genre, it is not and from the start, it was never meant to be a carbon copy. So, please stop with the &quot;time travel&quot; cause it clearly wasn&#039;t meant as an actual time travel anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed it even more so than weathering with you(I watched it twice in the cinema). Some parts felt like they were rushed due to deadlines but the story was covered pretty well and they did not really leave out much details for the audience to overthink it. <br />
Though the ending does gives you the need to over assume how and why it happened.

Hello world is a movie I did not have much high hopes for. Mainly because of how its all 3D animated and sci-fi romance isn&#039;t really my type. What got me into watching this movie was because the trailer claimed that it was from the same company that made Weathering With You and Your Name and you know damn well how great those movies are so I had to give this one a chance.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start off with the the pros of the movie<br />
<br />
The biggest point I can personally think of after watching Hello World was the animation, art and the soundtrack.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321079">
        Despite the whole movie being CGI, they did such a great job with it that I first thought to myself, &quot;Am I really watching a 3D anime?&quot;. The scenes were very crisp and did not look choppy at all, the animation looked realistic and the art made it really seem like a 2D animated movie. The soundtracks also complimented the scenes very well, when an action is happening, the soundtrack playing makes you really pumped. When some romantic scenes happens, there&#039;s a piano track to suit the scene. Honestly, these points are all the great points I also thought about after watching Weathering With You and Your Name.<br />
<br />
Now for the cons of the movie<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll have to say the weakest point of the movie are the characters and the story. I personally like the character designs of the movie (kinda like Shinkai&#039;s works where the main characters dont stand out too much from the rest of the cast) but it lacked in character depth(?) should I say so myself. Ichigyo Ruri is definitely my favorite from the cast but damn she had no backstory at all! (or idk maybe i was dozing off when that happened lol) I felt like they could have done more to Ichigyo to make her more interesting like telling her backstory or at least giving the reason why Naomi liked her in the first place. The story was way too focused on the two main cast which are both the same characters but from different timelines just trying to get Ichigyo to like him. Aside that the story gets more confusing the longer it went especially the ending which I&#039;m not going to spoil, what I&#039;m just going to say is that the ending felt so much like Fireworks. Pure confusion.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this movie an 8/10 rating. The movie was very enjoyable and had an unexpected twists, I honestly didn&#039;t expect this much action but I liked it actually. The art, animation and OST is really amazing but it kinda lacked in character depth and story. I do recommend watching this if you are a fan of Shinkai&#039;s work as it had just as eye-catching scenes.<br />

    Oh boi! I just finished watching this movie earlier and i have a lot of things i want to say about this Anime but first of all i want to say that this movie exceeded my expectations. when i first saw the movie trailer and at the same time knew that it was the same company who makes the movie Kimi No Na Wa and Weathering with you possible (by all means, i&#039;m fully aware that Hello World was not created by the same author as the 2 anime i mentioned above which is created by makoto shinkai), i admittedly expecting it to have an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321003">
        open ending but it i was mistaken, So without further a do this is my full review about Hello World<br />
<br />
Story: I wont bother telling the summary cause you can read it here on MAL. So for starters the story was pretty interesting(Note: i read some part of the source material ,so i have a vague idea of what will happened in the story), The Story revolves around a certain boy who&#039;s so indecisive and a girl who has strong personality, sooner and later they became friends and the story moves with this development. The Anime has a concept of time travel(Technically), A Big Bang(yep your reading it correctly) and a romance/comedy( yup this going to be a sweet vanilla sugar story so if you a have high blood sugar then.... nah watch it anyways, its worth it!). What i love about this movie is they ended it with a conclusion(no left hanging and no plot holes) Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Art: What should i say about this? The art and the animation won&#039;t disappoint you. Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound: OH my goodness should i mention that i&#039;m listening to the song while writing this review(yup i definitely should and already did it) cause that&#039;s how good the songs and soundtracks they put in this Anime. Score 10/10<br />
<br />
Character: I think i found a new waifu &lt;3 aside from new waifu the character development of each main characters was notable and amazing. Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Oh boi I enjoyed this movie so much and i really think that this movie was far superior compared to Kimi No Na Wa and Weathering With you(At least for me). Score : 10/10 would rewatch this definitely.<br />
<br />
Overall: if you read my review there&#039;s nothing much to say Here aside from one world to describe the Anime Movie and that it is a &quot;MASTERPIECE&quot; Score:11/10

    (NOTE: I&#039;m a slice of life fan so I am very particular with emotions. This review is ONLY my perspective.)<br />
<br />
Okay, the movie is &quot;okay&quot;. There are a lot of things to discussed on why I rated it 6 and why I think this could be better if it&#039;s a series. <br />
<br />
First, the phasing is &quot;fine&quot; and the music is &quot;good&quot;. It was slightly overloaded with information but you can still keep up with it. I love most of the music, but some are a bit off especially when they&#039;re trying to move on to another phase.<br />
<br />
Second, the characters lack emotions. Now this is very crucial

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339265">
        for me since this would bring an overall impression for the whole movie. Although it&#039;s easy to read their feelings, it&#039;s very hard to empathize with them. In short, there&#039;s a &quot;detachment&quot; going on while watching the show. I guess phasing is also one of the factors why I felt like it. But the main factor is they&#039;re not just prioritizing their emotions and I would say the movie is overwhelmed with its &quot;sci-fi&quot; element. <br />
<br />
Third, poor voice acting. This is also one of the factors why I felt so detached with the characters and the story. I just couldn&#039;t feel it. There&#039;s something wrong with their portrayal and I guess they really didn&#039;t just give enough importance to it. With that simple personality the MC have, they could have done more with his voice because it is &quot;generic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fourth, this is a CG Anime. Now I would say it&#039;s not a bad attempt to have it as CG type of a show. The animation and action is actually pretty good. But personally, I&#039;m not just use to watch an anime with a &quot;video game&quot; type of look. I guess there&#039;s just that sense of &quot;normalcy&quot; I&#039;m looking for. I&#039;m not saying that it&#039;s bad, it&#039;s actually a beautiful art and I appreciate how they actually did it because they did explore a different approach on an anime film. <br />
<br />
Fifth, the unexpected ending was great. I could not tell you the details to avoid spoilers but it surely is mind-blowing. I got a lot of questions while watching the movie like &quot;Who&#039;s that lame crow who can talk?&quot;, but that ending answered some of them and that scene alone gave justice to the film. <br />
<br />
Sixth, we all know that quantum theory is a very complex topic. That&#039;s why it&#039;s very hard to condensed it in tiny bits of information, especially when it should not be the focus of the story. But I guess sci-fi fans has no issue on it at all since the concept was used a lot of times already. I only encountered quantum theory in Marvel and DC films plus the mobile online game that I&#039;ve kept on playing. With that said, do I lack the knowledge? Or it&#039;s just very complex that I should get over with it and have fun watching the movie without giving it a care unless I want to be a scientist? (LOL)<br />
<br />
Last but not the least, it would be better if this was made as a series. If this was made like 24 episodes long, all the issues that I&#039;ve stated would probably be solved. Characters with backstories to support their emotions, phasing is way better, and quantum theory is supported with a lot of important information for it to go along with the story. Plus the viewers would appreciate  the couple ship more and they should be able to empathize with the characters.<br />
<br />
I find the concept and story interesting with a lots of drawbacks. This anime movie could go on par with &quot;Your Name&quot; if it was done better. Despite all the issues, the potential of this film could still inspire people in many ways, and that alone is enough for me to be convinced that it is worth watching.<br />
