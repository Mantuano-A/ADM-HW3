    First of all things do not get fooled by the low score that this show has on mal, it should be over 8. Second don&#039;t believe those rumors about this show being bland or boring I assure that&#039;s not the case at all, this anime is great from the first minute of episode one and filled with great stuff until the end. Finally read what i wrote in this review if you are planning to watch this show and you are hesitant about some stuff.<br />
<br />
Shoukoku no Altair takes a different approach on the hystorical battle/war anime  and portrays what happens behind the stage (battle).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266019">
        It focuses on evidentiating the gains, merits ,profits and interests that each participating side will gain from the war. It also shows the preparations and different strategies used that at first glance don&#039;t seem big but have bigger influence later in deciding the winner and loser. <br />
This show takes things like economics and trading to a whole new level and display their meaning and influence on the war stage. <br />
<br />
The characters are great and manage to shine on the war stage with their cunning strategies and good decisions .Their development is fantastic across this anime , they know how to use their own strenght as a weapon and grow after each battle learning from their defeats and wins. They also don&#039;t mind taking risks and thus making this show more exiciting to watch.Keep in mind that most of them use their mind more than their brute force but still manage to create something captivating.<br />
<br />
Although the main focus are not the battles I gotta say that the tactics used in each one of them gave me a bump of adrenaline . The clash of ideals , ambitions and wits together with their innovative and creative strategies made this show unique and enjoyable. Choosing your right words for your speech can motivate or demoralize an army but can also give you benefits in forming an alliance and influence the course of the war.<br />
<br />
This show in conclusion displays a brilliant presentation of what happens behind the stage of war , the profits and interest gained by each country and also how the character&#039;s decisions and strategies influence the course of war thus the hystory itself. Fantastic! A gem that is hidden behind an low overall mal score which deserves more attention and love!

    Shoukoku no Altair is a historical fiction centered around the young Mahmut Tuğrul as he struggles with his desires for peace while simultaneously having to get himself deeper in the war that is raging between the two major powers of the Türkiye Stratocracy and the Balt-Rhein Empire. My general opinion of the anime is that it is a fantastic take on this particular type of show where politics, war &amp; war tactics are at the forefront of the show&#039;s focus. Also I think that the show is criminally underrated if I&#039;m being honest. Most of the criticisms of the show I&#039;ve heard of were mostly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266080">
        pertaining to the show&#039;s pacing so keep that in mind if you are looking to get into Shoukoku no Altair.<br />
I thought the story for Shoukoku no Altair was outstanding. The premise is similar to some shows that have come before it but the way everything was executed, was interesting. I especially liked how the politics of the show was handled and how it connected well with the war aspect, whether it be with the two major powers or the many smaller nations/empires involved.<br />
The art and animation were nice and clean. It was nothing spectacular but at the same time it was above average. The soundtrack for Shoukoku no Altair was great and I thought it fit really well with the tone as well as the general setting of the show.<br />
The characters of the show is probably it&#039;s weakest point. It&#039;s fun to see the dichotomy of Mahmut Tuğrul&#039;s character. A pacifist that often has to lead the frontlines of battle and has to take responsibility for the lives of many. The supporting cast around Mahmut as well as the antagonists are good in their own right, it&#039;s just that there isn&#039;t any deep characterization to be found from them in my opinion.<br />
Shoukoku no Altair was enjoyable from the first episode to the last through its various arcs. It took some things that I like from its genre and went a bit deeper with it and I think the show was well done overall. I highly recommend you give this an anime a watch.

    What makes this anime must watch of this year , well first of all the genres are Adventure , historical and shounene and after completing this series today i would say its not a disappointing anime at all , it overcome my expectation and become one of my fav of this year.<br />
<br />
Well this is the most underrated anime of 2017.Yes the hidden gem.Mostly people forget about this anime/drop this anime after watching 1 or 2 episodes coz start was little weak but now after this , this series start to grow much much better.<br />
And as you can see at start the ratting of this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266079">
        was 6 point something but now this series is over you can see its ratting starts to grow.You can say those who continue to watch this must got something from this anime and this anime make me it fan.<br />
You have lots of action , strategies that will impress you so much.And MC (Mahmut) is not a losser type of.He is a badass like a boss type character who is trying to achieve his goals as to stop war at all costs.Cool economical stratigies difenatly will make you say its awesome.<br />
<br />
(First of all Before you decided to drop this series after watching 1 or 2 episodes i personally recommend you that you should watch atleast 5 or 6 episodes.Thats the advice you need.<br />
Dont give a look at score like i told at up that its a underrated anime.)<br />
And those who are only ecchi anime fans i would say this review is not for them.<br />
This series is like Arslan senki but not that much.<br />
<br />
And please ignore that dancer Shahra , she maybe makes you hate this anime but ignore , she will be in start only , hehe.<br />
<br />
Our MC is a pashs (Pasha = an army rank of that country).Little Spoiler below<br />
We have a cool MC who is pasha when he was a kid his village got burned into ashes because of war and he was the sole survival in his village.He got adopted by another pasha. The MC made his goal to stop something like that in future so he become a pasha of his nation , the youngest pasha.But sadly he got demoted when the empire attack a province of torkiye and he did not give value to his job and stop the enemy without considering his job.So another pasha add him into his spy network and thus his journey begin to find more knowledge and more about people and nations.Their he find other spies and journey keeps going on.I can tell much becoz further will coz spoilers.But i tell you his companion Abriga is so badass.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
9/10<br />
I enjoyed while watching this anime.The anime is full with action and strategies.And MC is full with action and strategies that will impress you.First arc is 8/10 and the secound  arc is masterpiece 10/10.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
i enjoyed this alot and its keep getting batter after each episode.<br />
I will say you should give a try and its worth.If you are too much religious then this review cant be helpful.But as an otaku its worth.Hope you liked it.<br />
Sorry for bad english.<br />

    I don&#039;t understand why this show has such a low ranking and review score on MAL. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not the most epic show ever, but it&#039;s an interesting take on a pretty generic concept: the main character who with a tragic past tries to stop warring nations with one applying more nefarious actions to achieve their goals, usually to capture more land and take over more countries. The setting is now in fictional interpreted historical Türkiye and the main character is a Pasha with an eagle counterpart. So as an avid anime watcher it&#039;s a good show to relax and watch. Of course many are probably

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257636">
        more critical than me, but sometimes you need to just ease up and enjoy what a show does well with instead or else you begin to find little enjoyment in watching anime anymore. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not on par with huge popular shows playing right now like My Hero Academia, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s any less enjoyable. It&#039;s a slow burning start, but it sets up an interesting political system and society as well as establishing the beginnings of the characters. <br />
<br />
Just because the studio isn&#039;t releasing a new season of YOI doesn&#039;t mean this show is bad. Yes it needs work, like most shows. But I think this is a show with good potential, if it were to get a higher budget and could take a longer time to plan out and animate everything, then I think this show could achieve even better results. <br />
<br />
Overall, watch this show, it&#039;s good, the MAL ranking and stars don&#039;t serve it justice. I hope MAPPA releases another season should this first season only release 12 episodes. <br />
<br />
Please support this show!

    I’m a sucker for historical-based fantasy, so Altair should’ve been the highlight of the year - but it ended up falling flat. While it did some interesting things, it ran into speed bumps that shows why anime rarely attempts epic scale fantasy stories. <br />
<br />
The political in Altair interplay is on a level most anime don’t come near touching. The countries all feel unique and like a good deal of thought went behind their creation. The leaders and military commanders have refreshingly realistic stances that usually make sense and don’t feel like they were contrived to create drama or follow an oversimplified black/white, good/evil paradigm. However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266113">
        a lot of the details get lost in the mix. <br />
<br />
Altair moves at a breakneck pace. Sometimes, it feels like you’re meeting a full new cast of characters every episode. The nuanced political play ends up getting lost in a sea of strange names and terms that frustrates the viewer.  <br />
<br />
Because the details are there. <br />
<br />
This show isn’t about flash and bombastic moments, filled with borderline illogical plots in order to satisfy the “rule of cool.” There’s real thought behind everything that happens, but it moves way too fast to pick up on everything. Often, you end up feeling lost and only seeing the surface-level of the story. <br />
<br />
The pace ends up hurting the characters too. Supporting characters start blending together because there’s just too many of them and not enough time to differentiate them. Even the characters that show up in the majority of the episodes don’t get the chance to develop because they’re too busy jumping from one country to the next. <br />
<br />
Altair could greatly benefit from a few scenes where characters just sit around drinking and having fun rather than always being in the middle of a political discussion or battlefield. Because I want to care about them, but it’s hard too when the anime never attempts to make an emotional connection with the viewer. <br />
<br />
The animation itself leaves something to be desired. While the cities and clothing are varied by country, the animation can’t keep up and often skimps on details. Likewise, fight scenes usually fall flat for the same reason. <br />
<br />
You still have to appreciate what Altair attempted. If doubled the number of episodes, or halved the content covered, Altair would’ve been a masterpiece. Every single country visited is rich in detail with the occasional Easter egg is thrown in to the delight of history fans like myself. Leadership and countries getting portrayed in mostly grey-and-grey morality is a refreshing and change from the notion of simple “good” and “bad.” And when the anime does slow down or spends more than two episodes on a conflict, the end result is highly engaging despite the lackluster emotional connection to the cast. <br />
<br />
I haven’t read the manga, so I can’t confirm this, but I highly suspect this is a case of a poor adaptation of great content and that Altair will go down like Kingdom - skip the anime and read the far superior manga instead. <br />
<br />
If you’re looking for anime that rely on detailed storytelling rather than flash and fanservice, then you might enjoy Altair. Sadly, the details fall through the cracks thanks to pacing issues that also end up hurting the characters. <br />

Altaïr is a shonen that made me crave for a while!<br />
Kotono Kato takes us here in a fantastic universe that is reminiscent of the Ottoman Empire and the Mediterranean basin. Mahmut is a young Pasha who will find himself involved in conflicts that could plunge the Türkiye Empire into chaos. It will then be up to him to thwart the most terrible plots.

    I am just writing this review because the rating is really low for what it actually is. Don&#039;t look at the 6.7 overall rating (at this time 15/10/2017) it is actually really good. Gave it a ten, because of the low rating, actual would be an overall 8.1.<br />
<br />
The story is inspired by the time of the ottomans. It&#039;s though not in the form of depicting real history, but it&#039;s own.

        good job in researching the language. haven&#039;t seen the full anime yet, but would give I an 8.6 rating for its story. (Now that I have it&#039;s an 8.4)<br />
<br />
The art style I would give an 8.2. It&#039;s very good and simple.<br />
<br />
The sound is alright, not amazing, but good. The music in some places can make your emotions come out a little, even if you don&#039;t want it. 7.4<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t also say the character is amazing, but they are very diverse of how they act and fell to the story. 7.6<br />
<br />
I have enjoyed this more than any other in these past months. So a 8.7 for the enjoyment. (well for me at least)<br />
<br />
Actually, when I think about it, this is my first review. huh? never thought this would happen.<br />
(Just came back for minor edits since the rating has gone up, as it deserves)

    I greatly detested this series, so maybe this review will help people to understand why some watchers may not like it. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, because I analysed plot turns and characters&#039; motivation in detail here.  I was really indignant by all the injustice and inconsistency I saw in this series, so I tried to minutely expound arguments against it. <br />
<br />
I’ve seen many mary sue characters, but not a single one of them came even close to the MC of Altair. Mahmut is not only a mary sue, he is like the worst and cheapest collection of possible cliches the main character could be.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267353">
        Before reading Altair I thought that such type of a character could be possible only in bad fanfiction about the all-powerful author&#039;s self-insert. But to make the entire series around such type of ‘hero’ is definitely a new low. He actually reminds me of shoujo heroines. Those girls that do nothing in particular, but have all the handsome boys they meet in anime/manga fall for them for no reason. You can see exactly this pattern in Altair, only instead of handsome guys the whole countries and their rulers fall for Mahmut when he comes there. So, so much nonsense in this anime, I don’t even know where to start.<br />
<br />
I think the first moment which left a bad impression of MC as a shameless mary sue was when he fought with a professional assassin in the beginning of the series and won easily. But it was nothing compared to what convenient plot twists he and his beloved Turkiye got in the future. What I noted firstly, Mahmut is not some shounen MC with special abilities. There is no magic in his world. That means author can’t simply justify his winnings against stronger, older and more experienced opponents just because he is a chosen one and awakened some kind of special power. He doesn’t have it. That means he wins against all those smarter and more powerful men and outsmarts them only because he is some kind of genius teenager. That’s already a big stretch that seems absolutely unrealistic, or rather even goes against a common sense. He doesn’t even have a physical strength to fight against a professional soldier if you look at his complexion. How did he manage to fight evenly against Glalat for example? He doesn’t have any kind of magic ability, so how can you explain it? Only thanks to plot shield.<br />
<br />
But there is also an awful nonsense concerning his country and their side in war as a ‘good guys’. I’ve never detested any fantasy country as much as I detest Turkiye in this anime. I was left in a deep shock after the arc about Balaban, which perfectly demonstrated all the incredible hypocrisy concerning Turkiye and their way of settling matters. I can tell you how it looks from the side of someone who doesn’t care about cute Mahmut and pairings with him. The whole arc tells us how one country, Turkiye, wanted to establish its dominance in the region and for that reason subjugated the neighboring countries and deprived them of their independence. They did it by arranging a conspiracy with traitorous relatives of the rulers of said countries. Those relatives then proceeded to murder their own kin only because they didn’t want to submit to Turkiye. Turkiye here is an obvious evil in my eyes. Are you against independence and self-determination of nations? Do you support dictatorship? Because Turkiye was acting like a typical dictatorial state here.<br />
<br />
To implement their plan Turkiye ordered Mahmut to arrange assassinations of the leaders who didn’t want their countries to become a part of Turkiye and give up their independence. Now remind me, why on earth we must support Turkiye here? Only because the MC is on its side? So, not only Mahmut with the renegades from the royal families murdered Balaban and other ‘rebellious’ rulers, they also straight out brainwashed ordinary citizens with a propagandist plays. They even said directly that they need to make people support them and deceive them somehow, because people obviously wouldn’t endorse some bunch of murderers who annex their country. Now, what were Balaban’s intentions and those other sultans who joined him? He wanted an equal rights for his country with Turkiye. An equal rights, that’s all. He didn’t want to conquer Turkiye. He wanted his country to be free from it. He also wanted to make a trade treaties with Baltrhein empire, because it was more profitable for his country than their dependent condition under Turkiye’s authority. And you know what, the author doesn’t even try to cover this up or challenge Balaban’s reasoning.<br />
<br />
What shocked me the most is how Balaban’s brother justified his betrayal. He said, okay, our country would become rich and prosperous if we had independence and can make treaties with Baltrhein. He admitted it. But he thought that if they become rich some other country would try to attack them. So, making your own country prosper is bad by that logic. What is this I don’t even– Firstly, a rich country can hire an army to protect itself. And their country was already under attack from Turkiye even without the riches. So, this faulty logic just doesn’t work at all! Then why doesn’t the author claim that Venedik is also wrong in becoming rich due to the sea trade? Or is it okay for them because they became allies with Turkiye? If you sided with Turkiye that makes you ‘the good guys’ by default, and if you just don’t want to side with it - that makes you a villain and you need to be murdered. How Baltrhein are the bad guys here? It weren’t them who tried to conquer Balaban’s country. They wanted to trade with it. And Turkiye wanted to subdue all the neighboring territories and annex them.<br />
<br />
Another reasoning which Balaban’s brother gave while murdering him, was that sometime in the future his decision to ally with Baltrhein will prove to be actually wrong. That’s it. He somehow knows, or feels, or maybe he can see the future, that the alliance with Baltrhein will be bad for their country and Turkiye’s dictatorship will be good. He - and the author - couldn’t even came up with the reason why is that, they just know. Perfect argumentation here, isn’t it? And because of that nonsense he murdered his brother and gave his country to Turkiye. And Mahmut had a nerve to make a sad face and whine that he is sorry for the blood was spilled. Really now, it wasn’t just spilled. Mahmut spilled it by organizing the assassinations and straight out attacking Balaban’s country. How on earth am I supposed to cheer for this absolutely evil and hypocritical MC and his tyrannical country with a bunch of dirty traitors who killed their relatives for the sake of it?<br />
<br />
For his great achievements in annexation and murders Mahmut has been promoted again and became a minister of foreign affairs. Because really, there are no other candidate in the whole Turkiye who suits the role better than a 17 years old mary sue. Mahmut begins his tour around Europe and almost every country he visits gladly unites with Turkiye even if they didn’t want to be dragged into the war with Baltrhein before. I’m talking about Venedik primarily. I was left speechless from that kind of nonsense, just enjoy the ‘logic’ here. So, Lucio, the ruler of Venedik, has stated very clearly that he didn’t want his country to take part in any conflict. Then Mahmut dragged Venedik into the war against Baltrhein by deceit. He used their ships in one of his ‘genius’ machinations and after that Venedik had no choice but to fight Baltrhein because empire considered them enemies from that point. What was Lucio’s reaction? Maybe he became angry at Mahmut and Turkiye? Or tried to contact empire and reestablish his country’s policy as non-interference? No, he praised Mahmut for pushing his country into the war by deceit. And why is that? Because Mahmut just did it so smartly. Okay, yeah, he smartly dragged your country into the war while you tried to maintain peace in it. That’s certainly a reason to praise someone and to make alliance with this deceiver. Because now you trust him, right? What is this? I can&#039;t take this motivation seriously. It’s unbelievable how the author twists logic and common sense to make everything go into Mahmut’s favor.<br />
<br />
Another great nonsense that pissed me off happened when even not-Romania of all countries decided to make an alliance with Turkiye. And as always the author pretended that there were some ‘difficulties’ for Mahmut because at first not-Dracula refused to cooperate with Turks. But of course it was solely a cheap plot pretense. Literally a couple of chapters in manga after he ‘firmly’ refused to make a deal with Turkiye he changed his mind. No one can resist our little mary sue. The reason for his change of mind was another ‘genius’ idea Mahmut had that not-Romania can become rich by selling bird’s crap. What a story. Firstly, there was no reason at all for that country to close its borders. If its ruler didn’t open them and started to trade with other countries even when his people began to die from hunger, he is just a degenerate and a tyrant. There is simply no justification for this, it’s just tyranny. But the author tried to present this man as a troubled person who just didn’t know what to do. This reasoning didn’t work at all. Nothing was stopping not-Romania from trading with other countries apart from its ruler’s stupidity and stubbornness. Mahmut wasn’t some kind of genius savior of their nation because they didn’t need his plan in the first place. They even had Baltrhein ambassador that made them a trade offer. Guess what did they choose? Of course they chose Mahmut with his bird’s crap and executed the empire’s ambassador. Even though not-Romania also didn’t want to be dragged into the war and their fear of wars was exactly the reason for closing borders in the past. Guess they just stopped caring and decided to provoke Baltrhein and show aggression to them first. For no reason at all. <br />
<br />
Actually what makes all this worse besides Turkiye and Mahmut’s hypocrisy about ‘not wanting to start a war’ while conquering another countries and organizing a war alliance, is that cheap false pretense when some countries sort of don’t want to unite with Turkiye but then immediately change their decision. Author obviously use this primitive plot device to create a false sense of ‘troubles’ Mahmut has on his way. But they are not real troubles. Because every freaking time everything goes in his favor in end. Another example of this being the case with Florence. Again its ruler at first refused to let Turkiye’s army pass. But literally in the next episode she not only let them pass but joined their alliance. Who does the author try to deceive here with these forced difficulties which are solved by the convenient plot every time? In case of Florence this county had especially good reason to refuse Turkiye&#039;s proposal because Turkiye invaded them in the past. So all other ministers were against the alliance with such barbarians and rightfully so. Of course they were presented as some kind of evil or narrow-minded people. In this story if you don’t like Turkiye and Mahmut you are the bad guy by default, don’t forget. Even if you have perfectly good reasons for hating them, you must forget the past and work with them now. By the very convenient coincidence Florence ruler just happened to be Suleyman’s lover. Because of that she didn’t give a heck about her country’s safety or its citizens opinion. She was ready to do anything her lover asked and was just waiting for the pretext to act. And the author gave us that pretext.<br />
<br />
Of course it was stupid to expect that in such kind of story there will be two sides of conflict with their own truth. There can be no other right side besides Mahmut and Turkiye. So Baltrhein is presented here as cliche bag guys who are ‘evil’ just because. Seriously, they were given no reasoning for their actions. Moreover they even have some parallels with nazis, for god’s sake. Can you get any lower and more cheesy with your bad guys portrayal? Like ambassador’s quasi-nazi uniform with the freaking armband. In the middle ages. I actually laughed when I saw it first. And almost all Baltrhein officers are blonde. Seriously, it feels like the author has something personal against Europe. Their motivation in this war is as vague and unconvincing as it could be. At first author stated that Baltrhein wants to expand empire borders because they need more taxes from the conquered lands. Then Louis said something like that empire needs to grow or it would stop existing. What? Again, nothing definite, just some vague phrases that make no sense. Why would it stop existing without war? No answer. It just would. Author can’t give them better motivation. Okay, in case with taxes it was at least some kind of argumentation. But what are their soldiers doing? They are not just conquering new lands and imposing taxes on them. No, they completely destroy and burn down the entire cities. Excuse me, but who would pay taxes if you burn down their fields and cities and kill all the citizens? It makes no sense. And I’m not blaming Baltrhein for that. I’m blaming the author because she imposed on them this plot induced stupidity so they would look like cartoony bad guys. She couldn’t came up with a convincing motive for them to burn down and ruin countries when they supposedly want to profit from these lands. Baltrhein just needs to play the role of token bad guys that the hero Mahmut could defeat.<br />
<br />
So when Baltein took another city (and didn’t even kill its citizens this time, just asked them for cooperation), Florence’s ruler used this as an excuse to make alliance with Mahmut, as if something unthinkable has happened that immediately crossed out their long lasting feud with Turkiye. But nothing of sort has happened if you think about it. She wanted to create her own alliance with neighboring countries at first and literally nothing has changed since that moment. She knew from the start that Baltreain is trying to expand its influence and waging war. But as I said she just wanted a pretext to do a favor for her lover. What a ‘good’ ruler she is and what another convenient development for Mahmut. Also there was this extremely cheap and trite scene when she was saved literally in the last moment by Suleyman from ‘evil’ ministers who were against alliance with Turkiye. I think I haven’t seen this kind of lazy script with banal ‘save lady in distress in the last second’ scene for years.<br />
<br />
After that Mahmut gained another ally by winning in their siege cosplay. That was just facepalm inducing. What a great way to decide your country’s future and its side in the war. Of course this teenage genius leads an army more professional than experienced generals and leaves everyone in awe, so his victory wasn’t even a question. This story is just Mahmut fanservice galore.<br />
<br />
But as every mary sue Mahmut needed a reason for wanting a revenge. He can’t kill his enemies mercilessly just because, author can’t make him dirty his hands, he needs a justification for that. So she killed his mentor and that was I think the only battle in the whole story when Baltrhein won against Turks. Of course it was the most banal and predictable plot turn, I wanna see a single person who didn’t expect it. Author can never kill any of Mahmut’s friends, they are invincible, but she can kill off useless background character who is also not a bishounen, so it won’t hurt her ratings. This ‘old mentor death that gives hero a reason for revenge’ is one of the most used cliches ever. Nothing original here as always.<br />
<br />
Of course Baltrhein very soon paid for that and Mahmut smashed their army with his tactical genius. The role of ‘tactics in this case played his freaking magical bird who apparently can understand human speech and even read thoughts. How else would you explain this eagle understanding and executing Mahmut’s very particular orders? It’s like an incarnation of deus ex machina in this story. Mahmut himself apparently can read minds too, because he was able to predict not only the place where Baltrhein’s army would attack them, which would have been at least believable. No, he even predicted the specific moment of their attack and providently managed to gather his allies at the exact same moment in the exact same place so they could surround empire’s forces. The end of this was of course predictable, you should know who won even if you haven’t watched this series and just read this review. The supposedly professional, experienced and smart officers (or how else were they able to conquer many countries if they they don’t have such qualities?) or a genius teenager? The answer is obvious.<br />
<br />
The so-called battle in the last episodes was just shameless and idiotic Turkiye fanservice. Every Turk soldier suddenly turned into superman and every empire’s soldier forget how to fight and turned into dummy, so that it would be easier for Turks and their allies to kill them all with one-shot strikes. At the same time the fearful empire forces were unable to even wound Turkiye’s mob soldiers. Even their officers - they all died in a moment, like they were a newbies on the battlefield and not a seasoned military leaders. I also must mention some truly fantastic plot devices that helped Turkiye‘s alliance to win, like their cavalry breaking freaking trebuchets in a second. Say what? Their horses couldn’t physically do it, they should have been wounded from running into the trebuchets which were like three times bigger then them. There were also a deep moats that some local miners apparently were able to dig out overnight all around the perimeter of the battlefield. Of course Balthrein’s soldiers didn’t look under their feet and just fell into it. What a storytelling. Also some group of bandits who were left to defend the fortress from the empire got a sudden reinforcement with the 10,000 soldiers. Where did they hire a literal army in such a short time? Actually I wondered only one thing after seeing all of this nonsense - how on earth could imperial forces conquer so many countries and get a reputation of formidable army if they performed so poorly in this battle? It made an impression that they literally couldn’t fight, with such ease they were killed, even the supposedly intelligent officers. How? Am I the only one who see a huge contradiction in these characters’ portrayal? Or they forget how to fight only against mary sue forces when it was time for Mahmut to shine?<br />
<br />
Naturally the author made Baltrhein’s leading general Pino as unattractive as possible in contradiction to Turkiye’s bishounen leaders. Because you just can’t allow your watchers to chose which side to root for. You need to make enemies of your mary sue MC graceless so the watcher won’t even have a second thought who they need to support. It’s worth mentioning thought that there are two attractive characters on Baltrhein’s side, Glalat and Simon. But it doesn’t change anything - Turkiye’s alliance has much more bishounen so empire can’t compete with it.<br />
<br />
There was one more forced victim on the allies’ side besides mc’s mentor which was made solely to show that war kind of hurts the alliance too. Expect author still didn’t have courage to kill any established and important characters, so she added a new likable character at first, who of course immediately agreed to help Mahmut, and then killed him off in the most idiotic and far-fetched way. I’m talking about the director Carvajal of the Republic of Chielo of course. The all-powerful Abiriga who was able to move as a spiderman and have saved Mahmut many times before with his abilities, lingered for no freaking reason until it was too late to help Carvajal. If there was Mahmunt in his place, Abiriga would have climbed that wall a long time ago. But author intentionally made him linger, when he just froze and waited while other characters were talking, missing precious time. She also induced stupidity on all Mahmut’s friends when they were searching for Carvajal in a hurry, but still found some time to stop and have a chat. Carvajal’s execution was so obviously forced plot-wise, it’s not even funny. That&#039;s just the lowest tier writing. Sad, but at the same time infuriating because Carvajal played the role of the blatant plot device. He was added into this story only to get killed later to show this farce ‘tragedy’. Very cheap manipulation with a newly added character created specifically for this purpose.<br />
<br />
So why did the author killed off Carvajal, what was his role in this plot? There was a reason, it was done so Mahmut would have a pretext to annex Chielo after that and establish Turkiye’s authority there. Yeah, they subjugated a free country again and they are still supposed to be ‘the good guys’ while whining about terrible empire that will conquer them so they are just acting on the defense. It’s just laughable at this point with all this hypocrisy. Turkiye has been ‘defending’ itself by annexing its neighboring countries, organizing a military alliance, forcing countries into this alliance if they didn’t want to participate by deceiving them, with nonsensical reasoning or with blatant threats. And now it&#039;s subjugating even other European countries and forcing its rule there. Who is the horrible conqueror here again? Apparently Florence ministers were right when they wanted to protect their country from Turkiye and not from Baltrhein. From the manga we know that later on Mahmut will lead Turkiye’s army right under the walls of the Mont Saint Michel. Apparently they are still ‘defending’ themselves in this way, by attacking and besieging empire’s capital first. Nice defense here. And all of this while Baltrhein has been burning down some random cities (for no reason, cause they wouldn’t be able to even gather taxes from them after that). By the way, Baltrhein is supposed to be an empire, but it has almost no allies. Where are the armies of all those countries that the empire is composed of? There are none. Is it even empire at all? It looks to me that Baltrhein is just one country with no allies, because all other European countries decided to unite with Turkiye against it. Funny that they couldn’t even make some kind of alliance by themselves if Baltrhein was really acting aggressive. No, only the bright 17-years old hero Mahmut was able to unite the Europe. What would all those incompetent rulers and generals do without him and Turkiye? Needless to say, this is the most logically distorted, disgusting and stupid story I’ve ever seen.

    I&#039;m going to say this right off the bat. I am genuinely surprised that that ratings on MAL are this low. But perhaps that maybe because of the unique approach this particular anime has taken. Starting off, the very short review:<br />
<br />
Should you watch it? Yep. *pushes you out the door* Go. Right now. I regard this one to be among the best animes I&#039;ve watched this year. What makes this one so unique compared to the others? Its the politics. Characters are bloody amazing, there&#039;s a lot of cloak and dagger play going on, strings being pulled.. Its not easy to pull off something like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266510">
        this and the anime has done a fantastic job with it. So just go and get it. <br />
<br />
<br />
The long review: Don&#039;t worry I&#039;ll not include any major plot spoilers and be as vague as possible if I ever get close to spoiling something.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
A gifted child who becomes a pasha at a very young age, despises war yet seems to have a talent to lead armies into battle. Now take this character and put him in a fantasy world where the continent/world is on the brink of war and things dont look very good for the protagonist&#039;s faction. <br />
<br />
I especially like how even if the factions seem black and white they have a surprising amount of depth and provide very valid reasoning of why they make the decisions that they do, for this reason alone the story is truly fantastic, the pacing in the beginning is fairly slow, be warned but it will pick up  eventually. The manner in which the politics side of the story was handled is simply marvellous. While the pacing may seem off, thats about the only negative thing about the story but imo, it starts off slow then picks up in the later episodes and I&#039;m okay with that. Your mileage may vary. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
This one is going to be relatively short. The art is bloody gorgeous, from the cities to the manner in which armies were showcased battling it out to the unique culture based on character clothing and the characters  themselves, the art is lovely, its vivid, colourful. The only negative thing I can think of here is making the battle scenes look more dark and gritty but chances are they didn&#039;t want to switch art styles and decided to stick to just one. So its not that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Okay, the music, hands down is absolutely lovely. I have no idea who produced the music but it gave me goosebumps the same way attack on titan did with its music. The voice actors were great and fit the characters really well. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
The only reason I rated it an 8? During the 12-24 episode mark, a lot of characters are introduced in each episode so if the pacing was slowed just a tad here the characters would have stood out a lot more, although they were just supporting characters and while they do have unique personalities and depth. The lack of screentime for them means you dont end up caring all that much about them. Apart from that, every single character, has valid reasoning on why they take the actions that they do, its not at all shallow and behave the way a person would if they were put in a situation like that. So hats off, characters are truly fantastic. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing more that can be said, I&#039;m extremely satisfied with this anime and I sincerely hope that they were successful enough to produce another season soon. This anime is a true hidden gem and I highly recommend it to anyone thats even remotely interested in strategies, politics and the epic fantasy genre.

    I was looking at recommendations and found this anime similar to code geass which I consider one of the best anime of all time so I started watching it and I got hooked from episode one!<br />
<br />
This is a great show about middle age warfare and battle tactics and follows a strong main character Tughril Mahmut Pasha. The Story is good and has some of the best plot twists I have seen in anime so far. Mahmut&#039;s desire for peace and willingness to go to war to establish peace attracts people who later become his companions. Even the side characters are charismatic and keep you engaged.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295439">
         <br />
<br />
One of the most underrated anime IMO. This deserves to be well over 8.

    (If you want the TL;DR epic memer gamer edition, skip to the bottom.)<br />
<br />
Listen Brody, this show is slept on. Simple. <br />
<br />
If you look this show up on YouTube or Google, you&#039;re not gonna find many clips and there is like no big YouTube channel that has covered this anime. Heck, I even had a hard time finding the OP and ED which goes to show it&#039;s really under the radar and that&#039;s a damn shame because this show is actually REALLY GOOD. If you enjoyed shows like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMA:B) or Vinland Saga, then keep reading. <br />
<br />
Like FMA:B, this show is a shounen. Unlike

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339590">
        many shounens howeer, this show subverts typical shounen tropes and does a pretty good job of exploring the themes of a shounen without relying on gimmicks like filler episodes and excessive fanservice. Throughout the story, the main character matures and grows from his mistakes and experiences, and ultimately becomes a Chad. Guess what teenagers go through? Character development (and puberty). Part of growing up is realizing that it&#039;s okay to make mistakes. This show subverts the trope of having an infallible hero who is perfect and incapable of failing during the most important set pieces, keeping the viewers invested during important climaxes in the story. This show doesn&#039;t boast any magical superhuman powers and instead prefers to keep itself grounded in realism. The only &quot;powers&quot; the MC has is his prestigious military background as a pasha (minister/high ranking officer), his enduring convictions, his ingenuity and wits, and his trusty companion eagle whom he uses as an offensive attack and as a messenger/scout. The grounded realism serves to make it much more entertaining to see how the protagonist overcomes his obstacle, and makes it also more relatable and believable. This leads to the next aspect of the show I really liked.<br />
<br />
This show is also really historical, and being a history buff myself, this tickles my pickle plenty!!! How many animes actually explore the Sultanate days or even involve Middle Eastern/Turkish culture and history? The show definitely reminded me of Vinland Saga, FMA: Brotherhood, and Log Horizon as I was watching the political mind games being held between our protagonist and antagonist. The show has a lot of behind the scenes planning, such as secret plots and assassinations, power struggles, political/economic implications and consequences resulting from the loss of territories/battles, etc.. The main character himself is politically and personally motivated by his own convictions, and undertakes actions befitting of one who is on a personal and political mission. In one episode he may be seen being gathering intel using spy networks and sneaking around enemy compound, while in the next episode he may be seen on the field leading troops.  To top it off, the conflicts that occur in each arc of the show are all part of a bigger political theater involving the entire region, pitting nations against each other.<br />
<br />
I like watching isekais partly because of the feeling of discovering something grandiose. When you get sent to another world different from yours, a whole new frontier opens up and you get loads of potential and opportunity to go on adventures and do grand things. So when I was watching the MC travel across Arabian deserts under the cover of night and sail across the seas on his adventures of self discovery and heroic ambitions, I was deeply immersed and invested with the story, characters, and the journeys they took to get to where they wanted to be. It felt as if I was adventuring alongside the cast as an outside observer. I can definitely say the show successfully manages to appeal my desires to explore and adventure. So if you&#039;re like me and you enjoy open world games for the exploration, adventuring/quests, and vast landscapes offered, then you&#039;ll probably like this show. <br />
<br />
So if you like adventure, exploration, cross-cultural exchanges, and political/military themes in anime, then this show is definitely up your alley. It&#039;s not perfect or a masterpiece like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but it&#039;s a damn good show for what it&#039;s worth and what it shoots for. Also the ending song for the first half of the show just slaps.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Watch this show if you want to feel like Assassin&#039;s Creed Ali-Baba Origins meets Aladdin meets Mount and Blade meets Arabian James Bond

    hi<br />
first time reviewer here<br />
I started this anime mostly because the art looked awesome and a lot of people were complaining about it ( i like being contrary)... and man am i glad that i did. I don&#039;t really get why people didn&#039;t like it. The story was really engaging and you really see mahmuts growth from a naive idealistic child to a seasoned warrior who has seen the worst but still hopes for the best and I really liked all the strategies and tactics employed by both armies ( as in it felt pretty realistic ... I definitely don&#039;t want to deal with that in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274448">
        my real life ). The only downside i felt was that the story was too fast. You have to pay close attention or you&#039;ll be left behind but that&#039;s not very difficult to do thanks to the amazing story line. My favourite character was definitely zaganos pasha though his part was short. He was ambitious and had plenty of foresight( stemming from an underlying obsession?) All in all I&#039;d definitely recommend this to all (any?) who reads this :D

    This anime has a different mood than the others. The characters are not ordinary. A lot of effort has been spent on each character. The rating is low because there is no fanservices. The first two parts were not very good, but each progressive part was a better anime. Both the story and the characters are much better towards the final part. I&#039;m so excited about the final part. <br />
The historical texts and fiction in the anime are very harmonious. Anime music is very successful and very compatible with historical atmospheres and events<br />
Although it usually has very nice drawings. Some parts were not of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264058">
        same quality, but these are not many. Much effort has been devoted to drawing clothes and historical sites. It might be better to keep these scenes longer because I can see these beautiful drawings more clearly.<br />
I love this anime :)

    This is a Turk&#039;s review (Sörry för bâd englişh).<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t seen any turkish review here so i decided to write someting here. This is a turkish inspired series after all. But this review is not every Turk&#039;s opinion, this is my personal opinion.<br />
<br />
First of all i thank you to mangaka. She did pretty well. I was so sick of seeing sterotypes of our history. In every movie, every anime, even every child cartoons. Like turks ride camels in eternal desert, every turkish woman are dancers (like şara character), turks look like arabians or indians (don&#039;t get me wrong, i like their cultures too but turks

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337750">
        are different) and of course turks cut your head for their home accesory, make slaves your family, make your dog döner kebab etc.<br />
Yeah about &quot;turks are barbarians&quot;... Turks are soldier people in history. Does this make them barbarians? It&#039;s up to your opinion. Like in this series. <br />
<br />
All of these may mean nothing to you. But belive me, i appreciated so much. Of course it&#039;s not 100% acurate about our culture and i shouldn&#039;t be. It is a fictional story. I can see a lot of  Turks agree with me here.<br />
<br />
Okay anyway,  let&#039;s make this a real review. There are many turkish words in series. Hearing turkish words in japanese accent was so interesting and so enjoying (Mahhmuto Paşha!). Of course i understood every turkish word and there were a lot of  little word tricks. Like &quot;Zehir Zağanos Paşa&quot;: Zehir means poison. And we call cunning people &quot;zehir&quot;. Or &quot;Tuğrul&quot; means wild bird. Such wisely chosen words. It&#039;s so sad you can&#039;t understand them. <br />
<br />
(Little spoilers here maybe&gt;) And story. I&#039;m not a good critic but it was good for me. Sometimes i found it just illogical. In that &quot;stealing the sheeps&quot; scene, yes it was so cool scene but i just laughed at there. There are a few scenes like that but not much in my opinion. <br />
There were almost nothing about religions and i think it&#039;s a good decision. So the story could focus on political and economic wars. <br />
Plus, there were some historical references like wars or people in turkish history. That&#039;s another special part.<br />
<br />
(Little spoilers here maybe&gt;) Characters... It&#039;s hard to explain it. Some characters are just like there. Like Cyrus. I didn&#039;t understand why he is there. Even Abiriga&#039;s role was barely important for the story. But villians did their job. Especially Balaban. And i have to write something about Tuğrul&#039;s transformation. I mean his ultimate girl form. Every time he says &quot;I need to hide my identity&quot;, he disguises as a girl. And somehow, when this happens, his whole face turns into girlish. It weirds me out every time. I know it&#039;s a typical anime stuff. Maybe i&#039;m too fogey for this. Sorry otaku friends, no offence.<br />
<br />
Music. My ears are just for listening not hearing but i couldn&#039;t notice real ottoman music instruments. But still, i liked musics.<br />
<br />
Art. Not a uniqe style but you can feel the historical texture in the background.<br />
<br />
My overall rating is like 7,5 but i give it an 8.<br />
<br />
This was my first review and probably the last one. Writing it in english was so hard for me. Thanks for reading this thing. Have a nice day.

    I&#039;ve been looking for anime with nice plot and characters, without harem, cheesy romance nor annoying characters who only know how to burden others. This anime is the answer to that. So glad I found it. For me, it&#039;s not boring at all. You can see the characters&#039; development as the time passes. This anime definitely is a must watch for this season. Don&#039;t be fooled by the rating. Many great animes have been neglected because of the low rating, so I suggest you guys watch it and judge for yourself. Believe in your instinct since everyone&#039;s tastes can never be the same. I just

    Skimming through a series of first episodes, I had no expectations for this show going in, or any idea what it would be about, but this show was truly a hidden gem. Every part of it is rich with depth and detail, from the art to the tactics that drive the plot.<br />
<br />
The crux of the story is simple: A young boy loses his home to war, and devotes his life to becoming a politician who can prevent it. How he goes about doing that however, is entirely outstanding and unpredictable, and while the maps are hard to follow, the logic of his actions are always

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285982">
        made clear, enlightening the viewer. With the exception of the extent of his ability to handle his golden eagle, every conflict, either political or physical is resolved in an ingenious manner. It may not be too flashy, and he isn&#039;t always able to achieve his goals, but this is a great view of a pacifist yet brilliant and intellectual war tactician.<br />
<br />
I loved the sheer quality and number of cultural designs that went into this anime - and when you consider the level of detail in heavily animated features like clothing and ornamental accessories, this anime becomes an outstanding feat based on the effort and outcome of the visuals alone.<br />
<br />
The cast is admittedly very large, even for 24 episodes, but every character is distinct, well designed, and none of them are cliche, or there to provide comic relief. While most of  the cast&#039;s present and past hardships are made clear through the story, we aren&#039;t presented with any sob stories, or pity parties at any point in the series. Rather than dwelling in their sorrow, most of these characters are great examples of strength and fortitude that think only of the future and the consequences of their actions, which by itself makes this anime enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
The titles, like Pasha, and Bey, can be a bit hard to follow, but prepare to be fully immersed in a remade world, filled with diverse cultures, whose civilisation is on the brink of discovering gun warfare. When is the next season coming out?!

    Like most of the reviews I have seen for this show, I was utterly shocked to see the overall rating for it: a six. <br />
<br />
To me, that is too low for a series as great as this. I am someone who is not usually into history, but I enjoy this show. The story is so intriguing that I believe anyone can find enjoyment as well if you stick with is. Do not stop at the first couple of episodes. Keep watching and you won&#039;t regret it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I feel as though the animation really lacks. The art itself is great, as far as style and design.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265236">
        As someone who is in love with character designs in general, seeing previews of this anime was enough for me to check it out. So much detail went into the characters clothes and the architecture and scenery. It seems as though the animation suffered a bit due to that, sometimes looking a little cheap. Luckily, it is something I can overlook because the designs are so brilliant, as with the rest of the anime.<br />
<br />
Again, I knew not a single thing about the historical setting this story is placed in. Usually, I would be bored by this type of historical setting. While it can feel like a lot of information for me personally, I still manage to keep up and understand what is going on.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t overlook this great anime.

    I can only try to imagine why the rating is so low for such a beautifully contructed anime. It is true that this show deals with political and military concepts that would interest few and fly over the heads of most -- but for those who would be even slightly interested in such themes, this anime will prove to be pure gold.<br />
<br />
From the truly ingenious trategic plots and elaborate geopolitical affairs presented, to the marvelous character development and story progression, this anime truly manages to stand out in all fields. The way it manages plot twists, cliffhangers and other storytelling devices without seeming repetitive or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264235">
        predictable even for a second is truly commendable. The character designs are charming and original and the color palette is very befitting. In addition, the portrayal of and allusions to previously existing nations and empires is astoundingly accurate and fascinating.<br />
<br />
I admit it is very different from any anime I&#039;ve seen before. Many people compare it to Arslan Senki, since it deals with a similar subject matter. I agree that on that front - military operations, battles and sieges of countries of ultimate supremacy, Shoukoku no Altair is quite similar to Arsland Senki and I daresay it just as good. It differs mainly, in my opinion, in that it doesn&#039;t mainly focus on action and adventure, but actually in the events that would take place in conference rooms between military and country leaders. It is more about the strategy and the conspiracy, rather than the execution of the plan. What is more, in my opinion, Mahmut is a much cleverer and more pragmatic leader than Arslan; being an astounding orator and diplomat, despite his young age, he is able to conceive and orchestrate elaborate schemes by himself, rather than just being a charismatic leader who relies on his allies for the behind-the-scenes work.<br />
<br />
Despite all this, Shoukoku no Altair is easy to follow, process and digest. No excess attention or thinking is required to keep up with the events, and the characters are easy to remember and recognize. And while I focused a lot on the intellectual wars this anime presents, it actually does also focus on battles, adventures and the like. Trust me, it&#039;s a lot more interesting than I make it sound.<br />
<br />
All in all this is a beautiful anime worthy of much more recognition than it has gotten thus far. It seems most people would be immeditely drawn aback when confronted with a historical military drama; however, at the end of the day, this is a shounen. I am certain that if given a chance it will manage to intrigue one more than originally expected.

    I have completed 16 episodes of this running season. So far it is one of the best tactics and strategy based anime I have come across. Its fun, engaging, fast paced and a great fodder for the mind without being overly complex. <br />
I was surprised to see such a low score on MAL which was not fair. This one should easily be rated close to 8.5. So I decided to create an account and do my bit. Good creators must be appreciated, so that good content keeps on coming.  <br />
You will surely enjoy the journey. Although it is still Season 1, I hope the

    This absolutely butchers the manga. So many scenes were cut out and shortened down to almost nothing, and plenty of scenes were changed for the worse. Even some characters are cut from the show. I don&#039;t know why they even bothered with animating this series if they&#039;re gonna cut out so much from it. The opening songs are nice and so is the animation, as is the soundtrack and voice acting, but this anime bares little resemblance to the manga it&#039;s adapted from. <br />
<br />
At the start it wasn&#039;t so bad, it had the characters and the scenes, there were some deviations but nothing that was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265278">
        bad. Around episode 15 and up, it&#039;s nothing but shortened scenes and many strange changes, plus the pacing feels strange because of the cut plot. Don&#039;t waste your time with this anime, read the manga instead and you&#039;ll have a much more enjoyable and less confusing time
