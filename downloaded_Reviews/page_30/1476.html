    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Friendzone: The Anime<br />
<br />
The plot of Isshuukan Friends consists of a young boy (Hase) who is in love with a beautiful yet estranged girl (Fujimiya). The girl suffers from a condition in which parts of her memories are erased on a weekly basis, on each Monday. This makes it so that Hase, in order to befriend her, is required to introduce himself to her constantly just to keep up their friendship. It also makes for one of the most frustrating anime to watch; it contains one of the biggest &quot;love that never was&quot;.<br />
<br />
Isshuukan Friends is structured in a way that every single episode,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149239">
        more or less, plays out like each other. It is the same uniqueness that makes it stand out that also hurts it. For Hase and Fujimiya, developing a friendship is already difficult enough, let alone a love-relationship. If you are looking for some sort of intimacy between the two main characters, you won&#039;t find it here. Of course, Hase and Fujimiiya&#039;s relationship isn&#039;t the only thing that is worth noting of Isshuukan Friends. The core side characters, Kiryuu and Yamagishi, are absolutely hilarious. They honestly make up for half of the show&#039;s enjoyment; one is stoic and carefree (Kiryuu), the other is clumsy and careless (Yamagishi). Together, they make the various slice-of-life moments in Isshuukan Friends a little more crazy, and all the more enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
The &quot;turning point&quot; in Isshuukan Friends (if you can even call it that) occurs around episode 7-8, in which a new character, Kujou Hajime, is introduced. Since &quot;Hajime&quot; is a perfect pun of a name, we can assume that his introduction will lead to the climax of the story. And for a while, it does indeed seem like that. However, just as quickly as Kujou was introduced does Isshuukan Friends revert to its original plot. What could have been a suspenseful, possibly drama-filled ending ended up falling flat on its face. It&#039;s such a shame to see something that great go to waste.<br />
<br />
Now, one of the things that Ishuukan Friends was able to capitalize on was its art. Fitting nicely into its Spring debut time, Isshuukan Friends used quite palatable colors, mainly light ones. Its color scheme is definitely something that is not commonplace in most anime, and that uniqueness in itself makes it a refreshing change of pace. With heavy focus on yellow, orange, and white, this is an anime that simply radiates &quot;springness&quot;. If springtime flowers come off as beautiful to you, Isshuukan Friends&#039;s art should do the same.<br />
<br />
Originally a promising prospect, Isshuukan Friends took an unfortunate nosedive toward a circular plot, one in which the beginning resembles the end. In a romance anime where the main characters do not develop a love relationship, the main draws would then be its art and side characters; and it&#039;s true, those two aspects really do serve to hold this anime together. For what it&#039;s worth, Isshuukan Friends is an enjoyable watch. However, don&#039;t expect to get anywhere by the end; this is an anime in which you really should focus on the ride, and not the destination. However, is this a ride strong enough to overcome the lack of a destination? To that, I would have to say no.<br />

    While there are some people who prefer solitude and independence, most people are social by nature, and they desire friends to laugh and struggle with in both the good times and the bad. Good company is invaluable, and thus it is important to distinguish who your true friends are. Genuine friendship should not rely on a relationship that is give and take, but rather a relationship based on mutual respect, trust in one another, and unconditional support. A good friendship takes time to mature and develop into an unbreakable bond, and oftentimes requires that friendship to undergo trials and tribulations. One Week Friends explores this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148045">
        concept and follows the growing relationship between Hase Yuuki and Fujimiya Kaori and the struggles they encounter as they begin to understand the meaning of true friendship.<br />
<br />
Set in an ordinary high school, One Week Friends tells the story of Fujimiya Kaori, a girl who mysteriously loses her memories at the end of every week. What makes this situation even more complex is the fact that she only loses those memories that involve people she befriends. For this reason, she distances herself from everyone else and appears to have a cold demeanor. Hase Yuuki, a boy in her class, notices that she is always alone and resolves to become friends with her and summons the courage to talk to her. <br />
<br />
For a typical high school boy meets girl slice of life show, the story is nothing special; in fact, the whole memory loss of only friends concept is quite farfetched and unrealistic, even for an anime show. However, looking past that fact, the show is quite adorable and heartwarming. From watching Hase slowly help Fujimiya overcome her condition to laughing as Shougo scolds a hopeless Hase, One Week Friends does a good job of making you smile and induces a rather wide range of emotions. It is slow paced and mellow, but that adds to its charm and the relaxed environment of the show. The small amounts of drama are handled well without getting out of hand or being needless. Disregarding the unrealistic aspect of the show, the characters themselves are quite realistic and are characters that are relatable and likable.<br />
<br />
Hase represents our typical awkward high school boy. While slightly airheaded and bad at studying, he does have a kind heart and has the patience and persistance needed to befriend someone like Fujimiya. However, he is human, and this is made apparent when he struggles with the problems that arise due to the complexity of Fujimiya&#039;s situation. He is quite selfish, becomes easily jealous, and can be immature at times, yet gives it his all and has a genuine desire to befriend Fujimiya and wishes for her happiness. Hase is appealing as a male MC for this reason; his personality is realistic and basic.<br />
<br />
Fujimiya is our innocent and earnest girl whose biggest dreams include doing fun things with her friends. It is hard to imagine how incredibly lonely and depressed it would be having to purposefully ignore everyone while in reality you want nothing more to befriend them. She decides to shoulder her problem by herself, and doesn&#039;t want anyone else to get hurt because of her illness. While she appears mean and unfriendly, she&#039;s actually a cheery girl who has an affinity for math and cooking. Hase helps her slowly open up and become more confident in herself, and to not be afraid to make more friends.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the supporting characters are fairly well developed and come into their own as the show progresses. Shougo is Hase&#039;s voice of reason and a guy who never seems to care much for anything. Extremely blunt and logical, he isn&#039;t afraid to speak his mind. He&#039;s constantly helping and advising Hase, and while he treats it as a bothersome task, he always seems to come through with solid counsel. For someone that seems unmovable and aloof, he is unusually helpful as he also helps Yamagishi Saki, an old elementary school classmate of his. A forgetful girl who is clumsy and often teased because of it, she sees Shougo as a reliable person who could take care of her, and her relationship with Shougo is unconventional but interesting and adorable to watch as they deal with their feelings for one another.<br />
<br />
While there are hints of it, romance is not the central theme of the show. It can be easily seen that Hase doesn&#039;t consider Fujimiya as a simple friend, but the show doesn&#039;t emphasize it. Shougo and Saki&#039;s relationship is also clearly not just being casual friends, and while you get the feeling that there is something more between the two, the show is quite subtle and indirect about it. I&#039;m sure that many people want to see Hase and Fujimiya together, or Shougo and Saki together, but dating and romantical relationships is a much more minor aspect of the show. Whether you don&#039;t mind or consider it frustrating, there are still many more enjoyable aspects of the show. <br />
<br />
The show, being an adaptation of a 4-panel manga, has a quaint and delicate art style. Everything seems relaxed and the art reflects that feeling. The character designs are simple and fit their personalities quite well. The opening and ending theme songs are vibrant and mellow, and are nice to listen to. Being a typical slice of life set at a high school, the music and art both follow the standard conventions of the genre. No complaints about either art or sound, but nothing that deserves a commendation.<br />
<br />
One Week Friends takes a delicate subject and an unusual setting and turns it into a nice slice of life high school story that may just make you laugh and smile. While the premise of the show is a bit too convenient and unrealistic, the charm of the show lies in its character development and tender moments. The show addresses a basic yet essential aspect of life that is present in most of us and presents it in a nice and heartwarming way. <br />

    “Please be friends with me” – Hase. (every single week)<br />
<br />
A show about making friends that can be said in 5 simple words. You might think that could turn into a century old trope but Isshuukan Friends (One Week Friends) does something different. It revolutionizes that very simple idea of making friends to bring about a show that is so much more. Based off the manga of the same name written by Matcha Hazuki, making friends is more than just reaching out and extending your hand. <br />
<br />
Taken for granted, Isshuukan Friends has a very simple premise. It’s about making friends. The title itself is also easy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148033">
        to take notice as translated to “One Week Friends” because main characters Yuuki Hase and Kaori Fujimiya become friends for one week before she loses her memories in the case of amnesia. The show is honest and to the point but at the same time thought provoking. After all, making friends can be simple for some people yet could also be the most challenging task in the world for others. Step in the shoes of Kaori Fujimiya, she could be easily be depicted as the one meeting facing such a challenge.<br />
<br />
At first glance, there’s a lot of contrasting traits between Hase and Kaori. Hase is cheerful, outgoing, and is easily able to make friends. His strength lies in his ability to make other Hase feels good about what’s around them with his personality. On the other hand, Kaori is shy, repressed, and in general a solitary girl with little friends. Her strength is mathematics in class which is awful at. Taken for granted, the two doesn’t exactly match together as cookie and dough. Yet, there’s a unique connection between them. From minute one they meet, there’s a friendly atmosphere that Yuki brings towards her. His honesty and sincerity is worthy enough to allow Kaori to be open towards him and even others. The catch is the amnesia because she forgets every moment they’ve spent together for that week. It’s a heartwarming story yet with a slight taste of tragedy because of Kaori’s circumstances. As evidenced from flashbacks, Kaori was put into a situation that made her the way she is today. Not exactly the fun way to grow up I’d say.<br />
 <br />
Friendship is a key theme in the show. Almost everything builds off from the friendship that Kaori and Yuki share each episode. They learn more about each other and do simple yet meaningful activities together whether it’s studying, eating bentos, or karaoke. In essence, they craft memories but only Yuki is able to remember them. However, it’s also noticeable that Hase’s effort is not entirely fruitless. Throughout the series, Kaori is able to retain some of those precious memories. Take it as a treasure but every day, every hour, every minute, every second that the duo share is build off of friendship.<br />
<br />
Despite being the main characters, others does get involved in the story as well such as Hase’s best friend Shogo and his classmate Saki. Both of them have contrasting personalities but plays an engaging role in the story overall with their persona. To further cement their roles, we see how they are able to bring together Hase and Kaori together in the form of an inner circle. But for what’s worth, it also ties back together the main concept of friendship. We get it as a simple idea but there’s a complexity behind it as well. Remember, Kaori forgets her memories every week with the friends she makes. Those precious memories might have once existed in reality but remains a fantasy for her. We see a glimpse of Kaori’s sadness behind her façade as she truly wants the friends she made be close to her. At the same time though, there’s also a charming presence we get from the way she reacts towards sincere moments. She takes friendly gestures, especially from Yuki, for what’s worth. In fact, Kaori even returns Hase’s friendship with her own actions and the two become like peas in a pod.<br />
<br />
There are also other feelings this show can bring out quite well. For one, there’s honesty coming from Shougo and his words. He never hides anything from his friends and can be described as a sarcastic guy but with a warm heart. One other obvious feeling is the thought of romance involving Yuki. There are big hints but Kaori remains rather oblivious. But unlike usual cliché, there’s no misunderstandings, cheesy, or tsundere responses. Instead, we get innocence and even realistic feeling of relationships connected by friendship. It builds off seamlessly integrated scenarios related to the events of their time together. And regardless of amnesia or not, the time they spent together is real. There’s no taking back that, not now or ever. <br />
<br />
As innocent and heartwarming the show is, Isshuukan Friends isn’t shy to demonstrate maturity. Characters grow and become like part of a stage play where they each possesses their own unique characteristics. But the biggest skill of the show is to tell a story. It doesn’t need to be linear or arc format to transit thought. Rather, Isshuukan Friends demonstrates slice of life by telling and showing the story of how these characters share friendship. It might sound a bit dry and cheesy. However, the way this show does it is delightful. The comedy doesn’t get in the way and neither is it forced. There’s no asinine sarcasm exploding like or love polygons with people getting hurt over trivial love. The drama only touches the surface of how friends come together and can be relatable. Remember the first time you made friends with someone? There’s that special feeling and this show brings explicitly out that idea to its very best, formulated with its unique gimmicks.<br />
<br />
The artwork has a charming and colorful background to illustrate its innocence. It’s delicate with bittersweet moments decorated by the natural style of its backgrounds with some resemblance to Usagi Drop. Characters are designed to demonstrate their innocence such as Kaori’s frail stature. Camera angles are focused and sometimes lengthened during more memorable moments to accurately show how much they are worth. It’s more than just the classic ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’. Instead, it creates feeling of emotions. The carefully concentrated focus on the eyes shows feelings from the characters and their personalities. It’s how the show lets the viewers know its feelings by showing rather than telling. No fan service or absurd misunderstandings. What we get feels real and is real.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is pleasant and lighthearted. That should be the given with everything already shown throughout each episode. The OST has a beautiful rhythm and is gentle that stays in unity with the atmosphere of the show. Character voices too are soft-spoken with characters such as Kaori and Saki. And while the guys’ voices sometimes can feel monotonous, they command honesty and sincerity. The OP &amp; ED songs has a similar way of showing its style to match the overall premise, one that is endearing.<br />
<br />
Isshuuken Friends is anime that anyone can watch firsthand. It’s charming, innocent, relatable, and beautiful with its aspects. Its drama isn’t forceful and neither does the story go off track with any trite of clichés. Although the story may feel slow at times with its pacing, the reward and patience is worth it. Take it as a gift, similar to how you feel like when you made your first friend. That’s how the show will feel like, one which is rewarding. Because friends are like treasures, this show is one that I definitely cherish. <br />

    A heart-warming and satisfying story centering around true friendship and the subjectivity of memories and all the meanwhile it doesn&#039;t get too stifling in the process of the story: Isshuukan Friends. Such a marvelous story that people should give a watch.<br />
<br />
Story: Isshuukan Friends is about a girl named Fuijimiya Kaori who has post traumatic stress disorder, and her memories reset every Monday. One day, she meets a boy named Hase Yuuki who wants to be her friend, and the story starts from there. As Fuijmiya continuously forgets who Hase is, Hase tries to keep their friendship alive, or start their friendship anew, again and again

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164379">
        by asking Fuijimiya to be his friend. In this friendship/romance anime, there&#039;s no love triangle, violence, or anything crazy like that. It’s about making friends, maintaining friends, and going through problems with friends until the end. Very touching and well-written plot, I thought. A very innocent and pure story.<br />
<br />
Art: I don&#039;t know exactly how to rate art in an anime because I never really dislike art. The art in Isshuukan Friends was really colorful, and to me, it seemed like the character’s artwork reflected the character’s personality.<br />
<br />
Sound: No special music that really caught my attention, but the opening and ending songs were lovely. <br />
<br />
Characters: The characters themselves are interesting and really likeable. Fujimiya is a girl who puts up a nonchalent and somewhat cold personality act, even though inside she&#039;s innocent, and kind. Hase-kun is a boy who is naive, innocent and persistent. Alongside the main cast, are the side characters that bring realism of friendship into the anime. Kiryuu is Hase-kun’s best friend, who serves as a quiet, bored and wise wing-man friend. I really liked him! Throughout the anime, characters grow. Their relationships bud, with Fujimiya remembering trivial details about friends, Kiyruu showing more of his dear side, and Hase’s determination to repetitively be friends from scratch again with Fujimiya taking ups and downs. We are also introduced to the bad guy later in the anime, although he&#039;s not really a character the audience hates, but rather can relate to. I loved all the characters really, their liveliness added to the plot.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed watching Isshuukan friends, despite it not having any really memorable moments, the entire story was just relaxing, touching, and feel-good to watch. Isshuukan Friends is a good anime to watch when you&#039;re feeling bored, sad, and tired. It should make you feel better, I think!

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**<br />
<br />
Friendship: it’s a concept that has been done to DEATH not only by anime, but also by virtually every other form of entertainment known to man. When you think of cliché themes that TV shows and movies have senselessly bashed into our skulls repeatedly to the point that it becomes sickening, it doesn’t take long to think of “friendship”. However, One Week Friends (“Isshuukan Friends”) is proof that an over-done concept can still be very enjoyable and extremely effective when presented in a fresh and outside-the-box manner.  At the risk of sounding much more like a girl than a guy, this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148423">
        can really be summed up in one word: cute. Not in the disgustingly moe, in-your-face kind of cute, but in a very pure and genuine kind of cute that lulls you into a state of tranquility. While I am normally someone who doesn’t enjoy slice-of life shows, I don’t need to be in order appreciate the good writing and well-constructed characterization of what is definitely the best anime I watched during the Spring 2014 season (granted I only watched 6, so take that for what it&#039;s worth…).<br />
 <br />
Synopsis: A girl named Kaori Fujimiya has a psychosomatic condition that causes her to forget every positive memory she makes with other people outside of her family every week, rendering her unable to make friends. This causes her to become cold and detached from all things social. Hase Yuki, a boy in her class, decides that he will break through her cold exterior and become her friend. Even after he learns the truth, he is still determined to be friends with Fujimiya.<br />
 <br />
The storyline of OWF is amazing to me because it avoids the two things I hate most about slice-of-life anime: shows with no plot what so ever (some people are into that, but not me) and shows that have a plot, but are ridiculously melodramatic. This anime is special because it finds what I consider to be the perfect balance; it has an engaging plot, but very little over-exaggeration. The show has a charming enough tone and good enough characters that it doesn’t need to show people breaking down in tears for some petty reason every episode in order to maintain the interest of the viewer.  Not an episode went by in which I wasn’t charmed by the well-written characters and their adorable dialogues. However, like any slice of life, OWF is NOT a plot-driven show and I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that it starts to drag out a bit towards the end (starting around episode 8 or 9, I believe) and the pacing during the 2nd half could have definitely been better. Overall though, I was very impressed with the plot. The ending especially did a fantastic job of bringing the show’s message full circle in a natural way that never felt contrived.<br />
<br />
The quality of the storyline may exceed the average slice of life show, but what about the characters? As we all know, if the characters in this sort of show are bad, the show itself is bad. Luckily, OWF delivers with its characters as well, providing strong lead characters in addition to well-written side characters. Fujimiya and Hase, the two protagonists, are surprisingly complex for this kind of anime. Hase can admittedly be annoying and cowardly at times, but his internal struggle of wanting to help Fujimiya yet not knowing quite how to do it was the driving force of the show. He has legitimate and believable emotions that really allow the viewers to get behind him and feel exactly what he is feeling. Also, it’s rare that I come across a male anime character that I would describe as “cute”, but Hase is one of them (then again, basically every character in this show is cute. Like I said, this entire show is just absolutely adorable).  Fujimiya is also a well-written character. She doesn’t have as much of a personality as Hase, unfortunately, but her innocence and kind-hearted nature are part of what makes the show work so well. When Fujimiya is hurting, so are the viewers, and that proves how effective her characterization was. I also feel the need to mention the spectacular side characters, including the most adorable anime character I’ve ever seen: Saki Yamagishi. This girl is just INHUMANLY lovable. Every fiber of my being tells me that they laid the “cute” on too thick with her and were simply trying too hard to make her likeable, but those negative thoughts evaporate the second that Saki pops up on screen. And I don’t mean that only her appearance is cute, her personality is the thing that sells it. Coming from someone who is usually immune to “cute”, the writers of this show definitely knew what they were doing. Shogo Kiryu also stands out as a relatively complex and well-written character. Even Fujimiya’s mom makes a good impression in a very small and limited role! So in short, this is a very strong cast of characters and they truly make the experience of watching this anime worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Something that is also worth mentioning is how instrumental the animation is in creating the amazingly pure and relaxing tone of OWF. The art style often gets compared to watercolors; everything is very soft, but vibrant at the same time. I can’t imagine a more fitting animation style for this show. The OP is also very fitting for the show as is the ED; I got goosebumps several times when that piano from the beginning of the ED came in during the backround of a somewhat dramatic scene. The only thing in terms of aesthetics that fails to stand out is the OST, which isn’t that memorable. The above average voice acting makes up for that slight disappointment though.<br />
<br />
Overall, One Week Friends is a touching, relaxing and effective entry into the slice of life genre to the extent of which that people who aren’t fans of this type of anime can still enjoy it to the fullest (i.e. me). This show is a master of a writing technique that I consider to be very underrated; tone. OWF’s irrefutable feeling of tranquility and innocence was masterfully achieved through strong characters and a plot that knew exactly what it wanted to be. What else can I say? OWF is just delightful in every way despite its minor flaws. I would recommend this show to all people of all ages; it really is a worthwhile experience. Now excuse me while I go rewatch Black Lagoon and bathe in my own testosterone so I can feel like a man again.

    I am unwilling to repeat what others have already said so read if you want a different opinion on this anime. <br />
&quot;Everyone hates a Monday, right, it marks the first day of a long week ahead but what&#039;d happen if you feel like you have to start all over every Monday?&quot; A special feature to slice of life is that while some ignore the genre, a certain section enjoys it whole heartedly, the only strong points of slice of life anime are the characters from it, each one with a different personality coming from different backgrounds, It&#039;s like getting to meet and discover new people.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148483">
        nothing more to the plot of Isshuukan Friends than what could be read in the synopsis on MAL and it actually sounds like one that could be very fitting to an anime centered around fanservice, where the makers could supply the fans with unrestricted fanservice without worrying about any kind of development in the plot, it&#039;s characters and their relationships. If you&#039;re one of those people who carry a concept with you wherever you go, that anime can not be made without fanservice then turn around walk away and never look back. <br />
Isshuukan friends is an anime adaption of a manga originally published as a oneshot comic of the same name by Matcha Hazuki. Isshuukan Friends is Hazuki&#039;s debut work. The anime adaptation was done by the infamous Brain&#039;s base (though they have done some popular if not great work over the past few years and is working on two of the anime projects of this season,recent noteworthy works are Brother&#039;s conflict, Amnesia &amp; Tonari no Kaibutsu~Kun) and has been licensed by the equally famous Sentai Filmworks. It&#039;s an ordinary anime, with an ordinary genre of slice of life, and it revolves around ordinary children going to school,with main character&#039;s having Seiyuu&#039;s we don&#039;t even recognize. This anime doesn&#039;t wear a facade of grandeur so why the high rating you ask? What is really extraordinary about this anime is that it&#039;s ordinary and so simply beautiful, It&#039;s different as it&#039;s not trying to be anything. <br />
The characters are not cliched and actually sound (kudos to the voice acting) talk, look &amp; act their age. Even the deuteragonists have depth, that was just enough and just right to flesh a character out but also gives them nothing more than supporting roles to play (again a good thing)I like the nude palette of colours that is used for the animation. <br />
All the songs in the anime have great music, There is a full version to Hase Yuuki&#039;s Kanade (the song he sang at the Karaoke) There definitely was background music but I just did not catch it, my bad I don&#039;t collect BGMs unless they sound like Beethoven,Bach or Mozart did, but combined with scenes it could create the right atmosphere at the right moments, the timings were perfect so the OST is a HIT. <br />
<br />
I had some preconceived notions about this show, we all have, we&#039;re always pre-pared and ready to give out verdicts and I&#039;m only human so I can never not have a preview of what I might feel and something about this show that worried me the most was it&#039;s pacing, each episode seems to cover a week and I thought it would slowly become monotonous but it all rested well in the end. <br />
There are slight faults in the storyline that have made me question a few things but the show exhibits the complexity of the human brain with maturity, displaying what a new developing friendship has to go through to grow and bloom, it conveys all those feelings of shyness,love,anger,jealousy,forgetfulness,frustration,felicity, restlessness etc, how every Monday the girls memories got reset it sends the guy a few step backwards too. This anime doesn&#039;t provide you with extreme laughter or give you enough tears but it&#039;ll make you smile, from ear to ear :)<br />
While for several of the anime fans it might have gone unnoticed on the Anichart it has made my list of season favorites very gracefully, even though i&#039;ve been very lazy at watching anime this season and haven&#039;t watched much. Usually, by the time a show hits its end, my prepared perceptions of it are gone and my rating for it is lowered but my enjoyment in watching this show has been consistent, it hasn&#039;t gradually grown (it&#039;s not a bad thing for me) <br />
It&#039;s only when I am writing a review is when I fully understand how much I have liked an anime, how much I recall from it conventionally determines it and if it will stay with me I&#039;m not sure if they have tried to but this anime has felt very symbolic, maybe it&#039;s not trying to send any message at all but this is how I&#039;ve regarded it-<br />
If you want to live happily everyday, for the rest of your life you must seek joy in the little things in life. Memories are amazing but you can&#039;t touch them so what&#039;s more important than remembering memories is to keep at making them, keep making new memories.

    &quot;One Week Friends&quot; is one of those rare animes that you don&#039;t enjoy because of the overly-dramatic moments or complex plot; it&#039;s an anime you thoroughly enjoy through it&#039;s simple story and loveable characters. It&#039;s a work of art that deserves more praise than it&#039;s getting right now. Let me tell you why.<br />
<br />
The anime evolves around two friends; Hase-kun, a shy teenage boy with very few friends, and Fujimiya-san, a lonely girl who used to have many friends. When Hase-kun one day dares himself to talk to Fujimiya-san, she completely tries to push him away. It isn&#039;t until numerous attempts when Hase-kun gets closer to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151055">
        Fujimiya-san and learns her dark secret; she forgets everything about her friends once the week is over. It&#039;s up to Hase-kun to find out why and to help keep their friendship intact.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the animation is extremely well done. Even though it&#039;s just a cartoon, the shading, lens flare and tiny details from the uniforms and backpacks to the background bring the anime to life. It overall makes the anime even more enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
What I really enjoyed about this anime was how well they portray the characters and their feelings. Even though this show is only twelve episodes long, you get to know them so well that you feel like you&#039;ve known them for a longer time than that. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s because the character development isn&#039;t solely through dialogue, but a lot of body language as well. The animators did an excellent job with body language and making sure the viewer always gets a feel of what&#039;s going on, even though things are fairly silent. <br />
<br />
Another thing I enjoyed about this anime was the subtle humor. Even though this anime does have it&#039;s dark moments, it can give you a good laugh through second-hand embarrassment and &quot;wrong-place-wrong-time&quot; moments. Nothing raunchy here!<br />
<br />
But I think the most important thing to note about this anime is that it&#039;s written so that it can still be called a great anime whether it has a second season or not. Sure, there are still some questions left unanswered, and fans will be dying to know what happens next once the anime is over.<br />
<br />
 But even if this series never continues you can still assure yourself that things will end happily ever after for everyone. Unlike other anime that never continued and forced you to read the manga to find out what happens next. <br />
<br />
Yes, I would love it if the series did continue and we see how things turn out, yet there&#039;s a feeling that I know what will happen next at the same time.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, &quot;One Week Friends&quot; is a satisfying anime that will make you laugh, cry and leave you with wanting more. This anime is proof that the best anime&#039;s out there don&#039;t need to have complex plots to be remembered forever, just excellent characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone; whether you&#039;ve never watched anime before or you&#039;ve watched enough to catch every anime reference made in a show.<br />
<br />
THE VERDICT:<br />
+ Perfect Animation<br />
+ Excellent Story<br />
+ Great Characters<br />
+ Wide Audience Appeal<br />
<br />
SCORE: 9/10<br />
<br />
EXCELLENT!

    Story:<br />
  The show is perceived as a innocent slice of life anime. It serves it&#039;s purpose with that. The show was told in a nice fashion. It achieves a good momentum in which the story is told. The story was simple to understand for the most part and there wasn&#039;t really much complexity. There was never really a dull moment in the show where I got bored of watching it. As soon as a problem ended there was always something new in the way. For a &quot;slice of life&quot; anime, it really kept me wanting more. The plot of the show was unique itself,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148331">
        since I haven&#039;t heard about another anime that has to do with a character losing her memories of her friends every week. The ending was very heartwarming. After the series ended it had me wanted more of the two characters to see where their lives lead them.<br />
Art:<br />
  The art in the show was probably one of it best aspects. The animation uses light coloring which makes it easy to watch. The detail in every little thing in the background made it even more better. The art style reminds me of the show Oreshura which I enjoyed also. The character art was spectacular. The light coloring of the characters really made it more of the innocent aspect in which I said. The art sets the mood the how the show is perceived. It shows it as a show about friendship and high school life. Nothing more, nothing less.<br />
Sound:<br />
  The downfall of the show for me would have to be the sound. I never really found any of the BGM to be memorable. Of course that&#039;s not to say I didn&#039;t like the opening and ending. The ending was one of the best songs I&#039;ve ever heard which was sung by the voice of Kaori. The VA for the characters fit in very well. No voice in the anime ever felt like it was out of place. Each VA in the show did a fantastic job to voice each character.<br />
Characters:<br />
  This is where the show shines. You have Hase Yuuki. He&#039;s a nice guy that cares about others more than he cares himself. Through out the entire anime, everything that he does is for the sake of Fujimiya.  Then you have Fujimiya Kaori. Probably one of the sweetest female characters in anime history. I mean come on! This girl is just so kind and she&#039;s so much of a sweetheart. She puts others in front of herself just like Hase. Main characters aside you also have a good cast of side characters. One of my favorite being Kiryu Shogo. He&#039;s Hase&#039;s bestfriend and does well in all of his classes. He appears to be a cold-hearted character but over time it is shown that he cares about his friends and just doesn&#039;t express it well. You then have the adorable Yamagishi Saki which in my opinion was the cutest character. She was always funny to watch. Even when they would study she would procrastinate which were funny to see her just goof around. Other side characters are shown but they don&#039;t really interact with the story as much. Overall I loved each and every character in the show and there wasn&#039;t really any character in which I disliked.<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
  As a person that watches anime on a daily basis. I really came to enjoy this anime compared to other &quot;slice of life&quot; animes. I would highly recommend this anime to people that enjoy the &quot;slice of life&quot; genre. The anime is currently ongoing as a fan from the manga I would have to say I&#039;ve enjoyed watching this series as much as I&#039;ve read the series. I would probably watch this anime again just so I can see each individual character grow as the show progresses. If the show would be licensed I would probably get it just because I would love to be able to lend this anime to anyone who&#039;s interested. I would probably remember this anime through out my life because this was one of the best &quot;slice of life&quot; animes I&#039;ve watched, another good example being &quot;Kokoro Connect&quot;.

    This is not a romantic comedy or a romance. Instead, you get a groundhog day adaption on young relationships in high school with a small amount of generic slice of life. We can sum up this anime as heartwarming but uneventful. This anime is adapted from a manga (partial 4 koma) by the same name and covers 4 of 6 volumes. Also, the manga is better than the adaption as much of the interesting dialogue that gives characters personality is absent in the anime.<br />
<br />
Watch this if you like sickeningly yet bland sweet slice of life that moves at a snail&#039;s pace and enjoy fictional relationships.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156631">
        Do not watch this if you enjoy dramas, are looking for romance in your anime, or want to punch weak characters in the face.<br />
<br />
Story/Plot/Summary<br />
<br />
The anime  about a young boy (Yuuki Hase) who tries to befriend (and romance) a young girl (Kaori Fujimiya). The twist here is that Kaori&#039;s memory of anyone she&#039;s friends with disappears at the start of every Monday. The twist makes for a interesting anime but the plot, dialogue, and writing fails realize the full potential of the twist. Any semblance of friendship or romance is weak, and the interaction between characters is simplistic, fragile, and boring. <br />
<br />
The plot twist should have provided many unique events that could lead to interesting developments but it fails to do so. Instead, the author decided to insert random events (deus ex machina) and provide forgettable drama between Hase and Kaori. Also, you get immersion breaking actions either when characters break character or the author uses deus ex machina to revert any progress making you wonder why anything happened at all.  These also seem to be decisions the production studio made over the author&#039;s original work. Anyone who steps back and thinks about their own relationships will be frustrated at the simplistic nature of how the characters interact with the plot.<br />
<br />
In the latter half of the anime spirals into the slice of life category until the end. There is even an episodic half episode mixed in which was questionable. Some of the episodes are also entirely devoted to developing Kaori&#039;s character just a tiny bit. A new character is introduced to help bring closure to Kaori&#039;s non-medical related amnesia twist. In fact, the last 3 episodes can be watched as a summary of everything this anime has to offer. Sadly there is no major resolution at the end of the anime.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Kids are as complex as adults and should not dumbed down as it only hurts the potential of this anime. The pacing of the anime could kill a corgi and the characters and anime studio are partly to blame.<br />
<br />
There are four characters. Hase and Kaori who are the protagonists. Kiryuu and Yamagishi&#039;s who are supporting characters. All the characters are weak in this anime because the supporting characters are the author&#039;s portrayal of the &quot;better half&quot; of Hase and Kaori due to how shallow Hase and Kaori are as characters by themselves. Perhaps if the author spent much more time fleshing out Hase and Kaori, this anime would be great with just two characters. Instead its clear that you need supporting characters so that you get the &quot;whole&quot; Hase and Kaori experience.<br />
<br />
Kaori in the first half of the anime flip flops between different personalities much to the viewers chagrin. Then halfway through she abruptly starts to develop her character and become more human which is a positive change.  Yet prior to that her interactions with her classmates (who were trash talking her) she comes off as meek and unwilling to confront or defend herself. It is difficult to understand who she really is which makes it hard to care. The result is a unwieldy heroine who&#039;s difficult to take seriously but unfortunately she&#039;s a better character than Hase. Why is this? She shows the most depth and development out of all the characters which is the most important aspect of an anime that revolves solely around people. Due to her amnesia trait and plot, she was bound to develop the most anyways. Despite all this, in the latter half you keep thinking she&#039;s going to say something of interest but it always ends up as fluff. <br />
<br />
Hase is a forgettable and weak male lead. He has a standard male sheepish personality who jumps to conclusions and makes assumptions rather than approaching an issue with reason. While this is an attribute many people may have and is seen as normal, the author forces his character to behave in a way which drags the plot down instead of adding to it. Worse, every time he starts getting weepy on the audience he seeks out Kiryuu who then, like clockwork, offers him the most simplest of rational advice. This really speaks volumes about Hase as a character. Kiryuu ultimately manifests as Hase&#039; other half. If Kiryuu was removed and Hase was given character development to seek understanding of his own emotions and follow the exact same rational advice, he would have the potential to outshine Kaori in the anime by far. As a side note, it seems the author cast Hase in a extremely naive and idealistic nature which isn&#039;t a bad thing except she (the author) combines this with unlikely events leading to breaks in immersion which again, is not good for an anime trying to deliver a strong story based on relationships. Also, author seems to be channeling her ex-boyfriend&#039;s jealously into this character because daaaaaamn, hes green, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are what make this anime even bearable. <br />
<br />
Kiryuu basically acts as the more mature, more laid back, less excitable, more logical, better half of Hase and Kaori. If Hase ever showed a bit of self consciousness or intelligence, it is manifested in Kiryuu. Or Kiryuu will play the third wheel and provide advice to Kaori if there&#039;s a problem with Hase. People like Kiryuu in this anime because hes grounded, not because he&#039;s a good character though. Also due to the weakness of characters/plot, even he gets shipped with Yamagishi rather subtly in an effort to add development. This development is tacked on towards the end, probably because the author is attempting to salvage readership.<br />
<br />
Yamagishi, the female counterpart to Kiryuu, is one of those light headed possibly lesbian (to attract more viewers) girls who wears her heart on her sleeve (unlike crazy Kaori&#039;s split personality). Yamagishi also has a &quot;forgetful&quot; problem but unlike the twist that Kaori has, its closer to absentmindedness, a standard anime character trait. Her role in this anime is to act as a counterpart to Kaori, and fill in the void that Kaori&#039;s character fails to do (provide comic relief). She also enters the anime halfway through, at a time when the anime is starting to suffer from a lack of &quot;things happening&quot;. In other words, this character&#039;s value is unable to stand alone and who&#039;s purpose is to prop up the plot itself at the same time while providing contrast to Kaori. Again, if Yamagishi was merged into Kaori, I think this anime would have had much stronger protagonists and a much more creative outcome rather than relying on happenstance. Then again, if they merged, their laugh would be &quot;Teehee ehehehue&quot;, creepy.<br />
<br />
Art: Pastel colors and fits the anime well, perhaps to complement how bland it is. <br />
<br />
Sound: Not bad but not memorable. Fits the anime well however.<br />
<br />
Want something that has relationships, romance, and a great deal more done better? Nodame Cantabile. Or a number of other anime I could easily recommend over One Week Friends for the relationship category.

    I have watched a fair amount of anime in the last couple months and my most enjoyed genre is slice of life/romance. I barely come around to writing reviews but I made the exception with Isshuukan Friends. ( I.F for future shortening). I remember looking at this anime on the anichart website. The description gave good premise of what was going to be and the hook for this fish (being me obviously :P) was that the main girl Kaori forgets her friends every Monday. <br />
<br />
Once it aired I was watching it contently and awaited each week for a new episode to air. The characters were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148403">
        wonderful and the dialogue and banter between the characters so innocent and pure. The art style was stand out in my eyes as it almost looked like it was a watercolour painting half the time. The music was nice albeit not memorable but I think the overall plot and production values make this a must see. <br />
<br />
I had a blast every week and this is what anime should be. I don&#039;t want to sit in frustration or anger. I want to be happy for the people in this world beyond my screen and this show managed that. I hope for a second season or even an OVA or two just to maybe give us some insight to their future as friends.

    In the world of anime we tend to expect the unexpected. Explosions? A fantastical world? Monsters? Super powers? Super kawaii moe characters? BOOBS!?!?!?!? In the world of anime, all of those seem to be normal and expected in a show. However, once and a while a show comes out that is “unusual” and includes NONE, that’s right, NONE of the aforementioned things. In anime, the usual is unusual, and what makes it even more unusual (confused yet?) is when it is as excellent and beautiful as Isshuukan Friends.<br />
<br />
Story - 7.8:<br />
Read the summary that MAL displays above and you will completely, 100% understand what the plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148015">
        of this show is. Its not a mind-bending psychological thriller, or an action-adventure with underlying political conflict. No. Isshuukan Friends’ story is as simple as the 2 sentences that MAL describes it with. Although simple, it is something that is rarely (if ever) seen in anime. A story based around someone trying to become friends with somebody else. What makes the story of this show amazing is its understanding of what it can do, and how to do it. The plot isn’t meant to keep you on the edge of your seat, it is meant to make you smile. Each episode has a handful of heartwarming moments that just make you feel all warm and gooey (and not the warm and gooey you might feel in your pants while watching hentai). Although the show easily could’ve gone a more melodramatic/depressing route due to its premise, it instead did something much more beautiful. The characters almost never pout and cry “why me!?!?!?! ToT,” instead they try to make the best out of their situation. Towards the end of the show a character was introduced that really was unnecessary, and the pacing of the show is very slow for all of you with short attention spans. However those few negatives hardly scratch the simple beauty of this story. <br />
<br />
Art - 7.7:<br />
The artstyle in this show is very reminiscent of the artstyle found in Usagi Drop partially due to the character designs and partially due to the simplicity. I have to point out that there is no fanservice whatsoever as far as I can remember which I found to be refreshing in the panty shot filled world of anime. For such a simple show, they really do go out of their way to make a variety of locations and pay good attention to all the background characters in each scene. Really the art was just beautiful and perfectly fitting to the feel of the show and there really isn’t much to nit-pick about it. It wasn’t jaw-droppingly amazing like a Fate/Zero but it was fantastic none the less and has to be commended for its beauty.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7.6:<br />
Isshuukan Friends’ OST was very fitting of the show. I wouldn’t say it was good enough to listen to without the visuals from the anime, but it was definitely good and set the mood for each scene perfectly. The show knows when to keep the music down, and when to just not even have music. I must note that I personally loved the OP and ED songs and thought they were some of the best in a season where there were plenty of noteable OPs and EDs. What was easily more impressive than the OST in this show was the voice acting. There is a wide variety of personalities in this show, and the cast fits these characters wonderfully. There are A LOT of shows where I can’t tell the difference between characters voices due to my lack of familiarity in Japanese language. However, this show easily let me distinguish the characters from each other even if one wasn’t in the shot. In short: OST was good, VAs were better. Very good job.<br />

Characters - 8.1:<br />
As I said earlier, there are a wide array of personalities in this show. The characters might not seem it, but when it comes down to it, they are all archetypes. You have your shy/kind girl in Fujimiya, your innocent/nice/slightly pussy main character in Hase, your ditsy/moe/awesome sidekick girl in Yamagishi, and your male tsundere/bro in Kiryuu. Like I said before though, you probably won’t notice this on the surface. The characters are all extremely easy to like and they all grow from one episode to the next (except Fujimiya cuz her brain has problems… jk she does too). This show absolutely would not have worked if any one of the main 4 characters were removed or replaced with someone else, and they all keep the balance of the show steady. Yes, they were all archetypes, but they were all pretty damn good archetypes and one of my personal favorite overall casts of main characters in anime. The side characters were pretty good, although for the most part out of the picture which is a slight shame, because Kaori’s mom was pretty fucking awesome. Also…. Hajime Kujou was absolutely unnecessary and annoying. That aside, the characters in this show were superb.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8.0:<br />
So if you’ve made it this far in the review it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed the hell out of this show. There were plenty of shows I liked this season (No Game No Life, Kawaisou, Captain Earth to name a few), but none had me as excited to watch the next episode as Isshuukan Friends. It didn’t have that next level enjoyment that equates to me either shitting myself out of excitement or crying my eyes out due to sadness, but this show made me smile from ear to ear a countless amount of times.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.84:<br />
It’s interesting that my two favorite shows of the Spring season this year are complete opposites. Where No Game No Life is the quintessential anime experience (fantasy world, fanservice, over the top characters, action, etc.), Isshuukan Friends is just a simple tale of friendship. No it wasn’t ground-breaking, and yes it did have it’s flaws (I’m looking at you Hajime Kujou), but Isshuukan Friends is still a MUST WATCH for all.<br />
<br />
The Verdict:<br />
The simplicity of Isshuukan Friends led by wonderful characters and beautiful production create a true piece of art that never fails to bring a smile to the viewer’s face. <br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+ Extremely loveable characters<br />
+ Story doesn’t pour on the melodrama<br />
+ Makes me happy<br />
+ Art and Sound departments perfectly match the show<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Unnecessary addition of a character near the end<br />
- Kaori’s mom didn’t get her spotlight<br />
<br />
If you liked Isshuukan Friends, watch:<br />
Usagi Drop<br />
ef: A Tale of Memories<br />

7.76/10 - Great

    Isn&#039;t it simply frustrating to overcome all your fears, work really hard, only to be sent back to square one? Isn&#039;t it absolutely irking when you try to remember something but no matter how hard you think, you can&#039;t remember?<br />
<br />
Romance is supposed to be simple...right? Is it, then, complex? Meet, be happy, fight, makeup, be even more in love? <br />
<br />
In Isshuukan Friends by Hazuki Maccha, no easy ending lays in sight for the main couple as the two polar opposites struggle with not only their own character and problems, but with reality as well.<br />

<br />
From the beginning to the end, One Week Friends provides a refreshing view of an overused archetype in not only anime but drama as well--memory loss. Despite the seemingly lackluster plot, the presentation of the characters and their struggles is utterly heartwarming and at some moments, tear jerking. <br />
<br />
The art style is nothing much to mention: simple and sweet. The animation is fluid but feels slow at times, but the pace of the plot is fine as is. Sometimes, however, it does feel like the plot seems rushed, but only at brief moments that in no way disturb from the flow and organization of the anime. <br />
<br />
The characters are well rounded and developed throughout the show. Through the strain of a friendship to a complete and full repair, the male main character learns to overlook and overcome his possessiveness and realizes his friend&#039;s supportive nature even more as he pursues the female main character in a romantic relationship. <br />
<br />
While labeled a Shounen work, this piece is suitable for all ages and all audiences. <br />
<br />
If you are looking for a break from watching your main anime category, be it action, survival, horror, or whatnot, I assure you that this piece will not disappoint for its money&#039;s worth. <br />
<br />
Genuinely heartwarming and concise, 4.5 stars out of 5 for Hazuki Maccha&#039;s Isshuukan Friends. <br />

    Welcome to another Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews! Today we&#039;re working over the subbed version of Isshuukan Friends. We have a charming little series here, with a few issues that truly keep it from rising to the heights it might have otherwise achieved. Let&#039;s take it from the top. <br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
I&#039;m not saying I disliked the series at all, in fact I found it quite charming. There is, however, one MAJOR flaw that must be addressed as it is the focal point of the entire show, all the way down to what the series is called, that being the female lead&#039;s amnesia. The condition itself can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340601">
        be somewhat rare in real life, and almost never works in the manner depicted in fiction, but that&#039;s okay, as a story is, well, a story, yet this time we have a version of amnesia that truly stretches the suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. Our girl has the unique trait of forgetting her social interactions after each week. This appears to only affect her dealings in interpersonal interactions, as she&#039;s not shown to have any trouble with her studies in school, or in any other way. She simply goes to bed Sunday night, and Monday morning she has completely forgotten everyone she&#039;s interacted with the previous week. This of course puts her into a deep depression, and the entire show is built around trying to move her forward and bring the joy of friendship back into her life. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty laid back on many things, but this issue was a bit of a stickler for me. If it had been portrayed differently, perhaps with a more &#039;complete&#039; form of amnesia, such as what affected Haruka in Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, then I would have given this series a solid &#039;8&#039;, no problem at all. Yet with the girl only forgetting her friends and nothing else, I just couldn&#039;t roll with that completely without it troubling me. However, as it was clearly just a mechanic to set up the story about the power of friendship and learning to open up to others so I didn&#039;t let it discourage me from watching. A minor *SPOILER* here, later in the show it is lightly suggested that perhaps our girl&#039;s memory problems are the result of psychological trauma and not any physical one, but this is only tapped on briefly and then never explored. In the end, there is no resolution on if she truly forgets because actual brain damage, or if she forgets as an emotional response similar to something like PTSD. *END SPOILER*<br />
<br />
The other primary issue I had with this series was that as it wrapped up, the main guy makes a rather perplexing leap in logic in regards to the main girl&#039;s condition. It seemed a bit forced to me, there to pad out the series and give one last dramatic thrust. <br />
<br />
So with that, let&#039;s talk about what is good here. This series is driven by our main guy who notices a loner girl in his class and decides to reach out to her. He bravely approaches her, and even when she holds him at arm&#039;s length at first, continues to befriend her. His efforts are rewarded as he does break through her self imposed exile, and learns of her condition. He helps her move forward, helps her find a way to make her continuously lost memories more permanent, and in doing so, helps her be the person she truly is, and helps her rise from her shell of depression into the light of life. <br />
<br />
The story speaks to the fact that no one is without value, even the weird quiet person at school or work are still people, and maybe they are just in a situation that forces them into their behavior. Maybe they are just introverts who are too shy to seek out friendship with others. No matter the cause, everyone has value in the world, and even to others. As a famous author once wrote, &quot;no man is an island&quot;. That is quintessentially true, as humans are social creatures by nature. There is something admirable about reaching out to those who are, for whatever reason, isolated. <br />
<br />
I come to this subject with a strong personal view. I was always the loner, I am even today. I don&#039;t have many friends, I&#039;m very shy and introverted, and I generally shy away from social situations. I am speaking of &#039;real life&#039; as one would say, as here at my keyboard I feel I can truly be myself. But IRL it is easy to say I&#039;m a bit of a hermit and always have been. I&#039;ve had times when I wanted to be included or wanted to befriend someone but didn&#039;t know how, or couldn&#039;t summon the courage to step forward, and it hurt. There have been people in my life, however, that came to me and said &#039;hey, I want to get to know you, I think we could be great friends&#039; that have brought a good deal of joy to my life. I am not dismissing the idea that there is sometimes a level of annoyance involved, as some of us prefer to be left alone for the most part, there is still beauty in someone, who has honest intentions, taking an interest in us. Even if I decide I don&#039;t want to socialize with that person reaching out to me, if they are doing so for the right reasons, then they still gain a good deal of my respect. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not saying everyone has to be a social butterfly. What I am saying is that some people are alone when they don&#039;t want to be. This is clearly the case in this story, as the main girl is obviously miserable until the main guy moves to become her friend. The fact the main guy continues to try to be her friend even after learning of her weekly memory problem speaks to his honest heart. He isn&#039;t willing to just walk away because it&#039;s a bigger struggle to befriend the girl than other people. He sincerely wants to help her, and that is where the charm of the entire series really emanates from. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t romantically motivated either, though the main guy does want a very special friendship, it&#039;s never indicated that he is thinking in any way of a romantic one. He just wants to be an important friend to her, as she becomes an important friend to him. It&#039;s through the efforts of the main guy that the girl is granted the life and friends she thought she would never have. The struggles everyone faces with the main girl is truly the meat of the series, and makes a satisfying meal, as long as you can see past the weird amnesia issue. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
I would call this title&#039;s art &#039;simple and clean&#039; if I had to put it shortly. There&#039;s not a huge amount of detail forced in, but the story doesn&#039;t require it anyway. By going with lighter details and a cleaner look, small touches like blushes are more apparent, and speak a lot more clearly than some of the more &#039;busy&#039; art forms. The look works for the story well, and I don&#039;t find much to fault in it. I find the views on the artwork to be the most subjective, and I do tend to prefer the more detailed series, so I say &#039;7&#039;, which by scale is still good. Your mileage may vary. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
I did enjoy the voice work in the show. The main guy sounds honest and sincere, and the main girl is appropriately bubbly once we learn her true personality. The rest of the cast is well done, though they do go with not one, but two rather monotone characters, one of each gender. The supporting guy is played as an aloof but wise personality, whereas the supporting girl is played more as a humorous deadpan. They both work, just not too often have I heard the &#039;flat&#039; voiced character be more than a single person in most titles. <br />
<br />
The music is pretty, the opening and closing themes match the sentiment and movement of the show nicely. The music is either airy and vaguely reassuring or is deep-keyed and mournful, which is exactly what the show calls for. Sound effects all hit, no wonky sounds to be heard anywhere. <br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
Our main guy does seem to be too honest and good hearted at times, like he&#039;s putting in a level of effort that at first seems a bit excessive. His determination is admirable, but I did find myself at first wondering what was in it for him. This quickly dissipates as we see how wonderful a person the main girl is, and we quickly know that he continues to try because she is a great friend once she is reoriented with her relationship to him. Otherwise he&#039;s played off as a good person.<br />
<br />
His supporting guy is, as I said, aloof but even though he puts on a tough act, his advice is pretty much always spot on, and while blunt, is truthful. He might act like he doesn&#039;t care about any of the things going on, but I believe we are shown that deep down he does. He just plays the &#039;whatever man&#039; role, but he doesn&#039;t actually believe it himself. <br />
<br />
The main girl is beautiful and tragic at the same time. When we see her in her states of loneliness and isolation, it&#039;s almost painful, but once she brought up to speed with who her friends are, she opens up and is just a joy to watch. She&#039;s kind hearted, and tender, and cares deeply for her friends. In a way, even her self imposed isolation is in the spirit of protecting those that would be her friend. Watching her move from this spirit of fear and hopelessness to a world where she can be as normal a girl as possible is enchanting. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Watching the main guy do his best to befriend the main girl is the admirable hook, and then watching his good deed enrich another&#039;s life draws one in even more. Watch the main girl learn to live again is the payoff, and is worth it, without a doubt. As I said before, the reason this isn&#039;t an &#039;8&#039; at least is the memory problem itself. I find it to be distracting enough that some scenes that were meant to be moving left me slightly annoyed because the arbitrary amnesia rules seemed at times to be there to complicate the situation and not for any other reason. However, I do recommend seeing this show, as it was a great story of personal growth and the love of friendship. It tries to show us that we should care for each other, and that friendship isn&#039;t all about what *you* get from it, but instead what *you* give to it as well. It&#039;s a great message in a nice little series. <br />

Best Girl: I kind of wanted it to be Saki, but in the end, our main girl Kaori has to be the winner. She&#039;s just so adorable when she&#039;s out of her shell, and so heartbreaking when she&#039;s in it, I just came to love seeing her blossom over and over again, and watching as she overcame her challenging life. <br />
<br />
So yeah, this is the one week anime version of 50 First Dates, but it doesn&#039;t fall nowhere near as flat as Adam Sandler&#039;s film did. I say spin it up, don&#039;t let the memory thing drive you off (though it is damn annoying at times) and see if you can remember this one next week. I know I will!

    Amongst other anime, this anime only rely s on 1 heroine and that&#039;s what makes it special. The plot of the story is quite unique and fragile because the MC is trying to build a strong relationship with the heroine, however the plot is unique in this stage as the heroine always loses her memory of her friends. <br />
<br />
What really caught my attention was the unique plot behind the content, its not some regular romantic comedy series it has a strong and confined plot to it. It brough me to tears as the MC learns that all his hard work goes to waste as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review155715">
        heroine&#039;s memory resets weeky.<br />
<br />
It is a true taste of a very fragile relationship, every episode got deeper and deeper and the thoughts and actions were just so memorable.<br />
<br />
The anime had quite the good ending, but kinda lame one. <br />
<br />
Overall a very unique romantic series very touching to the heart.

    One Week Friends is a cute, slice of life story that pulls at your heartstrings. Yes, this series does center around the repetitive, selective amnesia plot device. I know it&#039;s been done before. You know it&#039;s been done before. That said, it&#039;s worth getting past just that into the story itself. Plot devices are recycled constantly, and One Week Friends did a good job of making me care about the characters and their feelings very quickly. You initial response might be to recoil because of an overused plot device, but you&#039;d be missing out if you let that alone make you avoid this series. It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169549">
        a plot device, and this series did a really good job of dragging me through the highs and lows with the characters using it. <br />
<br />
In a way, you know what you are getting pretty quickly with One Week Friends. The male lead is determined to become “friends” with the female lead, who each week loses the memories of her friends for some unknown reason. Despite repeated setbacks, the two stumble along the path to a closer relationship. I actually enjoy the supporting characters in this series. Compared to most series that have a lot of one dimensional “friend” support characters, the supporting characters have their own feelings, concerns, and interests. Even minor characters just summoned to do their bit parts seem to mesh into the story for their scenes. Everyone ends up likable. <br />
<br />
The art style is definitely cutesy and subdued. There is some well done scenery as well. I can see the style being subjective to someone&#039;s tastes...and there were times I felt like the characters looked and felt younger than their stated ages because of it, but hey I guess that&#039;s just this anime&#039;s thing. It&#039;s not bad looking though, so just go with it is what I would say. It fits with the pure feelings of the story. If you&#039;re looking for fan service you won&#039;t find anything though. It&#039;s not that kind of anime. The music supports the same mood, generally being light and cheerful during the highs, and tense and anxious during the lows, but always measured and subdued to the point of not overwhelming everything else. <br />
<br />
In the end, I&#039;d say One Week Friends accomplished for me what I think it was setting out to do, get at your heartstrings at tug at them. If you&#039;re looking for a cute, emotional “love” story then this will definitely get the job done. Nothing revolutionary here, but it works.

Wow, I can&#039;t believe this Anime is done.. I started watching this anime when it was in its 4th episode,<br />
I found that i would catch up with the series on the same night.<br />
<br />
At first I have to say, I was confused as of why I was so intrigued by this show. As the show went on and on, I realized it was of how cute it was. Yuki Hase and Kaori Fujimiya have such a chemistry that one can only wish for. It is as if the creators wanted to make these two as cute as possible. And unlike most Anime Cliches Yuki

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148401">
        was actually aware of all of Kaori&#039;s feelings, and wasn&#039;t a pervert not even in the smallest sense. For example, when they went to the beach, most anime guys would be totally stoked to see the girl in a bikini. Yuki was just happy to be there with Kaori. The relationship between these two has to be one of the best relationships in history.<br />
<br />
It is the little things too that make this anime enjoyable. The beautiful scenery, the innocence of the two main characters, 18 grams of sugar, Shogo and Saki&#039;s relationship, how Kaori&#039;s memory starts to get better, the way the Ending song slowly fades in. In the end these all added up to make a masterpiece, and i never once felt bored watching this anime, in a world where I have trouble sitting through an episode, this anime was an exception. I would close facebook, twitter, shut off my phone, and lock myself in my room to avoid distractions. Everytime the credits rolled I would get sad that it was over so quickly and often times rewatch the episode. <br />
<br />
I would finally love to recommend this show to everyone. Now that all 12 episodes are out, i&#039;m sure many will stumble across this anime and watch it all in one sitting. I will now start another run trough, of the many more to come. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you enjoy this anime as much as i did.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d like us to be friends!

    Let me be totally honest with you. There&#039;s no real love story in Isshuukan Friends. You can easily describe all the feelings and interactions between main characters as &#039;love&#039;, but they actually put themselves in a &#039;friend-zone forever&#039; situation. I keep wondering myself, if it&#039;s all because of memory loses, or because Hase was just a wet-rag.<br />
<br />
The story is really mediocre, but that&#039;s doesn&#039;t make it bad. I can really describe it only with the words &#039;long-wided&#039; and &#039;caramelized&#039;. It can be boring at times, but is always warm and heart-melting.<br />
<br />
The artstyle it what cought my eyesight at the firstplace, and it really lived up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177555">
        all my expectations. The characters and surroundings are colourful and well-drawn in general. Not much to say about the sound, but I find, that all the voices fit their characters perfectly.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t rumble about Hase, because I just don&#039;t like those genki-type but somewhat shy and always failing characters. I was really admiring the stoic and cold-minded Shougo though, those two made a great contrast. <br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed Isshuukan Friends, but I still feel a bad about the relationship just hovering at one point. By the way, I was really surpised by the little scene with Hase at the end. Does he, by any chance, have the same memory problem as Kaori, or is my imagination playing a bad trick on me?..

    &quot;You eat your octupus weiners feet first.&quot;<br />
-Kaori Fujimiya, Episode 8<br />
<br />
50 First Dates, the anime! This show began with much promise, and was interesting to watch, but just seemed to fall apart towards the end. It got to the point where I was hoping there would be an unfortunate ending. (the resolution provided was very unsatisfying)<br />
<br />
One of my biggest complaints is about the two main characters, Hase and Kaori (I don&#039;t remember people&#039;s full names because more often than not, they&#039;re not memorable). They both start off as decent-enough characters, but they become annoying with time.<br />
75% of the time Hase is talked to, he will respond

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190677">
        in a generic surprised way (ex. &quot;W-Where did that come from?&quot;). This might seem like a minor detail, but trust me, it will get annoying.<br />
After Kaori [major plot event], everything she does seems so fake, even to the point where the other characters can tell. I get that it&#039;s part of the story, but it&#039;s just so bland and irritating.<br />
It happens too often in anime when all it takes is just one character to screw everything up..<br />
<br />
The art style was rather interesting for the most part, but sometimes it was almost impossible to tell what expression someone was making due to the lack of visible mouths.<br />
<br />
Overall, this was a good show that just became a bit bland towards the end. It wasn&#039;t bad by any means, but it was a bit upsetting to see it falter so. I probably would&#039;ve rated it the same score even if it had been different, despite my previous criticism. Still, this show won&#039;t leave much of a lasting mark..

    (My english is HORRIBLE, so I&#039;m really sorry if reading my review will give you a cancer. Really.)<br />
<br />
Maybe as so much people, I watched Isshuukan Friends because everybody said that&#039;s a really really REALLY good anime. But... NONONONONONONONONONONONONONO, no, please, NO.<br />
<br />
I wasted my time and I hope you&#039;ll not make the same mistake.<br />
<br />
The chara-design is HORRIBLE (all in this anime is horrible, in fact) and I think I don&#039;t need to explain why : the faces are the same and not really developed (any details), the mouth is small, the nose... Jesus, but just : where&#039;s the nose? e-e<br />
<br />
About the story itself, I don&#039;t know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180425">
        what to say because there&#039;s NOT story. You can watch the first episode and just after, watch the last without screaming to spoil yourself. It&#039;s literally boring.<br />
<br />
In fact, the 80 % from the anime is around (is it right to say that?) a romance, but the romance... No. I can&#039;t. It&#039;s too simple-minded (I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s the good word, sry) : the characters are about 17yo and they worry about who much grams of sugar they need to get in their omelets. Seriously? And OF COURSE, the relationship doesn&#039;t progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I can&#039;t understand why so much peoples seems loooove this anime (ah and if you asked yourself if the end is at least sad, etc., no. I&#039;m girl and I&#039;m on periods and I don&#039;t feel any sadness. Don&#039;t waste your time.)

    So I&#039;ll start by saying what would of made the show a 10 out of 10 for me. <br />
The brain is a very complex part of the human body that we still today do not know everything about. <br />
Sigmund Freud was the first to scratch the surface. <br />
Modern day we have neuroscience. <br />
<br />
It would been really awesome if they went psychology route but you really can&#039;t expect a fluffy cute anime to dive into advance psychology. It is beyond most people&#039;s general knowledge. <br />
I&#039;m not going to penalize the show that much for that. It just would of been a big bonus.<br />
The show just gives

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212100">
        us that she was in accident and she suffered a brain injury that most likely affected the cerebellum. It is left up for your imagination.<br />
<br />
When you look at the tags of the show. <br />
There is no drama or romance tag. The selling point of the show is it&#039;s cuteness. <br />
So what this means is that I&#039;m not expecting romance from the show. It still makes you disappointed of what could of been but it should not irritate you because it is something you were conditioned for. <br />
<br />
The main draw is it&#039;s cuteness. <br />
The main draw of the show is Kaori Fujimiya.<br />
My first impressions of her were that she was cold and kawaii and I loved her. <br />
During episode 3 we saw a drastic change from her and at the time I felt that the change between cold and normal was too abrupt. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the story did address this being that she acts emotionless so that people would avoid talking to.<br />
This is something that I can relate to when I was going through my early years of my depression. I did the same thing. I was very emotionless walking through the hallways because i didn&#039;t want anyone to approach me.<br />
I wanted to give off the illusion that I was unapproachable but when once someone actually starts talking to me a switch turns on and I&#039;m my more friendly self. <br />
So anyone who felt that it was unrealistic character change, I beg to differ. <br />
<br />
The main plot of the show was Kaori Fujimiya writing in her diary to remember or for better words be informed of what was happening around her the last week. <br />
This is not something that was made up for this anime. This is actually the same theory used to remember dreams. <br />
<br />
Every night you will dream 4 times. <br />
Will you remember all of them? No. <br />
Do you sometimes remember one? Yes, and it is usually the last dream you were having. <br />
I know you can remember countless times you&#039;ve had a really cool dream and you do something like take a piss and poof the dream gone after that.<br />
The dream has returned to your unconscious, the same unconscious that all of Kaori Fujimiya memories are trapped. <br />
<br />
So by writing your dreams right when you wake up in the morning in a journal. <br />
You will actually remember more of them.<br />
Your able to tap into that unconscious like Kaori Fujimiya is tapping into hers slowly during the show. <br />
Why she eventually feels naturally that it is Hase on Monday.<br />
<br />
At this point I was thinking that this show could be an 8 out of 10. <br />
Like I said, if it went the psychology route it would of been a potential 10 out of 10 at this point. <br />
Then they did do something that irritated me with Kaori Fujimiya resetting after her reunion with Kayo. Pressing the reset button is one of my pet peeves. I find it lazy writing and it didn&#039;t lead to any pay-off.<br />
<br />
Then of course it would of been nice if not just Kaori Fujimiya and Yuuki Hase became a couple. Also Shougo Kiryuu and Saki Yamagishi as well.<br />
What it really comes down to it, what is the reason for them to not?<br />
There isn&#039;t a reason. It makes complete sense for them to all end up being couples at the end of show and none of them are. <br />
So you are left disappointed but to circle back to the beginning. I can&#039;t be irritated about it but I can&#039;t negate it either. <br />
Do not go into this show wanting romance, it is destined to fail for you. <br />
<br />
The final result is this landing as an above average show (7 out of 10). <br />
There was a lot of miss opportunities that could of made this show special.
