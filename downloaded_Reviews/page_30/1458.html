    I tried to like this. I really, really did. I was even sticking out for it upon its announcement because for all of the problems earlier iterations of SAO had, there was always a sense that, if the finer details were checked over and looked at in complete retrospect of what came before, it could be deservedly fun, inspiring or genuinely meaningful. A series deserving of the immeasurable hype phenomenon it generated. Escapism, blurring between actions of reality and fiction was always a thematic that separated the series from the many isekais this decade that followed in its footsteps, and something that held my interest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304877">
        in how it would be handled, but aside from arguably the Mother’s Rosario arc, this wasn’t given enough space in the narrative between all the superfluous anime tropes that seem to be there to draw the most general audience possible. Look no further than the original Aincrad arc, praised most by anime-only fans for its concepts, but forcibly rushed to completion when its author chose to submit a word limited contest draft as the first novel, compared to refining the fully story he wanted to make.<br />
<br />
Sword Art Online’s biggest problem is itself. <br />
<br />
Its writer, Reki Kawahara, keeps getting in his own way, and when he doesn’t, the anime eschews his vision. What he wants to get across is almost always clear, and there are effortful attempts to act on those ideas, but with the anime’s focus on moving the plot forward rather than making details feel elaborately set, it ends up bringing down the entire experience to make watching the series weekly for the most part, feel like a slog of boring exposition attempting to cover up poor pacing of external events. If something from earlier is justified, it can feel annoyingly retroactive. Kirito himself is less a factor than in previous arcs, he is still partially to blame in the indistinct coverage of how this season adds to the themes of the franchise.<br />
<br />
General spoilers for the season below:<br />
<br />
The main premise of this arc is that Kirito, while on a date with his girlfriend Asuna, is caught off guard and stabbed to near death by one of the three Death Guns from the previous season. While in a coma, he ends up in the digital world of Rath, a system used for a military experimentation project where he must do..............................nothing in particular at no real urgency. There is a plot, and there is a goal, but for once they feel entirely separate from the tension.<br />
<br />
But I’ll get to that later. SAO, being as popular as it is, has mostly being met with snark and derision from people calling it the “worst ever” or otherwise exaggerating the flaws of it, so I think it’s fair to start off with the positives of this season, because contrary to what haters will tell you, they do exist.<br />
<br />
1. Production value and music. These have been consistent strengths of the SAO series throughout the years and generally, they still hold up here. The character models take on the new polished style from the Ordinal Scale Movie, and while not having as much animation (I’ll get to that), the look is maintained very well across all 24 episodes of the show. If you compare to the original two seasons, there is a definite improvement, and while the architecture present isn’t particularly unique or standout, it is well presented. Likewise, Yuki Kajura’s music, while not her best soundtrack, still does what it can to set the mood for the quieter scenes and the action scenes, with a great new remix of Swordland to go along with it. Special mention to some of the opening moments of Episode 2, and the fight in Episode 16. Of the music outside of the show, the first OP and the second ED are the best ones and do have a good amount of catchiness and energy to them.<br />
<br />
2. Alice Schuberg, the arc’s new female lead. While it takes 16 episodes in to actually really explore her as a character, and she looks a lot like Saber from the Fate series, the time we do have from then on with her sets her as probably the most consistent female lead in SAO so far. As of yet, she’s hasn’t been subjected to an endless supply of ass shots, her growth hasn’t been stunted by time skips, nor is her growth entirely for Kirito’s sake. Her arc of rejecting the corrupt system she’s been brainwashed under, wanting to reconnect with her old life and opening up on her feelings is adequately handled and leads to some of the stronger character moments this season. She also has one of the coolest weapons in terms of both design and animation; a space bending sword acting as moving protection with golden butterflies as weapons. It’s been put to effective use in the fights so far and has potential to be used further as the story moves along.<br />
<br />
3. Measuring Kirito’s power. Compared to say, the Phantom Bullet arc, some of the worst aspects of his character are toned down. He doesn’t start the series overpowered from the get-go, has actual struggles in several fights and even takes a few Ls in a couple of them. It gives a couple of the fights in the season more tension than previous ones. The existence of Eugeo also helps for his sake since the show is better able to balance the battles between the two of them rather than giving Kirito the entire spotlight. It doesn’t mean there isn’t still an annoying amount of contrived solutions to conflicts, but that’s more on the writing than him specifically.<br />
<br />
4. Actually building the villain. The arc’s villain, a Knight Templar dictator calling herself Quinella, has an established backstory and a defined reason for ruling the way she does. We know why she is the villain, we see the clear consequences of her actions on the world and she isn’t as laughable to be taken seriously compared to say, Sugou from ALFheim. She’s a product of an as of now unknown evil seed, but nonetheless she’s established properly. However, showing her attractive naked body on screen doesn’t work at all to be alienating for a series that in the past used naked bodies during bath scenes as fanservice. There are some fun intensity moments with her in the climax, even if the battle is a mere two minutes long.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that’s the positives out of the way. Now for everything else that really breaks this arc and saddens me given the inherent potential of a SAO story.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem that persists throughout the entire show is the immeasurable focus on exposition over every other element. Characters will abandon the idea of development, fighting, talking, world building, or anything else for the opportunity to talk in technical terms about topics that, while somewhat relevant, are not as important as what else could be focused on. Eugeo, the new male lead, has got family issues? No, that&#039;s not important. We need to talk about the villain’s plan and “Fluctlights” (the series’ pretentious name for digital souls in an indistinct coverage of AI vs humans) again. Knowing how that works is way more important that a main character&#039;s backstory. The exposition often brings the narrative to a screeching halt, especially in scenes where the heroes stop fighting the villain and exposition for a few minutes while the villain just stands around waiting for them. <br />
<br />
Exposition is something inherent in building a setting and establishing the plot. I understand the use for it. There are several shows that have still been entertaining despite or because of their exposition. But SAO Alicization’s exposition is not only incredibly frequent but boring and lacking in character. It’s frequent enough to where Episode 1 spends 10 minutes just expositioning off vague terms about the setting, while half of Episode 12 and nearly all of Episode 13 are nothing but this flat delivery of the plot. Other episodes tend to tag nearly every fight with exposition that’s 8 times longer than the fight itself. While the old director was no exemplar by any means, he at least knew how to make fights seem varied and exciting visually with a lot of movement. Here, Yuki Kajiura puts in the effort, but this new director who directed some of the worst LN adaptations in recent memory like Mahouka and The Asterisk War, just cannot pull it off. So, when the OP makes you think you’ll be getting this epic fight, it’s usually just maybe two attacks apiece preceded and followed by 5-10 minutes of exposition. <br />
<br />
The framing device of the season also presents several issues this time around. The idea that Kirito’s exploration in this new world is happening while his real-world body is comatose could generate tension, but this alongside Kirito’s connection to the real world is poorly substantiated. In learning about this framing device, we, as the audience, know it is just a waiting game for Kirito to heal up and be back to normal. Until the very last episode, his actions in Rath have absolutely no consequences in the real world. None of that “die in the game die in real life” stuff here. He gets really hurt from time to time but we have no idea how his real body is taking it. There’s a two-year timeskip at one point, but unlike in Season 1 where it really was two years, we have no idea how much the time exchange is between the system and the real world which I think hurts the connection to the story. This framing device also separates Kirito from his past connections in this story. I don’t mind the reduced role of his entourage for the moment (even if Asuna, who SHOULD be important, has nothing to do right now), but he barely brings them up over what’s been at least two years. There was one moment Kirito thought of his real-world connections, but that was for a poorly animated fight that ended in a draw and had absolutely no effect going forward. Kirito cries more over the fact that flowers he planted were destroyed (that were contrivedly brought back anyways) than even the chance that he might NEVER see Asuna again being stuck for so long. I want to care, but the show refuses to let me with a framing device that undermines the events and severs past connections.<br />
<br />
Other old habits die hard, whether because of Kawhara’s own writing or the adaptation. Not only do we get another ridiculous rapey scene, but there’s a two-year timeskip rather than say, actually seeing Kirito and Eugeo train up to be better swordsman. They set off for the Capital and the next we see them, BOOM, two years pass, and they’ve already had a lot of training done. They could’ve at least done an FMA03 type thing by building character relationships prior to a timeskip but nope, nearly all relationships at the sword academy are shown after and as of now, doesn’t matter to anything since we know so little about them. If this was better in the light novel, good for Kawahara, but perhaps it should’ve been a cause for concern seeing how much got cut for the anime onlys. In this adaptation, the only purpose of the sword academy stuff, aside from telling us Kirito and Eugeo became better swordsmen offscreen, was to build two bullies as irredeemable rapey monsters, and paint two cute girls as victims of this. We don’t know much about them either, aside from one of them having a romance arc with Eugeo that goes absolutely nowhere. There’s also a lot of contrivances to make progress, like with Kirito seeing the “ghost” of Alice in Episode 4 lead him the right way, how Cardinal is introduced into the story specifically to ex Machina Kirito and Eugeo out of a scene, and how Kirito uses a completely unknown attack to one shot a late-game villain that returns him to his Black Swordsman coat for a bit. This attack is never referred to by name and never mentioned again. <br />
<br />
And it’s not like this progress has done well for the characters, as Alice aside, they range from passable to horribly flat. Kirito isn’t as overpowered as before, but aside from problems the framing device puts on him, he still has annoying moments, like one case where he retroactively Sherlocked his way to avoid being poisoned, or where he used a device he only had two of on a character he barely knew, rather than to potentially stop the villain and save Alice. The show puts him in the right for this by the way, and there’s not much of an arc for him this season either. Cardinal is actually pretty decent, even if the show’s use of her as an ex Machina isn’t for the best. The sword academy characters are barely developed at all, and among the antagonists, only Bercouli and Deusolbert are passable; the rest are just obnoxious. Fanatio’s only character trait is being ashamed of being a woman, which falls deaf when both the main villain and Alice, whom she knows personally, are also women, as well as there being no indication of gender division in the world. And Chudelkin’s only purpose is to ruin the tone and make rapey faces whenever possible until kill stealing at the end.<br />
<br />
Which leads us to the biggest wasted potential so far, Eugeo. There was a lot of potential for his character at the start. Being a guy partner to help balance Kirito out of the spotlight, there was a lot Kawahara could do with what he distinctly did not know about Kirito, his personal relationships with him and Alice as kids, his fighting ability, the idea that he has more innate fighting potential than Kirito, his unawareness of being an AI program and his romantic relationship to Tiese. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, not one of these elements get to shine in this adaptation to let us in on his blank sheet personality. Perhaps improved in the light novel, but the anime should have better stood on its own. Him having more innate potential than Kirito is completely ignored later on, his sword training is told not shown, and anything the show tries to pull regarding his relationships with Kirito/Alice as kids, his family, or Tiese fall completely deaf because they received little to no focus. He didn’t even TALK to Alice in the present day, once. The show would rather go into long tirades of exposition than show a main character’s backstory! Near everything about him was entirely cut short by the show despite having more than enough time to act on all of it. They try their best to make up for it at the end, but it’s a bit too little too late.<br />
<br />
It’s hard to say whether I’m more annoyed or disappointed with how Alicization has been executed so far. Sure, some of the problems in the world, characters and framing device can be fixed going forward, but first impressions are everything and this series did not make a good one. The focus on constant exposition over all else, the disconnected framing device, and lackluster character writing drag it down more than needed, but it could’ve been avoided if Kawahara just knew what to focus on or the anime didn’t skim over the better parts, since his ideas are abundantly clear. The SAO franchise can theoretically explore a lot, but it almost deliberately gets written into corners. That’s something I’ve always given SAO over the many works that have almost no effort at all to act on their ideas, and though there’s that chance for the future with new elements coming in to make the second half an improved experience, this season’s quality suggests it won’t be without a wide range of caveats.<br />

    In a world where popular light novels gets anime, manga, games, and hell, even live action movies, there’s one title I’m sure no anime fan can ignore. Sword Art Online. Becoming ever more popular and entering a mainstream line of anime adaptations, the franchise has also no doubt sparked decent deal of controversy. But hey, controversy sometimes makes cash right? <br />
<br />
It’s not rocket science to realize SAO would eventually get a continuation. It was just a matter of when and after 5 years since the second season, the time is now. Sword Art Online Alicization covers the light novels with an extended amount of material,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304864">
        much more than the previous season. It’s so much that in fact, a full 2-cour season of 24 episodes isn’t enough. Luckily, it has been confirmed the series would run more than that and given an additional season for its adaptation. However, the big question people should ask themselves if this is another SAO show to jump into or a cash grab at making more money.<br />
<br />
Starting with the prologue, we get a double length episode to give a general background of the new season. Make no mistake though as Alicization is not going to spoonfeed viewers with recapping. The show assumes you are familiar with the first two shows so anyone hoping to watch this needs to have completed the first two seasons. Light novel adaptations tends to suffer a lot from adaptation standards but thankfully, Alicization manages to deliver a faithful start with its character cast and storytelling. Besides Kirito, we are introduced to Eugeo, a new character who serves as his partner and best friend in this arc. Similar to Kirito, he has a kind heart although lacks experience in the beginning compared to him. He also appears somewhat cowardly in the beginning as he is unable to prevent certain events from happening, in particular for failing to help his childhood friend Alice. It’s not until he meets Kirito that he develops a resolve and finds the courage to become a stronger person. That is to say, Alicization features a lot of character bonding especially in the first half of the show. Eugeo begins to grow out of his shell after training and becoming strong enough to fight as a warrior. It really shouldn’t take long to realize that he has great potential, perhaps even someday of surpassing Kirito himself. As for Kirito, his personality remain largely the same in this season. That is, he is a selfless person who isn’t afraid to help others in need. Kirito and Eugeo develops great respect for each other and the latter even finds his resolve. The two sometimes almost feel like brothers. <br />
<br />
Outside of the duo, you may have noticed another prominent character being featured in the trailers or key visuals. Alice would be her name and she is Eugeo’s childhood friend. The show makes it clear that she is an important character from her introduction to later on in the story. Alicization also devotes time to developing her character after meeting Kirito. Despite having a rocky start, she develops respect and a growing trust for him. Now, people may have a curiousity if Alice become another ‘harem girl’ similar to some of the previous seasons. SAO is not a harem although it gives off a stench at times. Thankfully, there’s no need to worry. The closest that Alice seems to be with Kirito is when they are at the tower during one of the episodes and nothing more comes out of it. On the other hand, Kirito’s friends from the real world are still concerned about his well-being. In particular, Asuna searches for him through unorthodox methods while discovering some revelations about the technology in the real world. Remember, the world of SAO contains complex technology that defies the law of nature. I’m not even referring the VR system or robotics but rather the capability of influencing people’s lives. This extends to the virtual world where the Administrator managed to use system commands to reverse her own age. Sounds unbelievable, right?<br />
<br />
As with previous seasons, Alicization can’t be complete without antagonists and conflicts. One of the major antagonist in the new season is the Administrator, Quinella and her Integrity Knights. She’s an important character as not only is she a threat to the main protagonists but also a catalyst for some of the key events in this season. This includes character manipulation that extends to our new characters such as Eugeo and Alice. I’m not going to lie though, one of the events in this show is rather disturbing to watch considering the way she manipulates others. (I’m looking at you, Eugeo) On even more disturbing matters, we even have characters that commits unforgiveable sins that pushes Eugeo to the edge. It’s the type of event that brings controversy out of its fullest. I’m not going to spoil it but when you get to that particular episode, you’ll feel disgusted too. It’s so disturbing that it even changes Eugeo’s views on the laws of their world and causes him to rebel. Quinella herself also demonstrates a God-like complex with her own dark motives. If I said it once, I’ve said it a hundred times. She is detestable. I doubt anyone with a sane mind would find her character likable. <br />
<br />
I can’t be the only one to notice that the animation quality improved more than the previous seasons, right? The Ufotable-like animation is used in parallel with the Sword Art Online movie, Ordinal Scale. Not only did the animation style improve, it also managed to craft an imaginative virtual world to it its fullest. The character designs are also featured in great details compared to previous seasons. In particular, Alice is important to note for her chivalrous look and golden armor. Character expressions are meaningful with an emphasis put on human emotions. Eugeo is a prominent example especially as his personality shifts from a weak survivor to a noble swordsman. While I’m not impressed by how antagonist are portrayed this season, they were able to deliver their dialogues straight with a degree of villainous expressions. Quinella is the biggest culprit with her manipulative personality. Her malevolence simply cannot be overlooked.<br />
<br />
The SAO franchise is one of the longer light novel running adaptations that continues to build more into its universe. Truthfully and despite some of the controversy from the past seasons, this one managed to finally jump out of its rabbit hole and deliver what I wanted to see. With another season on the way, I cross my fingers that it will ride on this momentum.

    The anime community seems to be split in its opinion on SAO. Half of them ignore everything positive about it and only talk about negetive things. The other half just does the opposite. No other anime has been this controversial for more than 5 years after its original release. Now here is a new season that features mostly different cast from the original. So is it worth watching or not? Here is my analysis:-<br />
<br />
**THIS WILL INCLUDE MINOR SPOILERS ABOUT THE OVERALL SETTING **<br />
<br />
The story this time is centered not on a game, but around a simulation of civilization. The aim of this simulation is to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304862">
        develop highly advanced A.I capable of thoughts and emotions. It brings about some ethical questions about humanity, playing God, and where to draw the line in scientific experiments. This season deals with more of these mature themes than the previous seasons ever did.<br />
<br />
The premise is that Kirito finds himself in a medieval world with its own history and lore and journeys with his newfound friend Eugeo to achieve both of their (different) goals. It starts out slow, with a lot of focus on world building. Even though it seems disconnected to the plot of the previous seasons, eventually many plot points from before will make their way into the story. So it is important to watch the last seasons to get a full understanding of the current season.<br />
<br />
Eugeo is the focus of these two cours, Kirito just tagging along. He has an innocent, easygoing personality that makes the story work - much like Frodo from Lord of the Rings. He is the embodiment of a common citizen of Underworld. His opinions about himself, others and the society he is in changes throughout the story and the viewers get to experience the same things he does. Alice has not much role in the initial part, but her time for development will come in the 3rd and 4th cours.<br />
<br />
Unlike SAO&#039;s history, there is pain and blood in the fights. It makes the characters&#039; struggle believable and makes you root for the characters. Later on, the story gets even more darker without resorting to plain bloodshed - in a psychological way. Kirito is not overpowered in this arc. He only has the knowledge of a swordsman and works his way from the bottom up.<br />
<br />
The entire story is well thought out and is planned beforehand. There are several questions that arise in the early episodes - the answers are made clear slowly, as the plot progresses. Some of the things happened may seem irrelevant and random, but they make sense eventually.<br />
<br />
A large number of new characters are introduced in this season. Most of them influence main characters in various ways. The three main characters undergo some changes throughout the series and get some good character development. But the same cannot be said about the side characters.These characters last only for about 3 episodes and don&#039;t make an appearence till the 2nd part of this arc, but the gap is too long.<br />
<br />
The review will be incomplete if the villain is not mentioned. It is an ambitious character capable of easily manipulating others for personal gain that ended up turning into a different and dangerous entity due to an accident. Certainly there are better villains in the anime history, but this character is arguably the best villain SAO has seen so far. There is a moral ambiguity for this character.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of criticisms that can be offered as well. Some episodes have a lot of talking involved. A lot of exposition is delivered this way. People expecting all out action scenes will be disappointed or bored by these episodes. There is some pseudo-science explanation for the premise. It may not appeal to everyone.<br />
<br />
The tower climbing arc is adapted very poorly. The Integrity knights that are supposed to have their own reasons and understandings about the world around them are dumbed down to mere villains of the week. The cliffhangers are conceived in a very poor way. They feel forced and unnecessary because most of the fights are very short.<br />
<br />
The anime looks gorgeous with colorful shading - just like Ufotable. But the same can&#039;t be said about action sequences. In many action sequences, the frame of animation focuses only on one character. It makes the viewer unable to follow the fights well. The short fights are usually already ended by the time we get invested into them. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is underwhelming compared to the last seasons. Old music is repeatedly used by remixing it. Only few soundtracks are memorable and they don&#039;t last long. Some of them sound very similar to Yuki Kajiura&#039;s other works. Only new notable music is the Eugeo&#039;s theme and the Quinella&#039;s theme.<br />
<br />
The adaptation of the source material is below average. It is not butchered to Tokyo Ghoul Re&#039;s extent, but it is significantly rushed and cuts out a good amount of inner monologues that gives a good understanding of character relations and motivations. Think of the GGO arc that lasted for 14 episodes but now compress it into 8 episodes. That is how much rushed it actually is. Even so, everything that has happened can still be understood with some thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tl;dr - If you liked the previous seasons, it is a must watch.<br />
If you thought that the previous seasons were wasted potential then this is still worth watching as it explores a different theme - in far more detail.<br />
However if you didn&#039;t like the original characters of SAO, then better stay away from this season. Chances are that you will not like this season either.<br />
<br />
There is still two more cours to come. But that is a different entry in the database. Be informed that the story doesn&#039;t end yet.<br />
For me, what is great about this arc are its themes and execution, albeit the poor adaptation.

    Overpowered characters.<br />
<br />
From invincible action heroes to divinely powered chosen ones, <br />
from arbitrary powerup masters to &quot;willpower over logic&quot; crusaders,<br />
from technobabble technicians to omniscient pseudo-strategists, <br />
from plot-powered self-inserts to absurdly popular harem leads.<br />
<br />
Perfect in every conceivable way... except in terms of actually being well-written or compelling. And therein lies the problem with so many of them. Being overpowered is one thing, but they suffer from something far worse: being boring. They simply come across as bland and generic.<br />
<br />
And I am not referring to the fact that they crush their opponents with ease. What I am saying is that their personality, motivations and dialogue tend to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295441">
        dull. It is not just about the characters themselves though. It is rather that the way the narratives are written, these characters are not challenged to question their values or develop their wit in any significant way. They are not allowed to truly think.<br />
<br />
<br />
But don&#039;t just take my word for it. Let&#039;s hear it from the man himself:<br />
<br />
&quot;A human being&#039;s greatest power is to think. It&#039;s more powerful than any great sword or secret move.&quot;<br />
‒ Kirigaya Kazuto<br />
<br />
You know what? Kirito is right. This is precisely the main problem here. In Sword Art Online, the narrative too often focuses on swords and secret moves (read: plot-based powerups) over actual thought.<br />
<br />
And he must have first-hand experience. After all, Kirito is the patron saint of overpowered characters, and you probably know why. He is the best swordsman in the land by a wide margin. He obtains arbitrary powerups whenever the plot demands it. He has saved the day from random villains. He has won the affection of many girls for poorly established reasons. He knows random technical details that nobody else seems to. He might not be the absolute worst offender on the anime scene, but he is perhaps the most notorious, due to the runaway popularity of the franchise. <br />
<br />
But the true measure of a character is not his list of combat achievements but his personality, wit, moral struggle, perhaps even ideology.<br />
<br />
Kirito tends to selflessly save the day and help everyone. His antagonists are either comically evil or their motives are vague, incomprehensible, or otherwise poorly established. This is done so that we never have to question Kirito&#039;s moral superiority. He is the good guy, the hero, the shining knight. To enforce this, everybody seems to like him to an implausible degree, except for the aforementioned comically evil antagonists. Consider what this does to the narrative. Because most of Kirito&#039;s friends and associates adore him, there is little meaningful conflict between them, and meaningful conflict is at the heart of good narratives.<br />
<br />
And note that we are supposed to take all of this unironically. We are supposed to relate to a nigh-perfect protagonist who never has to struggle with any moral dilemmas of any kind because he is always placed in a position in which the antagonists are over-the-top evil or their motives are incomprehensible.<br />
<br />
And the emphasis is on &quot;placed.&quot; We don&#039;t usually get to see different sides of Kirito ‒ aside from his role as a heroic savior ‒ precisely because he is always placed in situations in which he is inclined to become a heroic savior. As I mentioned, he is facing sub-par villains, and he is also provided with the convenient opportunity to defeat them. This is precisely why he comes across as bland. At least, he has so far in the franchise.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what does Alicization do to change this? Maybe a little. The premise is a little less black-and-white than some of the previous iterations and presents some moral ambiguity, but it is still fairly clear which of the characters are intended as antagonistic. The narrative also reverts to old patterns in this respect sometimes. I&#039;ll get back to this later.<br />
<br />
There is also another notable issue. It seems as though the author sat down and figured, &quot;Hmm, you know what this show needs? More exposition infodumps.&quot;<br />
<br />
...which the show was never lacking in the first place and which does nothing to resolve the actual problems with the franchise. <br />
<br />
<br />
1) First, it is time for the glorious infodumps. <br />
<br />
To put it bluntly, this show comes with encyclopedic lists of technical details. So have fun with rants about Fluctlights, Stacia Windows, the Gigas Cedar, the High-Norkian Style, and the Light Quantum Gate Crystal. There is no shortage of these infodumps, and soon enough you notice that another episode is gone just like that.<br />
<br />
As an example, here is a quote from Kirito himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think the human soul is located? [...] The brain is more or less a clump of brain cells, right? So where among the brain cells does the soul exist? All cells, including brain cells, are supported by a structural network. Apparently, they&#039;re called microtubules. Tubes. In other words, hollow pipes. And there&#039;s something sealed inside those hollow pipes. [...] Light. Light. A fluctuating light photon. And that&#039;s what comprises the human soul, according to Rath.&quot;<br />
<br />
...What?<br />
<br />
Is that how it works? Given the context of the story, I am going to be generous and assume that &quot;soul&quot; is a metaphor for memories, personality and other mental qualities that comprise a human being. This may be giving the author too much credit. Perhaps he really is referring to souls in a literal sense. Who knows? <br />
<br />
Kirito calls these lights Fluctlights. The thing is, they don&#039;t seem to contribute anything substantial that would not already be conveyed by memories or other mental qualities. Every reference to Fluctlights could be replaced by words like &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
e.g. &quot;Artificial Fluctlight&quot; -&gt; &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot;<br />
<br />
It would get the relevant meaning across even without the imaginary technology. If your dialogue begins to sound like like an engineering booklet when a simple existing description would have sufficed, you are doing it wrong. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, it seems that one of the main points the show is getting at is the fact that people are who they are because of their memories. A fair point but one that has already been overused in speculative fiction. If you want to take that route, you need to beef up your analysis and related dialogue. <br />
<br />
Now, don&#039;t get me wrong. I can enjoy world-building, but you should not flood the viewer with arbitrary facts for the sake of itself. The details of the world should be constructed so that they support the underlying themes of the narrative. The world-building should actually pay off. For instance, do we need to spend several minutes on the origins of a legendary blade when it has nothing of substance to contribute? In comparison, when the show explains basic facts about their society, the information is actually quite a bit more helpful.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is not the worst of it though. It is not only about the sheer quantity of the exposition but the way in which it is told. There is a right way and a wrong way to provide this information. You should do it naturally, in a manner that actual people might use. <br />
<br />
Listen to this dialogue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who would&#039;ve thought that after [insert event here], we&#039;d actually [insert event here]? Sometimes I think I&#039;m dreaming.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on now. It&#039;s already been a year since [insert event here].&quot;<br />
<br />
How convenient. The characters are recapping the events out loud just when the audience needs the info. They go on for a while, listing various facts about their new pastimes and acquaintances. It is all screaming &quot;This is exposition!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirito comes across as a kind of Mr. Exposition sometimes, now more than ever. He is all about providing lists of random facts. He lists descriptions of things to the viewer without thinking deeply into their implications. And, incidentally, the other characters do very much the same, often even more so. Just listing facts all day, every day.<br />
<br />
All those lines could have been spent on other things. They could undergo some inner struggle every now and then. There might even be interesting moral conflict. Or how about examining their relationships with other people? But nope. While those other aspects receive some attention, they are usually pushed to the side in favor of further infodumps. Character interaction is really bogged down by this. If you have people acting as though they are reading straight out of an encyclopedia, they become difficult to relate to. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character backstories are sometimes treated in the same way. On one occasion, an important character is introduced by delivering an 8-minute flashback infodump on their backstory before ever meeting them. They have never even been mentioned before. You can probably see the problem here. Can&#039;t we at least wait until the character has been introduced normally?<br />
<br />
Also, the 8-minute flashback in question is narrated by another person throughout. Why? As I was saying, the flashback should wait, but if we must go forward with it, at least show it from the perspective of the relevant character. Show, don&#039;t tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Furthermore, too much time and effort is spent on fight scenes that ‒ while visually fine ‒ contribute little to the narrative and are resolved in a fairly arbitrary manner. <br />
<br />
When this is taking place, the dialogue also becomes very centered on explaining the flow of the battle and little else. One episode was almost entirely about swords. Swords clashing repeatedly with simple choreography (mostly people pushing their swords against each other), with the majority of the dialogue focused on swords, swordsmanship and all things related to the weapons in question. This is related to section 1) because much of this is yet another subset of unnecessary technobabble and infodumping.<br />
<br />
Now, if you are a diehard sword fan, this may be acceptable. (Or not if you don&#039;t like their portrayal of swordsmanship, and I can&#039;t really blame you.) But what if you are not into swords that much? I mean, the technical details. You&#039;ll have to sit through endless infodumping on the subject. Sure, the word &quot;sword&quot; is right there in the name of the franchise, but come on now. Twenty minutes of non-stop ranting about swords is a bit too much. You know, even fight scenes could be used for character development, moral struggle, etc., but that would take a different approach to dialogue and inner thoughts. Or at least try to be wittier about it. Don&#039;t just list the sword techniques in a bland manner.<br />
<br />
So what determines the winner of a sword fight? Finely tuned tactics? No, of course not. In this world, the best way to power up your sword is... strength of will. Yes. You can pretty much beat anyone if you infuse your sword with your imagination, emotion and various reasons to fight. Along with it, various names of sword styles will be mentioned, but they do not seem to affect the outcome in any consistent way, nor are they used tactically in any way that would generate interest. <br />
<br />
As a result, the battles easily devolve into showdowns of plot power. The winner is the one favored by the narrative. This is far from rare in shows that involve action scenes or various powerups, so this should not come as a surprise, but that does not mean that we should let it slide.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) And now for another fan favorite: over-the-top evil villains.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s another quote from Kirito:<br />
<br />
&quot;That attitude your father taught you, Tiese, in Eng... no, in sacred terms, it&#039;s called &#039;noble obligation.&#039; Nobles, that is, those with power must use it for the sake of the powerless. Let&#039;s see, you could also call it pride. And that pride is more important than any law or regulation. After all, there are things that you shouldn&#039;t do, even if it&#039;s not forbidden by law. And on the other hand, there might be things you should do, even if they are forbidden by law.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a bit better than what we would usually expect of Sword Art Online. It is also relevant to the premise and underlying themes. You see, this time the author has come up with an eerie medieval rural dystopia ruled by a dogmatic church. If this sounds familiar, you may have seen one in any number of JRPGs or fantasy in general. Which isn&#039;t necessarily a bad idea if done right. <br />
<br />
You could use this line of thought to demonstrate why dystopian dogmatic churches are, well, dystopian and dogmatic. There is also some shady manuevering going on in the real world. Maybe it could be applied to that.<br />
<br />
Well, at least in theory. Guess what kind of evil action Kirito is referring to? As is tradition in Sword Art Online, the evil action is... sexually harassing a girl.<br />
<br />
Yes. You heard it right. Out of all possible evil deeds out there, the author went with sexually harassing a girl. Again. Or rather beyond mere harassment and in an absurdly over-the-top way as well. If this sounds familiar, you must have been watching Sword Art Online because this keeps happening like clockwork. When the author wants to designate a character as evil or antagonistic, this is his go-to trope. The villains tend to commit sexual harassment or attempted rape, as if they wouldn&#039;t be evil enough otherwise. <br />
<br />
The author does this because he doesn&#039;t want the audience to have the slightest doubt over who is good and who evil here. So the villains just have to go for the same old sexual harassment or attempted rape. It would not have to be this way. There are other morally questionable things in the world, but nope. Can&#039;t write about those. Is the author legally obligated to write about sexual harassment and attempted rape, or does he not know that other topics exist?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So what is Alicization supposed to be?<br />
<br />
A straight-up heroic fantasy?<br />
A technobabble infodump? <br />
&quot;We are who we are because of our memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
...Is that really all? This is not enough. Instead of original or inspired, Alicization comes across as bland. Yes, there is a fantasy world out there, arguably fleshed out by the infodumps, but that isn&#039;t enough. You also need to do something interesting with the world. The narrative needs more substance.<br />
<br />
Remember when I quoted Kirito earlier on the superiority of thought over swords? He said so in the context of applying critical thought to law and morality. Fine. So give him a proper chance to think about it in detail and apply it in an interesting way. Instead, he (and sadly us, the viewers) are subjected to endless lists of arbitrary facts that are meaningless on their own. Or we get to witness action scenes which are resolved by plot power or used as platforms for even more infodumping.<br />
<br />
For all the talk about human souls, it is precisely what the narrative is lacking. Where is the humanity?

    For those of you who are unaware, SAO is the ISEKAI that brought the genre to immense popularity. While respecting that it is some what of a pioneer, the story tends to drag on unnecessarily and almost constantly views it&#039;s audience as unintelligent by walking everyone by the hand through plot points rather than allowing us to infer what is happening through context. It&#039;s SAO, so not watching doesn&#039;t make sense, but keeping it as a lower priority view  for this season is recommended. <br />
<br />
While the art is enjoyable and clean, they&#039;ve left out other potentially visceral aspects. The story and characters are nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294243">
        new, though aren&#039;t they expected to be, and the sound is underwhelming. Not pair the vivid enough visuals with similarly heavy sounds seems like some sort of crime. Episodes keep leaving potential on the table to the point that they cause annoyance. I can see more enthusiastic fans of the genre being irritated during viewing. Passive viewing is simply the most probable way to watch this series, which isn&#039;t that surprise, but is a little disappointing.

Covers as much ground as it can, but doesn&#039;t go in depth with anything it introduces. Lots of pointless content and irrelevant characters. Dreadful, pseudo-intellectual dialogue. Wine is often being drank when these conversations are had. Various things being shown from multiple different perspectives, or rather; realities. Hardly any plot advancement because showing a million different things is prioritized above all else. Good moments are scarce and typically enjoyable only because they suck so bad, but in most cases, the thing is just idiotic in a highly boring way and that&#039;s the end of this story. No, I didn&#039;t accidentally post my &#039;Legend of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295435">
        Galactic Heroes&#039; review under wrong entry, but am actually talking about Sword Art Online: Alicization. Show which I was supposed to watch ironically and laugh whenever anything happens, but the problem is that so often nothing happens.<br />
<br />
[Setup - Basically sums up episode 1]<br />
<br />
The story start off with wood chopping and sandwich making scenes. Fair enough, Kirito trains and the newest harem addition shows how she contains many essential &quot;ideal female&quot; characteristics, such as being able to make sandwiches and knowing how to read because she is smart. Well, I didn&#039;t laugh there, but the mary sue factors seemed quite potentially lol-worthy, and that was just the beginning so whatever, I watched more.<br />
<br />
So anyway, these three kids (they are kids now and there is 3 of them, and I still don&#039;t know who the third is, 2nd: Alice) go in this cave where some dragon used to dwell and they steal some ice from him Iunno what the fuck is happening, but they get lost and eventually end up in this place called dalukuu dellidoly (dark territory in English), and apparently crossing the border there is not simply illegal but super illegal. Just so happens to be this Alice girl is also showing how she is bit of a klutz -- which is another ideal female characteristics if someone doesn&#039;t know -- and falls down so her 3 finger tips cross the border and gets sentenced to death/is kidnapped. Lucky for them the 3rd kid awakens his Sharingan this very moment and not all hope is lost.<br />
<br />
After this we teleport back into season 2 of Sword Art Online (I guess) because Kirito is now an adult female or a man with ridiculously long hair in this one and there are lolies with guns and evil people wearing masks all around. This part was pretty fun because Kirito and his/hers buddies use light sabers and there is another dude here who has sharingan, I wonder who on earth he might be and how these things are relevant. This is me trying to connect the dots and at the same time my facial expression when watching it ._.<br />
<br />
At this point I had almost dropped the series. I was like &quot;holy shit, I swear this episode is at least 50 minutes long and never ends.&quot; but then I noticed it is actually a double episode and literally 50 minutes long. That didn&#039;t really help, tho, since I was only 20 minutes in.. but I wasn&#039;t technically wrong, so I continued.<br />
<br />
15 minutes later I came back to reality and realized I had been watching a scene where Kirito and harem have this really important conversation about some LED lights placed in the human soul or something, and lots of smart science stuff about some nerdy shit / someone trying to explain something regarding another thing, but it was basically about time functioning differently inside virtual reality, mind teleportation and finally confirmed this whole thing was actually inspired by Alice in Wonderland, which I had accidentally taken as a meme for years.... Neat. <br />
<br />
Well, at least this was followed with some cringe-ass confession scene which was concluded with a terribly animated kiss just to remind viewers that lots of deep love to be found here, after which some random dude attacks Kirito who then wakes up in the alternative kids world which seen in the beginning and is like &quot;oh yeah, this is the nerdy science shit virtual WORLD I just had a 15 minute dialogue about.&quot; How convenient, chaotically random and still didn&#039;t make me laugh because too boring, and more like offensively bad than lol-worthy. At least his body in real world paralyzed or something which is kinda cool and also happened in season 1, technically.. boy I wonder if he can ever turn back normal..<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
<br />
We have NPC&#039;s - just like in many/any other video games, and just like in many cyberpunk series: they are becoming self-aware, influenced by feelings and questioning their purpose in life. The vanity, the thought-provoking content and emotional depth create us a narrative that is about as fun to watch as it is intelligent. <br />
<br />
So far, the entire main plotline in this alternative world is practically incredibly slowly moving rescue arc that keeps on introducing new content and side tracks with episodic cliffhangers instead of trying to master or advance anything it already has going on. Pretty much half of the damn thing is slice of life or sol-like filler that serves no real purpose in the series, other than to make it more lengthy. And so far, the main plotline in the real world is basically also a slowly moving rescue arc that keeps on introducing new content and side tracks..... Well, I guess point delivered: some similarities exist among the plots. Great. <br />
<br />
In terms of directing or whatever we want to call it, scenes change with so little continuity and start playing out so randomly that it becomes highly noticeable: it stands out. This thing hasn&#039;t been build on very solid basis or structured in a passable manner. This level of story telling and directing would not be praised were this a new franchise. For example, even though the main storyline seems to be going nowhere, the series still has lots of content and is overall rather creating the illusion of fast pace and eventful story while really nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Perhaps my favorite part of the writing so far has been Alice&#039;s astral projection just teleporting inside Kirito&#039;s brain because I am not sure if that was actually foreshadowing regarding the nerdy technology shite or just her being used as a plot device to allow the story advance. By allowing it to advance, I don&#039;t mean it actually advanced because things like chopping trees are prioritized over such things. This is the part that offered at least some lulz.  The melodrama is also incredible because after Kirito was attacked he became some type of vegetable in the real world and lots of girls are real worried and crying. Such pathetic, try-hard shit-writing it&#039;s hard not to laugh when the thing is essentially worse written than average fanfiction. I just wish this was the main side of the story. Maybe later episodes will turn this thing into some sort of Sword Art Online 0, a story about depressed Asuna. #not_a_reference I dream. <br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
<br />
&#039;The Devil is a Part-Timer&#039;, anime from 2013, anyone? So this time around Kirito has a nice little side job, making Jesus a Part-Timer, too. Hah! Kirito is being Kirito here. The difference being that this time around he is not the most flawless being from day one, which is kinda cool I guess, especially when considering how the training side of this thing has been among the strongest parts of the series thus far. Still sucks, tho.<br />
<br />
His name is Eugeo! The third kid I mean. His role in the series is pretty much solely to tell Kirito some lore, fill him with information regarding the world and say out loud how impossible and things are and how amazing Kirito can be. Occasionally he also does some incredibly stupid decisions and fucks everything uppa. I am not going to spoil how badly, but I did laugh there. <br />
<br />
Alice&#039;s sister is pretty cute so I guess that&#039;s something + that carrying scene [by Kirito, naturally] was flawless in every way. She is especially good when considering most grills from this franchise were never even worth that much. Too bad she ain&#039;t a main character. As a whole, the cast surely isn&#039;t among reasons to follow this masterpiece, but it&#039;s still kinda worth it for the papa swag factor and council of neko-eared harem girls disgusting about issues. It&#039;s truly fascinating to see how 5 fanservice figures and Kirito&#039;s &quot;daughter&quot; have meetings and make plans. &quot;We totally matter and can do things.&quot; <br />
<br />
The more episodes there are, the more characters whose names I didn&#039;t even bother memorizing there are. That kind of amazing stuff going on here. I don&#039;t find mentioning anything about them to be worth of anyone&#039;s time, so I won&#039;t. Originally I planned also to write a section about the dialogue, but then I remembered I already said in the opening paragraph all that needs to be said about it. [Dreadful, pseudo-intellectual dialogue]. It also does amazing job making me not to like any characters because it is just that nauseating. <br />
<br />
[Production]<br />
<br />
Not the worst A-1 character design, but those CGI goblins are on another shitness level completely. The animation can be pretty rough and far from fluid. Cheap stuff, but also making me more confident that hiatus/split cours won&#039;t occur. The character movements are often awkward as well and again, CGI exists. From its color pallet and backdrops the thing also looks like other SAO series. The voice acting is meeting the same standards with earlier seasons as well. In terms of songs, big names in the making of OP and ED, as usual. BGM-wise, not much of it is present. Dialogue is the main thing that is being heard hear [fuck me, I know], occasionally some uber quiet &quot;menu music&quot; plays at the same time, or alternative terrible emotional song that convey feelings similarly as fart jokes deliver luls. Some based wobsie wob songs are present during action, but they surely could be better -- like everything else in the series... <br />
<br />
[Enjoyment]<br />
<br />
I am glad I didn&#039;t choose a career as a timberman. I am not entirely sure why I am still watching this. I rarely drop anime series these days, but this one is definitely getting closer and closer of getting onto that list.

    Sword Art Online franchise presents a new entry with its Alicization ark and doubles down on familiar writing disasters. With this season SAO reaches new storytelling lows and also seems to lose its last redeeming quality – action scenes. <br />
<br />
SCORE: 2 – Very Bad. <br />
<br />
STORY: Boring exposition scenes interrupted by obligatory and meaningless fights. <br />
At the beginning I was slightly confused, because SAO:A does not directly follow on its second season. This confusion lasted only a few episodes and worked as a setup for a new “death simulation” for Kirito, without his harem, but with the same amount of plot armor and OPnes. <br />
Terrible writing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304937">
        is more apparent in this season than anywhere else in the franchise. This show is too busy creating lengthy exposition dumps about either mundane or unnecessary topics: several episodes long discussion about calling and its meanings, that loses relevance after 1 sword swing; an entire episode to establish something as simple as basic royalty system; or 15 minutes of backstory for 2 characters, who lose within 10 seconds and vanish, just to name a few. As a result, plot progresses at a snail pace.<br />
<br />
Not that the actual plot is any good. A lot of techno gibberish, plot holes and questionable motivations. Just a simple “save the girl” premise buried under a convoluted mess of pointless subplots. <br />
<br />
At least, people will stop talking about Asuna’s horrible treatment in the first season, as SAO:A manages to top that scene. Genius. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: Kirito - doubled; harem - disabled. <br />
There is Kirito and then there is lesser Kirito, who is just a slightly inferior version of the original. Support cast consists of crazy dudes and girls, predetermined assault victims or characters who die for nothing. There is really not much to talk about here. <br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION: One step forwards, two steps backwards. <br />
While character models and backgrounds show more craftsmanship than the average anime show, SAO:A seems sterile und unimaginative, be it detailed but boring backgrounds or character designs. <br />
<br />
The biggest downgrade happened to action scenes. Sword fights turned into arm wrestling competition, where combatants just press glowing sticks against each other. Gone are the days of fluid sword dancing. Even the most potent fight against goblins in ep4 borrows too much from infamous directorial techniques like unnecessary camera movement or excessive close-ups, executed at 10 cuts per second. I certainly could not enjoy presented action.  <br />
<br />
SOUND: The most anime sound possible. <br />
This is a MVP production, as Minimal Viable Product. Neither the music, nor the voice act stand out and will leave any memory. Maybe with the exception of this distorted sound on high energy impacts during fights.   <br />
<br />
Do not waste your time on this garbage. If you are looking for a competent “trapped in a video game world” anime with a clear goal, superb world building, diplomacy, smart use of game mechanics and successful focus on NPCs, try Log Horizon.<br />

    Here we go, i saw a lot of negative comments about this series&#039; start.<br />
Of all seasons, I think Sword Art Alicization is one of the best series of sao, I didn&#039;t like the second part of the the first season (Fairy Dance) and all of the second season too much (the movie was cool though).<br />
Story 9/10 the story takes place in VR and take place just after the movie event (I don&#039;t want to write about the story cause i think i will spoiler something).<br />
Art 10/10 aniplex never makes mistakes. The art is very beautiful like the other sao.<br />
Sound 9/10 I think 9/10 because the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295505">
        ending song is not good as the opening but i believe the second ending will be cool like all the openings/endings of this series.<br />
Character 9/10 We see few new character as Eugeo,Alice, Ronye and Tiese don&#039;t worry we still have kirito,asuna,klein and the others.<br />
Enjoyment 10/10 I was wainting for the series,after I watched the movie I was a bit scared that it could be like the sao II but thanks to aniplex it wasn&#039;t ,Alicization is really good like the first part of the first season or even better.<br />
Overall 9.4/10 since i can choose only 9 or 10 i will give it a 10 cause after i watched 10 episodes I really like it and I&#039;m sure it will become better. <br />
<br />
Can&#039;t wait for the next episode.

    &quot;Watch Alicization, it&#039;s SO much better&quot;<br />
Because it is. Because normal people don&#039;t cling to their hate of a series and use everything it did wrong in the past as a reason to hate it in the present.<br />
Normal people won&#039;t go on about how &quot;SAO&#039;s biggest problem is itself,&quot; or try their damn hardest to try to prove how Reki fails as a writer because of what he&#039;s done in the past. They don&#039;t compare every little flaw in Alicization to what SAO was in the past because THIS ISN&#039;T THE PAST. Alicization isn&#039;t perfect, it has its flaws, but rating this series a 1, 3,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305449">
        hell even 5? No, Alicization is in almost every possible way lightyears ahead of the past seasons, and even the movie (which I enjoyed significantly more than either other season just fyi)<br />
<br />
Spoilers for any of the 3 people reading this who haven&#039;t already watched Alicization; of pretty much the entire thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boring infodumps&quot;<br />
Pretty much the biggest problem of Alicization as a whole. If it wasn&#039;t bad enough in ufotable&#039;s adaptation of UBW, Alicization is loaded to the brim with pausing in the middle of battles to make time seemingly stop in order to express dialogue that I can only imagine was a lot better in the original light novels.<br />
<br />
This was my biggest flaw with Alicization, yes. I won&#039;t deny that. But here&#039;s where I offer pushback as my reason for bringing this up first: THIS WASN&#039;T AN ISSUE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t understand what the issue is with so many people having problems with how Alicization decided to set the scene. It was a completely new setting in every way; the only relative similarity between it and past seasons of SAO is the fact that it&#039;s not a part of the real-world. Though, in a lot of ways, it might as well have been.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t me trying to tout moderate improvement to past seasons either, as something that&#039;s a little better than complete crap is still crap... this is more me saying that bad exposition turned into slightly above-average exposition. I had a lot of fun watching how Alicization started off and I got tons of great vibes from both the writer(s) and the general direction of how everything was handled. Kirito isn&#039;t just being thrown into this world nonsensically to kickstart a completely new story with the &quot;Sword Art Online&quot; branding that stars someone as famous as &quot;Kirito,&quot; this is the SAO world in a completely new light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time skips&quot;<br />
This is about one of the most laughable complaints I&#039;ve ever heard for any anime, hell any piece of media as far as I can remember. People really wanna try to compare the two-year time skip of Aincrad to the two-year time skip of Alicization. Alright, let me explain something very simple that&#039;s literally nothing more than basic understanding of the material you&#039;re writing about (ironically the people who don&#039;t have this probably shouldn&#039;t even be writing reviews in the first place) -<br />
<br />
Aincrad: Amidst a plethora of extremely interesting plot points, including (but not limited to) the overarching plot and setting, the introduction of cool characters, and the feeling of &quot;growing pains&quot; that surrounds all of these things, there was the decision to have an extended time skip pretty much RIGHT to the end. Aincrad&#039;s biggest issue is that it skipped past all the cool stuff that everyone would&#039;ve not only loved to see, but even NEEDED to see to be able to comprehend why everything that happened happened.<br />
<br />
Alicization: Amidst a plethora of extremely interesting plot points, almost all within the same parameters of Aincrad right before its infamous time skip, there was the decision to have an extended time skip right to the &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; part of the season. Alicization&#039;s biggest strongpoint is that it skipped past all the boring stuff that nobody would&#039;ve enjoyed seeing, essentially saving everyone a bunch of time by quickly filling in what would&#039;ve otherwise been a bunch of boring filler. God bless the team behind Alicization for not milking SAO out to be a generic battle shonen with 50+ straight episodes of filler, and instead cutting to the chase and saying &quot;ok, so this is what we did. And then we trained and grew for 2 years and now we&#039;re here. Now let&#039;s get to the good stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting it frankly, Aincrad skipped over the good stuff and Alicization skipped over the bad stuff. Remember, just because something is a horrible writing decision in one scenario doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s going to be just as bad in what is literally the EXACT OPPOSITE of the same scenario.<br />
<br />
&quot;It didn&#039;t have enough _____&quot;<br />
To fill in the blank, the most common terms other reviewers have used have been &quot;world-building,&quot; &quot;definition,&quot; &quot;focus,&quot; and other terms people have thrown around.<br />
<br />
To a certain point I can agree, but to the most basic of points I cannot.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with world-building. Common complaints you&#039;ll hear essentially say that &quot;because Alicization isn&#039;t an ACTUAL open-world MMO it fails at world building.&quot; Except... how many anime have you seen really nail world building to the level that it would be sufficient in an MMO scenario? It just doesn&#039;t happen, because anime is a different medium to an actual MMO. Even top-tier world building, like what you&#039;d find in something like FMAB, wouldn&#039;t compare to an actual lore-rich MMO.<br />
<br />
Kirito, Eugeo, and Alice grow up in one town, and the main goal of that town is specifically the tree Eugeo has to cut down. So why exactly does every little village need to be covered? Then they move onto a more upper-class city because they&#039;re trying to become nobles. So why does everything need to be covered there? And then they move onto the cathedral, where it&#039;s made very clear that they only fight against knights on very specific floors. So why does every floor need to be covered?<br />
<br />
A lot of people think that because an anime is based inside of what is otherwise an MMORPG that it needs to have the same caliber of world-building as one. However, this isn&#039;t World of Warcraft. This is SAO, an anime series. And personally, I think the quicker that you begin to realize that, the more you&#039;ll end up enjoying Alicization as a whole.<br />
<br />
This is a 24-episode anime series, so not every single town, camp, NPC, and even table can have the same huge backstory that those respective things would in an actual MMORPG. Of course this isn&#039;t me saying the world-building of Alicization is absolutely amazing either, I&#039;m just saying it does its job. Not every anime needs to have world-building as good as FMAB to be sufficient.<br />
<br />
Now for definition. I don&#039;t have a lot to say about this because I actually agree with people saying Alicization isn&#039;t extremely well-defined. Personally, I think it does its job well, but it definitely isn&#039;t perfect, hell I&#039;d probably not even say its good; just a bit above average, really.<br />
<br />
The main issue Alicization has with its overall definition and polish is the simple fact that it will fall really flat in being overly cohesive as an anime. It tells a lot more than it shows sometimes, which is something I will forever consider a flaw in a visual medium. But as I said, I don&#039;t have a ton to say because I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as good as the fanboys say or as bad as the haters say. It&#039;s average, maybe just a bit above it.<br />
<br />
But man, focus. This is where I have a bone to pick with certain individuals.<br />
<br />
I will agree fully with the fact that certain things DID deserve more focus than they got, particularly around Eugeo&#039;s backstory and the fact that a lot of things went completely ignored. It really does bother me that the issues he (apparently) had with his family went completely ignored, and how he suddenly remembered that it wasn&#039;t just him and Alice together as children, but Kirito as well... except, he just conveniently forgot what happened during the 6 years that they weren&#039;t together (between when Alice disappeared and when Kirito spawned back into the underworld at his real-world age). I wanna know more about this kind of stuff, and the fact that these things weren&#039;t really covered does bother me quite a bit, and definitely worked towards impacting the story in a negative way.<br />
<br />
But, just because the story had a few glaring issues suddenly means that EVERYTHING it did was wrong? No way.<br />
<br />
See, even though I said earlier that Alicization isn&#039;t an MMO, there&#039;s still the blatant fact that it&#039;s definitely ABOUT an MMO. Of course something about an MMO that takes place in an MMO is going to have MMO characteristics, just like how it DID have an overarching world and the world was built around the plot despite not being built to the level you&#039;d expect from a traditional MMO. To say that Alicization lost focus by putting too much attention on &quot;unimportant matters&quot; is just foolish.<br />
<br />
Fluctlights are important. As are sword skills, and how they happen. As is the villain and what they&#039;re gonna do, the same way you would talk about taking on a boss in an MMO. Remember, this isn&#039;t just purely a simulation/video game, but that it also isn&#039;t JUST a battle of humanity challenging a greater evil. It&#039;s both.<br />
<br />
Before I start rambling, let&#039;s wrap up this &quot;reviewer rant&quot; section with a few other points before getting into MY review.<br />
<br />
1. Alicization intentionally doesn&#039;t always take itself seriously. Much like many fans of comedy (both in and out of anime) understand very clearly, even the most serious things can have comedic breaks without seeming out of character. Alicization does the same thing except with both comedy and absurdity. It likes to be fun, and if it doesn&#039;t always take itself too seriously, you shouldn&#039;t either. Just have fun, you&#039;ll enjoy it a lot more.<br />
<br />
2. The actual content of the plot is different from past seasons of SAO solely because things have a reason for happening. Nitpicking every little issue from the plot doesn&#039;t necessarily take away the real substance of it and what makes it great, which is something I don&#039;t see enough reviewers talking about (and it honestly bothers the hell out of me). They talk about the flaws in a way that creates a two-page wall of text, and then end it with &quot;and this is why it sucks.&quot; That&#039;s only part of it, though; be fair and respectful towards the creators and talk about BOTH parts.<br />
<br />
3. I&#039;ll go deeper into this later, but I want people to understand that the &quot;casuals will be casuals&quot; argument is about the dumbest thing any person can genuinely use against Alicization.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for my own words that aren&#039;t at all intended to be used directly against anyone else&#039;s.<br />
<br />
What was the main grabber that made me realize that the general story of Alicization was different from past seasons of SAO? If I had to pin down one exact thing, it would be everything that happens happens for a well-defined reason.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t just the time skip, insane plot armor (Jesus-kun), and nonsensical BS that ruined Aincrad (and the entire first and most of the second season as a whole). What it was was that even an outstanding majority of the sections that were complete and coherent had no real reason to be happening.<br />
<br />
Kirito meets a girl and she dies. Waste of an episode. Three episodes of watching him and the female lead screw around. Waste of three episodes. Cut away to a period of time where they spent 3 episodes getting a sword to make Kirito even more overpowered and then some random girl is sick and we&#039;re supposed to care about her. Waste of literally half a season.<br />
<br />
Alicization not only improves on this array of crap, but handles it in ways that aren&#039;t hard to get attached to.<br />
<br />
As opposed to introducing an interesting character and immediately forgetting about them for the rest of the series, Alicization introduces multiple interesting characters that fully fulfill their role in the series. When something happens, it makes sense why it happens and it&#039;s typically very enjoyable. The long-term static growth of these characters often happens off-screen, but the main kicker is the fact that when there&#039;s a significant amount of growth in a short amount of time, we see it and are able to understand fully why it&#039;s happening, and it always makes sense.<br />
<br />
The time that&#039;s wasted in Alicization isn&#039;t wasted with events that make no sense, because everything makes sense and there&#039;s always a good reason for it. The issues each character faced were clearly cut out and made sense, and were enjoyable to watch, even if some of them ended up being dumb, mindless fun without much real substance.<br />
<br />
Even with the controversial way of handling a topic as sensitive as sexual abuse, there was never a time where it felt overly edgy or at all like fetishizing the subject, instead the themes were mature and the audience was respected throughout the exploration of the subject.<br />
<br />
Alicization doesn&#039;t do a lot to question the way people think or how you do things; it isn&#039;t psychological or philosophical. Instead, you have this action series that handles itself like an action series, staying true to itself throughout the entire thing, start to finish, doing everything in a way that makes sense and is enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
If my discussion of the story sounded at all basic, open-ended in a bad way, or generally stretched out without much substance, that&#039;s because it was. The story of Alicization was the worst part of it, it was a pretty good story that wasn&#039;t great, and most of the reason I liked it came down to personal enjoyment of action anime and the fact that it was coherent enough to get by. As I mentioned earlier, not everything NEEDS to be taken super seriously, and it&#039;s a lot easier to enjoy things that aren&#039;t perfect (or in this case, great) when you decide to just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.<br />
<br />
That isn&#039;t to say that the story of Alicization was bad, though. Just not amazing. Still pretty good. Flawed. Not perfect, but definitely above-average.<br />
<br />
But the characters... this was definitely the biggest improvement to past seasons of SAO.<br />
<br />
Alicization completely obliterates every past season of SAO in the character department for 3 main reasons:<br />
<br />
1. General character layout<br />
2. Number of characters<br />
3. Purpose of characters<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s dive deeper.<br />
<br />
What I mean by &quot;general character layout&quot; is the fact that Kirito, beyond the first episode, understands fully well that he&#039;s in a virtual world and that none of these people are real. This is a huge deal because of how characters have been handled in past seasons; Kirito understood that all the people in SAO, ALO, and GGO were real, living human beings.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s different, but why is it important? Fantastic question. Because it allows Kirito to question the decisions he makes.<br />
Aside from how the season ends, the idea that sits in the back of Kirito&#039;s brain throughout the entire season is that the world is virtual and nothing huge is lost if he doesn&#039;t complete his mission. Despite that, he still draws huge ties to the individuals he meets and fights as hard as he possibly can to ensure that the mission is eventually completed.<br />
I consider this extremely important for one reason: Kirito was once the most basic anime protagonist to ever exist. Now, he has layers and it&#039;s a lot easier to relate to him on a personal level, beyond that of a basic &quot;haha I like video games too Kirito is a cool anime character.&quot; Hell, there may even be times where you&#039;ll forget that this is the same Kirito from the last two seasons; god knows I felt that way a few times.<br />
<br />
Number of characters is a lot more important than many will realize; there really isn&#039;t an actual &quot;wasted&quot; character here.<br />
If you learn as little as the name of any character, you&#039;ll be quick to understand that they&#039;re probably gonna be important to the plot, and 100% of the time that ends up being the case. This contradicts from past seasons of SAO purely because you had characters like Klein, Liz, Silica, Suguha, and Agil that had no actual meaning to the plot... and if you&#039;re like me, you understand that that was a MAJORITY of the &quot;primary&quot; characters in the first 2 seasons.<br />
<br />
Alicization takes a different, FAR superior approach, to the characters; everybody means something to the plot, and the ones who don&#039;t are just simply left as non-characters who aren&#039;t even properly introduced. A lot of ways this is proven are by things like characters being introduced early-on and having an important role later on, characters being or not being introduced by name quickly after their first on-screen appearance, or characters doing something for the plot early on. The amount of organization that comes from something as simple as NOT creating a character unless they have a reason to exist increases the overall quality of the season significantly.<br />
<br />
The purpose of characters is quite possibly the most important thing here, but the thing that requires the least explaining just because of how obvious it is and how much better it makes things.<br />
<br />
Let me give you a quick example. Sinon was a female lead many considered badass because she wasn&#039;t a Mary Sue like Asuna, and actually had some definition and substance whereas Asuna didn&#039;t. The problem was, despite Sinon&#039;s positive attributes, she still became part of Kirito&#039;s harem.<br />
Alice is similar; she&#039;s by far the best female lead in SAO history (even if she is basically just a thought until halfway through the season), and has tons of definition even compared to Sinon. But... she doesn&#039;t become part of Kirito&#039;s harem, instead she remains mostly independent in personality and thought.<br />
<br />
This didn&#039;t just apply to Alice, either. Eugeo wasn&#039;t Klein; a quick sidekick abandoned after two epiodes. His existence was just as important as Kirito&#039;s, something that couldn&#039;t be said about any other character in either of the past seasons besides Asuna&#039;s in Mother&#039;s Rosario.<br />
Selka didn&#039;t just sit as lolibait to make people feel like they had their own &quot;imouto-chan&quot; to love and cherish, she actually sat as positive progression of Alice&#039;s character later on. Complete 180 compared to Suguha.<br />
Ronie and Tiese weren&#039;t just random waifus to add to Kirito&#039;s harem like Silica and Liz, they were essential parts to progressing the story of Kirito and Eugeo, essentially the reason their journey of saving Alice truly began in the first place.<br />
Etc, etc.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s really hard to ignore how in SO many ways Alicization just takes the parts that made past seasons of SAO complete crap and makes them great. This isn&#039;t just polishing a turd, this is completely restructuring the turd and turning it into pure gold. Again, more reviewers need to talk about this kind of stuff.<br />
<br />
This is something I can brush over quickly, before wrapping everything up: the art and sound of Alicization was near perfection.<br />
<br />
While you will get the ufotable UBW vibes of &quot;let&#039;s slow down/pause the battle to add in dialogue&quot; pretty often throughout Alicization, what you&#039;ll also get is the artistic fidelity of ufotable UBW, or at least damn close. The art is beautiful; the still scenes are absolutely gorgeous, the environments are a treat to look at, and the quality of the battles are nothing I&#039;d consider any less than majestic. The art and animation of Alicization are not up for debate; they&#039;re amazing.<br />
<br />
The sound does the same thing, just to me perhaps a little better. As a die-hard Yuki Kajiura fanboy, it&#039;s quite easy for me to enjoy every little detail of the music here, to the point where even tracks that I felt like I&#039;d heard too much in the prior 2 seasons felt really great (and slightly nostalgic) when mixed into Alicization; if anything, they felt a lot more at-home here than in the past. Of course, all of the new music was incredible down to the finest detail as well, including both opening/ending themes. And like with all Japanese dubs, the voice acting was also nothing less than superb.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s wrap everything up into a nice little package.<br />
<br />
Haters gonna hate, and I don&#039;t say that in a preppy teenager way either. I mean it.<br />
If every reference to SAO were pulled from Alicization and it were otherwise the exact same thing rebranded into something new, the top 3 reviews wouldn&#039;t be negative and the series would absolutely, no question about it, sit a lot closer to an 8.2-8.3 in overall average rating.<br />
<br />
This is SAO, and with how bad the first two seasons were (ESPECIALLY the first), people can&#039;t handle SAO being good for once. Because of that single bias against something that&#039;s nothing more than a label, the haters will drag every little flaw it has through the dirt until they can make it look so bad that nobody will even be willing to talk about the plethora of things it does insanely well.<br />
<br />
This is not a crappy season that only casuals praise. Far from it. Anyone saying, thinking, or believing that &quot;casuals will be casuals&quot; and that &quot;watch Alicization, it&#039;s SO much better&quot; is the battle cry of casuals in denial are just foolish. The casuals that made SAO as popular as it is in the first place only existed initially, and since its first year or so of post-airing existence, the series has been considerably dragged through the dirt more and more to the point where there&#039;s so few new SAO fans appearing out of thin air these days. The casuals who made the series popular literally 5-6 years ago went from being edgy middle schoolers to now being working, bill-paying adults who likely wouldn&#039;t praise the series &quot;just because it&#039;s SAO.&quot; These are individuals with taste who likely dislike the first two seasons of SAO just as much as you, and only praise Alicization BECAUSE IT&#039;S ACTUALLY GOOD.<br />
<br />
And really, in the end, that&#039;s what it all comes down to. People praise Alicization because it&#039;s good. They praise it because it does things right. They praise it because instead of the abundance of meaningless &quot;primary&quot; characters, there&#039;s significantly less characters and all of them have meaning. They praise it because the bland, 2D cardboard cutout protagonist is no longer Jesus-kun, and is now fully a respectable protagonist somewhat worthy of his popularity (though as a whole still quite overrated). They praise it because sometimes you&#039;ll even forget Kirito is the same protagonist of the prior 2 crap seasons, just because he&#039;s that much different, and when you ARE reminded that he&#039;s the same person, it&#039;s for a good reason; he flaunts his unique duel-wielding style or he starts wearing his Aincrad clothing without being absurdly overpowered.<br />
<br />
Alicization has flaws, but they&#039;re not the crazy things that so many people consider comparable to the flaws of the first two seasons. Instead, Alicization fixes most of them by creating its own thing that ends up being great due to careful planning and quality writing.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m excited for season 2, and for once in my life, I&#039;m starting to think I may have an overall positive view of SAO. Thanks for reading and have a great day!

    So I decided to torture myself by watching another season of SAO, after being so disappointed that i dropped the second season halfway in (the end of the GGO arc), but I&#039;m glad to say that this season exceeded my expectations.<br />
The story has improved significantly and has an added element of mystery that is actually compelling. My only complaints being that there is quite a bit of exposition that could be done in a more interesting way and the second one being a bit with the direction that there may be occasions where the imagery may be slightly unrelated to the dialogue and a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294592">
        of visual focus may fall on insignificant details, but it&#039;s much better than in the previous seasons (that&#039;s me nitpicking a bit, but that&#039;s usually kinda what separates masterpieces from other works).<br />
The artwork is great, the artstyle is nice and polished and the occasional use of cgi only adds to the visual effects and it&#039;s used smartly to add more tension to fight scenes and overcome the limitations of 2D animation.<br />
Another thing I&#039;m happy that Kirito&#039;s character stopped being the center of the universe and has stepped back a bit (SPOILER ALERT) has taken a bit the role of a mentor and a guiding figure(END OF SPOILER). Overall his character has much more dimension showing that the writing has improved. THE KIRITO FANCLUB has finally more personality beyond just &quot;OH MY GOD KIRITO IS SO COOL!!!1!&quot; and it&#039;s established in just a few scenes.<br />
Also praise whoever decided to tone down the fanservice to just 1 second of an awkward position in 1 episode out of 4.<br />
So far I&#039;m really enjoying it and i really hope it doesn&#039;t go downhill from here, cause it&#039;s going in a good direction

    As someone who is coming in attached to Sword Art Online because of the Aincrad Arc, who was let down by the Fairy Tale Arc, who felt GGO and the rest of SAO II was satisfactory, Alicization has done nothing but exceed my expectations. From the start, the world that was created around Kirito, Eugeo, and Alice was one that had me mesmerized. This was the world building that I saw glimpses of in the Aincrad arc, that I wish I had seen more of. From the details of the cove, to how the town looked, I was instantly drawn to this world. Although it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295599">
        might have seemed kind of filler to individuals, the second half of the first episode, I can assure you, is integral to much later on in the story. Additionally, I understand that many people had problems with the cut-down time lapse of Kirito and Eugeo making their way to the capital, but honestly, plot-wise, this was easily the best choice for them to cut down budget wise. Additionally, say what you will, I believe that Episode 10 was built up to incredibly well from the previous episodes. The two minor antagonists, were essentially built around the character development of the world itself; they were individuals who used the Taboo Index to their advantage in order to carry out their ill desires, their human desires. I believe that the scene (I won&#039;t explain in detail) was extremely graphic, but in a way that was critical to the plot unlike Sugou and the Fairy Tale arc. I believe that the producers did an amazing job in truly building up the suspense and violence in such a scene, and that this scene was critical in furthering the plot development regarding Fluctlight behaviour. I would say that scene was more powerful than anything I&#039;ve watched previously, and as someone who&#039;s seen shows like Goblin Slayer, trust me, this scene is messed up. Nonetheless, I believe it was executed extremely well by the show producers, and I can only look forward to see what&#039;s coming in store. Additionally, I believe the art animation, although choppy in some areas, is that fantasy vibe that captures Alicization well. You want the epic sword fights that you signed up for from the Aincrad arc? You&#039;ll get plenty of it. You want to hear the best soundtracks from the previous seasons come out remade, with a whole added kick? Done. You want to see Kirito start anew in a world where he isn&#039;t totally broken, and has to actually learn how to use the system and develop like a normal protagonist would? It&#039;s done. Sick of harem and fanservice? It&#039;s cut down immensely in this season. You want actual side characters that are constantly developed and not just shadows in the background? Eugeo, and later Alice are clear cut examples of that. Paying attention to every detail in the show rewards the viewer well, and it&#039;ll only continue to do so in the future episodes. I&#039;m excited to see what the best arc of Sword Art Online has to bring, and I believe that this arc has redeemed the series from what has been an abysmal past season. If you liked the Aincrad Arc, and put up with everything after, you&#039;ll be rewarded for your loyalty to this series with Alicization. A 52 episode season isn&#039;t something that we get often in this day and age, and from the looks of the first 10 episodes, I can&#039;t help but get excited for the episodes to come.

    As a TL;DR, if you absolutely hate SAO, you&#039;re still probably going to hate this. Its improved but still has some of it&#039;s issues.<br />
<br />
If you think parts of SAO were good and others (*cough* ALO) were bad, this season is as good or better than the Aincrad arc. <br />
<br />
The story and premise for this season were overall very interesting and helped build an incredibly interesting situation. I have a few issues with the story (mainly the IRL portion), but overall its 8/10, pretty good. As a light novel reader, I understand the anime had to gloss over some things, but overall I think they are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295853">
        keeping a good balance of plot development and speed. <br />
<br />
The art, sound, and animation are 10/10 as always with A1 Pictures. This anime is beautiful and well made. <br />
<br />
Now as to why this particular season is arguably the strongest in SAO. Simply put, it has a lot more content and many characters that even Kirito has to respect. Things are darker, there&#039;s blood and gore. There&#039;s also many characters that are incredibly influential. As always, characters are rather static but some of them do change and grow; they&#039;re important. <br />
<br />
That can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. This arc is based off of roughly 10 light novels as opposed to the usual 2. Not every single episode is filled to the brim with action; there&#039;s dialogue and character development.  Rest assured though, there are plenty of epic fights in this show, especially in the upcoming episodes. People will complain that its too fast or too slow, just know that it has a lot to cover and that there are fast and slow parts. <br />
<br />
Overall, As a LN reader so far I&#039;m loving this season. There&#039;s plenty or things to look forward to and what&#039;s already there is very well executed. If you absolutely hate SAO this probably won&#039;t change your mind, but its a good story with fun to watch fights and a plot that explores what its like to be human; definitely an improvement from previous arcs. I&#039;m slightly biased as this is the only series I can stand reading ahead, but I highly suggest you watch this.

    This season of Sao so far is on par with the first half of the first season and its fix problem that people have with the previous season such as lacking world-building(I heard from the light reader that the world building is present in some arc).My complaint so far for this season is that the studio who are adapting this arc didn&#039;t include some character monologue such as Asuna, and it was her who solve where Kirito is in book 10. I really hate how the studio included anime-original scene during episode 5-6 subplot where they have every girl in kirito harem there having a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297825">
        discussion about Rath project and Kirito condition. So far, this season is better than alt-ggo.<br />
<br />
pro:world-building and addition of 2 news character name Alice and Eugeo<br />
Con: Didn&#039;t  give Asuna(best girl) justice in episode 5-6 subplot. When comparing her from the book material to the anime, Asuna from the book is way better than her counterpart in the anime.<br />
<br />
Light novel Asuna&gt; Anime Asuna<br />
<br />
Idk why, but the art is kinda throwing me off than the ordinal scale movie<br />
<br />
I recommended you to go to the Gamerturk youtube channel on youtube who do very well to explain  where the anime didn&#039;t include.

    LISTEN, MAYBE IT&#039;S AN UNPOPULAR OPINION, BUT THIS SEASON IS THE BEST SEASON OF SAO TO DATE.<br />
<br />
I get it, people don&#039;t like it, but I&#039;m gonna take a minute to explain why I loved it oh so much. Number one: the sound design and art are absolutely gorgeous. I think the storyline for this season gave a lot of opportunity for beautiful art, and this season didn&#039;t disappoint. I think I have a thing with lighting effects because every time I see an anime with stunning lighting, I have to bring it up. See: SAO. The sound, also, especially during the last half of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304972">
        season, was so lovely and emotional.<br />
<br />
The story. Okay, so I&#039;m assuming this where everyone&#039;s hang-ups lie, right? Let me tell you why you may not like this season: it isn&#039;t all about Kirito and Asuna anymore. In fact, the main clique from SAO doesn&#039;t show up much in this season. It&#039;s VERY different compared to the seasons prior. <br />
<br />
That, however, is why I loved it. I felt like SAO needed a revamp after the second season, and I think this season proved to me how much better the series could be. The story itself was imminently intriguing. The world that was created for Alice and Eugeo (the world Kirito finds himself in this season) is something that I fell for immediately; in fact, I&#039;d love to see an entire anime just about those three in that world rather than just a season. To me, at least, the story change was very well written because the dynamic it reigned in was something completely unlike anything we&#039;ve seen before. There is a bit of a time jump in the middle that&#039;s a bit weird, but for the most part, the pacing is done really well to explain how these characters get from point A to point B. It doesn&#039;t feel like anything&#039;s missing. <br />
<br />
If you wanna know the main reason I fell in love with this season, though (even though the story was fresh and interesting), it was the characters. The new additions to the cast made this season for me. Especially Eugeo. Because this world is so different, Eugeo came off as a very unique character, and I liked that. The development he went through was some of the most interesting I&#039;ve seen because of how it was written. You got to see all colors, and that&#039;s something I was surprised to see given the fact that he isn&#039;t a main member of the overall SAO cast. He become beloved very quickly.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, though, I think getting to see Kirito connect this much with someone new (Eugeo) was really valuable for the series. I&#039;m glad that that was written in and shown because it offered some movement and development for Kirito as a character that we haven&#039;t gotten in a long time. The previous seasons ended up flat-lining because it felt like repeated material after a while, so that&#039;s why I think this season is so special; it shook everything up. It made me get invested in SAO again. Even the parts that don&#039;t involved Eugeo and Alice. <br />
<br />
The thing I think I&#039;m most excited for going forward is seeing how this has changed Kirito and what all of this means in the real world. Also if anything will connect together in the future. I don&#039;t feel like I did a whole lot of explaining during this review, but I will say this: Sword Art Online: Alicization is one of the best things I&#039;ve seen in anime.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br />
<br />
I wrote SAO review about my opinions on series and opinions of those who disliked it or hated it. Now i&#039;ll write more opinion on series and Alicization. Before i could review Alicization arc,i have to get this off my chest.<br />
<br />
Sword Art Online anime series do have problems that some part of audience can&#039;t overlook and made them dislike it or hate it,but problems that SAO have are not THAT bad! I have watched the worst anime such as Mars Of Destruction,Pupa,Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven and Wounded Man (Kizuoibito) so i could tell you how to recognize a REAL bad anime and that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305014">
        problems that SAO have are not a big deal in worst anime i watched. SAO anime series does not have same problems that Mars Of Destruction,Pupa,Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven and Wounded Man have! They are not on same level either! I can&#039;t spoil them so now that i gotten that off my chest,let&#039;s talk about Alicization anime now.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with story first. SAO anime series along with Alicization DO have story that is not well written,but it&#039;s not horrible either. Alicization&#039;s plot have decent writing and interesting dialogues which makes this anime enjoyable,but problems that it&#039;s have is not big deal and it&#039;s have problems that can be overlooked. 6/10 because i don&#039;t care about anime plots and i have nothing to say about story.<br />
<br />
Art and animation in Alicization is great. I loved how fight scenes and other great scenes in anime are animated,especially the fight scene between Kirito and Quinella. Also,weapon and character&#039;s art are great as well,i liked Kirito&#039;s new black sword (Night Sky Sword),Eugeo&#039;s Blue Rose Sword and Alice&#039;s golden Fragrant Olive Sword artworks are designed. Character&#039;s art design of Alice i loved the most,she is beautiful like Asuna. 10/10 for great art and animation<br />
<br />
Music,soundtrack and voice acting is great and flawless. I love both opening songs,which are great for my ears and lyrics is great as well,but they cannot beat Crossing Field,one of my favorite anime songs of all times. Ending songs are great too,i loved forget-me-not,it&#039;s melody,lyrics and vocals,it&#039;s like Aimer and YUI (one who sang Again,opening song for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) combined together. Forget-me-not is in same level as Shirushi and Yume Sekai,very addicting and great songs. Soundtrack in Alicization is music to my ears and voice acting is great as well. I liked how my favorite voice actresses like Haruka Tomatsu and Ai Kayano voiced the Asuna and Alice flawlessly with spirit and Kirito&#039;s voice actor done a great job with Kirito&#039;s lines. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka is very good at giving voice to characters that have warrior&#039;s spirit and confidence. 10/10 for that.<br />
<br />
Now here we are with characters... Oh,boy,all that hatred towards my favorite characters... Especially mai waifus... -_-<br />
<br />
Regarding Kirito,he is not a bad protagonist. Generic looks for which i don&#039;t care about aside,for those who said he got no personality: &#039;No personality&#039; is not right word to describe the characters who are not lacking any kind of emotions and who are not Kuudere. Just because his personality changed every time because SAO turned into death game,lost people who cared about such as Sachi,helping players in trouble,fallen in love with Asuna and all other things that happened in SAO anime series and Alicization or because his personality is lacking some certain characteristics or features you expected does not mean he have &#039;no personality&#039;. He just acts like a normal human being would. Any normal human being would act calm and collected,emotional and hot-headed in battles,depending on person&#039;s nature. Personalities of male protagonists are not easy to write or describe. Kirito&#039;s personality is not written well,but it&#039;s not horrible. It&#039;s have pros and cons and i don&#039;t see anything wrong with him behaving like that.<br />
<br />
Now about Kirito being OP... OP or overpowered characters can be good characters in many ways,but their powers can be unbalanced if character or their power is not well written or because character lacks something that makes his OP nature enjoyable. Kirito is very powerful,but not OP. To be OP,he must be completely invincible like Saitama (One Punch Man) or Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) or any unbeatable OP character. Kirito have weaknesses and almost died many times and also he was defeated 4 times. (once in Fairy Dance arc fighting NPC guardians,twice against Yuuki in a duels and once to protect Asuna,Yuuki and Sleeping Knights so they could defeat a boss) That is not only reason why Kirito&#039;s powers are balanced,he also have motivation to use his powers,internal struggles and faced many difficult challenges and conflicts. (also he lost his arm in Alicization) He is not mere &#039;power fantasy&#039; OP character and also,his powers are unique. Some of people don&#039;t like when some protagonists always win,but anime is not about winning or losing! How would plot progressed if Kirito wasn&#039;t powerful? He is smart and great swordsman,which makes him worthy opponent. Overall,he is decent protagonist with balanced powers and mixed personality and traits that make him fun and enjoyable character.<br />
<br />
Now for main characters,antagonists and supporting characters. Asuna is cute and beautiful,as usual. Same for other female characters from previous seasons. <br />
<br />
As for Alice,she got a great figure,many cute traits and she is beautiful. Such a beautiful blue eyes,golden hair... Also she can cook like Asuna and she got a cute personality at the time when Kirito and Alice were climbing at tower :) Great waifu material,i gotta say,even thought she became Integrity Knight with some of her memories and emotions weakened. Alice&#039;s role is written very well,i gotta say. <br />
<br />
As for Eugeo,a village boy who is Kirito&#039;s best friend,he is good character. I like how he grows up by learning Kirito&#039;s sword style and his speeches,which is good to see character who grows up and having very important at this arc. Even though he is weak person,but his heart and swordsmanship and determined personality is strong enough to sacrifice himself to defeat Sword Golem. <br />
<br />
As for supporting characters,i don&#039;t really care that much about them so i have nothing to say about them.<br />
<br />
Here we are now talking about antagonists in Alicization who i hate the most.<br />
<br />
First,corrupted noblemen who tried to rape two girls who were Kirito&#039;s and Eugeo&#039;s disciples,Ronnie and Tiese,i hated them sooo much.<br />
Second,that Chudelkin is real ugly mother*****r,i hate him sooo much.<br />
And finally,Quinella or Administrator,she is despicable like Oberon. Not only she got a God complex,but unlike Oberon,who planned to mind control 300 players he trapped,Quinella is power hungry evil ruler who treats her people as a food for Sword Golems and steals a memories to mind control some people giving them fake &#039;love&#039; and stuff and making them Integrity Knights. I hate her so much in same way i hate Oberon and Prime Minister. (Akame Ga Kill) 9.5/10 for characters (antagonists not included)<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I really,really loved and enjoyed it to fullest. I loved the fight scenes,my favorite is one in last episode where Kirito defeats Quinella with Vorpal Strike with a badass way. And that opening and ending songs were sooo amazing that i put then on my phone. Alicization,just like the movie and previous seasons,were very fun to watch and very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall:10/10<br />
Alicization was a masterpiece! I loved almost everything on it. I know that anime series have flaws that ruined someone&#039;s enjoyment,but flaws in anime series are not bad enough to ruin huge success it&#039;s gotten.<br />
<br />
Why some people who dislike or hate flaws that are not a big deal?<br />
Because some flaws that are not fatal or can be overlooked are too much for some part of audience who were high at expectations or have different tastes and standards. They focus too much on problems rather than thinking of good points and hidden gems.<br />
<br />
Sword Art Online anime series have huge commercial success and look at stats at MAL,so many people gave 10/10&#039;s,9/10&#039;s,8/10&#039;s and 7/10&#039;s. That means that majority liked or loved them. <br />
<br />
What kind of &#039;bad&#039; protagonist is number 13 and have 32,839 favorites in MAL?<br />
<br />
What kind of &#039;bad&#039; waifu is number 37 and 20,164 favorites in MAL?<br />
<br />
What kind of &#039;bad&#039; anime gets this huge success? <br />
<br />
What kind of &#039;bad&#039; light novels sold 22 million copies worldwide? <br />
<br />
What kind of &#039;bad&#039; anime movie gets 38.2 million dollars at box office? <br />
<br />
From merchandise to video games such as Hollow Fragment,Lost Song,Hollow Realization,Accel World vs SAO and Fatal Bullet,those are proof of SAO&#039;s success and popularity. <br />
If anime and light novels were THAT bad,it&#039;s would not get such a huge commercial success and popularity,fan base,merchandise and video games and i would not talk about it here. If anime series are successful and if majority loved it or liked it,then they are objectively good anime series.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope for next season be great as this anime. Link Start!<br />

    I&#039;m really sad that people give it a bad review because of the other seasons. This one is entirely different and better.<br />
<br />
Alicization is clearly the best anime of 2018. The plot is good and you always want the next episode to know the rest. The characters are well written and they may be OP, but it doesn&#039;t matter. The story isn&#039;t filled by fights but when there&#039;s one, it still is good.<br />
<br />
The music is amazing, nothing else to say about that.<br />
<br />
THE DRAWINGS ARE AWESOME !!! I really liked SNK for the drawings and SAO managed to do even better than them.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295875">
        more than any other. I hope it will last more than just one season.<br />
<br />
(I&#039;m sorry if there are some errors with my english)

    so i decided to watch s3 after i watched the movie which i liked...s2 was a disaster and i thought that i never would watch any other sao related movies or series BUT i watched the movie and surprisingly liked it...so i thought about it and decided to watch SAO S3 and give this season a try and its not bad at all :D<br />
<br />
STORY 7/10 :the story is a good one tbh...after s2&#039;s nonsense this story is actually what sao needs :D kirito is experiencing a new kind of game where he can separate his soul and thoughts from the real world....and in the new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295028">
        game world he meets this guy Eugeo...they have a female friend named alice who was kidnapped due to the violation of rules and they decide to save her in a long journey :D<br />
<br />
i find the story quit interesting to be honest...but i think it would have turned into a really better story if they would have given it a little more thoughts :D<br />
<br />
ART 10/10 :i always loved sao&#039;s art..cute and charming *~*<br />
<br />
SOUND 10/10 :i actually love the soundtracks....op and ed are great...the inst OSTs are perfect too...i never imagined that i would like the soundtracks of this season :D<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 7/10 : so here we go...<br />
kirito is much more stable than before...i mean what was that crapy s2 :/ just delete it already...i hated him after s2...here he became a character that i am a little more interested in :D :D asuna is back to her senses after the movie thats for sure :D <br />
sinon is not a important character here thank god really -_- i don&#039;t care about her anymore so please let me keep this i don&#039;t care thing for her...please -_-<br />
Eugeo a new character with an innocent personality and fighting spirit...he learns how to use a sword from kirito and he can actually fight like him somehow :D i like him...he is my favorite character in SAO s3 :D<br />
and alice...we don&#039;t know so much about her...just that she is kirito and Eugeo&#039;s childhood friend in the game with a special healing ability :D<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 8/10 :i enjoyed the most of sao s3&#039;s episodes not all of them but i didn&#039;t expect it to be enjoyable at all so 8 is a decent number for this :D<br />
<br />
OVERALL 8/10 :so i&#039;m actually enjoying this anime wo0ow...i never would have thought that this would happen...so if you liked SAO&#039;S MOVIE be aware that you will like SAO&#039;s s3 too...give it a try :D<br />
and for those who wants to know...the story is something new really...its a different season from S1 &amp; S2 :) those who didn&#039;t like those two seasons might like this one idk :))<br />
<br />
so here we are watching kirito does his gaming adventure again with a new MALE friend thank god :D Enjoy~~<br />
<br />

    Reki Kawahara&#039;s...Magnum Opus???<br />
<br />
Sword Art Online: Alicization gives us another installment of Kirito and the gang but this time Kirito wakes up in a game world like no other. No Asuna, No sword, new world.<br />
<br />
If there was a weakest link in Sword Art Online...ironically enough was Kirito but in Sword Art Online: Alicization he FINALLY gets his due and develops, instead of the being Hacking OP Game Jesus he&#039;s known for.<br />
<br />
Ok, so it seems Reki Kawahara has gone back to his roots with Sword Art Online: Alicization and looked back into his flaws of the Aincrad arc and saw it&#039;s immense flaws and decided to give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304911">
        Kirito a fighting chance of him actually developing as a character, fleshing out his new game world and what it means to Kirito and his new companion Eugeo voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki. With how Sword Art Online: Alicization was formatted and planned out, the anime really takes it&#039;s time with it&#039;s pacing being for the most part, moderately slow, slowly drip feeding up exposition about the game world and giving us enough information to us to to speed to the world Kirito is in and to be honest with how the first few episodes introduced everything, LA and the audience would had been easily in the dark, so the exposition at the start is necessary.<br />
<br />
With the world building, well since Kirito knows this new game world of Underworld is a game world, he exploits basic features and weirdly enough he has admin privileges (but not to worry he doesn&#039;t outright abuse it) let alone the fact that allies and villains use it just as well as he does, so it&#039;s even footing either way. The world building through Sword Art Online: Alicization was actually VERY well done, giving us a Chehov&#039;s gun payoff that gets mentioned and utilized well throughout the anime, almost like LA is watching someone playing an MMO game in a ways. Of course latter down the line, exposition does somewhat become a problem with episodes dedicated to certain characters backstories and world building lore of sometimes tie simplest things that didn&#039;t exactly need that much detail but noted either way.<br />
<br />
So characters, well as LA said before Kirito grows as a Gary Stu FINALLY, with him not being an all powerful main protagonist this installment, well he like Reki Kawahara, he doesn&#039;t want his mistakes from his past to haunt him and this is through him wanting to protect those close to him  Eugeo and Alice voiced by Ai Kayano, both a &quot;childhood friend&quot; in Underworld, so say that Kirito actually develops as a character is a feat and quite honestly one of the best signs that that Reki Kawahara knew Kirito needed more development from the start. Eugeo is something of a companion, &quot;best friend&quot; character towards Kirito, heck he grows from the meek, shy and orderly character to a more confident character through the course of the anime and latter his desires are tested. Alice, the psudeo-namesake of &quot;Alicization&quot;, at first gets &quot;put on the bus&quot; thus her screentime was diminished, but once she comes back into focus, well she&#039;s quite different to say, but nonetheless like Kirito and Eugeo, grows in a ways more like showing the authority of the higher ups of Underworld is not what she thinks it is...and to say that Alice was LA&#039;s favorite character of Sword Art Online: Alicization is a frickin&#039; understatement, a lady of war, a badass and pretty much Shinon 2.0 without the &quot;harem disease&quot; status, she was and IS a fully realized character that isn&#039;t just harem bait. <br />
<br />
On terms of villains, well they are major step up from the Aincrad and fairy Dance arc villains by a MILE, as they at best are shown as sympathetic characters, sometimes against their will, yes they are obstacles for Kirito and Eugeo, but we learn more about them, through their battles and they just aren&#039;t so stock, that you kinda feel sorry for some of them. As for the major villain of Sword Art Online: Alicization, well LA &quot;gets&quot; her intentions and she&#039;s malicious and even with her backstory covered and whatnot, she does have a purpose, not ony a threat to Kirito and Eugeo but humankind, because in game terms, she&#039;s pretty much a self-aware rogue program out for blood and &quot;shake fist at God&quot; villain, she&#039;s an existential nihilist doing only what she does to survive. So depth and not stock evil?...yeah leagues better in many ways.<br />
<br />
Sword Art Online: Alicization&#039;s animation done by A1-Pictures is almost movie quality to how polished and detailed it is, almost like they got the animators from ordinal Scale and got them to work on Sword Art Online: Alicization and to be honest, the animation done by A1-Pictures was stellar, great and detailed character designs and crazy sword battles. There were some censors but to be honest needed as Sword Art Online: Alicization does get indeed graphic and in one notorious episode where censors (though LA hates them), helped..in a ways. A1-Pictures really outdid themselves really. Exceptional quality and consistency and A1 did it.<br />
<br />
Voice acting, well you know LA is just gonna praise the hell out of Ai Kayano as Alice, but to say that Nobunaga Shimazaki as Eugeo and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Kirito also needs to get a mention. The only other voice actors to note are Sakura Tange as Cardinal with her odd but enticing cadence and the major villain of Sword Art Online: Alicization voiced by Maaya Sakamoto who did excellently in portraying the oozing amount of villainess contempt she had.<br />
<br />
If there were any flaws LA could see in Sword Art Online: Alicization, well there are of course, but one is that the exposition does not necessary kill but drag the plot, yes the exposition is useful for the plot ahead but still. Sword Art Online: Alicization does feel very much like a game world what with all the exposition layed out, but there are time sin the plot where it was a bit contrived and coincidental at times, yes you can call this plot armour for Kirito and Eugeo, but LA will defend this flaw as Kirito isn&#039;t the god he was in the first season as in Sword Art Online: Alicization and Kirito goes through a personal development about the same plot armour being broken and hell he loses, he gets wrecked. But to say around the middle of the anime, it does get a bit coincidental to save the main protagonists...not utterly forced thankfully. Sword Art Online: Alicization has it&#039;s problems, but it&#039;s strengths definitely outweighs it&#039;s weaknessness.<br />
<br />
Sword Art Online: Alicization is getting a continuation of it in a second season but for what Sword Art Online: Alicization gave us as of now, it&#039;s not only a HUGE step up from Reki Kawahara, but it&#039;s definitely on it&#039;s way to being amazing. It seems Reki Kawahara goal of righting his wrongs of Sword Art Online is indeed showing and for the first half, it already showed it&#039;s potential in being something great, let&#039;s just hope the second season follows through and gives us an excellent climax to what&#039;s ahead.

    First first off, this is like the third time I am posting this because &quot;I didn&#039;t watch enough episodes before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, so first off, let me tell you that I have been an SAO fan for a while, as it will always have a social place in my heart, so if you take my review with a grain of salt that&#039;s fine.<br />
<br />
STORY - 9<br />
<br />
So far, the plot looks enticing, and with A-1 Pictures giving SAO Alicization 4 cours instead of 1 or 2, I don&#039;t suspect nearly as many plot jumps to happen as there were in SAO season 1. The working principles of the new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295541">
        VR device, the Soul Translator (was in the trailer, not a spoiler), do open up a lot of potholes, however, but so did the concept of the Nervegear. I mean, microwaves?! As we are now 10 episodes in, I see that the story is flowing very nicely, and everything feels well-paced. Episode 10 was a shocker, and it&#039;s bumped my story grade up to 9.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART - 10<br />
<br />
The animation in the entirety of the SAO series as well as other animations by A-1 is always very good. Originally, I thought A-1 could only hold the first episode&#039;s animation quality for one or two episodes, but boy, was I wrong. This season is rivaling even Ordinal Scale&#039;s quality! On a WEEKLY basis, mind you! Maybe they can keep this up for a year (or longer, if the cours are split), and maybe they can&#039;t, but even still, I don&#039;t expect anything to look worse than an 8/10 by the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND - 9<br />
<br />
Likewise with the animations, the music in SAO is top notch. Somewhere in the middle of the first episode, it did sound kind of funny when Kirito waved his photon sword in front of the camera (almost like a fart, maybe it&#039;s just me), but other than that, I didn&#039;t notice any anomalies. As for the soundtrack, it does not disappoint, and fits relatively well with the scenes shown, even if a lot of the soundtrack is reused from previous seasons. After episode one, the soundtrack has been staying solid as well, and so have the sound effects. <br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - 8<br />
<br />
Okay, so to a lot of people, the characters were the worst point of SAO, so I will try and be impartial here. During the first episode, I did not know which characters would get more time in the spotlight, but it still seemed as though Kirito was OP as always in VR, and Asuna was all over him. No, seriously. I nearly died laughing when she showed Sinon the thing about the heartrate, mainly because of her expression at that point. Bit creepy, but the reasoning behind it is cute, I guess. After three more episodes, I can already tell this will top even the Aincrad arc. For one, Kirito is not unbearably OP, and we get to see his struggles. To not spoil anything, I will just tell you to watch the series yourself. As of episode 10, I can say that characters are developing well, and everything is going great! Antagonists are EXTREMELY hate-able!<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 10<br />
<br />
Like I said, SAO has always had a special place in my heart, and the first ten episodes have not changed that. If they have, they have made me like it even more! This season is sure to be great, and these first ten episodes (the first one being 47 minutes) definitely did not disappoint. I found myself waiting every week, wanting to know what would happen next. Even if you dislike SAO, I am literally urging you to try this new season out to, at the very least, neutralize negative feelings towards it.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL - 9<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Definitely worth a watch, even if you are not an SAO fan. If you have not watched the previous seasons, you will definitely be lost for some parts, so watch them first.

    I scrolled through some of the reviews on this and I say 10s, plural, this show is not very good. As you can see from, my score I didn&#039;t love this season, my emotions ranged from excitement (surprisingly), to boredom, to hate. Mainly boredom though. <br />
<br />
The show starts off  ambiguously with us straight in the game world, the art and animation look great, the fantasy ambient music is playing in the back. It makes the first initial seconds feel really atmospheric. Your introduced to the first two main character as kids, within the first 3 minutes they come off as really endearing and loveable.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304932">
        I really can&#039;t give enough praise for the first episode or at least it&#039;s first half. The first episode is 40 mins long with the first part taking place in game and the second outside. If you&#039;ve ever played Assassins Creed, you&#039;ll get a similar feeling when watching this. I love the in game world. I hate everything outside.<br />
<br />
The outside world doesn&#039;t play as significant  a part as the initial episodes might lead you think. The main problem with them is it&#039;s just boring there&#039;s no real progression of the story everything outside of the in game world serves as a prelude to the events in game or as exposition neither serve to further the plot. Episode 5 and 6 are especially guilty of this. What are they? Two episodes of straight exposition, it so boring, I don&#039;t know who thought it was a good idea to do this. It took me 5 sittings to watch these two episodes, two of which I fell asleep in. That tbh is the main problem with this it sort of disguises itself with the high production quality of its earlier episode but is mediocre. Nothing really happens past episode 12, Kirito and Eugeo enter a tower where they fight for 5 mins and listen to exposition for the rest.<br />
<br />
By far what cemented this show as mediocre in my mind though was the ending,ignoring the garbage cliffhanger and setup for a a sequel, the whole situation that leads up to that makes no sense. The antagonist has no meaningful  characterisation whatsoever, she&#039;s evil because she wants power or somehing like that. The whole final battle  before the final battle and the final battle itself make no sense. It&#039;s really badly choreographed, it&#039;s just the same fight scene you see in every other action anime with a respectable budget. Things just sort of happen and if your looking, not watching or are maybe younger in age this might appease you but if that does not apply to you then like me you might just be like, wtf. You would be right as well because none of this is explained, it just happens.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s so much more that&#039;s wrong, Kiritos lack of characterization, the lack of interesting characters with this but I&#039;m tired of typing. This show went from being really exciting  for what I&#039;d hoped to be a good season of a show that I was fond of in my childhood but just turned out to be boring. Really boring.
