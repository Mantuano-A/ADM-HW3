    When people think of mechas in anime, they automatically think of shows like Gundam, Macross, Code Geass, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and even Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. They think of flashy combat (sometimes with lots of missiles), lots of action, explosions, more fights, lots of gutsy shouting, etc, etc. Of all the shows on offer though, very few actually portray mechs as something..... utilitarian. <br />

Released in 1989, Patlabor: The Movie (the name is taken from the Patrol Labors used in the show), followed the story set by the original 7 episode OVA from 1988/9, and featured a completely original story written by Headgear (a group of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21232">
        5 writers and artists who work in anime and manga). Produced by Studio Deen, Production I.G. and Bandai, and directed by Headgear&#039;s own Oshii Mamoru, the movie received critical acclaim from a broader public spectrum than any other at the time, in particular because of it&#039;s &quot;novel&quot; use of all things mecha.<br />
<br />
The movie, set in Tokyo in 1999, begins with a man throwing himself off a giant steel structure in Tokyo Bay. The structure is called The Ark, a man made island where the Babylon project is coordinated, and the man who commits suicide is Hoba Eiichi, a programmer who worked on the project. <br />
<br />
Shortly after his death, Labors (the mechs in the show), around the city begin to malfunction and go out of control, and it&#039;s up to the members of the Section 2&#039;s Special Vehicles 2nd Division to sort things out. However, Captain Gotoh of the 2nd Division supects that everything is not as it seems.<br />
<br />
One the the truly great things about Patlabor: The Movie is that it actually has a very good story to back it up. Granted that this is in some measure due to there being an OVA already available before the film was released, but be that as it may, the fact remains that Patlabor is one of the most well scripted anime titles around - even now. That said, anyone who&#039;s familiar with the work of Oshii Mamoru, or of Headgear, will know that their pieces are generally extremely well written and directed. <br />
<br />
One of the gripes that people have with this movie is that they consider it too wordy and tedious. The plot may appear slow to some, but don&#039;t be fooled into thinking that this is a boring movie. The story progresses like a slow burning fuse, with numerous twists and turns throwing events in a new direction. The show begins with a mystery - why did Hoba Eiichi kill himself - but investigating this event only brings up more mysteries, more conundrums, and as the movie progresses the tension continues to rise ever so slowly and gently. One of the most impressive aspects of the plot is that the viewer may not even realise that they&#039;re inching further to the edge of their seat, such is the subtlety of the build up. <br />
<br />
In truth, this movie isn&#039;t meant for kids or people who expect mech shows to be all about guts and flashy combat. This, like Oshii Mamoru&#039;s later work, Ghost in the Shell, is a show aimed very much at a more mature, more rational audience (i.e. those able to breath and talk at the same time). The main reason people complain about this film is because they think it doesn&#039;t contain enough mech on mech combat, shouting or gutsy pilots, and while one can accept that the movie doesn&#039;t show much in the way of mech action, it was never meant to from the start. The mechas in the Patlabor franchise are far more useful and utilitarian than in almost any other show, with Labors being used in many aspects of society - law enforcement, construction, emergency services, heavy industry, military, etc, etc. It&#039;s a surprisingly normal, and very &quot;novel&quot; (in terms of anime), usage of mechas that isn&#039;t really reflected anywhere else, and more closely follows the doctrine of the &quot;real robot&quot; than just about any other mech show. <br />
<br />
Which neatly leads me on to design and animation. <br />
<br />
One of the key aspects of any mecha show is the design of the robots themselves. Many purists consider this element to be one of the prime factors in whether one likes the show or not, and while I can agree with that sentiment to a degree, for me it&#039;s not the be all and end all. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s nice to know then, that the design of the mechs in Patlabor: The Movie was left to another member of Headgear - Izubuchi Yutaka. Fans of RahXephon will recognise the name as both the creator and director of that series, and his credits also include work on Gundam, Jin-Roh (Kerberos Saga), Gasaraki, and several other shows. Izubuchi&#039;s designs in Patlabor are a far cry from almost every other mech show though, and reflect their utilitarian purposes in a way that no other show has managed. For example, construction Labors actually look like they belong on a construction site, and are coloured yellow like most heavy equipment used in that industry. Police Labors are sleeker, are coloured black and white, and have flashing lights (and sirens in some cases). Each mech in the movie is designed for a specific purpose, and it&#039;s because of this diversity of design that Patlabor is lauded as the epitome of &quot;real world&quot; robot design by many mecha fans - something which no other anime franchise has portrayed before or since.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for some (not for me though), the mechs play second fiddle in Patlabor, and much of the action takes place with the characters themselves. It&#039;s nice therefore, to see that character designer Takada Akemi (another member of Headgear), was on the same page as Izubuchi when it came to realism. From Captain Goto Kiichi&#039;s world weary, droopy eyed face, to Izumi Noa&#039;s perky, bubbly, and happy go lucky expressions, the characters designs are as indiviual as they come, and fit each characters personalities almost perfectly.<br />
<br />
This realistic approach doesn&#039;t stop with the mecha or character design though. The scenery is detailed and descriptive, something which can&#039;t normally be said, and the reason for this is because the prodcution staff based much of the scenery on photos taken from around Tokyo - something which is a rarity in anime (although the game Shenmue used the same method years later).<br />
<br />
As for the animation itself, it is nothing short of impressive, even now. Given that the movie is now 20 years old, the lack of CG doesn&#039;t hold it back in any way. This movie is easily one of the most well animated pre-90s productions available, and even manages to hold it&#039;s own when compared to many modern day mech offerings. The production quality is so good in fact, that it even holds up in terms of how it sounds.<br />
<br />
As a card carrying fan of subtitles, there are very few shows that I will even consider watching with an English dub. Patlabor: The Movie is one of them. In all honesty, both the Japanese and original English dubs (not the re-issued version by Bandai), are equally excellent, especially as the English dub adopts an intuitive rather than a literal approach (something which made it a rarity in those days). The cast for either dub are talented actors and actresses who are able to provide a depth and feeling that, especially in the original english dub, is rare to see.<br />
<br />
The music used throughout the film is composed by Kawai Kenji, who also provided the music for the first two GitS movies, and ranges from grand and dramatic to languid, almost calm. The choreography between visuals and music is handled extremely well, a hallmark of Oshii&#039;s directing skills, and the overall presentation is truly splendid. In terms of effects, the movie is also well served in the range and usage of the various sounds and noises. It&#039;s nice to hear mechs that sound like mechs should, and the range of noises associated with the mechs is choreographed to fit it&#039;s particular type as well. Granted there&#039;s a limit on how much one can differentiate between two mechs in terms of how they sound, but at the very least the effort was made and the movie should be applauded for that.<br />
<br />
Or is anyone going to tell me that a JCB and a patrol car sound the same?<br />
<br />
I mentioned earlier that the mechs in Patlabor: The Movie play second fiddle to the characters, and if one decides to watch this movie then that fact should be kept very firmly in mind. Patlabor is a character driven story rather than a mecha showcase, and because of this the movie has more depth than can be found in most series. While one could argue that shows like Gundam, Macross, CG, etc, etc, are also character driven pieces, one has to remember that mechs play a central role in those stories. Here though, the tale follows a very human path that is less about combat and confrontation, and more about investigation, deduction, reasoning, and working things out. Patlabor: The Movie is essentially a detective drama that just happens to include mechs, and much of the interaction of the characters actually reinforces the belief that these robots are simply &quot;tools of the trade&quot; rather than anything wondrous or special. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s because of this realistic interaction between the characters as they go about their work that many consider Patlabor: The Movie a classic of the first order. The characters all have their individual gripes and foibles, much like you get in any workplace, and it&#039;s the sense of normality brought on by this that permeates the show, and makes it truly special. That said, because this is a movie there&#039;s only so much development that can occur, however there is some, especially with regards to Izumi Noa and Shinohara Asuma. What sets the movie apart though, is the strong characterisations that are present throughout, as this offsets any lack of real development rather nicely, and while it&#039;s advisable to watch the original OVA before watching the movie, in truth, it&#039;s not actually necessary. Most people will find that they watch the movie first, and will watch the rest of the franchise because they want to know more about the characters, their history, how the mechs developed, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
So, will you enjoy this?<br />
<br />
Well, if you&#039;re like me, and you like a bit of detective drama coupled with conceptualisation and philosophical debate, then this is the movie for you. If you like character driven stories with a slow build up of tension then this is for you. If you like your mech shows to have a bit more depth to them then this may be what you&#039;re looking for.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a pre-90&#039;s show that&#039;s better than Akira, then this is it.<br />
<br />
If all you&#039;re after is flashy combat, powerful mechs, cool pilots, and overly convoluted plots, then this may not be your cup of tea (but it&#039;s still worth trying anyway).<br />
<br />
And apologies for the essay, but one can say a hell of a lot about something that&#039;s truly good.<br />
<br />

    Today I bring you another Giant Mech seires, but it&#039;s not Gundam. Today I&#039;m gonna introduce you to another popular Mech seires called Patlabor. I really don&#039;t know much about this series but&#039;s really solid stuff. Think of it as a cross over of Gundam and Ghost In The Shell. What really got me into this movie was the mystery, not the battle scenes. <br /><br />Okay, the story takes place in the present day 1999 (well this anime was made in the 80&#039;s), and in the middle of Tokyo Bay a new building is being built. The Mobile Police force has been assembled to prevent anyone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148">
        from destroying it. While this is happening a whole bunch of other Patlabor mechs have been going on random rampages. As they try to figure out the mystery to they quickly find out it&#039;s the building that&#039;s making all the Patlabor&#039;s go beserk. But how? Well you&#039;ll have to see the movie to see what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />As my last qoute on this, it&#039;s an anime worth watching, even though it&#039;s kinda retro. To be an anime fan you have to like many of the old animes before you can start obsessing over the new ones. Patlabor the Movie is a must see.

    [Perhaps a shorter review than usual, but I want to test out how well I can analyse an anime without taking notes]<br />
<br />
Mobile Police Patlabor has always been an intriguing franchise mainly because of how grounded its setting is despite it being a mecha anime. This isn&#039;t the first time such a creative decision has been utilized, but what makes Patlabor unique is how this fictional device we call mecha is integrated within its world. Labors, the mechs in question, are highly useful tools for, well, labor; Japan contains these machines in the thousands, and their inclusion is natural and seamless.<br />
<br />
In Movie 1, labors are the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315708">
        root of a major problem, as they have become defective and are out of control, following an upgrade to their system, which, for the majority of the film, is a subject of investigation, deemed dubious. Immediately, I liked the theme the film is conveying; critiquing technology, and the potential danger it possesses if left unchecked, as well as the possibility of its reliability rendering humans obsolete in the workforce. It is certainly fascinating in retrospect; discourse surrounding technology and its impact permeates throughout all forms of media, and regardless of your stance, it is undeniable the societal influence technology holds, and Patlabor is a rather suitable parallel. In my opinion, at least, Patlabor&#039;s world is timeless, and reflective of reality even in 2019. Despite the primitive gadgets on display, this is not why I hold this belief, but actually, as mentioned earlier, because of how realistic the setting is, and how the almost otherworldly advancement in technology compliment one another. It isn&#039;t the tech itself, but how it is presented. There are cube-shaped monitors and floppy disks, so dated, am I right? Sure, but I often apply such criticism against a show, say, set in space thousands of years into the future.<br />
<br />
On a technical level, Patlabor is expectedly sublime; the cinematography is consistently gorgeous and often experimental, as we encounter a shouting match through a fish eye lens, a vehicular action scene through a POV shot, just to name a couple of examples. Combine this with Mamoru Oshii&#039;s vision; his use of heavy shadows, reflection, glaring and colourful lighting, cycling between day and night, this technical attention to detail is commonplace for an Oshii production, and is why, visually, few can compete. Kenji Kawai&#039;s music is also a treat to listen to, as it ranges from ominous and foreboding, to intense and upbeat. These aspects only get better in the sequel.<br />
<br />
Patlabor&#039;s characters are charming enough, though are unfortunately not as fleshed out as its alternative, Patlabor: On Television. However, they retain and carry over their likeability nicely. I will say, I am thankful the cast talk and interact like actual human beings, and have distinguishable personalities that are not too obvious, and what I mean by this is, for example, Gotoh is very level-headed and intelligent, but his body language can also be interpreted as lax, and, because he is seen to be smoking a lot, maybe undergoing a lot of stress, while having to maintain a collected mindset. This is a welcome nuance that can really add to a character, and is not too painfully obvious.<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier, the characters are likeable, distinguishable and charming, but something I disliked was the fleshing out of the characters compared to the TV series. This stands to reason, given how the series has more to work with, but this is emblematic of how insistent the film is to cram this large cast into an hour and a half production, as if audiences are already expected to have a good idea about what these characters are about. It&#039;s naive to believe a film wouldn&#039;t be a more simple introduction to a franchise vs. a commitment-heavy TV series spanning 47 episodes, at least that that&#039;s how I see it. I&#039;ve seen the TV show, but this was some time ago, so I had a decent idea of how the cast behaves and their personalities prior to watching the first film again, but it affected my investment somewhat. Furthermore, a lot of the film can contain dialogue in abundance, too much, arguably, especially given how, generally, such scenes required little movement, and it can grow jarring struggling to navigate the world&#039;s terminology without getting lost, while simultaneously attempting to uncover the story&#039;s mystery.

    Ah, how do I love to take a good look behind me and see how far I&#039;ve come...<br />
There was a time when I believed that the only mecha anime that would provide intelligent morality with some &quot;Oooooh, that was cool!&quot; fighting, was Gundam. I&#039;m sure a majority of people might agree with that.<br />
<br />
But after seeing just one movie, I can say with a straight face(hopefully, writing it &quot;straight out&quot; will suffice XD), that there&#039;s another mecha which has even more realism and practical intelligence.<br />
Remember the name Patlabor, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, this movie does several things which are completely optional and unrequired of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35842">
        director to care about, but Oshii decides to anyway.<br />
He allows people to thoroughly understand and immerse themselves with his future, and surprising realistic vision of Tokyo.<br />
We, as watchers, should be aware that this movie is technically a sequel in the canon, but Oshii does us a favor by familiarizing us with the staff and crew of the Patlabor.<br />
But what is the Patlabor? How is this futuristic mecha anime different from the rest.<br />
Well, who agrees that it&#039;s more believable to minimalize worldwide conflict by simply having the robots enforce their own lands? Well, that&#039;s what the Patlabor unit is all about; policing.<br />
Oshii,a real master of not explaining his sci-fi, allows viewers to feel the difference between our world and theirs. No matter how advanced, we can always envision the future he&#039;s showing us.<br />
The movie&#039;s message is one of the more grounded and basic of science fiction stories, but it feels fresh here too, because it fits the context.<br />
<br />
With rapid accelerations of technology and an even faster need to learn and understand it, a picture of people being blinded by that overwhelming scenario is thoroughly illustrated.<br />
Mechanics reminisce about when things were clear-cut and basic, police can remember old metropolis that have been replaced by newer buildings and such.<br />
And the mecha, dubbed Labors, have things called OS&#039;(yes, like Windows &quot;98&quot;), that help commanding it easier.<br />
<br />
With a plot that focus&#039; more on human&#039;s self-destructive unintentional ways, and mood and tone that speaks in words that only adults can take in pleasantly,<br />
there&#039;s still only on big weakness with the movie.<br />
It lacks impact. It&#039;s execution doesn&#039;t give off the impression that we should learn something from it, or that we are in impending danger. It just feels like it&#039;s just another standard job for the Patlabor!<br />
Well, a job where the baddie has the IQ of 200 instead of 50. You do the math.<br />
<br />
Who&#039;s seen an ugly Oshii movie? I haven&#039;t. I&#039;ve seen dark, colorless, and moody, but never ugly.<br />
Mecha designer Yutaka Izubuchi, whose probably best known for RahXephon, and for designing the mecha in Gundam Char&#039;s Counterattack, should just as easily be remembered for how he presents these riot-control bots.<br />
Even though it&#039;s a bit far-fetched to see a Labor quieting down an actual street riot, it&#039;s not uncommon to see them stop malfunctioning or joyriding Labors that pile up debris as they go.<br />
Perhaps being responsible to both sides, there&#039;s Labors for domestic and policing creating one of the biggest highlights.<br />
<br />
The other highlight would be everything else! No, I&#039;m serious.<br />
The backgrounds&#039; multi-layers makes almost any movement beautiful, sweeping, and integrating. There&#039;s nary a time where something doesn&#039;t have that extra piece of detail.<br />
Elevator movement, forest, fortress labyrinth, urban, etc. The movie has many backgrounds, all of which are A(Akira)-class level.<br />
<br />
I love Kenji Kawai&#039;s music, but man, does he never cut loose!<br />
In almost everything he&#039;s in, rarely is he used for anything other than tone setting. He&#039;s still not a necessary component for part of the experience and thus, expendable.<br />
This is different from his performance in Ghost in the Shell, in that his music served the role of connection; it allowed viewers to see the world of cybernization as it is.<br />
Here, we&#039;re just seeing how destructive we&#039;re getting as time goes on.<br />
And other than that, the music is mostly for the battles. Very basic stuff.<br />
The score itself is fine, but what&#039;s most important is what it&#039;s for.<br />
You wanna see some of his best? Check out Moribito&#039;s soundtrack on YouTube.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m giving extra kudos to the characters, because behavior is everything in a sci-fi; if the people don&#039;t behave like robots are new but common tools, then everything else falls apart.<br />
Likewise, if the Patlabor unit didn&#039;t treat their weapons or mechs in ways most cops do about their personal sidearm/effects they take on the job then immersion is incomplete.<br />
Personality wise, we don&#039;t have enough time to truly like them. We have enough to understand and see who they are, but we can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s only for this movie.<br />
<br />
In fact, it&#039;s quite difficult to tell whose the main character. Or to be more exact, which main character is more important.<br />
This falls into the realistic range that all of the police play parts in the story, but I digress.<br />
If this is your first time watching Patlabor, or even Oshii, you&#039;re gonna want to lower the score of this section down a couple of notches.<br />
Even though it passes with flying colors on believability, you won&#039;t see their &quot;off-duty&quot; natures as you would with Ghost in the Shell.<br />
<br />
What can I say, Oshii movies are slow, methodical, brooding, and passive.<br />
It takes stretches of time before we can see anything fast paced.<br />
When things do heat up, you&#039;ll want it a remaining constant, and when it dies down, you&#039;ll stop the movie.<br />
This is a common fan, who just got off the latest battle from One Piece.<br />
Let me remind you once; treat this like slowly digestible brain food, not a bag of Hot Cheetos!<br />
<br />
But even so, Patlabor is a staple of mecha-science fiction, simple as that.<br />
<br />
It deserves it for a many of reasons, but the greatest one is that we can understand it.<br />
We can truly envision the scenario and message in our future, this is even more fantastic than say the achievements of Ghost in the Shell, because here we have higher chances of putting it to practical use.<br />
Despite it&#039;s serviceability, people don&#039;t watch anime for that, which is Oshii&#039;s biggest fault.<br />
Miyazaki may preach, but at least he puts a colorful mask on when doing it. Kon may throw our brains into a blender, but at least the experience is joyous instead of murderous.<br />
The point being, that before you push &quot;Play&quot;, know what you&#039;re watching.<br />
<br />
Now.... I wonder how Patlabor 2 is...<br />
<br />
Letter Grade Time(LGT)<br />
Story: B<br />
Art: A<br />
Sound: B-<br />
Animation: A+<br />
Characters: C+<br />
Enjoyment: C<br />
Overall: B-<br />
<br />
+ A well crafted science fiction that&#039;s perfectly understandable to the average Joe. Expert art/animation with responsible designing that fits into the nature. Music that nicely sets the mood and plugs people into the experience.<br />
- Not enough impact. Viewers will want more punch to their sci-fi, complete with faster pacing, likable characters, and more vividness to their action

    Ah Mamoru Oshii, a great man who can mold his characters to resemble something akin to that friendly neighbor, or that 40 year old fascist cab driver who keeps asking you whether you have a gun license...if you&#039;re reading this I&#039;ll tell you again, no I don&#039;t!<br />
<br />
Anyway, with Oshii&#039;s help and some superb voice acting (well I thought it was very fitting) the great story of another robot revolt comes to life. Of course this one&#039;s slightly different, using a very subtle reference to animals(and probably robots) knowing something that we don&#039;t, or are at least able figure it out before we do. But the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10395">
        major theme in Patlabor is clearly shown through the destructive force of the out of control mecha, and it questions our unbridled advancements in technology and science. In upgrading our physical society at such an exponential rate we run the risk of giving it the reigns, unless we place equal focus on cultural society, and allow people to catch up, we may just be forcing ourselves into absolution. As some of the older characters in this film complain over their outdated knowledge, so does much of the aging workforce of today still scream to be recognized. There are also some biblical references which are used in varying ways to aid the story, the most interesting of those would be that of the ark (as in Noah&#039;s Ark), of course Patlabor doesn&#039;t use the bible to the extent of Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br />
<br />
As I said before, Oshii is able to craft realistic and like-able characters, with my personal favorite being Kiichi Goto; the captian. I&#039;d have to say the resemblance to Roy Mustang (FMA) is to close to be coincidental, but I&#039;m not complaining. A cool, collected individual who never looses his head (well...not usually), Goto manipulates his crew of trigger happy pilots, eager cadets, and intuitive technicians to his ends. This seems to be a more efficient way of getting things done rather than constantly using his rank.<br />
<br />
The art is very well done for its time, but still doesn&#039;t hold up to modern work in terms of clarity. However it does have a rustic charm that I enjoy, and some of the urban landscapes are still impressive, high rise skyscrapers, construction sites and demolished lots all reinforcing the sense of unrestrained development. Also be prepared for a great 80&#039;s soundtrack, you know the standard that was in any great action movie, Lethal Weapon, Terminator...the never ending story. <br />
<br />
The point is you&#039;ll enjoy the funny and realistic characters as well as the at times comical animation, but at the same time you&#039;re able to dig into a solid story that doesn&#039;t just say advancement=good (unlike everyone else).

    Studio Deen and Mamaru Oshii return after the original OVA series with a Patlabor movie sequel.<br />
<br />
Set in 1999 (ha), Tokyo is under heavy reconstruction to re-invent the city by tearing down old suburbs and building man-made islands in its place. It is called it the Babylon Project. With such a grand scale operation, an insane amount of Labors (robots made for construction work) are needed, and a Labor maintenance rig is built in Tokyo Bay call the “Arc.” Needless to say, a hidden plot is slowly unveiled as Labors start going wild without explanation threatening the project, the city, and the people.<br />
<br />
Well, this is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204342">
        job for the unorthodox division 2 of the Tokyo Metropolitan Labor Police Force. Our rambunctious group from D2 is back with Noa, Asum, Goto, and the whole gang working together to solve this mystery. All of the characters maintain everything which made them loved in the previous OVA installment. <br />
<br />
All music, artwork, and animation are as stunning as the OVA series. Sharp colors and terrific mech designs are fun to look at and with all of the action going on is a breath of fresh air compared to the OVA as a whole. Backgrounds of construction sites and city high rises are rustic and incredibly detailed. Even the music matches up with each scene whether it is action or intense moments of pause.<br />
<br />
Like in typical Oshii fashion, he has helped create an anime with lovable characters and a very interesting story as well. This anime is almost like a Gundam crossed with Ghost in the Shell. An action oriented mech anime with mystery elements is the best way to describe it, along with that great Patlabor humour.<br />
<br />
Mech and humour with a fantastic story is what makes Patlabor The Movie a must see.

    Patlabor the Movie is a wild and fun ride. Especially for someone coming off hot from the heels of the TV anime series or the OVAs.<br />
<br />
The movie balances the more anime like aspects of its art retained from the TV plus the OVAs into its movie setting. Lending a certain charm when contrasting it with its later sequel patlabor 2 which handles its art style in a more realistic fashion. <br />
<br />
The music is top notch and puts a stupid grin on your face, if only more anime would devote this much heart and soul to its music. <br />
<br />
I love this movie. It just feels like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421559">
        a payoff for getting yourself invested in these characters from either the OVA or the TV series. If I had to ding anything off this movie it would be the lack of characterization of some of the supporting characters and the lack of context to explain why they act in the manner they do. Which is addressed in the TV series but that&#039;s asking a little much.<br />
<br />
Should you watch this movie? If you&#039;re willing to at least watch the OVA series that came before to experience maximum enjoyment, then why are you reading a review of it?! Go watch it! As for the more casual or less invested viewer, you will find enjoyment in patlabor the movie. Though you will miss some of the little things related to the characters. <br />
<br />
Well that&#039;s that, hopefully I didn&#039;t waste too much of your time. Target, Lock On!

    A month after the conclusion of the Mobile Police Patlabor: Early Days OVA, the staff launched their coup de grace in the form of an hour and forty-minute movie. If you haven’t read my Early Days review then I recommend that you do, as this will reference it due to the fact it’s chronologically a sequel. This movie has the same members of Tokyo Mobile Police Force Section 2 combating their largest scale threat yet. A new operating system installed on Labor units across the country has been causing the machines to go berserk for reasons unknown. The programmer behind the OS is unavailable for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222353">
        interrogation on account of suicide. Section 2 begins a seemingly hopeless investigation into the mystery behind programmer Eiichi Hoba and his cutting-edge operating system. If the crew can’t politically prove foul play, then all of Japan is at risk for a level of chaos that could sink their economy.<br />
<br />
Mobile Police Patlabor: The Movie is considerably more serious in tone than most of the Early Days OVA. It’s most comparable to episodes four and five, the epic two-parter that likewise got away from the more comedy-focused adventures of the series. It’s thankfully not a jarring shift, because although Section 2 finds themselves on a much bigger case, their core personalities haven’t changed. The focus is shifted to Asuma Shinohara this time around, who’s taken special interest in the case due to the impact the scandal could have on his father’s company. Most of the movie is an investigation procedural which maintains interest for how surprisingly elaborate the mysterious plot increasingly turns out to be. There’s a good amount of political maneuvering that’s relayed by commander Kiichi Gotou. Careful consideration is given for the implications of Section 2’s movements on bureaucracy that help the audience buy enough into the plausibility of the story when all of this complication could’ve simply been hand-waved by lazier writing.<br />
<br />
This movie feels like a natural continuation of the themes the OVA hinted at over its run. It started as an episodic comedy about an under-achieving police force, but in their exploits the audience uncovers what’s actually a dystopian future rife with political corruption, environmental destruction, and terrorism. The naïve members of Section 2 hold on to their optimism by being mostly unawares of how this degradation gradually slipped under the noses, similar to real generalized society, and Gotou is the perpetual link to a more realistic albeit depressing perspective. Another layer to Patlabor’s world is uncovered through the advancing of the Babylon Project. In the OVA this was introduced as a construction project to build a wall to deal with rising sea levels, and here it has broadened its scope into creating artificial islands in order to confront shrinking land mass. I won’t spoil the plot, but the antagonist is the most interesting yet. We get a feel for how a world like Patlabor’s actually impacts the individual rather than broad civilization. There’s an anti-industrialization sentiment at the movie’s core that seems to be a commentary on contemporary Japan’s industrialization movement cutting into long-held traditions of sentimentality and individuality. Mamoru Oshii’s routine perspective on the idea that human beings are becoming numbers and miniscule cogs ties this movie into the rest of his oeuvre.<br />
<br />
Kenji Kawai’s music is noticeably better here than in Early Days, seemingly making big strides towards the quality his reputation is known for. There’s much of the same synthesizer and electric guitar combination that’s definitive of 80s anime, but it all just sounds smoother than it ever did before and Kawai’s guitar riffs in particular are far more memorable and create appropriately powerful theme music. There’s more use of natural instruments this time around to suit the atmospheric ambiance of the investigation scenes, woodwinds in particular. A lot of the pulsing synthesizer work sounds similar to that of the original Terminator or a John Carpenter movie. The quality, variety, and synchronization of the music to the movie’s scenes has all greatly improved from Early Days.<br />
<br />
The production values are also suitably higher and certainly worthy of this larger production. The OVA was already impressive, so this is no small feat. There’s a scene in the middle somewhere where Asuma is looking up at the camera through a distorting fish-eye lens as a threatening message in red text flashes on his face repeatedly. I swear this same shot was used about a dozen times in Neon Genesis Evangelion. For the most part, the direction doesn’t hyperbolize reality too much in order to portray its story realistically. It’s still consummate, with care given to frame composition so that you aren’t staring at the same cels for too long. There are exceptions to this though, certain parts where the camera hangs far too long on a single frame that’s kept completely still. It can look pretty awkward when one character spends twenty seconds talking and revealing important information and five other faces on screen never change their facial expression in the middle. Just odd tidbits like that. Otherwise, this is a very worthy and well-edited movie.<br />
<br />
Patlabor: The Movie is well worth watching for fans, but it falls short of excellence. The themes are overly buried under the focus on the investigation, and they’re barren enough to the point they go past subtlety and simply undersell their weight and importance. The finale, which is otherwise extremely strong and the highlight of the movie, ends on a climax of plot resolution rather than addressing the themes the movie’s proposed. It’s too subtextual to be as profound as it could be, with the most relevant conversation taking place somewhere in the middle of the movie. With the themes pushed aside you have a high quality Patlabor plot that doesn’t become much greater than itself. I completely recommend watching the Early Days OVA first, as it’s not only first chronologically but it introduces the entire cast which doesn’t get as much focus during the movie. Patlabor is mainly enjoyable due to its likable cast of bums, and the implicit knowledge behind characters who aren’t featured as much this time around makes it much more possible to root for Section 2’s success as a whole. Furthermore, there’s an actual thematic progression from the themes of the OVA to the movie’s. Watching the movies first would be a mistake, but in the end this first movie delivers on an impressive quality worthy of the OVA. It can be argued, however, that it loses a bit of Patlabor’s character by getting away from the comedic malaise.

    Though the subgenre has been in a drought for several seasons, mecha anime is as prevalent as buddy cop films in the U.S.  But very VERY few can walk up to Gundam and pull a Captain America.  Patlabor is not just among the few, they lead the pack.<br />
<br />
A real robot series that puts Tokyo police into the titular Patrol LABORs, this first of three film adaptations of the Patlabor series retains the signature humor despite a more serious plotline.  Very crisp and detailed for an early 90s anime, it&#039;s one of the rare Oshii projects that isn&#039;t a meta philosophical drag. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396379">
        Plenty of Labor on Labor combat, a boots on the ground police investigation, and more destruction than the average kaiju.<br />
<br />
Definitely worth a marathon.

    Mobile Police Patlabor: The Movie is the first of three sequel movies to the OVA Early Days. The movie was made by Production I.G, and came out on July 15 1989. Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell) was the director for this movie.<br />
<br />
The movie takes place in 1999 and it still focuses on the same cast of characters from Special Vehicle Division 2. All the Labors have had a new OS installed called HOS, but it seems like this is making the drivers lose controll of their Labors. When SV2 looks into this it all seems to tie into a mysterious man who have commited

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261933">
        suicide on the massive Babylon Production construction site sets of a cascade of events that may signal the destruction of Tokyo.<br />
<br />
The characters are the same as in the Early Days OVA. If you wanna know more about them I suggest watching the OVA or read my review of the OVA. This movie doesn&#039;t really focus much on the characters in any way.<br />
<br />
The animation during the Labor fights are still as good as ever. They also liked to use a fisheye effect to add to the comedy during some scenes. Sadly though, I was expecting a bit more from the animation with this being a movie. It&#039;s not bad by any means, but there are times where it looked a bit wonky.<br />
<br />
I was not super impressed by the music in the OVA, so when I learned that Kenji Kawai had done the music for it I was even more disappointed. However, Kenji Kawai really stepped up his game for this movie. The music was a lot better and it made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall I thought this movie was good. The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, but come the middle point it starts to get a lot more interesting, and towards the end it got really exciting. The Patlabor franchize is good and I really recommend it for anyone who is on the fence about it. The mix between comedy and more serious police business is handled very well, and even if you&#039;re like me and not the biggest fan of mecha, I&#039;d say that there is so much to enjoy here that you&#039;re not even gonna think about the fact that it&#039;s a mecha show.

    Patlabor: The Movie<br />
<br />
This is a spoiler-free review.<br />
<br />
This movie is fantastic.  I first watched this film (and have rewatched it several times) without having seen the OVA&#039;s or the series it was based on.  <br />
You are not required to be familiar with them to enjoy this excellent story as it is self-contained and firmly establishes its own universe.<br />
<br />
Produced in 1989 and set in what was the near future the story and plot holds up surprisingly well in the current digital and ultra-information age.<br />
<br />
Where are we going?<br />
Who are we? <br />
<br />
This film, set in a completely realistic hard science fiction world, casually explores these questions without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71783">
        metaphysical hocus-pocus, cybernetics, or the lofty notions of artificial intelligence which director Mamoru Oshii would later explore in the equally stellar Ghost in the Shell movies. <br />
<br />
Instead, we are treated to a good old-fashioned intrigue with noir/detective elements, a view into police life, a view of machines and computers as tools in our society, and how these very things can contribute to the loss of heritage and the memory of regional history as a trade off for the increasing speed of progress.   <br />
<br />
Intelligent dialog between characters, corporate and police force politics, and a positive depiction of Section 2 as &quot;allies of justice&quot; instead of a run-of-the-mill cynical police force is a refreshing take on this pre-cursor to the often souped up fantasy mecha anime that emerged for the decade that followed this film. <br />
<br />
While there is plenty of subtext  and simple symbolism explored in an otherwise straight-forward plotline, the genius is in how the mysteries are solved and the ramifications to society is explored in a still-as-yet analog machine-centric world.<br />
<br />
The characters are real, warm, likeable, and believable as are the machines they use and pilot.  There are no quick-fixes as the story unfolds since humans still think, act and innovate in their environment and machines are simply tools that can be used for good or evil. <br />
<br />
The title sequences and ending moments may be action-packed, but all of it is driven by the scheming, thinking, and problem-solving characters rather than being a means unto itself. <br />
<br />
The animation holds up well, the sounds are surprisingly good but display the limited bandwidth in the era (and, I suspect, the budget for the genre at the time) and composer Kenji Kawai&#039;s musical score, while more dated than the rest of the film, serves to encompass and pay tribute to the analog nature of this film compared to it&#039;s digital successors that came afterwards. <br />
<br />
Make no mistake, this film&#039;s strength is in it&#039;s characters and plot and it&#039;s quite an enjoyable story.  High recommended.

    I wish that I could just write a shorter review, but I guess MAL only lets long stuff. <br />
<br />
This movie is good. But.<br />
<br />
The damn soundtrack is just a 10, more than a 10 in fact. Just so great makes me want to rewatch just for the music. <br />
<br />
Overall haven&#039;t heard that much Kenji Kawai but in terms of what I have, as great as GITS is, this soundtrack just slaps the hardest. <br />
<br />
I have said my piece. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, apparently that review was for some reason not long enough? Why is there such a long requirement. Wanted to just say a couple of words about the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389938">
        soundtrack and the magical Kenji Kawai but I guess I&#039;ll just have to throw in some run-on sentences just for the hell of it. <br />
<br />
At this point I guess I just will refuse to write anything more about the movie itself as good as it is. This just started as purely me wanting to say how much I liked the OST but I guess the MAL gods just won&#039;t let me have it easy huh. <br />
<br />
To summarize, good movie bro. Maybe I haven&#039;t mentioned the music yet.

    I did not like Noa as a protagonist in the original ova . So naturally when i saw Asuma take the leading role in this one , i was excited because he is both charismatic and smart and it was fun seeing him solve a mystery using his strengths . However , at the last moments of the final act Noa takes the lead once again , and i would be dissapointed , however she proved to be a capable fighter and that was a pretty good way to end this film .<br />

My god the christian symbolism , well this sure did pave the way

    &quot;&#039;As I tracked down his past, it felt like time was passing me by. Places I used to know were just rotting away, or had become empty ruins. Look away for even an instant and it&#039;s all gone. And it happens before I can even consider what it all means. I guess the past is worthless in this city.&#039;<br />
<br />
&#039;This spot was part of the ocean until recently. And in a few years, a huge city will rise up from the sea in front of us. But before you know it, that will become yesterday&#039;s junk too. It&#039;s like sitting through a sick joke.&#039;&quot;<br />
<br />
This film feels

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381892">
        kind of awkwardly pulled between two polls. On the one hand you have some more slow, methodical, contemplative exchanges like the above which pre-empt the tone that supposedly characterises the second film (I haven&#039;t seen it yet), and then, on the other, you have the lighthearted low-key character interactions from the decidedly slice-of-light comedy from the OVA and/or anime, plus a smattering of more standard actiony set pieces. All rolled up together, it doesn&#039;t really manage to excel at any of them, and largely comes and goes like a very inoffensive beautifully produced and hand drawn appetiser -- it doesn&#039;t fill you up.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I watched the OVA before this since I thought it would be good to get some context going into it. Now, I think that doing so probably isn&#039;t entirely necessary, you might find yourself confused at first by whoever the characters are and their relationships, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s anything you wouldn&#039;t be able to work out in the viewing process.
