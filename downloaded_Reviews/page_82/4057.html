    After catching a lesbian pedophile stare at his daughter, the real hero of this story, mr. papa went and hired her as a maid. Thanks to him, we now have a shojo ai anime about a lolicon maido and she is really into small girls. This is why the word &quot;perfectness&quot; was invented. <br />
<br />
The single best part of this show is the real main lolicon target girl who is half russian and whenever she is being assaulted (with overwhelming amount of love and warm feelings) by the maido, we hear some generic russian songs and they are really uplifting. The OST is just fantastic, best

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292624">
        one and most ruski score since Girls Und Panzer.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this is a comedy series, and the animation details highly serve this idea. Be it love arrows piercing the maido&#039;s hearto or side characters doing chuunimoe dance moves when teasing little girls, lots of detail is put in the visuals and it plays a big part in making this series so damn fun and entertaining to watch. The comedy side of this show is simply hilarious.<br />
<br />
Since the series is just slice of life with comedy elements, nothing of real importance really happens story-wise. Character interaction and character-centric goofs are put in a spotlight and they tend to radiate comfy and cuteness. And once again, those who are into this type of shit will have very few reasons to not love it. Maido is actually some sort of elite soldier, but she got unemployed. Now she is using her training to spy on our girl by climbing telephone poles and holding her breath for an hour just to see her bath. What is real important to note here is that this is much closer to 2pure4this world than lewd, and it exists to warm the hearts of its viewers. I, for one, have been forming sushi rolls with my blanket when viewing this for maximum comfy. <br />
<br />
However, more serious aspect also exists in the series, which is entirely relying on the main loli&#039;s feelings as she is dealing with some heavy concepts, the main one being the death of her mother. The series can at times get quite feels-stuff regarding this subject, and while these are often followed by maido drowning her in hugs and warmness, the series is not just all happy and goofy comedy, and this other side has played out rather well so far. In fact, it&#039;s rather unique concept to insert inside a comfy comedy series and it surely works here.<br />
<br />
Conclusions: so damn cute = 10 letters = 10/10.

    This season we have another anime about a pedophile, aren’t we tired of the same stuff? The most significant change is making the pedophile a female, pretty smart none will notice a lolicon maid being a pedophile. Well, is not clever, but I am giving the author some credit for trying something new. Honestly, I was surprised in the first episodes. The show was enjoyable, original, hilarious. After some episodes, I noticed the series re-used the same joke every time to have the comedy afloat. The anime that we praised became boring, irrelevant, and in the end, it is just another series that will be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296362">
        forgotten as an average comedy because the director does not hurry the pace of the main plot.  <br />
<br />
The plot is very straightforward with languid pacing because they focused more on the jokes than in the story itself. A lolicon maid falls in love with a young girl because she hasn’t her first period *roll my eyes* Yes, it is funny haha – I tried to laugh but I couldn’t, sorry. So, this maid became a stalker that follows the girl every time, asks for marriage (most all the time), she disguises to be with her. It is fun. The maid enthusiasm combined with the girl repulsion is hilarious. Sadly, since the same joke is repetitive, I got tired. Maybe I expected too much; the first episode delivered an animation quality out of the chart. That is very unusual for a comedy, but the plot quality at the end wastes the animation quality, and the show is now average. You can blame me and send me back into the medieval bonfire, but this show is boring and stupid. In the middle of the series since the first maid lacked humor, the author has the ingenious idea of adding a second maid with some masochism behavior. However, this does not change anything,  now we have two perverts for the price of one, and both do not fill the comedy moments showed from the beginning. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Misha, the girl, has a bright personality, and she is the only character that has some development during the story. She is charming, cheerful and is trying to continue her life after the death of her mom. Misha hates the lolicon maid aka Tsubame who has a bizarre personality, and Misha elaborates plans to get Tsubame fired. The maid is a stalker, lolicon, pedophile, she is a hard worker and wants to marry Misha. That is delightful. However, the constant repetition is tedious because in certain parts Misha looks like a person with schizophrenia awaiting Tsubame&#039;s assault. Perhaps that was the reason for adding three secondary characters to refresh the plot. Those are Midori aka the extra maid with a twisted personality. Mimika aka glasses and probably Misha’s best friend and since the MC needs someone that challenge her, they added Yui, that always wants to compete with Misha. About Tsubame, I wanted to know more about her but we got some sporadic scenes about her past, so her background is incomplete, sadly. <br />
<br />
One important aspect of this series is the animation, and it is impressive in the first episodes. Although, the quality changes and now is a mix of beautiful and weird. There are certain parts were the characters are rough and ugly and are more appreciable in the second half of the series. If we check the colors are very bright and charming. The palette is pleasant to the eye, and a lot of spectators will feel the series warming. <br />
<br />
The sound is very nice. The OST is very vivid and helps to catch the spectator in the hilarious moment. The OP and ED are average, but the rhythm buried the lyrics, however.   <br />
<br />
Finally, my verdict is average (5). I liked the first episodes and was near to give the series an 8 – 9. Nonetheless, after the half, I notice that the fun disappears. It is an alarm if you get rid and tired of the same jokes because the comedy fails. “Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru” issue is the lack of an outcome when it is needed. I disagreed when some persons said me that this show does not have a plot but is a combination of jokes. The show has a plot (Misha life after the death of her mom, that’s why her dad gets happy when Misha wants to share anything new with him, Tsubame life in the air force, how did she lose her eye, was Midori involved? That is called a plot) but if the director takes too much time deciding when to advance the main plot (last episode), that is another thing.  <br />

    This is a show about a pedophile. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s absolutely no debate about that fact, but I suppose there could be discussion on whether UzaMaid actually promotes pedophilia or not; in my opinion, it strays over the line that separates &quot;protected&quot; media (ie, media that displays immoral things objectively or simply for entertainment) from &quot;WTF is this icky crap&quot; (ie, media that glorifies the immoral/illegal/disgusting). In point of fact, the Maid in question says well over a dozen times that she isn&#039;t attracted to any girl who has had her first period. This is also shown in flashbacks at least twice. In every episode she also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339107">
        does illegal and morally dubious (at BEST) actions, such as sneaking into the bath of an 8-year-old, recording her sleeping, stalking her at school, rubbing her underwear, stealing clothes, collecting her hair, etc etc and so on.<br />
<br />
So, pedophile.<br />
<br />
I actually felt dirty watching UzaMaid at times, because every episode had a couple sequences that were just so...wrong. And not in a naughty way: I mean dirty in the way you feel after you accidentally pick off a mushy scab in the shower and it gets stuck under your fingernail.<br />
<br />
So why did I finish the show? Two reasons: the first is that I adore Doga Kobo to the point half my favorites list are productions by them. It&#039;s even better because I didn&#039;t realize they were behind all those anime until I accidentally noticed this about a week ago (which is why I began UzaMaid in the first place...&quot;it must be good, right!?&quot;) The second is that UzaMaid has two underlying strands that are IMMENSELY compelling: very good situational humor and a heartrending dramatic subplot that rui--ahem, is portrayed in the last three episodes. If some fan  were to remove all the pedo scenes this would be a fantastic anime.<br />
<br />
UzaMaid could E A S I L Y have stood on its own merits without all the fucking nasty shit Kamoi gets up to. Kamoi herself is a unique character; she&#039;s a military veteran who&#039;s totally jacked but also looks great in a maid outfit. She&#039;s smart, athletic, looks good, and has shockingly-deep backstory. The loli around whom Kamoi helicopters is animated well, voiced better, and has a strong enough personality to carry the series herself. All the supports are great too!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s actually heartbreaking, unironically. Like, who is UzaMaid supposed to appeal to? Normies will be utterly revolted by the pedophilia. Studio fans like me will hopefully be able to pretend that stuff isn&#039;t there and enjoy what&#039;s left, but will be wondering why it exists in the first place. And the third group, well, pedos don&#039;t get to have an opinion because monsters aren&#039;t people. So it&#039;s GOT to be that UzaMaid exists only to appeal to those subhumans, in my opinion, which means it&#039;s a piece of shit not worth watching even if you love Doga Kobo.

    Japan loves their maids and it’s not too hard to see why. In their world, maids are much more than just eye candy but portrayed as individuals who treats others with respect, dignity, and care. In the Western world, people will probably see maids differently. Watching Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru brings out an absurd side of the maid culture that I didn’t realize I wanted.<br />
<br />
Also known as “Our Maid is Way too Annoying”, the show doesn’t intend to hide its intentions from the very start. The first few episodes immediately sets off some red flags as we meet Tsubame Kaomi. She’s a former JSDF

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296361">
        fighter pilot and now serves a young girl named Misha Takanashi. In no less than a single episode, we discover Tsubame’s unhealthy obsession towards Misha. At every chance, she tries to initiate some intimate moment between them. The teases ranges from sneaking into baths, proposing marriage, and always trying to be at the same place. It’s the type of humor that can make or break for the viewers.<br />
<br />
Because let’s face it, this show’s plot is more of a deconstruction of the maid culture. In real life, maids wouldn’t ever behave in the way that Tsubame does. However, this anime made it clear that Tsubame genuinely cares about Misha’s well-being. From many instances, she comes to her aid when the young girl needs it the most. On the other hand, Misha begins to accept Tsubame more and more despite responding in a tsundere fashion. I should point out that Tsubame definitely leaves hair-raising moments for Misha and it’s not easy to accept her as a maid. Tsubame’s actions speaks louder than words whenever she shows affection towards her. This also extends to another character later on in the show named Midori. The catch is that Midori’s affections are pointed at Tsubame while the latter seems indifferent about them. Amusement ensues.<br />
<br />
Yet despite the reception, this anime can be entertaining to watch when you get attached to the character chemistry between Misha and Tsubame. That is, you’d have to accept them as a pair from the start. There’s no overwhelming character development for either character but it’s shown that they grow to care more and more about each other with every passing episode. There’s also a variety of humorous gags used as comedy stands out as one of the main selling points. It’s pretty cartoonish most of the times that even feels like black comedy. I’m not going to lie, Tsubame’s obsession sometimes borderlines on pedophilic tendencies. Although the show doesn’t really step foot into such category, some of the humor can really be exaggerated. On the other hand, you could definitely watch this show with the intention of absorbing the humor. A lot of it is played for laughs that does what it intends to do: show the audience a different side of maid behavior in Japan. The show is just so damn playful that it’s impossible not to laugh once or twice every episode.<br />
<br />
While the plot feels almost nonexistent, there’s some actual characterization with the main characters. The background stories of Tsubame and Midori are explored in details that makes us understand where they came from. The same can be applied to Misha although it’s shown in less vivid details. But honestly, don’t jump into this show with the intention of some interesting plot. The storytelling is mediocre at best and a poorly executed joke at worst. It’s the type of plot that adheres to comedic misadventures with almost every episode being a story of its own. This even extends to Misha’s life at school as she hangs out with her friends. Self-proclaimed rival Yui Morikawa also brings in some oddball drama based on her own perceptions. But seriously, don’t try to invest yourself into this show’s plot.<br />
<br />
Doga Kobo’s track record with slice of life content have relatively been regarded as safe and fluffy. Some of their anime also associates with shoujo-ai and it’s not hard witness those moments. This show actually jumps a bit over itself compared to their other works so I was surprised they would take such a project. The 4-koma itself also contains the absurd humor. Not to mention, the character designs are portrayed with care to make the maids look larger than life. Tsubame is a character that no one can take eyes off of whether it’s her personality, stylish maid outfit, or having a ripped body that few can match. This is a sharp contrast to Misha who wants to be as normal as possible as a child. On most parts, the show maintains a balanced art style although the comedy segments can go over the top at times. Character expressions often jumps overboard and the easiest finger to point at is Tsubame. Her affections are shown through the way she blushes and expressing her undying love in the most absurd of ways. The same can be applied to Midori towards Tsubame so you’d better get used to it. I should also point out that Tsubame’s VA did a flawless job at portraying her character. Sure, she’s not a realistic maid to accept but one that definitely gets the job done when it comes to selling her personality.<br />
<br />
It’s not an easy show to recommend but that’s ok. When I first decided to watch this series, I had no intention of expecting anything groundbreaking considering its premise and style. It took me perhaps more than half the show to truly accept what this series is capable of. Don’t get me wrong though. Once I embraced the humor, it became a show that I didn’t realize I wanted. This all depends on how you commit to this series as you can easily quote a line or two after watching. But for me, I want to watch more annoying maids doing annoying things.

    Well... i tried this show just to the try, expecting nothing and even then, well, dropped, for two good reasons, i think pervs some times are kind of funny, even in the most incomprehensible way, other most ilogical way to show this behavior, the perv is sometimes even necesary fot the story.<br />
<br />
Im not aganist the pedo IN THE ANIME (just in anime, real-life pedos are dangerous persons) also, sometimes im a bit of a lolicon, and apreciate the beauty of a little anime girl, or even a little anime boy....<br />
<br />
when i seen the cover of this title, i get atracted by the blond, green eyed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293824">
        Rusian loli and actually picked mi atention. The first episode wasa nut in the gut, i found the muscled women kind of displeasing, and the caracter was obviously masculine (i think the produces didnt allow to go with butler instead of maid)BUT i tough again, lets wait, its not total shit, it seems like there is a past in this mess, and then, i endured (because thats what i did) the ridiculous amount of molesting, the lack of common sense, and the completely asshole maid for an entire episode.Lets make some clarifications... im not a progresist, but for the sake of god, that was horrible, the half-brain father who leaves the child in hands of someone clearly dangerous, the lack of comon sense in the maid was faraway from the line that marks afection and sexual abuse, and lack of sensitivity to not to be a nuisance...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#039;m not interested in anyone who already had his first period&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait.... WTF? lets be clear, since inocence is a great present from heaven given to the children, its inocence that makes them wonderful, loveable, and put inside everyone of us some kind of protection instinc that makes us preserve their smiles, its ok to feel like that.... BUT, when you are becoming a sexual harraser, who openly admits that you are sexually atracted to children, and start saying things like that, better get the fuck of the children, search for help, and do not touch them. I understand that this is an anime caracter and no-child has been harmed, but its the caracter itself that makes me cringe, because the show happens as if those toughs are nothing, and this kind of behavior is normal and everyting is fine with begin like that...THAT IS NOT OK<br />
<br />
While the second and third episodes were actually fine, (the got deeper into the story and relationship, the espeectator become to understand more of the caracters, etc...) and i actually thought that they were geting the best part of the show.... <br />
<br />
how wrong i was... after the 4th episode, the show fall into more sexual harrasment, more spine-chilling behavior (they add a new caracter in 6th episode) perversion badly presented and threated in the show, and behind a &quot;everithing its ok&quot; smoke screen the caracters actually are talking of adult thing (SERIOUSLY ADULT THINGS) in front of grade school girls. <br />
<br />
The show is dangerous, do not touch it<br />

    I think perverts in anime can be funny.<br />
<br />
I understand some people don&#039;t share that sentiment, but there have been a decent amount of characters in anime that do it right. From the sensei who teaches his young boy students martial arts while trying to avoid showing his excessive perversion to women when said boys are around (and slips most of the time leading to funny moments of the boys being either confused or judgemental). To the eccentric mangaka-sensei who has adult female students and asks for &quot;references&quot; for his drawings. To the dirty teenage female student who wants to liberate a dystopian future which has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293264">
        banned all porn and perverted jokes and words. To the group of boys who attend an all-girls school and who get sent to the school&#039;s personal prison in fear of their boyish charms rubbing off on everyone. To the man who&#039;s entire premise is wanting to bang a female hamster, with sadly hilarious moments of inner-turmoil and bizarre reactions.<br />
<br />
Yessir, I like &#039;em all. While it is wrong to actually perv on people in real life, watching said acts done in a variety of ways may be entertaining to watch; not necessarily cause you sympathize with those jerks or you find the idea of perversion to be justified, but because they have actions and traits that define them more dominantly, have limits on how far they go with their perversion, or have the sh*t kicked out of them for some well-served justice.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I think Uchi no Maid does perversion in the wrong way.<br />
<br />
The pervert is an adult women, perving on a child, who has no say in the matter and has no way of fighting back or escaping her; and while at first it might seem that the maid&#039;s affections are purely those of a woman doting on a cute little Russian girl, you&#039;ll find out quick that&#039;s not the case. Woman&#039;s thirsty AF, yo. She constantly asks the kid to marry her, while she tries to see her naked or kidnaps her on trips in attempts to bond and spend time with her. Lady tries to incorporate most of her time tormenting the kid with her presence and lack of understanding of personal space. It doesn&#039;t come off as the least bit charming or endearing, I just wanted her to leave the poor kid alone. Doesn&#039;t help that the dad that hired that woman never gets his own daughter&#039;s message that this woman literally wants her as her child bride.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t matter how much depth and traits they give the lady later on with having the child feel sympathetic to her or having sad music play when she reveals about her troubled past as a war veteran. She still has no concept of personal space or the word &quot;No&quot; given by a kid who&#039;s probably not gay and who&#039;s not interested in a bulky woman-handling.<br />
<br />
The child though, that&#039;s the best thing this series has going for it. Her attitude, her interactions with her friends, her pets, her interests and hobbies, it&#039;s all funny and cute. Had the show taken a different angle to this girl&#039;s life without having the annoying maid be the catalyst to her personal development, this show could have been fun to watch overall.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m doubtful this show will not go any other way but having the maid become the most sympathetic and understanding character by the end of the series, and that would mean the child she harassed would grow to like her. For now, I&#039;ll continue to watch this poor kid get tormented and HOPEFULLY never succumb to the maid&#039;s pervy ways, cause that part of the show is kinda funny. I’m hoping, however, that this show&#039;s idea of developing this maid to become liked by the child will not become a reality by the end, otherwise this sticks to being a horrible example of perversion in anime.<br />

    If you talk about controversy surrounding this season and the subject is not Goblin Slayer then you are probably talking about this anime. The set-up is straight up uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
Tsubame wants to get a new job after working in the air-force and comes across the house of Misha. After her mother died Misha became an enormous brat and a neet who terrorised all her maids. Then Tsubame becomes the maid of her and Misha is ready to terrorize her too. That doesn&#039;t happen, instead it happens vice versa. Tsubame is an enormous female lolicon and she took this job just to care for this cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292642">
        russian girl. Misha, ofcourse, doesn&#039;t like it and now she has to survive in the hands of this lolicon maid. <br />
<br />
It is Obvious why this anime has controversy surrounding it: A series about the practises of an lolicon is not particular comfortable for many (I hope), so people rightfully so point that out. So here is my take on it: The lolicon stuff is heavily implied and joked about, but never really practised. There is no disgusting fanservice like in Eromanga Sensei. The closest thing you are gonna get to that are the abs of Tsubame and those abs makes you want to stay more then leave. Second, <br />
<br />
So in short: While the implications are uncomfortable, it isn&#039;t that uncomfortable when you think about it.<br />
<br />
So what&#039;s beyond the story? (oh yeah the story is a 7/10)  <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
While the later episodes have nice animation it doesn&#039;t compare to episode 1. Holy smokes the animation is amazing. Sakuga is abused like my little sister and it looks amazing. The expressions are hilarious, the visual gags are fun and the artstyle is just pleasant.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
...mwah it is serviceable. I like the russian music and the opening and ending aren&#039;t too shaby. Nothing great, nothing bad.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
Tsubame is just great. She is an extreme lolicon and she doesn&#039;t try to hide it, but she also is really ripped with amazing. She can also be really dependable at times like a true mother, which is a great contrast to her lolicon traits.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Even if I felt uncomfortable at times, the humor is just way to good to stay uncomfortable. There is so many good jokes in this anime and the comedic timing is just exceptional. Even the more heavy stuff succeeded to leave an impact on me. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
Yeah I know I talked about the lolicon themes a tiny bit too much, but I think that was the most important thing to adress. This anime can be uncomfortable, but if you look past that you have an amazing anime with great humor and great animation.<br />

    At first looking at this anime, i thought it was another generic maid genre anime with bit of comedy added to it. Boy i was proven wrong. <br />
So what do you get when you put in a introvert shut in Russian Loli and a hardcore Military retired Maid with a ripped body (and i mean really ripped) who is a hardcore lolicon together? A total Blast of slap stick comedy filled with lolicon moments and scenarios and i mean in a really enjoyable way including good touching and emotional moments in between.<br />
<br />
The Show basically revolves around Misha (the loli) who has started being a shut

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296389">
        in and introvert due to her mothers recent demise and given upon a normal life. As her father yasuhiro is mostly busy with work and wants someone to take care of the house and Misha, he hires for help, and enters our Lady Tsubame the ex-military officer who applies as a maid and damn she is the very definition of lolicon, assaulting on Misha everyday with her undying love for her through various ways like preparing delicious food and trying to help her in some other ways , and misha obviously revolted  with tsubame&#039;s lolicon fetish trying to escape her antics but sometimes falling for her  tricks such as her cooking and getting surprised by Tsubame&#039;s Military prowess and techniques all presented in a really good comical manner.<br />
There are also funny moments where there are lines and scenarios which might make it awkward or a bit uncomfortable but if you really have a high tolerance of comedy you will really enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The Best part of this series in my opinion is its not all rainbows and sunshine, because they add some really good, relatable emotional and touching scenes for example misha&#039;s memories with her mother , and her current personality due to her mothers death, and the viewers can really feel the emotion of the moment, but the flow of the story is so good that when the scene continues and it goes into lighter and comical moments quickly the viewers can enjoy the rest of the entire episode too and also indulge and savor the emotional part of the episode as well, which made me  hooked on to this series. <br />
The last Episode just proves that and was done really well. <br />
<br />
Talking about Art, Doga Kobo works usually are one of the best. The animation is really good, the expressions, and the flow of it is top notch. Detailed drawing like Tsubame&#039;s weird but funny lolicon imaginations and Presenting her Ripped toned body which brings out her manly side in a funny way for the viewers and other aspects of the story which the audience will notice when they watch the series.<br />
<br />
As for the Sound, Haruka Shiraishi the VA for Misha and Manami Numakura the VA for Tsubame have done an amazing job for the characters, The op &quot;Uzauza☆Waosu!&quot; and the End &quot;Tokimeki Climax&quot;  are both sung by the VA&#039;s. <br />
&quot;Tokimeki Climax&quot; being my favorite which is sung from Tsubame&#039;s perspective is  too good , its really catchy and enjoyable to hear and watch. :D<br />
<br />
Character wise Tsubame is really my favorite, She has a multi talented character development, where she is a high classed trained individual but succumbs to her love of little girls especially misha and totally loses it at times, but is totally dependable, mature and sometimes a mother like figure totally a  refreshing sight for a female Mc. <br />
Misha is also really good with her cute, shy , introvert and her inner gamer personality which some people can relate to. She can be really funny while reacting to tsubame&#039;s advance and tactics and her reactions are priceless.<br />
<br />
In the end i would say if you are looking for a story or a anime with a powerful hidden message or story , then no this isn&#039;t something you should watch, But for a good  refreshing slice of comedy with   the element of lolicon, weird, cringey comedy (in a good way) and a bit of emotional, serious moments, which people who like humor will enjoy and to sit, back relax &amp; be entertained then yes this really a recommended watch .

    This anime is morbid, yes there is no fan service or things like that but the humor is seedy<br />
More you watch more it&#039;s become disturbing...<br />
Yes lolis are cute, I am also a lolicon sometimes... but the maid should be in prison,..<br />
It&#039;s not disturbing when they are pervets in anime, that can be funny but here the jokes are really morbid..<br />

On the 2-3 we have character development<br />

In addition, the characters are awful, the loli is just a loli and she is the only reasonable character of the story, <br />
the maid is a

    Tsubame! You pedophile. What the hell Tsubame (the maid) is so obsessed with Misha. Like it’s literally so creepy. And she says I lose interest when a girl gets their period. That’s plain creepy.<br />
 But other than than Tsubame’s pedophilic side I think she’s a hard working person. She told the truth about her mother but still I don’t like her. If I was in Misha’s place I would be scared too so I don’t blame her for being scared of Tsubame like she literally followed Misha around and was thinking to get married with Misha.<br />
I think that’s illegal Tsubame. :/

    Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru is a pretty good anime, I have to say I overall enjoy it, mostly because it not only focuses on the character development, but its side characters too. I like Misha and Tsubame&#039;s relationship because Tsubame sometimes feels like a mother figure to Misha, and sometimes it&#039;s just plain lolicon comedy I never fail to laugh at. I&#039;m eager to see how this will turn out, but it&#039;s definitely my favorite anime of the season.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
<br />
For a plain comedy, this anime has its contrast between being hilarious and sometimes even serious, although Tsubame&#039;s lolicon-like attitude can sometimes get repetitive and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292741">
        a little over the top. <br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
<br />
The art is pretty decent, artstyle seems pretty good, it&#039;s moe and I like that. I still can&#039;t believe how the animators coped with Tsubame&#039;s overly athletic figure, I admire them for that. <br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not overreacting here, both opening and ending songs got stuck in my head over only one episode, and the ED easily became my favorite song.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
<br />
Just like I said, I like how the anime portrays Tsubame as a mother figure, and a lolicon at the same time, it gives the show a unique feel, seeing how the two react to eachother. It&#039;s just hilarious.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
<br />
I recommend this, even if it&#039;s not finished yet, it&#039;s worth the wait because it&#039;ll never disappoint you, then again it just depends on what kind of person you are so no promises! :D<br />
<br />

    Excuse me, but what is wrong with you Japan? This is one of the worst animes I&#039;ve ever seen and I only watched 4 episodes before quitting.<br />
<br />
I can talk about the non-existent story (which is expected in slice of life animes) or the mediocre sound design, but that isn&#039;t what the biggest problem is with this anime: the characters. Misha, the little girl is cute and interesting, she also has to deal with a personal trauma (which I won&#039;t spoil), so there is no problem here. Tsubame, the maid on the other hand is a full blown pedophile. She isn&#039;t a lolicon as the trailer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307258">
        suggested, she is sexually attracted to little girls and that is funny I guess? Misha&#039;s father, Yasuhiro is a very bad parent who doesn&#039;t even realize that the maid is a sexual predator. The first 2 episodes were about how Misha is trying to avoid Tsubame at all costs. In the later episodes there are no further character development, just more bad jokes and kid harrassment. I could not recommend this anime to anyone, unless you are a total creep. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m all for lolicon jokes in anime, but this anime is disgusting and wrong on so many levels, so that is why I gave this bad score to it.

    I quite enjoyed this show at first, it was right up my alley. Cute characters, funny and overall no real story. Just the type of show I would enjoy. However, it quickly became a boring mess. The jokes got really repetitive and it turned into a chore to watch after about 5/6 episodes. The characters lost their appeal and it started to take multiple sittings to get through an episode. <br />
<br />
What little soundtrack there was, was pretty bad. I don&#039;t usually take much notice of soundtracks, but this show was so quiet. It was just voice acting a lot of the time without any music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296409">
        to go with it. Just complete silence at times. What little music that actually was added was extremely simple. Yeah shows like these don&#039;t usually need a solid soundtrack to go along with it, but a good ost will really bring out the enjoyment of the show. It was disappointing to see wasted potential<br />
<br />
Apart from that, it was cute and colourful. Overall i wouldn&#039;t recommend people to watch this. There are much nicer slice of life shows out there to spend your time on.

    This was in one way or another, one of the most, if not, intriguing series we had in quite sometime. We all know Japan has the insane fetish about maids, and this series is no different in its portrayal and premise. So...when this first aired, many people had doubts about how far were its initial premise pitch than the actual anime, that turned people off. And I assure you, THAT premise is accurate and true to the word: a pedophile lolicon maid who eyes for the little girl&#039;s every action, trying to capture her worth.<br />
<br />
The story starts off on a sad note that our dear

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296382">
        titular character Misha Takanashi, a young 2nd grader Jap-Russo mix blood, has to live her growing-up years without her mum whom passed away (for a reason). It is with that reason that her father, Yasuhiro, has a job offer in the form of a maid to help cover his busyness to housekeep (or babysit) Misha...and that job lands on the irritating Tsubame Kamoi, a former JSDF (Air) commander-cum-officer, who has a fetish for lolis, and always activates the red flag whenever she gets too cocky for getting too close with Misha, whether in flesh or in cosplay (e.g. the old lady and her dog). And let the homewrecker dark comedy games begin!!!<br />
<br />
On the same way though, it is not without some friends (and literal pets dogs) that both Misha and Kamoi have relationships with. Her close friend Washizaki (or Washiwashi as Misha calls her for easy remembrance), is a friend that helps accompany her throughout her school and outside life, or rather I&#039;ll say, is being used by Misha herself to escape the &quot;clutches&quot; of Kamoi (but fails each and everytime). But Washiwashi for the most part serves as Misha&#039;s encouragement and as an easy-to-relate friend that is alienated from typical people (mostly due to her standout hair colour). And the rival Yui Morikawa, for some insane reason is the atypical standout of the class of both Washizaki and Misha in terms of being famous and whatnot, and I always find it hilarious that despite her efforts, Misha&#039;s status as the foreigner always manages to beat her always. Not leaving out Kamoi, her next-in-line commander Midori is kinda of a strange subset too, as both her and (former) Kamoi were commanders of the K9 section, but what sets them apart is with that fear, comes discipline and respect...and it&#039;s the same coalition that Midori is infatuated with Kamoi (Shoujo Ai again...), and Misha the Clumsy always gets in Kamoi&#039;s way, making for some funny scenes.<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s something sorely lacking, it&#039;s the overall presentation that gets repetitive and boredom can set in by the umpteenth time that the same reactions can be predicted very well and that makes for watch-ability passing it up. But here&#039;s my point of why I think this is good. Despite repetitiveness, it&#039;s just as funny to expect and receive good (or even better) jokes between the interactions of (mostly) Kamoi and Misha, so much so that the weariness of watching episode after episode doesn&#039;t feel as bad as it should be.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the studio of choice (largely CGDC(razy)T, of which this can be debatable if this is/ain&#039;t), Doga Kobo is always the go-to studio as they have a great track record of CGDCT shows. Even as a seasonal viewer, it&#039;s safe to say that their art and animation has always been consistently great, no foreshadowing what will happen, and that constant backup of the great use of visuals and such. A job well done as always, and would like to see more.<br />
<br />
The music really is something else. Let&#039;s talk about the OST 1st, as it was as generic as any other shows out there, if not decent. I find it mildly good to be honest, although that OP was as energetic as the character themselves. The reason for the season is always the background music (or rather the largely repetitive standout fear-sounding SFX that Misha will always get shudders from when Kamoi set her sights on her) that always made me chuckle laughs out for any kind of insane proposition.<br />
<br />
To love this series, you&#039;d have a mindset of knowing what you&#039;re in for (other than the subjective dark comedy), and then put your expectation level on low settings, and just enter into it. This anime is not for everyone, but for whatever reasons, comedy is the main source that will get you through this. Maids for more glory!

    *no spoilers ahead*<br />
There&#039;s not much that can be said about this show, as there is very little of substance. At the core of it though, this is just another poke at the wide valley of mediocrity. So, here we go, starting off with the good first:<br />
<br />
The art, music and voice acting are pretty good (although they REALLY overuse the horror music track). Overall feel is pretty decent too. That is all. Now, the bad.. And there&#039;s way more of it BUT... Its still not enough to make the show bad, although definitely enough to not make it good.<br />
<br />
Lack of story. This can&#039;t be stated hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296253">
        enough, there&#039;s literally nothing there. Now then, that in itself is not always a bad thing, plenty of comedies pull it off pretty well with even less than this show does, the way this one is structured simply does not allow it to. Mainly, until about the half point, there&#039;s just two main characters in the show, with two more side characters that have very little screen time. Then a third more or less main character shows up, as well as another side character and it does make it a bit better, but still, without intense comedy and no story, the overall entertainment value and engagement is quite low.<br />
<br />
Since i just touched on comedy, i&#039;ll get back to it again - yes, there&#039;s very little of it. Or rather there&#039;s very few jokes that actually hit hard. They&#039;re still there, in fact when it works it can be pretty good, but for the majority of the time it isn&#039;t, usually being light humor, with the jokes being too flat, stretched, or the disturbing nature of the main character (maid A) taking away from it. Speaking of, this is probably the biggest, and worse point of this anime - its disturbing nature. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, perversion and lolicon can be hilarious in anime, and in fact it USUALLY is, but definitely not here. And what separates this from how it usually is you ask? <br />
<br />
Context. In most shows the stuff is a passing or recurring joke that shows up here and there. Here its the WHOLE PREMISE! The story goes like this - a shy Russian-Japanese loli (named Misha, although that&#039;s a MALE&#039;S name in Russian, so go figure) who lost her mother and has only an overworked father to support her, becomes difficult due to this and also becomes a shut in. The father hires a maid (a new one, the girl chased all the previous ones away) to take care of her. She also happens to be an ex soldier, and is an extreme lolicon, and is also entirely open about it (yeah, good job there dad)! And from there on, she&#039;s hired and is always around, thus its nonstop harassment and violation of personal space, with sexual harassment, sneakiness, stalking, lying and all sorts of manipulation included, the whole package of abuse, hooray!  <br />
<br />
So yes, even if this show would be a 10/10 otherwise, this alone would take a lot of points off for me, but since it isn&#039;t.. We are where we are. Things only start getting somewhat less frequently disturbing when somewhat after the half mark the third character shows up and offloads some screen time, as well as the current situation becoming &#039;normal&#039;, but its still too little too late. Overall i&#039;d give this a solid 5, maybe a 6, but i doubt it&#039;d deserve it, after all, for a comedy, the comedy aspect is really weak (even if it does work at the start, its pretty much the same joke repeated, so it gets old and less funny extremely fast, and the creepy way its implemented and the protagonist being unable to escape it really takes away from it too, as i mentioned), and there&#039;s little else there.

    Short spoiler free review:<br />
Do you like lolis? Do you like little russian girls? Are you a pedophile?<br />
If you answered yes to one or more of the questions above, well then this anime is for you!<br />
Sometimes its animes like these that actually make me wonder what Japan can get away with putting in an anime. The story itself is quite funny, but when I take a good second to think about it, its actually quite fucked up, but that doesnt make the anime any less enjoyable. The art style the anime uses for the characters is pretty generic, but it still makes the MCs cute nonetheless.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292740">
        I also enjoy the music and the soundtrack (also has some russian-like OST added in there). <br />
Overall I give it a solid 7/10. Watch it if you want some giggles and a good time. &lt;3

    This show would have benefited greatly from either being more wacky or being more grounded.  As it is, it occupies an uncanny middle ground.<br />
<br />
The story would have worked better if the maid were just clingy and overprotective.  Making her a real weirdo detracted from the suspension of disbelief.  Even if the writer wanted to keep that aspect, her lolicon fetishes should have been expressed to the audience through internal narration, rather than spoken aloud all the time.<br />
<br />
I wanted to like this show more than I did.  The animation is good.  The ending song sequence is oddly catchy.  Voice acting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321237">
        is great.  Many of the sound cues are overused, which is really distracting when you watch the series in one sitting.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of missed potential.  She could have trouble kicking old military habits and behaviors.  Keep an overly rigorous training regimen.  Have quirky military buddies interfere with her new life, rather than just the one masochist.  Could have had an episode where extended family they&#039;ve never met want to take the girl away.  Maybe some antics like Sousuke from Full Metal Panic.  One of the girl&#039;s classmates could have a military father that always ends up indirectly competing with the maid.  The dad&#039;s mother or aunt or whatever could visit and try to get rid of the maid by assigning stupidly difficult tasks to her.<br />
<br />
Whatever its faults, the show kept me watching all the way through.  So there&#039;s that.

    It&#039;s really great to see when the comedy surpasses expectations. although it is rather a controversial theme lolicon / pedophilia, I really think that in animations these themes can pass, just as a murderer or a thief can win the sympathy of the public in fiction, our heroine Kamoi can either, being a character that transits between this forbidden area saying really disgusting phrases, and a love that resembles the maternal love. The other characters are also quite caricature though complex, with feelings and reactions quite human. The anime knows when to hold you for a serious situation, when to be funny, and when to

    When you read the synopsis of the anime, you’ll surely think that this is a lolicon anime, and the show doesn’t even try to hide it, because they even confirmed it in the first episode and repeated it for the rest of it. At that point, there’s no way back and your mind will be forever tainted by this. However, if you give Uchi no Maid a better chance or if you don’t mind the pedophilic nature, you can find some things that are very funny and some of them have a certain depth.<br />
<br />
As a fan of Doga Kobo and its classics like New Game

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296434">
        and Himouto Umaru-chan, I expected some good laughs and of course yuri, despite the big elephant in the room called the questionable interaction of the maid and the Russian loli. I’ll put some spoilers from now on, so go with caution.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10):<br />
The premise is simple; a former JSDF member called Tsubame Kamoi tries to reinsert herself into civil society by being a maid, so in a snowy day, she passes by a house of a family of Russians, in where she sees a young white girl called Misha Takanashi playing in the snow with her Russian mother, Tsubame gets instantly in love with the little girl. A few years later, Misha is alone with his “father” Yasuhiro after the death of her mother and is known for driving out the maids from her house; enter Tsubame who gets hired to take care of Misha and the house. The now 8 years old girl is determined to drive out another maid to protect her feud, but Tsubame is skilled enough to keep her pursuit of little Misha while taking care of the house.<br />
<br />
In one of the most disgusting moments of the anime comes early is when Tsubame starts talking about why she’s in love with Misha, and in a flashback, she confesses that she prefers “girls who haven’t menstruated”; but for the rest of the series, it’s more focused on the interactions of the former JSDF member with the Russian girl, with the occasional stalking from the maid to the girl in the most outrageously funny ways possible, like climbing an electricity pole, or putting CCTV cameras everywhere.<br />
<br />
Unsurprisingly, it touches sensitive issues like why Misha doesn’t go to school, explaining that she gets all the attention because of her blonde hair and she feels “ashamed” of it, Tsubame explains to her in a Martin Luther King way that she shouldn’t be worried of her hair color, because sooner or later, they’ll judge Misha by the content of her character, showing a small transition from lolicon maid to lolicon maid with motherly attitudes.<br />
<br />
After Misha gets back to school, she meets Mimika Washizaki (Washiwashi from now on) who’ll be her best friend, and supposed rival Yui Morikawa who only cares about beating Misha. The group will now be entangled with the misadventures of Misha with Tsubame, who the girls have a great appreciation due to her modals and great efficiency in doing the job done.<br />
<br />
In latter episodes, another former JSDF member who goes by the name of Midori Ukai is trying to find her former comrade and crush Tsubame, Misha then finds Midorin in the dumps after doing some weird things in the neighborhood, and sensing an opportunity to finally get rid of her maid, attempts to hire Midorin, much to the chagrin of Tsubame. Despite the consistent efficiency of Midorin in all things concerning to house cleaning, she has terrifying cooking skills due to her consistent masochist tendencies.<br />
<br />
Misha, feeling now missing Tsubame’s cooking talent, attempts to rehire her by sacking Midorin, but the latter informs her that firing someone has to be done with 1 month of anticipation according to Japan’s labor laws. And in typical Uchi no Maid fashion, Misha confesses that she prefers Tsubame’s food, and the recently rehired maid records the scene for posterity.<br />
<br />
Entering the final quarter of the show, we start getting more insight on Misha and why she constantly protects the room where her late mother used to draw, and also why she acts like that with Yasuhiro, her dad. She feels alone, and when she was in her mother’s death bed, she receives a ferret who called Kumagoro as a parting gift from her mother. She also wants to have her dad constantly around her as she feels alone and explaining why she went full hikikomori after the disappearance of her mother, considering that Yasuhiro is actually self-conscious about it.<br />
<br />
Tsubame in fact, despite her hardcore lolicon tendencies towards Misha, she appreciates her a lot, sometimes taking a symbolic position as Misha’s mother by giving some advices and helping her in the most dire situations when she saver her from a bear in Hokkaido. <br />
<br />
In the final two episodes, we start to see the high chemistry between the 3 lolis, Misha, Washiwashi and Morikawa, in which the first invites the other two to a pajama party with the help of Tsubame and Midorin. However, in typical Uchi no Maid fashion, it has several chaotic moments like when they were in the bathroom, or eating, or basically every moment the three girls and the two maids are in the house. In contrast to other episodes, Washiwashi and Morikawa entered the holy grail of Misha by accident, her late mother’s studio, and Misha discovers that and gets extremely angry, so in order to provide cover to the two girls, Tsubame assumes the guilt.<br />
<br />
By “assuming” the guilt, Tsubame is trying to maintain the equilibrium that Misha has made since she came and by taking a step too far like finally explaining that her late mother is not there and won’t come back; she immediately becomes like Misha’s de facto mother. And while the maid has her owns doubts because of the semblance of her infancy, Midorin opens again Tsubame’s eyes to have that final dialogue with Her Lady. By explaining the situation, Misha confesses that she had the fear of forgetting her mother, but started to move on from that when she asks her maid to clean the former holy grail of the house.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10):<br />
What I expected from Doga Kobo, very fine details and making very cute and accurate characters. For example, Misha is drawn with the typical phenotypes of a Russian girl, very pale skin, very blond hair and with turquoise eyes; Tsubame has a more bulky type best shown with her amazing set of abs, which is unique in modern anime, but also with a rose on her right eye which doesn’t explain what happened there; Washiwashi and Morikawa keep the cute designs seen in other classic Doga Kobo animes.<br />
<br />
The animation is extremely consistent, due to the high standards of quality of the studio, it has the occasional weird frame here and there, but it’s minimal; the bright color pallet enhance the characters and the backgrounds with seemingly no effort. The animation is fluid and never stalls, with some nice detailed backgrounds, specially the house of Misha.<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10):<br />
The sound is typical Doga Kobo, very cute with the occasional variant of more dark scores, nothing too impressive, but serviceable for Uchi no Maid, loved especially the Russian tunes in several moments which they complement very smoothly the calmness of the anime. Some background sounds magnifies the comedic and stalker ambiance nature of this show.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending are sung by Misha’s and Tsubame’s seiyuus, Haruka Shiraishi and Manami Nukamura and exemplify the comedy aspects of the anime; the ending in particular is the better. Nukamura is clearly the highlight of the voice actress with acting roles in Overlord, Shirobako, Aikatsu and fellow Fall 2018 anime Release the Spyce, she proves her talent by changing smoothly between the funny and stalkish voice of the maid and the more ceremonial and serious tone that personify Tsubame easily. There’s also the talent of MAO while voice acting Midorin and getting the best of the masochist tendencies of her.<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10):<br />
There are just 6 characters overall and all of them is important in the plot of Uchi no Maid, this is in my opinion the strength of the anime:<br />
Misha Takanashi is an 8 years old girl who is a shut in since the death of her mother, she doesn’t express correctly her emotions, but in the inside, she feels lonely and wants her father Yasuhiro to be with him most of the time. Misha is also a tsundere with Tsubame, somehow justified by the questionable actions of the maid, but she also prefers to have Tsubame around, especially when it’s about cooking.<br />
<br />
Tsubame Kamoi is a 28 years old former member of the JSDF who explicitly said even when younger that she prefers “girls who haven’t menstruated”, which clearly indicates that she is a lolicon and has an obsessive crush on Misha, to the point of telling she’ll keep loving her even after having her first period. In surprising fashion, she’s very efficient in doing house chores like cleaning, washing, cooking and maintains an aura of formality and respect to hierarchy when addressing to other people. Tsubame, with her obsessiveness with little Misha, she begins to close on her to help her with problems like loneliness, extreme introversion, like her late mother did a few years ago.<br />
<br />
Midori Ukai is also a former member of the JSDF who is in love with her former comrade, Tsubame, and because the latter rejects Midorin, she enjoys being treated badly by her. In spite of this, she is also very skilled in survival due to her more than intense training in the forces, giving some interesting and funny moments on how she hates comfort and prefers the hard way.<br />
<br />
Yasuhiro is Misha’s dad and was married to her mom; he is a hard worker and doesn’t have time to be with her daughter, so he hires maids to take care of her until Misha drives the maid out of their house. He also has problems in being considered Misha’s father and he wants to have the honor.<br />
<br />
The other 2 characters are Washiwashi, Misha’s best friend and a compliment towards Misha’s cool and direct attitude, and Yui Morikawa, who is the self-proclaimed best girl in the class and Misha’s rival, but in a one-sided way. While not very well written as the other four, they clearly play a huge role in the final 2 episodes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10):<br />
I have to take out a point from here because of the obvious reason that there’s lolicon inserted in the anime, and it’s clearly explicit in the way that is presented. However, it’s clear that I have enjoyed this anime a lot, the wacky and chaotic comedy moments were extremely well made, even in the moments of higher tension, the comedy is still on point to dilute the mood a bit, even by considering the constant repetition of the lolicon “joke”, and the characters are very consistent and realistic inside this somehow unrealistic crazy comedy.<br />
<br />
If you pay attention closely to the intricate and tsundere interaction of Misha and Tsubame, you’ll start seeing it more as a mother and daughter-lite interactions which for me makes the show earn its coins despite the big problem mentioned constantly above. As a final parting word, a second season could do justice if they can manage to touch things not mentioned at all in the anime like why Morikawa acts like that, how Yasuhiro came to meet Misha and her mother, etc.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10.

    I&#039;m sorry but this is the single most disgusting show I&#039;ve ever seen, so much it made me want to write a review which I never do.<br />
<br />
It just made me super uncomfortable to watch. The show is about a literal pedophile who wants to marry a child. I don&#039;t know how this is supposed to be funny, all it is. I tried to give it a shot, but I had to take breaks every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The main loli character is fine, I actually like her as a character. The show should&#039;ve focused on her. The maid though. No. She&#039;s the issue. She makes the show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382969">
        uncomfortable to watch. She wants to marry a child, that&#039;s not ok even in anime. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t suggest that you watch this show.
