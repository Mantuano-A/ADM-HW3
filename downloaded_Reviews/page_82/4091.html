    Let me tell you a Story, a Story of a man that gets into a high school, just to find out that this school is ruled by &quot;feminism&quot;. that school was once a female school. But then they decided to open it to male population. but guess what? the nation of &quot;feminism&quot; stroke down, and the whole school turned all their male students into females boys in order to make the girls feel &quot;safe&quot;<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Overall Section<br />
<br />
if by this point you don&#039;t spot any red flags dancing around your mind, then you should stop reading (btw, if you are going to get salty, avoid my profile

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250568">
        and grow up, after all this is my opinion). but if you feel that the whole Idea is ridiculous then keep reading. be aware of spoilers<br />
<br />
Story 2/10:<br />
<br />
Story, story... What story? all we got is that Nomura got transferred into another school just to find out that the school is full on whimsical girls that for whatever reason have a problem against all men (&quot;feminism&quot;), and the school rules consist on turning boys into girls so they can get all along. (then what is the point of even including males into it?)<br />
<br />
Nomura just wanted to chill on his new school, but apparently if he doesn&#039;t agree with the shitty rules that the school has, he is forced to a fight against the &quot;5 swords&quot; or any other girl that has something against men. the whole argument of this show is a convenient plot device that serves purpose as how idiotic the high school rules can be and how low the girls fall on this show. then, if our MC wants to chill he has to defeat all the 5 swords and get a &quot;pass&quot; to leave the school.<br />
<br />
*spoiler section*<br />
<br />
sometimes we get some of the past of Nomura, he constantly remembers one of his &quot;friends&quot; that he used to hang out with... sadly the pure essence of a Yandere awakened on that friend and decided to beat the fuck out of him... guess what happens next? <br />
<br />
*End of spoiler section*<br />
<br />
Art 5/10:<br />
<br />
Your average budget for a generic setting, it was nice to see some attacks coming from some fights, as for fan service, it was a relieving distraction for the pain this show is<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10:<br />
<br />
I always wonder why good sounding OPs are to be found in generic anime, is a total waste, but it accomplishes as a relieving distraction. I don&#039;t find anything really outstanding, so overall is okay<br />
<br />
Character 2/10:<br />
<br />
Aside of how strong the feminism essence is on the girls, they are also a bunch of generic annoying girls. if you have seen this setting before, its almost obvious that every girl eventually will like the MC. well this time is more in a masochist way, they all start liking the MC after all of them received a beatdown (a really relieving beatdown I must say) so lets give them some points for showing us another way to get a Harem.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really have a problem with anime girls overall, unless they are a bunch of useless airheads (Chitanda from Hyouka for example), but this show went too far making almost every girl annoying in a way. and I&#039;m talking about that green haired girl that gets on my nerves each time that she appears, I don&#039;t know how people do like her, but I haven&#039;t seen someone that annoying. I actually wanted her to suffer a lot, (gladly she did, and it was extremely relieving) aside of the 99% of annoying girls, there is 1% that is quite acceptable, there goes Onigawara, and the Bear girl with the HIO HIO HIO laugh, but nothing more.<br />
<br />
*Spoiler section<br />
<br />
Oh yes, Give Nomura some credit for defending the male population, it was really relieving seeing how he succeeded against the  girls beating them down one by one<br />
<br />
*End of spoiler Section... actually it was obvious that he would most likely to succeed*<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10: <br />
<br />
Enjoying this show is like watching a fight on the street between someone you don&#039;t know, against someone you dislike so much, the relieving factor of seeing how that someone you don&#039;t like get beat down so hard makes you feel extremely relieved. if it were because of how Nomura beats down each girl and saves male population of becoming female boys, I would have rated this higher than 8. Sadly the &quot;blood bath&quot; ending I wanted didn&#039;t happened. not even the final moment with Onigawara. Everything turned into a cliché and bullshit plot device around Amou that no one asked (Like hey, lets make a past for the MC but lets never touch it until the very end so we create a really convenient finale). well, at least I didn&#039;t ask for it, that should be more accurate if the ones reading this are burning their salt into really high temperature ready to burst against me...<br />
<br />
Overall 3,8/10:<br />
<br />
TL;DR: school transfer ends wrong, girls trying to punish a male because he is a male that won&#039;t become a female, he fights against school rules, saving all the males from becoming females, he creates a harem, and a plot convenience comes to claim him as her unrequited love from the past because jealousy

    tl;dr: Not particularly strong in terms of plot or depth but has a good balance of cool and stylish moments as well as comedic and amusing moments with a likable cast of characters.<br />
<br />
The anime is trying to do two things, be cool and be amusing. It&#039;s not trying to have a good plot or deep characters or anything like that. There&#039;s a good variety to how both of these are done though and there&#039;s a good balance of the two, so it works well in such a way there are a lot of fun and likable characters. For example, the various main characters have a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331042">
        cool edge to them in very different ways, and they also all have strange things about them that make them hilarious in different ways, the exception to the latter being Andou who is pretty much just pure bad ass, while the best example of both of those traits is Nomura, who is an incredibly unique protagonist and is pretty much just a steady stream of great one liners, both hilarious or cool, and crazy combat potential, which is also often accompanied by one liners. Some characters do get fleshed out somewhat with backgrounds and such, and there&#039;s even some decent character and relationship development, but its not really much in the focus and mostly just serves as a basis for Nomura to drop one liners and seem awesome. The exception to that is centered around the relationship between Nomura and Andou which has some more depth to it and serve as the finale for the season, though while it is probably the coolest of the anime&#039;s arcs the story is still only okay which shouldn&#039;t be surprising as story isn&#039;t really one of the anime&#039;s strengths.<br />
<br />
A lot of why the anime is so cool is the action, which manages to be impressive in that its mostly grounded but has just a bit that goes beyond being realistic. This assertion may seem strange because all sorts of crazy stuff happens like fighting bears and because the entire setting is crazy with it being a normal school but people randomly carrying swords and getting into near death fights without getting in trouble, but with the tone and atmosphere that&#039;s what it ultimately felt like. There&#039;s also a steady stream of ability names appearing on screen with fancily stroked kanji which despite seeming dumb actually makes things feel more legitimate, though that&#039;s probably only because I don&#039;t know jack about actual swordsmanship or martial arts. So the action was cool and exciting. With that said, ultimately things did seem a bit simplistic in that each character only has one thing going for them, even Nomura who only really has one move.<br />
<br />
The art style and animation was mostly decent in that designs and framing were good and there were some great scenes, but quality felt off at times. The anime also felt kind of cheap in that there were a lot of points that it felt that it was clearly padding for time which definitely hurt pacing, especially if you&#039;re marathoning it. The eye catches were well done. The OP was great both in terms of audio and visuals. The ED was decent enough in both. The soundtrack wasn&#039;t particularly memorable.

    Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism in other term, THE SCHOOL OF FEMINISM. <br />
<br />
This show is more like a empowerment for women against all guys.<br />
<br />
This show is like a Hardcore feminism where women can actually hurt any man. But what I like about this show is that it contradicts the prejudice of every women. That not all men are enemies, and not all men are pervents. The story isn&#039;t that marvelous, but it gives justice to every man in the school. It&#039;s like winning their trust show, and you&#039;ll gonna like it. Unlike Prison School, if you&#039;re familiar with it, this show is more like showing the good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247391">
        side and clarifying the misunderstanding between men and women that they can co-exist to one another without any barrier. I like the development actually. If you are a man, you&#039;ll gonna root for the Main male character, but if you are a women, you&#039;ll be triggered because it&#039;s like they&#039;re protraying that despite how strong women are, women are fragile with their feelings, and they need the D afterall. If you know what I mean.

    If I had to describe studio Silverlink in one word, that word would be &#039;&#039;mediocre&#039;&#039;.  They&#039;re perhaps the most &quot;okay&quot; studio working in the industry today and none of their shows I would consider being all that good, with the exception of a couple maybe, but, even then, those exceptions are still nothing all too remarkable. They always make shows that sound good on paper, and, when read, sound like they could be good shows, but they usually lack the creative talents and efforts to carry this through and their shows always just end up feeling either downright terrible or just &quot;meh&quot; for lack

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250621">
        of a better term. Nowhere is this more evident than with their latest title, Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism, which, with a narrative and idea this silly, could have made for a good rule of cool show if it had more energy put into its animation, but it feels, like most of their work, that they wanted to create something really cool and cinematic looking, but didn&#039;t have the necessary talent or creative force to do so. Despite being a relatively fun show none the less, the anime needed much more charisma in order to carry itself along for the entire duration and the shows just falls short of reaching that rule-of-cool aesthetic and vibe it was so clearly aiming for. In that regard, the show feels very much like a previous Silverlink show, Chivalry of a Failed Knight, which, despite being vastly greater than most other light novel adaptations and is all around a decent show, also falls just short from being good due the studio&#039;s general lack of creativity in visuals, while, at the same time, having a decent script with decent characters, something that Busou also carries on as well. Either way, let&#039;s dive into this insane, nutty show!<br />
<br />
Busou&#039;s narrative as a whole is one that is incredibly linear and straightforward. The show will not surprise you with any grand plot twists nor does it bring anything new to the table either, and it doesn&#039;t really have much direction. What I mean by that is that the characters don&#039;t really have anything in the way of a &#039;goal&#039; or a motivation in the narrative, other than the main character wanting to collect five stamps from a group of five girls, all of whom carry swords. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yes, for some reason, the school has allowed each one of the girls to carry a weapon due to the once all girl&#039;s school, becoming co-ed, allowing boys to join and, out of fear, request to carry said weapons as a means of protecting themselves. These weapons range anywhere from a sword to a whip to even a giant, damn bear! This aspect of the show is incredibly stupid, but the show as a whole is so tongue in cheek and takes itself so lightly that this aspect feels like a part of the world that is presented to us and doesn&#039;t feel all too jarring or even strange. Since the show doesn&#039;t take itself so seriously and more so laughs at its ridiculous setup, I can excuse this obvious dumb stuff. Due to each one of the girl&#039;s weapons, and general scary nature, the boys who do attend this school are put to humiliation and are forced to wear girl&#039;s clothing as a way to blend in with the school.  Enter our main character, a cocky, bad-ass asshole, by the name of Nomura, who goes against the demands of the girl&#039;s at the school, and the rest of the show sees him fight against five girls, who are called the Five Swords, a group who are the strongest, and most skilled with the sword, who go around correcting problematic students and the such. And that&#039;s about it for an overall plot, but the show carries this narrative with such a silly over the top atmosphere and tone, that I find it a lot of fun to watch the battles carry out and the characters feel dynamic and interesting enough in personality to carry the weight of the show.<br />
<br />
The anime is incredibly dumb and stupid in a lot of ways, from sumo wrestling a giant bear to the plethora of various battles and fights, but, at the same time, the show also feels self-aware enough to know that the entire thing is incredibly dumb, and fully embraces all of it. Whenever the characters are in battle, bold white text will appear on the screen showcasing the name of their attacks, akin to something like Kill la Kill, with plenty of close-up shots of the characters reacting to certain events while they gasp. Both of these elements help to sell the show&#039;s rule of cool vibe it is aiming for and helps to make it fun and fairly entertaining for me personally. However, there are some moments in the show that I feel are a little too stupid for its own good. One such example is when the main character is attempting to hide behind a bear, a pet of one of the members of the Five Swords, which also happens to be female, as he accidentally touches her breasts. Instead of being funny, which is what I believe the writer was attempting, it just comes across as being strange, jarring and uncomfortable to watch as well.  Another example that may put some people off is when he fights one of the girls naked in the bathing areas. It can be distracting, and some may even consider tasteless, but I found the fight fun enough to carry the scene, and the nakedness of the girl is part of her tactic for winning the fight and adds on a little bit of characterisation for her character. Some other criticisms about the show may stem from the amount of blood and edge the show does try and convey, especially near the end, and I can understand why. It can seem kind of jarring to go from simply hi-jinks to a complete bloodbath as shown in episode ten, but, on the flip side, at the very least it provides some narrative stakes for the final fight and makes the villain out to be much more menacing and threatening too. The use of blood never really came across to me as being forced since it at least made sense in the context of the battles since all of the characters were using razor sharp blades. Another troupe that I wasn&#039;t too fond of, is that two of the girls fall in love with our main character and end up acting catty and bitchy to each other as they fight over him. I&#039;ve always disliked this in anime since it reduces the female characters as nothing more than petty women, but here it didn&#039;t feel as bad as what I have seen before, and for the most part, there is an actual reason why these girls have fallen for this guy, as opposed to them simply wanting the main guy&#039;s dick just because the plot demands them to. This doesn&#039;t make this element any better, just a little bit more bearable in the long run.<br />
<br />
I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed the show and found myself actually excited and immersed during the action scenes, especially during the final fight. The series is so over the top and so dumb that I believe it does work from an entertainment standpoint alone, and while I wouldn&#039;t consider the entire narrative and characters to be terrible, it certainly needed a lot more work to make the show good.<br />
<br />
Each one of the characters has a stupid obvious gimmick whether that be in design or personality, but, at the very least, many of the characters at least have some depth, no matter how little granted, to make them feel a little more like actual people than bland archetypes. The main lead, Mamoru is essentially a better version of Glenn from Akashic Records, in that he is far more consistent and does the whole bad-ass cocky bastard rather well. I genuinely liked this character, and his back-story, unlike Glenn didn&#039;t feel as if it were included just for the sake of evoking cheap emotion from the audience, despite how generic and by the numbers this back-story actually is and how little of it we actually get to learn. A character like this holds up well for a silly narrative since he simply a lot of fun to watch and complements the silly nature of the show, although I wouldn&#039;t call his character good by any stretch. He fills his purpose fairly well, has some decent comedic moments and is a fine character. Rin&#039;s character has a massive hatred of men and wears a death god mask over half of her face since her mother called her ugly when she was a child and made her wear a mask over her face at all times when she went out with her. This back-story is quite dumb and rather, again, silly, but at the very least it provides an explanation into why this character acts the way that she does and the purpose behind her mask, rather than it remain a silly gimmick like those presented in Hand Shakers for example. Mary was a lot more generic than these two previously mentioned since we barely learn anything about her past and just assumes the &quot;girl with big boobs&quot; role while also carrying around a dictionary since she is Le François. She can be pretty annoying due to her attitude and general stuck-up-edness (that&#039;s not a word, I know) but otherwise, she is pretty forgettable. One of my favourite characters in the show is Satori, not only for how well her voice actress conveys her messed up mentality and rather sadistic sword fighting but because there was a decently executed plot twist in episode nine. It&#039;s not something to blow your mind, but I felt it was a decent twist none the less, and I did enjoy every scene she was in. While she doesn&#039;t necessarily see much development (as does the rest of the cast) she still gets some decent characterisation. The other two members of the Five Swords,  Warabi and Tsukyo, were also likeable, and Tsukyou especially manages to pull off the strong swordsman character rather effectively, and that&#039;s one thing I can praise the show for. The main character, while very strong, still isn&#039;t able to blow through all of the girls with ease and finds himself cornered more often than not, having to think up some clever way to win. While this isn&#039;t on the same level of tactical fights I&#039;ve seen in some other shows, it at the very least, creates some narrative tension and stakes and makes the girl characters feel more like fighters than in your typical light novel series where the girls are all presented as being weak without the help of the boring male self-insert character. The final villain was decently executed and I felt a genuine sent of excitement seeing the main character and her fight in the final episodes, with a decently explored back-story explaining their rivalry and the reason why it spawned in the first place giving more weight to the scene. The character interactions were fine but often the dialogue feels very simple and trite, with two characters just yelling how great they are, and sometimes the comedy between certain characters could fall flat on its face. <br />
<br />
The animation consistency was fairly good with a lot of character movement and attacks but the art consistency took a large hit as a result of this. It&#039;s good enough in conveying the action on screen and some moments can look downright great, but overall it&#039;s just fine. I liked the character designs themselves and the general colour design too, and the opening is catchy as hell! While in terms of visuals, it&#039;s just a bunch of random fights, each one flows into each other fairly well. The music is fine and does its job but is ultimately rather forgettable once you&#039;ve finished watching the show; nothing all too remarkable aside from the opening and ending tracks. Overall, I believe this anime did achieve what it set out to do to a certain extent. While it is an overall decent show, I would be lying if I said that I didn&#039;t have fun watching this show and I would recommend this anime for anyone looking for a dumb, easy ride, although I doubt this show will be remembered in a few months.<br />

    Let me tell you all a story.. &quot; once there was a delinquent boy.. who got expelled from school and had to join a new school which was being dominated by girls and they all wanted to straighten him up but ended up falling for him... THE END&quot;. Ever heard of something like this.. ya i know . So this pretty much sums up the entire anime and almost  very other harem anime nowadays.This show here is nothing but a sorry excuse of a harem anime with almost no originality and is full of shitty cliches that would make no sense. You would rather

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250538">
        wonder about why are the children even allowed use swords and whips in school .<br />
<br />
Armed Girl&#039;s Machiavellism is anime based on the manga of same name and is made by LINDElFILMS. Now the studio is known for making some great harem like  Yamada kun and the seven withes but TBH even i am not sure why they would make such anime anime now. The story follows Fudo Nomura, strong delinquent who was expelled from his school for engaging in a fight where he defeated almost 40 people, and now he studies at Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy which is ruled by a group of girls called &#039;Supreme 5 Swords&quot; whose mission is to correct out all the boys after the school became co-ed.He is really skilled when it comes to fighting and has a lot of knowledge about various martial art styles. He even has his own orignal technique called &quot; Magic Bullet&quot; through which he can defeat almost anyone with just a  single touch. All the members of supreme swords wanted to defeat Nomura but instead ended up defeated and for some reason they all fell for him (don&#039;t ask me why).<br />
<br />
Now , the protagonist might be the only character who is somewhat bearable in the entire show. Almost every girl presents a pretty bad impression and their is personalities are also unbearable at some points. Rin, who is the leader of the group, fought against Nomura and somehow accidentally ended up kissing him and later on developing a crush on him. Their interaction in the beginning seemed promising but later on she turned out to be violent girl with a tsundere personality. And  introducing girls like tamaba, warabi and tsukuyo just shows how they threw up almost all the generic character tropes in the show without any proper sense.<br />
<br />
Another major character in the show is the Empress also known as Amo. At start of the series she was shown to be the strongest delinquent in the school who even the  supreme swords couldn&#039;t handle . She had a extremely violent bitch like personality who would kill anyone for almost no reason. But later it was revealed that she was in love with nomura and was a yandere personality and would kill anyone who would come between them... even Nomura .<br />
<br />
Now i would praise the anime for doing a good job when it came to martial arts. They did well in explaining the techniques and  arts used in show and the fights seemed to make some sense. But hey! an anime where even a bear does martial arts.. now that might be something you Have to see.<br />
<br />
Now after watching the entire series the only question which came in my mind was.. Just why. Why even create such a thing ? watching this made me feel that the creators were not even sure where they were going with this thing. They just threw up almost everything  that came in their mind with worrying about it making even a bit of sense. There is no memorable character or dialogue whatsoever and most of the characters are almost unbearable to watch. The setting is also nothing special, just a  simple High school where for some reason everything including swords, whips, bears , blades are totally allowed but a boy wanting to enjoy his freedom is not.<br />
<br />
Now THB there&#039;s nothing much to say about the art . It might as well be the only good thing in the anime. The character design is also pretty generic with nothing to praise or complain about. The sound track is also pretty good, The op Builds up some hype for a good fast paced hardcore action anime.... which unfortunately this  show is not. The battle music is nothing good or original either but fits there anyways.<br />
<br />
Now in the end... this show is nothing good . Its not exactly really bad either and you might even find it decent if you are a fan of such kind of shows but I can&#039;t bring myself to like this show. There is no originality or even a good plot. The characters are just generic and boring , and their interactions also felt somewhat cheesy and the jokes don&#039;t do much either. So I would not really recommend this show to everyone, but you can still watch it to find if it really is all that bad as I said it is. And ya... why are  the swords allowed in the school?<br />

    Huh? girls with weapons? ruling over boys? and tsundere characters? meh nothing uncommon right?<br />
its an anime series with quite a lot of &quot;pain&quot; and some cute~ moments a pervert like myself can enjoy.<br />
i firstly wrote my review for this anime the day when fourth episode was released, and there was nothing interesting going on by that time.<br />
After watching the rest of the episodes i changed both my score and my opinion about it.<br />
<br />
Having almost finished the series i can say that, it has a common &quot;revenge&quot; -ish story, which i believe will end in a really silly way.<br />
The MC is not that typical useless, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246364">
        scaredy cat pervert that we are used to having in these kind of anime series (THAT DOESN&#039;T MEAN HE IS NOT A PERVERT)<br />
but he is a gentleman most of the time.<br />
There is a comedy going on almost every single episode, except the last 2-3 episodes, where things get pretty gloomy and &quot;dangerous&quot;, the whole series might seem pretty dumb and without any goal at the beginning, but it unfolds slowly with some hints midways giving you a reason our MC is doing what he is doing. <br />
<br />
I am pretty sure that you&#039;ll enjoy the series to the very end, if you&#039;re not too fast to criticize and drop.<br />
its not a serious anime series like for example code geass or anything like that, but it has its own charm like every single anime series right?<br />
<br />
Art: I have to say that i am interested in this kind of artwork depending the story and the whole concept  always, its smooth and cute, having some really sweet details also having some female characters drawn really sexy while others might be cute and lolis, in other words i really like it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: JUST HILARIOUS, there are some really &quot;stupid&quot; accidents that make you cry from laugher.<br />
<br />
Remember this is just my personal though on this series.<br />
<br />
Q:Is it worth watching it???<br />
A:YES!! and if you&#039;re also a pervert you&#039;ll like it even more ;) have fun!

    As much as I&#039;ve wanted to finally see a guy hits a girl, showing em what gender equality is all about, this anime wasn&#039;t really all that satisfying or really all that entertaining tbh. The setting in itself seem to be the most ideal setting for any feminist to wish for, where the school is fully dominated by women with rights to possessed a weapon and physically use it to assault others or cut them without any consequences being done to them (like em police, government, the principal should do something about it); you could also add in the assimilation of femininity, by making all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246945">
        men turn gay with make up, since this school that was once an all girl school, and most female student saw men as vile, vicious, or a rapey beast.  Aside from showing all the female student&#039;s ignorance of men, the pretentious gays in this show look very disturbing, especially that fucking big head dude. And I just dont see any reason to make these kind of disturbing character other than wanting people to shy away from the series. <br />
<br />
All that aside, this is just your typical cliche anime, with many of the anime tropes and setting, filled with women and a legit badass MC; where he gets a harem out of it by dominating them in a fight. Usually it&#039;s the other way around where the harem starts before the fight, but this anime go through that process of acquiring em ladies through beating them, where the MC usually show no or very little sexual interest, or having shown any signs hinting of a romance between his harem partners.  Talking about the character, some girls in the show, especially the blonde hair one and the croissant hair looking girl, does give u that cringy-ness being added on to the show. I mean their fucking character imitating or speaking in a very horrible accent of a foreign language and try to pretend one is weebish and cringed just like I said. Plus, the blonde hair girl is just your typical big boob, with a tsundere like personality that usually blurt out stuff that imply that she&#039;s actually a very slutty on the inside (well the big boob already kinda give that point across to its viewers). That&#039;s not to say that the show is consisted of disturbing and cringy characters, there are some pretty cool ghastly girl who gives off a macabre vibes, cute and adorable lolis, and so on.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to the story really aside from a very few flashback screen of our MC&#039;s past, or of other character in the show that belong to the member of the five sword, aka, the student council of the school? or just a group of respected girls who control the fucking school I guess. In addition to that, the story progression of this anime is pretty slow, and almost makes you wanted to skip to the part where action and stuff finally gets to happen in the anime. This ofc is not that much of an ordeal, but it just gets boring u know? Excluding all the cute interaction scene, some ecchi that some of u may liked (I definitely dont, I cant handle the tease u know? I would rather watch a hentai), panties shot, awesomely animated fight scene, and so on. But hey, the cliche of people from the five sword people talking when one of their members, or them and a group of their henchmen fighting against the MC, that&#039;s actually pretty annoying.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, it&#039;s a fun show, it may get boring at times but nevertheless, it&#039;s not that bad if you wanna see a different kinda harem story involving men hitting girls, and later have them go after the MC&#039;s D at their very own discretion.

    Warning possible Spoilers<br />
<br />
Reading the description of this anime it definitely reminded me of Prison School luckily though this wouldn&#039;t be that well known cringefest instead we got something that was actually very entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
The story centres on Fudou Nomura a delinquent who has been sent to The Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy to be controlled after getting into a fight, but he isn&#039;t a pushover and to gain leave from the school he must get a stamp from each of The Supreme Five Swords easier said than done.<br />
Now honestly the story to begin with starts out very simple which is Nomura trying to get a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257176">
        stamp from each of the five girls who are part of the The Supreme Five Swords which always ends up with him fighting them and boy are these fights entertaining, overtime as he defeats each girl the next one always being a little stronger and those that get defeated do start to fall for him which makes you think it turns into you&#039;re usual cliched harem hell no this doesn&#039;t happen here as only two of the girls really fall for him while the others just either help him out or stay in the sidelines.<br />
When the final battle happens though it does turn into a love-hate type of thing which didn&#039;t ruin the show for me, but it kinda seemed like a meh way to end it even though those final episodes were really intense to watch.<br />
When you look at the genres and think hhhmmm somethings missing technically you&#039;re right since comedy is also a big factor in this show, but really it is mostly an action show which did surprise in some way because looking at the poster you&#039;d think otherwise, but when I watched it every episode had a big fight which was surprisingly entertaining as not many anime&#039;s can be entertaining when it focuses mostly on action yet this one can.<br />
<br />
Now aside from the good fights the characters are also what makes this show very good as some these characters really stand out.<br />
Fudou Nomura is the male MC and he continues the trend of asshole characters that we have seen a few times lately, but just like those guys he&#039;s pretty damn cool and a badass hell he also has morals too as some of the girls do try to taunt him yet he manages to control himself which was a surprise to see and despite having to fight these girls he doesn&#039;t hate them afterwards sure he doesn&#039;t get along with them, but he does compliment them sometimes and is grateful whenever they help him out in a situation.<br />
Rin Onigawara is the first girl Nomura encounters, Rin was one of my favourites of the show because even though she is one of those bossy types she does actually have a nice cute side which was always adorable to see especially in moments where you see her and Nomura connect a little more, sadly though she was paired up with a character that pretty much got on my nerves which sorta hurt Rin&#039;s reputation a little.<br />
Mary Kikakujou is the second girl Nomura encounters and she is to me the worst character of the group, she has a french background so she prefers a rapier instead of a Katana and despite being the girl with the big oppai she is annoying as hell well not annoying to the extent that I hate, but she was annoying and honestly she didn&#039;t really offer much to the table either as everyone else pretty much overshadowed her.<br />
Warabi Hanasaka is the third girl Nomura encountered, she only escapes worse because she actually became friends with Nomura and helped him out a few times, she does have an over eccentric personality often making herself feel like a queen along with having that annoying chuckle her type of characters have which did feel overused at somepoint though luckily she doesn&#039;t use it as often once Nomura defeated her plus you won&#039;t see her without Kyou-bou who is Warabi&#039;s pet bear and fighting buddy who also becomes more friendly with Nomura after fighting him.<br />
Satori Tamaba is the fourth girl Nomura encountered, Satori definitely became another favourite because she is incredibly weird and really devious as she tries to put Nomura in a difficult position at some point, she always speaks in a slow fashion making her seem dimwitted which isn&#039;t the case and certainly has a lot less shame compared to the other girls when it comes to fighting.<br />
Tsukuyo Inaba is the final member that Nomura encounters and she is actually blind so she relies heavily on her hearing to move around which makes her notice things much quicker compared to the other girls, she is pretty much a Kuudere since she is very quiet and doesn&#039;t show much emotion, but she is very powerful and shouldn&#039;t be underestimated.<br />
Kirukiru Amou is the antagonist of the series and despite not appearing much until the final episodes she is a very cold, ruthless and dangerous person as she uses her own hands much like Nomura as weapons except she uses them like swords and if it weren&#039;t for the Academies headmistress she would probably have killed a few people although despite her badass appearance the whole reason why she goes out on a frenzy is because she had a crush on Nomura and she only wanted to be his friend which didn&#039;t really go well for her and that seems like a very stupid reason to go around hurting everyone.<br />
<br />
Now the artstyle was really good as the choreography of the fights was done well and there didn&#039;t seem like any CGI was involved which made it even better, but there really wasn&#039;t much else as the characters seemed okay with they&#039;re designs, but isn&#039;t something I haven&#039;t seen before along with the school and other things although you can definitely tell between the differences of living standards for the female and male students.<br />
<br />
Now the Action which is the main sauce of the show is really good, enjoyable to watch and last for a good while which is definitely a good thing because I don&#039;t want fights that are over in seconds and luckily these fights can drag on for almost an entire episode which shows that the show stays true to it&#039;s word.<br />
<br />
There is also some other stuff that isn&#039;t in the genres like Comedy which was actually very funny, I liked the chemistry between Nomura and the girls as he usually jokes around with them when usually it&#039;s the other way around so it&#039;s nice to see a male protagonist getting the advantage over harsh female characters and there are a lot of jokes between the two sides that are really funny, there is also a fair amount of Ecchi/fanservice though not to the extent where it&#039;s distracting well except where Satori fights Nomura nude which is something that definitely surprised me, but the other moments like this are spread out very nicely and don&#039;t really go much further than that.<br />
<br />
Overall this was an entertaining show that could have a season 2, but considering that Nomura achieved his goal I&#039;m very unsure and the way the show ended seemed fine so I&#039;m not sure if this needs a second season, putting that aside this&#039;ll definitely be a good show for those fans who are looking for a good action anime.

The concept of turning delinquent’s boys into girls in order to be accepted in this school isn’t easy to swallow and it’s unclear how this alarming act of extreme violence is acknowledged by everyone under the name of ‘Peace’. The world building is retarded and extreme to the point where the school finds everything sexually wrong! To think this kind of mentality is drilled into all the students is scary, for who knows what the hell would happen once they spread out in society! The MC gets tortured just because he was in a picture with another naked girl??

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261392">
        Where did the girl’s punishment go?? Just cause she’s from the 5 Swords group, she is to be forgiven?? The fact that teenagers are carrying weapons (the 5 main girls are acquitted with real swords!) to physically beat men is not an acceptable premise nor the fact that those 5 main girls are dosed off on hormones and resort to actually killing each other for very stupid reasons! Do remember this show has no Comedy tag so I took it seriously and I didn’t enjoy a lot because the show couldn’t defend these ridiculous claims! So, I just switched off my brain and started watching this anime simply as a ‘Popcorn Flick’ and you know what? I started to have fun, was laughing at the well-timed jokes and all the craziness along with it! I realized you must accept this weird idea to enjoy the anime which worked like a charm! Despite the show’s promise at the beginning, it can’t seem to capitalize on it due to the lack in depth with its story and characters. And the Harem is simply shoved down our throats as every girl falls for the MC, I bought the first girl and was kinda okay with the second one, but the rest were just shoehorned! And they fall for him after he beats them in combat which is also achieved in a corny manner! So where does this anime work then? The answer is Comedy and I’m very surprised as to why this anime has no ‘Comedy’ tag. The jokes and their setups were bold in its execution, a little creative, a tad bit repetitive but they were timely performed. Sadly, the final arc was lazily told, choppy edited and stupidly rushed which leaves a bad taste in your mouth when all is said and done!<br />
<br />
Nomura (MC) comes off both cool and badass but he’s bland with very senseless and questionable motives that sometimes make him unlikable, no a better word is unrelatable. The work done on his facial expressions were lousy which didn’t help his case either but he’s not your generic clueless MC. Nomura is a hot-headed guy who just wants some peace and will do anything to get his freedom! Aside from him, all the characters are One-Note who have only 1 object on their minds! All the girls start as strong Feminist, but the main female characters slowly change after spending time with the MC. I am not gonna go into details because we have many girls here, but they all generally have some bad trait to them as well as a unique sword fighting style. They are cute sure, but they are also very stupid which makes them annoying, especially Satori and that French (or Spanish) wannabe girl with the wig and that maddening LAUGH!!! Empress is the only character that exhibits potential, but they even spoil her in the end by giving her no depth at all.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty much your average Harem anime style with choppy editing and I had a big problem with the character designs. The girls were well-defined, both in their looks, expressions and attires while Nomura had mediocre overall work done on him! Also, the Voice Actor for Nomura had an annoying voice to him which was a poor choice since the girls came off better in this department as well. The fight styles are a 50-50 to me! On one hand, they were more credible in the sense of being accomplished with pace and rhythm. No one was shouting their Special moves or style out loud, but they rather appeared as text at the bottom. But then the sword play displayed didn’t always look unique, sometimes it felt like they were just swinging around! The OP is nice, and while the soundtrack is nothing beguiling, I totally dig the ED due to its catchy tune.<br />
<br />
Yet despite all the fighting styles of the girls, Nomura beat them all with either his Special move or come up with some convenient technique which made the show predictable and boring. You would think the rest of the girls could have come up with some way to avoid his Special move but nothing of that sort is even mentioned! And the armour plot here is ludicrous to the point where a character would be get all slashed up and lose lots of blood but the very next day they are completely fine! The one arc which showed capacity was the past of the MC so they saved that till the end to create a finale for the show which sucked because they turned this into a bullshit cliched arc that was rushed and totally ruined the character, Empress for me! The final fight was decent, but the big payoff didn’t work because you aren’t invested in the feelings of the characters nor the story for it to work! How can you when you are given half episode of flashbacks as storytelling! The Comedy seriously saves this anime from a disaster as it kept you entertained for the whole 12 episodes. I am only giving this anime a high rating just cause the Comedy caught me off-guard because the rest is just meh.

    Armed Girls Machiavellianism is an anime that certainly improves as it goes along.  Every season, there usually some shows that I change my ratings for throughout their air time, no matter if it&#039;s lowering the score or upping it.  This anime anime was certainly one of the cases where I upped my score a little (at least in value, but not overall), but it wasn&#039;t until it was almost at the end (after episode 11).  I really liked it despite the aspects that can seem generic, but it felt different.  I&#039;m not going to pretend I&#039;m a critical person here because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250703">
        I&#039;m not all that critical most times.  This show felt different and it really drew me into what was happening on screen, but I want you to consider that this is not a review written by a critical person so do not try to star arguments over the review even though I know may people consider it generic; I just want to try to prevent trouble before it starts, even though the chance of it occurring is low, in my mind. <br />
<br />
Now at the basic level, the story has nothing more than a trouble making teenager, name Fudo Nomura, who is enrolled at a co ed school, that is completely dominated by females to the point that guys are expected to weir ugly female face masks and that even a group with elite sword skills, the supreme five swords, pretty much run much of the school and are in charge of correcting the males, especially the ones who don&#039;t follow the rules.  Surprisingly, it actually becomes a really good story that draws you into what is happening.  It shifts more towards focusing on Fudo earning his stamps on his permission slip so he can leave the academy while following the rules.  It starts off with him simply facing off against different girls in the five swords early on and becomes more entertaining and gripping later, and actually has some nice twists while still not being complicated.  Even though it seems like  a harem at times, it&#039;s not and it doesn&#039;t go overboard with the harem like scenes.  It becomes really character focused and is quite comedic, and the ending is amazing, considering how the show is.  I&#039;ll give the story an 8. <br />
<br />
The art seems different too.  It&#039;s not very colorful, but it certainly doesn&#039;t feel plain.  Some of the character designs are a little weird, such as with Satori, Rin, and Chouka.  They&#039;re not off putting, but the designs for Chouka and Satori do lower the art score a little for me.  The back grounds and actual animation seemed pretty consistent with some occasional drops at the beginning of episodes and a few times in the middle of certain episodes, but it&#039;s not that noticeable.  The character designs, backgrounds and animation quality were actually really good or even great as a whole.  The creators did a great job at making sure stuff didn&#039;t seem out of place and the times that the quality did drop seemed to be conveying a more serious tone when everything shouldn&#039;t be extremely vibrant and overly colorful.  I definitely feel like most of the main designs are really unique, despite some of them being creepy, like with Satori, and the animation quality drops didn&#039;t seem like it was just due to laziness.  Since there were some obvious quality drops though and 2 really weird character designs, Satori and Chouka, this category doesn&#039;t feel like it has earned a 9 in my book, even though I like the majority of the other designs a lot as well as the majority of the art, but I don&#039;t think there are enough problem to totally drop my score that much, so an 8 it is.  <br />
<br />
The soundtrack has some great battle music  and other scores that added to the intensity of scenes really nicely.  Shocking Blue is actually a really good and maybe a great opening, but I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s more towards the very good side.  Decide is one of the best ending themes I&#039;ve heard; it really shows one of the anime&#039;s main messages with it&#039;s lyrics, which I&#039;d say is that the characters stick with each through thick and thin when they get one another and they&#039;re not going to simply someone leave their side without a good reason.   That&#039;s my take on it anyway, and it&#039;s an unexpected one considering how the girls act towards Fudo early in the story, and how unlikely it is that a school dominated by females would have females that are willing to go through great lengths to keep a guy at their sides (not in the sexual way).  I give the music an 8. <br />
<br />
The character portion is difficult to describe and I&#039;m only actually to describe Fudo Nomura.  Before, I&#039;m asked why I would cut out the rest of main cast from my review, I&#039;ll give a simple reason.  Honestly, I find it hard to actually describe the girls in convincing words to people that probably have not watched the show yet, as I think my description would make them sound too generic and uninteresting.  I feel that the female cast,especially, needs to be experienced for yourself to actually determine if you like the cast or not.  I don&#039;t feel like my thoughts can be expressed clearly and concisely here and describing them wouldn&#039;t reflect my true thoughts.  <br />
 <br />
Now that I gave my reason, which is longer than I expected it to be, I&#039;ll describe Fudo Nomura.  He doesn&#039;t come off as a guy who thinks he is superior in every way to the girls he is fighting.  He doesn&#039;t seem to hold back in his fights and he doesn&#039;t fight to show off his skills.   The final episode explains why he fights in a great, yet very simple way.  He fights to show where he stands, and not just to win.  I think that is actually a great way to fight and it could help prevent you from clouding your judgement with rage and eagerness to win;  I&#039;d rather win of course, myself, but I find it to be a great way to approach a fight still.  He interacts well with all the girls too despite his attitude about sticking to his ground and not agreeing to submission, very easily, when it even happens.  I find him to be a great mix between a capable main character and one that is viewed as weak.  He&#039;s not the best fighter and doesn&#039;t easily win fights without putting in effort like some characters, but he&#039;s not helpless either, and he certainly is capable of holding his own in martial arts based fight, which the type of fights seen int he anime.  I give the characters another 8.  It&#039;s not the best cast, but it&#039;s still a really good cast with a great main character.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment score is a 9  I always really enjoyed the anime, but I started to like it more and more gradually and the amazing ending for the way show is and everything else that happens throughout the last two episodes brought up my enjoyment score a bit drastically from the lower 8 range up to my current 9.  It&#039;s a show that surprised me and surpassed my initial expectations.<br />
<br />
I hope more people watch the show and like it.  It doesn&#039;t feel generic like many people think.<br />
<br />

    If I had to describe this anime in one short phrase it&#039;d be &quot;shallow entertainment of the highest caliber&quot;. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;ve ever seen a more simplistic, straightforward, dare I even say cookie cutter harem/action/school/comedy anime, at least not one I enjoyed this greatly. Still though, this anime knows what kind of show it is and I had a blast binging it.<br />
<br />
One thing that makes Armed Girl&#039;s Machiavellianism (that&#039;s the first and only time I&#039;m typing out that long-ass word in this review) stand out among its peers of the generic harem/action genre is that fact that effort was clearly put into the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319975">
        action and fight sequences. Look, they ain&#039;t anywhere near KLK or TTGL level, but they&#039;re definitely above average and did enough to get me pretty hype at times. It&#039;s also worth noting that the animation quality does NOT drop after one episode like in some action anime. Likewise, the music, voice acting, and sound effects are also all-around very solid on a consistent basis, there wasn&#039;t any one thing I&#039;d single out as truly exceptional but it was all very good.<br />
<br />
I really liked the characters, even though the MC was very typical in a lot of ways and the girls were pretty much waifu-bait. One thing I will say about the MC is that he isn&#039;t a fucking wimp and even if everything else about him is pretty basic, that makes the anime a lot more enjoyable than if he were some pushover. I&#039;m a sucker for waifu-bait, so I liked most of the girls. It&#039;s ridiculous how quickly and easily they fall for the MC though. First they try to correct his &quot;delinquent&quot; behavior by challenging him in a fight (they use swords and he has sword-proof gloves and a special &quot;magic bullet&quot; move). Once he beats them, they go almost instantly from trying to chop his nuts off to trying to liking him and trying to protect him from the next girl who will try to chop his nuts off. It&#039;s just hilarious to me how quickly this transition happens, it&#039;s so bad and stupid that it&#039;s funny. <br />
<br />
When you get right down to it, with the girls falling quickly for the badass, charismatic MC and every other guy in the school being a submissive crossdresser (due to being &quot;corrected&quot; by the sword-wielding girls), this is pretty much the most obvious harem-wish-fullfillment type of deal you could possibly get. Just a word of warning, if you go in expecting any realistic male-female romantic interaction in this anime, you&#039;ll be taking it too damn seriously!<br />
<br />
The middle part of the anime was probably the best for me, the show has a pretty average climax, final fight, and ending (not one I would say is disappointing but didn&#039;t exceed expectations quite as well as the rest of the show). The beginning of the show introduces the characters pretty quickly and gives us a good fight right in episode one. The reason I say the show was the best towards the middle was because that was where the situations the fights took place in started really getting fun and ridiculous (sumo-wrestling a bear or fighting in a bath and using lewdness to distract and throw off your opponent for instance). It was a really fun ride and left me wanting more. Perhaps if this show were 24 episodes or so and there was more time for more of those fun, ridiculous fights to happen, I&#039;d have given this show an elite-tier rating of 8, but alas, it wasn&#039;t meant to be.<br />
<br />
Well, that about wraps up the bulk of this review. Chances are, if you read all that crap, you&#039;re either thinking &quot;damn, I gotta watch this show, sounds fun&quot; or &quot;yeah, no way I&#039;d enjoy this, I like a good story and/or dislike waifu-harem wish fulfillment&quot;. Well, I don&#039;t actually know what you&#039;re thinking but I&#039;ve done my best to paint a pretty clear picture of what type of show this is, now it&#039;s your call if you wanna watch it or not. Personally, I really enjoyed this anime and I LOVED Satori, she&#039;s best girl for sure and is the latest victim in my ever-growing list of &quot;lesser known top-tier waifus who don&#039;t have nearly enough merch and fanart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall score - 7.5/10 (Great)

    This anime might seem same as any other harem anime, but the plot and the whole summary is actually pretty different. As we all know the main character is a transfer student and his new school has some weird rules where they force males to dress and act like a girl, but he refuses. Shojo part of the anime isn&#039;t bad either, character development as for the main character is pretty good but doesn&#039;t cover other supporting characters, well that&#039;s because anime itself is pretty short. Art is pretty solid and the sound isn&#039;t bad either. I gave it 10/10, yes it is a harem

        anime but it also has a unique plot and if nothing it&#039;s pretty funny. So if you&#039;re not a huge fan of harem anime, watch this one just to laugh a bit.

    Going to go against the prevailing reviews, and give it a review score of 7 (its really about a 7.5 but can&#039;t give it that) and My Anime list has its screwy system where scores below 7 mean bad and above 8 mean ridiculously good.<br />
<br />
The problem with most of the negative reviews is they can&#039;t absorb the fact this is a comedy.  I really can&#039;t fault the reviewers here, with the way things are in the world today, anyone under forty can&#039;t even comprehend common sense in relationships between men and women. Unfortunately that&#039;s going to make it impossible for them to enjoy this.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325159">
        Maybe they should take a few minutes and watch &quot;The Taming of  the Shrew&quot; to get their heads screwed on right. <br />
<br />
If you are going to enjoy this you need to treat it like the screwball comedy it is. Think of the front page, or Mr Blandings builds his dream house, it&#039;s not meant to resemble reality and it operates on not on logic but comedy logic.  The school is a stupid idea, so was Classroom of the Elite, Kakeguri, etc, etc. On it&#039;s own it&#039;s a maybe a 5 on the funny meter, and it&#039;s got about an 8 or a 9 on the interesting meter. You have to be willing to accept the idea and laugh with it.<br />
<br />
Once you get past the concept there&#039;s lots of good gags in here, unfortunately they&#039;re all at the chuckle or a little better level. The biggest problem is they overwhelmingly involve attacks with deadly weapons that also have wounds being inflicted. When a boulder falls on the coyote it&#039;s funny because he never gets hurt. If he got turned into bloody paste it&#039;s not only not funny it&#039;s really mood breaking.  Think of the life of Brian, where they take one of the least funny events in human history, the crucifixion and manage to turn it into a laugh riot. They just don&#039;t manage it here. Like I said they get chuckles but no belly laughs, which is a shame because it could have been better.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also the problem of using the same gag too, toooo, toooo often.  Real proof that once it&#039;s funny, 50 times it&#039;s a migraine.<br />
<br />
The characters are a little too nasty to be truly funny and I certainly didn&#039;t feel for them.  The girls just didn&#039;t do it for me. You can have comic psychopaths, but it has to be handled as comedy. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with the Japan there&#039;s some things that just aren&#039;t funny. Imagine bewitched exploring Samantha being tortured by the inquisition, in serious fashion. It would ruin the show.  Nomura is OK but he never goes far enough and lets himself gets walked over too much.  That would have been fine if he was a doormat character but he isn&#039;t. They could of done themselves a favor by borrowing from William Shatner in the Trek episode Elaan of Troyius. It&#039;s a good watch for this and really shows fun ways to deal with yanderes. Taming of the shrew would have also been a good read for the writers. <br />
<br />
 <br />
The voice acting is good. and the music is good but doesn&#039;t really maximize the comedy. I don&#039;t usually bother to score the opening and ending music because after the first time, but if you&#039;re interested it&#039;s some sort of bubble gum rock in Japanese.<br />
<br />
Final verdict, it&#039;s very watchable and enjoyable, but could have been a lot better.

    Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism is a very simple, fast show. Unsurprisingly, I don&#039;t have much to say about it.<br />
<br />
The premise of a school overtaken by armed girls allows for a lot of crazy things to take place. There&#039;s a masculine guy fighting girls, each one with a different weapon and fighting style, there&#039;s a girl who has a bear, who he also fights in a sumo match, there&#039;s tons of fanservice that is implemented in a way that actually isn&#039;t just for the sake of itself, as it attempts to create some comedic situations and even characterize some with the sheer idea that they like to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250638">
        walk around or fight without any clothes. I would say that the reason it works, is because of the main character himself.<br />
<br />
Homura is just a guy who wants to go to a normal school, and be a free, cool dude, but isn&#039;t allowed to. In order to be free he has to get stamps from all the higher ups in the girls&#039; ranks. Because the school is a correcting facility, he immediately is forced to uphold the law that says all boys will be turned into good citizens by turning them into transvestites (don&#039;t ask, I don&#039;t know what exactly is that supposed to help with as well. My best shot would be that it makes them lose all of their bravado and make them behave). He refuses, gets in a fight, falls on the girl he was fighting and accidently kisses her.<br />
Cue the cliche kissing music.<br />
Soon after all the other members of the &quot;Supreme Five Swords&quot; take interest in him and he has to beat them up and get them to act normally so they can give him the stamp. Slowly but surely they all warm up to him, he warms up to them and some drama starts occurring. Homura works well, because there&#039;s a lot of other viewpoints showcased bit by bit, he has a cheeky personality and his own, distinct fighting style, not to mention that he is ripped. All of this makes him a good, recognizable MC, doesn&#039;t feel like a self-insert at no point. He&#039;s characterized well enough. While his presentation feels fairly natural, with the characters Homura fights after the second half of the show, it can feel forced and rushed. The entire deal with the Empress in the last three episodes could symbolize that perfectly. It works, it&#039;s explained, but it has absolutely no impact as it feels like just another rushed characterization.<br />
If I were to talk about the girls and how they behave, I would take away most of the fun from this show. They don&#039;t exactly have deep personalities, though some have their reasons, so telling you what they are would get rid of most of the content. The most entertaining part about this show is by far meeting new girls and finding out about their fighting styles, their personalities and their reasons for getting interested in Homura. Once again, those aren&#039;t anything deep, but with so many cool, well designed characters, you do have this itch that tells you that you want to know more about them. Besides, you wouldn&#039;t need anyone&#039;s explanation to know what they&#039;re all about, this show doesn&#039;t hide it. It&#039;s always been very straightforward with their personalities.<br />
<br />
The visuals are fine, but because it is Silver Link after all, they only look okay because the things that are shown need little animation. There aren&#039;t many shots where characters actually fight, rather there are ones where they attack, cut into a different camera angle, another attack, another cut, the other person attacks, another camera cut. You can see how this can leave some less than impressive results. That&#039;s not to say that there aren&#039;t any impressive-looking moments, it&#039;s just that the it&#039;s really inconsistent. The art style itself is okay, the school is designed properly and there are different places for each fight, the character designs are great and can tell you a lot about their character just by looking at them, just as an example Rin wears half of a devil mask. Isn&#039;t that immediately intriguing? The fact that those sort of things get explained as you go is also a huge plus. Another thing that really caught my eye are the clothes and school uniforms. This show has a great sense of fashion, there&#039;s a lot of nicely fitting outfits with matching colors. I have to praise them for that.<br />
The director seems to have had some ideas as to how to present certain moments, there&#039;s surely a good amount of thought put into them, especially the mostly well scripted fight scenes, but there are periods of time where everything looks more generic than even it&#039;s art style. Not to mention some needlessly cheesy scenes, like the rose petals flying through the air as Homura and his last opponent get up close. It&#039;s not this kind of series, it never was, it doesn&#039;t fit. The directors tried quite a bit, but it wasn&#039;t quite enough. <br />
<br />
The sound is... well... it sure does exist and it sure does its job, but were I say more about anything other than the pretty good and fitting opening and the ending, I would have some hard time. The sounds of metal as it hits Homura and the instances where he uses his Magic Bullet are the only ones that stuck to me, despite there being much more. The silliest one would have to be the bear&#039;s voice actress who tries so hard to be mad and loud, but actually sounds frail and weak in each roar. That&#039;s not a positive by the way, it&#039;s almost pathetic. The soundtrack definitely improves all the scenes to some degree, but the musical directing isn&#039;t anything great here, just like the visual directing.<br />
<br />
This is about everything that you need to know about Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism without going into spoilers. If you want to watch it, you should. It&#039;s a solid battle series with a good, yet simple cast, gets better the more of them are introduced. It&#039;s easy to binge, looks pretty enough and has a lot of cool and dumb moments that should stick with you for a while. It has some solid comedic timing and knows how to script its fights and some casual scenes. Unfortunately this is about all it does and it had some weaker points here and there in terms of its writing, it always swirled around the mediocre to good range, however if you feel like spending some quality time with some quality armed waifus, you should give it a shot.<br />
<br />
As always, this is purely my opinion, I recommend you to develop your own.

    I&#039;m not gonna lie, seeing all these old ass reviews going all critic on the show. like it&#039;s supposed to be some massive hit film or something, sure the story is mediocre at best and the characters are pretty cookie cutter (aside from a couple) I still enjoyed it. Ending was pretty decent main climax was mediocre but overall I still liked watching. Don&#039;t know why people rate it so low though. From a specific angle, and in the right light, I get it kinda but it&#039;s just sad to see so many people disliking it. Not to say it&#039;s gold, there are plenty of

    I&#039;ve been here on MAL since 2012 I think and this is the first time im writing a review<br />
because this anime deserves it, if trough a review I can get at least one person to watch this underrated masterpiece then Im happy.<br />
Ok, lets go<br />
The story begins at an all girls school that just become CO-ED mostly girls are feminists , the boys who entered the school out of fear were forced to dress and act like girls, except for our MC who fought back, and instead of just plainly defeating them (which would be boring) he made friends whith them , he earned their trust

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249535">
        , and his prupose is to get their seals so he can leave school grounds (they are not permitted to leave until graduation) . Also theres one major antagonist who seems to have a past with the MC and she will likely be the last boss of the series.<br />
What was supposed to be a harem / ecchi filled boring shounem anime because of its cute and well developed charaters , the fierce battles , the intense dialogue and the good animation quality and ost  becomes maybe the AOTS.. altough the show is not over yet i get the feeling that the conclusion will live to expectations. I started this show out of the blue.. simply to kill my free time when I get home from work. And now its the show im most looking foward to watch. <br />
Also, the explanations during the battles, the author created very coherent techniques , fighting styles and made it in a way easy to understand .. they just dont pull out random shit like in Mahouka for example and because of this when someone wins or loses a battle you agree with everything that happened , you&#039;re left with ways of imagining the upcoming course of the show because its logic are solid and coherent. Give Busou Shoujo a try. You wont regret it.

    Machiavellianism is an anime that everyone saw like billion times in their lifetime, or is it?<br />
<br />
When I first saw the title and the concept art, I cannot help but feel repelled, as many mediocre shows immediately got in my mind, and I thought I had better things to do (like preparing my exams). But then recently, a guy called LexBurner made a video on this anime and portrayed it as more of an interesting attempt of following Kill la Kill (which I haven&#039;t watched, but will eventually after my exams).  This pepped my interest, and with Lex&#039;s description, I&#039;ve decided to give it a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267287">
        go.<br />
<br />
Holy **** this is enjoyable.<br />
<br />
First of all, aside from the mc, everyone is in some way as generic as it gets. You can tell by their designs which type of characters they are. The fun thing is that, at least in my opinion, the fact that they don&#039;t even hide it and use that trait exclusively makes it so much more fun to watch than those anime who try to pretend that their characters aren&#039;t generic. The mc, on the other hand, although not the most interesting character ever (I would attribute that to Okabe Rintarou), is entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall for the character, a solid 7<br />
<br />
Regarding the story, nothing happened aside from setting the scenes and characters in the first season through individual arcs. What I would say is that they are sometimes hilarious and in most cases not offensively stupid (not that it does not happen, don&#039;t get me wrong)<br />
<br />
Mediocre 5.5 (rounded up to 6, I&#039;m not that picky)<br />
<br />
Art and music:<br />
<br />
Subjective feelings, don&#039;t have anything to comment on<br />
<br />
For the enjoyment, WTF is this enjoyable. The most obvious element to this high score is our MC, his reactions to stuff happening around are genuinely interesting, which could be best shown through how he held back not touching the boobs even though his face shows that he obviously wants to. Another aspect is how the show will throw you off guard by going out of their way to do some stupidly hilarious yet not offensive stuff.<br />
<br />
For those who want serious plots, characters and themes like Steins;Gate, you&#039;re at the wrong place. For those who want to have a laugh to relieve stress, this might be what you want (as comedy is subjective)<br />
<br />
Overall a strong 7/10

    This anime is so weird but so average that there might honestly be something for watching it.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
<br />
The premise is that an all girl school now allows boys but the girls are scared so they asked to be allowed weapons for self defence. The school has the 5 swords which are 5 of the best girl fighters and the empress. These 5 swords force boys to act feminine or leave the school.<br />
Our protagonist Nomura is a new transfer student and he is like &quot;No way freedom for all&quot; and then for some reason he has to fight all of the 5 swords. <br />
<br />
The story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311867">
        dumb, really dumb. It honestly makes no sense why he is even fighting the 5 swords but each arc is based on fighting one of the fight swords. Every time he wins the 5 sword member joins his side for some reason...<br />
<br />
Except near the end where they are just rushing to try and end the series so the last member just joins him without any logical sense. <br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
It&#039;s okay but nothing special. The fight animation isn&#039;t that special either and neither is the art style. But it ain&#039;t terrible.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
The OST does it&#039;s job but it ain&#039;t memorable whatsoever. The sound effects are decent as well.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
The characters feel different from one another. However, the characters just side with the MC after being beaten and some fall for him for no logical reason. The side characters also support him because??? <br />
The only potentially interesting character was Amou the Empress who only properly does something at the end but it was rushed so it just gets resolved in a poor fight. The abilities don&#039;t make too much sense either like auto counter but it&#039;s a shounen so whatever.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
It was okay and that is really it

    Many reviewers have said this is just your typical boring harem comedy action anime. As such, with being categorized as a harem type, I was very reluctant to even watch it. IMO, harems are too arrogant, presumptuous, fantasy since they involve several females interested in the one MC.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. There were 5+1 main females so you know the story will somehow progress thru one of them at a time. There personalities and backstories though were quite interesting. As well, it was refreshing, to me, that not all but only 2+1 of them had a romantic angle with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332414">
        the male MC. Also, I liked the fact that the male MC had a clear preference for one girl (not a bad choice) ..... not the common theme where he likes all of them &quot;equally&quot;. Finally, it surely has been done before, but the one intense/weird love that the &quot;+1&quot; female had for the male MC was also quite an attractive/hot relationship explored in this story.

    This is an anime that seems like it&#039;s based off a visual novel, <br />
And that visual novel would be very fun to play, but it&#039;s not, and sadly because the lack of world building or actual consequences, render this anime extremely paper thin.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously and manages to keep itself going at a steady clip with virtually no filler, which is more than I can say for most single season 13 episode anime. It was an enjoyable watch, with a consistent story. While that story wasn&#039;t very good, I can at least appreciate that they didn&#039;t try to make

        it bigger than it was, this started as a guy taking on 5 chicks with swords and varying social statuses, and ended with that same plot.<br />
<br />
6/10 an enjoyable watch but forgettable.
