    In the near future, in a world tarnished by lawlessness and disorder, exists an elite detective agency known as Milky Holmes. Represented by four talented young girls, the agency exists to fight against those that threaten the people&#039;s security. Through their struggles to preserve peace is a courageous, poignant story of mystery and betrayal...<br />
<br />
Wait, none of that has anything to do with Milky Holmes. Let&#039;s try again.<br />
<br />
For Sheryl, Cordelia, Elly and Nero, any shred of courage and talent is tossed aside within five minutes of the first episode. After losing their supernatural abilities— &quot;Toys&quot;, the once-esteemed detectives devolve into a group of scatterbrains miserably failing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90309">
        at every single thing that they set out to do. Bear attacking them in the forest? They try to befriend it. An antagonist&#039;s identity revealed in front of them? They assume it is cosplay. Between their innumerable failures, one inevitably starts to wonder if they would be more at home in a mental hospital rather than a detective academy. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s easy to recognize the four girls due to their colorful designs. Sheryl stands as your typical happy-go-lucky protagonist, characterized by her circular pigtails and massive hair bow that somehow outsizes her entire head. On the other hand, you have Cordelia, the equivocally &#039;mature&#039; member of the group who frequently falls into hysteric outbursts.  There is also Nero, an energetic tomboy, and Elly, a timid girl who speaks so little that you&#039;d confuse her as being mute. Generic it is, but the girls are made to stand out as a group more so than as individuals. This is not an anime about Sheryl, but an anime about Milky Holmes. <br />
<br />
Rather, the side characters are where the show shines. Serving as the series&#039; antagonist is the Gentlemen Thieves, a four member criminal organization led by Arsène and her enormous bosom. As a long-term rival to Milky Holmes, they more or less function as the show&#039;s equivalent to Team Rocket. In almost every episode, the two are involved in some sort of inane conflict with each other. The best part is the character &quot;Twenty&quot;, a man wearing a monocle and top hat who frequently rips his shirt off, screams to the heavens about his beauty, and runs around exposing his erect nipples to everybody in sight. Yes, seriously.<br />
<br />
There is also a third group named the Genius 4, a police unit which continually finds themselves pulled in between the nonsense of Milky Holmes and their rivals. The only character of note here is its leader Kokoro, a self-professed child genius with an IQ of &gt;1300. When not gloating about her questionable intellect, Kokoro is usually seen fulfilling her sadistic urges by manipulating the members of Milky Holmes, for often amusing and occasionally depressing results. It&#039;s a shame that so few episodes see her with any significant screen time, given that she&#039;s the most entertaining of the female characters. <br />
<br />
One of the more unique aspects of the series is that it is an homage to the detective genre. Blatant references to famous fictional detectives exist within the names of nearly every character (Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe), while common conventions of the genre are frequently parodied through the idiocy of the characters. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly find some level of amusement in all the references. <br />
<br />
Though do not expect mystery from Milky Holmes. There is none to be found here, aside from deep philosophical questions like how much damage the characters have received to their brain. Even the conflicts are resolved through supernatural powers and violence rather than any sort of reasoning or detective work.<br />
<br />
But that is the point of Milky Holmes. It is intentionally stupid. It&#039;s a comedy anime that does not waste unnecessary time on character and story development, nor does it pretend to be witty highbrow entertainment. It is easy, simple humor revolving around the exploits of Dumb and Dumber— compounded with a cast of excessively cute girls. Milky Holmes does an excellent job being what it is, but those who find this sort of comedy appalling would be advised to set their eyeballs in the other direction. You won&#039;t be missing a whole lot.  <br />
<br />
Occasionally the show does attempt to focus on its story, to largely dreadful results. The sudden dramatic tone makes for an uncomfortable and incongruous transition, taking away from the inherent appeal of the series. If everything after the first episode is filled with absurd humor, how is the viewer supposed to care when the story comes back at the end? Perhaps it may have been better with no plot at all.  Still, the climactic fight in the final episode was a surprisingly pleasant conclusion to the season. There&#039;s a neatly animated battle scene with Sheryl using her wits and power (for the first time), and in the last minutes we are treated with a very Milky Holmes-esque twist to the story. In other words, it is immensely silly. And flagrantly stupid.<br />
<br />
The art fidelity leaves much to be desired, but there isn&#039;t much to complain in terms of visual style. Character designs are colorful and appealing while the backgrounds employ a unique crayon-drawn aesthetic. Often though, you will see off-model faces and strange proportions in between important scenes. It&#039;s quite jarring and could easily be alleviated through a larger budget. <br />
<br />
Music is not Milky Holmes&#039; forte, but the excellent OP compensates for the forgettable score. It captures the charm of the anime and serves as a nice little treat before each episode begins. Adding to this is a solid cast of seiyuu who do a commendable job at making the comedic lines actually work. There&#039;s nothing worse than a comedy performed by lifeless actors, and thankfully Milky Holmes is in complete contrast to that. <br />
<br />
This is the kind of anime that only comes around every once in a while. For a medium where manzai humor and cliches are predominant, a title such as Milky Holmes almost seems alien. There&#039;s a certain charm to be found here, and if you can forgive the glaring flaws of the anime you will most likely be in for an enjoyable ride. Assuming of course, that you are not offended by protruding nipples and utter stupidity. <br />
<br />
Failure has never been this cute.

    I think that some people didn&#039;t know what exactly to expect from the series when they first went into it. Goodness knows I was expecting something else. My review is going to hopefully clear up some things for people, before they even pick up the Anime, because I garantee, some people aren&#039;t going to be happy with it.<br />
<br />
Story: (3+9)/2=6<br />
<br />
I have a ligitimate reason for giving the story an odd two part rating. In my case, it has to deal with the fact that from the summary I read, I was expecting something that was cute, innocent, almost like a brand new take on an old

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32390">
        Anime, CLAMP Gaukuen Tanteidan. As a mystery buff, I expected something series, with a mystery every episode.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t get that. Well, I got the whole cute thing, but this anime is like a fangirl writing fanfiction who has an interesting summary and then you find out that they are rabid, but not that they are a bad writer, just that they&#039;re... *cough* a little bit perverted in their writing, causing you to hit your head against the desk. Truth be told, these types that ARE actually well written are rare.<br />
<br />
As for the seriousness... there is none. It is completly comediec. You don&#039;t get any major mysteries in this series, it is more along the lines of adventure. Actually, I really have to question how these girls even became detectives. It is almost as if they are trying to parody and poke fun of the Mystery genera, in how the detectives always solve the cases. It is rather interesting in that regaurd.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
The art work is nice and crisp, the colors bright making one thinking it is a simple, happy go lucky children&#039;s Anime. Particularly if you haven&#039;t seen any clips that show the more... well, the moments that push it in some people&#039;s minds. Typically, I say that panty-shots (that&#039;s what I call them, though in this one there aren&#039;t really any shots of panties) aren&#039;t needed in most storylines to make it a good storyline. It&#039;s just there to attract people in. <br />
<br />
Well, with the way it is cut down later on, I think it did in fact use panty shots to draw a certain crowd in, but the humour and shots actually do add to the storyline. I think it has to do with how the characters are protrayed in the series, which I will get to later.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Sound is not my fortay, but I felt it was nice and I liked the opening and closing. Actually, I was laughing at some of the sound effects.<br />
<br />
Character: (6+10)/2=8<br />
<br />
I have another split rating here. Why? Well, obviously I was expecting smart detectives, but I ended up with some really dumb characters. All of the detetives are... well, as one character says... they are retarded. Their words, not mine. And then the bad guys... I have to slap my forehead, as they aren&#039;t bad guys. They&#039;re... well, for the most part brighter then the detectives, but they are also... nicer then how the girls start out. I say that because the girls were spoiled brats. Even with being parodic, the character have problems.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (4+10)/2=7<br />
<br />
I wanted something else really, so in that regaurd I was rather disapointed. But what I got... completly unexpected really. I got a story that was... I love parody, I love satire, and I can&#039;t help but look at this as a MAJOR comedic parody of the Detective Genera. And it pokes fun of the &#039;panty-shots&#039; other Anime put in.<br />
<br />
Overall: (6+8+10+8+7)/5=7.8<br />
<br />
Truth of the matter is, if you don&#039;t know what you are going in for, it is... or could be a major disapointment. It isn&#039;t a bad Anime though... simply... different is the best word for it.

    OK first of all, before you pick up this series, throw every expectation out of the window! Literally! <br />
Here&#039;s the most common perception people have on this anime;<br />
-&quot;Oh god, It&#039;s another lolicon&#039;s anime!&quot;<br />
Well, that&#039;s my first perception on it, but I can assure you, only the opening looks lolicon-ish. The rest of the show doesn&#039;t really promote pedophilia. How can you when the main villain of this series has gigantic b**b!<br />
<br />
-&quot;Wow! A mystery anime! Finally I get to watch something else other than Detective Conan!&quot;<br />
Once again, throw away that perception. Did the title say Detective Holmes? No. Unlike Detective Conan, it&#039;s clearly not stated it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33103">
        a detective show. Closest you&#039;ll get to them solving a case is almost to nil. The only mystery here is how they lost their powers and will they ever get it back.<br />
<br />
-&quot;Wow! An anime about cute little girls with superpowers!&quot;<br />
What do you think this is? The Powerpuff girls? Once again, No. I dont wan&#039;t to give any spoilers here but I can tell you, most of the time in the show isn&#039;t about special powers. Do not expect Alice Academy here.<br />
<br />
Other than that, if you gotten rid of all those three widely mistaken perception and just think of it as a comedy based anime, then im sure you&#039;ll be greatly entertained.<br />
<br />
Their stupidity and plain randomness is enough to leave your face bruises all over (Due to the excessive face-palm) Not to mention, throw in a narcissistic teacher, and you have the complete recipe for pure random comedy.<br />
Not to mention throw in a few panty shots.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty well done, it compliments the cheery and positive outlook the character have on their life, despite the misery it comes along for everyone else. <br />
Sound was exceptionally done. I especially love the sound effect you get when their toys are activated.<br />
Each character has their own unique personality, you wont find 2 or more characters in this anime with the same personality. However, be prepared for some cliche characters especially for the villain side.<br />
<br />
Moreover, this anime is enjoyable for every age group.. Yes, that means you too you lolicons! You would probably enjoy re watching all those funny moments of the narcissistic and all of this antics.<br />
<br />
Overall it is quite a unique and hilarious anime if you discard all your expectation. Come in with nothing, come out bursting with laughter (and bruises on your face) On one condition that you survived watching the first few episodes. (Im sorry to say but the action and comedy picked up midway through the anime, so does the fanservice bit)<br />
<br />
And there you have it,<br />
Haremu Kingu, signing off!

    SAO just like Milky holmes is a psychological delicacy that is undermined within the mainstream media as being a moe trash piece of garbage which when in fact it is really a genre defining academic text which would drive the most literally minded academics insane over the deep and complex issues conveyed of perpetual identity, symbolic relational symbolism, alternative character constructions and exploration through modern sociological issues within the show not to mention the ground breaking visuals which would send the most post modern shaft style shows to shame.<br />
<br />
Honestly i could spend hours unravelling and discussing the deep psychophysical themes of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84787">
        and in the perfect world i would but simply if you cannot objective agree that Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is a shining light among the generic money-pinching crap of contemporary modern anime-visuals and objectively deserves nothing less then a masterpiece 10/10 ranking you then have considerably shit taste and i feel for you.

    Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is a great title to detect people with alike mindset; if you stumble upon a favorite anime list with Milky Holmes included, it&#039;s generally a safe bet to try other high-rated titles there - similar mindset, simlilar taste that is.<br />
<br />
And it&#039;s all because one can&#039;t really praise Milky Holmes for its story, art, sound or characters in particular. <br />
<br />
The story mainly revolves around several cute magical girls who lost their powers due to a oppai villain and now fight to get them back.<br />
You will have to grow extra fingers in order to count titles like that, right? <br />
Art and sound are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219800">
        solid, but more moe had been seen before, even by J.C. Staff themselves.<br />
Characters are amazing in their retard-o-meter level, but, once again, you could probably find something else somewhere else on the anime no-return path you currently follow.<br />
<br />
So that&#039;s how we have quite low MAL ratings; logically speaking, they are logical. <br />
But Milky Holmes is not about logic.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about enjoying sheer insanity and bizarre flight of mind, a rollecoaster that each serie of the first season is. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s about enjoying your potatoes for breakfast, molding cats, exposed nipples, &quot;don&#039;t call me Kokoro-chan&quot; and such level of creativity that it puts Excel Saga to shame.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about the references; the most subtle ones which actually require some IQ (even though not as high as one of a certain character) and proper education to understand or an eagle eye to notice, and the most stupid ones, where you can unleash your inner Beavis and Butthead laugh.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about an eye candy, childish appearance with mature, sometimes borderline topics in almost each serie. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s about the fact that yes, you could find similar characters elsewhere, but they won&#039;t have the vibe you look for.  J.C. Staff did it again, you will never find another Osaka from Azumanga and you will never find another Sherlock Shellingford or Twenty from Milky Holmes.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about not paying attention to the low ratings; you know it&#039;s not a 7. It&#039;s not even a 10.<br />
It&#039;s Milky Holmes out of 10. It&#039;s all about mindset, a similar mindset.<br />
<br />
p.s. Bother less about the second season and don&#039;t bother at all about the rest; sadly, the team lost their Toys somewhere during that time and are yet to find them.

    So after a while i decided to write my first review for the most underrated anime i saw. Tantei Opera Milky Holmes.<br />
<br />
If i look at my scores 8 for story, 8 for art, 8 for sound. <br />
Its not really the animation or a great storyline which amazed me. The character are so funny to watch and the most important point for me was the &quot;enjoyment&quot;.<br />
<br />
I dont care if the arts bad, story boring and the sound annoying, but the jokes was so nice to watch, and the insider gags were so funny( ones you get it) that the enjoyment factor was at maximum for me.<br />
<br />
And

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34867">
        whats really special for me was that i dropped this anime once. After watching the 5 ep i started to watch something different. But suddenly somewhere near christmas i started to watch ep 6 and was so fascinated that i couldnt stop and watched all of them in one day.<br />
And the last ep was probably the most awesome last ep i saw. <br />
That was my little christmas miracle ^^<br />
<br />
And the hype didnt end, i read other blogs that they also fascinated about this awesome anime and even convince other to watch it and they didnt regret it. <br />
<br />
So to everyone who think this is a serie about little girls who fight bears, they are right but thats the charm of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes.

    I&#039;m honestly not sure what else to start with other than that I came to this show with expectations that I could watch lolies go on wacky adventures and solve strange cases. At the start I am greeted to the protagonists and the antagonists. The first five minutes prove to be very promising, with the characters losing their powers. I figured that they would have to use teamwork to move forward. What I got after that though was highly disappointing. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to be straight with you, one of things that got me through the first few episodes was the lolies, and even then, they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91063">
        weren&#039;t much on their own. I got the feeling that the creators thought that making the girls borderline retarded would make them more cute, sort of like the girls in K-on, mainly Yui. But the difference between the two casts is that at least the girls in K-on get good at what the set out to do. Yui get to be a good guitar player, and even though she acts it, she does get good grades when she puts her mind to it. The cast of Milky Holmes never really improved. At first I was appalled at the amount of discrimination the girls got simply for losing their powers. Those that lose their powers are called &quot;useless&quot;, and Milky Holmes was no exception. Supposedly the girls were famous and had solved many cases, but once their powers were lost, they were treated lower than dirt. I still held similar sentiments throughout the show, because they were expected to get their toys back when it was never proven that anybody had ever done that before. But most of it left because the girls really did tend to be useless, they hindered far more than helped. <br />
<br />
And this show really doesn&#039;t have a villain. This show is supposed to be lighthearted. We learn in the first episode that the Student Council President is Arsene, and her three henchmen have also all infiltraded the girl&#039;s school. One is a teacher, one a chef, and the other a fellow student. I will repeat this show really doesn&#039;t have a villain. To be honest, the &quot;villains&quot; were more interesting than the girls. I would guess Arsene enjoys the chase more than victory, because several of her plots are to help the girls get their powers and deep down she seems to have a good heart. Twenty, the teacher, is narcissistic to the point he carries around a dakimakura (hugging pillow) with himself on it.The chef dude (who&#039;s name eludes me) is usually serious, but he too tends to provide some comedy, and Rat, the student acts like a rival at times to the girls. The villains remind me a lot of Team Rocket. I felt that they were doing most of the work for making the show enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Speaking of enjoyment, I felt the first few episodes were poor, but it picked up in comedy after that, only to get more serious later on. This tended to create a clash I felt. As the story got more serious, the characters didn&#039;t really follow suit. I understand that if it had the girls would have seemed too different, but I felt as it was, they stood out and got in the way. The tone in the later episodes I felt didn&#039;t really work with the characters. The midsection of the series was definitely the best of them.<br />
<br />
I get that the show is suppose to be a parody of the detective genre, I think a parody itself would work, but what I got wasn&#039;t so much a parody of the detective genre, and more of k-on where the girls are supposed to be detectives. And it&#039;s a k-on where they suck at their job from beginning to end. At least the villains aren&#039;t so bad, otherwise the people would be doomed.<br />
<br />
The most memorable character and my favorite is Twenty. I really wanted it to be one of the lolies, but my favorite loli of the show, Irene, wasn&#039;t featured enough. Twenties antics just really stuck out, even amongst the other strange happenings from the cast. Like when he licked his dakimakura of himself, or when he frequently stripped in class, or best of all, one of his lines in episode 3. He was the star of the show if you ask me.

    When watching the first episode my first impression was that this anime was a children&#039;s anime on detectives and thief&#039;s, oh but how i was wrong. After watching more episodes i find that this series is definitely for older audiences especially when the teacher made his appearance. <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Whilst their is a plot half of the episodes are dedicated to pure randomness, this is to be expected of from a comedy series. Now to the main story line. This story revolves Sherlock and her friends and their mission to re-gain/ find their toys whilst also trying to arrest The Gentleman Thief Empire. This is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33387">
        plot that hasn&#039;t got much to it except that. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
I enjoyed the art style used for this anime. I like how each character is drawn and how they animated the some of the battle scenes. The background was nothing out of the ordinary which was a little disappointing but the character design made up for it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
I did like the choice of the theme music since I thought it fitted quite well with the story. My reason for saying that is because the opening (i think) was sung by the seiyuu&#039;s of the main four characters whilst the ending represented Lady Arsene in a way.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Each character had their well known personalities from Hercule and her shyness to Mr. Nijuuri who loves himself. Each character is definitely unique in their own way and great to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
This series was hilarious at most times, whilst at other times it bugged me especially whenever the episode revolved around Kokoro Akechi, she really bugged me because all she did was pull pranks on Milky Holmes that I didn&#039;t really find funny. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
This is a great series to add to your list since it is packed with a great amount of comedy. It was fun to watch and it had a great art style too. If you are the type who likes to watch anime where they&#039;re serious about the plot then i wouldn&#039;t recommend this to you since they love to joke around in this series alot. Overall a fantastic series.

    After ranting like crazy about the first episode when I first saw it, I never thought I would go back to finish the rest of it. But after hearing that it was nominated by Japanese fans as the best anime of 2010 (although Japanese fans do admittingly have some odd tastes in anime…) and hearing some good comments about it from the few people I knew that were watching the show, I figured going back and finishing the show couldn’t hurt. And I can say that, after watching this series, while it is the most underrated from the Fall season of 2010, it is by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34825">
        no means the best of the year. For a comedy, it was actually done rather well, and while it gets heavy in fanservice sometimes, this show turned out surprisingly better than I had expected.<br />
<br />
That being said, the key thing you need to realize when approaching this anime is that it’s pretty much just a huge parody about everything it touches upon. It parodies the detective-phantom thief dynamic (which Detective Conan is famous for), along with a ton of random jokes and video game parodies. I’ll admit that I didn’t get all the jokes, but the ones that I did understand were hilarious, or at least brought a smile to my face. If you start watching this show expecting anything other than slapstick comedy, be warned, you won’t find this show particularly enjoyable.<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice about some of the jokes, though, is that while some of the jokes were loaded with moe and cute laughter, the implications of the joke were actually quite a bit more serious. For example, when I saw that the main cast was OVERJOYED to be thrown into jail so that they could get a free meal, while the moment was funny I also thought “man, did they seriously just become happy by being thrown in jail?”. This happens quite a few times, such as when the starving, desperate protagonists decided to grill mushrooms that they harvested from the underside of their old, decrepit desk, so on so forth. I guess you could say that I was surprised by how there a few more serious implications to certain scenes than you would think for a moe comedy show. I don’t think this was done on purpose, but it’s still an interesting little thing to note.<br />
<br />
The main cast was a total mess, though I do think it was done that way on purpose. The story follows a group of four girls that have aspirations of becoming great detectives, but when they lose their superpowers (termed “toys” in this show), they become utterly useless. Like, seriously, they were probably the most incompetent, simple-minded, spoiled main cast I’ve seen in a long time.<br />
<br />
Spoiled in the sense that the main characters had become almost completely incompetent after they lost their powers, which just shows how over reliant they were on those powers. However, these negative traits were often used to comedic effect, which I thought was an interesting way to go about things. Some of the characters, although extremely lacking in any sort of proper character development, turned out rather charming to watch and got laughs out of me.<br />
<br />
The main story got rather repetitive quite a bit, but the main strength with the story was probably how it was executed. The story certainly tried to put some unconventional twists into whatever was happening, and while it wasn’t always successful, it was still quite good at keeping the viewer engaged in the happenings of the show. The pure ridiculousness of the events in the show, along with how this show never tries to really take itself seriously (as opposed to some often forced drama in other comedies), works out surprisingly better than I had thought it would.<br />
<br />
What was a bigger issue in this series was probably the production quality, which was very weak in the first episode, and mediocre throughout the rest of the series. Tantei Opera certainly will not be winning any sort of best animation awards, but JC staff still managed to pull through in the end.<br />
<br />
Overall, Tantei Opera was surprisingly better than expected, and did exactly what the creators meant to do; create a slapstick comedy with some absurd situations and characters, and nothing really beyond that. While I certainly don’t think this was the best comedy by any means, it certainly had a more unique execution with a bunch of it’s jokes. I can see why people say this is the most underrated show from Fall 2010 outside of Japan. While this show certainly isn’t for everybody, and the fanservice may turn some people off from this show, Tantei Opera has it’s own merits and strengths that make it a rather entertaining show in it’s own right.<br />
<br />
Production Quality: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
Characters: 8.0/10<br />
<br />
Story: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
Setting: 7.0/10<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: 7.5/10 (Rounded up to a 8 on MAL)<br />

    Admittedly I ended up watching &quot;Tantei Opera Milky Holmes&quot; due to a clip I saw on the internet which was sourced to this anime. In other words, I went in with literally zero expectations.<br />
<br />
The ride was definitely a bumpy one.<br />
<br />
A short summary of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes would be something along the lines of: A cute and somewhat entertaining little anime, that has a tendency to be about as non-sensical and generic as can be. If you want a good storyline, good characters and a satisfying ending, you&#039;ll definitely want to look elsewhere. If you want a whacky, zaney and non-sensical anime with cute girls,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review110817">
        please stay and read on  - But prepare to hit the off-switch on your analytical brain however, because this show makes no sense.<br />
<br />
The story itself is not something that is going to blow your mind. It is straightforward, is cemented from episode one and onwards and doesn&#039;t really take any twists and turns down the line. The story works for the anime and its cast, but other than that it really doesn&#039;t deserve any particular spotlighting.<br />
<br />
The art is mediocre at best. What I mean by this, is that while certainly not bad or lacking in any means, it is also not particularly beautiful, fluid or unique. Colourful is about the only real compliment I can give it. That being said, it doesn&#039;t take anything away from the viewing experience either.<br />
<br />
The sound averages out at a &quot;fitting, but forgettable&quot;. It certainly won&#039;t be a distraction whilst watching, but it certainly won&#039;t stand out to you either. I wish I had more to say here, but the soundtrack really is forgettable. Both the opening and the ending are bland, and I&#039;d dare say they&#039;re borderline bad.<br />
<br />
The characters is where Tantei Opera Milky Holmes starts pulling a bit ahead of the other anime in the deep moeblob ocean. The main cast is about as generic as they come, with your token airhead, tomboy, quiet bashful girl of course the &quot;semi-responsible&quot; girl. It is the &quot;villains&quot; however, that add some flavour to it all. The &quot;Gentleman Thief Empire&quot;, made up by the four Phantom Thieves: Twenty, Rat, Stone River and Arséne are downright hilarious to observe at times and the banter between the main cast and this group of Phantom Thieves is surprisingly very entertaining.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fellow &quot;Fighting-for-good&quot; group of the show &quot;Genius 4&quot;, who despite being on the same side as Milky Holmes end up in constant arguments and fights with each other.<br />
<br />
It is this character interaction, combined with the shows tendency to pull completely over-the-top and ridiculous scenarios out of its pocket, that allows Tantei Opera Milky Holmes to pull ahead of the curve, even if it is by a tiny amount.<br />
<br />
Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is generic and downright stupid for the most part, but still somehow manages to string together an interesting mix of characters, earning it a decent 6/10.<br />
<br />
<br />

    First impression &amp; Bias:<br />
Oh dear god. This show threw me for a ride. It took me a few episodes before I realized the kids genre was removed on MAL. I was sort of puzzled by the stripping male teacher who would pinch his nipples. Well despite that oddity, this show is definitely a stupidly fun show. Why? It has nothing to do with mysteries, special powers, or anything pertaining to the story. It is nothing more than the adventures for a group of girls to attempt to regain what they once had only to fail humorously.<br />
Expectation: 5<br />
Episode Scores: -,-,-,8,6,8,7,7,7,6,8,8<br />
Actual: 7 (Good)<br />
<br />
Analysis:<br />
Starting up with a quote

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33241">
        from the episode discussions, &quot;This show is dumb in all the right ways.&quot; This sums up a lot. Extremely episodic, with happy art, and a tale of how the good guys and bad guys coexist as friends and rivals at the same time. Our queen of thieves miraculously seals away the toys of the great Milky Holmes detective group by accident, and at a loss without them goes undercover as the detective academy student body president. Her goal? To try and restore them to their glory of course, but they will say they just want to humiliate them. Her assistants also join the work force there, or rather they are able to because of the extreme idiocy of the cast. How the group was ever great is beyond me, for they cannot even figure out the identity even when they change her into her costume. Yup, has to be cosplay of course.<br />
 Yet the misfortune of the Holmes group is very enjoyable, and there are a few good adult humor jokes that were good just because they seemed out of place. Indeed, it may be that the odd expectations I had allowed me to enjoy what I would usually see as average humor. Yet, I think that the comedy in this show is not bad even in hindsight. There is rarely any actual detective work in this show, as the powers allow the detectives to function more as police trying to apprehend the suspect rather than solve who it is. In actuality, the times where they attempt to incorporate detective work is when the show is at its worst.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
There is not much to say about Milky Holmes. Offering a pretty good comedic value, and requiring little brain use to enjoy it with the show exceeded my expectations. I give this a solid Good out of 10.<br />
<br />
Sequel: Would watch!<br />

    Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is about the conflict of two opposing sides: detectives and phantom thieves. They are both bestowed with amazing powers called Toys and they fight beautifully in the dead of night.<br />
That&#039;s what the intro wants you to believe, but that&#039;s not really the case. More than anything, it&#039;s about four useless idiot detectives tripping over each other. <br />
I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s called Milky Holmes, either, but I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s just something they thought sounded good in 2010.<br />
<br />
The Milky Holmes are descendants of famous detectives and were themselves supposedly famous before the series started, but now they&#039;ve lost their powers and became

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403483">
        completely useless. <br />
We don&#039;t really get to see them be good at anything and they don&#039;t seem to acually have the personalities or the intellectual abilities of their ancestors, so we never get the feel for them ever being impressive in any way.<br />
They go to Holmes Detective Academy where they used to live in luxurious rooms until all that was taken away from them after they&#039;ve lost their powers. Now they&#039;re reduced to living in a dirty, moldy attic and eating at the most neglected table in the caffeteria, where they can get a boiled potato each, at most.<br />
A lot of the humor is derived from the girls being put in miserable situations like this, but they mostly remain positive (except maybe Cordelia) about it and they&#039;re idiots, anyway, so it never feels too malicious and remains funny.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no real story or change or character development throughout the whole season: it&#039;s all just ridiculous episodic plots that don&#039;t matter by the end of the episode and, even though it&#039;s about detectives, there isn&#039;t really much mystery solving, either.<br />
Most episodes are about the Milky Holmes running into some kind of trouble or trying to find a way to get their powers back. I&#039;m fine with that, because those episodic plots can be pretty funny and the main characters are good enough to carry the show, but it would definitely be a better series if something did change from time to time.<br />
My favourite episodes are among the craziest ones: the one where they get lost in the forest and the one where Sherlock switches places with a princess who happens to looks exactly like her. Other than those, most episodes are fine, but there are a few straight up boring ones.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters are likeable, even though a lot of them don&#039;t get anything to do and aren&#039;t extremely memorable. I do love the four main characters and really enjoy their dynamic, though. They&#039;re entertaining and you want to see them succeed, even though they very rarely achieve anything.<br />
Sherlock is happy go lucky and possibly the dumbest one of the bunch, Nero is tomboyish, eats a lot and has a short fuse, Hercule is the least interesting character, since her only traits are being quiet and shy, while <br />
Cordelia is probably the most interesting among them. She&#039;s used to a life of luxury and when she&#039;s forced to live in poverty, she can&#039;t handle it. As soon as something goes wrong, she starts disassociating and can turn into a maniac at the blink of an eye. Her outbursts made me both laugh and feel sorry for her at the same time. She&#039;s also obsessed with cleanliness and often fantasizes about the Holmes being the ideal team that always gets along, but that rarely happens in real life.<br />
<br />
Other than them, there&#039;s Arsene, the phantom thief who gets the plot going by taking away the Milky Holmes&#039; powers. She&#039;s just watching over the Milky Holmes most of the time and her motivations remain somewhat unclear to me.<br />
In tow, she has a misfit band of phantom thieves who follow her blindly, among which Twenty is the most entertaining. <br />
He&#039;s a narcissistic pervert who loves himself way too much and has a running joke of taking his clothes off and exposing his grotesquely long nipples. <br />
The other two aren&#039;t very interesting and they mostly just fawn over Arsene or serve as straight men to Twenty or the Milky Holmes.<br />
<br />
The final group of characters are the Genius 4, who are a kind of police force for capturing phantom thieves. I don&#039;t really know what the difference between them and the detectives is and why they both exist, because that&#039;s never explained.<br />
Among them, the most prominent character is their leader, Kokoro, a typical example of an angry, spiteful, but dumb and useless loli, who is still entertaining.<br />
The other G4 characters seem interesting, but don&#039;t have much going on. You can make out what their personalities are supposed to be, but they don&#039;t do a whole lot.<br />
<br />
The opening is great, featuring a really catchy song and fun visuals, while the ending is okay, mostly being still images of the characters in somewhat compromising positions. The ending song is pretty catchy, too, but I found myself skipping it more often than not.<br />
<br />
Aside from three or four episodes, the animation isn&#039;t anything special and the art is good enough throughout the series, being appropriately cute or deranged, depending on what is needed at the moment.<br />
<br />
The last episode of the season was extremely disappointing and had me questioning if the other seasons are just the same thing all over again.<br />
The first season was entertaining, but I don&#039;t want to just watch the same thing again and that&#039;s the main reason why I&#039;m not exactly rushing to continue watching the series.<br />
This season was entertaining enough that I could see myself getting back into it in a few months&#039; time, though, once I get a craving for braindead nonsense again.
