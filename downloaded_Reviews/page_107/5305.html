    Death Note is easily one of the most popular and instantly recognisable anime out there, currently sitting at the number one spot here on MAL for the number of members it has. It&#039;s a show that has been referenced and parodied time and time again by fans of the show, as well as in other anime. However, Renai Boukun, otherwise known as Love Tyrant, takes it a step further by making an entire show a parody of Death Note itself! And it&#039;s completely mediocre, with forced and bland comedy that becomes stale incredibly quickly, a lacklustre cast of characters while, at the same time, hardly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250679">
        doing anything with its set-up or parody elements. I honestly really wanted to like this, I really did, but each passing episode became even more incredibly bland and dull than the last resulting in an end product that most people will forget in only a couple of months and leaving me with a feeling of genuine disappointment. <br />
<br />
As I just mentioned, the show is essentially a parody of the series Death Note, but in this instance, the Death Note is now replaced with a new book called the Kiss Note; an extremely powerful tool that, when two names are written inside it next to each other, they will both fall madly in love with each other regardless of the gender, providing that they kiss one another that is. This feature, in particular, comes greatly in use for the yaoi enthusiast,  Guri, a hyperactive idiot cupid whose task is to match up potential couples with each other. However, she accidentally writes the main protagonist&#039;s name in the book, by the name of Seiji Anno, and he has to kiss someone otherwise Guri will die (which we later learn is an outright lie). He decides to kiss his crush, who turns out to have a mad obsession with our bland as hell main character here, bordering on Yandere tendencies, pulling out random knives and swords from her tits in the same way a girl may keep her phone down there or something? They eventually do kiss, but Guri makes herself, and Yandere-chan, known as Akane, into a three-way relationship, eventually adding Akane&#039;s sister,  Yuzu (who actually loves Akane) into the mix. And that&#039;s pretty much it for an overall narrative, which, I believe is fine for a comedy anime as long as the characters are fun and the comedy is funny and varied, which, unfortunately, is something I believe the anime lacks.<br />
<br />
For starters, let&#039;s discuss the wasted potential in the Death Note parody gimmick and set-up of the narrative. Despite being a parody of said series, Love Tyrant hardly utilises the Kiss Note to any substantial merit and the show pretty much forgets about this item throughout much of the duration, which, in my eyes, is wasted potential for some comedic moments. It feels like the Kiss Note was added as a way to make the show more marketable by riding on the popularity of Death Note, rather than being used as satire. There is no clever meta-commentary or callbacks to the actual series either, so the Kiss Note, aside from being used to start the story, feels inconsequential and rather pointless to boot. Not only that, but the comedy, for the most part, feels incredibly weak and trite despite the potential in the first two episode. I&#039;ll honestly admit, that the first two episodes of Love Tyrant are actually pretty funny and engaging to boot; I was having a great time with the show. The jokes, at the beginning anyway, felt fresh and they often were more hit than miss, but, as the show progresses, it feels more tiring to watch since they never switch up the dynamics and repeat the same jokes throughout. This makes the show feel so damn repetitive to watch, and repeating the same jokes is essentially a cardinal sin in comedy; it becomes stale by episode five! In addition, the jokes and comedy itself feels extremely forced and most jokes can be seen a mile away before they&#039;re even delivered! It doesn&#039;t help all too much either that the characters have hardly any chemistry with one another nor do their personalities bounce off each other well either.<br />
<br />
For the sake of argument, let&#039;s compare it to another comedy this year, from the previous season, called Gabriel Dropout. While that show is not a comedic masterpiece or anything, it was able to remain a fun ride throughout since its characters had defined personalities which had chemistry with one another, while, at the same time, spicing things up just enough with its joke variations to keep things from becoming too stale. This doesn&#039;t happen in this show and each joke feels as bland as the last. There is no snowball effect taking place, nor are the character&#039;s personalities strong enough to carry the weight of the show. The comedic timing could also feel pretty off, and often at times jarring! The problem with the show is that it doesn&#039;t quite know if it wants to be a comedy, a drama or an edge-fest and combines them all together, with an end result that feels clunky to watch. It&#039;s not necessarily uncommon for anime to combine multiple genres together, but here there is hardly any downtime between any of the events, so in one moment they are laughing and joking, and in the immediate next, the main character is being tortured. There is no downtime between any of these events and thus it can feel really awkward and jarring while watching the show since the pacing for this show is strangely inconsistent, but is normally pumped up to eleven at all times. Again, for the sake of argument, Gintama is also an anime that features a lot of comedy intermixed with more serious and emotional moments, but, in that show, these two never feel all too intrusive on each other since there is a good amount of downtime between each one. Perhaps this is an unfair comparison considering the sheer difference in the lengths of both shows, but there are plenty of other shows that can achieve this, so why not this one?<br />
<br />
This doesn&#039;t help when the music for the show is so badly implemented and placed at the worst of times. One of the worst examples comes from episode eight in which the main character is being continuously stabbed with a sharp object, while light and carefree music is being played over it, music that would fit right at home in children&#039;s shows. It just feels, yet again, jarring, and that&#039;s the best word I can use to describe this show: jarring.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters, they don&#039;t fare much better. The main character is as boring in personality as he is in visual design. He plays the typical main character lead; spiky hair, getting embarrassed when a girl gets close to him, and so on and so forth. He is a rather boring character, who is pushed into playing the straight man role for the group and nothing else beyond that. He responds with the typical reactions you&#039;d expect from a character in his position and jumps in to save the day whenever he is needed to do so. He is not a bad character necessarily, just an extremely dull one. Akane has a little bit more going for her, in that we do actually learn her back-story, which does explain the reason behind her action and general personality, details I can appreciate, it&#039;s just that each scenario and joke she is in, always is about how she is a yandere, while, at the same time, pulling out weapons from her tits. While beautiful in her visual appearance, her character doesn&#039;t really have all too much in likeability nor does she receive all too much development as a person either, aside from her rebellion against her mother in the eighth episode of the show. Yuzu receives a little bit of exploration into her character and reasoning behind her love for Akane, while, at the same time having superpowers (which the show never actually explains why she has those now that I am thinking about it) but, again, it feels like I&#039;m repeating myself here, needed more in the way of development in order for her character to be good. The only character I liked was Guri, mainly because I have a soft spot for his aloof idiot types of characters, but I generally found her to be kind of charming in her own little way. I liked her character design perhaps the most, and the various facial expressions she did were kind of funny in their own little way, although nothing remarkable as a whole. <br />
<br />
If there is one thing I can praise, it is the artwork and general look of the show. It is very colourful and pops pretty well, and, as I said, I liked the various faces and chibi-ness of some of the facial expressions too. I also liked the opening and ending tracks, especially the opening which is incredibly catchy. It&#039;s upbeat, lively and full of energy, which, the rest of the show should have been as well, which is a shame since it did have a few things going for it. Some of the comedic moments were alright and the initial set up was good, but unfortunately, the show was not funny in my eyes. <br />
<br />
But this is where it becomes difficult, however. Comedy is something that is extremely subjective, and thus, I can imagine many people finding this show very funny to watch, which is completely fine. After all, many people consider the second season of Konosuba to be weaker than its prequel, yet I found it funny still, which is something I have to consider when talking about comedy. My sense of humour is pretty damn strange, and I find pleasure in absurd humour. On that end, I would like to recommend this show, on account that you personally may find it funny to watch, but, on the flip side, there are so many other comedy anime out there that take the time to write much more varied jokes that don&#039;t come across as forced or jarring when they switch to a more serious tone. It&#039;s unfortunate that I didn&#039;t enjoy this show, since, as I said in the opening paragraph, I really did want to like this show, but I just couldn&#039;t...<br />

    *No spoiler review*<br />
TL;DR: A deconstructed school harem rom-com parody that is actually quite fun to watch if you are ready for a Love Octagon of epic proportion. The humour never dies, the seriousness never shines. The love comes and goes &amp; the parody just flows. <br />

What do you get if you give the power of something serious as &quot;Kiss Note&quot; (similar to Death Note but kissing) to a clueless cupid who just wants to use it to make her wildest fantasies come true? You get a deconstructed rom-com parody that somehow keeps you watching for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250680">
        more. This show never takes itself seriously and frankly it&#039;s because of this that this show shines as a whole. In Renai Boukun aka Love Tyrant, a Kiss Note (parody of Death Note) is a powerful notebook that makes people who have their names written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other, regardless of any circumstances. If they don&#039;t… they will remain a virgin forever and c&#039;mon which person would want that? Enter Guri, a cupid clueless about Love, accidentally writes Seiji&#039;s (MC) name mistaking him for someone else. She shows up to his door, explains the concept to him, they kiss, and the problem begins from there. This whole show starts off from this tiny snowball of a problem that just keeps rolling down the hill and it gets just bigger and bigger. Quite a rollercoaster ride if you ask me. <br />
<br />
Before I get into the plot, it&#039;s the characters that makes this show so enjoyable. You have Guri, a BL obsessed undere cupid who is clueless about love. Then, Akane, a psychotic beautiful yandere, that will kill anyone that touches her love. Cue in Yuzu, a tsundere wincestual stalker, in love with her step-sister. Next the cousin of Akane &amp; Yuzu, Shikami, a sado-maso mayadere who gets off on pain, obsessed with stealing other&#039;s love. On the side, you have the MC&#039;s younger sister Akua, a kuudere with severe brother/sister complex hoping for her brother&#039;s love. Finally, you have the weak &amp; pathetic yet kind MC, Seiji, who is &quot;not handsome, quick to anger, stubborn, insensitive and just a really boring guy&quot; wanting to find true love. Throw them all in one pot, thanks to the supernatural power of &quot;Kiss Note&quot;, you have a chaotic mess that will deliver enough comedy to keep you watching for more. Seriously, the characters all feel unique and though the point isn&#039;t for viewers to identify themselves as one of the character in the show, you just can&#039;t help laughing at each of their hilarity. Even the Kami, aka God, and Maoh, aka Devil, are presented in such comedic manner that the only less outrageous character in this show is the MC himself. You really do start to pity him seeing the stuff he gets himself into. Despite all the chaos, each of the characters actually undergoes some form of character development to better their personality. Now that you have a better grasp of the characters and their &quot;goals&quot;, let&#039;s dive into the plot. <br />
<br />
Plot wise, the story sort of follows a linear pattern as the show is supposed to showcase Guri&#039;s coming of age story as she becomes a better Cupid who will succeed Kami in the future by truly understanding the concept of love. However, this show isn&#039;t about reaching that destination, it&#039;s about enjoying the messed up journey these characters gets themselves into. At its essence, this is a parody that deconstructs the rom-com genre by showing how obscure the concept of school love is by portraying it through a comedic lense. Each episode is a two part episode where the characters find themselves in stereotypical harem/rom-com messy situations that gets resolved by the end after poking much needed fun at its obscurities. The constant juxtaposition of presenting different deretype characters really adds to its comedic value, plus the dialogues go from corny to cheesy to somewhat deep at times. It&#039;s almost as if the director snaps their fingers at the viewers to tell them, &quot;sssh, serious matters are being shown here… or so we think.&quot; Seriously, the best part about this show is that neither the plot nor the director takes the show seriously which allows for the &quot;quit pro quo&quot; comedic style to flourish so well. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the animation team behind Renai Boukun did a great job. Each of the major characters stand out from one another and they made the MC a very relatable looking character that is both bland yet unique looking. The use of bold vibrant primary colours really shines throughout the anime. It is able to contrast the deep satirical emotions of love with the outrageous comedic elements of chaos. Though scattered if observed individually but seems cohesive when seen together. The OP song is quirky &amp; catchy and the ED song is nice but its the OST that really shines as it helps the anime flow well with the story by constantly aiding in the creation and diffusion of tension. Definitely worth a listen as a standalone. <br />
<br />
Overall, Renai Boukun is a fun show to watch, not just on a whim. It&#039;s a good parody and it never takes itself seriously so the comedy never dies. I enjoyed watching it despite not being a fan of rom-com because it is a deconstructed parody of this genre. If you are debating whether or not you want to watch the show, just ask yourself this. Do you want to watch a show that is utter madness due to hilarious characters? Do you enjoy good comedy? Do you like a bit of fan service? Regardless of yes or no, you should watch this show. Simple as that... joking. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it. <br />
<br />
P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!<br />
P.P.S. &quot;What is love? It&#039;s not about knowing what love is… being in love means whether you are happy or sad the heart always aches for that one special person&quot;

    **You will not find any spoilers in my review**<br />
<br />
I felt the need to express my initial feelings toward the series:<br />
<br />
Renai Boukun parodies of Death Note. Given that it&#039;s a parody, expect some over-the-top humor displayed through unrealistic situations. It doesn&#039;t, by any means, take itself serious: This casual anime is simply one that contains some light-hearted humor. In addition, it contains yuri, yaoi fandom, and the yandere archetype, in case you&#039;re a fan of one of those three. (It has more yandere--and a super obvious form of it--than the other two.)<br />
<br />
I would have to say the production (story, art, sound, etc.) is pretty standard for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246450">
        being 2017. It&#039;s neither a piece of art nor is it sub-par in quality. We&#039;ll see if it continues to deliver as its story develops. If nothing else, Renai Boukun has the rare yandere archetype and is a parody of the most popular anime on MyAnimeList. (I mean, it really boggles my mind how no one has yet parodied Death Note since it&#039;s been out for over 10 years.) Renai Boukun got my interest.

Story:<br />
When thinking of this show, the word wacky comes to mind. We&#039;re introduced to characters that fit their &quot;niche,&quot; if you will, but with a slight spin on it. They are basically forced together with the end result of their shenanigans being rather bizarre at times. This comedy follows the job of a cupid and the troubles that go along with it. With that said, it may be repetitive here and there which brings the show down overall. However, one of my biggest problems with the show is that the story itself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250685">
        quickly goes downhill somewhere midway when Guri is basically forced to find love for the sake of &quot;developing&quot; her character; the way it was brought about was rather sudden and obvious in intention. As if the romance wasn&#039;t stiff enough as it is. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I do enjoy the ever-present theme of &quot;good vs. bad&quot; within the show; to be more precise, angels vs. demons. It really plays off the characters really well, and I think it was a great setup. For instance, our &quot;antiheroine&quot; Akane comes from an assassin family skilled with swords while her half-sister&#039;s family offers protection in the form of a shield, or rather, a barrier. Likewise, we can say the same thing towards Seiji&#039;s sister - being on the good side - and Shikimi - being on the bad side. Interestingly enough, Guri is a living and breathing oxymoron herself. She&#039;s an angel, yet she loves to stir up trouble every so often. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The exaggeration of the characters&#039; actions brings home the idea that this anime should not be taken too seriously. It&#039;s really more for entertainment value, rather than being realistic. From the faces they make to the times they should have &quot;died,&quot; the art makes sure to convey a comedic tone to it. Much to my surprise, it does a decent job of balancing out the tone in critical points. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
This department was pretty lackluster, admittedly. While it fits the general atmosphere, it&#039;s not exactly something you would want to listen to by itself. It has a somewhat quirky feel and generally compliments the show. Overall, it definitely gets the job done when it needs to, even if it&#039;s half-heartedly.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Probably the most disappointing aspect of the show. It&#039;s a comedy, and I get that; they are funny in their own way. Although, that&#039;s not necessarily a good reason to cling to when they get so predictable early on. After a first impression or two, it&#039;s pretty obvious to see that Akane is a yandere, Guri is a carefree spirit, Seiji is clueless, Yuzu is obsessive, Shikimi is sadistic, and Akua is a tsundere. It&#039;s not exactly original. There may be some character development here and there - which is great - but then why does it go back to being redundant almost immediately afterwards? The change is definitely there, but it&#039;s just extremely hard to tell sometimes. More often than not, it&#039;s stagnant. While the characters did bring a smile to my face once in a while, I would not go so far to say that they have depth. <br />
<br />
To summarize, it&#039;s an entertaining show. I would recommend it to anime fans that are looking for something... &quot;peculiar.&quot; Despite the things it does right, it&#039;s just not my cup of tea. From my perspective, there were more negatives that outweighed the positives. As a whole, I would say it&#039;s pretty unoriginal yet amusing at best. You can interpret that however you wish. <br />
<br />
Final score: 3/10.

    Love is weird.  On one hand, you can fall head over heels for your partner, but you could also want to dig your fingers into their throat because of how annoying they can be.  I hope not every relationship is like that, but it can and has happened.  Through it all, love can be hilarious due to how nonsensical the concept it can be when you put it in perspective.  So why does it matter anyway?  Well to Renai Boukun (aptly titled ‘Love Tyrant’), it means a lot.  <br />
<br />
Story: Aino Seiji is just your typical harem protagonist.  Nice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250684">
        to everyone, easygoing, and comes into contact with a plethora of very troublesome women through very unfortunate circumstances.  After coming into contact with a girl who presents him with a “Kiss Note” (Yes, it’s a death note reference.  Don’t think too hard about it), he is brought into the realm of couple-making where he must help couples get together, all the while dealing with a small trail of women himself.<br />
<br />
This show is in a word, rushed.  Smashing together about forty or so chapters of the original manga into a twelve-episode anime, the story for Renai Boukun follows the story of a hyperactive fujoshi, a shrill, incestuous stalker, a kukuri wielding yandere, and the main protagonist, as they come across various, loosely love-based scenarios that culminate into…something.  When looking at it from face value, it’s quite unclear to understand what it is the show wants to be.  <br />
<br />
Aside from the overall theme of love and how love exists in various kinds of romantic relationships, the show zip zaps around from being one-off episode comedy plots, to one-two episode long drama plots involving one of the main characters.  Due to the rushed nature of trying to get to the end, the show suffers from poor comedic timing, as the necessary time to let the audience breathe from in-between jokes is absent and thus makes it very difficult for the audience to really get a full kick out of what we’re supposed to laugh at.  Not only that, it doesn’t help that the show relies mostly on repeated gags in order to try and be funny either.<br />
<br />
Another problem is character development.  Due to the fact that the show attempts to squeeze so much in so little, any and all character development that the show tries to accomplish feels contrived and stiff.  Two of the main girls in particular get arcs dedicated to them, and it doesn’t really feel like they accomplish much of anything in the end because we’re given less than hour each of total focus to even give a crap.  The ending doesn’t really help either cause things are more or less thrown back into the status quo of things, so I guess like some aspects of life, some things never change.<br />
<br />
Overall, the story of Renai Boukun is a mess of fragments broken off from an existing manga shoddily put back together to try to create some semblance of an anime.  A lot of the in-between details are missing and while the show does tell a story in the end, it doesn’t really feel genuine or rewarding because the journey watching these characters feels so half-hearted.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
-  TERRIBLE pacing (Some episodes are one chapter.  Others are three-four.)<br />
-  Poor comedic timing<br />
-  Contrived character development<br />
<br />
Characters:  If I’ll give the show anything, it’s that its main cast is…something.  It’s something all right.<br />
<br />
First off, we have Aino Seiji.  Now I don’t know why this guy is our protagonist of all characters, but I safely say that he is as bland as they come.  Seiji is your typical ‘nice’ protagonist: respects women, nice to all, easygoing, and most of all, dense.  Maybe he’s not that last one so much, but the rest for sure.  The most interesting part about his character I’d say is how he at least acknowledges the affection he gets from the girls (At least one of them) and has the willingness to be a kind soul regardless of the situation.  Which honestly is something you have to give to the guy considering his harem is filled with absolutely terrible people, deals with haphazardly stupid situations daily, and he gets blamed for stupid shit when his involvement in things aren’t always his fault anyway.  Beyond that, he’s about as interesting as a saltine cracker.  <br />
<br />
Then there’s Guri.  I want to separate this one from the rest of the harem specifically because she is the cause of everyone’s problems.  Noted previously as the ‘hyperactive fujoshi’ who likes to cosplay, Guri doesn’t understand love, yet does whatever she wants because she’s a free spirit and can’t be held down by any form of convention so long as it’s fun and whatnot.  This can be a good archetype, except the show makes her really, really annoying.  For the most part, she causes a lot of the series’ conflicts (she’s the one that jumpstarted the plot anyway), leaving Seiji in particular to try and fix some things.  She’s just…not a very good character, especially since the ending tries its best to get the audience to care about her when the show up until that point gives us very little reason to give a damn in the first place.<br />
<br />
Then there’re the two half-sisters, Yuzu and Akane.  Yuzu shares similar problems with Guri, with most of her gags and annoyances coming off as creepy yuri as she jealously tries to garner the attention of her ‘onee-sama’ when in reality Akane gives little shits about her half-sister’s attention.  Yuzu’s whole saga throughout the series is all over the place and lacks enough cohesion to warrant any form of sympathy or care from the audience.  As for Akane, she acts as the series’ mediator while also being batshit crazy herself.  Carrying kukuri knives and comically threatening anyone who gets in the way of her and Seiji, Akane is surprisingly the most level-headed member of the entire female cast as she carries a lot of reasoning and understanding that most of the girls in this series lack.  Of course she does share her own fair share of problems (like having her arc be completely rushed to the point it didn’t even really matter), but in comparison, she fares so much better than the other girls in the series.<br />
<br />
Beyond them, the sidecast involves various family members of the characters’ families (who are also all crazy might I add) that add to some of the arcs in various ways with similarly varying degrees of success, a bunch of cast members who provide their own one-off love stories to help fill up the runtime and provide a different kind of romantic relationship, and the rapey penguin.  Yes, you read that right.  Why he’s there, I don’t know, but he has a surprisingly large part (by supporting cast standards) in this series so…that’s there, I guess.  (There’s also the character ‘Shikimi’, but we don’t talk about her and how much of a bitch she is.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Some level-headed characters<br />
-  Most of the cast is crazy (and not the good kind)<br />
-  Rapey penguin?  (Don’t know if this is necessarily a bad thing, but I’m adding it.)<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by EMT^2, Renai Boukun’s art is what I would describe as lazy.  The colors are blindingly bright to the point that it looks uncomfortable to watch; background characters are usually just gray silhouettes, and the characters just look gaudy with how the colors used on them are.  <br />
<br />
It’s not even just the art.  The animation for some scenes clearly show little effort is put into them, thus giving off this really cheap, cost-efficient look to the whole thing that looks very uninteresting to look at.  Not only that, but character designs have their own sets of problems.  Personally I find Yuzu’s hair very irritating to look at.  The huge pigtails on her sides combined with the cheap looking animation make her look like an eyesore every time she came on-screen.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
-  Lazy, cheap looking art<br />
<br />
Sound:  The OP known as…&quot;Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!” (Lord that’s a mouthful) is a poppy, upbeat song that actually fits well with the show’s wacky and comedic story.  Sure it’s just a pop idol girl song, but it has merit to it for having a unique beat to it so that it’s not just some generic anime opening that sounds similar to heaps of other openings from other shows.<br />
<br />
Its ED, &#039;Suki&#039; wo Oshiete’ on the other hand isn’t so fortunate.  Comparatively, it’s not really all that unique and falls into a generic sounding song that while sounds good, doesn’t really have much in the way of memorabilia so that you would want to listen to it again, and not so you have to loop it in the background so you can accurately come up with the words to describe it.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Decent tracks<br />
-  Ed isn’t really all that memorable<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  Having read the Renai Boukun manga, the adaptation disappointed me for not only not being on the same level as the original, but for rushing so much to get to a certain point in the story that it had to sacrifice so much just to get there.  As such, I had a really hard time finding many positives to say since not only was the plot not that stellar to begin with, it actually got worse because it was adapted into something with a limited time frame.  As such, my enjoyment with this series dipped down a bit, and I really wish it didn’t.  Because I did kind of enjoy just being forced to go along with the flow of things sometimes cause like the MC, there’s really no other way out of it.<br />
<br />
Did I like this series?  <br />
<br />
There were a few choice moments I’m glad they animated.  Not only that, but I’m glad Akane mostly stayed intact.  Despite her obsessive nature, she’s the series’ main voice of reason and maintains her sensibility (mostly) throughout the show despite the random shit going on around her. <br />
<br />
What didn’t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious plot problems, the rest of the girls in the main group: Guri, Yuzu, (and Shikimi, technically) really irk me.  Their archetypes to me are actually really unlikeable because not only do they center around one thing, which is being annoying, they do it so persistently throughout the series that it never feels like they have any kind of growth to them that would warrant me to like them.  There’s almost no change with their characters and it upsets me that in a harem series of all things, there are very few candidates for ‘best girl’.  (Not like any of them really are stellar choices.)<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
If you are going to watch this, turn your brain off.  Your enjoyment will skyrocket if you do.  Beyond that, this really isn’t something worth recommending.  Its plethora of problems with its pacing and characters combined with a really cheap looking animation style make Renai Boukun a really difficult watch.  Coupled with poor comedic timing and a newbie seiyuu for Yuzu whose voice grates the ears, I honestly have a hard time finding many redeeming merits for this show to watch.  I’d say read the manga if anything, but even then it’s best to turn the good ol’ noggin off.

Disclaimer<br />
----------<br />
The following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!<br />
<br />
---------<br />
Positives<br />
---------<br />
- Ridiculous Fun<br />
Renai Boukun is the classic example of a show that doesn&#039;t try and take itself too seriously. Its parodic intro to the show (with the &quot;Love Note&quot; parody) is a fittingly silly,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250688">
        tongue-in-cheek, and completely not subtle icon that symbolizes the whole show. The concept is crazy, the characters are ridiculous, and the hijinks they get up to are top notch. Additionally, there are many references and parodic elements that keep the energy going in the right direction.<br />
<br />
- Support Structure Story<br />
Direct romances and the underlying romantic story as a whole are not spectacular, but they also do not take away from the show in the slightest. They act as a nice underlying current that runs confidently beneath the shenanigans pushed to the forefront. There&#039;s no needlessly contrived plot points or backstory, just ones that are handled quickly. As if to say: &quot;Look, this isn&#039;t the focus of the show, but that doesn&#039;t mean we were going to slack off on it&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Charming Characters<br />
Renai Boukun&#039;s core production strength is its ability to recognize exactly what to emphasize. While I&#039;ve already mentioned its ridiculous comedy, the conduit to this comedy (the characters and their interactions) is arguably even more important. The characters were varied, yet equally ridiculous and the MC, Seiji-kun, was a good straight man to the rest of the show&#039;s goofy ways. Each of the main/major side characters felt sufficiently fleshed out for a 12 episode season, without feeling burdened with unnecessary fluff that could take away from the show&#039;s core feeling.<br />
<br />
- Matching Art Style<br />
The artistic style of the show does a fantastic job of not only contributing to the over-the-top moments of the show, but also serves as a very nice visual in between those times. There is a clear emphasis on popping colours and shining characters, which is exactly what a show like this should be pushing to the front.<br />
<br />
- Excellent OP<br />
This OP hits all the right points for me. Catchy music, character introductions, and a perfect set-up for the show you&#039;re about to watch. Never skipped it once, and it always got me in a &quot;Renai Boukun&quot; sort of mood.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
Negatives<br />
---------<br />
- Good, Not Great<br />
One of the disadvantages of pushing a few themes to the very forefront is that you leave some other elements behind. Let me be clear: Renai Boukun&#039;s overall story, character backgrounds, and world building are far from bad. They are adequate. As I mentioned above, this is to keep the comedy and madness at a high for as long as possible, but if you&#039;re looking for deep lore, complex characters, or an uber compelling romance plot, you won&#039;t find it here.<br />
<br />
- Kissed Potential<br />
The show&#039;s introductory episode was brilliant, and its roots in parody-ing &quot;Death Note&quot; with its counterpart, the &quot;Kiss Note&quot;, was incredibly compelling and a great tool to get the characters in a wealth of kooky conundrums. Where the show goes wrong is where it throws that concept aside about halfway through the season. It leads to a generally disjointed feeling to the arc, as it takes back seat to slightly more serious arcs for each of the main girls. I wish they could have incorporated more of this fun concept into the story.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
Conclusion<br />
----------<br />
Some anime is meant to tug at your heartstrings. Some anime is meant to fill you with a &quot;Go Get &#039;Em!&quot; spirit. Some anime captivates its audience with deep, twisting plots that have you drooling for more. Renai Boukun is not any of those shows. It doesn&#039;t break new ground with confidence or ease. But what it does do is allow you to turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy pure, unadulterated ridiculousness. It doesn&#039;t take itself to serious (even in its more serious moments), and neither should you.<br />
<br />
There is no more perfect analogy for Renai Boukun than to describe it as &quot;junk food&quot; anime. It&#039;s not particularly good for you, and it won&#039;t quell a deep hunger in dire anime situations. However, it will provide a light, focused entertainment series. It knows its strong points, and focuses on them, providing you with a silly, romcom to keep you smiling in between heartier meals.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
Final Rating<br />
------------<br />
While it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: &quot;Would you recommend I watch this show?&quot;. So,<br />
<br />
If you are a fan of romcoms and/or harems, Renai Boukun is a perfect(ly silly) addition to your collection.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy shutting your brain off and wondering just what crazy situation a set of characters will get themselves into this time, you&#039;ll be right at home.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you&#039;re hoping for a heartier look into the genre(s), I&#039;d recommend choosing a more refined, deeper anime.

    I am loving it so far, especially after the fourth episode, where it takes an amazing turn. When I first started watching it I thought, hey, a normal romantic comedy, quite enjoyable. But after the fourth episode, I fell completely into it. . I really hope this new girl is common in the anime, because she made it fantastic. <br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
<br />
The art is pretty great too. Though sometimes it tends to get loose, the dialogue makes up for it. <br />
<br />
-Character-<br />
Okay, so first we have the yandere, Akane. Honestly, quite a shocker but I was glad she did turn out to be one, added some spice into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246723">
        it. After episode 3, she doesn&#039;t seem as Yandere though, maybe accepting the harem a little bit? Guri, pretty standard character, but she enjoys yaoi, so she s pretty much a yaoi fangirl.... Akane&#039;s sister, I can say I don&#039;t find too annoying, since I usually hate sister types(such as Oreimo), but she doesn&#039;t seem to want to get in the way of anyone in the harem, so I don&#039;t mind her. She is quite sweet as well. Shikimi(watch episode 4), just.. damn. She turned the tables on this anime with her personality, and I completely fell head over heels for this character. The main character is quite enjoyable as well, with his gags and all. <br />
<br />
<br />
The story is fairly harem-type, but it is still quite enjoyable. <br />
<br />
--Add on since I&#039;ve watched the whole series now.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t understand why people compare it to death note, at the beginning it has that &quot;Kiss Note&quot; but honestly the rest of the anime is not even similar. I do wish that Shikimi got more screen time, since she only kinda got added to the harem in the last episode. That&#039;s the only thing I would change. I also liked how they all loved each other at the ending as well, which made it more of how it is supposed to be, they&#039;re all in a relationship with each other.<br />

    Spoiler free review<br />
<br />
I welcome feedback on my reviews<br />
<br />

Introducing the Kiss Note! No Kira calm down stop laughing like a maniac we said Kiss Note not Death Note. Ugh anyway...

You can even put down several names at once! Why have only one girlfriend when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250737">
        you can date your entire school? (even that weird girl that sits in the back drawing summoning circles) So don&#039;t wait, don&#039;t delay! Buy your very own Kiss Note today for the low low low low low price of 1 million dollars.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Only a cupid can activate the powers of the Kiss Note, it&#039;s basically useless in the hands of a human. But buy it anyway I need to buy an Akane body pillow help a guy in need<br />
<br />
Love Tyrant is a parody harem. We got our own male MC Seiji Aino who meets Guri, a cupid that accidentally wrote Seiji&#039;s name into her Kiss Note and now has to get him to kiss someone or she will die cause gotta keep that Death Note reference alive. We progress from there with Seiji hooking up with his crush Akane Hiyama, triggering a series of events that turn Seiji&#039;s life upside down. It gets pretty insane as Seiji tries to get used to all the shenanigans that has now arrived due to Guri&#039;s interference. There&#039;s not much story besides the few arcs that throw in some drama to spice things up, but these can either take away the silly charm of the show with some temporary seriousness (give us back our craziness drama!) or be quite heartwarming as we all declare our love for each other.<br />
<br />
The comedy here is the main and best aspect of Love Tyrant. The interactions that the characters have with each other and the crazy situations (that range from running away from a horny demonic demon penguins to dying and meeting your omnipotent father in law) are all incredibly funny, throwing joke after joke to keep you laughing without end. It pokes fun at harems and deres, subtly pointing out the ridiculousness of these tropes that we have become so used to The pacing does start off a little rushed, but it just adds onto the comedy as it gives us more and more hilarious scenes.<br />
<br />
The characters are pretty great as well. Akane is the school idol that turns out to be a kukri-wielding yandere, Yuzu Kichougasaki is a barrier creating tsundere lesbian who&#039;s in love with her sister, and you can&#039;t forget Guri, our lovable otaku cupid that loves creating yaoi ships and causing trouble. Even Seiji, who acts as our slightly dumb Harem MC, has a certain charm to him with his attempts to keep his girlfriends under control so they don&#039;t end up causing too much damage. The rest of the characters (which consists of cupids, sadists, gods, angels, demons, super-powered assassins and bodyguards, the list goes on and on just like this sentence I should really stop) are just introduced to create more comedy or drama, but they get enough screen time across the show to let you see their own unique personalities and quirks<br />
<br />
Romance is handled quite nicely with the whole harem skit. There aren&#039;t any pussy men that can&#039;t handle being 10 metres around women. In fact, there are several dates and kisses shared across the harem as the anime progresses. Sure the show isn&#039;t really that romance heavy as we have Seiji trying to figure things out due to him keeping some generic harem mc traits, but the rest of the show is able to make up for it with its comedy and the occasional sweet moments that just makes your heart skip a little.<br />
<br />
Love Tyrant is definitely not for everyone. Due to it being a harem and comedy anime, there are many people will get turned off due to that fact that they either dislike the overused idea of several girls dating one guy or just don&#039;t enjoy the comedy the show has to offer. However, I highly recommend this show to everyone to at least try out for a few eps. If you dislike it, drop it. If you enjoy it, welcome to the club. We&#039;ll get Guri to write your name in the Kiss Note so you can join the harem.

    Plenty of rom-com series focuses on school life relationships these days between young teens. I can’t say this enough but every season seems to have them in some way or form. Then, there’s Renai Boukun which seems normal at first. But then, you add a thing called the “Kiss Note”, a red headed yandere, a Shinigami, angels, and you get a show of bizarre shenanigans. <br />
<br />
Adapted by the manga of the same name, Renai Boukun is what I envision as a parody or perhaps deconstruction of the rom-com genre. The series starts off with Aino Seiji, a normal high student living his daily life as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250671">
        usual. That is, until one day…he encounters Guri, a female Shinigami who shows him a Kiss Note. It’s a supernatural notebook that makes anyone who has their name written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other. Things take a weird twist when Seiji’s name gets written into the book and he kisses his long time crush, Akane. See where this is going? A bizarre rom-com that adds in supernatural context to entertain the viewers. For me, I think it’s some popcorn comedy that will easily draw some laughs.<br />
<br />
If there’s one thing to mention, Renai Boukun excels at selling its humor. The show has romance but delivers it in such a way that you can’t help but laugh at it. The comedy is played out that can feel ridiculous with characters such as Akane, the beautiful and popular yandere. In almost every scene they are together, she obsessively attaches herself to Seiji. Whenever she senses that Seiji may be “cheating” on her, she goes into full yandere mode in comedic fashion. On the other hand, there’s Guri who seems rather oblivious to the concept of love. The first few episodes shows that she is a very playful girl with a childish personality. Akane doesn’t get along with her as she sees Guri as a “love rival”. In essence, the show portrays their rivalry as a humorous gag rather than a serious drama story. <br />
<br />
Of course, that’s not all. The show introduces more girls into Seiji’s life that adds more humor into the show. Yuzu (half-sister of Akane) adds some subtle yuri context as she seems to be in love with Akane. Her relationship with Seiji is mixed as she sees him as an obstacle but also seems to falling for Seiji as the story progresses. Shikimi Shiramine (Yuzu and Akane’s cousin) adds perhaps a more dramatic element of the show. She doesn’t seem to get along with anyone and sees life like a game. Manipulative and cunning, she enjoys afflicting people and having fun with her games. The relationship she share with Seiji can get quite indecent at times. Unlike Akane, she doesn’t seem to be actually in love with Seiji but often tries to seduce him for the fun of it. Her role in the show adds more drama than any others as some of her actions really influence the plot and characters. <br />
<br />
Despite the amount of humor injected into the show, there’s also some genuine relationship building in particular with Seiji’s sister, Aqua. As the tomboyish sister, Aqua seems to have a rocky relationship with Seiji and we’re shown why through some background storytelling. The series takes a more realistic approach at developing that relationship after certain evens happen in the show. So in a way, not every relationship in this show is a comedy gag. Akane also faces emotional troubles of her own and the series brings that into more light in later episodes. <br />
<br />
As most viewers can expect by now, Renai Boukun is pretty much saturated with comedy that doesn’t even feel like rom-com. Some may can it at a harem given the male-female ratio of the cast. I would say that the show can be enjoyed if you watch it for humor. However, the storytelling itself isn’t well written and in particular, I can’t really connect with the plot from most of the episodes. Only a few episodes portrays itself in a more serious manner and even then, it brushes off in a quick fashion afterwards. The supernatural context can quickly grow dull once you’ve seen it a dozen times. One other issue I find in this show is the presence of Yuzu. This girl has a personality that seems even more childish compared to Guri and I find her presence to be extremely annoying. Seiji himself isn’t an interesting character either. In retrospect, the characters in this can easily be distracting to watch and despite their humorous roles, they don’t stand out particularly much on their own.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, I have some rather mixed feelings. Characters such as Guri, Akane, and Shikimi stands out by their designs while others such as Seiji and Aqua looks too normal. Comedy is portrayed through character expressions that is effective to sell its comedy. However, it sometimes relies on it too much at times that feels uncanny. Oh and some characters just looks ridiculous. I mean, a demonic penguin? An angelic cat? Really? The character designs also has some distracting outlines around them that can be bothersome to look at.<br />
<br />
To say the least, the soundtrack of Renai Boukun is just silly. The OP and ED theme songs parodies character relationships and puts little effort into the choreography. It’s only catchy enough with its lyrics although on most parts, I find it to be absurd. However, I would add that character voice mannerism is memorable particularly with Akane’s yandere tone and Shikimi’s manipulative voice.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Renai Boukun? Is it worth the time? Honestly, the answer to that is up to you because supernatural rom-coms like this is adapted to create laughter. By the end of the day, it hopes to make you laugh rather than getting you invested into the story. When I finished watching this show, I can’t really look back and say “I should have watched this sooner”.<br />

    A cosplaying angel descends to Earth with the goal of utilizing her magical Kiss Note to create couples (preferably yaoi ones) by writing their names down in it to make them fall in love with each other, and somehow manages to end up in a 4-way relationship between herself, a yandere, a lesbian siscon and a perfectly ordinary guy. Sounds ridiculous? Well, that&#039;s Renai Boukun in a nutshell for you.<br />
<br />
This is a hilarious parody of your stereotypical romcom, Death Note and more. Renai Boukun does not take itself seriously whatsoever and is packed to the brim with light-hearted gags and references. It is utterly silly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250664">
        in every sense of the word but doesn&#039;t pretend to be anything else, resulting in a plethora of shameless, unapologetic comedy. And oh boy is it fun to watch. When the mischievous angel Guri arrives in the average joe Seiji&#039;s life, she helps him finally being able to get together with the girl of his dreams—Akane—only for him to find out that she was actually a psychopathic yandere all along with madly possessive feelings of love for him. And when Akane&#039;s little sister Yuzu confesses that she in turn had always been in love with her own sister, things quickly become about as chaotic as it gets after all four of them are roped together into a twisted relationship thanks to the power of Guri&#039;s Kiss Note, which also gives them all immortality. Add to that a creepy dog-angel, a giant black rapist penguin of doom and you&#039;ve got yourself one hell of a strange anime. The whole thing is all over the place, but it results in a ton of absurd slapstick comedy which is very well-executed in general.<br />
<br />
The problem with Renai Boukun however is that it doesn&#039;t maintain the same quality for very long. The first four episodes are hilarious, but starting with episode five, Renai Boukun starts to drop off pretty fast. And it starts with the introduction of a new girl called Shikimi, who just so happens to be *another* psychopath, but unlike Akane, this girl is one of the most obnoxious characters I&#039;ve ever seen. She is the epitome of being crazy for the sake of being crazy with little rhyme or reason attached to it. But her being annoying in person is not the main problem, but rather that she takes the role of the villain in the story and starts interfering with the main characters consistently for her own strange reasons, which results in the anime as a whole becoming significantly more serious as there&#039;s now an enemy they have to fight. Thus, the hilarious comedy/parody content almost disappears entirely to make room for it, which is an awful trade-off. It just leaves you wishing that the story would&#039;ve kept doing what it was doing originally instead.<br />
<br />
Compared to the manga, Renai Boukun is technically a pretty rushed adaptation in terms of how much content is covered in every episode, but given the hysterical and hyperactive nature of the show, the faster pacing ends up working out alright anyway I think (kind of like with the Prison School adaptation). However, the genre-switch unsurprisingly bothered me just as much in the anime as it did in the manga, and that is the main downfall of Renai Boukun.<br />
<br />
Now that doesn&#039;t mean that the show isn&#039;t worth watching all of a sudden. The first few episodes are quite good and even later on it&#039;s still bearable, albeit not great. It&#039;s just one of those series which leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth solely because you know it could have been so much better still.

‘Love Tyrant’ will always be remembered as the anime that made a parody of the classic ‘Death Note’! It has a promising start, setting up an interesting concept that’s slightly different yet feels familiar at the same time! This is achieved in the following way, familiar cause it falls for the same corny ironies such as an MC who’s both dense and uncertain about what he wants while at the same time the anime differs itself with its near perfect timing of comedy which is really the best type! Even though it starts off with an amazing pace, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258487">
        ends on an annoying and boring term because it can’t help shake off all its clichéd tropes. The beginning part worked because the anime understood itself and accepted it without any regrets! What I mean is that the writers knew this show isn’t for everybody so they didn’t waste any time in pleasing everyone, instead they just throw you into this messy story and let you decide whether you want to stick with it or not! It made a point of mocking the Harem genre which worked for a while but later the joke turns on them itself! Comedy is the best thing here, hitting you with unexpected type of jokes which is always fun. But they pretty much bash your head with the same type of gags again and again until it becomes irritating. Towards the end, they jolted to focus more on their preposterous concept by reducing their Comedy which sucked out all the fun from the anime, making everything dull and the climax was pointlessly hastened. <br />
<br />
A cupid cosplaying as a demon named Guri is not very good with her job since she doesn’t understand the concept of Love. Ironic, right? On top of that, she gets bored all the time cause she’s freaking dense so she easily gets distracted from her task whenever something ‘Fun’ comes around! She crosses paths with the MC, Seiji who’s your clichéd nice guy surrounded by pretty girls, and writes his name in the ‘Kiss Note’ which is a diary that makes people fall in love once their names are written in it. But in typical ‘Death Note’ fashion, if only 1 name is written then that person must find a partner quickly or remain a virgin for life! Seiji resolves to put Akane’s name next to his cause he has a secret crush on her which’s suitable because Akane’s crazy about Seiji as well which is very fortunate for him. When I say crazy, I mean literally cause unfortunately she also happens to be a psychological Yandere character who gets effortlessly envious and resorts to extreme violence at once! Sadly, that’s all she does, for the anime opts to replay that same joke over and over again where Akane gets mad and starts stabbing someone! Then Guri, in her nonsensical habit, adds her name into this relationship just cause she thinks it will be fun! Soon the follow up is Akane’s half-sister, Yuzu, who also adds her name cause she’s in love with Akane and this is where the plot starts to make no sense so you should just go along with it. Oh yeah, Yuzu is a clumsy girl who has this morbid fixation for Akane which was creepy to watch but since this is a Harem she also starts eliciting feelings for Seiji as well. Anyway, at one point all must help this lazy plus hyper cupid to do her job cause otherwise they all will end up in hell for some lame reason and that’s how the show starts. Boy that was hard to explain! And what’s worst is this plot rarely ever surfaces again! The story is weak throughout the series, the only difference is that it’s commencement was buoyed with a riveting idea which is why it’s tolerable at first. But due to the half ass effort, the anime later fails to hit the right points with its storytelling which is why it gives off a bitter and boring vibe when the show shifts its focus to more serious exposition! This is the reason why sub plots like the whole family drama between Akane and Yuzu or the backstory with Guri didn’t land with the audience since it lacked any real depth to it. An attempt was made to flesh out their female characters but they were so rushed and poorly done, I couldn’t help ask why even bother? Proper development is achieved by giving details and time to tell a well-fashioned tale which is never applied here, instead characters are one note with distinctive epitomes of other anime’s.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The artwork falls in with every other Harem anime with its bright colours and fan service but there was something with the character designs that caught my eyes for I could tell something was off but I can’t seem to place it! It was slightly distracting! The animation met the standard outlooks despite some untraditional attempts with the camera angles. Even the sound effects used to play up the humour wasn’t very notable but the Dubs here was great, nicely capturing the vibe for these whacky characters which the Subs failed to carry. Both OP/ED botched to leave any impression and shall be forgotten quickly though the video for OP was kinda nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the first few episodes, thinking this might turn into a great Comedy anime for I didn’t mind its chaotic setup or straightforward characters. And I did laugh at some jokes though this show needed more since it lacked fresh and self-aware humour, rather much of its Comedy comes from overused gags which becomes dull after a while. With nothing else going on except for clichéd characters and story that relies heavily on repeatable puns, it turned this ‘could have fun show’ to a predictable one that just can’t be recommended to others! Instead I offer you to check out ‘Kono Subarashi’ that really nails the head with its Comedy, Story and Characters!

    I stand corrected, a freshly not so routine with self ulterior motives by a guy dragged down what lies when a cupid appears to fall desire on him. Which some tropes can easily be broke down by such good laughs and mood as I happily share my gags within this settings  that comes to an end.<br />
<br />
The target from set of my view captures every details by chapter and a little too cheesy which is why organizing the world building by characters are droven such qualities. <br />

Falling into Harem category seems off but the twice scenario felt a little enjoyable. Pinned to the selections of

        a decent underrated show, with new studio takes a lot of credit to make the series won&#039;t loose track. <br />

Quite episodic if you asked me, But that&#039;s not all, Any romance situation depicts the parts of least conquest on &quot;How to win your love onto someone&quot; from Random lovey dovey tsukkomi boke theme.<br />

A fair of Romcom to satisfy your stress relieves any set of pain... I think I entrust you to watch and check this out already.<br />

    This show was really really funny, I lovey comedy anime!!!<br />
The story wasn&#039;t that prevelant as it was more episodic. <br />
My favorite characters were definitely akane and cousin shikimi.<br />
These two definitely made the show what it was. Yandere and craziness sold me from the very start.<br />
<br />
Also the kiss note was a funny parody of the death note. Could you imagine if light would&#039;ve got that book instead of the actual death note. If I had it, I&#039;d probably ship myself with a yandere hottie. A slow part would probably be the random fights between seijis sister aqua and a penguin that loves her named Solis. <br />

        been watching a lot of shows lately, but this one really stood out to me. It has best girls and plenty of comedy, a must watch for anyone who likes these things. I really wish their would be a second season.

    I honestly don&#039;t think it deserves that bad of a rating. Renai Boukun after all, is just mindless entertainment. It doesn&#039;t take itself seriously. When comparing it to other anime of the same caliber, then it&#039;s arguably one of the better ones.<br />
<br />
It starts off making us laugh right off the bat with constant parodies like the kiss note (death note reference) and while it does go &quot;downhill&quot; after the first few episodes, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean it&#039;s bad. Yes, you may not laugh as much as you used to but if you don&#039;t compare the episodes and judge them individually, it isn&#039;t that bad.<br />
<br />
The characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250785">
        whom all have their own trope, use it to their advantage. They take it and use it to entertain us. They all have their own distinct trait that make them stand out from each other which can be pretty obvious because of the beautiful and clear animation. They aren&#039;t &quot;fleshed out&quot; but as since this is a character driven anime and the only purpose for them is to give us humor, then it&#039;s safe to say they did a good job.<br />
<br />
Of course, that doesn&#039;t make it an excuse to ignore the flaws of it. It did have lot&#039;s of potential wasted. It did go downhill to a certain extent. But in the end, it still made me laugh a ton and it would take more than 10 hands to count how many times i&#039;ve smiled.<br />
<br />
If you like harems, comedy, an actual decent harem protag, yandere, parodies, and overall mindless fun then this is your go-to anime. Definitely a must-watch. Trust me on this one.

    Renai Boukun (Love Tyrant) is the go to anime for anyone who loves modern dystopian settings.  Guri, an angel with the absolute power to make people fall in love for the rest of their lives, has dedicated her life to randomly pairing men together for funsies! On nothing but her own whim and an inability to comprehend any level of responsibility,  she pairs random couples--who now have to spend their lives together—forever. <br />
At this point I feel that it’s important to tell you that her power stems from a “Kiss Note” that looks exactly like the Death Note. They make a joke about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247240">
        it. It’s funny. They laugh. I’m dead inside. <br />
For some reason or another, please don’t ask the particulars of her incredible gift. I’ve tried to determine the exact rules and all I know after 5 episodes is that there are no rules. None. Any rules that do get set in place are almost immediately broken or contradicted or both.  The more you watch, the more you realize you are actually in hell.<br />
But back to what is probably considered “plot.” Guri has now put herself in a relationship by writing her name, the main anime boy ™’s name, his crush, and his crush’s sister’s name in the notebook and connecting them together. <br />
The little sister wants to bone the bigger sister, main anime boy™ wants to bone the bigger sister, the bigger sister wants to kill fuck the main anime boy™, and also the sisters have a cousin who just wants to plain kill all of them? And they’re all forced to love Guri—who thinks this is all hilarious and fun. And remember, they’re together forever. <br />
They exist in a landscape built of psychological horror. <br />
They’re not allowed to love anyone else. Ever. I mean, I think I’d feel bad for them, but even the little sister loses sympathy points after she sneaks into her sister’s changing room and takes naked pictures—which Guri then promptly sends to the love…pentagon?<br />
So this is the conclusion of my 2:30AM anime review of this PILE OF BURNING TRASH.  I watched this with my friend and we are both a little bit less human because of it. <br />
TL;DR: This anime is hell and anyone who likes pink haired girl as a character should reevaluate themselves as a living being. Stalking is not cute.<br />
<br />

    A interesting anime that I enjoyed, a sort of playful take on death note, but with a kiss note, it starts simple, but you quickly realize there is more to the series then first thought.<br />
<br />
Story:  It&#039;s a simple story, but it&#039;s very character driven, the conflicts and plot are from each of the different characters developing and works for me.<br />
<br />
Art:  It&#039;s decent, I don&#039;t remember anything amazing, but nothing terrible either.<br />
<br />
Characters:   this is probably it&#039;s strongest point, they seem one dimensional at first, but as the story goes on you learn more about each one, with some nice and strange twists,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250692">
        and I felt good humour.<br />
<br />
Overall and enjoyment:   I liked it, I kinda hope there will be a second season, but even if not it works as a nice series on it&#039;s own I feel.

    Let me start by saying this, Love tyrant is an underrated show. That being said it isn&#039;t perfect and far from it, it&#039;s pretty sloppily made  and can seem very uninspired, which it might very well be, but if you are willing to go past that and stop expecting a &quot;normal&quot; show you will find that it is an extremely entertaining parody of the most cliché tropes in anime. <br />
<br />
Whether it is on purpose or by accident, they reuse every tired anime trope but instead of adding something original, they crank it up to 11 which leads to everything the characters do being incoherent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299985">
        with the story in an unprecedented clash that will instantly shatter any bit of immersion you may have had in the story. This contrast between what is expected and what you get turns out to be a very powerful tool of parody making the viewer realise the storytelling flaws of widely accepted anime conventions.<br />
<br />
Of course this premise would get tired very quickly were it not for the humor put forward by the show. I&#039;m not going to praise it as being a work of genius or anything, the laughter comming mostly from simple shock humor and visual gags but let&#039;s be real, this is anime we are talking about, the bar is already set pretty low on what constitutes a funny bit. So as I was saying, the jokes are not all that great but the writers manage to keep it relatively fresh and though I wouldn&#039;t say I laughed at all the gags, not even most of them, but a couple moments managed to make me laugh out loud (something I rarely do) even if it was only at how jarring some parts are.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it goes a bit downhill at the end when  the &quot;story&quot; took a turn to something more serious, in any capacity this thing has to be, and lost the one redeeming quality it had. You end up having to follow for 2 episodes these washed up jokes of characters trying desperately to have some development that would lead to a climax and doing so, threw out the window every bit of surprise or weird factor that it previously had. All of this strongly hinted at the fact that the writer did intend to write an actual story but nevertheless, I dont believe that the intent takes away anything.<br />
<br />
All in all, can I say that it was a good show? Not really, but it sure was entertaining to watch because in the end, even though I&#039;m not exactly sure if I was laughing with or at it, I can tell you one thing, I was laughing. <br />

    Good story. The immortal part was a nice gimmick to this anime. It was used well until the end when the anime had the immortals die. Being immortal kinda means you cannot die so in it if an angel or God wants you to die you still die. It did not work in the last episode which Akane was able to kill herself to get to Hell to help the others in the harem. <br />
The relationship building between Seiji, Akane, and Yuzu was interesting. Guri was not on screen alot though when she was it was for a comedy reason most of the time. <br />

    Real Score 6.75\10<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get this straight, Renai Boukun(Or Love Tyrant) is not a Death Note parody, it just takes the Death Note element but it&#039;s not trying to parody that show. Renai Boukun is a parody of the Harem genre: in a time where we had the Superhero\Shonen Parodies, Adventure\Fantasy Parodies and even Daily life parodies, we never actually had a fully developed parody of the Harem genre. Renai Boukun starts incredibly well, it takes some of the worst and best elements of the Harem genre and makes fun of them in a clever and funny way, the characters are walking parodies of typical Harem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251399">
        stereotypes: we have The Yandere, The Good guy everyone falls in love with, the Tsundere eccetera...<br />
The biggest problem lies in the rundown of the show, in fact the more we good deep in the show, the more we approach the end, the more the show falls in the same Cliché abyss that it tries to make fun of, it never loses its identity but it loses a lot of steam and that entertainment shown in the first 3 episodes<br />
<br />
Story 6.25<br />
The story is simple and effective, and it should have stayed that way the entirety of the rundown, shows like these don&#039;t need a convoluted and serious story, however, during the end, the show  makes the enormous mistake  to take itself too seriously with a subplot that could have been easily avoided. The parody elements are quite funny, it takes a little bit of everything that we know or have seen and parodies them in a really fun way, just look at the Akane characters, she&#039;s a walking Yandere and Rias(HighScholl DxD) parody. Here everything is overly exaggerated  and approached in a humorous and, i have to say, kind of unique way: it&#039;s nothing new, but some of the directions of the story are pretty unexpected in their exaggeration<br />
<br />
Characters 6.5<br />
The characters are, by far, the most entertaining part of the Anime, Aino Seiji is your typical  stereotype of the genuine good guy that everyone fall in love with, but everyone that surrounds him is that damn good. Akane is your typical Yandere, but she&#039;s so exaggerated and she&#039;s put in so many incredible situations, all in order to show a different take of the Yandere character and, at the same way, parody the Yandere in general. Yuzu is your typical Tsundere, she&#039;s bipolar and could be annoying sometimes , but if you take her as a parody of all of the Tsunderes you know and, maybe, love, if you see her in a different light, you can actually see and get what the author tried to express trhough Yuzu, a good and charming parody of the Tsundere. Shikimi is the least developed and, to be honest, her character arc is nonexistant, she&#039;s just there for the sexy shots and for the sadist moments, not that good. But the best character also is  the incarnation of the theme of the Anime: i&#039;m talking about Guri, she is the quintessential essence of the parody part of this Anime, she&#039;s funny, charming, she doesn&#039;t care about the story, spits references every 5 minutes(some really funny) and acts like she wants the story to follow the patterns of the genre, while at the same time parodying them. Too bad that Guri suffers from the same problem of all the characters and the story itself, her character arc is wasted and it takes itself too seriously, taking all of her magic and charm away<br />
<br />
Sound 7<br />
The music perfectly gets the tone and, Satoshi Motoyama really did an incredible job capturing the themes and parody aspect of the show in his compositions. The Opening, done by Wake up Girls, also is perfect fpr the show, energetic, dynamic, exagerated and over the top. The soundtrack is energetic thourghout the entire  show, never goes beyond that, and it has not the need to do it, the music&#039;s fine as it is<br />
<br />
Animation and Direction 7<br />
The drawings and the art are pretty cool, the white and trasparent lines add that little bit of exaggeration needed to the characters. The frames look good but some of the drawings, especially in the background, are lackluster. The direction is standard, it&#039;s good but it suffers some problems, especially in the &quot;FanService&quot; shots, which become tiring really fast. The animation is solid and the bright colours fit the parody element really well<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7.5<br />
I had a lot of fun with this Anime, even though i didn&#039;t like the serious tone that the final episodes take. Comedy can be subjective, i know that, but the parody elements and, knowing the Harem genre, the way the show parodies them, makes fun of them and basically spits in some of the most famous tropes. Quick mention to some of the reactions and faces of the characters, they&#039;re really cool and pretty amazing at times, they have that Gintama vibe that&#039;s always appreciated. I laughed at some of the references, there are a lot of them, and a pretty fun time overall, i really enjoyed the jokes and parody element, and Guri was always entertaining, until the end of course<br />
<br />
So this was Renai Boukun, a really fun show, a really interesting parody of Harem  genre while, at the same time, being a funny take of some  of the most common characters in Anime industry. It could have been a really fun satire\parody if it just didn&#039;t take itself too seriously at the end end if ti didn&#039;t add a characters who&#039;s just there for, i guess, sadistic purposes(I think). This, however, doesn&#039;t take that much away from what Renai Boukun really is: a nice, funny and amusing to spend your time, just turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy this really fun ride that was &quot;Renai Boukun&quot;.

    So I mostly tend to see people either fanboy and love this anime or people trash it for idiotic reasons.  I am just going to give you a straight  review<br />
<br />
Story 5\10<br />
First off, its a parody of death not and a slice of life\comedy anime so not really looking for much.  The story is based off our MC meeting Guri an angel trying to make couples. This is done through the kiss note which is essential the death note but you write two peoples names and they fall in love. This anime follows that story for a bit than focuses on the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251137">
        more or less the second half of the anime. <br />
 <br />
Characters 7\10<br />
The character are not linear and have backstories that are explained properly or given a good shot at least. The characters besides the MC make the show worth watching. Most of them have some generic tropes along with there own spice or something totally new and the show made me laugh quite a bit. For a while now most &quot;comedy anime&quot; has made  me cringe or sigh more than laugh so this anime was a nice pick up for this alone.<br />
<br />
Art 8\10<br />
The art in this anime is very nice with some cool art styles in the op and the anime. It was nice to see something new that worked so well. It was a real treat to look at.<br />
<br />
Overall 7\10<br />
This anime is a fairly good comedy done right with some problems sure but if your looking for a good parody\comedy this is worth picking up. right now the chances of a second season are basically 0 since  the manga is not much further ahead than the anime along with popularity not being high but for what we have alone, its better than most comedys coming out today.<br />
