    Over the past 10 years of watching anime, there have been hundreds of stinkers, truly dreadful shows that have tested my tolerance to its utmost limits, but, gee, I think we&#039;ve found the stinker of all stinkers with this one. <br />
<br />
That is to say, &quot;Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai&quot; (or however the hell you are supposed to abbreviate this dumb, dumb, cretinous title) is the worst TV anime I&#039;ve ever seen. Yes, number one, and without any hyperbole intended. It doesn&#039;t get any uglier than this, and I do mean so literally as well as figuratively...<br />
<br />
Let me showcase the amazing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296288">
        dialogue with one of the show&#039;s finer moments:<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#039;m the up-and-coming author, Enryuu Homura!&quot;<br />
*gasps so hard he is practically dying* &quot;I&#039;m a huge fan! Please give me your autograph!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#039;re a fan... a fan of my... ? This is humiliating. I&#039;m the one who wants an autograph!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, what do you mean, you want my autograph?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you even listening to me? I want your autograph!&quot;<br />
&quot;Y-you want my autograph? B-but why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#039;t that obvious? I&#039;m a huge fan of yours, Towano.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hawuuuhhhh??&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, there is plenty more, deeply intelligent, riveting content, such as a five minute discussion on what it means to flash one&#039;s panties, the protagonist dressed in bondage clothing and whipped by his little sister until the crack of dawn, him sniffing and fondling his sister&#039;s hair during a live radio interview, or some random girl the protagonist has only known for about two days cosplaying in his bedroom to test what does and what doesn&#039;t make him pop a boner, because apparently that is relevant to writing fiction. Where she even got her cosplay outfit is a mystery only the heavens can unfold, because, really, who in the hell carries around a succubus outfit for no reason? &quot;Ah, at long last, an occasion has presented itself for me to wear this succubus outfit I&#039;ve carried around all these years.&quot; Perhaps she cast some incantation to summon it from the abyss? Who knows. Whatever. <br />
<br />
Every asinine, ludicrous trope a light novel adaptation could possibly have (yes, even in 2018, apparently) is present here: the obligatory beach scene (complete with lewd lotion-lathering), girls screaming at Yuu (the protagonist) for walking in on them changing clothes, an unnecessary harem, and like its mouth-breathing brother, Infinite Stratos, all members of said harem are for some reason attracted to the protagonist despite him having the same level of appeal as a cockroach. I don&#039;t even want to refer to the protagonist by his name since he doesn&#039;t deserve the honor of having one. So, actually, in the unfortunate event that I must discuss this show again, he will remain &#039;the protagonist&#039;. That sounds a lot better, sort of like I&#039;ve rinsed my mouth of bacteria.<br />
<br />
I present a challenge: try watching an entire episode of this show without shuddering or saying &#039;ugh&#039; in response to the hideous faces the characters make. It&#039;s a bit of a difficult one, alright. Whereas many poorly-animated TV series are infamous for a few particular screenshots, eye-cancer here and there (say, Naruto Shippuden), here it is that but all the time. It is so bad that sometimes the characters&#039; eyes are not even aligned and instead are facing opposite directions, as if they are truly and completely mentally void, or are just... uh, ant-people? Even a climactic confession scene is brimming with ant-people for your viewing pleasures. <br />
<br />
The &#039;music&#039;... music? Can you call it that? A, B, A, B - random, senseless notes played repetitively on a piano, like a kindergartner who has discovered a piano for the first time and thinks any noise it makes is special.  &quot;Wow, you&#039;re so good!&quot;, says mommy. Clap-clap. Why they even bothered to include these tracks is a wonder, considering how much less ear-piercing some good ol&#039; silence would have been instead. No, having music for the sake of having music is not always a good idea, but when has this anime ever shown itself capable of good ideas, anyway?<br />
<br />
All that is even remotely tolerable about this giant turd of an anime is its opening and ending themes. Mostly for the music, and definitely not for the putrid animation, but rather for the lack of it since these sequences are essentially slideshows. Any time things start moving is when things get real ugly, and so I can only be thankful for the few seconds when the damn show doesn&#039;t move.<br />
<br />
It is pretty well remarkable how much of a disaster the production process of this anime has been. Even the animators recognise the abysmal state of their anime, what with their subtle cry for help in the ending credits of the sixth episode, where they changed one of the names to 正直困太, which can be translated as &quot;Honestly, we&#039;re in a bit of a mess.&quot; This is perhaps unprecedented for a TV anime. Though I do not know the actual situation at the anime studio, it is pretty clear the animators were both understaffed and forced into impossible deadlines (and thus had to cut corners... all of them, to meet said deadlines), because, really, there is no sane person on this planet who would look at the animation and think &quot;Yep, this is totally good to go for broadcast.&quot; Even the most terrible of terrible anime at least put some semblance of effort into covering up their blemishes: here, it is in full, putrid glory. <br />
<br />
And so, &quot;Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai&quot; will be remembered by those unfortunate enough to watch it. It is an anime that truly goes for it, being as dreadful as possible in every and all aspects. I can&#039;t even find the energy to lambaste it to the extent I did with my previously most-hated anime, Infinite Stratos 2, for in this case it is so pathetic it actually transcends words. The worst TV anime I&#039;ve ever endured, and congratulations for that, as it was not an easy feat. <br />
<br />
Like a train that has tipped over and burst into flames and debris, this is something you would be best not to approach. Put a hazard warning on this one.

    TL;DR at bottom<br />
<br />
I think there are more shows about Sisters wanting to bang their Brothers (&amp; vice versa), than there are actual instances of such behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at the premise no one will be expecting a great story and characters.<br />
But this anime fails to clear the low bar, it set for itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything about this anime is horrendous.<br />
<br />
Animation &amp; Art 1/10: <br />
Looks like a shitty low budget hentai from mid-2000s.<br />
<br />
Characters 1/10: <br />
Calling the characters Cardboard will be an insult to such a useful material.<br />
<br />
Story 1/10:<br />
Little sister wants to bang his Idiot big Bro. Comedy Gold, Am I right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Although I don&#039;t like this genre of anime. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294049">
        in case of anime like Eromanga Sensei, I can still get a laugh or two while also appreciating the art and some story elements making it somewhat enjoyable.<br />
<br />
<br />
But this anime is an absolute atrocity.<br />
If they were so short on budget, they should have made one (30-min) episode of a hentai and called it a day. <br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
**A brother and sister sitting together**<br />
<br />
Sister: Onii-chan I love you so much... I wanna have your babies... Give me the D...!<br />
<br />
Brother (his face mis-shapen, eyes crossed, his neck twisted in an un-godly manner): Oh, thats the dialogue from the book you are writing...Cool.<br />
<br />
**Sister turns her head to reveal her asymmetrical face, her left eye gazes upward while her right eye wanders , her nose just a tiny blot atop her inverted lips**<br />
She says: B...B...BAKA..!<br />

    About 18 months ago when Eromanga-sensei finished, I was one of the few people that actually bothered to speak up in its defense. While the show was far from perfect, I found that a great deal of the criticisms it received stemmed more from public peer pressure, people simply disliking the genre to begin with and/or disagreement with the more morally questionable elements of the show, neither of which are particularly good arguments in my opinion as the issue primarily lies on the viewer&#039;s own end in that case. I remember someone asking me back then what I thought a genuinely bad incest anime would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296152">
        look like then if not even Eromanga-sensei fit the bill. I don&#039;t recall what I answered at the time, but I can at least say that if someone were to ask me the same thing today, then they need not look any further than this. What you have right here is a prime example of almost everything you can possibly do wrong with an imouto-centric anime.<br />
<br />
Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai—or &quot;The One I Love Is a Little Sister, but She&#039;s Not My Little Sister&quot; in English—is a stupidly long title which as far as I know doesn&#039;t have a proper acronym so me and my friends have simply referred to it as &quot;the imouto show&quot; throughout the season, but for the purpose of this review I&#039;ll just refer to it by its official English title to make things easier, namely My Sister, My Writer. In short the anime is about yet another high schooler (Yuu) who is a wannabe light novel author, except this time it&#039;s his little sister (Suzuka) who ends up going pro first—by writing a novel about her love to her Onii-chan and publishing it online. Of course she&#039;s too shy to actually tell him the book is based on her own genuine feelings, and since her school doesn&#039;t allow students to have part-time jobs combined with her father probably not approving of it, Suzuka decides to tell the world that Yuu is the real author of her novel. And thus begins the story of a brocon imouto continuously putting her incestuous fantasies on paper and letting her brother deal with the public reception.<br />
<br />
Now this all sounds quite cliché and not particularly original, but nevertheless a show like this doesn&#039;t really need to be any more complicated than this to be successful. It&#039;s been proven in the past after all; as long as the girls are cute and the show focuses on enhancing that element, that can be all it takes to be enjoyable. In theory that is. But in practice that is not the case here as My Sister, My Writer is unfortunately a never-ending train wreck in multiple aspects, and this is but the tip of the iceberg.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the girls in this show could have been cute, but the simple truth is they&#039;re not. Mostly because they don&#039;t make any damn sense. Girls throwing themselves at the protagonist without much motivation is nothing new for harems, but this anime really pushes the limits. At the very least I have never seen a completely random girl show up one day and ask if she could be the MC&#039;s little sister and if she could call him Onii-chan before. That&#039;s not just something you can swallow because it&#039;s not just weird but it doesn&#039;t even make any logical sense! Or how about the ero-doujin writer girl obsessed with drawing hardcore rape porn and going under the pen name Ahegao Double Peace-sensei. I mean really now. Like the girls in this show really don&#039;t have much reason to associate with Yuu in the first place, let alone act like his family from day one. It&#039;s just so unnatural to watch. And as far as Suzuka goes, well she definitely had the potential to be cute and likable, but it seems like her personality just flip-flops at complete random in order to suit whatever context the current scene in play seems to demand. I still have no idea how I&#039;m supposed to describe her. Sometimes she&#039;s a tsundere, sometimes a deredere, sometimes an airhead, sometimes a total pervert and sometimes just a normal, kindhearted and wholesome girl. Being two-faced is one thing but this is just too much. It only makes any attempts at comedy fall flat instead since everything feels so incredibly forced and unnatural.<br />
<br />
But okay then, this is just a simple ecchi comedy in the end, so surely we don&#039;t need to think so much about all of this stuff as long as the girls are hot and put it appropriately sexual situations, right? Well that is usually the last resort for an anime like this, the one thing they can always fall back on as a proper reason to watch and hopefully enjoy the show. However, that to me is the real nail in the coffin as to why My Sister, My Writer simply doesn&#039;t work as an anime. Quite simply, it looks absolutely miserable.<br />
<br />
About halfway through the show there was a subtle SOS sent out from one of the show&#039;s animators in the ending credits, basically saying that they were in trouble and needed help. And it&#039;s clear as day that this anime has suffered from major production issues. We&#039;ve had some delays but above all the episodes themselves just don&#039;t even look finished. There are numerous shots throughout the series with blatant animation errors, like a torso being cut off in mid-air and similar; the kind of stuff that would never go past a proper quality control, but evidentially they haven&#039;t had the time for that here. As a result, the whole anime looks ridiculous. Character designs are all over the place, wearing derp faces more often than not and perhaps most importantly different ones all the time. Suzuka&#039;s face might look disfigured in one frame, and then in the next one equally so but in a totally different way, as if you were looking at a different character altogether. It is incredibly distracting, disorienting and not pleasing to the eyes whatsoever. And keeping in mind that the main selling point of an ecchi anime is pretty much always the attractiveness of its female characters, having them look this hideous on top of their already non-sensical behavior means that there really isn&#039;t much left to cheer for. And no, it&#039;s not like the art in KonoSuba which is intentionally crude in order to enhance comedic effect. This is just plain sloppy and distracting like handing in a painting that&#039;s only half-finished.<br />
<br />
I try to stay open-minded when it comes to anime and normally it&#039;s mostly a matter of personal preference regarding what I might recommend an anime for and to who, but in this case I&#039;m really reaching at straws. An anime like Eromanga-sensei is easy to recommend people that just want to see a bunch of cute girls in light-hearted sexual situations, but the same certainly can&#039;t be said for My Sister, My Writer. It fails at trying to have an interesting plot, it fails at trying to be funny, and above all it fails at even having cute, sexy or likable characters. So really, what is the point of this show? Why would anyone want to watch it? If it wasn&#039;t for the production issues there might have been at least some merit to it, but in its current state there really isn&#039;t. The only somewhat positive thing I could say is that at least it isn&#039;t boring per se, but it&#039;s so awkward and annoying that it doesn&#039;t help much. As a result this is easily one of the worst incest anime I have ever seen in my life. They&#039;re going to have to do some miracle work with the BDs to turn this sinking ship around, but I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up too high.

    Japan and their flow of ideas makes me wonder how many more &quot;imouto&quot; theme anime we’ll get in this generation. To begin with, I think light novel adaptations in today’s world about imoutos can hardly be an eye-catcher except for some specific audiences. What draws people to this type of show…that’s none of my business. But to be honest, why did this abysmal show get made in the first place?<br />
<br />
In perhaps one of the most catastrophic launch of the year, the show already started with intolerable quality issues. The first few episodes won’t be hard to judge as you can see easily see the inconsistent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296147">
        character models. You don’t really need to be a genius to also realize the amount of inconsistency with the character expressions either. Every character behaves in one dimensional and lifeless ways that can’t really be compared to real humans. They look like plastic dolls that came to life. It’s fake. And by that, characters in this show are seemingly created with the purpose of wish-fulfillment. They are essentially characters that exist to satisfy the desires of a main protagonist, and in this case, that would be Yuu Nagami.<br />
<br />
Now I don’t want to jump the gun too far ahead but anyone who has seen a show in 2017 known as “Eromanga sensei” may make some comparisons to this anime. Both shows involves light novel writing and has pseudo-incest tendencies. From the beginning, it’s pretty obvious that Suzuka is infatuated with Yuu. It becomes a running gag with her showing the most emotions whenever other girls are around him. The most obvious feeling she shows is jealousy and it appears in almost every episode. Sometimes, it gets in the way of the main story as this running gag becomes a major distraction. Even when female characters interacts with Yuu in a non-romantic nature, she still shows jealousy. It’s pretty pathetic.<br />
<br />
But hey, that’s not the only distraction right? Well, look again. For the majority of the series, it seems almost every female character with a name is interested in Yuu in some way. For instance, there’s Mai who literally stalks Yuu to find out about his personal life. Sakura enters the show as an ideal woman but it doesn’t take long for her to get into a love angle with him. Let’s not forget Ahegao W Peace-sensei who adheres to adult jokes with her personality. The bottom line is that these characters are made with little creativity in mind. They exist to fulfill wish-fulfillment roles and Yuu often finds himself in awkward/lustful situations with them. However, the main selling context of the character relationship is still Yuu and Suzuka. The two makes the heart of the show and that’s not a good thing when you get pseudo-incest context.<br />
<br />
Hey, what about the main story? Actually, you can probably watch this show without a direct goal in mind. This series is like a playful toy that enjoys fooling around with its characters than telling a story. Even before finishing the show, I had little expectations of how it would end. Every episode jumps back and forth with no real direction in mind. It&#039;s like a bloody loop with the same things happening every episode. At times, I wonder if this anime was made as a satire to make fun of itself. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case because a satire would have to be clever enough to sell its humor. It would have to mock fun of itself but this show was hardly creative enough to do that. What I did laugh at though is the shockingly production qualities. At one point, there was even one episode with a hidden message by an animator in the credits who pleads for help. From what I’ve read on the web, the show itself involved animators that weren’t even paid for their work. It’s a sad reality to realize that the anime was a project with little planning in mind and in fact, made just this year. From one of the tweets from an animator, they questioned why they are making this show. And honestly, I wondered why too. So I return to my original question, why did this abysmal show get made?<br />
<br />
In a sane world, a show like this would have been scrapped from the start with such poor planning and execution. It has such a forgettable story and uncharismatic character cast that I can’t help but recommend people to avoid this like the plague. This show could have probably even worked better as an OVA rather than 10 episodes. What came out instead is hot garbage that gave a distasteful smell. And sadly, there&#039;s no cure.

    There are a lot of negative reviews for this series, so I wanted to provide my own input.<br />
This show is absolutely HILARIOUS. I feel a lot of people are watching this show for the wrong reasons. Yes the story is bad. Yes the characters are 2 dimensional. But again, the comedy is top notch.<br />
<br />
The art is just incredible. The main heroine (the imouto) will go from looking like 10 different people within the same episode. Her face will melt between a cute as heck little sister to a cross-eyed goblin, and it is amazing. She will be on her bed with a normal pillow, then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309903">
        the next second the pillow has become a gigantic shark pillow. She will be in the most awkward, physically unnatural poses, and I just can&#039;t stop laughing.<br />
<br />
As if that isn&#039;t enough, the over the top voice acting, for the mostly absolute nonsense dialogue drives it all home.<br />
<br />
There is a ton of entertainment value to be had here. Watch this as an over the top surreal comedy, and you will have a good time.<br />

    Unlike most other reviews I rather enjoy this anime. <br />
<br />
1. The story is cliche and has been done before. It&#039;s even been done in a better way. It is based off of a light novel in case you didn&#039;t know. <br />
2. The Art is terrible, I mean its like I am watching scenes from an Ero-ga game that have been fast forwarded and dubbed over to emulate an anime. I mean studio NAZ has done some great stuff but Magia Doraglier is (as far as I can tell) some Indonesian animation studio that has never done any other works. <br />
3. The sound is fine, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294920">
        voice acting is ok. The main male lead has done a lot of supporting stuff and the main female lead is really new. <br />
4. The character archetypes are rather standard. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s jump to the enjoyment factor though, and the overall score I am giving is 7! I absolutely enjoy this anime. I would recommend you watch it and just like this review take it with a grain of salt. You get what you are watching for, it&#039;s another &quot;Oni-Chan I love you!&quot;, &quot;Ero (light novel) Sensei&quot; type little sister loves her older brother kinda fan-service anime that we&#039;ve all seen before and all will watch again. It is a time waster, if you have nothing else to watch and you are bored do yourself the favor. Sometimes its good to watch something low quality to reset your standards. Over all, its pretty bad, but at the same time if you go into it knowing that it can be rather enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

    Incest is a relationship between fellow families, usually incest occurs between brother and sister.<br />
<br />
Ore ga nano Suki wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai is an anime series adapted from a light novel that tells sisters to live their daily lives as novelists. One day Yuu found her sister Suzuka as a novelist, but Suzuka&#039;s parents did not agree if she became a novel writer therefore she asks for the help of her brother Yuu to become Suzuka&#039;s representative as Towano Chikai.<br />
<br />
Speaking of studios, do you know that most of the studio studios are more focused on finance, considering that they are very minimizing the losses

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296155">
        by making animations as simple as possible. simple starting from the selection of colors that are not so contrasting until the background is not right.<br />
<br />
As I explained above, the studio prefers to minimize funds for making anime. A Seiyuu anime series is important because a good character not only has a good description but a good character must also have the right seiyuu. From this series they bringing unique seiyuu they rarely appear in several anime series but they are arguably skilled enough to play their respective roles.After I surfed or searched for a number of sources on the internet I found less information about artists to fill the opening and closing themes.<br />
<br />
Some anime series have a characteristic ranging from character to character design. Suzuka is a younger brother of Yuu She has a feeling of love for her sister but her love is hindered by some rules in the world. Yuu is the older brother of Suzuka and is a novelist. who is kind to anyone. Tsundere and Kuudere dominate this series even though they are only supporting characters.<br />
<br />
Roncom is the two most awaited genre by some people. When I heard this year there was an incest-themed anime series that crossed my mind it was &quot;definitely suitable to fill an empty time&quot;. To be honest all of you will enjoy this one series even though they have a short epiaode but enough to fill your empty time right?<br />
<br />
Overall I really enjoy the screening of this series even though it has many shortcomings. In the end the rules were made to be violated and obeyed.

    “I HAVE HAD IT…WITH THESE M-(blank)-KING IMOUTOS….ON THIS M-(blank)-KING PLANE!”<br />
-Me, emulating my inner Samuel L. Jackson<br />
<br />
I do have a personal tenant of &quot;for every good or great show, try to watch at least a bad one to balance out your experience&quot;, but geezus, this was on a exponentially higher level of existence in terms of being &quot;turrible&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can safely say that I probably have just about had it with these cheaply written “imouto” shows. For as long as I can recall since first getting into anime several years ago (a somewhat late bloomer), the Japan entertainment industry has been producing countless numbers of anime TV

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296164">
        shows, films, book series, and physical and digital anime merchandise, many of which are designed to fulfill the numerous different fetishes of millions of anime/manga/LN fans alike. In this current era, the drive by Japan to fuel such fetishes, which aren’t as positively looked upon by most of the audience outside the country (especially the Western side), has become more and more apparent. This includes a certain recurring category known as “incest”, otherwise called brocon or siscon, depending on the focused relations. I don’t think I need to specify why “incest” is a very sketchy and infamous term (that’s someone else’s job, not mine). While this genre is not necessarily a terrible option in terms of writing a story, it is very easy to mess up the premises and key elements of that story. For this particular show, known in English as “My Sister, My Writer”….well, let’s just say...it really messed up EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
STORY: 0/10<br />
Yes, I’m not kidding. BIG. FAT. ZERO. (ofc MAL doesn’t have the “0” option, though)<br />
Lemme explain the setup here first:<br />
The little sister character, Suzuka Nagami, is in middle school and already looking like a prodigy. She has excellent grades, is the student council president, and is the author, under the pen name of “Towano Chikai”, of an award-winning light novel which is, unsurprisingly, about a little sister with quite the brotherly complex. The little sister does most of the housework due to the two living together without their parents….<br />
-------------<br />
Alright, pause! By this time already, this is where I think this show really starts to accumulate with problems: the all-too-convenient plot device of no parents or even guardians physically showing up whatsoever…in fact, it’s even a stretch for the mom or dad to even be mentioned as often as they should’ve, and I don’t recall them really ever bringing up much important stuff regarding their parents, regardless of whether they’re dead or alive. With no parental figures to keep the sibling’s mishaps at bay, the story basically sets itself up for disaster from the very get-go. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, which I probably won’t be able to cover entirely, cause that’s how dreadful the situation is.<br />
---------------<br />
The big brother character here, Yuu Nagami, is an ordinary high schooler aspiring to become an LN author; however, his efforts have been unsuccessful up to this point, all because he doesn’t make enough “little sister” type characters. (Okay, wtf, not every god damn good story needs an imouto character, ffs!). Predictably enough, the latest contest was won by none other than Suzuka, his own little sister.<br />
Here’s the problem, Suzuka can’t accept the prize for winning because revealing her true identity to the public eye would ruin her reputation in school and toward her parents (who shouldn’t really care that much, anyway). So what does she do? She convinces Yuu to assume as the identity of “Towano Chikai” in her place, and keep that identity for an undefined period of time. This kind of setup can only go wrong, and then some….<br />
Throughout the entirety of the show, it wasn’t made clear if the series wasn’t trying to be a parody show or trying to be anything serious. Either way, whatever the case, it fails to be any one of the two, or even a combination of the two. It is a messy assortment of events where Yuu and/or Suuzuka is subjected to numerous absurd situations and events, which are usually started up by the handful of ubquitious and recurring support characters. There is no sense of story progression whatsoever; it seems that each episode tries to focusing on coming up with a painfully awkward or stupid gag or trope, seemingly trying to conjure up some sort of “positive” comedy value, which is practically non-existent after at most the first two episodes. The physical settings themselves don’t help much, if at all; the typical school campus, anime convention areas, and those obligatory scenes that just beg for fanservice…aren’t exactly complementary or appealing in terms of trying to keep the viewers from being bored. The show then tries to implement some sort of setup for intended serious drama or conflict between the sister and the brother near the end; however, due to the lack of story progression, as mentioned earlier, as well as the lack of complexity and structure in the narrative (if there really is any at all to begin with), the forced drama comes off as just an extremely weak and nonsensical attempt to conclude what was already an aimless and pointless plot.<br />
<br />
SOUND/ANIMATION: 1/10<br />
Regarding of whatever the explanation is, given the way how it went, there is no half-decent excuse for how the animation quality just dip down like a stock market crash. Honestly, the character designs weren’t necessarily awful at the very beginning, but as the series went along, it’s as if the animation staff themselves have gotten sick and/or bored of the show’s cringe-fest premises and non-existent story progression (which I can totally understand, if that was really the case….though I’m not someone who knows everything behind the scenes). The result? Utterly “fugly” animation quality. With each following episode, the characters just seem to become more and more deformed, to the point where one can say it’s legitimately laborious to even take a glance at them. The clear laziness or lack of motivation of the animation staff is so apparent here, and considering it’s the same studio whom did another infamous and “turrible” show called Hajimete no Gal, it makes a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
The soundtracks aren’t really that downright awful, but they’re at most half-decent….nothing really memorable that you’d want to download onto your PC, iPod, or any similar device. The voice acting is rather lackluster and feels very fabricated in nature, even with the intended fanservice and comedic moments (or moments intended to be comedic, to restate that). I really felt like I should’ve had a drinking contest for each time someone in the show says “onii-chan” or “onii-san (O-Nissan)”, despite me not being an individual with a liking for alcoholic beverages.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 0/10<br />
Yes, once again. BIG. FAT. ZERO.<br />
Not only the characters are one-dimensional, they’re so generic in a bad way and are pretty much written horribly; I wanted to believe that the bad writing for them was intentional to function as part of a parody. They seem to be just made simply for the sakes of stressing the pointless gags and absurd situations centering around the notorious tropes of the “imouto” genre. The interpersonal dialogue among them feels dead and/or forced for the most part, and ultimately doesn’t achieve anything in terms of giving any sort of positive characterization.<br />
This is pretty much the rundown of the recurring cast:<br />
<br />
Suzuka is the “perfectionist” little sister who wants her big brother to do her, but is wishy-washy anyways when related subjects are mentioned, anyways.<br />
<br />
Yuu is the practically useless big brother who has to overreact to literally every single statement or remark thrown at him from the members of his self-forming harem.<br />
<br />
Reika is the typical bossy MILF (possibly) novel editor, and the gag with her is her self-declared solutions are to have Yuu grope her cow tits “for research”.<br />
<br />
Ahegao Double Peace Sensei (yes, she has cow tits, too, I know) is the annoying ero-novel illustrator who won’t shut the hell up about her nickname and her fetishes. <br />
<br />
Mai is that one overly rich girl intended as a love rival and pretty much just an addition to the self-made harem around Yuu.<br />
<br />
Sakura is yet another annoying addition to the harem who only wants to be Yuu’s “imouto” (and won’t frigging stop referring to him as “oni-san”), much to Suzuka’s chargrin, and ultimately an obligated catalyst for the drama attempt near the end of the show.<br />
<br />
The Kanzaka twins are honestly the only characters I did try to like, but in the end, they’re really just the typical twins with contrasting personalities and preferences, and are merely just part of the collective friend circle. They, of course, like the rest of the recurring female cast here, also showed obvious signs of wanting (or kinda wanting, at least) the “Johnson” of you-know-who.<br />
<br />
In short, these characters are not only generic and cliché (which isn’t necessarily bad by itself), but also poorly written and managed.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 1.5/10<br />
For the first few episodes, I legitimately did try to enjoy it, and it did have its comedic value at one point, but not for very long. Honestly, I was hoping at least to find entertainment in poking fun and calling out the numerous shenanigans in the show. However, as the animation quality fell, the story progression becoming non-existent, and the characters becoming more and more obnoxious, it went to the point where I could no longer physically record reactions to the episodes as an YouTube anime reactor. Watching a new episode every week actually became pretty much a legitimate chore, to where I’ve really had my obligation to “never drop unless it becomes 100%+ unbearable or tasteless” really tested. <br />
<br />
This is one of those shows where I can actually say is “objectively bad” in all facets, and to where I felt grateful to have at least watched the likes of Eromanga Sensei (another recent, more well-known “imouto” show), which, while understandbly flawed, functioned a lot better in terms of character management, story-writing, and animation quality.<br />
An even better alternative for an actually good “imouto” show would be Imouto sae Ireba Ii (A Sister’s All You Need). The cast of that show consist of more physically mature characters but with more realistic traits and personal issues. The gags are also much better and more well-executed, and more of the focus in the show is on the characterization of the cast, which worked well even without a deep story. The characters also have more life to them in terms of their interpersonal dialogue and unfiltered remarks, comments, etc.<br />
While I don’t think I’ve watched enough “imouto” shows to literally make a public political statement about how I feel about them, I can safely say that this particular series is one of the worst shows I’ve ever watched in general.<br />
<br />
FINAL WORD:<br />
This show is not worth your time, regardless if you’re a casual and/or open-minded viewer.<br />
Avoid this dumpster like the plague at ALL COSTS.<br />
There are WAY better shows of the same variety out there.<br />
If you hate doing chores, heed my warning. Save your time while you can.<br />
Remember….YOU’VE BEEN WARNED.<br />
<br />
My work is done here.

    As someone who enjoyed Oreimo and, to a lesser extent, Eromanga Sensei, I felt a strong desire to watch this series. The synopsis of the series jived with the aforementioned titles. I also know the subject matter (sibling love/incest) is utter trash. This review is not an attempt to compare the series, but rather provide my opinion on a series that seemed promising before the season began. I typically will wait until a series has concluded, but in this case I felt it necessary to review what I&#039;ve seen from this particular series through present.<br />
<br />
Story (5): Mediocre sums it up pretty well. It is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293414">
        run of the mill brother/sister relationship story with the anime/manga industry serving as a vessel for their relationship to grow. It is in line with Oreimo and Eromanga Sensei where a little sister is unexpectedly involved with some sort of &quot;otaku&quot; practice. The brother serves as a intermediary to either hide or foster the younger sister&#039;s activities. Constants and variables. Through 4 epsiodes, nothing has stood out to differentiate this series from its genre-related counterparts.<br />
<br />
Art (1): This is where my compulsion to write an early review was sparked. The art in this series is SO BAD. The animation is choppy and &quot;melty&quot;; and character design is hardly consistent. Facial expressions leave characters cross-eyed or lazy-eyed, and faces widen and narrow in simple movements. General anatomy is a mess. There has not been an episode where these glaring animation defects aren&#039;t present. There is no artistic flow and everything feels like an afterthought or plainly, rushed. After episode 2, I wanted to believe that it would get better, but has not done so. In fact, it appears to be getting worse. Visually, this has been one of the worst anime I have seen in some time. To be fair, there are scenes where the animation team put in great effort and characters are drawn well and aesthetically pleasing ONLY to make the scenes horizontally (like flipped 90 degrees) and basically wipe their good efforts out. It&#039;s infuriating to watch this show.<br />
<br />
Sound (4): Decent. Nothing astounding about the music or voice acting. Older brother has a generic voice, and little sister has a very dere dere voice. The other characters have voices. Openings and endings are forgettable.<br />
<br />
Character (5): Mediocre. As with the story, the characters are pretty run of the mill. Apart from the siblings, the supporting characters are all other members of the industry: author, editor, illustrator, voice actress. The supporting characters add to the older brother&#039;s harem. It&#039;s all stuff we&#039;ve seen before and is kind of tired at this point.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (5): All said, I am a sucker for this garbage genre and there are parts of the show I enjoy. I do like the overall design of Suzuka and Mai&#039;s characters. The execution is what kills it. I did enjoy the first couple episodes enough to continue this series, but am otherwise disappointed with its progress. It&#039;s kind of slow. I will continue to watch going forward and will adjust my enjoyment rating accordingly. However, the past few episodes have been plainly boring and I am admittedly falling asleep while watching. Overall enjoyment remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
Overall (4): It&#039;s nothing special, but it isn&#039;t awful. If the animation wasn&#039;t as bad as it is, it would probably drive my rating over 5. Even mediocre animation would make the show more enjoyable. Certain things just can&#039;t be ignored. As I mentioned before, watching this show be a visual failure makes me irate. If you watch this show, just keep in mind that the animation leaves A LOT to be desired and even then that could be an understatement. If you are able to ignore these failings the show could be very enjoyable to watch -- especially if you are a fan of the genre. Just be warned.

    This review contains spoilers<br />
I really hate this kind of anime which is made to exploit the current anime landscape. It copies what&#039;s popular but it has horrible production value.<br />
<br />
Plot<br />
Nagami Suzuka is in love with his brother not a sisterly love but a I WANT YOUR DICK that kind of love.So she want to the world to accept their love but how does she do that by of course writing a novel about incest.but she cant publish it because novel authors can be anonymous ? Right ?<br />
.So his brother takes her place. The plot is stupid and dosent make any sence.They are plot hole every were.The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342247">
        plot feels like something I would write.Wich is not a good thing.<br />
<br />
Why can&#039;t a writer be anonymous ?<br />
There is a scene where the protagonist is threatened by a rival writer that she will reveal his(protagonist) secrets to the school unless he listens to her.The protagonist can easily say that he can also reveal her secret. But he just agrees to listen to her.<br />
<br />
They tried to copy other anime but failed badly,the plot is just stupid.<br />
<br />
The dialogue is so bad.here is an example of the dialogue of this show.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#039;m a huge fan! Please give me your autograph!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#039;re a fan... a fan of my... ? This is humiliating. I&#039;m the one who wants an autograph!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, what do you mean, you want my autograph?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you even listening to me? I want your autograph!&quot;<br />
&quot;Y-you want my autograph? B-but why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#039;t that obvious? I&#039;m a huge fan of yours, Towano.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hawuuuhhhh??&quot;<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
I think they had a checkbox while writing the characters. And they wanted to put every cliche in the checkbox.The characters are very boring and shallow.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound design is terrible.I don&#039;t know Japanese but the voice acting is so bad.It feels like a bad school play.I think they went online and just took some random royalty free piano notes and just ran them in the background.Sometime there are no background sound.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I lost 3 brain cells while watching this anime.The art looks terrible. Characters&#039; faces are not drawn correctly.Sometimes the little sisters face looks like a goblin.The animation quality is so stiff and bad.There are a lot of awkward cuts.It just feels unnatural.The background art looks terrible.I dont know why but sometime the camera angle just flips.The characters facial expression dosent make any sense.Proportions arnt correct.This art is just a hot mess.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
This is a pain to watch.The only time I enjoyed this anime when they introduced a character named &quot;Ahegao Double Peace-sensei&quot; not because she is a good character but because of her ridiculous name.who names their character Ahegao Double Peace-sensei.<br />
<br />
Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai is the worst anime that i watched.I wish i could just forget about this anime .<br />
<br />
I am new to reviewing anime so any feedback will be very nice.<br />
and sorry for any grammatical mistakes that I make.

(Another “Little Sister loves Big Brother, but She must Keep these Feelings to Herself because it’s Taboo” Series)<br />
<br />
Have you ever looked into a trashcan and though, “I want to jump into that filth?” Well, imagine this show being a trashcan, and me, being a curious onlooker who notices a bright and shinny object. I immediately recognize that object and, without hesitation, I jump into the trashcan. Now, what is this bright and shinny object, you might ask? It’s this: ‘the feeling that one knows that they’re about to watch a garbage masterpiece about incest.’<br />
<br />
Generic ‘Incest’ series checklist:<br />
<br />
- Long title that forms a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296157">
        sentence and can be condensed into an abbreviation<br />
- Contains these genres (i.e., Comedy, Romance, and/or ecchi)<br />
- Its source material is from a light novel<br />
- The plot features a story about an older brother and little sister, who may or may not be blood-related<br />
- The thumbnail/cover features the little sister and older brother duo with potentially other female characters<br />
<br />
Yep, this series seem to have all the hallmark signs of a typical ‘incest’ show. Just what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
Summary: Little sister, i.e., Suzuka Nagami, writes an awarding-winning light novel about a ‘little sister character’ loving her ‘older brother’. Surprised and shocked that she won the award, she ask her older brother, i.e., Yu Nagami, to step in as the author who wrote that awarding-winning light novel. Upon acting as the stand-in author, Yu’s life becomes much more hectic.<br />
<br />
It’s a lovely story about a little sister trying to more than just a “little sister”.  Watch as she demonstrates what a “panchira” means, aka, to catch a brief glimpse of a woman&#039;s underwear, and then actually performing it. Watch her wear a buruma and many other costumes to entice our older brother.<br />
<br />
It’s also a story about an older brother struggling with “lucky pervert” moments. I mean, it’s not his fault for catching his little sister in a bra and panties, and later nude in the shower. Or when he’s forced to put lotion on her or to act all ‘lovey dovey’ with his little sister. Or copping a feel of his little sister’s breast.<br />
<br />
But, more importantly, it’s a story about a bunch girls with huge ‘plots’ surrounding our older brother creating as much fanservice and tropes as possible. We get risqué changing clothes events, a cosplay event, a cultural festival, a breach event, et cetera. I don’t know what else to ask for besides fanservice, fanservice, and more fanservice. It’s just a great series overall.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION:<br />
<br />
The character designs are outstanding, anybody that says otherwise just doesn’t understand art. I mean, who doesn’t love character designs that feature many distorted eyes that appear to look in different directions? Also, who doesn’t love watching cross-eyed or derpy face characters having a long and boring conversation?<br />
<br />
The animations are amazing. Have you noticed that there are many still shots? Well, it’s true, however most of the budget is being used to animate Ahegao’s self-propelled breasts, actually, the animators will animate anything that involves breasts or any other suggestive body parts.<br />
<br />
And finally, the camera shots and angles are fantastic. Have noticed that there many panty, breast/chest, goin, and ass shots? How about the many look-down-the-shirt scenes? I mean, it’s to be expected as a fanservice show. But, I have to give props to whoever suggested the idea of adding those strange 90 degree camera shots in Episode 3 and 8. They really wanted to break my neck with shots!<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
The show’s music is impressively unimpressive. The background music is just there to add more sound. The opening song, your typical J-Pop, features images that displays the main characters one-by-one, whereas the ending song, also J-Pop, features scenes from the corresponding episode. How original! Truly amazing music!<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: <br />
<br />
Both our main characters, Yu Nagami and Suzuka Nagami, are perfect in every way. They are the perfect example of what one-dimensional characters should be, i.e., a lack of redeeming qualities, and I congratulate whoever created these characters. The supporting cast is also perfect as they serve the purpose of increasing the amount of fanservice in each episode. Most of the supporting cast has a huge ‘plot’, so much so that it takes up almost every moment of this show.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
<br />
What a great and brilliant show! I enjoyed this garbage masterpiece from the day it aired. I loved its simplistic, ‘hinted’ incest story with its main focus about the ‘plot’. I loved its shitty art from its unexceptional character designs to its lazy and minimal background designs. I loved its stiff animations and its questionable camera angles and shots, especially the scenes when I’m forced to turn my head 90 degrees and when panty shots are shoved into my face. I loved its one-dimensional characters and their lack of redeeming qualities. And finally, I loved its lack of resolution, an unresolved ending is the best ending. Everyone should watch this series, it’s a masterpiece in the making.

    I can&#039;t give extremely poor overall ratings, but there were some serious flaws here that need to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime was enjoyable, can&#039;t argue there. It gave a few laughs, has enough eye candy for the ecchi-hearted people. The character voicing wasn&#039;t annoying (as is in some anime). But good GOD the character design was awful... There are certain angles that the animation studio could not get right for the life of them... For some reason side shots look fine, but straight-on shots look absolutely horrendous. But at the same time, there&#039;s certain scenes where the straight-facing characters look completely normal and well made.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308805">
        It&#039;s like they split the work among different departments and they all animated certain sections and put the thing together. Some failed harder than others...<br />
<br />
Story-wise, it was all right. Can&#039;t complain about development for anime like these because they are not long-running series like Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, etc. This particular anime kinda hit a soft spot for me. I always wished I had a little sister. I really wished the main character would have actually been more friendly w/ his sister. If I had a little sister, romance or not, I would definitely make some precious memories w/ her and not have to wait for some massive change in lifestyle for that to happen.

    I think at this point, we&#039;ve had enough of incest shows (with the exception of OreImo which is STILL the best of the genre), and this &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to that doesn&#039;t hold a candle to that. But ImoImo in all of its debunkery, is not just to showcase the harsh conditions of the anime industry as a whole, but also what if new, amateur people were to really give their all and see ALL that effort be wasted. It&#039;s a DOA-confirmed position, and TRASH at its finest.<br />
<br />
When Hajimete no Gal director Hiroyuki Furukawa first announced this project, it seemed like any other generic series that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296154">
        is already flooded with a lot of upcoming trash and brillant others out there. And...not to mention that with his newly-founded studio Magia Doraglier to help the underpaid staff be relieved of that heavy weight on their shoulders. And the result? Quite a no-brainer as about completely this series was heavily outsourced, not handled by the main studio NAZ but by even smaller studios that try too hard just to make it into production. I mean, come on, even before this series had started, the 1st brickwall of production woes should immediately raise a big red flag, seriously an abject failure in complete fashion. Heck, even a hidden cry in the series warrants a very shocking (but not surprised) on-set look. (Go read the series forum for more info.)<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, what is ImoImo all about (aside from that ridiculous long name)?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s your run-of-the-mill average bro/sis-con show, much like OreImo (but failed hard) with the same premise as Eromanga-sensei, just that the male MC Yuu Nagami (the brother) is working in his sister&#039;s stead (Suzuka) in order to help her cover up the fact that young people are not eligible to pass off as manga authors (rule established). And...it&#039;s basically how OreImo is with the passing-off of characters, both friends and rivals, playing comparison games and showing off their &quot;truly wunderful&quot; emotions and feelings, as a means of resort to play around with. Point 1: If you&#039;re looking for a story, there&#039;s none here.<br />
<br />
Well then, how about the characters themselves? Starting off with bro/sis family Yuu and Suzuka, again, it is reminded of how Kirino and Kyousuke were, just that the chemistry within both differs a hella lot, where as the former always tries ways to reach to consensus each and everytime with their consultations, the latter just knocks it off in the worst way possible. Ahegao Double Peace-sensei is of every word, like Saori, the mostly enthusiastic but calm and collected ones in the face of trouble. And then...rivals (or troublemakers as I&#039;d like to call them) like Sakura and the Kanzaka sisters&#039; Akino are nothing but more fuel adding on to the fire (Yeah! Plus one for Yuu&#039;s harem), and are totally nothing of how Ruri was (strong but scared and afraid when alone, and needed Kyousuke&#039;s help). If you noticed how bad was the drawings on the character models, here comes the biggest elephant of all.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is seriously a very good list of balderdash decisions of how NOT to make your production bad (or at least attempt a proper cover-up), at least by 2018 technical standpoints. From the start, can you relate to this: Side-shots that had us tilting our heads and damaging our necks in the process (this is utterly painful), character models (especially the facial expressions) that look like a 4th or 5th grader&#039;s drawings, the ever-so-slightly drawings that in separate cutscenes have stuff that either exists or not then reverts to vice versa for no reasons, etc. If this was the reason of escapism that the higher management (e.g. Hiroyuki Furukawa) himself had envisioned for the people under him, then he&#039;s clearly had the whole industry issue badly misunderstood. I believe that under a decent studio (say Diomedea or Silver Link) this crisis of a disaster would have been averted IMO. But it is what it is, and it&#039;s clearly the bottom of the barrel.<br />
<br />
The music...uh, I don&#039;t really know how to feel about this, let&#039;s just say that it&#039;s really quite forgettable. Not just the OST, but even the voice acting. Fairly new VA Reina Kondou&#039;s act as Suzuka is really OK, given that she performs decently as well for Hana in Slow Start. And OMG Tasuku Hatanaka, why are you given the role of Yuu? Your voice for My HeroAca&#039;s Kaminari and Ushio to Tora&#039;s MC Ushio is very iconic, it&#039;s such a shame, really. The biggest shame is the VAs given how much they try to imitate the roles for the characters here, as the anime is truly deep shit. The OST is also best in generic generosity, both OP and ED with many misses than hits.<br />
<br />
Overall, in reality, Hiroyuki Furukawa&#039;s vision is something to be noted, and props for him for directing this anime which he did the character designs and being the chief animation director, that is hampered by outsourced work, and what we got was an anime that was truly, madly and deeply unwatchable. You tried hard, Furukawa-san, sorry you could have tried harder. As for the TL;DR though, don&#039;t ever watch this trash of a piece. It does injustice for everything that&#039;s tied to it...and I don&#039;t ever wanna watch it again, really. Just skip this piece of garbage and you&#039;ll have a better time. If you did, I&#039;m sorry, just watch any other anime you&#039;ll like as a cure to this virus.

    After I watch this anime. I like the storyline.. its not bored at all. Seems pretty fun. I like the character design. And all of the seiyuu&#039;s are the best. I enjoy this so much. But I think the man character need more giving his love for his imouto. I&#039;am not a siscon. <br />
<br />
For another reason why like this anime:<br />
 It&#039;s because I love they eyes. Like it&#039;s familiar but it&#039;s not.  <br />
 I like this anime because this is not Harem. But I think the ova it&#039;s harem. <br />
<br />
<br />
I wrote this review for you guys, who like to have a little sister. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334241">
        you don&#039;t. Or you have but... You know.<br />
<br />
<br />
I watched the ova version too, but I think the ova version it&#039;s not that good as the TV version. Because in the ova they playing game and.. being harem or I don&#039;t know..

    Oh my lord where should I start?<br />
<br />
One of the best Ecchi I have watched without a doubt. Nothin can be compaared to this Masterpiece.<br />
<br />
The Soundtracks are on-point probably the best thing the anime industrie had seen. The soundtracks were always used on proper situations also the choice was almost perfect. 10/10.<br />
<br />
Story is a bit unusal thats why I enyoed it so much.  It has a clear and complex storyline.  Ecchi, emotions, onii-chan what do you want more? 10/10<br />
<br />
oh man oh man let me say somthing. The drawings are incredible high quality but the mouth movement could be more accurate 9/10<br />
<br />
Overall I like this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373418">
        anime, people might say I have a trash taste but lets be honest, if we are going to watch shit i expect shit. And because of that i love this piece of art &lt;3.<br />
<br />
This review is a trash review.<br />
<br />

    A daring sibling rom-com. Make no mistake, this is a flirty, teenage type blushing comedy in appearance only, it quickly takes a turn into the gutter with some very risqué and downright erotic themes and scenes. If you&#039;re looking for a story with depth or solid comedy, you&#039;re better off watching other similar shows. If I had to say something bad about the show it would be the lines. Dialogue is bland and predictable with plenty of phrases and scenes you&#039;ve seen a million times already and even then there&#039;s nothing special about how it&#039;s done here. The low effort comedy shows in this one,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293426">
        making it very difficult for cast members to make conversations, that seem good on paper, shine. Of all the weak points of the show, the one I can&#039;t forgive is the dull conversations that drag on too long and all seem to emphasize the same situations which get recycled every week. The cast is somewhat unique, but fails to charm us with many one dimensional personalities. Art is colorful and creative, but lacks noticeable depth that makes this feel like you&#039;re playing a 2D video game. You may feel you&#039;re stuck in the past with the blocky art, or as others may be familiar with, it feels like the characters are stuck in a 4 panel manga. Animation is painful to watch, mostly because the art makes the flaws stand out. The soundtrack is effective, but a bit too simple to truly enjoy. It often feels like background noise. If I had to say something good about this show it would be the creative character designs. characters have a pleasant sense of style and come adorned with all manner of cute details and accessories most other shows would skip on. Voice acting is enthusiastic even if the lines they&#039;re given make it impossible for them to deliver quality moments. A unique color palette makes for unique imagery in both characters and all art. Backgrounds are done very well.<br />
<br />
Overall we have a high school story with a smutty theme that gets unexpectedly dirty and feeds off the uncomfortable atmosphere. At it&#039;s worst it&#039;s just another SoL with an awful visual quality to it, at best it just might just be your guilty pleasure that you&#039;re too ashamed to admit to anyone that you secretly love. It just can&#039;t overcome the flaws that come with neglecting the 2 senses: sight and sound. They amplify other flaws and make for a show that leaves you searching for good in it. The big problem the show has is there are many satisfying cute and romancey scenes, but they get mixed in with raunchy scenes just as often. It makes for a romantic feel that never lasts and constantly gets interrupted by nonsense and antics. You might enjoy moments of the show, but it&#039;s a pain getting to the good part. I give it a 6/10. If you actually enjoy this even a tiny bit, I recommend trying out the LN version.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Version: Cute/erotic hybrid rom-com with disappointing characters.2D feel ruins it for people here for the funny/cute//hot moments. Erase browsing history after watching.

    Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai is a poorly animated mess embroiled in controversies over never paying its animation staff among other things. It tells an outdated story from 6 years back when this sort of thing was popular. And yet. In spite of it all, this was one of the most enjoyable shows I&#039;ve had the pleasure of watching this season. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but somehow, one way or another, this show manages to be supremely fun to follow. Maybe it&#039;s the absurd storyline, in which a brocon sister desperately tries to bone her dense onii-chan. Maybe it&#039;s the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296707">
        surprisingly excellent performance by Koudou Reina who despite being a newcomer in this trash fire still manages to give it her all in all of her scenes. Maybe it&#039;s the appeal of seeing Ogura Yui voice someone who doesn&#039;t have helium shoved in her throat. Maybe it&#039;s because the horrendous animation quality ironically gives the anime a lot of charm, kind of like how a sad puppy in the rain is inherently cuter than an angry German Shepherd on your throat. Or maybe it&#039;s how Suzuka and onii-chan look like victims of inbreeding themselves and ironically gives the show a &quot;cautionary tale&quot; vibe to it.<br />
<br />
Nothing in this whole show is competent or makes a whole lotta sense. And yet, I can&#039;t get mad at it, even with its absurdities, or how the studio is alleged to not pay its staff, or its subject matter. It&#039;s just fun. And how do you even quantify fun. I&#039;m a miserable accountant, what do I know about fun.<br />
<br />
The real joy, in this show, is not knowing what to expect next. Of course I&#039;m not talking about how the plot will unravel over the upcoming episodes, I&#039;m talking about how much the anime will melt as the series goes on. The show continues to exceed expectations and I can&#039;t fault it for that. Hadüki would be proud. <br />
<br />
4/10 Enjoyable dumb fun.<br />
<br />
And at the end of the day, it&#039;s still better than Release The Spyce.

    LA will be straight with ya here, this is a trainwreck...that crashed into a dumpster fire.<br />
<br />
Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai or My Sister, My Writer is an anime that tries to follow in the footsteps of Eromanga-sensei and the trendsetter OreImouto, but Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai is one of those siscon shows that is sooo un-selfaware of what it&#039;s trying to do it fails on it&#039;s OWN genre&#039;s strengths that puts itself in the main focus!, let&#039;s not even get to the horrible animation that is the LEAST of it&#039;s problems...yeah it&#039;s THAT bad.<br />
<br />
Ore

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296198">
        ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai&#039;s basic premise is that Suzuka Nagami has hidden her work under Chikai Towano where she write light novels in the genre of siscon, the thing is she makes her brother Yuu as the proxy author as Chikai Towano, harem hijinks ensues....hmmm where has LA heard this premise before?...*cough* Eromanga-sensei *cough*<br />
<br />
Ok, so Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai&#039;s plot follows many of the typical siscon harem animes in which many of trend setters predecessors has implemented only it fails on MANY fronts and makes even the typical cliches, seem both disingenuous, blatant and desperate in it&#039;s cliches which fails continuously. Everything from the dense main male protagonist and this one Yuu Nagami voiced by Tasuku Hatanaka almost freakin&#039; surpasses Ichika from Infinite Stratos in his denseness, Suzuka Nagami the main female protagonist and the titular sister of the anime feels more like a caricature of Sagiri Izumi from Eromanga-sensei, being an extremely popular writer but has her identity hidden to their brothers as well as being extremely tsundere towards them, just swap illustration to writing and we have Suzuka. We also have the typical harem elements and like our brother and sister are pretty one note or just not developed enough, we have Ahegao W Peace-sensei voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki an illustrator for Chikai Towano, but she&#039;s the erratically lustful character, Mai Himuro voiced by Yui Ogura, the tsundere rival to Chikai Towano who quite obviously has a crush on Yuu but her stalkering ways might get Suzuka and Yuu in trouble and finally Sakura Miazuki voiced by Kazusa Aranami, a rookie voice actor who REALLY likes Chikai Towano&#039;s work to the point of her wanting to land the role as Chikai Towano&#039;s latest work as the little sister...of course. Look besides Ahegao W Peace-sensei, LA didn&#039;t care about ANY of these characters as just how one note the majority of the characters are with Yuu and Suzuka being the worst as they feel like a worse version of Sagiri and Masamune from Eromanga-sensei just with NONE of the charm and cliches that&#039;s been done a hundred times already. The worst character for LA to be targeted to how one note they are but actually had something there but wasted it would have been Mai but no, she&#039;s the typical tsundere rival, nothing new has been done with her, ever oblivious, ever tsundere with no change, damn shame. The only reason Ahegao W Peace-sensei is the exception is because she DEVELOPS and not stay static, sure she probably has the foulest mouth of all the characters but it&#039;s better than bland and cliched.<br />
<br />
So Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai un-selfawareness...just wow, LA hasn&#039;t seen an anime this not self-aware of itself and almost feeling like it&#039;s insulting it&#039;s own genre it&#039;s suppose to be praising. Ok so in Ahegao W Peace-sensei&#039;s arc, we have a competition in doujinshi, no the competition is based on quality or best story or illustrations. No it&#039;s based on sales...what. Why does this cause of no self awareness?...because not only does it feel like a cry for help from the anime itself of trying to say &quot;hey buy us..or we&#039;ll lose!&quot;, but in-universe, these kind of competitions, you know author vs. author or illustrator vs. illustrator has MORE to do with quality than sales, sure anime has done it about sales at times, but the overall execution was about whether the competitor was about whether the author has improved through quality, in making the best they can, however Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai seems more worried about sales. LA might have been thinking too much about this arc but the irony is bitter. Hell Sakura&#039;s reasoning for involving herself to the Yuu makes no sense either, as Sakura hated how clingy and possessive her siscon loving brother was, but with Chikai Towano&#039;s work she realized that his brother actions were fine...WHAT THE F-...this is considering how Suzuka&#039;s work and Suzuka herself is EXACTLY the same as Sakura&#039;s brother acts like so Sakura loving Chikai Towano&#039;s work makes NO sense let alone her problems with her brother resolving just like that making no sense either...just wow the level of incompetency and self awareness is astounding!.<br />
<br />
Also can LA note that as much as Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai apes it&#039;s own genre&#039;s cliches to high heaven, the cliches it uses, feels almost like an insult to it as how disingenuous it executes itself, almost feels like a person who hated siscon shows directed the entire show. Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai pretty much gives us nothing and you leave with nothing...<br />
<br />
So Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai&#039;s biggest and major reasoning why Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai even got any press while Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai was being released in Fall 2018 was the horrible off model in had in EVERY episode. See Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai&#039;s animation studio at first was NAZ, however Doraglier later joined, so you&#039;d expect them to help with key framing and whatnot, well they tried but even with another animation studio, nope the quality kept deteriorating even further even to the point of even the fanservice moments bleed in making it pretty unwatchable. Heck the animators unnamed used the credit pseudonym as a cry for help saying &quot;Honestly I&#039;m screwed&quot;. The animation done by NAZ and Doraglier is outright horrible but it has some few rare moments where it&#039;s fluid with NO derps....for a couple seconds. Just wow, what a trainwreck. Did LA mention that Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai got delayed twice!, once BEFORE THE INITIAL RELEASE and the second time they delayed it the animation was still a dumpster fire. Ohh by the way all this happened from the SECOND EPISODE ONWARDS. Just...fucking. WOW.<br />
<br />
So is there ANY redeeming features about Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai about it?. -sigh- LA feels REALLY sorry about the voice cast, because as much as the deteriorating animation and no self-aware cliched to hell plot the voice actors were subjected to, they kinda did the best of their ability, from Reina Kondou as Suzuka to freakin&#039; Chinatsu Akasaki as Ahegao who took her role in strides and heck LA will give Yui Ogura some props in her playing against the type somewhat yet being the typical tsundere role. So anything else worth redeeming?. Nope.<br />
<br />
Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai is an anime that died before it even freakin&#039; started. Major production issues that utterly cripples it&#039;s animation to high heaven, plot that is as cliched riddled with NO charm of it&#039;s predecessors with it&#039;s one note bland characters we&#039;ve seen in much better siscon shows with charm, with the simple thing as character development and risk. Look LA knows that Eromanga-sensei and Imouto sae Ireba Ii. by an extent have their problems as a siscon show, but Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai pales in comparison to the mountains of problems and flaws that it has that makes Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai pretty unsalvageable. <br />
<br />
Conception had a quirky premise but was consistent but didn&#039;t know what to do with it&#039;s source material without doing it&#039;s main strengths to his fullest potential but it has a quirky fun potential to it, Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi was a janky animation mess and rushed to all hell, but it was a trainwreck that LA wanted to see it burn in a soo bad that it&#039;s good kinda a way. Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai on the other hand has NONE of these qualities, it&#039;s not a so bad it&#039;s good, it&#039;s quirkiness and charm was almost non existent, it had no potential to salvage itself and it felt like Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai didn&#039;t like itself either. Nothing went right with Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai and what little rare times it did something right was already too late and quite easily is LA&#039;s worst anime of Fall 2018 and ohh boy it might be a contender for the worst anime of 2018 as well. Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai is a dumpster fire to which LA wouldn&#039;t even give to LA&#039;s worst enemies to torture with. Curious?, well for the deteriorating animation fine, but anything else, stay well away.<br />
<br />
Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai is like it&#039;s animation, people&#039;s neck&#039;s don&#039;t twist like that.....dead on arrival.

    Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai (2018)<br />
<br />
STORY: <br />
<br />
A beautiful sister and an average brother who live in a general life. The brother wants to be an author and the sister is a model student. She is also a Bro-Con which is made very apparent. Due to her school rules and the backlash potential she has her brother who isn’t a very good writer stand in for her when she submits a novel which is about her, and wins (secretly without telling the brother that it is about her desires). He then gains a harem situation of people who admire his work

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315330">
        for the good and bad reasons with him and the sister keeping the truth hidden. As the story progresses feelings become stronger until a climax. It is somewhat similar to Eromanga-sensei is many aspects of the basic story and the archetype of the characters also matches in well with Oreimo. Both of which are great series.  <br />
<br />
ART: <br />
<br />
The art throughout is pretty average of the industry but unfortunately at many occasions the quality just drops off the page. It feels like the team didn’t enjoy the work as it is not quality controlled very well or perhaps it was rushed, maybe both. Unfortunately, when the quality drops especially noticeable in the brother and sister who you see all the time it really is noticeable. It ruins a bit what is a good trash series. <br />
<br />
SOUND: <br />
<br />
The OP is a catchy tune and the ED is also pretty good.<br />
General sound used is good but sometimes feels very much like they used a store of pre-recorded reactions in some cases. <br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: <br />
<br />
Characters develop quite well. The sister and brother have the expected development. Many past events suddenly come up and the climax reaches the expected outcome in this trash.<br />
The other characters are developed quite well at times but then suddenly drop off the face of the earth leaving you wonder what is happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: <br />
<br />
The show for a trash lover like myself is not bad, it is overall a good enough series to watch. It is however let down massively by the art used. I always take the incest is wincest scenario with a pinch of salt because it is an anime not real life. Just like some movies with 20-mile runways etc.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
<br />
Overall the show is good if you are trashy. If you liked Oreimo or Eromanga-sensei and are willing to watch a slightly worse made version with the same tropes then you should give this a try. <br />

    Fuck this anime. This is easily the worst anime i have ever seen. SAO is like a fucking god when compared due to this shit.<br />
<br />
Story-1<br />
I am not gonna bother writing the complete synopsis but the basic story at its core is about a little sister who wants to fuck his brother. Now the little sister writes a light novel to get famous and make her relationship acceptable. Thing is it somehow works and nobody questions the questionable relationship of a brother and his sister. But wait- there&#039;s a twist , she&#039;s too shy so her brother has to go pose as the author and ends

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300664">
        up getting a harem for no reason. Ill elaborate on this harem later.<br />
<br />
Art-1<br />
What kind of people animated this ? This has to be some of the worst animation i have ever seen with in some scenes the MC looking like a fucking giraffe (credit to my friend who i showed a picture of that abomination to). It seems like that a studio did one scene a random beginner studio animated it and than passed it on to another beginner studio to take a break and the studio kept on doing the same thing . The anatomy is like one drawn by a 11 year old kid who does art class. Oh and there is this one guy who appears in some episode who looks like he is from a completely different anime or cartoon or comic strip from the 20s etc etc.<br />
<br />
Sound-1 <br />
The soundtrack is extremely forgettable so bad and the opening kinda haunts me with how annoying it is (all be it its visuals are kinda ok). The ED sounds alright i guess . The voice actors made a basic performance which is boring and nothing notable.<br />
<br />
Character-1 <br />
Oh boy. These characters are terrible . The MC is a bland and dense character. He sometimes pretends to be what the real author of the light novel (which i forgot to mention is about a sister and a brother wanting to fuck each other or something) in which he is loud and a bit- insane and makes his little sister sit on his lap which is just disturbing.Oh and he is as dense as a dozen neutron stars. Other characters include: <br />
*Big titted blonde bitch who&#039;s into BDSM and rape and draws hentai<br />
*The MC&#039;s favorite light novel author who happens to be his crush and the hottest girl in his school and ends up worshiping him basically.<br />
*A Voice actress who wants to be the MC&#039;s little sister and calls him Oni-san or Oni-chan whichever one it is and wants to play his little sister role when the anime of his light novel is made. Side note: She is older than him.<br />
*A slutty editor who often does sexual things to the MC which the MC doesn&#039;t ask for like listening her moan or grope her breasts.<br />
Lastly we come to the little sister who at first described is a perfect middle schooler whose fatal flaw is that she is shy . She comes off as slightly insane to me. My guess is that she is suppose to be cute but uhh she is just a bit insane. Overall the characters are trash.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-1<br />
The characters combined with the animation creates 0 enjoyment. I watched it to see just how bad this could get. Some scenes are stupid and its only attempt at entertaining is usually dumb sexual situations or characters saying something sexual. It also tries to do Drama and fails to make me care for characters considering they end up in dumb situations like in one episode the little sister is sad because she thinks her brother doesn&#039;t like her light novel which forces the MC to say stuff about why he likes her light novel. All and all no enjoyment at all.<br />
<br />
Overall-1<br />
A pathetic anime and the worst one i have ever seen which attempts to capitalize on cliches and tropes with its anime adaptation made by people who have 0 interest in it and seem really overworked and underpaid as their studio is going downhill.<br />
