    Finally, after all these years, the definitive magnum opus of the Japanese anime industry is here. Eva who? Shingeki no what? Redo of healer is unironically one of the best shows in recent memory. It’s not for everyone, in fact it’s probably not for most people. That’s fine. It was for me.<br />
<br />
“You only like Redo because of how edgy it is” Well, you’re not wrong. What makes Kayari so enjoyable is not its story, which is actually pretty good in its own right, but its unique take on the dark fantasy general and how it takes traditional preconceptions of what a MC has to be,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388496">
        and turns them on their head. We have all the same traditional set ups that we’re accustomed to with this genre. JRPG inspired world, OP MC surrounded by a harem of girls, setting out on a quest, etc, ect. Where the series sets itself apart from others is the MCs approach to revenge and life. <br />
<br />
In traditional series like this, you have a MC who is afraid of hurting people, afraid of women and just a beta male in general. What I love about Keyaru is the fact that he just doesn’t give a fuck. He’s not afraid to tear people apart, literally and figuratively, and he reacts how a normal person in his situation would. I love that. What people often forget about when they write negative reviews and talk about the MCs use of rape as a weapon, is the emotional, physical and psychological abuse that he endured at the hands of the people he gets revenge on. Yes, rape is horrible, but in the context of Kayari it is totally understandable from a literary and logical standpoint why its used in the story. <br />
<br />
One negative thing about the anime, is the fact that Keyaru’s desire to not hurt anyone who hasn’t hurt him isn’t emphasised. I think that caused a lot of people to hate him as an MC because of the cut monologues that provide context about his emotional state. While Keyaru is not a good guy in the traditional sense, he is not out to hurt people who have not abused him or hurt his companions. He’s not just out raping and killing people for the sake of it.<br />
<br />
On the animation quality side of things, I think TNK did a better job than I was expecting. The fight scenes are surprisingly well done and the sex scenes are as fluid as you’d hope. I do think the OST was pretty weak, but that’s a rather minor complaint.<br />
<br />
A story that makes you uncomfortable is not necessarily a bad story. Sometimes we need to have our views and ideas challenged, and I think Kayari can provide that for fans of dark fantasy anime/LNs. Again, you know damn well if this show is for you or not. If you’re just gonna have a meltdown about how edgy it is, just stay away. <br />
<br />
Kayari gets 10 heals out of 10.<br />

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve read comments about this being the ultimate masterpiece; that if you disliked this is because you belong to the crystal generation of sensitive onions. Or that “this show is not for normies”. I rather be a normie than a person that praises this. But my question is how can you even feel comfortable while watching this? <br />
<br />
The plot couldn’t be more simple since it is almost a hentai. Hentai don’t need a plot, but this one tried very hard to have one. It’s supposed to be a “dark fantasy”, but instead of being that, it is more like a “your hentai

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377510">
        fantasy”, about a healer guy that gets violented and abused by Flare, a princess. When he gets the chance to remake his life with some powers, he chooses to get revenge instead of looking for a better life this time. No, he prepares himself for years so he could live all over again and survive her abuses and confront her (I’m sorry, I meant ‘rape her’) in order to achieve his revenge. <br />
<br />
What is the problem with the sexual assaults and the plot? Well, let me explain it if you are still not getting it by yourself. A series/anime/movie/book can have rapes and so, because yes, we as a viewer can’t delete that from the media world since it is part of the world’s cruelty. Nevertheless, here’s the problem. For example, when you read Lolita from Vladimir Nabokov (I had to bring it up since it was my recent good read), the pedophile thing is always as polemic as rape, and here it is not normalized and is well settled because that’s the main plot. It is a story told from the nauseous point of view of the pedophile that narrates his sickest fantasies involving a 12 yo. The difference is that Lolita can be enjoyed by normies and by pervs. It is a disturbing plot with some abuse, not an abuse with some plot. It is not made to make the main character look cool nor to make the audience feel satisfied; on the other hand, our beloved Redo anime does pretend that. I can’t recall how many comments I’ve read that said stupid things like “yea, I wish I could rape her too”. Please, ask for help and don’t approach any woman ever.<br />
<br />
If there’s a phrase that really gets on my nerves is the dumb one that this guys use to everything as their safe passage. “It is fiction, why do you care?” Yes, it is fiction, thankfully, of course. Nonetheless, does that solve anything to you? Again, I repeat my question: how can you feel comfortable while watching this? It is fiction, yes, but are you actually enjoying that? If you do, you better go watch a hentai that has the guts to accept it is a hentai, because no one is going to attack that one. I could mention like three literary examples more but we are talking about anime, so I’ll take a chill pill and go on with this. A rape scene is not supposed to be automatically canceled and deleted, because a tragic story can have one and be a piece of art (let’s say, Berserk). While it can’t be easy to watch  for sensitive people (or people that have actually suffered an assault), it still can fit in the story in a good way and can contribute to the story or a character’s background and can enrich the plot. Although, can you unironically afirm this anime does that? Of course not. What Redo of Healer does is to disminish this subject and treat it frivolously, it’s like it actually wants to justify violations. Flare was a trashcan, yes. It is reasonable if the main character wanted to take revenge, yes. Would it have been a little bit more logical if the rape scene had been just implied, or a little more subtle (I mean, without those frames where you can see Flare’s fingers from inside her… you know)? In my opinion, yes, specially if they were going to repeat it so many times. But, oh, no, of course introducing a sensitive theme like a rape must be executed in a 10 minutes scene. Of course they are not trying to disminish the problem with a scene of Flare begging for a dick and touching herself while the guy threatens her to stick her up with a poker! I’m sorry, I’m so boring I just couldn’t enjoy those ten minutes with the delightly sound of her screaming and crying in pain while a macho man is laughing over her. For ten explicit minutes. <br />
<br />
That only prooves my point that all that scene was to capture the virgin audience’s attention. Even a friend of mine admited he was watching this anime just because of sex scenes. And what’s even worse, even when he erases her entire memories, he keeps her as her kind of sex slave/companion. What does that contribute to his revenge? She doesn’t remember anything from her life, nor what she did to him in the past, nor the rape. Then, WAS IT NECESSARY AN EXPLICIT RAPE SCENE? I’m pretty sure it wasn’t. When she wakes up with her memories erased, he convinces her that she was some sort of lover to him. After that she just believes in him and they have sex. Why. Why. Why. What does it add to the plot? Nothing at all. And when she believes in him and has sex with him, he smiles like “haha, I’m so enjoying this revenge”. What revenge? She doesn’t remember anything, she even enjoys having sex with him and feels safe with him. How can it be a revenge when she doesn’t suffer (thankfully) what he is doing to her? This guy was always hot for Flare and all this was a poor excuse, that’s the only reason I found, I’m sorry.<br />
<br />
Even letting all that aside. We knew this guy was made a drug addict by Flare, we understood it very clear, but was it still necessary to decorate that fact with a scene with her making him lick her down there in order to make him take the drug, or the one with the guy sucking his own dick? Not only it is pretty redundant, but it remarks once again what they aim for with this poor thing that doesn’t have the title of hentai. We even have the full package! The lesbian kink wouldn’t be out either. Was it necessary the scene with that crazy girl licking this guy’s tongue so she could feel Flare’s flavor while she literally masturbates upon him? Was it necessary to explicit show how he was raped by the guards and Flare’s partners? The healer is sexually abused IN FLASHBACKS like three times by three different persons in episode three. Again, redundant and with obvious intentions, with the first episode it got clear, now can we go on, or are you still going to persist on unnecessary sex stuff? It is a lot worse than those animes that have an excessive amount of blood in order to attract people. You don’t need to show tits and sex scenes every two minutes to demonstrate a person’s suffer and abuse, and that’s how you can tell this anime was never supposed to be taken as anything more than a dirty hentai with some sort of very bad-made “story”. <br />
<br />
I’m not saying this shouldn’t have sex scenes at all, but when most of the half of an episode is a sex scene, then you can see where this is going. Sex and abuse are meant to be a tool to give context, not to be the entire plot. If the revenge was supposed to be taken seriously, a lot of more aspects could have been explored, since a trauma is not as simple as “they raped me, then I’m going to rape them”. And also, it could have embraced a wider gamma of tortures beyond fisical abuse. If they wanted to represent his ‘deep’ resentment, he could have improved his plans a lot more so he could deploy an actual vengeance with real consequences, but they didn’t have the guts to do that. Because they don’t care about a real revenge nor to represent a compelling damaged person, they just wanted to “take advantage of the bug” and to exploit the sexual side until it reached a disgusting point. Good or not, it accomplished its mision of getting people’s attention.<br />
<br />
Even if we discuss terms of characters, it is still really poor. All we know about Flare is that she was a petty shrew, and that’s it. The same goes for the rest of the rape-team; oh, the only difference I forgot, is that Flare turned into a potato that goes all the time “Keyaruga-samaaa” and that praises him all day.  What do we know about the main character (Keyaruga-samaaa)? Well, he is supposed to be different from other fantasies protagonists since he is more an anti-hero, but he also fails loudly at that. He was abused (in case you didn’t notice) and constantly drugged (in case you didn’t notice. If you didn’t, let me put you another scene of him getting kicked on the floor before he is violated. Again) and he went back in time and got some sort of Geass that he uses in order to achieve his vengeance and to rape Flare. Again. He is pretty buffed like every fantasy main character and is very shallow and disgustingly confident; he sees himself as some sort of god when he is a loser that can’t even do an actual revenge with a logical development. However, can we blame him when 99% of his development is about him being raped in very very very long scenes? Oh, and right now also appeared a furry girl that was used by the anime to give some sort of depth to this guy, because she was a slave and he bought her because “he saw himself reflected on her when he looked her in the eye, that thirst for revenge, and the she will only be satisfied once they kill them”. Yea, nice try. Next season we’ll have the furry girl raping the enslavers as the main premise. I’m looking forward to seeing this, you know. <br />
<br />
Anyway, leaving all that aside, even animation is pretty lousy. Character’s design is nothing new and the visual art is mediocre at best. But hey! We got boobs every episode, so who is going to pay attention to the visual art anyway?<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to take anime that seriously”. There’s a noticeable line between what can be taken seriously and what cannot. If I want to enjoy something without taking it seriously, I go watch a sitcom; If I wanted to watch actual porn, I would go watch it. But making a mix between an abusive hentai and a main character that is supposed to look cool is not something that must function. <br />
<br />
I gave it a try, and even though I don’t usually drop things, I’m in hard times of study, so I’m not spending my few spare hours on something like this. If by episode 12 it ends up being watchable, I may give it a shot again. Nevertheless, right now, I rather have more sleep hours than watch this.

    Redo of Healer is a satire of the generic fantasy and revenge plot. (I&#039;m looking at you Shield Hero). It&#039;s also a &quot;I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s not hentai&quot; series. The show&#039;s story is as terribly beautiful as its premise. A broken man in a broken world is going to get his sword bloody. <br />
<br />
This story is a neat break from generic fantasy stories that anime is known to have. It&#039;s different, and it can be disturbing to some audiences. However, it&#039;s honestly not the worst thing compared to what&#039;s in reach of a several keyboard strokes. For a hentai, I would say it&#039;s actually better.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377462">
        Seeing pixelated genitals has zero appeal, the trick is showing the face and body language, and Redo of Healer has boobs full of that. The author is setting a new standard for eroge, and I am here to bear his flag. God Bless this man and his accursed pen. <br />
<br />
This anime features heavy themes, the most notable as of episode three are rape (from both men and women, the rape also has a place in the world-building since people gain some degree of power from the heroes if they take in their body fluids, it&#039;s not explained in-depth), torture, mindbreak, drug abuse.<br />
<br />
The main theme of the story is revenge. The main character was abused by his old party and tangential secondary/tertiary characters. He&#039;s gone back in time after getting his hands on the philosophers stone, and is preparing his body for revenge (quite literally prepping his body).<br />
<br />
The protagonist is a villain, it&#039;s debatable if he&#039;s an anti-villain, but the tag doesn&#039;t really matter. His motivations are clear cut and focused: taking revenge on the people that destroyed him (psychologically) in his previous life. Each character so far is a piece of shit. Everyone is a terrible human being, save for the Demon King (Queen?) who said something about protecting something, which is ironic. It&#039;s the humans that are the real demons. There&#039;s no deep meaning or anything, the main plot is just a backdrop for the protagonist to have sex with characters. Cool.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a bold story, as in: Redo of Healer is a hentai like how Game of Thrones is a time period piece porno. It&#039;s a good story, the protagonist is easy to emphasize with, he&#039;s extremely proactive, and he&#039;s scary competent. It seems inspired by Rising of the Shield Hero, taking on similar themes to that story but focusing in on the story rather than becoming silly after the introduction of the chicken character. Let&#039;s hope that it doesn&#039;t follow the same path. Shield Hero ended when the princess had justice brought down on her, and left the second half of the story floundering. I believe that the author of Redo of Healer is attempting to write his own version of that type of story archetype. There&#039;s only several characters so far that we know he has to take revenge against, and I can smell more to come. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m interested in what the rest of the show will bring, but its first four episodes have clearly set the rest of the tone of the story perfectly. I would expect more of it and perhaps even an escalation. I&#039;m not expecting anything amazing, it&#039;s obviously a mediocre story, but hey, we&#039;re all in for the ride ;). The outrage this show is causing is giving it a lot more press than it could possibly generate through ads. <br />
<br />
I would also like to note that rape, even as a tool for revenge, is NOT good. Though the majority of topics in your life will show degrees of nuance, rape veers heavily into black (don&#039;t be racist). Like video game violence, rape depicted in stories and porn does not encourage people into performing it. Weak, sociopathic, damaged, and sick human beings will rape other humans and try to make excuses. There are no excuses for rape. The protagonist of this show, if I haven&#039;t already pointed out, is psychologically damaged and is not in anyway being used as a role model by the author. He should be both reviled and a target for sympathy, because the author is attempting to make the viewer feel a mixture of emotions, which is the ultimate goal for any piece of media. The worst feeling to have while experiencing anything is boredom. Redo of Healer is anything but boring. <br />
<br />
This is the best hentai of 2021. 10/10

    As someone who already read the manga.you really should skip or drop this anime NOW if you&#039;re weak minded and can&#039;t handle sexual violence and gore.(minor spoiler ahead)<br />
<br />
Call me edgy, Fetishist, Degenerate, Masochist, sexist or whatever the f*ck you wanted to call me, I&#039;m just gonna say I&#039;m in love with this &quot;anime&quot;, What&#039;s make this &quot;anime&quot; a standout imo is how this anime adds so many flavours to it&#039;s bland plot and genre<br />
<br />
Ok so the plot is your typical revenge story:&quot;bad people do bad things to mc, mc don&#039;t like it, Mc mad, mc want some retribution &quot;but the author decided to add some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377534">
        spice on it<br />
 <br />
Maybe the revenge part is what make this anime so controversial whether if the mc action is justified or not but I&#039;m telling you it&#039;s neither, Right?<br />
<br />
Put yourself on the mc shoes, imagine getting tortured,brainwashed,drugged and Raped EVERYDAY for YEARS what would you do?can you stay sane for YEARS of getting abused and raped? psychologically i think not<br />
<br />
But still revenge is &quot;bad&quot; right? Maybe what&#039;s the right thing to do is to forgive and forget am i right? Well unfortunately not all people are Naruto Uzumaki. People don&#039;t forgive easily and also how they treated the mc it&#039;s like almost impossible for the mc to forgive them<br />
<br />
But seriously though why do people think this anime is glorifying Rape and stuff like that like bruh it&#039;s not like people are going to rape someone after watching this, The anime doesn&#039;t genuinely tell you to rape someone or &quot;rape is good if you&#039;ve been through a lot&quot; the watchers as an (assuming an adult) Actually nope, EVERY HUMAN BEING that lives on this earth should know that rape is never good and should have a mindset that we should never ever rape anyone, you&#039;re not going to rape someone after watching this right?good.<br />
<br />
 As you can see the mc went from innocent normal person to a deranged being who&#039;s hungry for vengeance and doesn&#039;t care about morals when he gets his revenge.this is what happens to someone when you do horrendous stuff to someone,It create a monster. if i happened to learned something from this anime,This anime taught me not to do bad things to anyone and never will be.<br />
<br />
and also where&#039;s the concrete evidence that the author is a misogynistic? I&#039;m not defending his action and actually kinda disgusted by his action. the mc raping the hero princess is out of hatred and thus he wants the princess to suffer the same as he was treated by the heroes and hence, revenge.<br />
<br />
The characters....oh boy. The heroes is actually the bad guys(no sh*t).I despised them. Even the most hated anime villain is more likeable than these &quot;Heroes&quot; with their disgusting lust and two faced personality. They&#039;re not well written at all but the fact that these Heroes is like my most hated anime villain truly shows that they did a fine job with the antagonists<br />
<br />
 I find the mc to be pretty realistic imo. He&#039;s a broken man that doesn&#039;t care about morals once he gets his revenge, his situation is kinda like &quot;either kill or be killed&quot; if he didn&#039;t do anything against the heroes he just gonna live the same miserable life forever so he had to do it. He&#039;s neither a good guy or bad guy, He raped someone, So rape=bad but that doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s fully bad, He doesn&#039;t roam the land raping random people.he helped other people. He even did some good deeds. Even though he&#039;s consumed by vengeance He still have a code<br />
<br />
the OP, Sound and music is pretty mid but damn the animation is quite nice for an &quot;anime&quot; like this if I&#039;m being honest<br />
<br />
<br />
i checked the forum of this anime and apparently there&#039;s a lot of sjw came to this site and made an accounts and they ONLY have seen this show to attack this anime and show their bullshit agenda. I&#039;m willing to bet that if the mc was a woman who wants revenge against her male abuser and rapist. I&#039;m pretty sure the show would&#039;ve been just fine and doesn&#039;t have that much controversy<br />
<br />
Thing is Redo of healer already existed like 2 years ago but doesn&#039;t get as much attention as the anime. This actually shows how mainstream anime is and how the political people always starting to invade and spread their agenda to mainstream stuff.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just gonna say this out of the blue no f*cks given, it&#039;s a f*ckin show, A fictional, An entertainment, it means this ain&#039;t real and you as an adult should know that an entertainment is meant to amuse the audience. you SHOULD know the difference between what&#039;s good and bad in a fiction and what you should or shouldn&#039;t do in reality. Look if you don&#039;t like it i get it i respect you as long as you&#039;re not being a F*CKIN C*NT to someone who enjoyed this show and also don&#039;t watch it and don&#039;t try to cancel this show and ruin people&#039;s day who enjoys this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the the anime is finished it isn&#039;t as dark and fucked up as the manga, they cut  few moments with the torture they somehow tone it down a bit because apparently this show was aired in some tv station in japan so there might be kids watchin the show(Hope not) but i still wouldn&#039;t recommend this show to those who has a weak mentality and sensitive people as the show is about to get worse

    Note: the review contains some spoilers, though not enough to ruin the experience (if the experience could hypothetically be ruined even more than it already is on its own).<br />
<br />
Well, that was certainly a hot mess of a trainwreck. To an extent entertaining to observe how bad it can get, but still a trainwreck nonetheless. This isn’t another Interspecies Reviewers, this isn’t “nooo, you dislike it just because you’re prude and snowflake and cancel culture”. I have literally read guro with better plot than this. Multiple, in fact. And I mean that. This is just plain awful. Not because it’s explicit, but because low effort and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388491">
        low quality work. And no, it’s not “self-aware satire” either. <br />
<br />
Redo of Healer is exactly what it sounds like – a self-insert overpowered wish-fulfilment protagonist with a harem of anime chicks on his dick and edge that could cut through diamonds. Just a bit more hard on the fanservice. Does the level nudity/sex scenes make it unique? No, it’s not the first borderline-h anime. Even in west there are widely popular series that feature nudity, sex scenes and rape – look no further than Game of Thrones. It is simply not something only Redo of Healer did. Does this fanservice make it good? Unless you value your entertainment purely on shock value, no it doesn’t.<br />
<br />
While it is a ballsy move to disregard any shame and common sense and just write the most barebone revenge porn plot and try to sell it, and while it was in a way a marketing success, if you examine it beyond just “titties good, pp hard”, it just keeps getting worse and worse. Which is regrettable, because the concept of “corrupted healing ability” by itself sounds actually interesting. Too bad that approximately zero thoughts were put into this. Nothing is ever explained. The protagonist just has god-like ability that lets him not just heal people, but copy literally everything ever, making any other class obsolete. How did he acquire such powers? Probably through jihad or something idk. It is never explained. What is shown to us is that the MC can now shout “heal” and whatever ability that is currently useful to the plot comes out. Changing faces, that I could still take, it works with body modification – a corrupted healing process. But how is a sword technique “heal”? How can the healer easily overpowers combatants with extensive physical trainings and experience? The concept of corrupted healer is quickly exchanged for the protagonist being able to do literally anything. And not in entertaining way like for example Overlord does it. MC seems to be in trouble? Nope, it was just a ruse, there could never be any actual danger that could pose a thread to the rape jesus. The underuse/abolition of such potentially interesting concept as corrupted healing is criminal. A new concept we get instead is that his cum can make people stronger. Great plot device to shovel in sex scenes.<br />
<br />
Following the usual harem tropes, the female characters have fallen for the protagonist because of extremely specific situations of their first meetings which made them falsely perceive the terrible and uninteresting guy as the greatest human who ever lived and the ideal mate. With the exception of the first one who just got brainwashed, which in this context is the one that makes the most sense. “Thirsty fangirls that are occasionally also used as combatants” is as far as their characters go. They are just materials for the obligatory at least one sex scene per episode.<br />
<br />
Let me talk about the mc’s plan that is the core plotpoint too. It’s dumb. Like, really dumb. The series starts by the protagonist being physically and mentally abused to a breaking point. So, what does he do when given an opportunity to make a change for better? Willingly goes through months of same torture again, just this time for plot reasons it doesn’t destroy him mentally. Sure, he build up immunity towards drugs, but that was hardly the only abuse being applied to it. Revenge is cool and all, but watching a dude get willingly buttfucked in gachi dungeon for a possible opportunity to strike isn’t. Literally think of any other plan please, you have the power of future knowledge on your side.<br />
<br />
Which gets us to the villains of Redo. They are… probably the worst part of this series, really. The antagonists are so unbearable cartoonishly evil. The protagonist might do shady shit, but he has at least some amount of motivation and reason to do it. The antagonists though? They do evil things because they are evil and like to see people suffer. That’s it. The whole lot of them are just extreme sadists. And somehow a kingdom where every royalty, nobles and soldiers seems to be just purely sadistic with disregard for lives and sane decisions hasn’t collapsed on itself yet. One would think that a place where every day any of the citizens could die because of someone’s whim with no repercussions wouldn’t be sustainable. Alas, the plot has to plot.<br />
<br />
Another notably shitty part of the plot is the paradox that is created by adding the demon lord to the harem. Before going back in time, the protagonist meets here as a demon lord. But now in the new timeline, she isn’t a demon lord yet. The problem is, she gets added to the harem by Keyaru saving her life. To quote the man himself &quot;If I weren&#039;t here you would be dead&quot;. Now, how exactly did she became a demon lord on her own if she would already be captured and killed had Keyaru not been there? No explanation at all, it seems like the author hasn’t thought of them in the least. Some minor specific another shitty parts are for example trying to picture a supposedly tragic scene with the mc’s monologue – a monologue that is being said during a threesome, the protagonist, himself being a rapist, being angry at people raping others and ripping off the claw weapon from DxD. <br />
<br />
Now, to give credit when it’s due, the sex scenes themselves aren’t actually bad. They’re not like… great, but they might as well be the best part of the series. While you might get bored by their repetitiveness, that is still better than the feeling of wanting to stab yourself from the cringe overflow that rest of the series causes (this is how I legit felt, no hyperbole). In comparison to average hentai (which is sadly usually low budget) it has a least passable animation So, to not just critize without contributing anything, I do in fact have a solution as to how to make Redo a better anime. And it is not to get rid of the fanservice content, no. On the contrary, it is to get rid of the embarrassing attempt of storytelling and just make this actual hentai with focus on being hentai. Perhaps even sprinkle some kink to the sex scenes too to make it more interesting.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, don’t watch this. And if you decide to do so, intoxicating substances are recommended to ease the mental pain the bad quality could cause. The worst this show has generated is the &quot;fanbase&quot;, people that will ironically (and sometimes unironically) praise Redo as the best show ever just because others find it &quot;offensive&quot; (=think the show is poor taste). It is so tiring. I dare you to disprove me that anyone rating this high has either terrible taste or is trolling (or both).<br />

    I haven’t written many seasonal reviews this year. I slept on Mushoku. I slept on Promised Neverland Season 2. I slept on the glorious Ex-Arm! I will NOT sleep on Redo of Healer! This is one I absolutely had to review as soon as it finished! I gave this a 4 because Redo of Healer is dogshit, but it’s also hands down the most entertaining anime of Winter 2021! I’m dead serious.<br />
<br />
So, exactly what kind of idiocy are we in for? In case you aren’t aware, there is a certain sub-genre within the wide world of isekai. These are the isekai like Shield Hero that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388503">
        were spawned from the massive success of Mushoku Tensei in 2012. Is Sword Art Online too feminist for you? Are you sick of progressive concepts like “consent” ending up in your anime? These are the anime for you! These are pure power fantasies for a market of angry, young, single men. These series absolutely revel in their level of political incorrectness even by Japanese standards. Mushoku is proud to be pro-pedophilia. Shield Hero is proud to be pro-slavery. To be honest, I don’t actually mind this at all. If these series serve as a healthy outlet for frustration and anger, then they are doing a good thing. I may not be the target audience, but not every piece of media is made for everyone. It is perfectly fine for media to sometimes be exclusive. I worked at a Walmart in Tennessee and sold easily about 500 Pureflix movies every month. I am not offended if a movie is made specifically for straight, white, Evangelical Christians and everyone else is going to have a bad time. Sure, it would of course be an issue if that were every movie, but that doesn’t mean we should take the opposite extreme and try erase 100 percent of those movies! Everyone deserves a movie or show that’s made for them. Sometimes we all want to feel comfort, acceptance, and recognition that we don’t have to work for.<br />
<br />
So where does Redo of Healer fit into all this? Honestly…I’m not even sure. Redo of Healer takes this reactionary power fantasy SO far that it becomes an absolute joke. At certain points, I was entirely convinced I was watching a Juvenalian satire. In other words, a show that wanted to make fun of these types of isekai by exaggerating their faults. People genuinely like Naofumi from Shield Hero and Rudeus from Mushoku. Keyaru is completely unlikeable by design. There is no twisted worldview where he’s the good guy. He is a force of chaotic evil who happens to be torturing and killing lawful evil because they harmed him. We can laugh our asses off when he casts a spell on his dick to make himself iron hard and slaps a princess in the face. However, it is impossible to see Keyaru a decent person. Just in case the audience ever gets close to sympathizing with him, it gives him a maniacal laugh and clear-cut villain speech where he proves that he doesn’t care about saving anyone and solely cares about himself. He was fully willing to poison and massacre an entire city simply to gain a sex slave that he can manipulate and commit statutory rape against. When a villain tried to massacre a city to draw him out, he just sat there and watched the massacre happen. Only when a merchant he happened to sort of like was killed did he decide on a whim to save a few survivors. When his favorite restaurant was massacred, he didn’t care about the people. He decided to summon a giant bull and have it rape the killers to death in order to “avenge the food”. Keyaru is best described as 10 percent Lelouche, 20 percent Shield Hero, and 70 percent Kefka from Final Fantasy. He is a broken man that has been driven insane by years of torture, drugs, and rape. Now he exists solely to dole out hilariously over the top punishment on all those who wronged him.<br />
<br />
I’ve argued with several friends on MAL over whether or not Redo was a satire. There are plenty that believe it is actually genuine and the original light novel author is simply that depraved. However, I would argue that Redo of Healer is so ridiculous that it doesn’t even matter if the original author intended it to be serious. The director of the 2006 Wicker Man remake intended it to be a serious and disturbing film that he made as a critique of modern feminism. Nicholas Cage said it best. “When you make a film in which a man dresses up in a bear suit and runs around punching women, you’ve made a comedy.” Redo of Healer can only be classified as a comedy. It’s not really a revenge porn because it isn’t erotic. The sadist who would be satisfied when Keyaru summons 3 ogres to rape and eat an evil lesbian to death will instantly lose his chub when Keyaru busts out a half rack of baby back ribs to munch on and tells her to spread her butthole more. I don’t think it’s clinically possible to get an erection watching this show. The tonal whiplash is simply too intense. Redo of Healer is a comedy just like Top Gun is a gay community cult classic and Dolemite is a comedy and not a serious kung fu film. At a certain point it doesn’t matter if it was entirely intentional or not. Interestingly, this makes Redo of Healer far more inclusive and broadly appealing than Shield Hero or Mushoku. You don’t need to be male to enjoy this show. You don’t have to be straight. You don’t need to be a virgin with rage. All you need to have a ball with Redo of Healer is a dark sense of humor. <br />
<br />
I’m not going to spend much time covering the plot of this show, because the plot honestly doesn’t matter. Redo is about a sad little twerp who gets tortured for years by a team of evil knights who are bent on global conquest. However, this sad sack is actually an evil genius who is formulating a ridiculous revenge scheme. In the first episode, he uses a magic MacGuffin and goes back in time to take advantage of his absurdly OP powers and inflict suffering on all of his enemies. So how is he so powerful? Allow me to introduce you to the moronic magic system in this anime. Healing powers are considered a cursed gift because you must relive all the memories of whoever you heal. That means experiencing all their pain and suffering. This also means that Keyaru can duplicate the spells and abilities of anyone he has healed because he has their memories and knows how to do it. Here’s why that’s so stupid. Keyaru never exercises and isn’t in good shape. He hasn’t conditioned his body at all. Yet he’s able to run at superhuman speed and has superhuman strength simply by having the memories of great athletes. Just because you theoretically know how to run doesn’t mean you’ll be as fast as Usain Bolt! A doctor with poor hand eye coordination can know exactly how to perform a surgery and still won’t be able to do it! He also doesn’t have an abnormally high level of mana, but can cast S tier spells because he knows the basics of how to do it. Keyaru’s power is either intended to be a joke or the author of the LN is a complete moron. Honestly, it could be either from what I’ve seen of the man’s interviews.<br />
<br />
However, Keyaru’s bullshit power has one amazing upside for the viewer. Every single spell in existence is activated by the incantation “HEAL!” This means that every single battle in the show is Keyaru just screaming “HEAL! HEAL! HEAL! HEAL!” ad infinitum. I can’t describe how funny this becomes after a few episodes. All credit goes to Keyaru’s amazing voice actor. If that man ever comes here to my town, he will never have to buy a drink! I will pay his bar tab for life!<br />
<br />
Should you watch Redo of Healer? If you can appreciate dark comedy and want to laugh at something stupid, I absolutely recommend this one! I’m a little sad I can’t bring myself to rate it higher, but it’s also a pretty lousy show on an art and technical level. Definitely bring this title to your next bad movie night. You will be laughing until tears stream down your faces! Shame on Funimation for adapting the virgin Mushoku and not dubbing the Chad Redo of Healer. This should be seen and enjoyed by as many people as possible!<br />

    Shield Hero is having an inferiority complex rn.<br />
<br />
Ok hear me out, I really want to give this an ironic high rating, but it is literally beyond my capability to even do so. Like I want to be super quirky like other reviewers who rate ironically too :( you know like that one preliminary 10/10 Ex-Arm review that poses a threat to comedy, or perchance the voguish undaunted NTR-immune de-Twitter’d armor-plated exemplars who fervently admire this sort of stuffs. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, it’s bad, because it kinda gets boring especially towards the end. But still not that bad.<br />
<br />
After 12 episodes, I barely even know what happens. Comment on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388497">
        my intelligence however you want, but whenever I watch this show and specifically this show, my attention span halves and my brain ceases to intellectually function (though confessedly I just don’t really care about the show). But that didn’t matter. At the end of the day, what matters is that I was slightly amused by the show, sardonic or not, yet also got bored of it pretty quickly. And if there’s anything I ought to be mindful of, it is that unlike Shield Hero, our protagonist healer hero isn’t some midway morally ambiguous caitiff that we’re supposed to like. Ironically, that makes it all the better.<br />
<br />
Let’s get one thing straight first. The discourse on morality, sexual violence and (hate to even type this) ‘thematic depth’ regarding this show is all worthless to me, because for a torture porn to receive such a treatment is unthinkable. It’s like saying “I watch Ruggero Deodato’s movies for the plot”. Now after finishing the show you might be wondering, why are most of the characters over-the-top unhinged subhuman garbage with not a single redeeming quality? The answer is pretty simple, they aren&#039;t supposed to deserve the audience’s remorse. This attributes to the “look at how satisfying the rape revenge brought upon these scums is”, which is essential to how torture porn works. None is meant for you to relate or understand more about rape and revenge, and this is no meaningful writing in my book so I wouldn’t take it seriously either. We, the audience, are conditioned to feel absolute contempt and hatred for the abusers, for it is merely a natural and rational response to despise humans who have shown zero human traits and committed countless heinous acts. So conveniently, the show justifies these unrealistic, comically malicious characters’ suffering, make them suffer for the sake of it to appeal to the instinctual human response. Of course, whether you’re content with the revenge or not is within your power, yet it is hardly deniable that that is the intent of the show. Though talking about nuance, even under a negative light, for something this straightforwardly farcical and exploitative is still mindboggling.<br />
<br />
“But no one deserves to be tortured.”<br />
Ok save that for a serious talk. Because even more conveniently, a once sane, upright protagonist has become a psychopath, reasonably after years of torment. Convenient, isn’t it? For whatever a psychopath does isn’t even within the realm of morality. It matters not if you believe the people who got involved in his revenge didn’t deserve their punishments, because the man is already as far from sanity as humanly possible. Better yet, the show is completely aware of what it’s doing, and acknowledges how evil the MC is. I wouldn’t consider laughing manically after bathing under the blood of the soldiers who just killed the people from your own village is very batman-like; at least from how I see it, the show doesn’t make it seem cool? Sure it works in favor of evil, but it isn’t deceptive nor does it shun its evilness. And not yet, there are still more plot conveniences to come. This man also happens to be a literal god with the kind of power that can technically do anything in the name flimsy alchemy (time travel(??), altering people’s appearance, forceful erection, hentai mind-breaking, etc.). Yes it makes no sense, but again, this is all just an excuse. It excuses his actions, his revenge, his methods, his fucking, his every misdeed simply because it needs to get to the point, the torture porn. There’s nothing deeper about it. In a way, this makes it sort of a hysterically enjoyable watch at times. Watching a comically-treated gloating, egomaniacal psychopath doesn’t give a damn about anything even if he might appear otherwise at first, and how his hedonic methods of revenge is equally as horrible as his victims, is all so hilarious for whatever reasons. I also could not care less about whatever happens to the mc because he’s a purely wicked guy himself. So to sum up the experience, it&#039;s like witnessing an inhuman villain slaughtering other inhuman villains while the whole thing is so absurdly comical, and it’s quite honestly not that bad (at first).<br />
<br />
Inevitably, the formula is destined to be worn out and soon enough, I’m very easily bored (this became an issue after like 4 or 5 episodes I believe). Everything is repetitively patterned, which is to be expected, and that ultimately is its biggest flaw. Sure there might be 1 or 2 funny things happen once in a while to tingle my mingle like the shadow schlong episode. But generally, there isn’t much to look forward to, because the formula doesn’t change. Our protagonist&#039;s path of vengeance won&#039;t see any alternative for as long as this goes, and the outcome is predictably a 2-sides-of-the-coin. Whatever triumph lies ahead or catastrophe befalls the protagonist simply doesn&#039;t compel me, because I have no care for him in the first place. I take none of this seriously so it shouldn&#039;t come as a surprise that for a repetitive formula, nothing can be of interest for a 12-episode length. I guess avoiding the pitfall of Shield Hero – not make the MC someone meant to be liked and make revenge not a complete pain in the ass to sit through by not being serious – can only benefit it so much. For a bluntly exploitative series, enjoyment is everything. Make no mistake, the self-aware irony and hilarity don’t compensate its dreary repetitiveness and a direction that doesn’t pique my interest. By the way, I didn’t watch most of the Shield-Hero-esque trading/investigating/wandering shenanigans in this show but I get the gist of it. Still let’s just say Redo of Healer does it better and thus is a wholly better show because we all know that’s true.<br />
<br />
For the overall production quality, it’s aight like a mid-tier hentai I didn’t pay much attention. The voice acting makes it pretty funny though, so I approve that. So, does it make you a psychopath if you enjoy watching how absurdly psychopathic the protagonist is? No. Does it make you a subhuman garbage that deserves no remorse if you root for the dude? Probably not (except if you actually take it seriously in some twisted way, but morality is shit-fest of a discussion anyway). And does it make you a man of virtue for feeling sick watching a torture porn? Fuck no. Also you have the carte blanche to jerk off to this, yeah I know you’re welcome. Enough said, Shield Hero can go suck Healer Hero’s long shadow schlong. This is objectively the superior revenge tale.

    To start with, lets get the immediate issue out of the way. I don&#039;t mind controversial scenes in anime. I don&#039;t mind rape/assault/traumatic incidents as a device to move the plot along. This is not what is here in Redo of Healer. If the main character had gotten his revenge for how he was treated with one of these methods and then it gave way for the actual story to unfold that would be fine. Instead, every single episode is just some conquest of this repulsive guy, with bits of his old life peppered in to remind you that he&#039;s actually supposed to be the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377540">
        victim. <br />
<br />
I dropped after episode 4, in which a character who did nothing wrong to him and was supposed to also be a victim was deceived and defiled by Keyarga in the name of his revenge. She had nothing to do with it, no reason to be involved, and yet she was still added to his stockpile of sex slaves for no real reason. The rape scenes add nothing to the plot except a power fantasy that should be a red flag for anyone who identifies with them, and since the rape scenes are such a heavy part of the series that means the plot is basically nonexistent.<br />
<br />
You could stand to waste your time watching anime with a better series than this, I certainly wont be giving it any more of my time.

    This anime is vile.<br />
<br />
So general stuff out of the way, the world they are in is essentially just the stock fantasy setting. Absolutely nothing unique going on here. Art is pretty ugly, (the censored version is quite unwatchable, half the screen is blacked out all the time). Music doesn&#039;t stand out much. Some super bad plot details such as our main character, who knows he&#039;s about to get raped for 6 months in the next time loop, goes through with it anyways... because there was no better way to enact his revenge? Sick plan you got there. Oh and he basically has every superpower because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377569">
        one of his healing moves makes him learn the powers of who he heals. I foresee that in future episodes, he&#039;ll be in a bad spot but will randomly pull out a power we didn&#039;t know he had to get him out of it. I guess the voice performances are pretty good, they really get the emotions of the show across.<br />
<br />
Those emotions being: Despair, rage, disgust, sadness, etc... it&#039;s bad vibes only. If you ever feel like stewing in your negative thoughts and emotions, maybe while horny, this is the show for you. Especially while horny. As hentai, it&#039;s got much more going for it than as a show - and the distinction really should be made, my 1/10 is for this thing as an anime. It has some pretty detailed revenge rape scenarios, as well as some femdom, humiliation, cbt, general masochism/sadism. It&#039;s fine if you&#039;re into these things - I love a good mommy dom stomping on me and having me be her slave/pet - however, this is too violent for me.<br />
<br />
On to the show, I hate how everything is just there to justify the revenge plot it has. Scenes and scenes of Keyaru getting raped and tortured TO MAKE SURE that the audience feels bad for him and support the things he does/is going to do later. Everyone who has wronged our main character is a one-dimensional character that is simply just evil for the sake of being evil. They are all massive sadists and psychopaths. The reason for this is again so we can get behind our guy when he eventually tortures and rapes all of them back. See, if any of the bad guys were complex characters, we would feel incredibly conflicted about such scenes of torture to them when they happen. Granted, you probably still felt conflicted anyway when the big 10-minute torture scene happens to Flare in episode 2, because you are a normal human being. If not, you might have ATLEAST been conflicted with the fact that he memory wipes her afterwards and basically make her into a docile sex slave.<br />
<br />
Problem is, none of it really makes any sense. Clearly, this healer is a valuable person to the kingdom, why would anyone allow for him to be battered and abused like this? Why wasn&#039;t it enough just to extort/blackmail the guy? Why is repeated rape and torture + making him a drug addict the thing we do first - oh because the kingdom is evil of course. They got slaves and everything. &quot;It&#039;s gonna be so cool when he burns down this corrupt system, fight the power!&quot; is what some people who enjoy the show might say. To that I say: there are hundreds of shows related to the main character taking down an oppressive and corrupt authority, why is this the one you need to see.<br />
<br />
Does it make sense that Keyaru would be corrupted into this scumbag after everything the kingdom did to him? Sure. Those reasons are insanely stupid, but still valid enough. Is it okay for this guy to be the main character of a show? NOT AT ALL.<br />
<br />
There is a specific crowd of people out there that this show preys on. Delusional and degenerate otaku loners who think the world is against them. They want to project onto Keyaru and feel the catharsis of revenge. They are the group of people that will be like &quot;Hah Flare totally deserved what was coming to her, in fact, it wasn&#039;t enough!&quot; I&#039;ll break it down for them, raping, torturing, and humiliating someone who did those things to you IS NOT OKAY. This isn&#039;t justice. Keyaru isn&#039;t better than his enemies, they are all just scum. If anyone enjoyed what they saw outside the context of hentai, maybe think about it more.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll compare this show to a similar piece of media that I like, Joker. Both are about corrupted individuals that want revenge on the system that corrupted them. This is also a very negative movie but let&#039;s look at why it works. There is actual commentary going on here. Joker is a result of his city&#039;s messed up childcare and healthcare system. You can actually see several points in the movie at which, if things were just a bit different, we wouldn&#039;t have gotten our sad ending. If only he could have afforded his medication and treatment or had been taken out of the abusive home he was in at the start, or just even just if he had avoided the smaller interactions people had with him where they treated him badly for being mentally ill, etc... The villain is accurately pointed to be the elite class who would be the people getting in the way of healthcare and childcare reform. We see all these pieces come together and we think &quot;this is tragic because all these things could actually happen to someone in real life, and sometimes already has happened to some people.&quot; Yadda yadda we live in a society and all that.<br />
<br />
So in Redo of Healer, Keyaru is the result of... a bunch of psychopaths wanting to rape and torture a guy for a year straight? You can&#039;t apply this show to the real world because no person in it, or the world itself, is written complexly enough. So all we are left with is a show that is seeped in negativity, with nothing to take away from it.<br />
<br />
TLDR; This is a negative show for negative people with 0 ideas or lessons to takeaway*<br />
<br />
*As of 4 episodes in, who knows, maybe it&#039;ll get into the complexities of slavery in their world, or maybe Keyaru sees the error of his ways and realizes revenge is bad, anything to salvage this wreck.

    I&#039;m sure a lot of people stumble over Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi when they read through the overall discourse on various social media platforms. Violence on a new level is what apparently makes this anime stand out so much from others of its kind and yet it is rarely mentioned that it is far from being the first anime to do so - I remember the first episode of Mahou Shoujo Site turning many viewers down due to the extreme violence that Aya was subjected to by her brother.<br />
<br />
If we look at how Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi (aka. Redo of Healer) portrays its characters we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377613">
        can clearly see that not a single part of this anime was ever thought through. Keyaru goes through a lot of pain in his first life, being tortured, drugged and raped by Flare and her companions. His life is skimmed through in the span of about a minute. Every other character is evil because the plot wants it that way. None of the characters has any sort of human trait but instead they are all designed to be an unlikable piece of trash. Maybe I&#039;d feel something if the characters had any sort of personality to them but apparently they don&#039;t because that would require 2 braincells to write an actual good story.<br />
<br />
At this point, this anime is just a glorified Hentai. There is no &quot;story&quot;, no world to explore, all characters are utter garbage and the only redeeming quality of the entire anime is a nice character design and even that is highly subjective. Watching it bears no relative merit whatsoever past seeing fetishized sex (either consensual or not - mostly not). You might as well turn to your favorite hentai streaming website and looking through the Fantasy genre because torture, mind break, rape and similar things are quite popular in Hentai. It&#039;s much better than staring at a wall for 30 seconds before seeing a pitch black screen because 50% of the episode is censored.<br />
<br />
It is laughable that this anime gets any sort of positive attention. I like new takes on the Dark Fantasy genre and pushing the boundaries of what&#039;s acceptable but if so it should be done within reason. Redo of Healer adds nothing to the genre and portrays itself as a Hentai. It&#039;s a genuinely bad anime. I don&#039;t see how anyone can watch this and get any sort of entertainment from it because clearly the only reason to watch it is if you want to see Keyaru toy with various girls. And that being the only reason, why would you watch an anime that is airing on TV, meaning that the good stuff is gonna be censored anyways? I don&#039;t get it.<br />
<br />
Redo of Healer is bad and does not even fulfill basic quality standards. I don&#039;t usually rate an Anime with a 1 but after watching 4 episodes I&#039;m sure that this is the worst TV anime I have ever seen, actually beating Mahou Shoujo Site which I never thought was possible.<br />

    I&#039;d like to start this review by saying: People are seemingly bombarding the show with bad ratings because they are offended by it, so you should not base on it whether you want to watch it or not. If you think it sounds interesting then you are probably going to find it worth a watch. If you don&#039;t like dark stuff, get easily offended or are easily disturbed don&#039;t even bother as this is the exact opposite of rainbows and happiness. It&#039;s a very unique and dark story that got a ton of people offended within the first two episodes. This show is seemingly too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377533">
        much for the heroes of the internet, the holy knights of the keyboard. People nowadays just cannot seem to stay away from the stuff they don&#039;t like, they have to try and fight in hopes of cancelling it as the mighty war heroes they are!<br />
<br />
--- This only contains very minor spoilers and everything included is shown within the first episode --<br />
The story tells about a man called Keyaru who is the healing hero. His healing abilities are very op like but they come with a great cause, it causes him a great amount of pain. Keyaru is imprisoned, raped, tortured and drugged becoming addicted to this drug and losing his sense of self. He is continuously abused and forced to heal others, feeling the pain his healing causes. In the end, all these factors drive him crazy, making him strive for vengeance. He gains immunity to the drug and gets his senses back. He is later taken with a party to defeat the Demon King. Keyaru defeats the Demon King with ease and obtains the Philosopher&#039;s Stone. He reverses time back by four years and starts seeking his revenge.<br />
<br />
The story follows an OP character. He is able to gain all of the skills and experience of the healed. With this, he can also transform people&#039;s looks including gender, absorb and copy levels of a person and modify things the way he wants in general. In other words, he can do pretty much anything.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this anime to everyone who is not easily disturbed and wants a dark and refreshing take on storytelling. The animations are very solid and the characters have a lot behind them. Also, a piece of advice: Don&#039;t watch it censored, assuming you don&#039;t want to look at the walls and floor for 5 minutes an episode.

    Honestly, I am more curious of the implications of his healing magic than I am of his revenge, because, well, his revenge is stupidly paced. His healing does its job by undoing what has been done. It reverts the body back in time from before the body sustained injuries. You ever watched the Tangled movie? It works like that, sort of. But in the course of the healing, the injuries and mental anguish suffered at the point of injury and in the aftermath of sustaining it is channelled into the healer, causing him to suffer mentally as well as feel “physical” pain without any physical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377530">
        injuries happening to him. Already the author could have made a story around that premise. He didn’t. The power just ended up becoming whatever thing the author wanted to do to setup his story. If you are here for an in-depth exploration of that, you are likely not to get one. Find another show.<br />
<br />
So, with regards to pacing (segue, because, see, my pacing and transition was also messed up), at the very least, the Episode 2 revenge should have been at Episode 4. This leaves us enough time for build up and allows his revenge plan to progress as a thriller, not a sloppy shitty voice over done in what, less than 10 minutes of Episode 2. Imagine if they at least had dedicated a full episode to his escape, how he outwits the guards, navigated the castle, etc, all while the spectre of discovery and punishment hangs over him, ready to punish a mistake. But it’s a voice over. His final escape of the castle is also a voiceover; not one scene is dedicated to the escape. So let’s just go to his initial revenge as this anime was wont to go; and just as a disclaimer, I watched the uncensored version just to not be accused of missing something that might shed new light on how I view this show. <br />
<br />
How is it framed? Outside of maybe the music, it is not framed as horrifying or tragic that this kid has been abused to the point where he can see no recourse but to experience the abuse again on the way to getting revenge on her, instead of just stabbing her dead the first chance he gets. The way colors are used to highlight her naked body and the flagrant shot of her ass with careful contouring and angle while she was begging leads me to believe this is meant to titillate; not helping with that impression are the boob shots and cheesy hentai lines being spouted while she is being violated. This is at odds with how we are supposed to feel at this situation, pitying the MC for the mostly uncontrollable circumstances that led to this point of his life. And also questioning the decisions I have made during the day I wrote this draft that led me to analyzing what is supposedly a torture scene, pausing every bit in between the scenes to write my thoughts down. After that, I went 50/50 on the music because it could be that that piece meant to highlight her desperation -not his descent into darkness- and then frame that desperation as titillating.<br />
<br />
So, this has the pacing of a hentai, the framing of a hentai, and if they had wanted to, they could have just made this straight up a hentai. If you want a revenge story, I’m not really sure this will hold up. It rushes towards payoffs, not realizing that build ups are equally important. That is the same way it handles its harem: rushing towards payoff. And yes, this is going to be a harem. The context points towards that outcome. Would it leave its audience feeling like the show pulled the old switcharoo trap of baiting them with edge and then pulling a harem and staying a harem away from the edge where they are now trapped in watching a harem show waiting for the edge to show up again? Let’s find out. I for one think he could use some pleasant stroll through the countryside after what happened to him but that was before Episode 2 happened and the also before the second girl joined him. Because this harem he is building is messed up as well and I would love to talk about it but I already spoiled something that happened in Episode 2. I will not do you the disservice of spoiling further. This prelim is just for the people on the fence about this show, to give them an impression of what they can expect.

    At the risk of stating the obvious, it&#039;s clear that no one over at TNK put a lot of effort into this anime. But considering the fact that their top anime is Highschool DxD one shouldn&#039;t be all too surprised by this fact. <br />
<br />
The largest problem with this anime is the story and the characters. They just aren&#039;t very fleshed out. One basic component of making a character is making them have reasons for doing things. This is extremely obvious. Why does the princess hate the MC enough to spend extreme amounts of effort abusing him over several years? Beats me. The anime never really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377620">
        goes in and explains these basic things about it&#039;s characters, and as a result investment in them becomes difficult. From a more meta perspective the reason is clear, of course. Because the writers need some sort of moral justification for the upcoming r*pe/torture scenes. But that&#039;s an out-of-universe explanation. There isn&#039;t really any in-universe explanation and that&#039;s a problem. It gives the viewer the feeling that the story was just an after-thought and that the sex-scenes is everything the creators cared about. Those priorities don&#039;t make for good anime, sure, they make for good hentai, but this anime clearly wants to at least pose as something more than fap-material.<br />
<br />
Characters don&#039;t need to be deep, not all entertainment needs to be deep, but it should at least be entertaining. If i asked you to describe the MC of &quot;kaiyari,&quot; what would you say? He&#039;s mean, he&#039;s angry, holds a grudge? He doesn&#039;t really have any notable traits that make for an entertaining viewing experince. He&#039;s just a blank slate with anger issues. What was his early life like before he became property of the princess? Did he have values, dreams goals? What were they? Does he have any funny or interesting quirks? If you saked me these questions about the MC of other fantasy-shows, even less &quot;deep&quot; ones like KonoSuba i could answer these questions. With Keyaru i can answer none. It seems like the protagonist was nothing more then an after-thought. This is bad, an anime is nothing wihtout a strong lead. <br />
<br />
The anime also fails at basic world-building. How does magic work, why is the MC&#039;s magic so strong? What cheat has he discovered that allows him to do literally anything? No answers. There&#039;s a time-skip and after that the MC&#039;s powers are completely broken, what are the mechanics behind that? Even in some of the most generic shows such as &quot;The Irregular at Magic High School,&quot; how magic functions is actually explained. It&#039;s not an after-thought and is as such way more engaging. This anime fails completely in this area as well. It is clear that everything except for the sex-scenes are a complete after-thought in this anime. I expect that kind of behaviour in hentai or pornos, not in a non-hentai anime from a major studio. <br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
This anime fails in basic character- and world-building, and as such i just can&#039;t take it seriously or be invested. As a result i don&#039;t see this show as &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;too tough for normies&quot; a dark show makes your stomach turn, it makes you feel bad. This show is too lazily written to do any of that for me. I guess it could work as fap-material for some people but it is certainly not a good show. Unless you&#039;re watching it with your d*ck in your hand you won&#039;t get any value at all out of it. You won&#039;t see me walking around pretending that this show is good or has anything going for it just so that i can &quot;piss off the SJW&#039;s&quot;. I&#039;m not that infantile.

    As a big fan of the manga and the art style of Shiokonbu, I had high expectation from this anime adaptation and it delivered.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve read several manga with similar plot and I believe Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi is among the best of this &quot;revenge fantasy&quot; sub-genre. The art and music are awesome. The girl characters are attractive. The protagonist is likable. Watching it makes me want more anime like this one.<br />
<br />
The first episode was kind of a rush and didn&#039;t explain much as to why the protagonist holds a big grudge on the other characters. People who didn&#039;t read the light novel and/or manga before

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377542">
        would probably have some problem with this plot. The second episode would show more of the story and how terrible he went through.

    First things first this is my first review.<br />
But I already can tell you this: If you&#039;re a soft ahh person, than this is not for you.<br />
I can recommend Tate No Yuusha then.. maybe...<br />
<br />
The MC is heavily abused and mistreated by his whole enviroment. He&#039;s literally living in hell.<br />
But somehow he manage to heal the world so the time gets set back to a point he didn&#039;t experienced all the pain yet. So he decided to get back to all the people in the most painful way possible.<br />
<br />
From what I&#039;ve seen yet the animation style is A+<br />
The synchronisation of the voices is done perfectly as well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377661">
        as the storytelling.<br />
Music and etc. is good too. Everything is definetely very enjoyable. At least for me it was.<br />
<br />
Finally we get an MC which is not a disappointment and gets his revenge in the same way back.<br />
<br />
I really don&#039;t know if this for you but if you can handle graphic stuff this is for you.<br />

(WHEW. Now that episode 4 is out, I can finally rewrite my review without it getting removed.)<br />
<br />
<br />
A basic &quot;dark-fantasy narrative&quot; reduction stock. A couple dashes of &quot;bad writer&#039;s power fantasy.&quot; Add in around 50 mL of &quot;mc-with-machiavellian-revenge-plans.&quot; Top it off with 2 tablespoons&#039; worth of sex scenes to make it all enjoyable. Behold! You have concocted Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi!<br />
<br />
This show just comes off as a the some kind of suppressed power-trip gone wild. It simply lacks substance. But hey, it&#039;s got sex, and the mc dominates, so.....sins forgiven? I&#039;m not going to be dishonest and tell you that I didn&#039;t enjoy watching this crap.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377555">
        I was thoroughly entertained. This show plastered a big smile across my face. I mean, c&#039;mon! The story revolves around a man who creates himself a harem and uses said harem to pursue ultimate vengeance! Kinda comedic if you say it out loud? Yes. Unenjoyable? NOPE.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for something with compelling writing and well constructed characters, you&#039;re better off watching something else. If you want to see a show that gives off the same aesthetic vibes as Goblin Slayer, whip off your pants right now and git ready to GET OFF TO THIS SHOW. Just kidding. Keep your pants on. Case in point, this show is enjoyable, and I will continue to watch it. However, it would be brutally dishonest to rate this shit anything above a 5. <br />

    There is a reason why many non anime watchers generalize anime with lolis, boobs, and furries. I say that while many shows pull this off poorly, this show doesn&#039;t. Words cannot describe just how amazing this show is. It has everything one would ask for in an anime but with the best and unique execution out there. It has everything such as: a wolf girl, action, drama, a badass revenge plot, a main character that pulls off the most creative ways of getting back at his enemies, a harem, men, women, a lot of sex, love drug potions, great fighting animations, and a kickass opening

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388522">
        and ending. Did I also mention a lot of sex?<br />
<br />
Anyone who says this show is bad obviously cannot look at the greater picture of what the author was trying to envision. She (yes, it&#039;s a female who made this) was creating a new genre of anime. You already seen video game developer, Hideo Kojima create a new genre for video games with his latest video game, Death Stranding. He calls it the first strand type game. I say the author also did the same thing here. She created the first strand type anime where the main character connects with everyone who fell under the same abuse as him and he is trying to connect them together with him, to be whole as one, literally. He shares the same suffering, emotions, and pain as them. He even goes as far as to help them in revenge just as much as the same goal the main character has for his enemies too. You thought Ride to Hell: Retribution offered the best type of revenge plot? Hell no. This show is where it is at.<br />
<br />
Now while some may say that this show may go too far with its graphic scenes and portrayal of some characters, I refute that this show takes on a more satire approach on what it is going for. So literally, this is a show that is not meant to be taken seriously right from the get-go. Also, the characters in this show, for the most part, deserve the punishment they get because of all the other cynical things that they have done in the past. Once you remember that, you will forget all the pity you had for the villains in this show. By the end, you are already rooting for the main character and his harem team to deliver the proper justice that they wanted to do for so long. That is why this show is a masterpiece and no one can say so otherwise that any other anime is better than this. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.<br />
<br />
10/10 would watch again.

    I am not a social justice warrior. But I don’t condone revenge porn either. Although I would like to just write off every detail of this anime as misogynistic and rapey, I’m going to be as objective as possible in this review. So even if you don’t agree with me, please don’t just throw me off as a triggered reviewer. The reason I am asking for this is because Redo of Healer is a very likely candidate for most controversial anime of the year, if not ever. <br />
<br />
Now that I have clarified the purpose of this review, let me ask: What is the appeal of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388516">
        this anime? Why do people have an interest in it? Well, if you just take a look at the top 2 recommended anime, you’ll notice that it’s Shield Hero and Goblin Slayer. Shield Hero is a revenge story released in 2019 with a score still of at least 8.0 at the time of this review being submitted. It’s Kinema Citrus’ most popular anime. Shield Hero garnered huge numbers money-wise and received both heavy criticism and praise on both sides of the community. On the other hand, Goblin Slayer has an infamous 1st episode that recieved even worse criticism and depicts graphic rape scenes. Now, you may ask, is this the love child of Shield Hero and Goblin Slayer? Well, I actually haven’t watched Goblin Slayer, but I can definitely confirm Redo of Healer is an even more vengeful, darker series than Shield Hero. The reason I am mentioning these two series is because most people in the anime community know how infamous they are. I don’t mean Shield Hero and Goblin Slayer are popular like Attack on Titan or My Hero Academia, I’m saying these shows being recommended for Redo of Healer fans are known for extremely polarizing content. And as you can tell by my score of Redo of Healer, I don’t think it’s good. Far from it. <br />
<br />
Also, what is the main aspect that people are watching for? Is it for the mediocre at best animation? The newbie voice acting and generic soundtrack? The 1-D characters and ‘repetitive’, one-trick pony story? In all honesty, the appeal of this type of anime is clear because it is on the hentaihaven site. It’s simply a hentai with a ‘plot’. In my opinion, denying that would be a denial of a fact.<br />
<br />
The 1st episode starts out with the backstory of our MC, who I will not name because he does not need one. After being abused and raped by practically every soldier, in the Jioral Kingdom, he sets his eyes on vengeance against all those who wronged him. When given the convenient opportunity to use his ‘healing powers’ to 1v1 a demon overlord that incapacitated the Jioral Kingdom’s 3 best fighters, he travels back in time to before he became a ‘healer’. Right at this point, it should be fairly obvious that both the action scenes are as fluid as a rock and the story revolves around a Gary Stu that’s not likeable. So visually or characterization-wise, there is zero appeal. What does the MC do after turning back the time? He eats poisonous mushrooms and essentially practices the same torture that was done by his torturers on himself so he can attain drug immunity. By the end of the 1st episode, there is ‘justification’ for the MC to continue plotting against the world for his grand scheme because one of the characters decides to say out loud that she wants to force the MC to use his healing powers by any means necessary. In flashbacks and timelapses of the following episodes, he then relives the cycle of being abused by his captors again before actually deciding to take his revenge. The audience sees minutes-long graphic depictions of his abuse over and over again by Princess Flare, male soldiers, and two LGBTQ+ characters, Blade and Bullet.<br />
<br />
The way this anime portrays the two LQBTQ characters is problematic. If their sexual identity wasn’t their defining trait, it might’ve been less noticeable, but their personalities are the pinnacle of lesbian and gay stereotypes. Blade, appearing to hate the MC for being a male and for ‘spreading his filth’ on to Princess Flare, violently kicks him around while also having oral sex with him so she can ‘taste’ Princess Flare. The stereotypes that Blade falls into are ‘Lesbians are masculine people’ and ‘Lesbians hate every single man’. Blade is the only LGBTQ+ woman in this show and it appears to remain that way. The writer for Redo of Healer is using already negative stereotypes which perpetuates false misinformation about the pride community. Meanwhile, Bullet is a gay man who treats the MC like a child, makes flirtatious remarks about him, and also violently slapping him. All the while, Blade speaks about love as he also rapes the MC. Blade falls into the negative stereotypes that ‘all gay men are feminine and exuberant people’, ‘gay people are pedos or sexual predators’, and ‘LGBTQ+ people try to convert others into being LGBTQ+”. Although Blade is not the only gay man, every soldier in the Jioral Kingdom is a sexual predator who lines up to rape the MC. The writer blatantly uses the most homophobic perceptions of an already marginalized community to create hatred of these characters. There is no other way to say it. This is objectively bad.<br />
<br />
Other than these unnecessarily lengthy graphic scenes, every following episode is just sex with a plot. It’s not even about revenge Character-wise, all the women are initially ‘mean, cold-hearted people’ who eventually fall in love with the MC after he magically saves them or ‘shows them the truth’. They then have sex with the MC multiple times and lose all of their initial characteristics while the main character continuously acts as a vengeful being. All other males are portrayed just as vile as the main character. Everyone has no other personality traits. Additionally, he is able to continuously add to his harem because his ‘healing’ powers allow him to permanently copy everyone’s ability and use it for himself. There’s nothing he can’t do. Change the appearance of his face? Check. Massacre an entire army? Check. Brainwash girls into not having any memories of him? Check again. If you can name it, he can probably do it, most likely without even copying someone’s abilities himself since the writer just conveniently hands it to him. A question I asked myself as I finished every episode is, “What is this guy’s purpose?” In the first episode, he had multiple opportunities to just kill off everyone in a bloody massacre but he decided to go back in time before anyone had abused him. When he relived the hell of rape and torture again, I asked “Why?” He had opportunities to gain his powers without resorting to this hell. He could’ve escaped, killed everyone immediately using his overpowered abilities, or developed the story like a normal power fantasy. Particularly with his revenge on Flare, we see an entire episode of the MC violently hurting her before forcing her to have sex with him. He then brainwashes her, escapes with her and tells Flare that she is his lover. Following this, Flare just magically falls in love with him and they have ‘consensual’ sex together for the remaining episodes. Maybe I just don’t know how revenge works, but isn&#039;t awareness of the MC’s vengeance part of the revenge? Is taking this brainwashed girl along actually relevant to his revenge or is it just an excuse to give this despicable MC a harem? Every other girl in his harem has never wronged him and he doesn’t need to do anything, but they become part of his posse of people who he has sex with. That still doesn’t really answer my question of “What is this guy’s purpose?” It appears to me at least that the MC is ‘supposed’ to be an antihero that the audience is supposed to cheer for, but I cannot fathom why. It’s 2021. March is Women’s History Month and we have this kind of show that finishes airing today? Is this some kind of sick joke? Are we supposed to cheer when he rapes and brainwashes women into thinking he’s some kind of dark knight in shining armor? My answer is no. I cannot find anything objectively positive about Redo of Healer at all and I don’t see why anyone should.<br />
<br />
Some will consider the MC’s rape as ‘justice’ while others will consider it as simply ‘fucked up’. These are both opinions that exist in the anime community, whether anyone likes it or not. In my opinion, it’s a rapey revenge show with a sex-of-the-week plot and zero themes. There are significantly better revenge stories out there that actually have redeeming qualities. I know some people have a kink for the rapey parts and other people will find it infuriating and insulting. Although I find myself in the latter camp, I have broken down the core aspects of this hentai/‘story’. There’s a censored and uncensored version. When you watch this kind of show, it’s probably not for the ‘story’ but for the sex scenes. Some fans will not find this objective cause of the rating, but to be honest, fans of any show will defend whatever they love these days. I just rated this how I would any other anime, using my opinion of an objective score. I’m prepared to block people who send hate comments to me because of my review. You might ask why I didn’t go full subjective and just bash this show for everything possible. Other people are already doing that. I’m just providing a concurring opinion without adding to the echo chamber. Hope that helps. Overall Rating 0/10.

    Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi or Redo of Healer changed my life. Redo of Healer is has amazing animation. Redo of Healer has an amazing story. Redo of of Healer has an amazing sound track along with a great opening and ending. The characters are amazing as well especially Keyaru/Keyaruga/chad/legend/god. My enjoyment? MAN THAT WAS AWESOME. When I&#039;m about to watch Redo of Healer, I make sure the door is locked, close the blinds, turn off my phone, make sure there is no interruptions btw I watch the uncensored version like anyone should. I get really really pumped with the opening starts playing then episode starts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392643">
        and man that I cry sometimes of how amazing this show is. I love when Keyaru gets revenge as I&#039;m a big fan of revenge driven plots. However calling this revenge might be an understatement because this MAN GETS MORE THAN REVENGE, this man re shaping the fucked up world that fuck him up to begin with. What does Keyaru do? THIS MAN CUMS, HE CUMS AND KILLS. Uses an OP fucking power simply called Heal to heal the corrupted world he lives in.<br />
<br />
*Justification on why Keyaruga-sama&#039;s action are right and not wrong.*<br />
<br />
I think his methods are justified. After all hes been treated liked shit, he himself has been raped by multiple men and women, drugged and seduced by his party members. He could do nothing as he was weak. His corrupted mind could have been the main factor to constructing his revenge. He saw an opportunity to make a change and took it, if he had not then he mostly liked would have continued be treated horribly and raped till death. His revenge could actually help the corrupted world/kingdom, Keyaru his not the only one doing horrible things to others, example being the knights invading Setsunas home with intentions to in slave her kind. No dislikes with Keyaru as character. Revenge stories are my favorite so this is why I like Keyaru as a character. Also at the end of the day my man fucks his harem of cute waifu girls absolute CHAD.<br />
<br />
I will now end this review with saying that this anime is amazing however I of course understand why someone would absolutely think this anime is lower than shit. I will look forward to reading it&#039;s light novel or manga. Overall this is an easy 10/10 and this review is pretty shit I know becauses it written by me, danksonic a person who has either GOD taste in anime or TRASH taste in anime. Thank you for reading and also Setsuna is best girl.<br />

    Revenge... For many, something good, necessary, a measure that has to be taken, with the objective of improving their reputation and dignity after being betrayed, scolded, hurt. For others, something that should not consume a person&#039;s essence, nonsense, since when he takes revenge on someone, the victim becomes as repulsive as the aggressor. Well, 12 episodes were more than enough to decide what Keyaru has become: a boy who, at the beginning, wants to take revenge for maintaining a minimum of dignity, but who has absorbed a possession and an excessive addiction to rotten, horrible and sick.<br />
<br />
Honestly, talking about Kaifuku will be difficult, since there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388499">
        is not much to discuss. We&#039;ll start with the protagonist, Keyaru. He is a young man, who has been blessed with an incalculable power throughout the universe of history: the ability to heal immense and even fatal damage from other heroes and warriors in the Kingdom of Jioral. However, Keyaru is constantly abused by the inhabitants who struggle to defend the place. The main group, Bullet, Blade and Flare, is the one that most abuses the protagonist, from cursing to sexual acts. &quot;Keyaru is a young man who must not suffer, he has done nothing... He does not deserve this.&quot; Well, if Kaifuku was a show that, due to its proposal, was suited to the minimum qualities of positively developing the protagonist, I could accept this argument. However, everything, absolutely EVERYTHING is degraded as the episodes pass. Well, Keyaru finally gets a power that makes him go back to the past (parallel world? Possibly, but Kaifuku doesn&#039;t care about that) and can rebuild his life, taking revenge on his molesters.<br />
<br />
And how to take revenge on horrendous people, with no humanity at heart? The answer is simple for Keyaru, ladies and gentlemen, treating him the same way he was abused. Here we already have a problem, perhaps the biggest problem for the entire show. The anime does not hide that the protagonist is sick and further intensifies it in order to treat what he does as something normal. Okay, it would be understandable if these acts were only used against those who molested him a second time, in this &quot;second world&quot;, before Keyaru gained resistance to one of the drugs offered by our sweet and beloved Princesses Flare. But no, as much as Keyaru has this objective of only punishing those who deserve it, he is completely lost. After doing what he did to Flare, in addition to faking her death, Keyaru isolates himself in a suburban city, erasing Flare&#039;s memories, in addition to changing her name.<br />
<br />
In addition to being completely edgy, Keyaru has a multitude of peculiarities that defy his own disturbing mentality. The protagonist ironically conflicts with the reasons why he is doing the evil actions. At the same time that he repudiates the violence of the Jioral warriors, who arrest the people of the village of Keyaru, he is saddened, as an appealing way of possessing some boast and decency. That&#039;s right! One action of a kingdom is enough, according to the anime, to soften, justify and trivialize the actions of our eternal protagonist. It is not as if this is not something socially &quot;accepted&quot;. In fact, ancient peoples already used some legislation to punish and nullify crimes. The Hammurabi Code and the &quot;Eye for an eye&quot; law are two of the many instruments that founded the infinite rules of morals and ethics in our world. However, it is poorly used in Kaifuku. In these instruments of inspection of the order of society, the intervener is the leader of the kingdom or the city itself. However, Keyaru takes responsibility for himself, as a legitimate defense and being solely responsible for this &quot;adequacy of society&quot;. Keyaru himself assumes himself as a good character, a reference, someone to follow, as if he were a God. This kind of mentality degrades not only him, but his actions. It is understandable to see him attempting his redemption in some way, but does it need to be the same as the warriors did? He reset the world, was chosen again to be a hero in Jioral, defied his own sanity and promoted his &quot;victory&quot;. The show also tries to alternate the protagonist&#039;s thoughts and ideals, when the people of his native village are taken to the kingdom as a way of attracting Keyaru. Furthermore, the woman who took care of Keyaru, being like a mother to him, is (OF COURSE) raped.<br />
<br />
If Kaifuku was decent, even a change of face would be easily accepted, but no... not in Kaifuku. What Keyaru does doesn’t change Flare’s look practically, and it already puts the entire anime in a state of meaningless garbage. How can Keyaru just change his name to &quot;Keyaruga&quot;, Flare become &quot;Freia&quot; and say &quot;It&#039;s okay, no one will notice.&quot;? Any idiot would easily realize that he had changed nothing, literally nothing, of the two. TNK Studio is not to blame, it comes from the manga, when he gave more accurate illustrations about the characters. It is not possible that nobody warned Souken Haga, the manga&#039;s illustrator, to change the look more radically. And that is one of the minimum problems. Kaifuku doesn&#039;t stop there...<br />
<br />
What to talk about the development of the group that Keyaru builds over time? Well, Setsuna, Crylet and Eve Reese are the other girls in this disgusting harem. Each with its goals, of course, has no way for Keyaru to achieve its ambitions without them. Setsuna is an ice wolf, who wants to annihilate those who almost wiped out her race people; Crylet is a warrior from the Kingdom of Jioral who surrenders to Keyaru having recovered his arm after an incident, even at the beginning of the anime: Eve Reese is a demon who aims to become her People&#039;s Leader. All of them, in some way, have their reasons for relating to Keyaru, but the show leaves that aside. The anime wants to show sex... And more sex... And more sex... Yes, Kaifuku only knows how to identify this as a reason to continue his productions. In addition to having completely horrible flashbacks of Keyaru being raped and taking revenge on some characters, the group he finds himself in does not stop surrendering to the &quot;best anime protagonist&quot;. The reason? Well, in most cases it is a daily routine to increase the maximum level ability in the fantasy world. Yes, they completely missed even that. And the power of Keyaru? Healer? Really? He has an ex-machina power, which does literally everything he wants??? Anything that could be a problem for Keyaru&#039;s goals is rendered useless from the moment he has the capacity to do literally EVERYTHING. The fanciful elements are already appealing when Keyaru speaks &quot;Heal&quot; constantly, even more so when the hero&#039;s &quot;liquid&quot; is something sacred in this world, a holy chalice. Urgh !! This is really despicable to think about.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if Kaifuku was a Hentai? Would it be a good anime for that genre?&quot; ~ Being honest, I would already consider Kaifuku a Hentai, because in addition to designing content with explicit and excessive sex scenes, the show has a very common proposal in anime for adults. In many cases, hentais address topics such as rape, mind break, blackmail, threats, ahegao and other techniques of intensity, with the aim of promoting libidinous action to those who assist. Kaifuku has all these techniques mentioned, but it is very difficult to imagine that the theme of the show helps to even be a support for excitement, since it is mainly an anime that assumed to be a story of redemption for a character who suffered a lot. The show sells that idea, we buy it. Some do not like it and give up to continue... Others continue and want to see the level that the show can reach. Unfortunately, the same show that was wrong to be an anime with a good story, was wrong to have ecchi, in addition to making mistakes even if it was, by definition, a hentai. It is really sad, after just over a year, to see another show decaying the minimum quality that some ecchis have already brought. Anyone who remembers Ishuzoku Reviewers knows that his idea is something that makes it easier for the show to have a fun and innovative story. Kaifuku tried to be innovative and, at the same time, wanted to be more than he could. The manga is no different. I remember when I started reading Kaifuku and I remember that I already thought everything the chapters proposed was okay. But today, two years after reading this manga, I seriously rethink the reasons that made me accept such a chaotic evolution of history. The only thing I can positively extract from the entire franchise is just the fact that it was the first manga I read. Of course, I was unaware of how bad it was. I was just a 15/16 year old boy who looked at this and thought it was &quot;cool&quot;. Today I just think it&#039;s rubbish. A quality that exists only in the synopsis.<br />
<br />
And what about your huge production? Well, she is objectively bad. Kaifuku presents an acceptable animation, but absolutely generic (remember, the biggest culprit of this is the manga&#039;s illustrator), in addition to a very bad scene composition. The show&#039;s director should now rethink having chosen Kaifuku to do his job now. Of course, I think the show must have been turned down countless times and ended up in one of the worst studios today. TNK was never a great promoter of good and decent works (DxD and School Days are enough to exemplify this), now it&#039;s Kaifuku. The magnum opus of destruction, chaos misunderstood. A masterpiece from 2021? Maybe... Maybe even Ex-Arm doesn&#039;t get over this character deconstruction. Maybe we&#039;re crazy...<br />
<br />
No more...<br />
<br />
This anime does not know how to take advantage of the revenge concepts and is not limited to just narrating... Kaifuku wants to be a hentai in disguise. Well, he did it, now the show has two versions, censored and adult. And what do we have? A horrible adaptation of a manga that was already horrible, of a light novel that is possibly not good either... This is the disaster of 2021 ladies and gentlemen. And I really hope that they have some neurons to understand that, no matter how it gets transmitted. Even though Keyaru has his reasons (which is already stupid, as he might as well do other acts instead of rape rape rape), the show does not hide the hell it is to sit in a chair and watch another video of the week, with a new and disposable episode, as Kaifuku has always been.<br />
<br />
It is not just because it is an anime that has different revenge that it is being judged wrongly. It&#039;s about reusing a story that seems to be a good one, but constantly misses the initial goals, the World building and the characters, in addition to bringing a disgusting staff. Today, Kaifuku is nothing more than an object of consumption to never be seen again. It is possibly the worst show I have ever seen and this is not an exaggeration on my part, it is a personal manifestation of how it shouldn&#039;t exist.Tolerance is something that the author should know, but it seems that he will not be silent in the face of controversies, since this profits his financial balance...<br />
<br />
A definite offense... Just that...<br />
Kaifuku must be overlooked.
