<br />
I’ll be a straightforward here. I only advise watching Date a Live Season III if you are absolutely curious about the continuation of this franchise. Regardless if you’ve read the light novel or an anime only viewer, this show requires knowledge from the previous season for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304706">
        a watchable experience. With that being said, there’s little to really praise about the show together when you see what they’ve set on the table.<br />
<br />
Even before this aired, some red flags are raised regarding the technical elements of the show. The production quality from the previews seems to have taken a nose dive to hell. While the first episode made improvements compared to the online pre-air, the visual quality overall is at best be described as subpar. At worst, the third season would be a fine example of a plastic broken art piece. However, I am willing to look over this since Date a Live has never been known for its art style. It’s the standard generic harem with a cast of characters who all fall for the main protagonist eventually. The catch is that the show’s premise adheres to such genre with its dating elements.<br />
<br />
Date a Live III returns with the familiar formula of main protagonist Shido Itsuka as he helps to seal Spirits into his body with a kiss. The new season introduces Natsumi, the seventh spirit who actually has two forms – a child and young adult. The first few episodes has her play mind games against Shido and his friends. Similar to previous seasons, she puts Shido’s life on a rollercoaster of drama. However, I felt like the first arc became more and more idiotic with each passing episode. Let’s start with Natsumi herself. She is an attention seeker and seems to throw fits like a child would when things don’t go her way. In her adult form, she’s prone to jealousy with pride and a bit of ego. To put it simply, she’s an irritating character to deal with. It doesn’t take long for Shido to realize this either with the childish games she puts them through. By the time this arc ended, I felt nothing for Natsumi and she became yet another harem member in Shido’s collection. Except in her case, she&#039;s an annoying little bitch.<br />
<br />
Then, the second half of the show aired. Unlike Natsumi’s arc, the second arc adapts a more serious and emotional tone. The show takes a dive into Origami’s past while also reintroducing a popular character from the previous seasons. Oh yes, remember Origami? She’s the girl that has been trying to seduce Shido at every chance she gets. However, we see a side of Origami that people may not be used to. From this season, she shows a corrupted side of her character. She forsakes her friends while even attacking Shido as an enemy. There’s actually a more complex reason why she wants to change her past but the execution fails to live up to my expectations. Sure, there’s emotional content but the show never managed to convince me to like Origami as a character. Regardless what timeline she is in, Origami exposes the weakness of the main cast as a character who relies on others too much. In particular, Shido is someone she confides her emotions in although I never felt the two had a strong connection. Even compared to relationships with others like Tohka, she always felt like a background character. That being said, I don’t really want to devalue all the characters. The main cast returns with their mainstream personalities. While there’s not much character development, it’s still fun to watch their goofy interactions with Shido. It’s a harem after all and every girl wants their chance to be with him. The amount of witty dialogues and humor remains in the show that occasionally can draw out a few laughs. But be aware, you may quickly find most of it to be a snoozefest. <br />
<br />
If the third season really wanted to redeem itself, it could have taken risks to try something different. Instead, it still relied on its usual gimmicks while focusing on a character that I never put faith into. Here’s a season that I can’t recommend and it’s a real shame. Because really, I wanted Date a Live to be something more special. Instead, it came out as a garbage harem that can be best described as atrocious.

    Have you ever thought that life is only for dating?<br />
<br />
The story begins with a jerk young man who likes cheating when he already has a girlfriend but still wants to look for another named Shidou Itsuka, but jokes. It&#039;s back at the beginning Shidou has a mission to date some girls ... but the date he&#039;s not dating is normal. this danger is to hasten the spirit that disturbs the earth. This series now has three different studios set in series (Date A Live is sometimes cheating) in my opinion the adaptation of the third series is not much different from the previous series, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300696">
        conclude that in this series already there is no special anymore. But I appreciate that they are determined to take the risk of making this series.<br />
<br />
From the sound quality and character I like the voice part most why because they are very suitable in their respective roles. In this series there are many types or types of characters ranging from &quot;tsundere&quot; to &quot;yandere&quot; but the most awaited and desirable if it&#039;s not &quot;Tokisaki Kurumi&quot;, this one character is somehow a favorite of many people rather than playing heroin alone (Tohka).<br />
<br />
The art of JC. Staff did not seem to be anything special but they were pretty good and they were half-hearted in the advanced adaptation series. In this season Date A Live III had almost the same graphic design compared to previous series, but it was not a big problem, it was covered up with the harem theme which made all the audience jealous of the main character&#039;s situation. Overall I really enjoyed the advanced series of Date A Live, and I hope JC.Staff provides a work that can be developed in the future.

    I’ve never seen a sequel to a popular series so butchered since Michael Bay’s stand-alone film Transformers: Age of Extinction in 2014.<br />
<br />
This review is coming from someone who actually enjoyed the Date A Live series quite a bit, especially the “semi-canon” film back in 2015. So when I first heard about the series getting a third season, I was quite elated, to say the least. However, not too long after, I received the unsettling news of the original studio that handled the previous two seasons and the OVAs, Production IMS, undergoing bankruptcy and shutting down permanently, and thus the project was handed off to JC

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304719">
        Staff. At the time, the studio wasn’t exactly a hot topic of controversy or debate, so I didn’t think too much of it. Unfortunately, the issues befalling the studio have started to become more apparent in the season of Fall 2018, especially during the production of the third season of Toaru Majutsu No Index. Needless to say, regardless of whatever the financial and business reasons and so-called justifications as to why the studio is currently conducting itself as of recently, it is not a good enough excuse to brush off what has obviously has become a contagious disease known as “JC Staph Infection”.<br />
<br />
(May or may not have some spoilers*)<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
By now, anyone who watched or plans to watch this show should already know the common drill with how the story goes. A seemingly ordinary young man, Shido Itsuka, encounters and befriends beings called “Spirits”, and in order to stop them from wrecking havoc on Tenguu City, his home, he must make them fall in love with him and then seal their powers with a kiss. In the process, those Spirits become his best friends and allies and also part of the self-inserted harem.<br />
<br />
The premises of the show are quite generic but not necessarily bad at all, especially with how the previous seasons depicted certain scenes and moments as fleeting moments of emotion and beauty. However, this was absolutely not the case here with Season 3. While I try to handle animation quality and story quality separately, this is one of those cases where both seem linked to each other in a bad way. So when the animation quality dropped, so did the course and depiction of the storyline.<br />
<br />
The immediate problem I already have is how certain scenes shift so suddenly and without a proper sort of siegeway between them. Because of the entire lack of buildup between events and arcs, the scenes that are supposed to be the important chunks of the story…..just feel abstract and soulless. There is no sense of anything emotionally invested at all, not even with the most important arc of the season, the Tobiichi Origami arc. While I can’t really apply problems in terms of something like world-building, there are obvious plot holes and unwarranted plot devices throughout the story. While such occurrences are not exactly rare with most anime adaptations, Date A Live’s case during this particular season grew far too problematic.<br />
For one particular example, during the Origami Arc, Shido, having travelled back to the past to try to undo the changing of history, seemingly dies in the act of protecting a younger Origami; however, the very next scene shows him alive and well in a brand new timeline. Regardless of whether the source material contained an answer or not, there seemed to be no clear-cut explanation as to why a brand new timeline was made, much less as to how Shido isn’t dead or even erased from existence due to the possible time paradox. Additionally, the rest of the Spirits somehow regain their memories from the old timeline without much consequence. The fact that the arc relied on an often mishandled plot element known as time travel can stir up unwarranted plot devices like that. Even then, if the production crew implemented genuine emotional investment into many of the events, instead of just forcing it down our throats, such “deux ex machina” foolery would be honestly easier to overlook in at least at face value.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
Oh boy, one of my favorite parts of the review, breaking down the focused characters.’<br />
<br />
Since this is a sequel, I don’t think I really need to talk too much about the cast that took to the sidelines for this season. The main focus here are the two characters with the two primary arcs: Natsumi and Origami.<br />
Natsumi, in my honest opinion, is a very unlikeable character, even when she “turned a new leaf” due to Shido’s action. She is extremely childish, and is extremely self-loathing of her original petite form. She perceives everything in a negative light, including herself. Unwilling to accept this feeling of worthlessness, she took on a more physically mature-looking form to perceive herself as the perfect image of what she wanted to be. However, she is really just wanting attention, praising, acknowledgment, and recognition. The problem is that the show fails to depict her in a way where we can have at least some sort of sympathy of her, but instead, due to aforementioned plot holes, she comes off as more of a bipolar, bratty, complaining, and nosy child that only wants to cause trouble for everyone else just because she doesn’t feel confident about the image of her true self. If someone I become associated with does something along the lines of what Natsumi did during her arc, I would kick him or her out of the house almost instantaneously. Even after she was sealed by Shido, her mischievous, annoying personality is still there…just not as willing to cause unneeded trouble now, because she simply became a bench player from then on for the next arcs like all the other characters.<br />
<br />
Origami is a primary character from way back in season 1 that I was able to put up with for the most part, up until her segment came up here this season. What I regret now is not immediately realizing that Origami had not gotten over her desire for revenge against the Spirits, even though she has allied with them on a number of occasions. Instead, she started having a growing, self-conceited desire to obtain more power, which caused her to join the villainous group of DEM and later on obtain a Sephira Crystal to become a Spirit herself. Her reasonings for her questionable acts are more immature and unwarranted than Shinji Ikari’s reasonings to not “get in the f***ing robot”. It became all too laughable when she finally realized that she became the very monster that she had always hated since the day she swore revenge for her parents in the old timeline. Her feelings of insecurity finally reaches a breaking point when she herself became the killer of her own parents in yet another (you guessed it) “well-played” case of time paradox. She then just literally loses all her emotions and became very much mentally dead as an Inverted Spirit. By now, all of us should realize that all of these foolery caused by her during her arc would be completely prevented if her deep-rooted naivety, glossed over by her serious looking expressions, didn’t cause to her to turn to the frigging DEM, of all groups. If she opened up her eyes more and tried to look at the bright side of things or even try to think about forgiveness seriously for once, regardless of what happened back then (which is now irrelevant due to the now changed timeline), she would’ve obtained something that would qualify as ACTUAL character development. Everything about her just felt absolutely wasted in her segment, in my personal opinion. I feel like if she did need to become a Spirit, such an event should’ve been set up with a totally different situation.<br />
As for the other characters, I already stated before: they’re just mostly benchwarmers, saved for Kurumi. She actually contributed to the Origami Arc….by starting the whole time travel thing. Ugh, great. Well, at least she was sort of a saving grace in terms of enjoyment value if you’re a Kurumi fan.<br />
<br />
ART/SOUND:<br />
From the very get-go, even with re-release of the first episode, the animation was immediately something I find hard to bear on a psychological level. In contrast to what the previous installment of the series had, the characters just feel very “off”. What I received was just a discombobulation of still frames and cheaply drawn movements that made the characters look like they’re from some goofy low-budget parody show. This bombardment of slideshows consequently downplayed numerous important scenes, including the fights, and it almost hindered the ability to drive home any sort of emotional investment for even the casual viewer. It’s almost as bad as the crapfest from the second season of TG:Re. I don’t think I really need to revisit the situation regarding JC Staff, as like I stated earlier, there’s no good enough excuse to show us such a poorly made high school project.<br />
<br />
As for the soundtracks, they’re not exactly bad, but pretty meh compared to the previous seasons. While it was nice to hear some of the old soundtracks, it wasn’t really enough to make us ignore how awkward the majority of the scenes are visually displayed. The voice acting here is pretty mediocre; it really feels like the seiyuus are just rushing their lines as the show zips through different scenes without much of a proper transition between them. I can only fathom how depressed they are as they realize how poor the show’s quality became while they read off from the scripts.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
Needless to say, watching the show felt like a chore, which made me really depressed as this was part of a series that I really enjoyed, even though it’s not a particular personal favorite. I did not want to drop this show because my mindset as a completionist kept giving me this false hope that the show will turn around. However, a part of me is resigned to the virtue I follow: “for every good or great show, try to watch at least a bad one to balance out your experience.” So I stuck with it until the end, but boy it was a pain train to behold. While I did get some sort of kick out of scenes like Natsumi trying to seduce Shido or Kurumi making her reappearance, I don’t get much else outside of the heavy shelling of my PC from the agonizing display of still frames and laughable overplayed voice acting.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Date A Live III was a tragic case of a sequel being handled by the wrong people, though it definitely isn’t the only one for sure. If you didn’t really enjoy the previous seasons for some reason, I’ll highly advise you to avoid this trash at all costs. If you’re like me and actually did enjoy the previous installments, though, prepare yourself for lots of cringe and agony as you watch a near perfect example of how to NOT handle a sequel season. Or you can just nope out and completely avoid the torture chamber that I went through.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, this atrocity will inevitably reflect badly on JC Staff, and while I’d hope they’ll learn from their mistakes eventually, it’ll be quite a long while until the day we stop shaking our heads in disappointment when we hear the news “JC Staff will take over for production of this show/season”.<br />

    YES, finally after 5 years, we&#039;re seeing the light of Date A Live once again...thank you Tachibana-sensei (the author of the series)!<br />
NO, to production woes, the J.C.Staff that could do no wrong, proceeded to trash this series! Where are you ENGI???<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit, being a long-time DAL fan ever since its inception in 2013 has its benefits and drawbacks. For one, we get a fairly generic harem story and action that was somewhat interesting and intriguing for its time, its lineup of character Spirits and the MC harem &quot;Master&quot; that is Shido Itsuki, that left us wanting for more of them ever since Season 2&#039;s end

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304710">
        in 2014. But finally, and with a very long wait, the original LN writer Koushi Tachibana has green-lit Season 3 for long-time fans like us to once again, MILK on the success that is the past 2 seasons. AND...you all saw how that fared out in 3 months. And that&#039;s a massive disappointment.<br />
<br />
*Spoilers be warned*<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story, which continues the events from past DAL series into Volumes 8 to 12 of the Light Novel: The 7th and 8th Spirits Natsumi and the resurrected Tobiichi Origami in her Spirit form, along with the (rushed and story-squished) Itsuka Disaster arc. For the majority of the series, we go through the life and happenings of the transformation queen that is Natsumi, being able to shapeshift into people with almost perfect results. And this time, Shido is left with a very daunting task of finding out Natsumi&#039;s real intentions while covering her true chibi-kid form (which makes her embarrassed and is a real pain-in-the-butt), at the expense of using Tohka and Co. and exterminating them should Shido fail to solve her puzzle. Everything totally felt like how the main series was intended to be, and that&#039;s always very welcome.<br />
<br />
Next, new revelations about the friend-cum-enemy Tobiichi Origami, whom for the longest time that we&#039;ve been searching her long-awaited answers since the start of Season 1: The reasoning behind her hatred for Spirits. And this arc being animated is a true taste of the &quot;how many questions&quot; we all have at the end of both seasons, finally giving us the action-solutions and resolution to Origami&#039;s antagonistic purposes, with her history being rewritten at long last, for the better. Last but not least, the Itsuka Disaster arc, where in true DAL fashion, Shido does not become the initiator, but becomes the instigated for the girls to date him! Of course, trouble ensues but as always the girls will do anything to save his life *kisses*.<br />
<br />
Once again, open hearts, open minds: The story is a love/hate relationship with those of us who grew up with this series, so whether you love or hate it, I respect all opinions.<br />
<br />
The characters, or should I mention, the NEW ones brought forth to this season: Natsumi, Origami&#039;s new Spirit form and of course the mysterious Spirit that is Phantom. Natsumi, aside from her Halloween costume, she is a force to be reckoned with, with her shapeshifting disguises into people similar being the standout that really causes a whole lot of issues. Once she is brought down to her tsundere loli form, she is pretty much like Yoshino in terms of care and sensitivity. With Origami&#039;s position this time, she is finally vindicated of her past that has her holding back for very long, siding with DEM Industries all the while until this issue is resolved. Good for you Origami! And Phantom&#039;s presence which we didn&#039;t see a lot of, that is sadly left for another time to pursue more information about her (in the future...?). Of course, Tohka and Co. still acts like their usual selves.<br />
<br />
The elephant in the room, you&#039;ve guessed it, is the art and animation, which by all accounts, factoring in both Season 1 and 2, is the worst looking of them all. With the relevant production studio changes (AIC Plus+ for Season 1, the recently-bankrupt Production IMS for Season 2), it&#039;s no surprise that this is an (industry-wide) issue, but honestly I didn&#039;t find the average art-animation combi to be off-putting, at least not by a mile. With J.C.Staff however, even before the anime aired, the PV and posters were the red flags that long-time fans were trashing it, saying: &quot;This isn&#039;t the DAL that I remember!&quot; And...it doesn;t get any better than this. Character models have that superifical J.C.Staff generic model, instead of the ever-so-memorable DAL aesthetics. Art and animation is decent, but action scenes were rife with mediocrity all around, with many people were complaining that this series took a turn for the worse with overall animation, and my opinions are no different. Sure, ENGI came back to help out with the production woes that J.C.Staff faced (that&#039;s evident on the episodes he worked on if you checked the ED credits), but overall, it definitely left a very sour taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
Music-wise, I&#039;m very glad and happy that the all-female group &quot;sweet ARMS&quot; is back once again to deliver another stellar song, titled &quot;I Swear&quot; (by the moon and the stars and the sky...oops sorry, wrong song!). Probably out of the 3 OP songs in the series, this may just be my favourite &quot;sweet ARMS&quot; song yet, with Season 1&#039;s &quot;Date A Live&quot; in 2nd place. Such a heartwarming and cute, small action-pumping song. New and upcoming female artist Eri Yamazaki shows her new song for the ED, and it&#039;s also quite good (as expected from Shichisei no Subaru&#039;s ED song). OST wise, it&#039;s largely the same assortment of tracks from previous series to stoke nostalgia, and it works for the better.<br />
<br />
Production woes aside, as predictable and obvious as much as past seasons are, this is still a somewhat worthy (but worse) sequel entry to the series, with the story still holding up just as decent with many hiccups in the storytelling. But, apologies to long-time DAL fans both old and new, this isn&#039;t recommended unless it&#039;s for the story alone. Pass this up.<br />
<br />
Now if only there was ever a chance of a Season 4 (which is highly unlikely), we the audience highly implore the future production staff: &quot;Please get the series QC-checked first before showing it to us!&quot;

    Hello there everyone, I am writing this review as a former big fan of the series. Nothing written in this review is intended to hurt anyone&#039;s feelings and pride.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned just now, I am a big Former fan of the anime Date A Live. The reason for it is the third season being a massive disappointment for myself. It is very noticeable just how much the quality of production for this anime dropped after second season: there is a huge amount of so-called static &quot;filler&quot; frames and animation quality is quite poor. However, that is not the only reason why I came to dislike

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302820">
        this season. <br />
<br />
Characters and Character Development. (4)<br />
I wouldn&#039;t lie if I say most of the characters are very likeable, including new heroine, Natsumi. BUT, most of the character development in this anime feels very cliched and I&#039;d say not very well described. For that reason alone, at some points, the anime gets quite embarrassing to watch. 50 percent of Shidou&#039;s (main character&#039;s) behavior is screaming in frustration, anger, desperation even when there is really no reason to. Characters actions are very predictable and lack character. Like I said before, I like the characters in this anime a lot. All of the heroines are very cute, adorable, have well-told backstories (thanks to Season 1 &amp; 2) and variety of traits that make them unique in some way or another. It&#039;s just that I personally didn&#039;t find this season&#039;s way of character expression and development any good at all, especially if you want to compare the third season to season one and two. For the points mentioned above, I give Characters a 4 for this season.<br />
<br />
Story. (3)<br />
The story is so far (At the time of writing this review, I&#039;ve watched 8 episodes of the third season of Date A Live) plain and doesn&#039;t keep me excited nor interested. Sometimes, it feels like arcs change so suddenly, with no transition, that there is a feeling of plot holes at certain moments. I know it&#039;s not rare, especially for anime adaptations to have skips through some moments inbetween episodes, but, for an animation of such a nice light novel, I would at least expect it to be somewhat consistent with story telling and links between certain chapters.<br />
<br />
Art. (3)<br />
As mentioned earlier, the anime is filled with static frames and cheap &quot;filler&quot; frames. Animation sometimes lacks momentum and sometimes has too much of it. So far I have not noticed a single animation sequence which I would consider well made for an adaptation of such a great light novel. Art quality is very inconsistent and sometimes looks so bad that it makes me want to stop watching the episode as soon as I see it. I&#039;m still a big fan of Date A Live 1 and 2&#039;s art style but, when animation production quality isn&#039;t anywhere near the first and second season&#039;s, it just makes you, as a big fan of the original work, quite sad.<br />
<br />
Sound. (7)<br />
Sound is okay. Nothing really stands out in terms of sound effects for me Except, a beautiful opening song, I swear by sweet ARMS. This one has to be one of my favorite opening songs ever, and I am a huge fan of it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. (3)<br />
With all of the points above, I couldn&#039;t enjoy this season much, even though, as mention many times in this review, I&#039;m a Big fan of this series and original work.<br />
<br />
Overall. (3)<br />
The only thing that stood out for me in this whole season was a beautiful opening, and as for the anime itself, it&#039;s rather disappointing.<br />
<br />

    It&#039;s Origami&#039;s time to shine!<br />
<br />
Date A Live III was unexpected for LA let alone it now being taken over by JC Staff for animation, but aside from that, this season looks at Natsumi and Origami&#039;s arc and boy are they good, especially Origami&#039;s.<br />
<br />
LA will note before going on that besides Kurumi being the best character in the entire show bar none, LA actually liked Origami VERY early on for being such an interesting character, of being the deadpan stoic character yet not a shy one but a trickster one and she just runs with that personality that not only slips up Shidou but nearly the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304783">
        entire cast due to how strange her behavior is and for the better and now due to this third season, we finally get her proper backstory and her reasoning of her hatred of Sprits and it&#039;s not pretty.<br />
<br />
So Natsumi&#039;s arc isn&#039;t that bad as if anything it&#039;s gives us the entire cast in some crazy situations made from Natsumi and Shidou trying to seal her, of course since this is her arc we get her base personality and her powers and by the end of it, she just becomes like Yoshino but a tsundere instead once she&#039;s sealed. Nonetheless the situations Natsumi gets Shidou in was....comedically funny to say the least, from the arc with a &quot;spot who the imposter is&quot; that gets lethal to uhhh....half the cast turning into loli&#039;s (no seriously). Natsumi later on gets some more screentime during Origami&#039;s arc but nonetheless LA does see that she had some merit and her character wasn&#039;t wasted either...unlike Yoshino for LA.<br />
<br />
Origami&#039;s arc was the climax of the entire anime and really we finally see after 2 seasons why she has beef with Spirits in the first place and after knowing all this LA can sympathize with her of course but it&#039;s her actions that causes the majority of the predicaments in her own arc and it&#039;s up to Shidou and weirdly enough Kurumi to stop Origami spiraling out of control. Like Natsumi&#039;s arc, Origami gives us an interesting perspective on the cast as yeah..since Kurumi is involved...time travel of course comes into a factor and LA will say the time travel is dealt with rather well. But seeing Origami actually be a complex character deep down her deadpan stoicism was great for a fan of Origami and bonus for Kurumi being in on the action as well at that.<br />
<br />
Westcott from the second season is also brought up much more prominently now in this season and he had a hand in both of Natsumi and Origami&#039;s arc and his forces are in action to his enacted plans for a new world order. he like his company name is a Deux Ex Machina in the worst of times just to make it even harder for Shidou and co.<br />
<br />
The animation done by aforementioned JC Staff was done &quot;ok&quot; in all respects, from the character designs, fights and background work, yes the animation does tend to dip at times and struggles in some fight scenes but nonetheless, LA can forgive it for the plot. Spotty but not horrible is all LA will say about the animation.<br />
<br />
Voice acting, well we have all the returning voice actors again. The only thing LA will talk about is the MVP&#039;s and that easily goes to Misuzu Togashi as Origami and Asami Sanada as Kurumi.<br />
<br />
If there were any flaws towards this season, then it&#039;ll squarely go to Shidou as she&#039;s pretty much static, sure he gets upgrades from bonding with the newer Spirits and he&#039;s the textbook definition of a white knight trying to protect everyone at the cost of himself and he&#039;s much more reactionary in this season than any other, this might be due to this season dedicating itself to Natsumi and Origami but LA can give Shidou some leeway as both their arcs kinda gets intense so Shidou as a character is pushed aside because of it.<br />
<br />
Date A Live III for LA is a great step in the right direction, from the near aimless second season and in line with the original first season. Sure the change in animation studio is a detriment, but if it&#039;s for the plot and all the tense stuff and backstories from character that NEEDED it then Date A Live III is great in this regards.

    First thing first I never give numeral scores and instead just categorized anime series I have watched to either masterpiece,enjoyable,not enjoyable,finished and regret,dropped.<br />
<br />
I put DaL III in enjoyable category.<br />
Remember there&#039;re objective &quot;features&quot; but there&#039;re no objective review in my &quot;world&quot; because we&#039;re human we always bias. So why the nonsense? I actually enjoy this show quite much, this is no Busou Shoujo no whatever-the-f-is-that nor Seiken Tsukai nor Seirei Tsukai and not (insert your fanservice focused harem here). The concept is original and unique(maybe;read=for me) ,characters are likeable ,the VA&#039;s simply matched.<br />
<br />
I mean we get this being called Spirit that manifest as a girl, has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301494">
        super natural power, has their own outfits which is cute, has their own weapons(they call it Angel) and fighting, they even has something called &quot;inverse&quot; to make things more interesting. And all of that would really be amazing if this show has actually good animation wrap it. The first season simply has amazing animation but then it just got worse in second season and worse in third season. J.C just butchered this third season by bad and half-hearted animation(slideshow?), no they just like make this simply for those tv slot and merchandise purpose. I mean where those ice that Yoshino used and those purple light which Tooka&#039;s dominant color, where the amazing transformation sequence in first season go.<br />
<br />
So if people ask me whether to watch this or no?My answer is yes if you have watched previous seasons which is a must to get the story and whats actually going on and while you at it you can see for yourself how the animation got worse over time. Otherwise no watch other show.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
Since to write a review giving numeral scores is mandatory in mal, I&#039;ll just assume this<br />
-dropped=1<br />
-not enjoyable=3<br />
-finished and regret=5<br />
-enjoyable=7<br />
-masterpiece=9<br />
Why no 0 and 10? Well 0 is just trash where 10 is just overrated in my casexD

    Warning: This review contains a little bit of spoilers. Of course it has spoilers, its a review what did you expect?<br />
<br />
First of all Date A Live is my favorite anime of all time I got so excited when I saw the announcement that it will have a 3rd season I waited until I saw the trailer I&#039;m a real Date A Live fan and it hurts for me to say this but still I will say my opinion.<br />
<br />
Story - 7<br />
The story didn&#039;t change a bit and it makes you feel happy and cringey at the same time, but I got excited when I saw Rinne

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302396">
        in the opening theme and as we know Rinne is an exclusive character in the game &quot;Date A Live: Rinne Utopia&quot; <br />
<br />
Art - 5<br />
The art looks crap than the last 2 seasons, but still I endured it I thought they are too excited the 2-4 episodes were good until 5 to 7 the art looks so crap the fight scene between Tohka and Origami are bad, even the kissing scene it doesn&#039;t look legit at all.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7 <br />
The opening and ending theme are quite good I would love to download them.<br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
I know some of you would disagree but I like the new character&#039;s angel it can transform anything into anything, imagine if they can copy the strongest spirit&#039;s angel maybe they could keep up with it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8<br />
Even though the art looks crap than the first 2 seasons I still like Date A Live probably because of Tohka I like the way she&#039;s drawn it looks cute. (pls don&#039;t hate me Kurumi fans)<br />
<br />
Overall - 8<br />
I like the fact that they created another season but please don&#039;t make the anime especially Tohka&#039;s art and animation crap. If the staff wants to compensate for this maybe they can create another season but with a much better art and animation and also I&#039;m expecting the anime to cover the whole light novel adaptation to make the viewers happy.

    We had all been waiting eagerly for this. It was roughly half a year late, they swtiched out people working on the project yet they still did manage to pull off a quiet impressive work that I can say that I really enjoyed watching and I would no even like to see more of this. The amount of work and the level of quality that has been put into this is qiuet impressive, they even made separate animations for different intros to not spoil anything as you continued to watch. <br />
<br />
The music is intruiging and the buildup is always really epic and just wants you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311084">
        to keep going, which really is what this series has mostly going for it, besides the interesting plot and good character design.<br />
<br />
The animation quailty does have a little bit of room for improvement though. More shaders and lighting could have made the animation quality a bit better as well as more detailed explosions and effects, but already the way that it is, it certainly is not bad and is actually on the side of the better pieces of animation works that I have seen<br />
<br />
Overall I give this a 9/10. Defenetly a recommendation for people who liked the previous seasons or similar animes

    I hope that by the time we get to volume...20 or so in the adaptation, we don&#039;t end up just going through every conceivable animation studio to make this thing.  <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Find the spirit, date the girl, make her fall in love, seal the deal with a kiss.  Like its predecessors, Date A Live III continues the story of Itsuka Shido and the crew of the Ratatoskr as this strange boy capable of sealing the mysterious spirits finds and helps the girls, both old and new, while starting to uncover the mystery of the spirits and their origin.<br />
<br />
Covering roughly volumes 8-12 of the light novel, DAL III

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304802">
        arrives at roughly the point where I regard the story as expanding on the narrative and the mystery of the series by tying up a few loose ends and introducing a few new ones to further fill in the blanks.  It&#039;s by far the most interesting (and convoluted) part of the series thus far and deserves praise for just throwing itself out there despite its copy/pasted plot, which to the show&#039;s credit is a lot less &#039;Date A Live&#039; than normal given there are a lot less dates, Shido&#039;s typical &#039;harem protagonist&#039; reactions are well warranted given the absurdity of particular situations that occur around him, it&#039;s not ALL about the girls falling in love with him since their stories take more precedence, and the plot is (usually) more serious overall, especially in the latter half.<br />
<br />
Of course inherent flaws with the series are still existent: Shido despite being more of an active protagonist doesn&#039;t feel all that important in the long run, the series is still about the girls so the one in the spotlight takes the forefront of everything despite anything else that happens, and tonal/pacing breaks are still jarring at times with instances of the series feeling rushed or too slow depending on what&#039;s going on due to how much material is being condensed in a small timeframe.  It&#039;s the last point that particularly irks me because not enough of the plot seems to sink in enough for the audience to process what&#039;s going on before we&#039;re thrown into a dramatic fight scene without properly understanding who or what is participating at any given time.  <br />
<br />
Another troublesome point is the last episode.  I don&#039;t know why they decided to squeeze the entire plot of volume 12 into episode 12.  It takes at least 2-3 episodes to get through one volume, and all of this season&#039;s issues become crystal clear here where nothing feels coherent because missing context, details, and reasons to give a damn are all but non-existent.<br />
<br />
Overall, DAL III is a decent narrative improvement over what we were presented in previous seasons due to the length and severity of arcs given more time than usual, Shido seems to continue having agency over his actions now we&#039;re post-Miku, and the overall narrative of the series is more explored with a decent enough time dedicated to expanding on the mystery of the spirits that&#039;s yet to really be revealed.  However because of inherent series problems as well as production and time issues on J.C.&#039;s side with pacing issues rushing on parts so much of the series that really needed time to sink in, a lot of what could&#039;ve been good just isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Shido this time seems to stay on-character with his growth and determination to save the various spirit girls that come into his life, fervently trying his best to convince the girls at hand that he will take on their burden as cliched as that sounds.  But a lot of it feels really hollow in comparison to what we ended up with in Season 2.  Most of the time this season it feels like he&#039;s just screaming out the words without any merit behind them.  I partly blame this on the adaptation&#039;s pacing because it feels like we&#039;re skipping over A LOT of important scenes to merit Shido giving the spiel to the girls that they don&#039;t have to continue being a terror on society, which really is a shame considering one of the girls this time is someone who&#039;s been around since the BEGINNING and to have that feel less impactful makes me feel a little cheated.<br />
<br />
Since the series this time primarily covers the material from Natsumi Search to Tobiichi Devil, the featured girls this time is the 7th spirit, Natsumi, and Origami, which thanks to poster arts and several promotional material, arrives (finally) as the 8th spirit.<br />
<br />
Nicknamed &#039;Witch&#039;, Natsumi continues the chain of &#039;unconventional&#039; captures where her story and involvement of the series mixes up the formula due to her aloof qualities and conflicting nature, sporting a confident facade that masks how little she thinks of herself, which really shows how this series can portray these personal issues of the girls and put them in a good limelight.  If they get the time that is.  Because pacing is such a major issue this season, Natsumi&#039;s issues don&#039;t feel as fleshed out over the course of the time she&#039;s given and ultimately feels contrived in the end because her arc ended up being a lot shorter than I expected, especially with the whole climax of it seemingly coming out of fucking nowhere since not enough time was devoted to really showing off what&#039;s happening in the background.<br />
<br />
Instead, most of the season&#039;s runtime is devoted to Origami, who has quite possibly the most expansive and interesting arc the series has had thus far.  Becoming the things she hates, learning the truth of the death of her parents, Shido&#039;s resolve to save his stalker, all culminating in a final scene where everyone bands together to cull the sadness and loneliness from this girl&#039;s life?  Origami honestly just feels like she&#039;s going through the motions of her story without BEING her story.  It&#039;s the disconnect of character vs. plot that makes what&#039;s happening to her feel a lot less genuine than I expected.  Now that&#039;s not to say it&#039;s all bad, as the latter half of her arc definitely lived up to some of my expectations, but the way it started felt so rocky and half baked that I actually wondered if I was even watching the same series because it just didn&#039;t click in the way I wanted it to.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast from all of the other girls to all of the side characters more or less fall to the wayside as the structure of DAL is NOT kind to anyone that isn&#039;t Shido or the 10 or so girls he&#039;s got attached to his hip.  A shame too considering this is supposed to really be the point where antagonistic motivation starts arising from the depths, and we don&#039;t really get enough of that beyond one or two instances that happens in the middle of the series.  I was honestly expecting it to happen a few more times, but...I guess that&#039;s happening in DAL IV.  If that&#039;s even happening.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
Going from AIC+ to Production IMS, DAL now finds its new home in J.C. Staff (since everyone else basically crashed and burned) which compared to the other two looks the worst out of the three!  While the series still has the feel of Tsunako&#039;s original artstyle, the colors this time are a LOT more dull and don&#039;t have enough of light in any aspect of the color scheme to compare to what was achieved from the other two seasons.  This issue also extends to the way the characters are drawn as model irregularities are semi-common and there&#039;s apparent stiffness with the characters as they literally stand in place with a few mouth flaps to ensure the characters are talking rather than anything natural to make them seem more in tune with the environment, which is made even more apparent with models of the cast in distance shots appearing a lot worse than previous seasons.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, the overall quality of the animation feels like it suffered a lot due to how little movement or any kind of dynamic fighting that occurs this season, much less enough particle effects to make the series really stand out since there aren&#039;t as many &#039;spirit&#039; effects, flashy sword slashes, or what have you to fill in the action requirement of the show.<br />
<br />
Thankfully though, there is one consistent factor that stays with DAL, hopefully till the day the adaptation dies because they&#039;re probably contractually obligated to do so since two of their members are VAs for the show.  Once again, the OP &quot;I Swear&quot; is sung by Sweet Arms, and is quite possibly my favorite of all three of the OPs (four if you count the movie) that they&#039;ve done.  The tone and energy of the song resonates well with the tone of the series, which is made even better when the lyrics literally spell out what happens in the second half better than what what we see happen in the second half.  Conversely Erii Yamazaki&#039;s &quot;Last Promise&quot; just isn&#039;t as good in comparison.  Compared to &quot;Day to Story&quot; in Season 2, this ED just doesn&#039;t really do it for me, which is a shame because I really wanted to know how they were gonna top that amazing ED.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the show still has the same OST as it had back in DAL II, so for that I&#039;m also thankful considering just how good that OST is and how well it actually increases the severity of any situation despite whatever&#039;s happening not seeming all that dire.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
J.C. staff is like that communal trash can that the industry seems to be defaulting to whenever a series license is begging to get made but no one else is willing to take the dive.  (Happened to High Score Girl too.)  I have been waiting years, years for this season to come out because we were finally, FINALLY getting to the start of the &#039;endgame&#039; where the series would start focusing on more serious narratives, and the stories of the girls would start to getting more interesting and in a sense, completely shave off the &#039;Date&#039; part of the series&#039;s title.  As DAL is quite possibly my favorite series, I am ultimately very disappointed with what J.C. Staff ended up doing to season 3.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t feel like very much effort was put into this adaptation.  Natsumi and Origami seemed to really have their arcs sped through for the sake of &#039;getting it done&#039;, Shido feels like he had the potential to be a much better protagonist than he ultimately ended up becoming, and why in the hell did you people think that producing &#039;Itsuka Disaster&#039; alongside some of the largest arcs in the entire story of the light novel up to this point was a great idea?!  Seriously, that shit was so sped up I feel like even one more episode could&#039;ve made that entire thing so much better.  J.C. Staff&#039;s track record has always been pretty spotty, so seeing DAL essentially lose the coin flip was extremely disheartening, made even worse now that since AIC+ and Production IMS are bankrupt and basically no longer exist, J.C. Staff will most likely be the permanent home of this series, and if this season is any indication, I am NOT looking forward to the future.<br />
<br />
Honestly, even for DAL fans, I don&#039;t particularly think that this adaptation is even worth watching.  Season 2 is starting to seem like the cutting point where the adaptation is worth watching, and the rest of the series should just be experienced in the original source material.  Koushi Tachibana certainly isn&#039;t an amazing LN author given some of the questionable material that&#039;s present in DAL, but experiencing the series as it was originally shown is definitely an upgrade to J.C. Staff&#039;s half baked attempt at adapting it.

             [This review assumes you&#039;ve watched all previous Date A Live seasons as well as Mayuri&#039;s Judgment and are familiar with the characters and concepts]<br />
   <br />
      Date A Live was the anime that made me interested in watching anime. For some reason it had this weird appeal that made me curious to explore the medium. Much like many people&#039;s first anime it has stuck with me and I still enjoy it today despite how my views on anime have changed overtime. So, when I heard that Date A Live was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304807">
        finally getting a 3rd season, I was naturally excited. However, knowing how flawed the series was already I wasn&#039;t expecting much from Date A Live 3 and frankly I got about what I expected.<br />
<br />
        The story of this season follows the same pattern as previous seasons, with the only real difference being the characters that each arc focuses on. The first arc focuses on the new spirit Natsumi. Her arc feels extremely weak, and that&#039;s mostly because of her character. Natsumi serves as the main antagonist of her own arc, similar to Miku. However, unlike Miku, Natsumi is never given a compelling reason to act as an antagonist. Her backstory is never really explored nor is she given a compelling motivation to act the way she does. It doesn&#039;t help that she&#039;s mostly absent for a good portion of her arc. For the most part, she watches Shido and makes very brief appearances from time to time. Very little meaningful time is actually spent with her and even when she does get some screen time, it doesn&#039;t delve too deep into her character. As a result, her personality and motives are very vague for the entire arc. Unlike the other spirits, Natsumi was uncompelling, unlikable, and had no other redeeming qualities that made me care about her. Another problem with Natsumi&#039;s arc is how it tries to blend in a subplot involving another villain, Issac. The only real purpose of this was to set up for something that might occur later in the story, but for this season it was mostly useless. This time setting up Issac&#039;s plan really should have been used for something better, like developing Natsumi&#039;s character. This arc suffers a lot from its pacing, making it a lot more shallow than it should be. <br />
<br />
     The next arc is a a bit better, but still has its own share of flaws. The second arc of this season focuses on Origami and her past. This arc mostly serves as way to fill in some of the gaps involving Origami&#039;s characters and to further explain the reasoning behind her hatred for spirits. It was nice to see some meaningful development from Origami who always felt kinda shallow, especially when it came for her love for Shido. For the most part Date A Live 3 does an adequate job of exploring Origami and reveals a lot of the mysteries behind her character. Though it was nice to finally explore Origami, this arc was extremely confusing and added so many more plot holes. I won&#039;t spoil to much but this arc involves using Kurumi&#039;s time powers in order to travel back 5 years ago, before Origami&#039;s parents were killed. While time travel can be an interesting plot device to use in a story, it requires great care in order to be done properly. Date A Live, however, doesn&#039;t properly explain the rules of how its time travel works, and as a result many seemingly inexplicable things occur. I could always make sense of the Date A Live universe(despite how nonsensical and stupid it is), but this time travel arc had so many inconsistencies that I just gave up trying to make sense of all it. This added level of confusion plus poor pacing made this arc almost unfollowable. Despite this Origami&#039;s arc still kept my interest and for the most part I wasn&#039;t actually bothered by many of the inconsistencies of the plot. <br />
<br />
     The other spirits of Date A Live are still present and they are the same likable characters from the previous seasons. At this point of the story there are 9 main spirits and it was definitely going to be challenge to juggle so many characters at once. Despite this, I think Date A Live 3 does an adequate job at making them all feel relevant. Each character contributes at least a little to the plot and they still feel like a part of the story. The comedy also maintains the same charm of the other seasons. While the antics that Shido&#039;s harem get into are par for the course of any harem anime, I still enjoyed the comedy because the characters added an extra bit of charm to it. Some of them even get a little more character development, which helped flesh them out a bit more. As someone who really likes the characters of Date A Live, I appreciated how it handled the non essential characters.<br />
     <br />
     Unfortunately, this season&#039;s animation was frankly one of the worst I&#039;ve seen in awhile. Most of the characters look really ugly and were often  disproportional. A lot of the simple animation looked really terrible and awkward. Even the fight animation looked terrible and lacks any impact. To be fair previous seasons didn&#039;t exactly have great animation either, but Date A Live 3 makes them look like masterpieces. I honestly think this show looks worse than most of the terribly animated shows that were released about a decade ago, and there is no excuse for it. Thankfully Date A Live maintains its fantastic soundtrack and the OP and ED are as great as ever. <br />
<br />
     For all of Date A Live 3&#039;s glaring problem, like its story and animation, I still managed to enjoy it. Date A Live 3 provided that Date A Live sequel I&#039;ve been waiting for and that was enough for me to still enjoy it. While I might like it Date A Live 3 is undeniable a real mess of an anime and I can only really recommend it if you unconditionally love the franchise like me. <br />
<br />

    It&#039;s been a while, hasn&#039;t it? It sure has. Five years, in fact. It sure baffles me that there are people out there that actually wanted more of Date A Live. I thought, after the disaster that was the 2nd season, that people would reject it similarly to Infinite Stratos&#039; 2nd season that turned out so bad they only released two OVAs and nothing else afterward. Now we get the 3rd installment from none other than J.C. Staff. After I finished watching this, it was evident that they weren&#039;t precisely giving this season to their A-team if you get my drift.

Date A Live

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312724">
        was actually the first anime I reviewed that was currently airing at the time. Looking back on it, as much as I did like certain aspects of the show, I could not remember a thing about what the plot was or who the characters were outside of their beautiful designs. Tsunako&#039;s awesome character designs can really save a character&#039;s worth even with the generic development that goes with them. Granted, there were genuinely funny moments sprinkled here and there that I do look fondly back. But other than that, Date A Live Season 1 was mostly too generic for me to give it any more cred than that. Once Season 2 came along, I was so flabbergasted by how the quality dropped significantly on almost every aspect that I didn&#039;t care enough to actually review it, that&#039;s how bad it was. Now, does Season 3 elevate the quality up just a little?<br />
<br />
The answer is: Yes, but very very minimally by a decimal point.<br />
<br />
For one thing, the animation is still not as flashy or colorful as Season 1&#039;s which I still consider being that season&#039;s most substantial highlight. It is a step above 2&#039;s only because the colors aren&#039;t as muted on the character designs. But I noticed a lot of character movements that feel stiff, many instances of using still images, and action scenes not being that interesting to look at. I mentioned before how J.C. Staff weren&#039;t giving this to their A-team, and it is clear that they were not showing off their animation prowess compared to their other more significant projects. It&#039;s sad because I am a fan of Tsunako&#039;s artwork and to see her creation not being given a big enough budget to see her art in motions is saddening.<br />
<br />
There are two main story plot points in the 1st and 2nd half of the season; three if you count the 12th episode, but we&#039;ll get to that later. One involving a &quot;witch&quot; named Natsumi that Shido has to smitten for her to not turn evil. The main problem with this story is the character of Natsumi herself. She is not particularly likable in any way and we are supposed to feel some sort of empathy towards her torment because of how she sees herself in her true form. This true form of hers does not make her sympathetic for all the evil deeds she&#039;s done and comes off utterly selfish to the point where I could not care enough for whatever was going to happen to her. The episode that involved the other girls turning into little children version of themselves was actually entertaining in its own dumb, superficial way. But as a whole, it was not the best way to start off the season with.<br />
<br />
Onto the plot involving the quiet, stoic, white-haired angel Origami, this one was at least better than the previous story. However, instead of being annoyed, I was mostly bored and uninterested in how they made Origami grow as a character. This has always been my problem with the rest of the cast in Date A Live: I like their archetypes, but not their characters. What I mean is, I love their personalities and how they clash one another in hilarious circumstances but not necessarily their character arcs that get involved in the main story because the story itself is so drab and barebones. With Origami&#039;s plot, it was interesting to see her with long hair and with a more expressive personality later on in the season. Nevertheless, as a character, nothing about her is interesting due to the nature of the generic writing that has been prevalent throughout the season.<br />
<br />
Now we have got to talk about the dreaded 12th episode. Basically, to sum it up briefly, they wrote an entire episode to adapt an entire volume. The result is an absolutely hilarious rushed episode of anything I have ever seen. It was almost as if 1/3rd of the episode was adapting a few chapters of the volume and then quickly switch to a completely different story in the next 1/3rd of the episode. It almost felt like an OVA episode that they didn&#039;t even bother to put out separately. They just put it as the last episode to fill in that 12 episode gap in broadcasting to milk in more TV viewers because they had no faith that this would sell as an OVA.<br />
<br />
In many ways, this is the worst of the season, but in others, it&#039;s kind of a toss-up between this and the 2nd season for me. In plot, it is for sure worse in how it is structured, but from a technical perspective, it wasn&#039;t a complete disaster like the 2nd season was in some aspects. It is such a shame because I genuinely wanted Date A Live to at least be a solid harem anime that I would enjoy. However, it suffers from the same problems many ecchi/harem anime go through when they try to put a serious story to it: they do not put enough effort into making a cohesive story that is engrossing to experience and instead focuses on flashy action and ecchi fanservice. Which, again, I&#039;m not against whatsoever. However, if you can&#039;t do both right, just make an anime that does one thing great rather than one thing decent and another terribly.<br />

    Alright, I&#039;ll be honest here. Most of you are saying that season 3 was absolute garbage and you know what? I agree, why? Because the light novel is very different from the anime! <br />
<br />
From where season 2 left off, s3 start with miku coming into the spirit mansion when in the light novel, Miku, kotori and shido were discussing about phantom and how Miku got the power. <br />
<br />
And the latest episode, don&#039;t even consider it canon, it was suppose to be the start of season 4 and episode 12 of season 3 should&#039;ve been that shido side story.<br />
<br />
And you would think, about how the plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358832">
        of the season 3 flow, it doesn&#039;t make senes, of course it doesn&#039;t. Motonaga Keitoro has been leaving out important scenes! Which is why it&#039;s getting so many hates. So my conclusion is that rather than going for the anime, I suggest that you go for the light novel. It&#039;s much bette.

    The third season of Date A Live is a massive letdown. <br />
<br />
The show reuses the same formula as its predecessors; Shido (you should know him by now) encounters a Spirit, conflict arises - usually by ludicrous means -  and another gal gets included into his harem. However, almost half of the anime is focused on one girl, and the other half is focused on the development of another. <br />
<br />
The dialogue is laughable, basic lines including Shido screaming, “Why are you doing this!?”, or “I know you’re not evil!”. His harem is no different, offering one-dimensional mumbo-jumbo about their harem daddy. Funnily enough, it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304725">
        only until some action ensues that they’re able to form some kind of intellect. As for the new girl, Natsumi, her reasoning for torturing the guy is just absolutely petty, if not just plain stupid. Let’s look at how it all started.<br />
<br />
Natsumi acts like a sexy oneesan (ara ara) towards Shido<br />
*Enemy troops attack*<br />
*Natsumi’s true form is briefly shown*<br />
Natsumi: “You saw, right?”<br />
“Don’t play dumb!”<br />
“You saw my…”<br />
“Unforgivable.”<br />
*Points index finger towards Shido*<br />
“Your life… it’s about to be over for good!”<br />
<br />
If I was in Shido’s place, I would have slapped her back to where she came from, even if she was one dangerous oneesan (she ends up being a loli, how disappointing). Is this really how you treat your fans after four years? <br />
<br />
After her arc is dealt with, we never get to see her backstory, and it is only ever implied. At least in Tohka and Yoshino’s case, they have somewhat reasonable character development in their respective arcs, but Natsumi on the other hand looks and feels like a copy-paste Tsundere loli, and she acts the part as well. You can say she barely had any screen time compared to the aforementioned two, but the rest of the characters in Shido’s harem are just the same. They sprinkle tons of generic flirting and teasing, add in some basic lines about how they love their “darling”, and then finally act as filler for mundane exposition dumps. They are subject to poor writing, and they never do stand out. This is a harem so there is no real reason why I should be expecting anything grandiose, but I do not want the same obnoxious scenes reiterated to me again and again.<br />
<br />
The latter half of DAL’s duration is a slight improvement, though the way it is introduced is incredibly sudden. Origami runs into one of the antagonists, and after a brief discussion she joins them; this all happens in the span of a few minutes. The events that occur later on retain some of my attention since we finally get some character development after almost half a season being spent on that pointless Natsumi arc. The date with Origami is also pretty cute and funny, so there is that as well. With that said, Origami’s arc has got to be the best in the series as of yet, though that is really not saying much when looking back on it now.<br />
<br />
Ironically enough, I could not take the show seriously because of its drastic tonal shifts. Five minutes of serious melodies, and then five minutes later, it transitions into goofy musical cues. The comedy, or comedic relief for that matter, is not that funny. The feeble attempts at melodrama are cringe-inducing, especially when Shido is at the forefront of it all, blasting out his usual quotes left and right.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Shido, he is back with his stubborn, whiny attitude. Honestly, it makes me want to tear my skin out whenever he screams into my ears. It literally takes up half of his dialogue. If he actually thought rationally, this whole season would have been over in five episodes. He jumps headfirst into the middle of a warzone and attempts to persuade the spirits to stop fighting. Aside from being utterly banal, he is one of the stupidest harem protagonists I have ever seen, yet because of plot convenience, things always work out in his favor.<br />
<br />
The sound is lackluster and bland, even recycling some of the music from the previous seasons. The opening and ending tracks are painfully forgettable.<br />
<br />
The animation hits its lowest point in the series. It is baffling how it could manage to stay so average, even as the franchise switches between three different studios. J.C. Staff should have stepped up, but they unfortunately have not. Frequent low points are scattered throughout this season, where it nosedives in dull action and constantly still frames. It is a shame, really, since the character designs for each girl are unique and pretty to look at, but because of lazy animation, it was never able to fully shine. Compared to, say, Quintessential Quintuplets (another show this season), Date A Live looks painfully bland in comparison.<br />
<br />
The third season of Date A Live is empty, devoid of any significant standing and personality. This addition tries to incorporate a story and attempts to take itself seriously, however this proves fruitless as it manages to be riddled with lazy writing, rapid pacing, dull characters, and lukewarm animation. Even for long-time fans - as a harem and for whatever its so-called “plot” is worth - this is average at best. I am disappointed.

    BIG SPOILERS AHEAD FOR NON-LIGHT NOVEL READERS.<br />
<br />
I liked the concept of Date A Live with the fact of it being a harem, it does not affect the story and the developments made by each character. As for the third season, I can say that this might be the biggest event in the entire Date A Live franchise since it will cover the volumes 8 to 12, I think and they will probably cover the climax of the story next season by starting of the introduction of a new spirit and ends with the Mio arc.<br />
As far as the story is a concern, this season will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302164">
        be the rising action of the story as it proceeds with the climax. For art, it is a good one but not as good as the past seasons. Nevertheless, it is still watchable in terms of art.<br />
As a conclusion, as far as the series goes, it is a good watch especially if you are looking for an exciting story full of surprises. Maybe the biggest surprise we might get in the future is seeing Reine finally takes her sleep for her eyebags are still showing from this season.

    DAL has 350k followers on MAL <br />
DAL II has 200k<br />
DAL II has 50k <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a reason for that trend. Ever since the middle of DAL the quality of the storytelling has been going down hill. Now even the art is going down hill. They aren&#039;t even bothering to do half hearted attempts at doing the details.<br />
<br />
<br />
The music while manipulative which had been holding up well with some real nice orchestral pieces  that were well selected to go with particular scenes have been replaced with more generic pieces. <br />
<br />
Voice acting which had been a real high point is now suffering not so much with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326674">
        main characters. But the secondary characters and different versions of the main characters are just jarringly badly done. If an actor can&#039;t do a childish voice, don&#039;t use them to play a child. The dissonance is like chalk on a blackboard. <br />
<br />
The writing has gotten even lazier. There&#039;s now seven potential deus ex machina in Shidou&#039;s harem. It&#039;s a situation that can be hard to handle for any writer and it isn&#039;t handled well here. In the last season you had their powers pretty much available or unavailable at whim, whatever the author thinks makes the poignant scene all without consideration of anything that&#039;s been established.  Good example, when the series was in comedy parody mode in the first season, we get the gag of 14 year old Kotori being the commander of the forces dealing with the spirits. Next season she is vowing &quot;That she will kill her beloved big brother if needed over his ability to summon an angel&quot;, this is ignoring the fact that she is capable of manifesting an angel and does so. Tanya the evil pulls this off, when DAL stopped going for comedy, their ability to sustain this stopped as well. <br />
<br />
The lazyness extends to the characters. They are just as smart or stupid as they need to be at any given moment with no regard to what they may or not have done in the past 5 minutes. The suddenly remember they have abilities, they fail to notice things that are both blindingly obvious and in positions impossible to ignore.  There is one example that is so blindingly stupid it will have you asking &quot;WHY IN THE HELL HASN&quot;T HE DONE THIS ALL THE WHILE UP TO NOW ??&quot; and then you may want to punch your TV<br />
<br />
In short. If you liked the first season of DAL, everything you liked in it is gone.<br />
The clever comedy<br />
The exploding of tropes. <br />
The fun characters.<br />
With the exception of Kurumi who may well be best girl now<br />
<br />

    Date a Live III is a worthwhile watch for fans of the franchise, but one could write a short story about its flaws.<br />
<br />
The first arc that introduces a new spirit is quite consistent and balances the humorous elements and drama well, but you get the feeling that compared to previous seasons the storytelling is getting bogged down by the bloating harem. Each spirit get their due screentime, but the interactions are quite uninspired and simply draw on what has been already established. <br />
<br />
Once we move to the main arc that lasts until the second to last episode the real pain starts. Origami is probably 50%

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305767">
        of the reason I fell in love with this franchise. On one hand I was glad to have her character developed and backstory explored, but on the other I did not like how they broke and altered her established character on more than one occasion. <br />
<br />
The plot is full of distractions and dead ends: An anti-spirit corporation gets significant screentime, but in the end those characters were only made to move the plot along to the next chapter, and are dropped out of the picture almost immediately without any closure. Similar things happen with Kurumi, who makes her appearance during the second half the show. We know what she does and how she does it, but we really don&#039;t know why, rendering her a text book example Deus ex machina. A mysterious entity whose powers and motivations are the key to understanding the cause for pretty much the entire plot is first introduced, then simply moved aside and forgotten.<br />
<br />
The basic storytelling structure is something like this: first introduce characters, build up intrigue and hype, then suddenly shift focus and scramble together a bare minimum of plot devices and rush into an unsatisfying climax. <br />
<br />
There is so much to bitch about the story and narrative, but somehow the humorous moments and the fanservice are enough to salvage this season. My real regret is this wasn&#039;t an actual hentai instead, but I can make due with what we got.

    Ok this review will go into spoiler territory but I have to write after looking at other reviews. Date Alive is a harem romcom with elements that you would automatically expect from a harem. Not to mention this is the third season of a beloved series that started back in 2013. After watching the first two seasons you start to grow more attached to every character which is exactly how I felt coming back to this show after 2015 from the movie adaptation. Now here are some things that other reviews are saying but missing the point. <br />
<br />
Story: Yes, I won&#039;t lie things are rushed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305004">
        and squished to try and adapt on screen while other plot points are given much development, other points aren&#039;t so adapted. Origami and Natsumi got the special treatment this time around but Shido got the short stick as well as Kurumi but the way I see it as being an anime only fan that just gives more fuel to want another season to develop those characters even more. However, looking at other stories from other harem anime it&#039;s not hard to tell the similarities ,but Date Alive continues to try and do new things that are either too old or overused and build upon that. While continuing to expand the story of a boy going on dates with spirits that are girls and tries to win them over. Simple yet ridiculous plot. And I love it for that reason. <br />
<br />
Art: I&#039;ve seen shows like Violet Evergarden that take animation to the next level and then there are &quot;shows&quot; that look like they were made in 1980 which is fine but considering it&#039;s 2019 then it&#039;s a bit disheartening. The comparison between this and old seasons is staggering but not disheartening and while I agree it could have been better do try to look past that and just have an enjoyable time with the story and characters we all love.<br />
<br />
Overall, I may just be rambling about parts other reviewers are criticizing but I&#039;m just grateful that another season of my favorite anime has been animated. Now comes the difficult part of waiting to see how sales and numbers will do to continue this series. Hopefully there is some news about whether or not there will be another season and when it will begin to be talked about. I just hope that it is possible within the next 2-3 years since Season 2 was in 2014 and the movie in 2015. <br />

    I honestly come to the 3rd season of Date a Live without any high expectation at all, and it&#039;s even filled because of how the natsumi arc (first 5 episodes iirc?) was kind of, I dunno, stagnant? and also how JC Staff butcher the art at the arc that keep myself laughing and thought &quot;LMAO THEY KEEP BUTCHERING THIS SEASON&#039;S ART&quot; <br />
<br />
But once it come to the Tenguu City, 5 Years Ago arc, everything&#039;s started to going really interesting. Not only story-wise, but art-wise too (The qualities back to how it was in the first 2 seasons). They told the mysteries that&#039;s been surrounding the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304288">
        past 2 seasons in a very exciting way that you just can&#039;t help but think &quot;HOREE SHITTO&quot; in your heart at every new revelations. <br />
<br />
My only advice here, if you don&#039;t like how Natsumi Arc looks like, try to watch the Tenguu City 5 years ago arc in the least, especially if you&#039;re a long-time fans of the series.

    Hi, I&#039;m a professional 2D animator myself writing my first review here. There will be no spoilers in this review, feel free to read my frustrations as someone who genuinely loves this anime, and is an expert in production. I am rating this season harshly because I know how the industry works, and that this gem did not get the justice it deserved.<br />
<br />
As someone who doesn&#039;t usually watch Harem animes, Date A Live season lll couldn&#039;t have been more pathetic and done wrong by J.C. Staff. Especially as an artist. I was very excited by the story and art direction of the first 2 seasons

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355200">
        done by other studios only to be frustrated and deeply saddened by the half-hearted efforts for this potentially amazing season. But of course, due to the nature of the industry, the producers and management will always take the cheapest studio they can get for mass-production. Showing no love towards the viewers and treating fans with very little respect for rare hidden gems like Date A Live in such an already crappy anime market.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (6/10):<br />
It goes without saying, that the story is automatically amazing. But that&#039;s the author, not the studio. The story alone can&#039;t carry J.C. Staff&#039;s half-assed efforts. And especially when you turn what is an amazing storywriting arc into a single half-assed final episode, you butcher what could have made the viewers cry with excitement. Instead we got some cringe ass anime main character with the typical cringe red eye, black face crap.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, it&#039;s evident from the first episode immediately how butchered the drama aspect is. They half-heartedly attempt to create &quot;fear&quot; or &quot;intense&quot; atmosphere that it comes off as cringe or a typical anime crap. When it&#039;s predecessor seasons really nail emotions and getting the audience to feel for the characters and feel anxiety/excitement.<br />
<br />
Art (1/10):<br />
This was just disastrous, while sure I can admit certain important scenes they actually tried. The majority of the anime&#039;s art direction pales in comparison to their previous seasons. A lot of frames you can tell were done within a minute, no details. No perspective. The cranium in a lot of their heads were even missing.<br />
<br />
The opening itself, was entirely just stillframes with flowing hair. They clearly showed no love to the fanbase and expected them to just be ignorant and love it anyway. But no, not to real anime lovers. But again, I understand big studios and shit pay in Japan leads to mass production and little care for the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound (5/10):<br />
It&#039;s a given that the voice actors from the original seasons would already be great and carrying the series along w/ the amazing storywriters. But they can&#039;t carry J.C. Staff entirely alone with that. <br />
<br />
Character (5/10):<br />
As you&#039;ve noticed, I&#039;m going to again, say it&#039;s a given the characters and their development are automatically going to be great due to the amazing writer. HOWEVER, animation-wise, if you&#039;ve watched the other seasons, you can tell that the characters this season are animated completely out of character with their established archetypes because J.C. Staff failed to pay attention to leading their animators for correct acting choices. It&#039;s obvious they only took on the project because it was famous and for profit. <br />
<br />
The characters this season came off more as basic stereotypes, or say emotionless characters like Origami were too active w/ their movements or their posing was way too out of character because of the lack of attention to detail from the animation team and director.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (3/10):<br />
While some moments were enjoyable, due to the nature of how the adaptation made plot twists so darn obvious, I couldn&#039;t help but sit there going like well we obviously know what&#039;s coming up, but they would attempt to make the main character stupid and not foresee the obvious to take place in 10 minutes. They treated the viewers as if we were children and spoonfed too much information ruining many buildup and dramatic moments. The camera angles being mild as well during important scenes just straight up kills the excitement or buildup.<br />
<br />
The worst part is they straight up gave us a slideshow many times on dramatic scenes, and you can&#039;t hope but wonder if as a fan, you were just blue-balled and taken for granted. Personally, I feel they treated this amazing show as just another trash income source, which is unfortunately displeasing, but another factor of the industry.<br />
<br />
Overall (4.5/10):<br />
Obviously I could have rated this higher, but I&#039;m rating this based on how the studio handled the adaptation with very poor effort to please the loyalty of the fanbase. The story and voice acting being great is a given, and therefore can&#039;t offput the poor excuse of a show this season was. You also can&#039;t balance out one good scene with an entire season of trash effort expecting the fanbase to be pleased.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
That concludes my review, thank you if you&#039;ve given a quick read or if you relate with my frustrations. Feel free to hit me up if our interests align. I personally love anime with real plot and effort, and wish to make my own eventually. Nowadays it&#039;s hard to find any of that due to the mass-production of trash and hiring random artists to animate, the industry is failing miserably and not doing themselves a favour in how the world views anime due to this and many factors.
