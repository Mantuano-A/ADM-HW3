    PLOT:<br />
Here&#039;s to the new adventures where Inaba decides to move into an apartment where it contains various youkais. (Typically a lot of people would back out from it... but with him, it becomes very entertaining and he will never be bored). While he gets to settle into the new apartment... he gets to meet his neighbours and various characters throughout the series. Overtime, Inaba gets to unlock another side of him that contains his spirituality powers. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: <br />
Inaba: New resident in the Youkai apartment, high school student, kind, &amp; caring.<br />
Akane: Inaba&#039;s friend and neighbour, spiritualist, funny, outgoing, powerful, and kind.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
This is one of my favourite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271184">
        top 5 animes in 2017. It is very refreshing to know that this anime contains 26 episodes. It gives us time to get to know the main and various characters that live in and outside of the Youkai apartment. It also contains comedic and [occasionally] dramatic moments. The vibes that I&#039;ve seen in the anime is that everyone in the Youkai apartment is a FAMILY! They all have a role in their own way that helps bring the anime and chemistry of the characters together. Whenever there is a big event happening in the apartment... everyone gets to come together and have a great time. No one will ever be bored. <br />
<br />
IMPROVEMENTS?<br />
BUT, if I had to critique it, I would have love to see some of the other characters get more screen time to see their origins respectfully. <br />
Plus, some more scenes and adventures outside of the apartment and school would be nice too.

    This show needs more attention, I can&#039;t believe that people here in MAL rated this show very low and in fact this is probably one of the best show this season. <br />
<br />
Youkai shows like this are very rare. As of now, I watched the first 5 episode and it blew my freaking expectations.<br />
<br />
By far the show showcases <br />
<br />
- great introduction<br />
- great characters<br />
- very good main male character<br />
- very interesting backstories<br />
- explaining some of the hidden elements of the series<br />
- great opening and ending themes<br />
- and great voice actors<br />
<br />
For now, Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou is a very decent show that executes every category very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254490">
        very well. Characters are adorable and the main character is very relatable for other people. Simple story with complicated characters yet so fun to watch. Other people might think this show only showcases pure comedy, but it gets very very dark sometimes when they show detailed backstories of the supporting characters. This show must be on the top of the charts, Having the overall score below 7 is unforgivable, this show needs more attention. This is definitely one of the highlights of this season. <br />
<br />
(Don&#039;t ever skip this show, you&#039;ll regret it later)<br />

    For some reason my review was removed, when all I did was update my thoughts. So I&#039;ll just add only the newer version of my review.<br />
<br />
If anything, the episode of the Moon Viewing Night unexpectedly hit me with some serious feels, and I actually teared up a bit. This anime really ponders life hard, and makes you think about how we interact with other people. <br />
<br />
**Art - I&#039;m giving this 8/10 because it isn&#039;t on a high budget movie level, though I feel this helps me focus more on the story and character development.<br />
<br />
**Story - I feel that this is well balanced. It doesn&#039;t drag

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293597">
        on or dwell on trivial matters. I haven&#039;t felt like I&#039;ve seen fillers, and I hope I never do.<br />
<br />
** I&#039;m not sure what to say about &quot;sound,&quot; other than that I feel like the music, voice, and sound effect levels are on point. One doesn&#039;t over power the other, and I believe that special effects come in at the right moment.<br />
<br />
** Character writing and development are well balanced. In 12 episodes we see the main character grow up. For him, months pass, but it doesn&#039;t feel rushed on the viewer&#039;s end. When he learns lessons, we get to see him contemplate what he&#039;s learned. We get to see a mature, thoughtful teenager who&#039;s open to learning more about life, and ironically does so by meeting spirits and ghosts.<br />
<br />
**Overall, this has been a great series so far. I&#039;m giving 8/10 overall, but I feel comfortable doing that with this anime. I believe this anime fits the kind of person I am, because when things get too serious, I want to lighten the mood. It&#039;s as if characters take the initiative to balance out how dark and serious things get by breaking out the meat and sake. :P

    When I think of how best to summarize Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou I think it’s like a student&#039;s passion project. Its heart is in the right place and it&#039;s trying its best to make the audience happy. Although it may be a bit on the amateurish side and it’s clumsily made, it’s so endearing in its struggle that you can’t help but cheer it along regardless.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
It’s slice of life so there&#039;s no major overarching plot. In the first half of the show, the main character Inaba goes to the wonderful Youkai Apartment and we meet all of the fanciful inhabitants. Most episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266443">
        take place within the apartment, at Inaba’s high school, or in the town he lives in. From his new roommates, he learns that about the good and bad ghosts that inhabited his world all his life. This structure is used through most episodes of the first half of the show; Inaba encounters an evil ghost, exorcises it, then offers a life lesson to close off the chapter. Many of the lessons are what you’d expect to hear from parents or teachers, but they’re the kind of lessons anyone should be taught at least while they’re growing up. Some of the morals were; do right by others, respect your elders, always be polite when you’re a guest, so on and so forth.<br />
While the lessons sometimes feel a bit forced into the show, they always do a great job of forming the main characters into role models as the is value in their words. Even if the characters come off a bit heavy-handed that’s part of their charm I suppose. <br />
<br />
There are only minor side stories that compiled together take up most of the screen time in the later episodes. After one minor plot thread is resolved a new one appears. One pretty big disappointment with the story is that the supernatural element becomes little more than an afterthought during the second half of the show. I really started to wonder if that “Youkai” in the title was really justified at all given how infrequently it was utilized by the show. The whole second half of the show felt overall very unnecessary. While there’s still a lot to enjoy, focusing on the Inaba’s classmates was a mistake. It totally wasted the far more interesting residents of the Youkai Apartment. <br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
Your enjoyment of this show depends on how much you like the characters. Some of them have enough charm and charisma to keep you entertained while their on screen, but others just blend together due to a lack of defining traits. Nothing much really happens to the characters after 26 episodes. Looking back on the experience, for all the life lessons they preach we learn very little about the cast and they don’t grow or change in ways to make them believable as people. Many of the residents of the Youkai were still being depicted as lead characters by the end, with close-ups and all, yet I couldn’t for the life of me remember their names or why they’re special enough to deserve individual screen time. <br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
The animation isn&#039;t outstanding because there isn’t a whole lot of it. Thanks to solid directing, I was always able to understand what was occurring in scenes. The Yokai Apartment is well designed so you understand where scenes take place in reference to the room layout. Each character has a simple design, at first they may look generic but they’re given life through well-defined personalities and enough chances to show their varied expressions.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
An upbeat opening prepares the viewer for an easygoing 20 minutes; the soundtrack that backs most scenes is really peppy and rhythmic. While it&#039;s not the most complex scores I’ve heard, it does a great job at setting the atmosphere and always feels appropriately used. Amateurish voice acting, hilarious engrish. The main character is in the Engrish Club so you better get used to hearing the actors struggle through their English lines (because it never gets better).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
It&#039;s melodramatic at times, but its uplifting tone prevents the drama from becoming overwrought. Sometimes I found the long scenes (in the second half) of characters conversing boring because the topics wouldn’t interest me. Those conversations add very little to the characters so it was inevitable I would lose track of who’s who. Also, there’s a ton of fujobait in this show, not that I&#039;m complaining, it actually made the whole thing way funnier and feel self-aware.<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 5.6/10<br />
Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou is a surprisingly lively ghost story that is content with its simplicity, occasionally it steps out of its comfort zone with varying degrees of success. Despite its flaws, it is uplifting enough to be watchable. I feel like I may have harped on it a bit too hard because it’s clearly not a show with a high budget. However, it is asking a lot of the audience to devout around 10 hours in total to it. 26 full-length episodes was definitely longer than it needed to be. I feel kind of bad for being so hard on the underdog, but even as when I went into it with underdog level expectations it’s still far from being great.

    For me it was a very relaxing anime to watch when compared to my typical bloody, action packed, and/or strange anime that I enjoy. <br />
<br />
I recommend this one to people that enjoy thinking about psychology and sociology. The show is focused on speaking about and showcasing aspects of the human mind. A great watch. Now, I&#039;m going to watch some bloody anime lol. Geez they want my review even longer? Why is that, the show was good and all i have left to talk about are spoilers. Even longer? So the main character is often hinted at being gay which was very humorous to me.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267246">
        The show gave me a lot of laughs.

    *This is my first time writing a review for an ongoing series so bear with me. <br />
<br />
6.73? Seriously? I mean this anime is not bad at all. This series deserves at least a 7 or even higher. *Deep breath* Okay here are a few questions to ask yourself if you want to see if this series is suitable for you:<br />
<br />
1. Do you enjoy relaxing anime series?<br />
2. Are you the type of person who likes character development?<br />
3. Do you like supernatural genre (like ghost)?<br />
<br />
If your answer to the above questions is mostly yes, then you need to give this a try. Since there is a synopsis

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254129">
        already, I will skip directly to the characters and the plot. The characters are actually quite likable. Each of the residents at the apartment have very unique past and personalities, which helps to make the whole series more interesting. The main protagonist initially was freaked out by all the residents at the apartment (because most of them are ghosts) and gradually opened up to them. There is also some development (in terms of personality) for the main protagonist as the series progresses (at this point episode 4 for me). Some may say that there are way too many characters in the series, but in my opinion, all these characters are vital to this whole series. Each of them contributes part by part and they are more or less like the base for this whole series.<br />
<br />
The plot is a pretty simple slice of life plot, with acceptable pace. Basically it is about how the main protagonist interacts with the residents at the apartment and slowly get close to them. It is not a series with twists or exciting climaxes, but interactions with the residents at the apartment and the personal growth of the main protagonist are enough to make this series interesting.<br />
<br />
For arts and sound, it is above average. The animation can obviously be better in a lot of ways, like the backgrounds can be drawn a bit more detailed. Though I guess it is okay. Not much worth noticing for music. The music used doesn&#039;t clash with the scenes.<br />
<br />
To summarise, I enjoyed this series quite a lot because it is relaxing to watch and the character + development is interesting enough for me to keep on watching. I like how all of the residents at the apartment is like a big family, where they support each other when they need help.  <br />
<br />
I hope my review can somehow help you in choosing to watch this series or not. Please feel free to give me some feedbacks. Thanks for reading this review written by an amateur :)<br />
<br />
*I may end up not updating this review after this series end.

    When I sat down and took a look at the offerings for the Summer anime line-up, Elegant Yōkai Apartment Life seemed like it would have plenty of potential to be a feel-good type of show. While I was hoping that it would be reminiscent of Natsume’s Book of Friends, I always remained realistic in the sense that it wouldn’t be quite as extraordinary as Natsume’s. However… I never anticipated that the show would turn into a colossal and incoherent waste of my time.<br />
<br />
The series revolves around a kid named Inaba Yūshi. After his parents die, he moves in with his Uncle. But feeling like a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259346">
        huge burden to them, he decides that when it’s time to go to high school, he’s going to move into the school’s dorm to make life easier for his family. As middle-school graduation approaches and he prepares to make the big move, the dorm that Inaba originally planned to shift into ends up burning down. Desperate to find a place to crash for the next six months as the dorm’s rebuilt, Inaba exhausts all avenues available to him, until one evening a mysterious looking kid offers him a suggestion. This leads to Inaba finding residence in a room within an old and gloomy looking house that turns out to be the home of numerous kinds of yōkai, or supernatural creatures and people.<br />
<br />
My first impression of the anime was that it felt a bit unoriginal to me, but there were charming characters and some minor plot development that had me intrigued. My biggest question after sitting down and watching thirteen episodes of this is: what the hell happened to those characters and where did the plot go?<br />
<br />
The first couple of episodes for the series, shows us Inaba as he moves into the apartment and begins to get situated with the yōkai occupants of his new residence. The humour was awkward and sometimes a bit forced, but the different supernatural characters with their anecdotes on life felt genuine and feel-good; exactly what I was hoping for. Yet, regardless of this small fluffy quality, the show is laced with predictable tropes, one right after another.<br />
<br />
Upon living at the haunted apartment, he moves into the school dorm when its finished. But soon after moving out, Inaba misses the camaraderie and homey atmosphere that came with living with the yōkai. Predictable. When an altercation with some schoolmates occurs, he realises what he gave up and moves back. Predictable. There are many more instances of it. My excitement plummeted very quickly, being replaced with boredom. <br />
<br />
In spite of being unimaginative and boring, that wasn’t where the show went wrong. Early in the series there is a vague mentioning of the main character having supernatural abilities, which piqued my interest even more. I felt that it would offer more depth to the seemingly straightforward and somewhat bland nature of the story. But aside from a quick reference to it at the end of an episode, we don’t see anything else pertaining to his “abilities” until four or five episodes later. This is where shit starts to hit the fan.<br />
<br />
For the sake of not giving any major spoilers, all I can really say is that the anime begins to severely deviate from the original concept into a whole other type of story. Instead of it being about a guy living with yōkai and learning from them, growing and maturing as an individual, it ends up being some kid who now has to learn to train and manage powers that have manifested out of nowhere. The yōkai turn into more of a background atmosphere than anything else. The transition from point A to point B was jarring, unexpected, painfully forced, and utterly terrible.<br />
<br />
The climax that arises as a contrast to Inaba’s fresh powers was horribly written and entangled in disjointed storytelling. While I was watching, I honestly felt as if each episode was written on the fly without much thought or consideration for the overall narrative at all; as if the writers themselves didn’t quite understand or know what they wanted to do with the anime.<br />
<br />
I mentioned earlier that we had charming characters. As Inaba struggles with his abilities and what he’s supposed to do with them, these charming characters are only seen a handful of times. Whenever they are shown, I will admit, were the moments that I found most pleasant. Their humour and on-screen presence was much more gratifying than dealing with Inaba.<br />
<br />
Another facet that annoyed me immensely was the pointless scene where Inaba’s cousin drops by to visit him. It’s pretty obvious from the first episode that his uncle’s family feel Inaba is somewhat of a burden to them. His female cousin is always depicted with having a mean, sour attitude. Nonetheless, one afternoon she hunts him down and has a breakdown about how Inaba doesn’t visit the family any more and about how she’s always cared for him. This scene doesn’t trigger or address anything else in the series up to the present episode. I don’t know if it will be addressed later, but it was a complete and total useless scene that had absolutely nothing to do with narrative. I felt (only slightly) that it’s a set-up for a future romance, however, Inaba has another person who’s quite open about them possibly being a couple. Did I mention that this scene came out of nowhere with no context to it whatsoever?<br />
<br />
After watching episode 13, and seeing that the series would be continuing onwards through the Autumn season, I decided to drop it. I wasn’t enjoying it and found myself to be wholeheartedly frustrated with everything that was going on. I suspect Elegant Yōkai Apartment Life is the reason I fell into an anime slump to begin with.<br />
<br />
Aside from the writing, the animation quality was pretty decent during the first half of the season. There wasn’t anything extravagant or special about it, but it was aesthetically pleasing enough and consistent. Yet as more episodes released, I noticed a significant dip in the details of the artwork. Characters had uneven eyes, certain design details would be missing from one scene to the next–it all took on a seemingly rushed appeal that made it even more challenging to enjoy.<br />
<br />
One of the main reasons I don’t watch as much anime as  I used to is because the severe lack of originality makes it difficult for me enjoy many titles. I have been learning to appreciate certain tropes when utilised with unique traits, because I know that some tropes are worth watching. It also keeps me engaged with the medium, which is what I really hoped for with Elegant Yōkai Apartment Life. But alas, it just didn’t happen. Storytelling-wise this was one of the worst damn shows. Granted I didn’t watch too many simulcasts during Summer, but trust me… it goes from zero to what-the-fuck very quickly.<br />

    Overall this show feels weirdly incoherent and not sure what it&#039;s trying to be - you&#039;d think from the title it&#039;d focus on the youkai inhabitants of the apartments but in the first 12 episodes only one inseparable pair of the youkai are given a full episode dedicated to their story. In fact, of the 5 youkai that appear in more than 1 episode with any role, 3 are unable to talk and 1 can only say &quot;welcome back&quot;. <br />
<br />
On its own that&#039;s just misleading given the title of the series but the problem is the character work is poor and the plots and emotional

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301996">
        arc are a bit of a mess. I guess the closest thing to a theme of a series is the main character&#039;s maturation but the problem is we never really see him changing - he makes references to how he was &quot;before&quot; yet we&#039;re never given a glimpse of how he lived before moving out from his adopted family past their existence so there&#039;s no sense of development. At the same time, regardless of what he says he often behaves in weird exaggerated ways that don&#039;t match the morals he&#039;s supposedly learning. It&#039;s not clear what he wants either. <br />
<br />
The other characters are also given very little development - even though a few human characters appear in almost every episode, there&#039;s not really much difference between most of them. One is hotheaded, one has an impressive aura, but most of the lines could come from any of them. Lots of talking seemingly &quot;deep&quot; things that aren&#039;t particularly profound. We don&#039;t really get a sense of their lives or anything either. <br />
<br />
The plots are... flimsy. Within a day of watching the first 13 episodes I could only remember a couple of them. The last 3 of the first 13 episodes form a particular mini plot arc but it&#039;s extremely full of tedious filler dialogue and plot to pad out something that turns out unexciting. One episode is mostly taken up by &quot;researching&quot; whether something is possible that they literally just witnessed happen. There&#039;s no real excitement or emotional resonance except in one early episode because the characters are so thin and nothing much happens.<br />
<br />
One weird thing I noticed a few times is extreme emotional whiplash - the series is pretty lighthearted but there are a few flashbacks to stories of violent murders and then near instant return to lightheartedness. <br />
<br />
<br />
In the second half and the problems are basically the same. The youkai play very little role, which is a shame as the designs are cute. The second series revolves around school life but again the new characters are mostly weak and the series long arc around what could vaguely be described as the &quot;antagonist&quot; school characters is really really poor with very little development and with an unbelievably weak resolution. I complained about the moral messages in the first half but there were a few really awful ones here and some that contradicted themselves - early on there&#039;s a &quot;don&#039;t judge people before knowing their whole story&quot; moral *right next* to the same characters making up a whole story for another character and being very judgemental based on a single negative experience and their tastes in art! Overall the series felt like it wasted potential with a few real plot and dialogue clangers. I just wanted more youkai, mostly.<br />

    Well, slice-of life in the apartment with the good ghosts and stuff like that... well... i kinda missed the point to be fair.<br />
<br />
Character developement practicaly didnt happend, and overall it felt, like the story is not moving in any direction, which didnt actualy happend even in the final episode in my opinion.<br />
 <br />
If I was to say, that this show felt plain as the chest of the loli character, i would be praising it. <br />
Still, the animation was nice and there wasnt any unbearable fanservise included, so it was at least watchable.<br />
<br />
In comparation with the Magetsukan Kitan (manga with the similar story) I must say

    MAL doesn&#039;t detail how many episodes this show will have but after the twelfth I felt comfortable enough that I&#039;d seen all this show has to offer. Due to such, and the biased reviews submitted so far about this anime, I thought I would go a step further than leaving a bad rating and jot down why it&#039;s not a very good anime.<br />
<br />
Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou on paper seems like a promising anime, and it should have been; however, the execution of what is probably good source material, dropped the ball.<br />
<br />
Art; The style used for this anime looks dated when compared to other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258192">
        modern day animes, although I feel that the animation in this case sets up an appropriate aesthetic - 8/10 (Very Good)<br />
<br />
Sound; With an op song that scores on the better side of those for the season, this anime&#039;s other sounds and music range from average to good - 7/10 (Good)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment; The main focus on this anime for episodes 2-9 is a causal life and simply enjoying the small things (health, friends/family, etc.). This causes the viewer, if they stick it out until at least episode 5, to come to smile at the residents of the Youkai Apartments when they have a party or simply enjoy a good meal. 7/10 (Good)<br />
<br />
Characters; While some of the characters for this show are unique (our MC included), all but the MC are one dimensional and do not show other sides to their characters. This one dimension for everyone else can be accepted if done well; however, by the last episode of the show I felt that the grin that I had on my face for the first episode, had slowly changed into a grimace. Some of this is played off as the Youkai and other residents of the apartments being slow to change or steadfast in their ways. Nonetheless, by the third and fourth time seeing the same characters saying and doing the exact same trope things, I was bored. 6/10 (Fair)<br />
<br />
*WARNING; With the story evaluation, I&#039;ll be getting into spoilers in regards to how the show is structured and generalities of the three main arcs present. I will not get into exact details but to evaluate things, I will have to explain where the show&#039;s major flaws are found.<br />
<br />
<br />
*BEGIN MINOR SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
Story; Oh boy. Where to start...well let&#039;s begin with the show&#039;s pacing. Being the simpleton I am, I honestly didn&#039;t notice the off-pacing until sometime between the end of episode 3 and five minutes into episode 4. At that point, I literally thought to myself, &quot;Really? Why are we even doing this? I thought we had gotten past this point.&quot; But no, no. We must have two more episodes closing this arc before we can move forward. Now I get that residents of the Youkai Apartments were designed to give off a &quot;relaxed&quot; feeling while our MC gives off the &quot;I want to hurry up and grow up&quot; feeling. But why were 5 episodes devoted to this when it could have been handled in 2-3, I&#039;m not sure.<br />
<br />
Episodes 6 to 8 cover what let&#039;s call the &quot;training-arc&quot; where our MC becomes more and more immersed in a world involving Yokai and the various humans that live at the apartments. The biggest problem with this arc, is that there is no motivation for this change in our MC other than &quot;Well this seems interesting and I guess it comes with living here.&quot; There was no other agency present for our MC and for what I just expained it is done weakly - it&#039;s not well presented nor developed properly. Furthermore, the training that the MC goes through is minimal at best and does little to any good during the third arc. This is very surprising given the introductions and time spent on the other residents of the apartments who employ much more complicated techniques and practices right in front of the MC. Granted, this show would not have benefited from a training montage; however, even if this arc was structured in a way where it was simply an episode for each instructor, this would have been much better than the arc presented.<br />
<br />
The third arc entails episodes 9 to 12 and despite this being the &quot;conflict&quot; or &quot;skills put to the test arc&quot;, there is hardly any of this present. This arc mainly consists of episodes where for each of them; our MC bumbles his way through things, somehow things are resolved for now, he asks around the apartments for advice or help but all the other residents either brush him off or are simply MIA, and repeat. Normally, this is the time for our MC in most stories to learn from his mistakes and employ new tactics, techniques, or strategies however none of these happen.  It is not until episode 12 when a sensei from the apartments finally shows up to wipe the floor with our &#039;bad guy&#039; and the MC is left their standing saying, &quot;Man, they sure are strong.&quot; Things don&#039;t end there though as our MC encounters the &#039;bad guy&#039; one last time by himself and bumbles his way through this encounter without showing any improvement. The show literally ends with our MC running away into the sunset promising himself that he&#039;ll eventually straighten out the mess left from this conflict.<br />
<br />
The structure of the story into these three arcs: exposition, training, and conflict is interesting but ultimately is poorly executed to the point where they could be relabeled: &quot;boring drawn out intro&quot;, &quot;Why am I doing this? And you call this training?&quot;, and &quot;half-baked hero gets it handed to him day-in-day-out&quot;. 3/10 (Poor)<br />
<br />
<br />
*END SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
Overall; The show has good art, music, and setting but one dimensional characters and a poorly executed story. It&#039;s almost as if the production team was either given very strict instructions for following a bad story or they ruined a good one with bad pacing and screenwriting equal to that of a third grader. 4/10

    Created a MAL account just to review this anime because it&#039;s too underrated! Honestly wondering if those that gave it less than 7 have even tried watching a few more eps. Only downside for me is the opening track and somewhat redundant &quot;thinking out loud&quot; moments by MC Yushi. <br />
<br />
Firstly, the plot is interesting yet not too theoretical - personally, I feel that this is very crucial considering that a lot of an anime&#039;s intended meaning can be loss in translation and turn out gibberish. The episodes are also coherent and I like how each episode isn&#039;t ended on an abrupt note while keeping you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264240">
        hooked. The pace in which the plot unfolds is brilliant. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the characters are well-drawn (could be a personal preference) and there&#039;s ample humour that&#039;s injected into the series. Kudos to the producers for keeping the anime light-hearted yet at times being able to induce feelings of empathy/sadness for the characters.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, the characters are well-developed: you&#039;re given enough background that&#039;s needed to appreciate the flow of the anime. Again, this is an important aspect as some animes tend to go overboard and spend too much time in developing certain characters even though it doesn&#039;t value add to the anime. <br />
<br />
tl;dr this anime defo deserves a watch and a 2nd season!

    i sought out this site to purposely add my review of this particular anime.  Like most viewers, I found the initial episodes to be fairly interesting in addition to a great soundtrack.  However 18 episodes later (SPOILER ALERT!), my enthusiasm has waned considerably.  <br />
<br />
The artistry whilst colourful has remained fairly stagnant with forgettable new characters all sporting the same elongated facial shapes just with different hairstyles and colours.  <br />
<br />
Character development and the yokai premise of the anime have also gone out the window at the expense of a bizarre plot direction towards episodic stand-alonish kinda PSA (Public Service Announcement ) story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262123">
        line : eg. violence towards women, workplace camaraderie, gangland participation etc.  <br />
<br />
Initially such goody 2 shoe plots would at least involve some kinda supernatural encounters but the latest episode (18) basically comes across as an insipid tale of &#039;how to communicate effectively in the workplace&#039; lazy plot line with nary a demon to be seen.   <br />
<br />
One can&#039;t help but think that this must be heavily subsidised by some kind of government agency to steer the plot towards teaching little kids about adapting to the real school/working life and promoting the moral adage that &#039;no man is an island&#039;.  Even the new opening and ending themes in the 2nd season can&#039;t save this driverless train wreck that it&#039;s determined to become.  <br />
<br />
I would have scored the early episodes of season 1 highly but the overall score has been heavily diluted by the failing scores I&#039;d awarded the 2nd season thus far.  <br />
<br />
If Doraemon can stealthily incorporate PSA messages into 30 odd years of wonderfully inspiring anime, I can&#039;t see why I have to waste any more time on this woefully inadequate anime without the namesake yokai doing much except decorating the title and the occasional public services performed.

    Where to start, It is one of the most involving  viewer of this season,<br />
I do not understand why people underrated  so much thi anime.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking this one is very enjoyable, with a very relaxing pace, which helps to know and remember all the characters that appears all over the episodes.<br />
<br />
I wont write much more than this as i&#039;m  pretty agreeing with most reviewers which gave 8 or more,only one thing i want to add i&#039;ts no like others tons of anime series whose are full of fanservice.<br />
<br />
Enjoy until the end, it deserves your time you won&#039;t regret it

    I feel like people underrate this show just because they watch the first episode and drop it immediately by just focusing too much on its budget quality art. Honestly, the quality of the visuals feel like they were made on budget, but if you can look past it, you will see that its a very chill, easygoing, and satisfying anime. <br />
<br />
The story is about Inaba Yuushi, who is starting high school and needs an apartment to stay in. He wounds up living in an apartment filled with supernatural creatures, and learns to get along with them. There doesnt seem like there is much to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255995">
        story at first, but it starts to develop as the anime progresses, exploring the characters and really making the protagonist grow as a person. <br />
<br />
Art is pretty average, its not like its terrible, but there is nothing outstanding about it. Its just sort of weak in comparison to alot of modern anime today (which is why i say its a budget quality anime), but hey, at least it isnt generic like animes that kinda slap in a moe style to their anime... <br />
<br />
There isnt anything that is really noticeable in the sound, which is good in my book, because it means that there are no weird interrupting sounds that ruin the experience. What is great though is the Opening, which literally gives you a good sense of what type of style the anime presents itself. Its just real chill and wholesome music, that puts you in a relaxing mood.<br />
<br />
The most notable thing about this show are the characters. They are all really welcoming characters, with a pure kindness at heart. The inhabitants of the apartment treat the main character like he is family, and that simple bond really brings the anime together. Also the main character is an important component to all of this, not like main characters in other animes that feel almost forgotten. Yuushi is our connection into the world, as his reactions to his experiences are ideally what the viewer would imagine if they were put into the situations. Yuushi has realistic concerns, but also an understanding personality to bring open-minded humane thinking into the show. <br />
<br />
I am currently on episode 8, and I feel as the anime is continuing in a positive direction. At first I wasnt sure if I liked the anime or not, but soon it definitely grew on me, and I am fully enjoying each episode, waiting on it each week. It really makes me want to read the manga, just so I can have my fill of it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I may be giving this anime too much credit, but I simply cant help but be a little biased in my review. I definitely think it deserves a higher rating than a lot of other animes on MAL, because 6.7 is too low for the content this anime provides. If I were to give an unbiased score, 7.5/10, but personally I think this anime deserves at least an 8/10.

    There will be always be a place for you - <br />
But a &#039;youkai&#039; apartment? What can you say? <br />
This anime is one of the anime-s out there are ignored even though its&#039; quality as an anime is considerably a top of the line among its batch. The story revolves  a high-school guy whom by coincidence or destiny lives in a apartment that is far from the &#039;normal&#039; that he wants. The opening song and the ending song are worth listening to; a nice bonus to its good story. The main character&#039;s interaction with different people and others are centerpiece of the story. One will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261335">
        appreciate this anime on its&#039; touch to the themes of friendship and bravery. In general, this anime is not recommended to be neglected in any corner. <br />
One can be elegant by adding to his or her &#039;everyday&#039; an episode of this anime. Good vibes will haunt you until its last episode.

    For something that initially seems like a pretty good mix of &quot;Natsume Yuujinchou&quot;, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, &quot;xxxHolic&quot;, and a splash of shonen and BL tropes with largely good art and at least two good songs, this really should not be as bad as it ultimately turned out to be after around... episode 5 or 6? Unfortunately, holding out hope that it&#039;s still good only makes the Baby Boomer garbled &#039;morals&#039; and other nonsense even worse as the series drags on.<br />
<br />
The first OP, &quot;Good Night Mare&quot; by Lozareena is really good. The 2nd ED, &quot;Nichijoshiki Broken Down&quot; by Abe Atsushi and Nakamura Yuichi is also pretty good.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286429">
        I&#039;m also really impressed with how much this series basically canonizes the romantic relationship between the male protagonist and his &#039;best friend&#039;. It&#039;s... I mean it&#039;s a thing that I still marvel at? Like even if you&#039;re not just desperate for something out of this to be okay it&#039;s so thrown in your face by basically every single character in the show... At times it seems like this is a shonen series written by someone who came off of a BL project. It&#039;s just very strange.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately... the plot. And at least some of the art. The art is by and large quite good. I say by and large because my respect for artistic ability dies when there&#039;s a character who exists solely for boob jiggle, even when she&#039;s not moving. And the. constant. pan. up. shots. Pan up shots for women are by and large insulting to start with - they tend to objectify women/female characters by focusing on their sexual characteristics over their personality and intelligence. The shot starts from the legs, moves over the crotch, then the boobs, and FINALLY gets to the face just about when the camera is done dealing with the character, so the audience is so focused on how sexy the woman is that they ignore what she&#039;s adding to the story or who she is as a person.<br />
<br />
These tend to be par for the course in shonen series, and as one of the tropes demonstrating the shonen leanings of the story, I was quite ready to eyeroll and ignore it as I am oft to do with these things. How else do you consume media these days? But for some ridiculous reason the series&#039; crew REALLY likes these shots? And uses them ALL THE TIME. For no apparent reason - not even &#039;fanservice&#039;, really. The second or third that caught my eye was when Akine returns later in episode 1. She does a plot thing, and then starts talking. The pan-up starts as she&#039;s talking. She&#039;s wearing a sweater. It doesn&#039;t emphasize her boobs or show her cleavage. She&#039;s not wearing pants that emphasize her crotch, and the shot starts from around her mid-thigh, not emphasizing most of her legs. Usually pan-up shots are used when female characters are first introduced in a story or when they change outfits and present themselves in their new clothes to others. This series goes one farther and uses these shots when female characters who have already been introduced and haven&#039;t changed clothes are just... present or just talking about plot. As if the crew didn&#039;t want to draw their facial expressions or wanted to make sure the audience remembers YO THIS CHARACTER HAS BOOBS even if those sexually objectified features aren&#039;t even emphasized in the same shot?<br />
<br />
Like this trick got to the point where it was DISTRACTING. Not like &quot;oh, boobs&quot; -braindead- I just kept thinking &quot;wait, stop I want to see people talking now please. Why do I need another pan-up on this character now?&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also pretty sad that so much of a series purportedly about the supernatural and with what seems to be a decent budget spends so much time on the human characters, because the supernatural characters are pretty much absent. The most often shown supernatural characters just look like ordinary humans - even if Mariko&#039;s boobs jiggle for no reason 100% of the time. I&#039;m fine with slice-of-life fantasy. Unfortunately, the plot has to actually be GOOD for that to be sufficient. Before I go to a complete segue to the biggest plot failings, series like &quot;Natsume Yuujincho&quot; and &quot;xxxHolic&quot; may only have one new, supernatural character every episode/arc, while focusing largely on mundane things (and by and large it&#039;s more than one character), like cooking (also this show&#039;s favorite thing for some reason), or mundane school stuff or romance or holiday presents... but they still introduce those characters and they&#039;re interesting to watch and there&#039;s neat-looking fantastical stuff involved. This... does nothing. Maybe off in the corner once an episode, on average, there&#039;s a non-human thing. Briefly. That&#039;s it. If I wanted a nice story about a bunch of weirdos with -by and large - hearts of gold in an apartment building I&#039;d reread &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;. At least that had story.<br />
<br />
The base plot is fine. It&#039;s typical for these series. Sure, the magical powers gained really suck and that joke gets old very, very quickly. Like... right when they&#039;re introduced, actually. The issue isn&#039;t so much the base plot itself as the way the story treats its characters and spits out nonsensical ageist bs every single episode.<br />
<br />
I am aware that characters are usually not perfect. But Inaba is a moron (even moreso than usualy for a sort of shonen protagonist) and a hypocrite with at least a bit of a sexist undertone. The current primary antagonist is a teacher - Aiko - who, at least according to Inaba, judges people based on little information and relies on that distorted frame of reference to base her ideas of them. He heavily dislikes this. The problem is that INABA does the exact same thing to every single person in the show, including his secondary crush and idol, Ryu, as well as his closest peer, Tashiro, and his sempai, Akine. In point of fact... ALL HUMANS DO THIS. That&#039;s just... that&#039;s how we work. You don&#039;t know everything about anyone unless you&#039;re, I don&#039;t know, omniscient and telepathic? I&#039;m unsure if this is a translation issue or what, but I believe the problem Inaba has is that Aiko STEREOTYPES, and then, upon being shown evidence that she&#039;s in the wrong, doesn&#039;t change her behavior and doubles down on her beliefs even against the weight of contradictory evidence, or that she&#039;s hurting people. Sure, in basic terms, the show describes that (or the translation does). But it&#039;s very muddled. The concept itself is good to follow with... if the stereotyping + refusal to change out of that is ACTUALLY the concept the show wants to go with.<br />
<br />
Conversely, Ryu exists. I don&#039;t hate Ryu. He&#039;s attractive. He&#039;s... not evil? He&#039;s clearly at least in lust with Inaba (as evidenced by his desire to give Inaba a bath, and then acting upon that desire quite happily at least twice, on top of calling Inaba &quot;a gem waiting to be polished&quot;, and talking about how he enjoys watching Inaba&#039;s development and how he basically does nothing else in the story but creepily stalk Inaba; also, for all that he was rightfully pissed off that the Antiquary keeps stealing his hair to sell, he was quite happy for Inaba to have a bit as a gift). Ignoring the potential pedophelia aspects there because we have no idea how specifically old Ryu is (and basically every adult male on this show is in lust with Inaba; it&#039;s very weird), we know basically nothing about Ryu. He once had his shinigami patrol. He offered like three sentences of advice to Inaba in episode 1. He pops in to smile every few episodes and potentially gave Inaba a magical ability that by episode 18 Inaba has yet to make use of. His hair has magical properties? He&#039;s worked for the government doing... something. He&#039;s purportedly down on his luck. That&#039;s it. Shows time skip all the time, so we&#039;re not shown the entirety of characters interacting and getting to know each other. But it&#039;s heavily implied that we see most if not all of Inaba&#039;s interactions with Ryu on-screen. Which means they really barely know each other. Yet from the first time Inaba sees Ryu, he is smitten (with lust and/or idol worship, w/e). And seemingly worships the ground the man walks on. Admittedly we tend to give the people we care about/our crushes/idols more leeway than we do others. But this... I guess it&#039;s not bad because Inaba&#039;s adoration of Ryu doesn&#039;t bother Ryu, but Aoki&#039;s stereotype impression of Inaba insults him?<br />
<br />
Then the show shouldn&#039;t frame it the way it does! IT&#039;S JUST CONFUSING!<br />
<br />
As a simple example for Inaba&#039;s stereotyping versus Aoki&#039;s stereotyping, Inaba stereotypes based on gender a lot. In episode 1, his first reaction to learning that there&#039;s a female resident - who&#039;s older than him - living in the apartment complex, he says, &quot;Alone??? Even though she&#039;s a GIRL??&quot; Upon meeting her he later attempts to stop her from going out on her own. This complete stranger who is older than him. Sure, offering to go with her might be fine. But like... dude, lay off the repeated attempts? And there are other things. It&#039;s just... it&#039;s exhausting. This show has major issues with gender dynamics and yes, the old &quot;boys will be boys&quot; bs gets used at least twice. It&#039;s subverted once in a cute way, because everyone plans for Hase and Inaba to get married and the subversion is tied into it, but that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
And Yamamoto. I have no idea what to make of this storyline. At its base, Yamamoto is an arrogant character who wants to show off her potential intelligence to her lessors, which likely leads to no one liking her. But apparently the writing team for this series had no idea how to present that incredibly simple concept. So Yamamoto enters this English conversation club and is annoyed that they don&#039;t speak English all the time (which she doesn&#039;t attempt either; even while explaining, apparently, the different meanings of words used in English and Japanese, she&#039;s still speaking in Japanese; this would be intelligent reflection on her hypocrisy IF THE STORY ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP ON IT rather than just making it muddled like everything else in this train wreck). She then shows off that she seemingly reads Russian literature, and arrogantly suggests they translate a Western movie rather than an anime film, despite the whole club wanting to translate an anime film because people liked it the last time they did it.<br />
<br />
Inaba airs this to his colleagues in his usual &quot;I just don&#039;t understand&quot; because apparently arrogance is a foreign concept to Mr. I Am Younger Than Others But Still Feel More Prepared to Care For Them Because In Ep 1 I Beat Up My Boyfriend For Reasons. His neighbors, who have neither met nor seen Yamamoto, surmise for no apparent reason other than potentially her age, gender, and possibly nationality, that it&#039;s unlikely that she actually likes the Russian literature she&#039;s talking about/seen reading onscreen. Ignoring that baseless and implicitly problematic assertion - all demonstrated while we&#039;re seeing a naked Yamamoto crouching with her back to the &#039;camera&#039; for some reason - sure, arrogant and judgmental asshats do frequently fake liking &quot;intellectual&quot; stuff to get Brain points with people. But 1) there&#039;s no evidence she doesn&#039;t ACTUALLY like them, and 2) whether or not she likes them is immaterial because while making what could easily be a baseless ageist/sexist assertion about someone you don&#039;t know is also dumb, the point is that SHE&#039;S ARROGANT, not what her personal preferences are. Inaba doesn&#039;t read Dostoyevsky. What&#039;s he going to do, quiz her on it like a gatekeeping fanboy? This story is so nonsensical.<br />
<br />
Which leads to the... morals? &#039;Life lessons&#039;? Better known as things some group of high baby boomers said while drinking somewhere? Because it&#039;s half typical ageist &#039;in my day&#039; bs and 3/4s complete nonsense. For instance, the episode I gave up on - spoiler alert it&#039;s not an important story episode - Inaba is dealing with new, dumb coworkers. That&#039;s it. They&#039;re just dumb. There is literally nothing else to this. But for some reason he so fails to understand how it is possible for people to just be dumb that when he airs his issues to his neighbors, they turn it into something about how &quot;information used to be earned&quot; and &quot;communicating with your body is important&quot; (this by two drunk, giggling, middle-aged(?)-styled male characters talking about two teenagers) and &quot;technology makes people stupid&quot; and then INABA STARTS THINKING THIS. This whole episode. It&#039;s not THAT deep. And this is so. many. of. the. episodes. It&#039;s one thing for a slice-of-life episode to overanalyze something for comedy or &quot;today&#039;s lesson in life&quot; or something. But this is just... meaningless. It takes Completely Missing the Point While On My Nostalgia-Revisionist Horse to olympic levels. It&#039;s also not funny.<br />
<br />
So the art is good to dumb, the plot is utter nonsense, the humor fizzles out, particularly once you realize that a good chunk of it is various male adults molesting Inaba without his consent (seriously, even his HOMEROOM TEACHER DOES IT, oh but it&#039;s okay he had a good reason 9_9), I mean yeah it would be bad enough if it was WITH his consent, which the show implies actually he&#039;s okay with it but just... it&#039;s such a mess. I haven&#039;t even gotten into MOST of the gender stereotyping bs that Inaba does or Aoki does.<br />
<br />
The story meanders at the best of times, makes no sense most of the time, and bad &#039;sense&#039; at its worst. The art is average for a modern show bridging the gap between shounen-ai and shounen, but depressingly bad when it comes to its boobservice character and pan-up shots. It has two good songs, and the music is otherwise forgettable. It has terrible issues with characterization, underuses its fantastical elements, and perpetuates, at best, very bad gender dynamics.<br />
<br />
If you want to see a good slice-of-life supernatural show, watch &quot;Natsume Yuujinchou&quot; (but not the OVAs) or read &quot;xxxHolic&quot;. If you want a quirky comedy about a bunch of folks at the same apartment building, read &quot;Maison Ikkoku.&quot; Heck, &quot;Beyond the Boundary&quot; has problematic gender dynamics, but at least the art is really good and it makes good use of its supernatural elements and it&#039;s funny and the plot is by and large good and it actually subverts some stereotypes and tropes in interesting ways. Watch that. Skip this.

    To start with, this anime brings back memories of me watching love hina and ahh my goddess !. Not saying they are similar to each other but how the whole community of characters in anime plays a part in their roles. <br />
<br />
Therefore, I want to review this anime as good vibe anime or more like something everyone gets to watch it. I do urge that this anime has been underrated. <br />
<br />
Story: Our main character Inaba suffers from losses of his parents and struggles with his ongoing life. As the story progress, Inaba encounters many situation of people having issues and ordeals. Encounters such as these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265687">
        are not only encountered in human form but also in youkai areas. Further down the stream, the story becomes apparent of ever changing life Inaba and his daily struggles with youkai and human beings. <br />
<br />
Story -8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: Like able art, normal character designs but enjoyable background art style. <br />
<br />
Art- 7/10 <br />
<br />
Sound: Sound is very good, character voices matches with their personalities and how the youkai sounds are delivered like the oni are just as good. <br />
<br />
Sound- 8/10 <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: To put this anime into perspective, its like a smooth chocolate cup cake that you enjoy eating it slowly than gulping it at once. Watch this anime at night will enhance the experience as you might feel sleep like a baby while feeling good about yourself. (yes this happened to me if you are wondering) <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10  <br />
<br />
Perks of the show<br />
1. Characters are well developed<br />
2. Story plot is enjoyable<br />
3. Fighting sequences are well put together<br />
4. Each characters plays their roles spectacularly in developing our main character <br />
<br />
Cons<br />
1. Feels like BL between Inaba and Hase at times though thats enjoyable at times  but not always. <br />
2. Wish more art style was given to the characters <br />
<br />
Overall its 8/10 for me and recommended to all the people who wants to get away from cliche and all high intensified anime details. Also, if you want to enjoy an anime in a quiet manner then is for you too :)<br />
<br />

- Had good backstories to understand them<br />
- Had a great storyline<br />
- Had a good lesson specially that somehow I can relate to the main character.<br />
- Had cool opening and ending Its rarely for me to watch them since I always

    An anime to enjoy when you just want to sit back and relax. I read the manga a while back and really enjoyed it and found out there was an anime made when I returned to it last week. I do have to mention that the manga was better in a few ways, so I would recommend reading that first if the story seems to your taste. <br />
<br />
The anime overall is fine and like I mentioned before especially good for just relaxing and enjoying it. However, while it follows the manga almost to the letter (especially the first half of it), the pacing is at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273635">
        times a bit odd. The manga leaves certain things, such as the intensity of reactions or the &#039;mystique&#039; of the yokai and spirits, up to the reader. The anime is more outspoken in this, due to the nature of the medium, which makes certain (visual) reactions or the transparancy of some ghosts a bit odd to me at times. It worked in the manga, but not always in the anime. <br />
<br />
Even so, it is an enjoyable and cute anime and definitely a joy to watch!

    You thought it was Fool; BUT IT WAS ME, DIO! (The tarot cards...)<br />
<br />
Ehem, ehem... Sorry. I needed to do that.<br />
<br />
Anyway! Here&#039;s why you should watch this anime:<br />
<br />
- Story: 9/10. This anime is a slice of life anime. If you enjoy the relaxing types of slice of life that focuses more on the characters than the story, this anime is just to your taste.<br />
<br />
- Art: 7/10. I would say the art is more than decent, but it isn&#039;t really interesting either. The character designs of youkai are pretty neat though.<br />
<br />
- Sound: 10/10. When it comes to anime, I pay a lot of attention to seiyuu&#039;s. And

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256167">
        this anime&#039;s cast is simply AMAZING.<br />
Sawashiro Miyuki, Sugita Tomokazu, Nakamura Yuuichi, Nakai Kazuya, Morikawa Toshiyuki, Koyasu Takehito... GREAT CAST.<br />
Oh and also, I really enjoy the OP and ED themes.<br />
<br />
- Characters: 10/10. Each and every character has really unique personalities which makes this slice of life anime really fun to watch.<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment: 10/10. I refresh the new anime pages every Monday to see if Youkai Apartment is out... I really do.<br />
<br />
- Overall: 9/10. I really love this anime. It keeps on getting better and better with each episode. I hope it&#039;s also popular in Japan and they make a new season of it.<br />
<br />
P.S. We are 8 episodes into the series when I&#039;m writing this review.
