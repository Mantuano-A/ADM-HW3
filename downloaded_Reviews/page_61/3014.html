    Have you ever watched Naruto? So I introduce to you, Naruto but Italian, if I can call this &quot;Italian&quot;.<br />
<br />
Historical manga/anime always catch my attetion, sometimes because I want to read about a especific age in comic books, or because I want to experience the memorable colors and landscapes that talented artists are willing to make in animation. And for general information, every year ends up being highlighted about some historical anime, we also have the probability of it being worthwhile, which can be difficult lor issues that many directors are not well prepared to dedicate themselves to a work like this, is also very rare

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337102">
        for some of them to receive sequences and being an anime season highlight, as a door to discover a world that seemed to be interesting through several literary phrases that we consume in books.<br />
<br />
As soon as I was watching the Arte ad, I was prepared for a story that would be realistic, sensitive and feminist due to the manga&#039;s praise, and could get so close to ancient Italy, but I was innocent to believe it. Starting with all the background, I&#039;ll be honest with you, the background art is poor and completely forgettable, it&#039;s the kind of generic background art that you could find in some generic fantasy of the season, they are all lightened by a pale color that spoils the whole identity of the scene, it seems like the same color tone for each place, it makes me disgusted, besides being boring shots, they are not as inspiring as their age should be, come on I&#039;m talking about the age of renaissance! This should be a alive art, for a story that shows the love of &quot;art&quot;, I think that even Kakushigoto of this season that talks about manga and comics, has a more appropriate and visually beautiful scenario, it is rare to have a type of scene in that I can enjoy the art scene, the streets look the same, the saturated color doesn’t help, it’s as if I’m seeing Venice increasingly empty.<br />
<br />
I need to mention this but how hard this anime tries to be a historic but it fails in the main part which is to make characters and people befitting the scenario, fuck shit, every character acts like a Japanese, they bow, close their eyes when they feel embarrassed, act like a typical high school teenager, and I don&#039;t even want to mention so many &quot;anime&quot; lines that this work provides, just hearing Angelo&#039;s sisters say the word &quot;onii-chan&quot; made me sick, honestly this is the representation of an Italian person born and raised in the Renaissance era? Obviously not, and it hurts a lot for me to be able to get closer to the world, it is not so difficult for them to adhere to a more formal language of their time, as you can see Emma as a great example of historical anime centered in France but that keeps the characteristics of French people, what Arte does is offensive, and I doubt that anyone who is Italian would not be bothered by this, put these characters in a Japanese setting and they will not change easily.<br />
<br />
This anime is basically a shounen but with a female protagonist, so many clichés are always being used over time, you don&#039;t have a minute&#039;s break to contemplate the beauty of the scenery, because besides being so poor, the anime totally ignores actions and consequences, want an example? See our protagonist overcoming her carpentry challenge in one episode, or the fact that she carries heavy bags without her arms shaking or exhausted, everything is done in an easy way, you think a new challenge will be put in place to intrigue, but he it is easily overcome, it is always like that, in every episode, they all end up having no depth or impact in that way, and if Arte doesn’t win the challenge, she just has a flashback from her family and she will win, like a generic protagonist would do, and being that type of protagonist, it is obvious that she will scream out there that she will be a great painter for her exaggerated determination, all these reasons make me distance myself more and more from the character, I don&#039;t see this anime being something unique, if not just in portraying a scenario, because the rest is awful with repetitives ideas.<br />
<br />
The dramas are garbage, dramas that can be kept as a reality and a challenge of the time, many people faced the rejection that the noblest families had about women who would follow dreams that are not to serve for a beautiful boy of the nobility, here was all nucleus, but it is clearly forgotten over time, and should be the most important point of the work to be debated, but instead we have this small simulation:<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to draw!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#039;re women!!&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to...&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#039;re women!!&quot;<br />
&quot;I...&quot;<br />
&quot;WOMEN!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I am absolutely sure that artists from ancient Italy would not act like that, and even if it is related, they could listen her to it until the end, but the anime must constantly show the viewer that the society of men is bad, just it. From a moment that they do all just to serve as a convenient development, which should even be 70% of the focus in each episode that comes up, she is not a pagan sinner, but the anime exaggerates in moments to generate this kind of repercussion, a forced drama that only serves as unnecessary conflicts, which could be improved if they had subtleties in presenting, is totally repetitive and without control of what it should.<br />
<br />
The characters are poorly, as I already mentioned Arte being a generic protagonist of shounen, I can quote Leo who appears to be a well-explored character, but in the end he is just a handsome guy with no difference for identity, the relationship with Arte is very poorly explored, in three episodes and they are already advancing to higher levels, and the author is trying to put a ridiculous romance on top of that, and we have Angelo, a typical innocent teenager who emerged from some Kyoani anime that besides serving as a convenient support to help the protagonist, also has him mini moments of romance, for an anime that says men are bad, romanticizing the most beautiful ones is always the right choice to classify them as &quot;they are good men&quot;, it is a terrible fujobait and total waste of characterization, I should be watching the fight of a determined girl but I see her fall in love with her master because he is hot.<br />
<br />
I don’t know why this anime/manga has the &quot;seinen&quot; demography because it has nothing to compose a real seinen, and not that it is difficult, Emma as I mentioned is a great seinen, but it doesn’t use these bad clichés in narrative, Emma manages to be unique in his own way, everything here is based on shounen and broadly generic examples, ignoring any fight compatible with the scenario, I wonder if I am the only one who feels frustrated when seeing potential wasted on topics so weaks to approach, I don&#039;t understand this attempt to replicate dramas and arcs of battle-shounen in series with different themes and setting, this is without any inspiration. The visuals of the characters and animation are also weak, the animation hasen&#039;t life to represent this necessary environment that could generate empathy for the audience, there is without use of scenery, the colors of the characters are bad, totally pale and do not matching and neither contrast with their own, it is saturated being able to look at that &quot;Carnival&quot; in the previous episode, perhaps the good points I could mention are the artistic information that we can see being examples and even the soundtrack that combines very well with the theme, but as for the other topics... Arte doesn&#039;t have a solid story.<br />

    In a Nutshell<br />
Based on the manga by Kei Ohkubo, Arte feels like a shoujo story. 16th century Florence, Italy. Arte is a noblewoman, who dreams of becoming an artist. While it is an impossible career choice for a female born in a noble family, she is even ready to give up on her status only to become an artist. Will her whole-life-dream translate into reality?<br />
<br />
More About Story<br />
The story of Arte takes place in the early sixteenth century in Florence, Italy. Arte is a young noblewoman, who dreams of being an artist, which is an unthinkable desire for any high-status-women at that time to have; her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344646">
        mother does not want her to waste even a second of her time on this, as she describes it, useless hobby that will not bring any profit. And it is understandable, Arte’s father dies and for Arte’s mother to stay cashed up, she wants her daughter to marry a rich nobleman, to give birth to 4 children and live happily ever after. Arte is not ready to give up on her all life’s dream and does not want to follow her mother’s ideals that involve everything, but not Arte; Arte sets out into the city with her portfolio to seek a master artist to apprentice under. Of course, not a single person wants to do anything with a girl, which you should understand, if you were not asleep during your history classes. Thankfully, Arte meets always- grumbling-Leo, who unwillingly accepts Arte as his apprentice, only to prove her-- a girl she is will never succeed.<br />
<br />
Animation Does not Reflect Sixteenth Century<br />
While the animation is nothing special, it is bright and attractive, with plenty of detail on clothing and decorations. The series also pays so much attention to the process of drawing, which is very time-consuming and interesting to observe. However, my only complaint is that the series looks ‘way too bright’, for a drama. <br />
<br />
Do Not Give Up On Your Dreams<br />
Arte is the main protagonist of the series. She is a brave, cheerful and very energetic young lady, who will never give up on her dreams no matter what other people may think. She does not want to rely on her mother’s plan for her to find a rich nobleman to marry, she wants to pursue her own dreams and to draw; she does not want to be a caged bird. Her determination and love for art is the reason Leo accepts her as his apprentice.  However, Arte is a bit too hasty, when it comes to decision making, which always causes her and Leo troubles. <br />
<br />
With that being said, characters are quite interesting to follow. Leo gives his reasons, why he wants to prove Arte that she will never succeed as an artist and Arte’s love for art is quite understandable. I do admit that I would love to see more development on Arte’s part, she acts way too childish, but what can I expect from a child? She is a child and acts like a child. <br />
<br />
Criticism/Fun Fact<br />
Given the series&#039; and character&#039;s name, it is quite obvious that Arte is ARTEmisia Gentileschi. However, the problem is that many facts about what she was in real life and how the mangaka decided to depict her, were quite different, to say the least. Maybe, just maybe, Artemisia’s life is something a mangaka would not want to depict true to fact for some known reasons, I do not know, but I was hoping that the mangaka would have made a better research. Do not get me wrong, I do appreciate the mangaka’s work and that their work is a great tribute Artemisia Gentileschi, who had, let us say, not an easy life. <br />
<br />
All in all, while I do not hide the fact that if I were the creator of Arte, I would make things different, I still, however, highly appreciate this tribute to Artemisia Gentileschi, which was somewhat enjoyable to watch. Would I recommend this series to anyone? Of course, and do google Artemisia Gentileschi paintings and biography, when you finish watching the series. It is worth it.

    Arte is an anime adaptation of the manga based on the era of The Renaissance from the 16th century. It’s not often you get to hear such a premise spelled out so freshly intact about in this era. Arte is not only the titular protagonist but also a woman with a strong will, determination, and thirst to prove herself as an artist. She is here to prove that in a male dominant world, there’s a place for her.<br />
<br />
The premise is quite simple. It’s about this 14 year old heiress from Florence who has a passion for painting. After her father passes away, she’s been put

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344651">
        on a road by her mother to married. Of course, Arte continuously pursues her passion even if it means leaving the house and becoming what she always wants to be: a painter. What follows her is a journey of hardship as she is a woman. At this time period, the male society dominates in her field of work. It becomes a feminist movement that she pushes to the envelope to prove herself. The first episode includes a crowd mocking Arte for her dream just because of her gender. After declaring ‘to give up being a girl’ by cutting her hair, Arte vows to change the system in this time era. It may seem like an impossible mission but for Arte, she carries a sense of self as who she is. And for that, I’m pleased to say the show sets up for quite an intriguing plot carried by its creative themes.<br />
<br />
It’s not just her words or the haircut that matters. It’s what the actions that count. Arte may have declared herself to give up being a girl but she still has to prove her worth or eat her own words. During her journey, she meets Leo, an important character who would change her life forever. As a professional painter, he accepts Arte to his studio because she reminds him of himself. The first step to becoming a painter is no simple task as Arte must learn the fundamentals and craftsmanship of the profession. Luckily, Arte’s personality earns respect for her peers by hard work, determination, and learning from mistakes. She’s a type of relatable character that’s easily likable and in fact, some characters such as Angelo even falls for her. Despite that, Arte puts her dream as priority and forges a friendship with Angelo. She even attracts the attention of Veronica, one of the most beautiful women in Florence as the pair strikes a friendship. Likewise, Arte even manages to make friends with Catalina, a girl notorious for her stubborn personality. As every episode ventured on, Arte continuously to show an eagerness to make her dream come true.<br />
<br />
Watching Arte doesn’t take much commitment but based on a historical setting, it can be somewhat frustrating to understand its culture. Even though the setting takes place in a European culture, it hardly felt like a society. I don’t know the exact inner style of the European ways of life but to say the least, the show’s atmosphere didn’t exactly match. Even with places like Venice introduced later in the show, it doesn’t seem to take full advantage of its world setting. So in essence, if you want the most out Arte, don’t expect the show to be about the setting. It’s about her.<br />
<br />
Still, a question revolves around how much you can appreciate Arte as the titular character. At its core, Arte exemplifies that women can do what men are capable of. In this case, it’s about being an artisan in a field dominated by males. While this anime isn’t overly feminist, it’s hard to ignore its aspects on different occasions. Viewers may feel turned off by such themes and sometimes, I can’t help but feel sorry for Arte. That’s where reality hits and we have to realize the struggles these young women faces during that era. <br />
<br />
Seven Arcs is a somewhat of a strange studio of choice considering their previous projects all had some form of fantasy elements. Arte contains much more realism based on a real life setting with its culture, geography, and architectures. While most of this is fairly balanced, it doesn’t truly capitalize on its world setting. Outside from what you see, there’s not much depth that went into the artistic elements of the European style architectures. Florence attracts tourism and trade although the anime plays down on the overall world building. Even places like Venice doesn’t truly spark as a unique destination with its seaports and artwork. On the other hand, I do appreciate how the anime made Arte look as fierce as she can be. After cutting her hair, she shows not only traits of masculinity but also lives by her words through sheer will. The voice acting plays an important role to show how much she wants to achieve her dream. Similarly, other relevant characters in the show such as Leo and Veronica displays characteristics well suited for their roles.<br />
<br />
The way Arte is constructed is aimed for audience to follow her character journey. It’s not about the historical setting or its culture. Because let’s face it, Arte still has so much to learn from her experiences and as a young woman, she has to adapt with everything and everyone around her. This is a story about a character who follows her dream and to prove that anyone can do anything they put their mind into.

    For some reason, I keep picking the most controversial seasonals of 2020 to review! If you just took a quick glance at Arte, you wouldn&#039;t think this would be one of the most divisive and fiercely polarizing series of the year. One half of MAL thinks this series is really sweet, relaxing and wholesome. The other half is positively screeching about what a vile abomination this is and how it&#039;s one of the worst anime they&#039;ve ever seen in their entire lives.<br />
<br />
Arte is based on a long-running and successful manga about a young girl in 16th century Florence who dreams of becoming a great artist.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344734">
        She is loosely based on an amalgamation of Sofonisba Anguissola and Artemisia Gentileschi, which is where she gets her name from. Arte isn&#039;t naturally the most genius painter to ever live, but she works extremely hard and is willing to devote her entire life to creating beautiful works of art. The director of Arte is Takayuki Hamana, who also directed the last anime I reviewed, Beast Player Erin. Arte actually shares a LOT in common with Erin in terms of its direction. They&#039;re both very feel good, slice of life series with very slow pacing that aim for tons of warm fuzzy feelings at the risk of being boring. Both are led by very strong, paragon female protagonists to serve as an idealistic example for a young female audience. I rated both series a 7 on MAL, but I do think Erin is a little better. On Anilist I gave Erin a 7.5 because intervals are a very useful feature. Meanwhile, MAL treats Erin as one of the greatest anime ever made and has Arte rated below Shoujo Ramune. Yes, it&#039;s rated lower than the infamous pedo hentai with that yogurt meme.<br />
<br />
So why is Arte so hated? The main reason is that it deals heavily with sexism and Arte constantly having to deal with 1500s attitudes towards women. Most of Europe didn&#039;t really have &quot;The Woman Question&quot; IE: &quot;Should women have a purpose beyond being broodmares?&quot; until the 1600s and the Enlightenment Period. Arte is correct that sexism was a very prevalent problem in 1500s Italy. However, Arte isn&#039;t historically accurate in portraying our heroine as the first and only female painter in the mid 1500s. There were actually many female painters during the Renaissance Period, so the shock and &quot;BUT YOU&#039;RE A WOMAN!&quot; responses she gets in the first 4 episodes seem a bit silly. Arte seems to have confused the 1500s for the 1300s. Back in the 1300s, all artists were men and ONLY men were allowed to paint. That&#039;s because only the Catholic Church had the money to commission art and all paintings were done by priests and monks. Only men could be priests or monks. Painters during the Renaissance weren&#039;t the upper crust of society, they just made paintings for the upper crust and were considered lowly artisans. That&#039;s why it wasn&#039;t a big deal for &quot;a mere woman&quot; to be a painter at that time. The nobility didn&#039;t feel it was a threat to the social order because being a painter is just a shitty job anyways. <br />
<br />
Is Arte SJW propaganda? Should we REEE about it? No and no. Most of the anger against modern feminism stems from the idea that women have already reached full equality, but SJWs want to elevate women above men and get revenge on men. I&#039;m not going to go on a tangent about maternity leave and whether or not the United States has actually achieved true equality yet. Arte wasn&#039;t made by America for a Western audience! Arte was made by Japanese people for a Japanese audience. They knew that foreigners would watch it, but the director was focused on how Japanese audiences would react to it. I&#039;ve heard people complaining that Arte feels like something America would make in the 1980s or 90s, but that&#039;s culturally kind of where Japan is in regards to gender equality. America has female CEOs now. Japan still doesn&#039;t. Japan is still trying to get beyond the cultural concept of &quot;office flowers&quot;. Japanese women who do really well in college, yet are hired to be gofer secretaries, fetch tea for their old man boss, and get a swat on the ass for their troubles. Then they get pressured at age 30 to quit and go be a housewife, so there isn&#039;t much chance of promotion. Even if you feel Arte is outdated and preaching to the choir, keep in mind you&#039;re not the target audience. You&#039;re not a young Japanese girl or an office lady! They see Arte as something bold and a breath of fresh air, which is why the manga has been running for 7 years and is doing well. <br />
<br />
Another complaint about Arte is ironically the art. I will admit that Arte isn&#039;t exactly pretty for a series about art. It was made by Seven Arcs, who is mostly known for making a shitty ecchi called Sekirei. They are NOT a well loved studio. I also suspect that the Covid Pandemic may have had an impact on the production. Arte starts out looking alright, but it starts to look REALLY ugly in the second half. I mean some utterly hideous CG. However, there are plenty of ugly looking anime out there, so I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a reason to give this a 2/10 and scream about it being the worst ever.<br />
<br />
Isn&#039;t Arte an annoying shonen protagonist like Naruto? No! Arte is Rock Lee! Naruto wants to be the greatest ninja of all time because his father was a ninja leader and he sees it as his birth right. Arte doesn&#039;t want to be the greatest artist of all time, she just wants to make paintings for a living because she loves doing it. Naruto doesn&#039;t take his training seriously for the first 200 episodes of his anime. He was born with an immense amount of innate talent and inherited abilities, so he doesn&#039;t need to work hard. He pulls stupid pranks, eats ramen, then bullshits his way to completely unearned victories. Arte works until her hands bleed and she passes out from strain on a frequent basis. Arte works HARD because art is her life. She isn&#039;t wasting her time pulling pranks or feeling sad for herself. <br />
<br />
So is Arte worth checking out? Hell yes it is! It&#039;s not a perfect series by any means, but it&#039;s pretty damn good. It&#039;s actually my favorite anime I&#039;ve seen so far from 2020. It&#039;s also only 12 episodes, so you could binge the whole thing in an afternoon. If you just want to relax and feel good for a while, I highly recommend checking this one out.

    Good god where to begin with this flaming pile of garbage otherwise known as Arte? Once in a rare while do you come across something so pointlessly dull and boring that you actually get offended by it, so offended by its poor writing, poor characters, poor shallow attempts at making &quot;commentary&quot;, poor genre workings. Everything about this show is poor. After 4 episodes I had a bad feeling, after 7 I had no hope, and now? Now, I&#039;m here to tell you to not bother wasting your time on this trash. <br />
<br />
Before we get into the slaughter of Arte I&#039;d like to point out some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344778">
        MINOR good aspects of this show that keep it from being a 1. The character design isn&#039;t anything to write home about but the dress designs are historical accurate and add a level of elegance that I rather enjoyed. The VA work is also worth praise. It&#039;s not hard to find lots of new anime just putting VAs in roles to have a name to the project or so badly miscast that it takes you out of the story, but every VA sounds like they fit that character. It&#039;s rare to find and underappreciated when done well and I hope people star taking notice of this factor. It&#039;s a shame the cast is stuck to such a bad script but hey the little things right?   <br />
<br />
As for the bad. God where to start? First, why make your setting one of the most interesting point in art history (Florence in the 16th century during the Renaissance) if you&#039;re going to make no attempt at displaying the beauty of this time period? The background art for FLORENCE ITALY looks so poorly put together that you could honestly believe that we were in just some nowhere town in an Isekai. For a show set in the town that had some of the greatest works of art during this time period every building looks the same. Their is NO differentiation in color pallets or depth. It is so poorly put together that you could honestly set this show in a High School and get more out of it. On top of that by episode 8 the character art and animation starts to take a nosedive which is super ironic because it wasn&#039;t like they had the budget there to begin with. It went from being passable (if not a little bland) to being something a visual novel would use for its animated scenes. In fact I think Persona has had better animation.   <br />
Second, the plot. Let me take you through the formula for this show, because their is no real plot. <br />
Opening -&gt; Mary Sue wants to do art related activity or is given art related activity -&gt; Mary Sue is told &quot;WoMEn CaNt Be ArTIsT&quot; or &quot;ArT iS FoR MeN&quot; or &quot;YoU CaNt Do ThAT, OnLY MeN CaN Do ThAt&quot; ext. Whatever variation of surface level misogyny you can come up with goes here and for anyone who has ever dealt with misogyny you will laugh your ass off at how fake this comes off as -&gt; Mary Sue does whatever activity the men think she can&#039;t do because the power of her WILL AND DREAMS -&gt; insert either just enough comedy to not be take as a serious drama or Just enough &quot;foreshadowing&quot; of romance to be taken as a Romance anime without giving actual romance -&gt; end credits.<br />
I&#039;m sure defenders will say &quot;it&#039;s taking its time to set up a believable relationship&quot; or &quot;It&#039;s depicting serious gender inequality&quot; and to you I say...where? The relationship idea is broken by episode 5 when the only thing close to romance is a teenage girls chest getting tight because she&#039;s around this dude. Is this supposed to be Romance because it looks more like bullshit to me. BTW three months have passed at this time (or three years if you go off what the second dude said about progression in the system of being an apprentice) so if the only thing in show you have to show me as &quot;romance&quot; is something a one-sided preteen crush then I&#039;m sorry you fail. As far as Gender Inequality... sure? I mean we get surface level remarks in episode 4 from the prostitute that are once again something a teenager could put together and grow up to realize theirs more depth and nuance then that surface level remarks. Everything else is comedic levels of FEMALE OPPRESSION you would find in a meme making fun of feminist. Theirs no interesting commentary to be made and no depth to it. It&#039;s laughable forced.<br />
Thirdly, what is the point of setting this show in Italy with Italian characters if you&#039;re just going to have them practice normal Japanese customs? Yes, I&#039;m sure this is nitpicky but I&#039;m not the only one asking this question. If you want to have character of different cultural backgrounds you have to build in those cultures to your narrative or else it&#039;s just changing the paint of a car. It might look and seem different but under it&#039;s just the same. This show could have took a look at the culture of Italy and made for a rather different type of anime that despite the issues could still have praise for something new. Instead it sticks with every single Japanese cultural norm we see in anime and comes off as rather immersion breaking.   <br />
<br />
I think that&#039;s enough bashing on this show for it&#039;s piss poor quality. It seems alot of people liked this show, and to you I say great. Glad you did. This show is awful and bad and makes no attempt at coming into its own. All I see is another run of the mill &quot;romance&quot; anime that takes no chances and makes no statements. I hope it never comes back. I hope it gets forgotten in time with the shows just like it because if this show becomes &quot;popular&quot; or makes waves in the anime community I&#039;ll truly be shocked at the ability for the anime community to turn a blind eye to anything resembling quality. Then again Bunny-girl senpai is popular and that&#039;s just as bad so who knows...   <br />
<br />

    Arte is a fine show, that gives us such a strong and fun lead character, but also a nice and peaceful relaxing setting, despite it&#039;s many usage of tropes of those times. But that doesn&#039;t take anything away from the story in my book. It&#039;s still a very pleasant show, and here is why.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re introduced into an old and colourful setting, introducing us to a girl called Arte whom wants to an artist. Arte is a fun character with loads of personality and determination. She&#039;s someone you can really cheer for, and hope for the best. But she&#039;s not the only one. You got some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337109">
        other fun characters like her instructor Leo, who seems quite laid back in some areas, but knows what he is doing. Both really mesh well into a good partnership.<br />
<br />
I honestly wonder how far Arte will go when it comes to her work, and how she&#039;ll handle being in this kind of place. With how people view others. With the story following her growth to being a great artist, or following her passion. Which is lovely.<br />
<br />
The art style is as I&#039;ve described, colourful, beautiful, everything of that formula. Really great to look at honestly. Along with the sounds being fit for purpose for every scene.<br />
<br />
Arte for sure is a fun show, and I&#039;ll keep watching, so should you!

    Dropped this show as of Episode 4<br />
<br />
To start with, I have never been a fan of Teacher/Student, Master/Disciple relationships, but if done right, I can ignore the dynamics and uncomfortable age gap. However, there&#039;s just no chemistry for relationship between these two characters. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s disappointing how quickly Arte goes from pursuing her passion against all odds to being love-crazed for the first man (who&#039;s not her father) that she really interacted with. The only basis for her feelings is that Leo treats her indiscriminately, that he treats her like any other apprentice and not just a woman. <br />
<br />
I can respect Leo for acting as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340432">
        professional instructor should in this situation, but I really can&#039;t respect Arte for developing feelings solely for that. They&#039;ve had very little personal interaction at this point, yet Arte is so distracted by the &quot;doki-doki&quot; in her heart that she can&#039;t focus on her passion anymore...the passion she ran away from home for and chopped off her hair for. Given the premise of this show, I really can&#039;t forgive the story for just nose-diving to romance-obsessed teenage love.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, for an anime about art, the art really doesn&#039;t stand out. Also, this anime is labeled as historical, not fantasy or historical fantasy. Therefore, I don&#039;t think Arte&#039;s Japanese mannerisms are justifiable in Renaissance Italy.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, this anime is rated so poorly because of the unwillingness of the plot to be the seinen anime it promised to be. The story leans heavily towards shojou and being intended for a shojou audience rather than a mature audience. Kind of like Marvel releasing a PG13 version of the Rated R Deadpool just for a cash grab. This anime does the same. For the purposes of reaching a wider, more general audience, this anime wears big fat rose-tinted glasses that ruins what could have been a delightfully complex story about Renaissance Art in Italy. <br />
<br />

    STORY: A lovely story about a noble woman trying to be an artist during the Renaissance era. In case you didn&#039;t know, women of the Renaissance were denied all political rights and were expected to get married, have children and perform the duties of a housewife. Of course there were still a few female painters that thrived during this era, but it was rare. So this is a story about Arte.<br />
<br />
The art is great and It&#039;s nice to be able to see Florence in the 16th century by the eyes of the Japanese. It&#039;s definitely not accurate, but I don&#039;t think people watch anime to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338682">
        learn about history. It&#039;s just a way the author did, so we could locate ourselves in time and space. Which means different laws and a completely different society. <br />
<br />
The characters(until now) are all very likeable and it&#039;s very relaxing to see the protagonist work her way up until she&#039;s an official painter.<br />
<br />
One thing that I have to mention is that, five episodes in, I do consider this anime &quot;Seinen&quot;, unlike some of the viewers. The story is very simple, there&#039;s not a lot of action and without a doubt, it&#039;s more about the female protagonist. <br />
It has hints of prostitution, gender inequality and society ethics, but the story is not centered on those aspects. It&#039;s centered on a promising artist that lives on these conditions. So we&#039;re going to see character growth with each &quot;issue&quot; that the MC has to deal with.<br />
<br />
I recommend people to try a few episodes of this anime, if you&#039;re looking for something relaxing, fun and easy going.

    Its not bad, but neither its good.<br />
<br />
Watching this, I felt that I had traveled back in time, but not to Renaissance Italy but back to the 90s.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s the story?<br />
&quot;About a woman who tries to excel in a male-dominated discipline while the world is bullying her for trying, but she will go above and beyond to prove that she is as capable as a man of creating art&quot;<br />
<br />
It would not be bad if it had something that would make it stand on its own but there is not, the story is 100% focused on telling a story of gender equality. The big problem? Everything it does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339368">
        to tell that story has already been made by literally everyone else and, in some cases, in a better way.<br />
<br />
The only thing this anime knows how to do is turn to teenager&#039;s movie tropes  from 20 years ago.<br />
<br />
Seriously, outside the cliches of misogyny and meritocracy, this history has nothing.<br />
<br />
It reminds me of that chapter of the simpsons when Lisa said she wanted to join the Football team but then Flanders says &quot;Of course Lisa, it&#039;s not a problem, in fact we already have 3 girls&quot; and when she sees that she leaves.<br />
<br />
The characters are archetypes with not much to emphasize.<br />
<br />
Arte is the classic shonen character who fights for his dreams because she loves art, Dattebayo.<br />
<br />
Leo is the classic grumpy teacher.<br />
<br />
The only interesting character with a good background is Angelo.<br />
<br />
Where is the love for art that the protagonist professes?<br />
There is no communication with images, there is no abstraction on stage, there is nothing that reflects that artistic passion, only people painting, that&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
If this is a love story for art. <br />
Would it not be expected that we enter the mind of the protagonist and witness how she visualizes the world, how she abstracts her experiences and turns them into paintings? <br />
<br />
That would be interesting and would allow us to get to know this girl better.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the focus is to talk about gender equality and romance because this is a shojo and if there is no romance someone will be killed.<br />
<br />
And as for the context where the story happens.<br />
I don&#039;t know why the author chose the Florencia of the Renaissance to tell me this. You don&#039;t have to travel to the Renaissance to talk to me about feminism, you could choose any other place and time.<br />
<br />
The only reason I see why they chose this context is because at that time there was machism and that way they could put all the cliches referring to the subject without looking ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Arte si a great dissapointment for me and its another sad case of something that could be great but its condemned to be forgotten.<br />

    The concept of Renaissance Europe is not one that has been often explored in anime, so when I heard about Arte I was rather intrigued as a history bluff. I also had concerns as to how historically accurate the series would be. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, my worries were misplaced as Arte offers one of the best depictions of Renaissance Italy we’ve ever seen in the medium. If you’re a fan of history, character driven anime, or just want to watch an anime with a very original story, this is for you.<br />
<br />
As I said before, Arte is very much character driven. The series primarily revolves around Arte’s relationships

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344656">
        with other people as well as her attempting to break the expected social role of women. If you don’t enjoy slower paced stories, you will struggle to get into this one. Personally, I appreciated the attention to detail that every character received. Each character felt like a unique part of the story who brought something very important to Arte’s development as a person and artist. <br />
<br />
I think the series is as educational as it is entertaining and does a great job of explaining the ins and outs of Italian art workshops during the era, gender roles, class, etc. Being able to learn while watching a show is a big plus to me. The show also features some really good animation/art design which remains consistent throughout. <br />
<br />
Arte was one of my top 4 shows of the season and I wish more people got a chance to experience this one. I believe if you check it out you will not be disappointed at all. I certainly wasn’t. Arte gets 8 easels out of 10.

    I am enough to be an artist who draws freely above my imagination.<br />
<br />
Arte was born into a noble family in Florence, Italy in the revival era of the 16th century. In this era there were no women became artists, but Arte  loved art did not care about his noble status and tried to become an artist, this is Arte&#039;s journey to be an artist.<br />
<br />
This is an anime that can be considered good and also can be considered bad, located in Florence during the Renaissance, it is an amazing story that makes you think about the meaning of art and human potential.  Arte as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344650">
        the protagonist is a person not only embodies art, but also uses art as a means to change his own destiny. This gives meaning that we have the power to change thoughts, things, and events.  I think his way of thinking is at the core of the Renaissance, and his innovative way of thinking leads to the values ​​and development of modern society.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, Arte offers bright and stunning animations, perfect for anime that deals with art. The atmosphere of the Renaissance century shown is very pronounced where women are still underestimated and the lives of noble families who have their own problems. If art aims to preserve the roots of our culture, society must let artists freely follow their respective visions wherever it takes them, at least that&#039;s what I want to say.<br />
<br />
In addition, Arte&#039;s opening and ending songs strongly illustrate his animations where the opening shows Arte&#039;s struggle to become an artist while the ending shows the memories she went through are depicted in a frame. For the first episode, Seven Arc Studio managed to attract the audience&#039;s interest to follow Arte&#039;s story and his achievements in the arts, at least that was good at the beginning I guarantee it.

    Feminism in history, that&#039;s always one of the talking points when it comes to historical anime, and newbie mangaka Kei Ohkubo has taken that thought and compiled it altogether to form his very first series, Arte. But as many would&#039;ve believed and thought that it was a nice change of pace (even yours truly) when I first read the illusive manga that&#039;s close to being &quot;historically correct&quot; as possible, for a seinen, this plot isn&#039;t grandiose, but it isn&#039;t as cohesive, and I&#039;ll explain why.<br />
<br />
History has taught us the many of ways that feminism has shaped the course of history, not just towards women of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344648">
        modern days, but the extensive &quot;systems&quot; that help build the core foundation that women can be useful members of society. To give a context, women back in the Italian Renaissance age are just merely submissive and marriage tools for men, not given proper respect for the things they do, and are merely an eyesore, thereby creating the &quot;anti-feminist&quot; humanist movement. That&#039;s when female advocacy groups started pushing for women&#039;s equality, something that&#039;s shaped Italy since the 13th century.<br />
<br />
And back to the manga itself, that&#039;s what Arte attempts to show: a classic time where sexism is rampant in the early stages of Europe, and for women to show that they DO have a place, regardless of position and status. Creating a story to mark a significant time of change is good, but that story is somewhat lost in the mix of carving its unique identity.<br />
<br />
Onto the characters: Arte herself is a cheerful but bland protagonist, more than serving the lead role for pushing women&#039;s rights and advocating that women, like men, can be successful people as well in all professions (in this case, being artisans). As much as the slice-of-life &quot;historical romantic&quot; moment is, I can&#039;t help but wonder that even as Arte takes off in the notion to challenge the status quo, what would her role be next as an artisan, to draw for people and be recognized by noblemen that &quot;Oh, I&#039;m a woman, and I can do things that men are able to do as well!&quot; She may be the central character, but the character development is as much situational as her growth in being a growing, budding artist, and more importantly, stepping out in society as a confidence woman.<br />
<br />
Her mentor, artisan Master Leo, he&#039;s a man that&#039;s reluctant and of few words, but his expressions are best through his skilled painting, and the amount of hard work that he&#039;s put into it (not to mention the fame and recognition built upon his young destitute days), that truly shows much of his character. His choice for accepting Arte has her apprentice, though marred by his past with an unhappy childhood and a beggar-ish life, taught him the value to see others just as himself, and see others succeed and recognizing that he&#039;s more than a stepping stone, thereby the &quot;more of you, less of me&quot; characterization. Unfortunately like Arte, his character is that as much situational yet again as his doubts to live on life to the fullest. I&#039;ve definitely appreciated Leo&#039;s existence in Arte&#039;s life, but that&#039;s about it if contacts are concerned.<br />
<br />
The other characters that come into Arte&#039;s life, they are pretty much placeholder essentials in her growing-up stages, more than just the rhetoric of getting her to realize that there&#039;s more to life than just her passion for painting by developing friendships and occasionally giving her the courage to push forward in life. This is very much the reason why the manga (that&#039;s after the anime contents) really stood out to me and turned the whole situation around to be a nice read.<br />
<br />
The problem with the anime adaptation is that as much as it tries to recapture the feelings of the manga, it just doesn&#039;t feel like it came from the heart at all. Only repurposing to rush the sequence of events, and therefore creating the &quot;make-or-break&quot; juncture that just ticks (or sometimes) turn me off. Don&#039;t misjudge me though, I do love 1-to-1 translations from medium to medium, but for Arte I feel is one of those series that truly needs that treatment to fully enjoy the show in the broadest of appeals.<br />
<br />
After the massive flailing of business practices and splitting resources, studio Seven Arcs have finally gotten their shit together (after splitting into Seven Arcs Pictures from the original as a subsidiary in 2012 and merged as one entity in 2019). That&#039;s not to say that the merge results in the hope of good quality though. As vibrant as Arte could have been, it felt simplistic and below-average, even for trying to replicate the Renaissance period and sticking true to the times of its day. With a lil&#039; bit more resources, I&#039;d even think that this show would have looked more beautifully, and not so painfully generic.<br />
<br />
In the sound department, all is really fine though, nothing to complain about. Veteran VAs playing the characters, they do a good job at their roles respectively, and it&#039;s honestly bearable in my opinion.  Both OP and ED themes are cheerful, energetic and more down-to-earth sounding, to which they sound really good to me. And at long last I can say that Maaya Sakamoto has finally written a good song after quite sometime.<br />
<br />
Despite the numerous &quot;what-have-yous&quot; that really should come as a warning to those who have watched this show, it&#039;s a fine, watchable show, but really I&#039;d recommend the highly praised manga any day than the lifeless bloodsweat-spent time of the anime. As always mentioned: &quot;The potential was there, but it was never fully utilized as a strength to draw people in.&quot; From a historical fiction view, this was a good watch if you don&#039;t care much about the controversy behind it, and I honestly can give it that if this was all that&#039;s going for. But as it stands, the manga is so much better, but so is the anime as well in decent form.

    Why you might not like Arte : <br />
- Gender Discrimination ( Sexism ) <br />
- Signs of big age gap relationships<br />
- Lack of chemistry despite being categorized as romance.<br />
Why you might like Arte : <br />
- History aspects <br />
- Slice of Life aspects <br />
<br />
I understand why people dislike this show. But as a partial history lover and a Slice of Life enthusiast, this anime was quite fascinating. <br />
<br />
It explores the 16th century, the age of Renaissance where women were unable to become artists. Centering the story around a woman named Arte, a beautiful and determined illegal young girl who wants to become an artist. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s not really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344117">
        anything special about Arte. It&#039;s just the age of Renaissance but represented as an anime. Hence not really making it stand out, leaving just the excess of gender discrimination hanging about and making people become toxic. But I find it fun. <br />
<br />
Despite she being bullied because she&#039;s a female, she still strives to become what she wants to be. Doing anything in order to achieve her dreams. Yeah, you should just drop it if you hate Slice of Life and history.<br />
<br />
So the conclusion? Well, if you like history and slice of life and you know a bit about the age of Renaissance then you might want to give this a try. Otherwise you&#039;ll probably end up losing your braincells nearly every episode. <br />
<br />
p.s. I didn&#039;t start this anime expecting romance but pure Slice of Life and History. <br />

    A really good and intriguing show.<br />
<br />
The premise of this show is good but it could be a little better developed,Of course the discrimination is well portrayed but it could have a little DRAMA.<br />
<br />
The main character is very charismatic making you cheer for her every minute, and the cast also leaves something to be desired, and with base construction for some really good ones, Convincing us that they are not characters without feet or heads (figurative sense). Over time not only do I realize how good it is but the neighborhood also does, but of course there are always the ignorant on duty<br />
<br />
The cinematographic plans in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338387">
        arts are cohesive and manage to convey the emotion that the scene demands<br />
<br />
I am curious to know each step of this journey and always wanting to see which doors will open to art.<br />

    As I make this repost with possible spoilers, I&#039;d say that this anime this anime goes way beyond than fancy historical and all that fuss about the art,  this anime was about women&#039;s struggle in the chauvinistic world of the Renaissance Period, sure the Italian theme was given a Japanize theme and the characters name most don&#039;t look like Italian, but that&#039;s not the point that the original creator, Ookubo Kei trying to point out , rather it was the stereotype that women faced during the said time where they&#039;re regulated either a wife material or Nun Material, so How do I rate this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354307">
        anime????<br />
<br />
Story- Very Good 8: As there is this Black Lives Matter protest that goes on around the world amid the Covid 19 pandemic , this anime&#039;s story plot was just timely given that women at the time of the Renaissance were just regulated as either to be married off or to be nuns, but here it was about how one girl has to go through all the challenges of proving herself among the male dominated world provide that she could be given a chance where she got one from Leo and everything else is history at least in that anime.....<br />
<br />
Art-Good 7: To someone to give this an unjustified low score on the art , seeming thinks that he is an art Connoisseur, when in reality he must be expecting some panty flashes, welp the good new there were some Arte&#039;s underwear flashes, but the bad new it wasn&#039;t one that he expect, cu&#039;z the underpants that you&#039;ll be seeing on Arte was more of the way back in the said period (Renaissance ) , so booo hoo hooo for not seeing anything erotic......Cu&#039;z that&#039;s the way the Original Creator had it.<br />
<br />
Sound- Good 7: The score was for the opening theme &quot; Clover &quot; by Maaya Sakamoto and ending theme Hare Moyou &quot; by Kiyono Yasuno.<br />
<br />
Character- Very Good 8: That&#039;s for Arte whom despite of being a girl was just too stubborn to simply just limit herself from being a wife to a man that she never met when she can follow her dreams and be what she wants and Leo the only man to gave her a chance to shine. cu&#039;z he too has to go through a lot of struggle just to get out of extreme poverty. However , I was a bit annoyed when Arte in order to prove herself has to show incredible zeal to the point of sacrificing simple luxury essentials like sleeping, eating and taking a break.....<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Good 7: Ok, so it maybe underrated or overrated, but to me this was still enjoyable since you can empathize with the character.<br />
<br />
Overall- Very Good 8: Females Lives Matter so kudos to studio Seven Arcs for choosing this series to have an anime adaptation, unfortunately as very good as it is IMAO this doesn&#039;t deserve a season 2.

    Arte is this season&#039;s unsung show, and perhaps my personal favorite amidst the big ticket ones.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a show on chasing your dreams, women empowerment, thinking outside the box, and enjoying the journey to your destination. In a nutshell, the ED animation sequence fits my thoughts and feelings to the show best: Arte climbing the stairs in her journey to become a renowned painter, surrounded by people who challenge, support, and push her onward -- seen through the paintings that surround the staircase.<br />
<br />
This is also one of those few shows that use staple characters in a tried-and-tested &quot;heroine-against-the-world&quot; storyline that truly works. At times, it might

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344660">
        be too generic, but the colorful (pun intended) characters make it even more interesting (I mean, having two tsundere grown-up men is just something special.<br />
<br />
Plus, being set in Florence and Venice in the Renaissance adds more eye candy and story interest that it&#039;s just a wonderful nostalgia rush for me, having visited both cities a couple of years back.<br />
<br />
Overall, watching every episode Arte is rewarding. It&#039;s easygoing but keeps enough tension to make it interesting. And who couldn&#039;t feel warm inside thanks to our über-genki Best Painter Girl?

    アルテ - The anime adaptation is based on the manga series by Ohkubo, Kei. The idea is borrowed from the life story of a real painter and tries to give an insight into a chapter in contemporary history. Since I am very fond of historical references, it was only a matter of time before I stumbled upon this anime. <br />
<br />
Story: Simple and suitable for the target group, but unfortunately too romantic from a historical point of view (6/10)<br />
In the archaic world of the 16th century, a young daughter from a noble family wants to become a painter. This does not sound very exciting at first,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382289">
        but the story has a kernel of truth. It is not immediately obvious, but the first name Arte could be short for Artemisia and would thus refer to the Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Well, one could object that the anime is set in the early 16th century and Artemisia was born in the late 16th century (1593 - 1656), so her works are more likely to be assigned to the Baroque period. This argument would be justified, since it is accurate. But given the parallels between the anime and Artemisia&#039;s life, to name just a few examples, leaving parental home, finding a teacher, and moving to another major city, the argument in this regard can be neglected. Unfortunately, the story only contains those elements of Artemisia&#039;s life that are bearable for the target group of young people, especially Shoujo. In my opinion, the indication &quot;Seinen&quot; is not correct, because then the anime would be considerably darker and would depict or at least hint at more of the very tragic and sad circumstances in Artemisia`s life. The criticism of historical transfiguration will run like a thread through my review, and as I know I will get a bit carried away at some point due to the subject matter, I apologise in advance. <br />
<br />
Characters: Pleasant but simply structured, a plain attempt to impart wisdom (5/10)<br />
Both the characters and the depiction of their individual stories serve to convey life wisdom. While the historical circumstances are basically portrayed correctly, the difficulties that women could hardly overcome are too romanticised. With that in mind it becomes understandable why the supporting characters, such as Arte&#039;s father and especially Ubertino, have a huge influence on Arte despite the little screen time they have at their disposal. Due to the target group-specific focus on the main character and the comedy, deeper insights into contemporary history, such as the humiliation of the baker in episode 4, remain peripheral.<br />
Arte Spalletti:<br />
An enthusiastic young woman who, after the death of her father, is heiress to a noble but penniless family of the Florentine nobility. Determined to realise her dream of becoming a painter, she defies time and her mother&#039;s will and tries to stand on her own two feet. The anime shows the difficulties, but very mildly. In a historical context, this would be seen as being on the verge of feasibility. To cut a long story short, the portrayal in the anime is simply too cute and does not do justice to the hardships and sacrifices of women in order to free themselves from the shackles of the early modern period (16th century).<br />
Leo:<br />
Given his humble origins, despite his talent, he had to work harder, be more diligent, and endure more hardships to build a reputation and be recognised as an artist. He accepted Arte as his apprentice because her determination and actions reminded him of his youth. He is a good character whose development is outlined and also plausible, yet he is a fiction. The historical role model in this case would be Agostino Tassi and this one would be exactly the opposite. So this deviation is elementary, makes the anime more romantic and less gloomy, but the indication as historical is not accurate in this respect.<br />
Ubertino:<br />
His character is actually one of the most important, so I am surprised that so little attention is paid to him. His character reflects the nature and mindset of the &quot;de Medici&quot; family. Starting with the textile trade, the Medici created a dynasty that lasted from the 15th to the 18th century and is inextricably linked to Florence. Their actions are considered the basis of today&#039;s banking system, and their patronage shaped the Renaissance in Florence. One might object and ask what the evidence of a Medici family connection is. Again, the name, in this case Ubertino, can be helpful as a clue. Around 1516 Lorenzo di Piero de &#039;Medici was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Urbino, which fits into the time and the historical background of the anime plot. However, Ubertino&#039;s actions are much better suited as evidence. As an art dealer, or a merchant in general, he takes on the role of a middleman, which was crucial at the time. On the one hand, he bridges the local distances between artist and customer by taking care of the transport, on the other hand, the time delay is part of his activity, because a work of art takes a long time to be finished. He can provide the financial means for the procurement of paints, ingredients or tools. Since he often deals with different works of art by different artists, his knowledge of value also provides a certain expertise in evaluating the art objects. In rare cases, for example when recognizing a great talent, he may also act as a patron. In my opinion, Ubertion is the best portrayed character, which also impresses me because he has received relatively little screen time.<br />
I have read a couple times that the supporting characters come across as boring. I think that&#039;s a bit of an exaggeration, the characters of Katarīna or Angelo Parker, among others, are likeable and fit well into the plot, but it is unfortunately true that they are basically just colourless extras. However, in my opinion, this does not apply to Veronica. The characterization here is also a kind, basically good-hearted person, but clearly shows that every life has a dark side. For me, she clearly stands out from the extras and is the best elaborated supporting role next to Ubertino. <br />
<br />
Visuals: Try to present the appearance of the era well, but too flawlessly due to CG (6/10)<br />
The visuals are praised in some reviews, as far as the architecture of the buildings and the artistry used are concerned, that&#039;s fine. Through the use of computer-aided graphics, the famous sights of the city are impressively reproduced with a high recognition value, for example the imposing Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, which is rightly the city&#039;s landmark with its beauty. The Ponte Vecchio, one of the most famous and beautiful bridges in the world, which crosses the Arno River, is also well done. The bridge was built in 1345 at the narrowest point of the river. The construction of the small overhanging bridge shutters makes the Ponte Vecchio unique for tourists today. In the series, I was thrilled that the bridge was depicted correctly. It used to be mainly butchers who hawked their wares here, but when the ducal family moved to the nearby Palazzo Pitti in the late 16th century, they decreed that only jewellers could do business on the bridge. This was because they felt disturbed by the smell of meat and so the little bridge shops came into being, which did not exist in Artes&#039; time. The first 30 years of the 16th century were marked by many changes in Florence, including the temporary removal of the Medici from power and their reinstatement by military means around 1530, which resulted in a great famine due to the siege of the city. Against this backdrop, and despite the fact that the architecture is beautifully rendered, the overall impression of the city is too neat and tidy for the era in which the series is set. The streets are wider and more neatly swept than usual at the time. Indeed, it is the ease with which one can say that the graphics are beautiful that clearly reflects the characteristics of the focus on a younger audience. The most striking example for me is the shed where Arte lives. At first it looked like a real drawing, but the renovation made it sterile, neat, precise and thus computer-generated and soulless. What I want to say is that because of the CGI, the viewer&#039;s gaze is focused too much on the surroundings and thus misses what is really important. My criticism corresponds to what Leo-san does with Arte in the third episode. He has her draw the background to a painting several times until she asks why she should draw it over and over again. The explanation is that the background is not the focus of the painting. It&#039;s a portrait, so the person in the picture should actually be the focus. Arte has brought the background to the fore with her expressive painting. I couldn&#039;t have put into words more beautifully and aptly why CGI will never be my cup of tea. To complete the thought, the character designs are simple but very beautiful. The simplicity is especially noticeable in relation to the very pretty and far too accurate and pleasing environment. The character designs do not harmonise much in this environment, although they are the essentials.<br />
In contrast, there is hardly anything to criticise about the animation. The movements are well executed and have a natural posture and flow. I also noticed that movements that take place in the background actually remain in motion. Arte&#039;s market visits can serve as an example here. The people moving in the background are really going in one direction. The backgrounds are rarely a still image, this is not standard and I liked it very much. Unfortunately, even very good animation cannot completely mitigate the shortcomings in the art, but it is a definite plus.<br />
<br />
Sounds: Mixed impression, therefore unfortunately only (6/10)<br />
The music for Arte was composed by Itō, Gorō and bears the signature of the all-rounder. Itō-san is a composer, arranger, guitarist and producer. He has performed as a solo artist and as a member of the bossa nova duo &quot;naomi &amp; goro&quot; in Japan and abroad. He successfully produces his own albums and also writes film scores. Many different styles can be found in Artes&#039; musical arrangements, whereby the cheerfulness of bossa nova as original Brazilian dance music always comes to the fore a little. The spectrum of musical styles used ranges from classical to rock to modern. Some of the music is very soulful, such as Katarīna&#039;s Past &quot;カタリーナの過去&quot;, a beautiful piano solo arrangement, or &quot;Arte Alegret&quot;, classical with full orchestra and a slight emphasis on strings and grand pianos. But also very suitable for the series is the arrangement &quot;In Venice&quot;, for example, which has a gentle touch of medieval music, played by a modern orchestra. The melodies of &quot;Prayer 1 and 2&quot; have, in keeping with the name, a sacred touch. My criticism of the music section relates less to the music itself than to its use. Occasionally I found the BGM to be too intrusive or a little out of place in the scenes, as it either started too abruptly or with an inappropriate time delay. I find it very unfortunate that the basically very appealing music was not used to its advantage.<br />
The Japanese actress and singer Sakamoto, Maaya sings the first OP &quot;Clover&quot;. She has already appeared in many anime and the performance here is also very successful. The title song was kept cheerful, light J-pop, accompanied by an orchestra, similar to Idol songs. Overall, the piano and guitar sound is somewhat in the foreground and the vocals harmonise well with it. Like the background music, it is not exceptional, but well done. As described above for the art, it is easy to say that it is beautiful because it is flawless. It was created to please, but it lacks the idiosyncrasies that generally make art special. <br />
The ED is called &quot;Hare Moyō&quot; and is sung by the Japanese seiyū and singer Yasuno, Kiyono. The arrangement has a beautiful guitar playing as the basic melody and the vocals are beautifully matched to it. A very nice musical arrangement that also stands out from the usual with the orchestra and harp in the background. The animation of the ED is not very fancy, which spoils the overall impression a bit, but that does not detract from the beauty of the music at all.<br />
The dubbing actors for the main characters are very well casted. As always in my reviews, I like to take a closer look at the supporting roles and here, among the male dubbing voices, Fujiwara Mitsuru in particular caught my eye. He has a good voice and pronunciation in relation to the characters portrayed, especially as he speaks two very different roles, Danilo and the Baker. Among the female voices, I particularly liked the soft voice of Daphne, spoken by Tomatsu, Haruka. Her timbre is very pleasantly soft and a little deeper. In keeping with the role, she speaks clearly and somewhat slower. A very beautiful performance.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the production cannot fully present the subject in a mature way. With the implementation for a younger audience and many comedy elements, an imbalance is created with the deep theme of the anime. The result is that a young target group finds most of the series uninteresting, while an older target group finds the presentation of the topics inappropriate and historically incorrect. Regardless of the entertainment value of the series, both target groups are not completely satisfied. That said, I would recommend the anime if someone is looking for fun entertainment and the historical background is of little interest. <br />
<br />
As always, thanks for reading and have fun watching.

    Arte set in a historically inaccurate Italy during the Renaissance this was about a girl, the titular Arte, wanting to defy societies norms and her family and become an artist. Meh kind of forgettable, like I said not very accurate historically with Arte easily overcoming pretty artificial obstacles and not really having to struggle much, catching break after break to the point even the show had the character feel guilty about how easy she had it. Like most Japanese anime set somewhere else, it played out more as how a modern Japanese girl would defy her traditional family and society to strike out on her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345646">
        own than someone from the historical time of the show. Just a thinly veiled scenery change so (the original manga author) could show off their superficial knowledge of Renaissance fashion and architecture. And even though Arte is cute, genki, and has that never give up attitude she also comes off as just a superficial set piece you never really relate to or get invested in, or at least I didn&#039;t.

    Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Let me start off by saying Arte is very much a shoujo anime. It&#039;s not seinen and I wouldn&#039;t call it a romance either. That being said, it&#039;s very cute and I found it extremely easy to watch. I binged the whole thing in a day without getting bored and I liked it a lot (obviously). :)<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
I will concede that this might not be for everyone. The main focus of the show is essentially &quot;Arte wants to be a painter, but men are sexist, so she tries really hard and proves them all wrong.&quot; It&#039;s basic, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a bad thing. If

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381203">
        that sort of storyline bothers you, I wouldn&#039;t watch this show. There are other themes, but the main focus is on feminism and accepting your upbringing/background. Also keep in mind that this is all approached in a very &quot;shoujo&quot; way. The lessons are presented in relatively simple way with simple solutions and nothing especially bad happens. It&#039;s not without nuance, but it can feel like a kids show at times. It&#039;s very bright and cheerful. As for pacing, the show has two halves, and I felt that the second moved a bit too quickly although that didn&#039;t significantly damper my enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
I enjoyed Arte&#039;s character development. She feels like a mix of Shirayuki from Snow White with the Red Hair and Tohru from Fruits Basket. None of the other character&#039;s arcs were as satisfying/fleshed out compared to hers but both Leo and Katarina developed as well. I think the problem as far as character development goes is that Arte had the whole season to grow, but Leo isn&#039;t really in the second half and Katarina isn&#039;t in the first half of episodes.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
<br />
The art and sound match the bright, cheerful nature of the show. It&#039;s all very cute and modern looking. They match the tone of the show, but not necessarily the time period. It&#039;s a very idealized version of the Renaissance. It&#039;s very pretty, but honestly I wasn&#039;t super impressed by Arte or Leo&#039;s artwork. They&#039;re supposed to be amazingly talented but none of the actual artwork in the show stood out to me. <br />
<br />
Overview: <br />
<br />
This is my first review, so I don&#039;t know how helpful it will be (if at all). Overall I liked Arte a lot, but I can recognize that the emphasis on feminism could be seen as too basic or repetitive for some? If you like shoujo about the (somewhat generic) determined female protagonist, you&#039;ll probably like this. I wouldn&#039;t actually call Arte generic; she definitely has a unique personality that enjoyed, but she is similar enough to other shoujo MCs that you know what you&#039;re getting into even before you finish the first episode.

    It&#039;s a sweet historical, typical coming of age story about a few of the difficulties a woman faced. I believe the story is not technically correct and required a lot research into intricate details about Florence and Venice. It has been influenced to a certain extent by da Vinci&#039;s life and works.<br />
<br />
Looking at it from the consideration of an anime, it&#039;s good, but could be better. The insight into Renaissance France/Italy is fancy for people who are unaware, but will be exceedingly boring and at times even blatant contradiction.<br />
<br />
