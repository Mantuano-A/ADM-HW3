    For over a decade now, the anime industry has been producing one series a season that deserves the highly appreciated title of ironic masterpiece. This time around it&#039;s a show about suicidal loli and a massmurderer who refuses to kill her. And it has everything. When I say everything, what I really mean is e v e r y t h i n g, and I have been laughing my butt sore since episode 1. <br />
<br />
Our story starts off in a spooky hospital where security cameras garnish the walls every 3 inches, doors close behind people&#039;s back like it is Ghost Hunt, and possessed typewriters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289601">
        are the ones asking all the questions that matter since our characters don&#039;t even bother trying as they are too busy planning to kill themselves. It&#039;s bad? No, it&#039;s the peak of self-awareness. <br />
<br />
The actual events focus around some floor master shit fights because the entire series is based on a video game that was created with goddamn RPG Maker&#039;s free trial edition. Need a better prove of quality? That&#039;s what I thought. The entire story is real mysterious and apparently everything in it symbolizes some religious nonsense hence why all the 3 different English titles of the show have the word &quot;Angel&quot; in them. Essentially this is lot like Evangelion except fun to watch because the mc only has one mental illness and one of the characters has a pumpkin as a head. <br />
<br />
Our cast is beyond incredible. Rachel is surprisingly non-annoying for a 13 yo child who is in angst (even if her every 3rd line consist of the word &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;me&quot;). Isaac Foster is the perfect representation of a generic horror psychopath from any horror game you play on easy and the murderer is an NPC. He also owns a cool scythe and I laugh similarly as he whenever he does anything. His laugh is real sick, reminds me of Orihara Izaya from Durararararara. +1 for seiyuu work. Daniel Dickens is the best character. I have had a blast using the phrase &quot;the plot Dickens&quot; when ever he does anything. MVP material right there.<br />
<br />
The art is also beyond incredible. Especially the tight and dark spaces really do add to the overall atmosphere. I mentioned Ghost Hunt earlier and that was favorite horror comedy before this one became a thing. The best arc from that anime takes place in a building highly similar to the architecture in which the entire story of Satsuriku no Tenshi takes part in except more floors this time around. Some of the floors really do offer that video game feeling where the series is its own thing and that manages to serve the immersion the work has to offer.<br />
<br />
To me, this Satsuriku no Tenshi offered genuine entertainment. Some of it can be seen to be silly, but I found all of that just add to the overall experience. For example, the dialogue and angst that is best shown in the repetition of the two lines &quot;kill me&quot; and &quot;no&quot; is nothing less than comedic gold, and such lousy cliches as memoryloss were taken exactly as seriouly with this series as they always should be dealt it. Meaning not seriously at all. <br />
<br />
J.C.Staff has been fixing their reputation their best since the Rie Kugumiya&#039;s loli tsundere era, and thus far, Satsuriku no Tenshi is yet another show from them that looks mediocre, but is everything but. Don&#039;t let the criticism ruin the fun as this is what entertainment truly means.

    *I have only watched the anime, not the manga or game. Thus, this review will be based on the anime alone*<br />
<br />
After having completely finished the anime, I can safely say that Satsuriku no Tenshi is one of the most frustrating horror animes I’ve ever watched. From the very start of the show, there have been a myriad of flaws involving plot, dialogue, and character development, all resulting in a trainwreck of a show, which is really a shame because it had such an interesting premise.<br />
<br />
Plot (1/10): The plot to this anime is one of the worst I have ever seen and most of its issues

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289619">
        begin with it’s progression, or rather, the utter lack of it. Right from the beginning and up to halfway through the story, we can see this show following a typical formula: villian shows up -&gt; zack does something stupid -&gt; Rachel finds a solution -&gt; more talking about killing and then not killing. The ‘mystery’ in the show is awfully boring, with the clues being vague and pretentious, constantly talking again and again about ‘sins’ and ‘god’ but adding nothing to the story. Actually that’s the perfect word to describe this shitty show. It’s vague. Really vague. It always felt like it wanted to impress the audience by being ‘intelligent’ so instead of slowly revealing things to the audience (like a good thriller should), it keeps on sprouting ambiguous and often nonsensical details. In my opinion, this show would do better if it was more straightforward so the viewer would get engrossed in the mystery and its progression.<br />
<br />
Another big problem I had with Angels of Death (and probably the most noticeable one) is its repetitive, boring, and edgy dialogue. Basically, it goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Rachel: I want to die. Can you kill me?<br />
Zack: Your expression is boring. I’ll kill you when we get outside.<br />
Rachel: Can you kill me?<br />
Zack: What the hell are you talking about? I said I don’t want to kill you.<br />
<br />
OMG. JUST KILL HER ALREADY!!<br />
<br />
(sorry that was me ranting) All of the dialogue in the story is basically 1) stuff that is really vague 2) stuff we already knew. It’s like it can’t even tell the intelligence of the audience. The whole thing feels like it&#039;s constantly going around in circles, with no meaning or wittiness. We KNOW Rachel wants to die. We KNOW the doc has a crazy eye fetish. Just tell us something important already!!<br />
<br />
Animation (7/10): For a J.C Staff show, the art is surprisingly pretty. It uses a nice color palette and Rachel’s character design was very attractive. Although Zack and the other villains character design do look somewhat generic, I’m willing to give this section a 7.<br />
<br />
Sound (5/10): This department is pretty subjective, but I felt the music in this show to be rather average. It’s not bad, but not very good either. I liked the voice actor for Rachel, but Zack’s voice was straight-up annoying and honestly, I felt like punching his stupid face everytime I hear that voice of his. The villains’ voices also felt extremely annoying, with their over-the-top laughter and eccentric attitudes.<br />
<br />
Character (2/10): Our female protagonist, Rachel, is the only one in the entire cast who didn’t manage to annoy me. That’s not to say she’s a good character though. In the entire anime she was bland and emotionless and lacked any type of character development. Overall, she’s the classic kuudere archetype but nothing to make her interesting. We learn nothing about her throughout the entire story, only that she wants to die. We don’t know why she wants to die, what was accountable for her 180 in the story, or even her backstory.<br />
<br />
The male protagonist Zack isn’t any better, if not worse. Loud, impulsive, and often temperamental, he’s basically your ‘all brawn no brain’ male archetype. He adds nothing to the story, is often very stupid, and is definitely one of the most annoying characters I’ve seen. Not to mention, his ‘tragic backstory’ is one I found to be very generic and a cheap way for viewers to pity him. Overall, it’s not enough to develop his character or make him into a more complex person. Nobody’s expecting an amazing and deep backstory like Kiritsugu’s or even Akashi’s but it’s like this show doesn’t even try. <br />
<br />
The villains were all badly made and were all ‘psychos’ with crazy laughs and no personality. They all want to kill the 2 mc’s but for no reason. They were also involved in some stupid plot twist which brought them back to life even though it was stated that they died.<br />
 <br />
Enjoyment (5/10): I actually enjoyed some parts of the show but most of the time it just felt tedious and uninteresting. Unlike other bad thrillers like mirai nikki or kakegurui, this isn’t very entertaining and is not worth your time.<br />

    Mod Edit: This review was originally written for the final 4 episodes which was previously a separate entry and was subsequently merged into Satsuriku no Tenshi.<br />
<br />
At the time of my writing this, the main page for Angels of Death is sitting at a 6.92, and the top reviews are either negative or not seriously written. However, this was one of the shows I enjoyed most during the Summer 2018 season, so I wanted to write a brief review on its behalf.<br />
<br />
A major contributing factor to these low scores is that people don’t know what to expect from this show. You wouldn’t know this from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292664">
        synopsis above, but Angels of Death isn’t really a horror series – it’s somewhere between a buddy comedy and an otome game, except that all of the suitors want to murder the lead rather than date her (Half of them do still want to date her though). It’s difficult to encapsulate the series in its entirety, but that absurdity is part of the fun.<br />
<br />
It might clear up some details if I talk about the source material that this anime is adapting. Although a manga exists, Angels of Death originally started as a freeware RPG Maker game. If you’ve ever played Yume Nikki or something like it (My personal favorite is Irisu Syndrome, which does have a free English translation), you know that these sorts of games can be surreal experiences, and this adaptation absolutely nails that tone while still poking fun at its genre conventions.  I haven’t played the game myself, but I’ve been told that the plot of the anime diverges, and I’m definitely interested enough to check it out.<br />
<br />
The strength of this series lays in the rapport established between its two leads, Rachel and Zack. The two are an odd couple, but they play off each other really well comically, and it was great to see their dynamic evolve over the course of the show. As they rise through the floors, they go from mutually using each other to actually caring about each other’s wellbeing, and this development is strangely endearing. There was one arc about halfway through the series in which the pair is separated, and those episodes felt empty, but they also made me realize how much I cared about their bond. Despite being a campy horror comedy, Angel of Death’s central relationship is a lot more developed than most anime romances, even if it is founded on murderous intent.<br />
<br />
Angels of Death definitely wasn’t the best show of the Summer 2018 season - its middle section dragged on, and it probably would have helped if it had been cut down to a standard 12 or 13 episodes – but there’s nothing else quite like it and I’m glad I watched it. There’s no other show where characters are as likely to get oddly sentimental about their blades as they are to conduct a trial that wouldn’t be out of place in the Ace Attorney franchise, and it was this emotional range that kept me coming back each week. If any of this mess sounds entertaining to you, then I wholeheartedly recommend you check it out.

    I&#039;ve watched a whole let&#039;s play of the original Indie game. I already know the whole story and what to expect. To those who say the characters are two-dimensional... I can see why you&#039;d think that. I disagree because there is a degree of character development that will become apparent if you stick around long enough. Know too that the story IS that predictable. However you think the story is going to turn out, you&#039;re probably going to be correct in at least one regarded aspect. Despite that, it&#039;s still fun. There&#039;s a certain level of early 2000&#039;s edginess in here. It&#039;s dark, bloody, gritty,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284888">
        and full of psychotic laughter.<br />
<br />
Plot: A young girl named Rachel Gardner wakes up without any memories and finds herself trapped in a building with several floors. She meets the serial killer Isaac Foster who tries to kill her but fails. Later on Rachel no longer wishes to live and asks Isaac if he could kill her. He agrees to kill her as long as she helps him escape the building. So Isaac and Rachel has to try to “beat” all the different floors and find a way to escape.<br />
<br />
If you just simply love horror, this first episode was probably very entertaining and gave you hope for the series.<br />
But if you want dramatic horror with a good story and characters, this episode might have given you some doubts.<br />
<br />
For me it seemed very confusing at first, I had so many questions and it felt like the story wasn’t very well planned and was just supposed to be random and scary. However I was very wrong and I ended up liking the plot and the characters a lot more than I expected. <br />
But as I said, I was very confused in the beginning and had no hope for the story.<br />
Why are they trapped in a building? Who trapped them? Why does the girl want to die all of a sudden? Why do they have to beat these floors?<br />
Everything that seems confusing in the beginning is explained later and the plot is actually very interesting. It is not just a scary horror story. It is progressive and with time it gets more dramatic. <br />
Plus there’s a LOT of character development so I hope they keep it that way in the anime as well.<br />
<br />
Zack (Isaac Foster) the serial killer is not the average crazy aggressive killer who doesn’t care about anyone or anything. Well he is aggressive, crazy and very short tempered but he also becomes a very fun and interesting character which you’ll learn a lot about throughout the story. (He is my favourite character because of his character development)<br />
<br />
Ray (Rachel Gardner) was for me, a very confusing character since I didn’t know why she wanted to end her life so badly. But with time, she shows more of her personality and in the end you find out her story and why she desires death.<br />
<br />
The other characters has very unique personalities and what made me happy was that none of them felt unnecessary. It felt like each and every one of them were needed in some way for the story to be as good as it was. <br />
<br />
The ending was not disappointing and was actually one of my favourite endings of all the rpg maker horror games I’ve played. It left you satisfied and gave a lot of room for your own imagination as to what happens after the ending. <br />
<br />
So in conclusion: If you’re into dramatic psychological horror themes and want a good plot with interesting characters and a lot of character development, this should fit you very well.<br />
I hope this was helpful for anyone having doubts about watching this anime. I hope it turns out well!

    Watching Satsuriku no Tensei (Angels of Death) gave me perhaps one of the strangest impressions of this year. Set in a mysterious building, we immediately meet main female protagonist Rachel Gardner as she is confused about her whereabouts. It doesn’t help that she has no memories except for her name. The show immediately drops viewers into this sort of storytelling out of nowhere and it’s hard to take everything in from the start. Make no mistake. Satsuriku no Tensei is one of those shows where I lost count how many times I rolled my eyes and asked myself just exactly what the hell is going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289614">
        on.<br />
<br />
As the anime is based on a video game, it also does really feel much like playing one. Rachel meets a serial killer named Zack who nearly kills her in the beginning. The show begins to build on its suspenseful plot here onwards as we learn about both characters. An important element of the series is the psychological thriller style of storytelling. The plot can be rather confusing as it sells its ideas through the psychology of the show. With Rachel being in a confused state, she begins to wonder her purpose in the world.<br />
<br />
The main focus is Rachel and throughout the series, she wonders around the floors of this mysterious place with no memories. However, she isn’t too desperate to escape and seemingly has a death wish. She mentions many times throughout the show of her desire to be killed by Zack. In order to accomplish that, she hopes to survive long enough and not get killed by anyone else. The anime presents her personality as being a calm girl with a lack of understanding about morality. She finds it difficult to express human emotions and often says what’s on her mind. It’s also noticeable that Rachel believes in the existence of God. In one particular episode, she declared Zack as her “God”. A behavior like this is far from normal but the show emphasizes on her inhuman-like personality at every chance it gets. However, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Her partner in crime Zack tunes abnormality up to the 11. Known by his full name as Issac “Zack” Foster, the series pushes the envelope to make him a serial killer. He has actually been involved in previous murder cases before and the show explores some of his past through flashbacks. If you’ve seen his personality, then Zack would definitely be someone you hope to never run into in some dark alleyway. For his personality, Zack is bluntly rude and often uses foul language. He isn’t very intelligent either and between the two, he is more of the muscle while Rachel has the brains. However, there’s no doubt that Zack is mentally unstable and has survivalist instincts. The cause of his mentality is not exactly known and this feels more like a flaw of the show. The creators wants the audience to basically accept Zack for who he is without really getting us to understand him. In essence, I see Zack as a monster despite his alliance with Rachel. He’s the type of guy that gets the thrill of killing without any true reason. However, Rachel does bring out some human-like emotions out of him when the duo are together. As odd as it seems, they are like two peas in a pod that are inseparable.<br />
<br />
The show features a variety of characters with Zack and Rachel finding that out the hard way as they navigate through various floors. It really does feel like a role playing RPG and the more I watched this series, the more I felt compelled to see what events await them. Unfortunately, I can’t really express satisfaction at the characters they encounter on their dark adventure. It seems the show tries to make its entire character as inhuman as possible. First, we got Daniel Dickens, an insane doctor who has an unhealthy obsession for Rachel’s eyes. Then, there’s Eddie, a boy who wears a mask and is in love with making graves. Cathy is introduced as a floor master and someone I’d describe as sadistic. She enjoys toying with others and inflict punishment for her own pleasure. Finally, there’s Gray, a religious priest who loves to pass judgement on others. His actions in the show should be condemned as sinful as he attempts to burn Rachel alive at a stake. It feels like the creator wanted the viewers to hate these characters as much as possible. And if that was the intention, it succeeded. These supporting characters also feel like video game bosses as they are the main obstacle for Rachel and Zack to overcome. <br />
<br />
So what now? Does Satsuriki no Tensei really work as an anime? Or does it fail like a half-polished video game filled with bugs that needs fixing? Honestly, I think it’s a bit of both for the main TV series. I mention this because there are still 4 episodes left to debut in home release format. With 12 episodes, the show is incomplete without a proper conclusion. I have not played the game before but there have been some games I’ve played that resembles this show. Games like The Evil Within reminds me of this series as it adheres to psychological horror and thriller. The downside is that I never did once get scared in this show because it’s hardly any scary. Instead, the more accurate representation is more of a psychological thriller. The anime explores the human psyche as we see how these characters behave in unusual circumstances.<br />
<br />
Adapted by J.C. Staff, you can easily tell that they were aiming for a dark and grimy setting. The uneasy feeling of the abandoned building and atmospheric feeling never leaves the show throughout the duration of its run. It paints the feeling of being trapped like a rat. Character designs in the series represent a creative style with our two main characters. First, there’s Rachel with her petite stature and blonde hair. She wears a stripped shirt with a white sweater complete with black boots. In many ways, she actually looks rather normal although her character expressions are often devoid of feelings. On the other hand, Zack has the look of a homicidal maniac. Compared to Rachel, he is much taller and wears a hoodie. His signature weapon is a scythe that almost represents him as a living reaper. His character expressions throughout the series is malicious and he is known to break out of insane laughter from time to time. The other characters in this series are decorated with abnormal traits such as Daniel’s freakish eyes, Eddie’s burlap mask, or Gray’s religious attire. The fact is, the creators definitely put their thought into making these characters distinctive as possible.<br />
<br />
As a psychological thriller, expect an eerie OST that’s often quiet to bring an unsettling mood. Indeed, the mood of the show is often eerie even during some of the action segments. There are many moments when the music really amps up to make viewers feel like as if they are with them. Similarly, the theme songs contain cryptic lyrics that ceases every moment to make the show as uncomfortable as possible. Finally, I have to give praise to the voice talent in this series. Characters like Rachel and Zack are able to bring their characters fully to life despite their complex personalities. It’s not easy to step into the shoes of an emotionless character like Rachel but I fully embraced her role if judging by her voice. Zack is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto who is well known for his role as Accelerator from the Index franchise. From this series, he displays his full talent to bring out Zack’s personality to a menacing degree.<br />
<br />
There’s a lot more to be said about Satsuriku no Tensei but for its TV airing, the show is more of a base game. I’d treat the reminding episode as DLC content to fully explore the story and give this anime a proper ending. Regardless, this show is not easily recommendable to anyone as the unusual style of storytelling will be difficult to get used to. It’s sometimes not faint for the heart either if you’re not comfortable with watching murder scenes. It almost feels like the creators are trying to get in our heads to see what we&#039;re thinking. I would say that giving this show is more suited for thrill seekers or those who watch this like playing a video game.

    &quot;Don&#039;t take story ideas from 12 yr olds, or at least those who have the mental capacity of a 12 yr old.&quot;<br />
<br />
The synopsis itself is promising, and in the hand of another writer there could&#039;ve been a great story. But sadly, it just wasn&#039;t to be. Unlikable characters, predictable plot, lack of gore for something that&#039;s supposed to be scary, horrible dialogue and the worst jokes I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime all contribute towards making this piece of shit the piece of shit it is.<br />
 <br />
These reasons all contribute towards my hate for this anime, but for me the most infuriating part about this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285138">
        anime is how it treats it&#039;s viewers like retarded pieces of shit. WE DON&#039;T NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT RACHEL WANTS TO DIE! we knew that from the first episode, stop reminding us every 5 seconds. This is probably also the reason some people like it, since their brains can&#039;t really keep up with something more complicated than whatever a monkey with a typewriter can make. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And now, we get a little more in depth with the anime (some spoilers i guess):<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Pure shit. nothing more. <br />
The story itself is really simple, Rachel wakes up suffering from amnesia, she doesn&#039;t remember how she got there, and then suddenly encounters our great villain/secondary protagonist Zack. He chases her around for a bit, but once she regains her soulless eyes he suddenly doesn&#039;t want to kill her. Then our lovely characters go through an adventure through each floor, encountering other stereotypical villains on their way to escape. The dialogue during the 2nd episode was really bad, there was also a scene where Zack asks her why she doesn&#039;t kill herself and her reply is &quot;because god says it&#039;s bad&quot;(god or religion will probably become really important later on, what a surprise). Then on the 3rd episode the murderous child offers to kill Rachel the soulless husk, but she denies because Zack swore to god that he&#039;ll kill her I guess?? Which makes me wonder, if she wants to die so much that she has withdrawal symptoms if she doesn&#039;t mention it every minute (during the 3rd episode she mentions or implies that she wants to die 8 fucking times), why didn&#039;t she take his offer?<br />
<br />
I basically skimmed through the 4th episode, so I can&#039;t really criticize anything. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Good. The best part about it.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
OK. <br />
I know some people find Zack&#039;s laugh annoying, but it doesn&#039;t really bother me and the voice acting is alright. If had any criticisms it would be the lack of atmospheric music. you sometimes need it.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Absolute dog shit, we never have any reason behind any of the villains actions other than &quot;hurr durr I&#039;m evil&quot;, Rachel is an unlikable soulless piece of shit and Zack is sorta alright I guess.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I only sorta enjoyed the first episode, the rest made my blood boil.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
It&#039;s shit, don&#039;t watch it.

    So Angels of death used to say it had 16 episodes but they changed it to 12 and the rest are being released as videos. (is what I heard)<br />
<br />
Anyways beside that Angels of Death was really just okay. Doesn&#039;t really do anything special so it&#039;s just kinda average. Although I have my score as an 8 because really I did enjoy it. <br />
<br />
The show has revolves around Rachel and Zack trying to get out of this building they&#039;re in and leave. They start at the bottom floor and just work their way up battling floor masters along the way. Each floor master having their own

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289616">
        weird interest in Rachel which gets weird and annoying fast. Not the battle themselves I think the floor master battles are interesting for the most part but it&#039;s the over excessive importance and obsession with Rachel which just gets annoying but again another one of my personal problems with the show. <br />
<br />
I think if you&#039;re just looking for a fun, fighting, edgy, and crazy show to watch then this show may not be the best choice as they&#039;re way more better ones out their but this one is also good if you already seen the other type of shows like this. <br />
<br />
Overall honestly was fun I really only liked Zack and that dude with the peanut like mask but that&#039;s not to say the other characters were bad though. Had a good time watching this and I think you will too.<br />

    Satsuriku no Tenshi, or Angels of Death, was one of my most hyped and anticipated shows of the Summer season, because I have heard good things about the game that it originates from and its manga adaptation which replicates the game quite nicely. And now, the arrival of the anime adaptation of both the game and the manga...and its overall quality couldn&#039;t be more justified than just following the narratives of the game, so much so that I went to play the game and it certainly holds that into regard.<br />
<br />
The story may just be your standard horror-adventure genre narration, but it has more substance than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284882">
        that. We follow 13-year-old Rachel &quot;Ray&quot; Gardner in her quest as she was taken into a basement for a counselling from witnessing murder in the face, that she wasn&#039;t meant to be there in the first place, and now is looking for means to escape and find her parents. It is there that she meets Isaac &quot;Zack&quot; Foster, a grim-reaper-looking bandaged man who is as mad as a serialist mass-murderer with a scythe, and in the process, tries to escape Zack by escaping to Basement 5, but gets messed up with her counsellor Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Dickens for trying to encapsulate her colourful eyes, before being slain by Zack, and now both labelled as violators of the &quot;escape game&quot; and together they make their way up, working their own solutions and helping one another to stay out of harm&#039;s way.<br />
<br />
So from the get-go, for people whom have either played the game or read the manga equivalent of the adaptation, I can say with certainty that you are definitely not disappointed with the exposition from the writing and pacing of the show. For anime-onlys however, this might be way too confusing to deal with at first, but the pacing progressively helps bring the core of the show along with it. It&#039;s tough but it&#039;s doable.<br />
<br />
Character-wise, Rachel and Isaac both are like horrors within themselves, with Rachel&#039;s constant wish for someone to kill her because of the nightmare that she went through, and now with the juxtaposition that her life has been one of dread and emotionless feels, so much so that she is displayed by her emotionless self, and Isaac being the M equivalent of a grim reaper feeling, that he cares for nothing but people&#039;s deaths upon his hands. And speaking of the VAs for both MCs, Rachel&#039;s VA might be a bit of an unknown (Haruga Chisuka, Akatsuki no Yona&#039;s Ki-ja, Owari no Seraph&#039;s Mikaela) but you sure as hell will know Isaac&#039;s VA (it&#039;s VERY obvious who he is but if you don&#039;t, it&#039;s HeroAca&#039;s Deku&#039;s buddy rival Bakugo), greatly love the emotions that both VAs bring towards their characters.<br />
<br />
Art-and-animation wise, of the J.C.Staff shows airing this season, this show has the best-looking and animation views of the surroundings, from the various floors of different expositions of the basement floor bosses personalities to the adventure-thriller-driven emotions of the characters. With that said, the quality unfortunately had to be cut out in certain spots (because it&#039;s public TV), but for the most part it holds and retains its source well.<br />
<br />
The music is one area where to me it is very divisive. For the most part, Massaki Endou&#039;s OP was somewhat strange because of the mostly-shounen feels (he has done YuGiOh and Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar), but I I don&#039;t see that being justifiable for me yet. On the other hand, I absolutely love and adore the ED by Rachel&#039;s VA, that it got me hooked and dropping tears with the game in mind, it evoked the right sense of foreboding and emotions that toy the feels, So overall, ED &gt; OP.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is one of the good shows of the Summer season, and I know some people just couldn&#039;t be afforded with the copious amounts of horror-adventure that just feels laid down and such. But if this is your thing, go ahead and watch this show, it&#039;s not a masterpiece but it&#039;s certainly a good watch.

    I gotta say, four episodes in and I am enthralled by the story... Heck, it&#039;s pilot even created a compelling storyline that I&#039;d hate to miss.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
It sets the scene whereby the MC (I guess she&#039;s the MC) follows a progressive plot through, what I&#039;d refer to as levels -I say levels since her &quot;spawn point&quot; is a basement from which she must navigate to go up a floor.<br />
-<br />
This is affirmed by it&#039;s most recent episode.<br />
-<br />
Furthermore, it is a level because she has to escape what could potentially be her cause of death...<br />
But that&#039;s not what got me into it, rather -straight off the bar-

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284891">
        it had incorporated psychological elements that can only be further elaborated with each episode; this created the foundation for mental growth of the characters. But that&#039;s not all of what it would seem to be; whilst maintaining the theme of &quot;levels,&quot; it was quick to throw a wrench into the works and the dynamics of the anime had become growingly distorted -much of that distortion contributed to the already ambiguous storyline given... However this gave a sense of closure to the MCs story which made me think, &quot;seriously, you&#039;re gonna end it here!&quot;<br />
I mean, it obviously didn&#039;t, but if they had allowed the protagonist to continue this devilish game allow for at least one and a half episodes would have more benefits to it than consequences; anyway, since it&#039;s only been three episode it&#039;s not done much harm either so... Meh.<br />
So, the reason why I rated the characters rather lowly in comparison to the other aspects of the anime is because they felt a bit lacklustre and fell flat in terms of depth... Due to its game-like progression, each character is given a specific role and does not display behaviour out of it&#039;s role; whilst I say this, there have been implications of dark secrets that each character carries -in my opinion, this is extremely suggestive of a more rounded character which we may learn of in future episodes.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
So, for the story, it&#039;s built up quite nicely I would say; It gave us a good understanding of the story mechanics -or the mechanics that they want us to know (plot twists are fully welcome).<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Art, I gotta hand it to JC, they know how to make it work and with this anime, no less. I&#039;ve not seen the source material so I&#039;ve nothing to compare it to, but considering other anime e.g. Shokugeki no souma etc. it seems to be fairly consistent.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Keeping true to the psychological/thriller genre, the suspense music doesn&#039;t fail to deliver... It was captivating and had sucked me in; I had become wary of what was to come, and that had inevitably heightened my reactions, making me vulnerable to being startled.<br />
Moreover, we have bakugou&#039;s (Boku no hero academia) VA (okamoto nobuhiko) filling one of the characters positions, which to me, is a massive bonus as his voice has a tendency to act as a form of comic relief -and when considering the darker tropes this series seems to be adhering to, I feel that having such a voice actor will strike a balance to an anime akin to a seinen. But time will tell.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
In conclusion, this anime had created an awesome opening guaranteed to pique the interest of further viewing for anyone that sits down to watch the beginning.<br />
<br />
Edit*<br />
I just found out that the source material is a game haha😂. An&#039; here I was goin&#039; on about levels... I guess Ima go play this game now (if possible😅).<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
This review had been written during the pilot episode but is still relevant to all the aired episodes thus far.<br />

    Mod Edit: This review was originally written for the final 4 episodes which was previously a separate entry and was subsequently merged into Satsuriku no Tenshi.<br />
<br />
Please note, this includes the series and the ONA.<br />
<br />
This horror anime month has been pretty middling in terms of the series we&#039;ve looked at. We&#039;ve seen some decent anime and some sub-par anime. We haven&#039;t seen anything great but we haven&#039;t seen anything terrible either. Maybe we&#039;ll be able to break up that pattern with a look at Satsuriko no Tenshi, an anime based off of a horror game. Now, your first thought when I mention anime based off of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321024">
        a horror game might be my history with trite rubbish like Galerians or Corpse Party. But at least those two were entertaining in their incompetence. And we have reviewed some good anime based off of games. Maybe this will be one of those. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open with our heroine, young Rachel Gardner, waking in a strange place where she&#039;s chosen as a sacrifice. She quickly discovers that she&#039;s going to have to go up through several floors of serial killers to escape the complex. Wanting to die, she approaches one, Isaac Foster, who agrees to kill her after she helps him escape. <br />
<br />
There are two fatal flaws with this narrative. The first is that the story makes very little sense when you think about it to even the slightest degree. First of all, how did the dude who set all this up find all these serial killers and how did he get them to actually agree to all live in this system and work together? Serial killers all have their own shtick. They have certain things they look for in their victims, specific ways they want to murder said victims and they generally don&#039;t work well together. How did he persuade them all to work together with rules about who gets what floor? How does he find &quot;sacrifices&quot; who work for all of them? And how did he manage to build this vast complex to house all these killers with no one noticing? This premise is objectively stupid. <br />
<br />
But let&#039;s put that aside for a moment. Let&#039;s pretend that either our brains don&#039;t quite work properly or we&#039;re really willing to stretch suspension of disbelief and let&#039;s talk about the second fatal flaw. Mainly, there&#039;s no possible tension to this scenario. One of our protagonists is openly and unapologetically a mass murderer with no redeeming qualities. There is no compelling reason for us to give the remotest shit what happens to him. Our other protagonist wants to die. You&#039;d think that would be easy in a complex full of serial killers, but she decides it has to be this one guy who does it for very insipid reasons. There&#039;s no reason for us to care about her survival because she doesn&#039;t even care about her own survival. Therefore, any dangerous scenario they find themselves in doesn&#039;t matter. <br />
<br />
And it is pretty stupid that she&#039;s in a complex of murderers and can&#039;t figure out how to get herself killed. That would be like going to a university frat party and not being able to figure out how to get laid. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters in this do not help. Isaac is obnoxiously stupid. Rachel is an insipid nothing character. And the killers they encounter on each floor are just a bunch of stereotypes out off old, cheesy slasher films. Roger Corman&#039;s horror films had more menacing adversaries than these morons. It doesn&#039;t help that the interactions among the characters are really dumb. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
There are moments where you can see how a floor&#039;s design might be a bit creepy, if the execution was very different. That&#039;s about the most positive thing I can say for the artwork. The character designs are pretty stupid looking. Isaac wears bandages all across his face, including over his mouth, but he somehow left enough of a hole that he can talk and open his mouth in spite of the bandages being clearly placed on his lips. <br />
<br />
The action sequences aren&#039;t very good either. They&#039;re a bit slow-paced and dull. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The acting is not as bad as every other element in the series would lead you to believe. You can tell that Okamoto Nobuhiko, Sakurai Takahiro and some others have skill. The problem is that their performances in this range from stilted to not giving a shit. The music is fairly mediocre. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t any in this series. The character dynamics are too boring to have romantic tension of any kind, really. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
Have one serial killer who puts their victims at the bottom of a trap-riddled complex as their thing. If there was one mastermind and you barely saw them, it would have a much stronger, actually creepy atmosphere. As opposed to a bunch of one note idiots on different floors.<br />
Have a protagonist who has a personality and wants to live. It&#039;s much easier to care about a character with a personality and be invested when they themselves care. Honestly, I&#039;d have ten characters at the start and show them all going through the floors individually. IE, starting with the first floor and then showing the people who survive that going through the next and so on. The audience would always be curious as to which characters would make it through a particular floor. <br />
Have strong character designs. The characters in this are basically built around taking some horror monster/ slasher like a mummy, scarecrow, mad scientist, warden or priest and making them look really stupid. You would do better just having the antagonist be a somewhat sketchy looking person. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Satsuriku no Tenshi is pretty awful. And not in an entertaining way like Corpse Party or Galerians. The narrative has massive holes. The characters are rubbish. The designs are stupid looking. It&#039;s just genuinely terrible. I&#039;m giving it a 2/10.

    Mod Edit: This review was originally written for the final 4 episodes which was previously a separate entry and was subsequently merged into Satsuriku no Tenshi.<br />
<br />
Satsuriku no Tenshi was a good anime <br />
It&#039;s a good and honest adaptation of the game. <br />
<br />
Ok first, we gonna talk about the story (6):<br />
<br />
A young girl wakes up in a unknown basement and tries to escape it, the second floor&#039;s resident tries to kill her and she escapes from death. Finally, the murderer should ally with the protagonist, who wishes to die from him. They met other murderer and finally escapes the basement, with a lot of injuries. For

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292716">
        saving the protagonist&#039;s life and kill her later, the 2nd floor&#039;s murderer accept to go to jail. Satsuriku no Tenshi ends with a cliffhanger, the murderer escapes from his jail and kills the psychiatric doctor of the protagonist, they met and... Nothing. just a sentence, which is the name of the last episode &quot;Well stop crying and smile&quot;.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not really original, but i liked the idea of a giant and incognito basement and of the murderer who&#039;s too stupid to survive alone. Not original, but still cool. Some scenes aren&#039;t really pertinent in an anime, but we can easily see the prints of his video game inspiration.<br />
I was really disappointed by the final episode, and i was really angry afterview.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s talk about the art (7):<br />
<br />
<br />
I liked how is designed Satsuriku no Tenshi. Well, yes, it has some bad points, but i liked the chara designs, i liked the backgrounds. It&#039;s only my mind, i don&#039;t think that you&#039;ll have the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Third, the sounds (9):<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh god were can i begin.<br />
Vital (OP) is a good song, PraY (ED) too, and the OSTs gives us a lot of sensations. I really loved it, and i&#039;m really sad. Sad because i didn&#039;t find them on youtube or others plateforms.<br />
<br />
Now, the characters (7):<br />
<br />
Rachel Gardner (4) : <br />
She&#039;s an original kind of characters. Intelligent, unexpressive, i liked how she is. But we learn too late her past, and i think it&#039;s why i didn&#039;t really care about her.<br />
<br />
Isaac Foster (8):<br />
Well, i liked Zack. Is past with the old blind man was really touching, his conditions of murderer and honest guy make him a polyvalent character, and that&#039;s what&#039;s make him an excellent character.<br />
<br />
Eddie (3):<br />
He was just the little guy who loves Rachel and made a grave for her. His talent of furtivity in the darkness was kind of interesting, but that&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
Cathie (2):<br />
Just a sadistic character and that&#039;s all. She was stupid as hell.<br />
<br />
Danny (7):<br />
I didn&#039;t really know what to think about him, he&#039;s just crazy. But with his relation with Rachel, i tough he was pedophile. I don&#039;t know if he is, but he seems to be like that. From the last episodes, he had a good developement and that&#039;s why i give him 7.<br />
<br />
Gray (10):<br />
I know nothing about this priest, and that&#039;s why i love him. he&#039;s mysterious and isn&#039;t an enemy or an ally of Rachel. I&#039;m dissapointed about the fact that we don&#039;t know a thing about their relationship, but i have some hope for an OVA.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally, my enjoyment (7)<br />
<br />
I liked the first episodes, but since the 9th, i started to be disappointed, even if i liked to see the evolution of the characters.<br />

Overall&#039;s personnal rate: 7<br />

    As someone who&#039;d played the game and read the manga version of this series, I only have one advice for you: treat this anime like a love story. And also, it will get a lot better and those of you who&#039;re complaining about the lack of characterization... well, the amount of character development later on will overwhelm you to the point of suffocation.<br />
<br />
Story 8: The only reason I gave it a 8 is that the production team didn&#039;t include Eddie and Danny&#039;s backstory. If they did, I don&#039;t think so many people would be shitting on this anime at the moment. Also I feel that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284901">
        the anime changed this part too much. Zack was supposed to be gritting his teeth refusing to scream out in the beginning but slowly losing his control the more electricity he went through. The way the anime made him scream the entire part starts to irritate me after a while. And certain parts are dragged out too much. Other than that, the anime&#039;s following the game/manga plotline perfectly. I&#039;m truly excited to see certain scenes animated. This story is THE best love story I&#039;d ever read. The character interaction later on in the plot actually brought a tear to my eyes. And if you think it&#039;s predictable now? Well, try and predict the later plot then. Pff.<br />
<br />
Art 9: Making a crappy RPG game character design into something this magnificent. How can you give it any less? Those who thinks Zack&#039;s design is stereotypical? He has his reasons. The only reason I didn&#039;t give it a ten was that I like the way Zack&#039;s face was drawn in the manga more than in the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound 9: Love the voice actors. Zack, Ray, Eddie, Cathy... suits them perfectly. Spot on. No complaints. BGM can&#039;t be more fitting.<br />
<br />
Character 9: It&#039;s a nine cuz some character backstories are cut out, making them kind of bland (when theybreally aren&#039;t). Those who complains about shitty writing and lack of characterization for Ray? Keep watching. It&#039;ll prove you wrong. Ray is one of the deepest main character I&#039;ve seen (partially because most of her characterization is related to religion and I&#039;m an atheist so all those religion stuff she&#039;s saying is pretty confusing to me). And you&#039;ll understand later on why she wants to kill herself. Zack too isn&#039;t a one-dimensional psychopath wanting to kill. His story goes deeper than that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9: the fact that I anticipate this anime more than my current number 1 fav My Hero Academia&#039;s update shows just how much I&#039;m enjoying this series. Would enjoy it a lot more if it followed the manga down to a tee.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9 Cannot wait for the bang scene. And the bang bang bang in the end ;-) gamer you know what I&#039;m talking about.<br />

    My mother always said if you don&#039;t anything nice to say about someone, don&#039;t say anything at all. Thankfully, this nightmare (and not the scarey kind, ironically) isn&#039;t a person.<br />
<br />
The summary is a cookie cutout of a typical mystery archetype / story setting. The amnesiac in a strange place. Then there&#039;s the weird anime twists with a murder with a scythe who laughs like a popcorn machine with a fork in it. Anyways, nothing overtly special or any red flags in the summary. Except for maybe that stupid little bit about fate. Doubt fate locked you in a building. Moving on. Why it&#039;s bad.<br />
<br />
The mystery

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289734">
        as shown in the summary / template isn&#039;t anything inherently special. The story writer, the original author or whoever had most input in the anime clearly didn&#039;t do anything to improve on that lack of specialty. Nothing interesting or unpredictable happened. In fact it&#039;s was the exact opposite. Entirely predictable and boring. Something that kinda shouldn&#039;t happen in a mystery horror. The dialogue, events and motivations of characters are tragic. And not in the Romeo and Juliet sense. Mystery isn&#039;t an excuse for poor character building, and lack of background knowledge. The procedural, unchanging a repetitive events that last 2 - 4 episodes which only difference from the last arc is a new murderer on a new floor. The shoe horned, poorly thought out religious malformed mutations that embodies every stereotypical and unconvincing religious standpoint or assertion didn&#039;t help improve the series either. Lastly, the unsurprising, unoriginal and boring ending didn&#039;t improve upon any of the incredibly low bows this series set.<br />
<br />
Each floor&#039;s murder was uninteresting to say the least. Not ideal for a psychopathic killer in a building of psychopathic murderers. The only difference in their quality or interest to the main characters is due to their lack of presence in the overall story. Which ironically is a good thing. They were already glaringly hypocritical, illogical and or inconsistent. The lack of empathy, fear or genuine interest they inspired would only be compounded by a continued presence. If you switched the names, orders, faces, stories or anything you really want about them, it&#039;d have essentially zero significant impact on the story. The only truly impactful side character is the priest, and his impact is just as rooted in illogical fallacy as are the actions and beliefs of Rachel, the moving doll who&#039;s only redeeming feature is she doesn&#039;t talk or make as much noise as Zack. The more I see of the dynamic duo of dipshits known as our main characters the more problems I have. Completely uninteresting, unoriginal, unchanging cookie cutter archetype side characters are better than completely uninteresting, unchanging, illogical and irritating main characters. Zack is irritating to say the least. He&#039;s exactly what&#039;d you expect a teenager would imagine a teenage murderer to be. He, like all of the characters, is uninteresting and has little originality. Aside from his backstory, which is neither good nor exceptionally bad, he lacks depth and personality or change. It&#039;s like someone took Jason and animified him. Rachel on the other hand has literally had no personality. There was nothing interesting about her, her backstory or her actions. She&#039;s inconsistent and illogical. Wants to die, but suicide is wrong. Killing people? Eh whatever. Oh this psychopathic murderer will kill me if I help him? Perfect. No problems. This other psychopathic murderer will kill me? Nope. No good, the first one already promised god. Her fundamental perception and practice of religion is insulting even to me as a non believer, I can only imagine how irritating it&#039;d be an actual respectable theologian, not that bad stereotype of a Messiah complex evil priest.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even need to say anything about the voice acting. Zack&#039;s voice and laughing makes me want to gouge out my ears with a pair of chopsticks. It&#039;s not intimidating or scary. If I heard that in the dark I wouldn&#039;t run for the hills. I&#039;d tell the fucker to shut up and cut out his vocal cords if he tried to kill me with his gardening tools. Not exactly what a murderer&#039;s &#039;evil laugh&#039; should inspire. Rachel&#039;s entire personality was nothing. Flat, emotionless and unchanging. Guess having no standards is one way to avoid criticism. <br />
I&#039;ve seriously seen characters who don&#039;t talk AT ALL that have better voice acting than Rachel. High Score Girl&#039;s Oono is a perfect example. More emotion is conveyed in essentially coughs, grunts and literally no words than any and every word Rachel uttered. As for music. Everyone knows music is a key part of horror and suspense. Doesn&#039;t hurt mystery either. This anime lacked any suspense and the lack of good music certainly contributed to that lack of suspense. A pathetic and easy to avoid failure on this anime&#039;s part that would have greatly contributed to the overall story.<br />
<br />
It was entirely too hard for me to find any enjoyment in a story devoid of consistency or logic but with plenty of plot armor. Blood loss apparently doesn&#039;t exist in this world.<br />
The repetitive story, background and general events, lack of atmosphere and good music, and pathetic characters and character past &amp; building. Then religion, an incredibly difficult topic to discuss seriously, being portrayed in such a laughable and contemptible manner compounded the irritating nature of the series and just stacked up on top of the other glaring issues of the series.<br />
<br />
This show is a fools idea of good mystery and a child&#039;s idea of a good horror anime. It&#039;s basically what you&#039;d get if you asked for a fanfiction of Beauty and the Beast from a weaboo. There&#039;s not much to say. It&#039;s bad. I could go on and on, put in more effort, but this show is just so comically and unapologetically bad, I don&#039;t feel it deserves anymore effort. Unless you like everything from ebola to retardation in physical form, such as the Paul brothers, don&#039;t watch this. It&#039;s not worth the time, energy or brain cells. It&#039;s the worst show to air this season. Maybe even this year. The only happiness I got from this series is when I found out it was 12 episodes instead of 16.<br />

    * An analysis of the plot and characters until the first five episodes. *<br />
<br />
Satsuriku no Tenshi is one of the animes managed to have more relevance this season for two reasons: for its duo of protagonists and because the season is loose, a season that only offers two sequels and more reasons to reaffirm how bad the modern anime is, for less innovative than to say it. <br />
Although the synopsis is already screaming at my ear that it is not going to be something specifically innovative to be of the genre and that starts strong using mediocre resources like misfortunes that happen because if or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286012">
        situations with ridiculous backgrounds like the tests to which they are subjected, resources with Equally mediocre justifications, I have not seen works of this kind for a long time, so I can have sensations of amazement or who knows. <br />
<br />
The story is easy to follow because it shows what is just and necessary, and implies that there are things to explain at another time better known as narrative shortcuts, not because it is the beginning but much of what can be said about the story is in the premise, is based on a problem and knowing how to conclude this, by the characteristics the strong point should be in<br />
Characters. <br />
Whether or not interesting, they are 100% junk, it starts with a girl, Rachel Gardner who is supposed to be a normal person in an abnormal situation and is confused, well, it seems logical, there is a pseudo-killer who &quot;tries&quot; kill her but it has a strange fetish with facial expressions or something I managed to understand and the disinterest in living that arises in Rachel makes them end up forming a duo with the plan to escape, well. Other characters appear who are crazy or do not act at all normal with the aim of killing, or a peculiar definition of killing since everything revolves around death, these only serve as an obstacle, another reason to pay attention to those of the promise, that&#039;s their way of being within the psychological genre, with crazy people, good. <br />
Nobody can deny that &quot;promise&quot; of Rachel and Isaac is totally absurd, it makes sense until the part in which the two get what they want, but going back to the drastic change that arose in the protagonist, I thought that she was going to be the only thing that could be rescued from this anime, an exceptional principal but no, the best reaction he had was to become the lowest example of the Kuudere stereotype, only to be able to fit the context, perfect. So, up to this point the only moderately interesting thing to see is how the relationship between these two develops, I only want to know what excuse they are going to put so that in some way they empathize and end up all happy after so many misfits and whatever wait, although another less positive conclusion is equally possible but I always follow the basic prediction, I know it as the last resort; put romance because it always works to get attention. <br />
<br />
It seems that he tries with a doubtful effort to be what he is, an Anime of Horror, psychological, thriller, but I do not think he achieves it at all, it seems only an excuse to show blood and problems. The environment, the situation or the places are well worked although sometimes it has too much resemblance to the world of a videogame, with the armed scenarios and other things that can make it meaningless to be brought from the mechanics of a videogame. <br />
<br />
I never liked RPGs, most of those who have tried their game I guess they like this adaptation, but I think the correct thing is to see it as two different things and that none influence the other. <br />
<br />
I thought I would have more things to say about this, but the few things that this anime offered so far, added the disinterest and the little attention with which I saw the first five episodes left me saying obvious things and repeating ideas, I hope to see how continues this work, very unattractive, many stupid things that degrade the little that has quality, and a perfect opportunity to create fanarts of the alleged relationship and nothing, I just wanted to write about anime and just this had the wrapping.<br />
<br />
If you noticed a misspelling, a badly constructed sentence, or if the review seemed like trash, keep in mind that it was translated from Spanish to English with little grace, thanks for reading.

    Mod Edit: This review was originally written for the final 4 episodes which was previously a separate entry and was subsequently merged into Satsuriku no Tenshi.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d never understand as to why studio JC Staff decided to split this anime into a 2 part thing where the 1st 12 episodes were left as unfinish and end it with a 4 episode ONA. They could have just included the last episodes on a regular airing schedule, that splitting this up to a 2 part series.......But , enough of that, so what we have here were the last 4 episodes of the parent anime, and quite frankly, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292653">
        was good but not good enough when we see Danny the main antagonist  coming back to life after being killed by Zack in the 1st episode and other episodes that came with this ONA, in fact in the 1st episode of the parent anime he was SUPPOSE TO BE DEAD!!!!!!! . I were the director and original creator of this series, I would have had 3 Danny&#039;s whom have the same level of mental insanity whom were just loitering around, as one danny get&#039;s killed another one takes his place or I could have had that Priest Abraham Gray be the next killer in the series that both Zack and Ray should have faced. Now storywise, the plot was simple as it is cu&#039;z it simply involves 2 lesser killers whom were wanting to get outta the dungeon that was full of the most insane and over the top psycho killers that start with a mad doctor Danny, to a insane delinquent Mason Edwards  and last a crazy bitch Catherine Ward or at least on the 1st part of the anime . Cu&#039;z it was just as crazy when the director Original creator and produces , decides to bring back Danny instead of making the 2 face off with the priest Abraham . What&#039;s crazy was how crazy did the original creator, Nazuka Kudan, conceptualize some shit like this of having Danny resurrected from the dead 3 times in a row . On the character category, was see Zack being this serial killer who was a combination of Hannibal Lecter and Freddy Krueger , while Rachel Gardner was more like a damsel in distress that has a skeleton in her closet, but the turn off here was how the story plot rely on Danny in being this antagonist that keeps coming back and why they didn&#039;t utilize the priest to be the last antagonist. Well, anyways the anime has ended in a sour note when we&#039;re given an open ending that were left to use adudence  as how it ended, cu&#039;z the scenario  as to what happened to Zack and Ray after they met again have a lotta holes and conflict, som how do I rate this??????Here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story-Fair 6: Cu&#039;z one part of me finds it good , but another part of me finds it annoying as to how this ended. <br />
<br />
Art-Mediocre 5: Since it was still connected to the parent anime.<br />
<br />
Sound- Mediocre 5:Since it was still connected to the parent anime. <br />
<br />
Character-Poor 3: I really hated as how how they keep on relying on Danny to be this ultimate antagonist , since he keep coming back from the dead, when HE&#039;s SUPPOSE TO BE DEAD!!!!!!! And how Zack and Ray end came to an open and complicated ending.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- poor 3: Cu&#039;z for this to be 4 episode long was just too much of a waste of time, when  this could have been just 2 episodes short. <br />
<br />
Overall-Poor 3: Has a lotta complications and holes, original creator and director were a bunch of crazies and so as Studio JC Staff. <br />
<br />
BOOM!!!!!!! (Mic drop )   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    Not a thing that&#039;s redeeming about this piece of garbage. I don&#039;t throw the word &quot;cringe&quot; often, but I couldn&#039;t even watch some parts without skipping through. It takes itself too seriously, all the &quot;horror&quot; and &quot;drama&quot; are rendered useless because of the stupidity of the rest of the anime. <br />
The animation is cheap, they were obviously cutting corners where they could.<br />
Music and sound is just &quot;generic anime sound/music&quot;. Voice acting was pretty poor too, often not syncronised with the characters.<br />
The characters were downright boring. Emotionless mc and an obnoxious sidekick. Very original. The creators of the original indie game obviously were into creepypasta. Nice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289027">
        &quot;original character&quot;. None of the villains stood out either, painfully generic to the T (mad scientist, sadistic pretty lady... really?). Maybe they were supposed to be generic on purpose, but I can&#039;t make myself watch more of this without heavy drinking.<br />
Overall, just don&#039;t bother. Just go watch a playthrough of the original indie game. At least then you can get some dubious enjoyment from knowing that the let&#039;s player is suffering alongside with you.

    Jesus Christ, how do these guys make money? <br />
<br />
I, much like you read the bio, and expected a GENIUS plotline. <br />
Once again, Japanese films fail at what American filmworks and animation studios NAIL everytime. Character development and pacing. I....I watched three episodes of a none mystery anime and have ZERO idea of what it&#039;s even about. <br />
<br />
Pro tip? Don&#039;t just SCREAM OUT A CHARACTERS ENTIRE ARC, BACKSTORY, AND PERSONALITY IN ONE EPISODE; IN ONE SCENE. Film is nothing more than an interesting way to convey information. Thats IT!!!! The rest is just extra stuff on the salad. If you need fried chicken strips to enjoy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287066">
        your salad...well then eat a fricken chicken sandwich. Thats all this anime IS!!!! Bacon, and chicken strips sprinkled on it. Why is the character whose roll is to be interesting having his entire backstory presented in front of us.<br />
<br />
Fight Scenes: Guns are so modernized and advanced vs. melee that you usually need a GINORMOUS reason not to include them in ANY mostly combat anime. They said &quot;Nah, scythes are cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Good ideas? Don&#039;t ruin the entirety of your work by contradicting the main plot and character. Not really a SPOILER, but really the entire premise of the anime which is introduced from the beginning. Calm down. She wants to die? Fine, for whatever reason she isn&#039;t willing to do it herself they&#039;re MULTIPLE occasions where she has a chance.<br />
<br />
What killed it for me? The pacing and character development. The plot made no sense. Why is the character threatening the other character with death? She can die anytime she likes. <br />
<br />
SCREEN PLAY 101: Introduce EVERYTHING so you dont have any ass pulls. Ever since the genius that is ready player one? They find an interesting way to INTRODUCE EVERYTHING so you don&#039;t have any ass pulls. I.E. foreshadowing. Its awesome. It also pro typically builds the intensity tards.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, what really killed this anime was itself. I think it had MAJOR potential but the characters there just seem unnecessary. When you write a screenplay you want as much lettuce as possible. Then, the obvious salad dressing. Bacon, tomatoes, chicken and the other things aren&#039;t necessary. They&#039;re tools to drive the FLAVOR home.<br />
<br />
Spicy salad? Chicken would do well.<br />
<br />
Regular salad? No need for extras, fresh lettuce, a good dressing and maybe a vegetable like an onion to spice it up will do fine.

    Blandness all around. Angels of Death started off strong, and then just went downhill from there. The show gets edgier by the episode, to the point of being unbearable. The plot moves at an incredibly slow pace. Nothing seems to ever happen. Elevator scenes take minutes, and the main characters spend a good chunk of the episode time just repeating the same things over and over. The show attempts to create a compelling mystery, but fails miserably and ends up giving birth to a bloody mess. And just so you know, a certain character in this show has limitless amounts of blood stored in them.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289003">
        Highly disappointing. <br />
The only good part of the show is the ED.

    So this is my first review so sorry if its kinda bad. Also sorry for my crappy english<br />
<br />
But this anime was a very big disappointment for me. I expected so much more but it ended up being an edgy &quot;humorous&quot; mess I can only imagine 13 year olds can enjoy. <br />
<br />
So lets start of with our main character rachel gardner who just loves to remind the audience that she really wants to die BUT it can only be done by isaac becouse &quot;he swore it to god&quot; or some crap like that. This gets annoying very fast and I just couldnt help but think &quot;yeah

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287078">
        I get it now, you want to die&quot; every time she said how much she wanted to die, also the reason why it must be done by isaac is complete bull crap and is only there for convenience so the anime can exist for more than 3 episodes. Maybe there is a deeper reason for all this but I just cant bring my self to watch any more of this disaster of an anime. Also, what is up with the tone of this anime. It tries to be a horror anime but at the same time it tries to throw in &quot;funny&quot; jokes in moments that would other wise be quite intense. The animation is decent I guess it doesnt really have anything special or note worthy, except for the thousands of cgi doors that look really out of place and weird.<br />
<br />
The good things I can say about this anime is that its op and ending are pretty nice and the first episode also was pretty great.<br />
<br />
I know I probably should finish the anime and see if it gets better but I just cant bring my self to watch this mess of an anime any longer, and trust me I wanted to love this anime, I mean just look at isaacs design and the premise looked pretty neat. But it just fails so hard and I just cant help but feel disappointed about this anime. I qould give this anime an 4/10 becouse it does have some nice things in it but the bad just really outshines the good in this anime

    What should you be expecting from Satsuriku no Tenshi? A promise between a pure murderer and a mysterious girl and their journey together, mixed with some self-discovery. <br />
<br />
I first took notice of this series in the Summer 2018 lineup. The synopsis intrigued me so much, I read the manga and watched a complete playthrough of the game. The anime adaption, so far, is faithful to the source. It draws primarily from the manga but the released episodes have taught me they’re ready to adapt little things to fit a big screen. <br />
<br />
Episode 1 was fast-paced and edgy while later episodes settle into a more relaxed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284898">
        atmosphere. Our main characters reveal their true colours-- Zack is a goofy madman, while Rachel does a 180 and becomes a monotonous doll. The reason for her mood change was confusing (basically Rachel remembered something) so I felt the anime should have made it clearer. To be fair, it was never fully explained in the game nor in the manga, and it is difficult to explain without spoiling. One thing I noticed is that they skipped backstories for some characters (shame) but if it was a necessary sacrifice to adapt everything.<br />
<br />
I love the light sprinkling of humour. Some may find it off putting but it adds to the interesting relationship between Rachel and Zack. Some also find the constant repeating of ‘kill me’ and ‘swear to god’ annoying but trust me, it eases off over time and the characters (namely Zack) does comment on it. <br />
<br />
JC Staff did a good job on the anime because I really dig the aesthetics of the show. I also like the use of effects; it gives a polished, modern look. (wish they toned down the yellow filter/glow thing…) Character designs stay consistent and faithful to the original ones and did I mention how much I love their eyes? Eyes (‘peepers’ lol) were prominent in the original game: the heterochromia of both Zack and Danny, the light in Rachel’s eyes and the piercing blue of her eyes.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with the OP and ED. Opening ‘Vital’ is sung by Endoh Masaaki and written by Jin. Ending ‘Pray’ is sung by Chisuga Haruka (VA of Rachel) and written by DECO*27. Both are sung by accomplished singers and written by popular vocaloid producers (HYPE). I don’t know how to judge music but to my ears, both themes fit the anime well! The visuals are also impressive. I love the nod to the original chara designs at the beginning and the signboard holding at the end of the OP; whereas in the ED I love the footprints and the English words that correspond to the lyrics.<br />
<br />
Personally, I did not find the game particularly gripping or life-changing. It’s really not as amazing as people make it out to be &gt;&lt; Nonetheless, it is a breath of fresh air from recent anime. If the anime keeps the original spirit of the source, adapts parts of the game to better suit a anime and makes full use of its medium, it could well be considered anime of the season(barring certain popular sequels…)<br />
<br />
Please note that horror and puzzle-solving will not play a big part! I’ve seen many people classify it as a horror anime but the horror in here is tame. Be prepared to be disappointed if you were expecting a groundbreaking psychological thriller. To me, the main selling point of this series was that it was short and satisfying, with the right amount of edginess and completeness. There are way too many light novel/manga adaptations nowadays that adapt one tiny bit source leaving many loose ends but Angels of Death is sourced from a game, which means you can experience the whole story in one perfect 16-ep package. <br />
<br />
Should you watch Satsuriku no Tenshi? Yes, but I recommend playing the game/watching a walkthrough of the game first. (If you want to experience both game and manga, do game first. The quality of art between the two is astounding. Not that game art is bad. It&#039;s endearing. But I digress.) Satsuriku no Tenshi is a series that benefits from rewatching as it creates a better experience and clears up many confusions. So give Satsuriku no Tenshi a chance because ultimately it is worth watching♡<br />
