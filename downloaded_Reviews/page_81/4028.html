    I&#039;ve always been a huge fan of Gothic Horror. Dark, creepy, and bloody shows have been things that have always interested me. I also love a good vampire story. Now add to that the fact that I enjoy a good mystery or crime drama, and the reason I decided to review this next show should be a no brainer. As the back cover proudly exclaims this &quot;combines urban crime drama and horror motifs&quot;. Ah, it&#039;s like a show made specifically for my tastes. But I also think this is the type of show that could have a much wider appeal. I ran into this title

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21458">
        at my local Blockbuster probally about a year ago now. It was so out of place among the more popular titles avaible for rent there, that I just had to check it out. They only had the second volume, which covers the second half of the 12 episode series, but I didn&#039;t mind. This series was easy to get into midway through. I was instantly hooked because episode 7, the first one I saw, is such a strong episode. Since then I&#039;ve of course bought both volumes, and watched the show a few times through.<br />
<br />
The anime series is based off of a PC game by the same name, created by TomBoy. The anime series was produced by AIC, and ran on TV from July to September in 1998. Shido is a vampire, and a private detective living in Japan. He&#039;s devoted himself to saving humans, not killing them or turning them to vampires, as the other vampires do. He rocks cool pink hair, and an interesting style of clothing, and hunts &quot;nightbreeds&quot;. Nightbreeds are the name for lesser demons in the series, who need to feed on, or control human beings in order to survive. One of Shido&#039;s &quot;powers&quot; as a vampire, is he is able to turn his blood into a weapon that can kill or harm nightbreeds. Yayoi is a member of a secret organization designed to investigate cases involving nightbreeds, hunt them down, and destroy them and she often works with Shido to do this. Since he is a vampire, he is very powerful, and can use his many skills to accomplish their goals, and solve the many cases. And Riho Yamazaki is the high school girl who just so happens to work part time as a secretary at Shido&#039;s detective agency. At first Riho is blissfully unaware of the dark secrets that are hiding just beneath the surface at this particular detective agency. You see in their world, humans are unaware that vampires and demons exist for the most part. And the reason she ended up working for Shido has to do with him investigating her parents mysterious deaths. Riho starts to develop a bit of crush on Shido, and wishes to help him with his many cases. And although Shido does not want her to get involved in the nightbreed cases, she eventually does many times, and predictably enough she does learns the dark secrets of Shido in due time. And circumstances develop in which a powerful enemy fatally wounds Riho and she must be turned into a vampire, or left to die (I won&#039;t spoil how this happens). Of course she chooses the former. The rest of the series follows those three attempting to solve the many crimes involving nightbreeds within the city. Now there&#039;s a crap load of demons here for them to find, so we&#039;re ganna have to just assume their city has a gateway to hell in it or something, but whatever. I&#039;ll buy it. During each case these three (and of course their gremlin little mascot, Guni) must figure out who exactly is the nightbreed (nightbreeds can take control of human beings), or where the nightbreed is, or even if a nightbreed truly is the cause of the problems in the first place (nightbreeds are also sometimes just called &quot;breeds&quot; for short by the way). And this is where the mystery element comes in, as we don&#039;t know who or what is the nightbreed, and are guessing along with our friends here. Sure some episodes are not set up like this, and are instead pretty straight forward, in that there is a nightbreed, they know where it is, and must fight or chase after it. And these episodes are very good as well. There is also an overall story that develops involving Cain, the vampire who turned Shido into a vampire in the first place, and is the only one who knows Shido&#039;s true past. And Cain becomes the main &quot;bad guy&quot; of the series so to speak. He doesn&#039;t care about human beings, and kills many people to satisfy his thirst. Shido and Riho on the other hand drink blood donated by Yayoi, so no one has to die for their survival. And also the series deals with Riho struggling to come to terms with the recent loss of her humanity, her new thirst for blood and dislike for the sun, and the fact that she will outlive all of her friends, classmates at school, and everyone else she knows.<br />
<br />
Ok I&#039;ll admit there&#039;s a lot going on in this series. It even manages to touch on Shido and Riho&#039;s relationship (being more then friends, and maybe lovers?) a bit. It&#039;s difficult to explain all the different aspects of the show very well. But the series handles each part with expertise, and it&#039;s not nearly as complex as it sounds. Each and every episode is different enough as to not get repetitive, and main plot does move along at a great pace. The idea of Shido having to deal with his past with Cain (as his homosexual lover I may add), and also trying to cope with not knowing who he was before he was bitten is quite interesting. And this takes a toll on him, and you can notice this. It&#039;s also another stroke of genius to have the only person who has any idea who he was before he became a vampire be Cain himself. The transition of Riho from human to vampire, and her dealing with this is handled very well. It&#039;s not angsty or anything, because her one wish is to live forever with Shido, and it seems she can now do that, but it&#039;s not exactly &quot;yeah I&#039;m a vampire!! I&#039;m so happy!!&quot; either, and this middle of the road feeling makes a lot of sense. On the one hand she didn&#039;t really want to die, and she does want to live with Shido for all time. At yet she doesn&#039;t really want to be a vampire, and she misses being able to do many human things. This struggle with her loss of humanity and being a vampire is handled very well and is never forgetten about. She is of course aided by Shido, who tries to help her and guide her when he can. This of course parallels Shido&#039;s former relationship with Cain, only he felt humans were nothing but cattle to be used for vampires, while Shido thinks vampires should help humans. Cain made Shido a vampire, and was his mentor, and now Shido has made Riho a vampire, and became her mentor. This is a very interesting way for AIC to handle the series, and I really liked this aspect of the show. And character development for all the major characters, even the little mascot goblin guy, is really well done. They flesh out each and every one of the major characters, and somehow find the time to reveal each of their back stories, and show who Cain really is, all while hunting down nightbreeds or solving cases involving nightbreeds. Kinda amazing they fit all that in there. And many of the mysteries have great twists you won&#039;t see coming. <br />
<br />
(***small spoiler*** ) Hell they manage to reveal the entire back story of one character, and part of another WITHOUT you even noticing this until the very end the episode!! That was a great twist! (***end spoilers***) <br />
<br />
Even some of the minor characters who manage to stick around a little get some development, which I really liked. However the series probably did try and do a little too much. As some of the &quot;nightbreeds of the week&quot; have very little screen time, so they do seem a little generic. Few of them are really fleshed out. But this is a small problem. A bigger problem is that by the end of the series, the main plot is not really tied up. The series doesn&#039;t end with a cliffhanger or anything, but it feels like there&#039;s more to tell. It&#039;s not bad, but not very satisfying if you want real the main plot to actually come to an end. However I am not bothered much by this, mostly because the last episode is incredibly dramatic, suspenseful, and just very powerful. I know a few people will be bothered by what they do here, but I really loved the way the last episode was handled. Sure they never get to finishing up the main plot, but I&#039;ll be alright with that if that means we get an amazing episode like this. And it is a good episode to end the show on. Oh and I probably should mention the first four episode are very odd. Anime News Network notes that the series started as a 4 episode OVA, and then continued as a TV series were the OVA left off. I&#039;m also willing to bet there was a big change in staff between these episodes as well. As the overall tone, style, and content of the show changes significantly (and for the better I may add). While, sadly, the TV series toned down the blood, gore, and violence, the writing really moved up a few notches. The first 4 episodes were very uneven in terms of writing. One would be all right, the next would be kinda bad, and then another episode pretty good. And then we also have the completely uncalled for nudity in one of the episodes. Look I&#039;m not against nudity or anything, but in a series like this, and the way it&#039;s done, well it kind felt unneeded and stupid. Also I really liked the change in character design between the first 4 episodes and the rest. Perhaps it&#039;s because I started the series at episode 7, so that is what I was used to, but I really like the different character designs much more.<br />
<br />
As far as production values go, this is about average for 1998. The animation is pretty good. The artwork is detailed, although very reminiscent of early 90&#039;s or even 80&#039;s anime. I&#039;m pretty sure this was intentional, as it really goes with the music style which I&#039;ll get to in a bit. I really like the style though, and the second character designs are really nice looking. The original character designs manage to make Riho really ugly looking, and I don&#039;t like Yayoi&#039;s hair at all. But when it was an OVA it seemed to have the budget to really pay attention to what all the minor characters looked like, and so all of the earlier minor characters look a bit better. So it evens its self out I guess, although I&#039;d rather my main characters look good and not worry much about the minor cast. As for the music, it&#039;s exceptional. They went with a great jazz inspired background theme, and it really works. If you closed your eyes you&#039;d think you were watching some old crime drama from the 1970&#039;s or 1980&#039;s, and it&#039;s very fitting. The opening theme is distinctive, and the ending theme is very good too. But I really love the background themes! Some themes don&#039;t sound like that however, and instead sound like they are straight out of a 80&#039;s horror flick. So with the 80&#039;s inspired music, I think it&#039;s fitting why the art style looks a little 80&#039;s inspired. And it&#039;s not bad artwork either.<br />
<br />
The dub for this was produced at Bang Zoom, in late 1999 and early 2000. And it is a pretty good dub. While not amazing, and it does show it&#039;s age a bit, I really found myself enjoying it. The star of the dub is easily Richard Cansino, who plays Shido quite well. He gives that character a distinct feeling, and really understands where he is going with the dub. I should probably also mention that at times Shido narrates the story, filling us in on a few things here and there. And Cansino&#039;s narration gives the anime a film noir feeling that&#039;s definitely called for and adds to the overall atmosphere. Yayoi is played by Jane Alan. At times Alan does not seem like she&#039;s giving it her all; it&#039;s a little disappointing. She just didn&#039;t seem enthusiastic enough at certain times, and at others like she wasn&#039;t sure what she should be doing or how she should be saying it. Luckily for most of the anime she&#039;s not like this, and does a wonderful job. She fit her character very well. I probably shouldn&#039;t be so harsh on her. Riho is played by Dorothy Elias-Fahn who does a really good job. She gives her character just enough spunk, youthfulness, and playfulness to fit Riho. And she knows when to tone down the happy-go-lucky side of herself when needed. Also I MUST apploud her for her work in the final episode (don&#039;t worry no spoilers). As I already alluded to it&#039;s quite a dramatic episode, and I thought she handled it perfectly. She did a truly great job. Now why couldn&#039;t she be this good in Vampire Princess Miyu?? Cain is played by Lex Lang, and he&#039;s not bad. But I really thought he could have been better. Sandy Fox plays Guni, and I&#039;m assuming they pitched her voice up a bit here. I thought the way they made her sound fit Guni well, and that she was quite good as well. I liked how the main cast here was filled with lesser known actors, and on the whole I liked how different this dub sounded then many other LA dubs of the time. Many of the episidic characters are voiced by better known actors however, like Michelle Ruff, Mona Marshall, and Wendee Lee. And they of course do a good. job. But again many of the other minor characters are played by lesser-known actors, and they too go a good job. So in short, this is a dub worth checking out. Although it&#039;s not really too impressive or anything. It is however a rare LA dub from CPM, since they usually stuck to New York City, so I do find that interesting.<br />
<br />
This anime is very well done. It has a great fleshed out main cast, an interesting story, and decent dub. The production values are good, and it&#039;s an interesting mix of genres. If you plan on buying this on DVD, watch out for the dub-only release Central Park Media released (if you don&#039;t want that version that is). I own the 2 volume release from 2004, and it has both an English and Japanese track, along with one extra. The extra feature is a comparison of the storyboard to the finished product and it&#039;s on both DVDs. This was a nice little extra, that they really didn&#039;t need to add on. However I do wish there was something more, like a behind the scenes look at the dub, or a commentary or something. But hey I&#039;ll take whatever extra they throw at me. The small problems with the show, make me subtract a half a star from my rating, but I still highly recommend this title. It&#039;s an under watched gem that could really catch on in my opinion.

    Alright, first off, this show is not one for those that want an answer right away. It doesn’t even have a rather good ending in my mind because it leaves as a cliff hanger. Some things in the story feel left out and just thrown in at the last minute as though they tried to stay to the game storyline but also change it for a monster by week style show. <br />
<br />
Tatsuhiko Shido is the perfect vampire in my mind. He is hunted by his past and looks to set things right though he can’t stop who he is. He drinks blood and can’t go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70635">
        into the sunlight most of the time it seems (Sometimes it seems they forget that as we see him in the sun once in a while). Almost everything about a traditional vampire is in this and they add a few extra things. I love the idea that he can create a sword with his blood though he doesn’t do it all that much. <br />
<br />
Yayoi is a rather sexual little thing, and she and Shido have an interesting relationship. She gives him blood in exchange for help on nightbreed cases. Again, we don’t get much from her. <br />
<br />
His little fairy girl, Guni, is just a bit to much like Navi in how annoying she is. Most of the time, I just wish she was silent because she just doesn’t do anything for the story. She sits in his hair and barely comes out except to say something annoying.<br />
<br />
Riho is an interesting little girl. We really don’t get much of a story line except that she lost her parents in a nightbreed fight. She is turned into a vampire by Shido in one episode and then almost whenever we see her after, she is just trying to cope with the change. We rarely see her but when we do, we get a sad sort of loneliness about her. She loves Shido a lot and has a pretty big jealous streak when it comes to Yayoi.<br />
<br />
There isn’t much known about Cain except he seems to have a very sexual obsession with Shido. I guess it might be my yaoi fan girl thing, but it they do not hold back on the sexual lust this guy has for him. I really want to know why he changed Shido into a Vampire but they never really explain much about it.<br />
<br />
As you can see, we don’t get much about the characters and so sometimes it is hard to feel for them when they are hurt but I feel even more for Shido. He’s more the only character I connect to. Even the story doesn’t help much. We don’t get a lot about this ‘Golden Dawn’ or about the backgrounds of characters. It seems deep but then it is actually a bit shallow.<br />
<br />
The animation is pretty good, though the first 4 episodes are much better and not TV friendly because it was made to be an OVA. At some point, they decided to have a whole TV show of it and the quality dropped. I can somewhat understand since the first 4 don’t really don’t work as just a story, I just wish the animation didn’t suffer for it. <br />
<br />
The English voices are pretty good. Shido has this gentle gruff of his voice that’s perfect for a detective and yet also has an air about someone mysterious. It’s pretty much the same with Cain who is voiced with Lex Lang though he does not hand many lines. I really love the music in the opening. It is rather a hunting tune. The ending song is alright, though not the best. It just feels like a sappy love song when there isn’t really all that much love in the show. The background music works well and has a rather detective feel to it both in English and Japanese.

    Welcome, to the second review of horror anime month. Night Walker: Mayonaka no Tantei is a twelve episode anime from the late 90s, based on an eroge from the early 90s. It was brought to us by our old friends at AIC, which could be a good or a bad thing. They did bring us such treats as Sasameki Koto &amp; Bubblegum Crisis. But they also sharted OreImo &amp; Isekai no Seikishi no Monogatari at us.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Night Walker follows a vampire detective named Shidou. His personal mission is to protect humans from supernatural monsters called “breeds.” Shidou works with Yayoi, a woman who&#039;s part of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201236">
        special anti-breed unit, Guni, a green faerie of some variety and Riho, a high-school girl who tags along because why wouldn&#039;t they be okay with that? It&#039;s not like they&#039;re going into danger and she has no training. Okay, I&#039;ll be fair, she starts out mostly hanging out in the office and there&#039;s a reason they start letting her go along with them. The series follows them as they investigate various incidents involving supernatural beings and follows Shidou as he tries to unravel the mystery of his past. He came down with plot convenience amnesia at some point and can&#039;t remember his life before he was turned.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s discuss the flaws of the series. The biggest problem is that the big climax comes far too early. It&#039;s really a waste since everything that comes after is less intense and important. However, it is understandable in this case. Why? Because the series was originally intended to be a four episode OVA and the other two-thirds was added later to make it a series. Still, they should have found something bigger and more dramatic to work towards in those eight episodes. There&#039;s also a problem with consistency. Basically, the fourth episode ends on a very specific note and the very next episode immediately contradicts it in two major ways with no explanation for what happened. It could have worked if there was more time between the events of the two episodes but all indications suggest that there&#039;s not much of a skip. Did this project have an editor? It also bothers me that Shidou gets all of his blood from Yayoi. While it is a nice touch that he takes blood from a willing donor, it really doesn&#039;t make sense for all of it to come from one person. The human body needs time to produce blood. Does he just not drink often or does a vampire feeding off of you make your blood production quadruple in this series? There&#039;s also a major cop-out at the end. I won&#039;t spoil it, but it&#039;s really bad.<br />
<br />
On a positive note, the idea of the series is pretty compelling. I like that people know what the breed are and there&#039;s a task force set up instead of the stereotype of having the supernatural elements being completely unknown by the populace and, somehow, covered up. A lot of the individual episodes are pretty interesting too, in spite of them being largely pretty simplistic. The series also does a good job of giving the audience snippets and hints about Shidou&#039;s past in a way that does add to the narrative.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Overall, the characters are pretty generic. They aren&#039;t bad, but there&#039;s also not much to them. Riho is definitely the weakest since she&#039;s the most effected by the inconsistency problem and since her character is pretty much defined by being a tag along. Shidou is the strongest since he has the most going on in his back-story.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art in this is pretty dated by today&#039;s standards. However, in the context of its time, it&#039;s pretty standard. There are some interesting looking monsters and the action sequences can be nicely done. The biggest issue is that the character designs shift after the first four episodes and I&#039;m not blaming this one on those having been originally intended for an OVA. It&#039;s not like the staff couldn&#039;t have looked back on what they&#039;d done and followed it. It&#039;s not like the second designs are any better.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
They got some pretty good actors. Yamazaki Takumi does really well in the leading role. We also get Shinohara Emi, hi Sailor Jupiter, Tanaka Hideyuki, Sakamoto Maaya and Ootani Ikue who doesn&#039;t over-act in this, unlike the role we heard her in last week. Overall, the acting isn&#039;t the best I&#039;ve heard from any of the people involved but it&#039;s pretty decent. The music isn&#039;t bad. It&#039;s not anything special but it&#039;s passable.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a bit. It&#039;s clear that Shidou and Cain used to be involved, that their relationship was less than healthy and that Cain still has the hots for Shidou. Dude really needs to let his ex-boyfriends go.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Night Walker: Mayonaka no Tantei isn&#039;t a bad series. It has some problems and some good things going for it. It&#039;s fairly simple and, in many ways, standard, but it isn&#039;t bad. If you&#039;re interested in seeing a vampire detective hunt monsters and don&#039;t really care about complexity, you&#039;ll probably like it. As for me, I&#039;m calling it mediocre. Final rating is a 5/10. Next week I&#039;m looking at Mars of Destruction because someone suggested it as a horror thing I could look at.

    This short series was actually adapted from the Mayonaka no Tantei Night Walker PC game developed by company Tomboy and Arieroof…..yeah, I have never heard of those company’s either lol <br />
<br />
Animation<br />
<br />
Animated by Studio AIC in 1998, I have to say it&#039;s not bad for the time it was made and even now in 2012 its passable….nothing special.<br />
<br />
The Demons and few battle scenes are pretty average and the same goes for the opening and closing sequences. Character designs have a bit of that clamp-ish girly style…….which should be  expected somewhat for this sort of vampire series.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Speaking about the english dubbed version the strongest point for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72119">
        this title is the sound. The voice actors do a solid job, in particular we get to hear Richard Cansino (best known for playing Kenshin) lend his talents fo the main character Shido which actually fits very well.<br />
<br />
The opening theme was alright, it has an odd sounding yet appropriate gloomy melody and the closing theme has a surprisingly cool and slightly upbeat rocky love theme.<br />
<br />
Characters   <br />
<br />
The Characters in this show are somewhat predictable and stale with the odd episode that attempts to flesh them out a little bit more…to no real avail.<br />
<br />
 Our three main characters at the detective agency stick to their archetypes and its really only from the main protagonist that we get a decent understanding of…everybody else is undeveloped….even for this short series it could have been done a little better.<br />
<br />
Again, characters not hateable but pretty much paint by numbers <br />
<br />
<br />
Storyline<br />
<br />
Hey, It’s a vampire with a good heart that runs a detective agency with his human friends…hmmm….where have I seen this idea before (cough ANGEL cough)….meh...jk..I know this was out wayy before ANGEL i&#039;m jus teasing<br />
<br />
Okay, well the majority of this story is an episodic monster of the week run of ordinary people either being taken advantage of by demons or bad people making deals with demons leading to a (mostly) unhappy ending…hmm that rings another bell (cough..Vampire Princess Miyu…cough).<br />
<br />
Although the premise itself feels unoriginal it’s not a particularly boring show. The situations are somewhat interesting and there are actually a few episodes that I really did enjoy (e.g stuck in a well) but the problem is this series doesn’t establish a solid major plot so it feels like your just watching a random mystery of the episode series with no real foundation for anything.<br />
<br />
The series also ends with more questions than answers and you just feel like you just saw chapter one of an unfinished vampire novel.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
It was moderately enjoyable and helped pass some time while I was ironing my clothes…and there were a few curveball episodes otherwise it was just kinda meh<br />
<br />
Value<br />
<br />
Not very high on value to be honest. If it was already on TV and you had nothing better to do it’s alright to watch I guess but really it’s just a vintage filler anime show with no standout traits <br />
<br />
Planet Tyro Rating: Watchable<br />

    The graphics is pretty old, so you should get used to the art. The story tends to drag a bit, and the main girl character is really unnecessary....I will say that the best parts of this anime is when you get glimpses of his past. Since his memories are the only interesting stories, and all the evil creatures are pretty much the same and one episode is the same as the others. Overall there really is no real notable development in the story.<br />
<br />
On a personal note, this anime would have been much more interesting if it was yaoi (that&#039;s what cain is for!!!)...which is what

    I love episodic series.<br />
<br />
They allow people who are just channel browsing to be able to enjoy a show without needing to know too much about the earlier episodes, but can easily go back and watch once they have seen the episode.<br />
<br />
<br />
NightWalker: Midnight Detective is the best episodic shows I have seen (both anime and outside of anime).<br />
<br />
<br />
I won’t go into too much detail about the story because the story changes in each episode, but the premise of each episode is about a private detective (who is a vampire who cannot remember his past) solving mysteries caused by parasitic demons known as Night-Breeds.<br />
<br />
The stories in each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312773">
        episode is intriguing, action packed and full of themes and elements that only anime can truly bring to life.<br />
<br />
<br />
The series was originally going to be released to be a 4 episode OVA, but then got picked up to be a series. But unfortunately, it got cancelled after only one season consisting of 12 episodes. But judging by that in the 90s, episodic anime weren’t popular in Japan at all (as shown by series such as Cowboy Bebop also being episodic and also failing to catch a wide audience in Japan.) but unlike Cowboy Bebop, the West has also forgotten this series*, which is a shame because it is one of the best anime of all time (and I DON’T say that lightly!)<br />
<br />
This series (due to its episodic nature and not having the crazy hijinks that anime tends to have (I.e. over exaggerated facial expressions and fan service that turn most people away from the medium) is one of the most accessible anime for those who are unfamiliar with the medium. Especially those who are fans of the fantasy and thriller genres.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the kind of show that is best watched like you would watch a show on TV. Watch two episodes back-to-back and then watch another couple of episodes either the next day or the next week (though I did end up watching the entire series in just three days!)<br />
<br />
This series is an underrated masterpiece that anyone can enjoy. Both those who are new to the genre or are anime veterans will love this series.<br />
<br />
Let’s hope that HOPEFULLY one day, we will get more episodes.<br />
But until that day, we can rest and be assured that this gem will be there to greet both new and old fans alike when they enter the world of anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
*this is probably because the vhs and DVD releases in the west are just terrible (apart from the second volume dvd that was released in the USA, that actually looks decent, but makes the series look more like a vampire romance series like Twilight). They either make the series look like an erotic, ultra violent anime (the volume 1 USA release), a hardcore Yuri/Yaoi title (such as the two-disc USA dvd release) or that it’s a Yu-Gi-Oh rip-off (such as the 3-disc UK release by MVM Films, which is the WORST DVD cover I have seen for the series! The art on the actual discs look good and make the series WAY more interesting).

    I am so far liking the plot but find that the first four episodes have a tendency to jump to a different day without warning. I find the episodes a little rushed. Otherwise I really do like it. After I got used to the sound and graphics, anyway. I was originally hesitant to watch it because of it&#039;s age but I&#039;m glad I did. The sound effects are incredibly cheesy but it&#039;s good all the same. I would definitely recommend any vampire fan watch this

    The show is nice and all, but certainly not for children under 18; there is Action and Adventure... the Show always starts with a murder or something, the shows mostly keeps you guessing, the characters are entertaining... especially Shido, A vampire who doesn&#039;t know his past... but comes to terms with it because he accepted it and said that he didn&#039;t want his memories because he likes his own life right now... the story with Yayoi is not really expected though it does make sense why she joined the NOS, the story is nice as well, there are several Red Herrings (False Clues) leading you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15111">
        to the wrong suspect... but later the &quot;Host&quot; of the &quot;Night Breed&quot; always reveals itself and it&#039;s up to Shido to kill it and save the &quot;Day&quot;... the Characters are well drawn, and the sounds make it look and feel like a 70s film, as for me I really enjoyed the story and for those who like vampires and mysteries at the same time... this is the anime for you... overall... this rating is 8...
