<br />
Jashin-chan Dropkick is about a naked snek-girl who’s trying to kill and adorable goth loli. She fails and gets horrifically brutalized by chainsaws and knives and iron maidens and moe snow creatures and other similarly terrifying weapons. If that doesn’t sound fun to you then turn 360 degrees and moonwalk away, because that’s about half the show.<br />
<br />
I’m the type that enjoys ridiculous, over-the-top violence. While No Dropkick on Snek doesn’t contain any real detail with its violence, the implication is good enough to sell it. Particularly because the one inflicting such violence is doing it with an evil grin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289254">
        on her cute face, because Snake-chan is a fucked up individual who actually deserves it, and because the animation is actually quite good for this type of anime. But I feel like enjoying this or not depends on the individual viewer. You either get it or you don’t. I looked at this anime before it started and thought “this sounds fucking hilarious”, watched the first episode, and thought it was fucking hilarious. No deep reasoning behind it, really, I just like the use of violence as a joke.<br />
<br />
So now, all I really have to do is clarify a couple of things. First off, there’s no story in this anime; you probably could’ve guessed that, but there’s not even context as to why anything is happening in this anime. The first episode offers no introductions, but I thought this was clever. In a dumb gag series, I’m not expecting particularly detailed characters in the first place, especially in a series like this that uses religious references as jokes. Jashin-chan is a devil, so she acts like a cunt all the time. That is her character. Everyone else could be summed up in equally short statements; a quick glance at how each character acts is enough to determine all that they are. The lone exception is Urine (oh dear, what an unfortunate name indeed), who’s the only human of the series, as far as major characters go. But her enigmatic character acts as a landing pad for many of the series’ jokes, in terms of violence and fourth wall breaks. Urine’s character doesn’t have any particular set of rules, which means that her actions and dialogue have fewer limits, which is why it’s funny for her to get a chainsaw out of thin air.<br />
<br />
Moreover, backstories have a tendency to drag out too long and waste time from the real draw of the anime. The point is that Jashin and Urine have to kill each other; the fact that there’s a cowgirl and a stoner chick make little difference to that. Those characters are already distractions. How they got here doesn’t matter, what matters is that they’re here. Like I said, “Quick and to the Pointless”. This anime doesn’t have much of a point to begin with; it’s all shenanigans. A meme anime, if you will. It exists so that you can put it on whenever you feel like distracting yourself from whatever bullshit you’ve got going on in your life, or perhaps after a really dramatic, intense episode of another seasonal on your list, like Asobi Asobase.<br />
<br />
Which would bring me into the other thing to defend: repetition. I can’t say that this anime is repetitive, but I also can’t say that it’s not repetitive. Probably because that doesn’t affect me too much when I’m watching anime weekly, and you should also take this in small doses. If you try downing too much of it at once, you’re just gonna hate the taste of it pretty quickly. <br />
<br />
Jashin plotting and executing the murder of Urine, only to get dunked on in two seconds is a large part of the anime. Another large part is Jashin being an asshole to someone else, causing Urine to violently execute her. Fortunately, it manages to safely pad itself out with some other characters. They’re one-note, but good enough to pass the time. I would complain that there were a few too many scenes of Pekola, as the joke of her character runs thin pretty quickly. Meanwhile, there’s very, very little exploration with Minos, who I thought was a lot more fun with her quirky, but not super exaggerated personality. She feels like the most normal character of the anime, despite qualifying as a devil. But she’s also so normal that she doesn’t really leave an impression. But, even if all the character are one-note, they have a witty enough chemistry to keep the laughing gas flowing. I wasn’t bored at any point.<br />
<br />
To better present itself, Jashin-chan Dropkick has a surprisingly high level of animation. Not only does character movement look good in and of itself, but the character designs are memorable and the anime has a rather colorful, fun look to it. They likely managed to maintain this quality by shifting into lesser-detailed styles where characters look a little more simple; but note that I’m not saying this is lower quality. They manage to toy with the fine details without making it look jarring. Everything is as good as it needs to be, most of it is even better.<br />
<br />
But despite all of that, the funniest joke of the whole series is that fucking OST with the shitty recorder. It’s so (intentionally) godawful that I burst out laughing every single time.<br />
<br />
Overall, Jashin-chan Dropkick could stand the test of time as a solid slapstick anime--perhaps its ridiculous, bloody violence makes it more of a niche pick than others, but I had a good time with it. The show delivered what I wanted, and coming back to it every week was never a struggle. I don’t have a whole lot to say as its appeal is simple, but I have even less to complain about.<br />

    Jashin-chan Dropkick happens when Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon meets Yondemasu yo Azazel-san.<br />
<br />
We have colorful bunch of characters here from flying satanist goat-birds to murderous lolita girls. And from Egyptian-Greek mythology combination waifus to lamias (half snake-half human). My views of the series were already rather positive after episode 01, as there were great many characters who all seemed to add something to the series, and it has only been going for better. <br />
<br />
From its core, Jashin-chan is a comedy series which is the combination of cute and grotesque/gory stuff. The setup being similar to other comedy series of the same type such as Detroit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285163">
        Metal City, Mr. Pickles, and the already mentioned Azazel-san. The daily life of our characters centering around demons, murders and various subjects related to Hell. Not, by any means, is this series any more dark nor does it promote satanism more than one bit more well-known comedy series: Hataraku Maou-sama (The Devil is a Part-Timer).<br />
<br />
So far, the comedy has been rather fresh. Some scenes are pure cute girls doing cute things... except it includes murdering someone with a chainsaw. They don&#039;t really die tho, just become fucked and appear rest of the episode partly censored/pixelated, bleeding blood whenever they go. As disgusting as it may sound: it simply isn&#039;t. In this world, it&#039;s as normal as smiling in Maido dragon. In many moeblobs shows, the meme &quot;remember, it&#039;s cute, not retarded.&quot; is relevant. Here is goes &quot;remember, it&#039;s cute, not mentally ill.&quot; <br />
<br />
The art is rather basic. Promotes the cute side of the series more with bright, colorful choices. The character design, as well as the violence including moments, have been planned quite well. For one, it looks silly and innocent rather than being &quot;lol it&#039;s a prank&quot; tier meme when someone gets assaulted, and the design is from the rather original side. Otherwise this work will not be remembered for its production. <br />
<br />
Thus far, Jashin-san is among the better --and certainly among the more original series that are currently airing. I can&#039;t recommend this show to everyone as it will not appeal to every viewer, but I do recommend trying the first episode and deciding based to that. In this case, one episode tells enough.

    Jashin-chan Dropkick, yes Jashin-chan Dropkick. One of the series that has defined the cultural slice of life comedy series of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past summer.<br />
<br />
What I love &#039;bout Jashin-chan Dropkick is the whole “devil aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the assassination arcs really shown the defining elements of how devils worked within the Jashin-chan universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know a lot of people complain about Jashin-chan Dropkick being a half-ass wit that can’t do anything Or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289271">
        perhaps Pekora being useless. But in a way, I look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters.<br />
<br />
Yukiwo did not intend to create the story with a “badass” character right from the start, toppling people one after the other, no. Jashin-chan Dropkick was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and Jahsin-chan is a devil that is trying to fit in with the rest of the humans and be &quot;recognized&quot; I think that was one of the main defining elements of the series. Yukiwo wanted to show that Jashin &quot;is a character that no one likes because she has the body of a serpent&quot;. You can only wonder what she is thinking, being in his predicament.<br />
<br />
Watching her grow up as a devil and trying to kill Yurine, but realizing that she is in a world fraught with fascinating anime girls. Watching her friends get all of the food while Jashin-chan only gets a very small slice that can&#039;t even stand on its own. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards &quot;omg too much drama, get on with the fighting already&quot; But I actually liked how Jashin-chan Dropkick had that drama, it fits in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other slice of life series. I won’t state any names.<br />
<br />
One of the things that Yukiwo really focused on in the original was friendship and bonds. That&#039;s one of the major theme&#039;s watching this group of friends grow up together, learning from her friends and becoming a great devil in the process, learning the ways of the human world. This show explores themes of lust, love, epic fighting, and greed to a very astounding degree.<br />
<br />
<br />
The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented in both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that Yukiwo wanted to show the younger generation the main characters of the show grow and the progression and development into well-rounded characters. They had to learn the ropes of what being a devil is like. These devils are put to the test to show how they must use every ounce of their ability to survive and protect the people they love.<br />
<br />
Perhaps maybe the reason that I love Jashin-chan Dropkick so much and the reason it feels very nostalgic to me is because when I watched it for the first time when it was airing, It was one of THEE most popular anime series on the net and not a single person had anything remotely unscrupulous to say about it. Suddenly after the first episode filler arc, or the not so appreciated “trying to kill Yurine”, it lost its reputation and became a show just muddled by idiots that call anyone a Jashintard for watching it. I have seen how the fanbase has changed significantly over the past summer of watching Jashin-chan Dropkick. It is quite sad really.<br />
<br />
I still consider Jashin-chan Dropkick to be one of my favourite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because I&#039;m very infatuated with devils and like the unique way that Yukiwo has created this human world, similar to how I really love Initial D for its drifting. Every arc is something new and fresh so Yukiwo can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways. Initial D had some of the greatest character backstories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully Jashin-chan Dropkick does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most groundbreaking plot twists.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess it’s all a matter of personal preference and what you like to see in a show. I myself am not a huge fan of typical slice of life tropes that are used consistently, but I love how the original series gave us a so much of a more powerful emotional impact to the show. In a way, it felt more humanized as opposed to the more generic school girl elements of slice of life animes.

    In the season of intense comedies, Jashin-chan Dropkick is the no man&#039;s road followed, the black sheep of the genre with the comedic supernatural &quot;violence and gore&quot; aesthetic. Despite all this, you know it&#039;s legitimately bad when straight at Episode 1, the producers don&#039;t even care to open to us about the characters and their traits, and just straight dives into the comedy action.<br />
<br />
For this reason alone, there are 2 camps: the enjoyment and frustration factors.<br />
If you enjoy this series (like myself), the jokes are few yet decent, the many parodies it tries to imitate with the slapstick comedy. Other than the misplacements of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289253">
        jokes and such that I willing to forgive, this is yet a decent move in the right direction.<br />
If you hate this series (like everyone else who dropped the ball at the very beginning), the violence and gore from Jashin the viper herself will turn heads off, and the comedy will get old really fast. To top it all off, there are barely traces of character development, just their precarious situations towards the harm of another.<br />
<br />
With that said, studio Nomad (rise from your grave!) has done a good representation of the anime adaptation. Sure, it looks simple and bad, but for comedy purposes the drawings are meh but OK, and they fit their purpose. <br />
<br />
In the season of less stellar OPs, I thought that Jashin-chan Dropkick had one of the most creative and funny OP sequences, and props to the VAs for the OP song, which I like a hell lot now, and watching this with song lyrics subtitles just up the ante for me.<br />
<br />
If you feel like you have time on your hands and need a little breather, this series will do, if not go watch others that are much better. And while I enjoy this series from start to end and is underrated, unfortunately it&#039;s not a show you will remember in time to come.<br />
<br />
Jashin-chan is no mere devil, she&#039;ll Dropkick on you heavy!<br />

    Besides the designs which are nice there is not much else going for it. The comedy is very lackluster and there is no story no progression or end goal. It&#039;s always the main character trying to kill her summoner so without really good comedy there is nothing else to back it up. Has some moments where you can get a laugh sometimes when the violence goes to the extreme in that way reminds me a bit to the first season of Dokuro-chan  but that makes up for like 2% of the runtime on each episode and it&#039;s always a very similar build up that

        takes a long time for an kinda expected pay off. It could have worked as like a 2 min or 4 min short episode but the fact that is this long makes it a drag.

    Considering how often I&#039;ve said &quot;Thanks Satan&quot; in an almost serious manner when watching this show, I think that&#039;s actually quite telling of what it means to watch this.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
One day, Hanazono Yurine, a girl who dresses as a chunni goth loli, decided to do a satanic ritual and summon a demon from hell.  From the ritual, she summons the titular Jashin-chan, a backstabbing lamia who due to being pulled out of her home against her will, is hellbent on committing manslaughter in order to break the contract and get back home.  But since this is a slapstick comedy, it does not go quite exactly to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289369">
        plan.<br />
<br />
First thing to note, while Jashin-chan Dropkick the anime is a close adaptation to its parent manga, there are many differences to note that make it different and by extension, less friendly than its comic form.  Anime only characters aside, the adaptation kind of expects you to already know what you&#039;re getting into, throwing more or less the entire cast in your face in the first episode, and the above synopsis out of the window since that&#039;s not that well explained in any point in the series.  <br />
<br />
Logistics aside, what Jashin-chan is is a slapstick comedy that no matter the situation, whether it&#039;s attempted murder, petty crime, or being a public disturbance: Jashin-chan gets her comeuppance either in the form of torture, dismemberment, or a threatening warning depending on the severity of what devilish act she&#039;s doing at the time.  As such, the show can get a bit stale, as Jashin-chan being an asshole is pretty much the entire reason the show exists in the first place, with everyone else either being sucked into, punishing, or just simply sitting on the sidelines to whatever thing she&#039;s doing at the time.<br />
<br />
To spice it up, the show includes several other brands of comedy, most notably 4th wall breaking and referential comedy which add in a nice bit of flair to an otherwise seemingly dull experience, and having side stories involving some of the other characters.  This is easier done since the show usually features A and B parts to split a single episode into smaller stories instead of stretching them out, though the stories that don&#039;t involve Jashin-chan are less enjoyable.  <br />
<br />
Solely relying on the comedic factor of its titular character, Jashin-chan Dropkick is a show that doesn&#039;t really have much to offer beyond an asshole devil and her cohorts.  Its story isn&#039;t really anything to write home about, though it does try to provide character development at the end, which I think was unneeded and kind of disrupted the flow of the show.  On the plus side though, it is amusing for those that enjoy a balls to the wall comedy, so it&#039;s fun for that if anything.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Pretty much knows what it is and sticks with it<br />
+ Amusing<br />
-  Not much else beyond that<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
When talking about this show&#039;s characters, the only real standout one is Jashin-chan herself.  As mentioned before, she&#039;s a psychopathic lamia who desires the death of the  gothic loli who summoned her so she can return home to the fiery pits of hell that she came from.  Among other things, she&#039;s lazy, literally backstabbing, mischievous, and that one guy who makes you pay for their meal.  Which for the purposes of a karma-based slapstick show works wonders for the narrative.  She&#039;s the only one who really pulls their weight in the show cause everyone else only surrounds her regarding any antics or situation that she comes across, even so much so that she becomes a bit of a tsundere due to the show&#039;s need for character growth in its last few episodes.  <br />
<br />
By comparison, her owner and dominant partner, Yurine, doesn&#039;t really do much beyond being there when Jashin-chan commits some immoral act, committing an even more immoral (and technically illegal) act by cutting her tail off, crucifying her, putting her in an iron maiden, stabbing her with various sharp objects, etc etc etc.  As a result of this, Yurine arguably doesn&#039;t have a character, and ironically relies on Jashin-chan to get any form of significant screentime.<br />
<br />
The only other standout character in the cast is Pekola, who stands out for all the wrong reasons.  Being an angel who lost her halo and thus cannot return to heaven, Pekola stands as the show&#039;s B plot involving the world shitting on her while she&#039;s homeless and trying to keep up her christian morals, making almost every appearance of hers trying to make light of an otherwise suffering and depressing situation.  And since her entire character is like this, it becomes one of those needlessly cruel storylines that you can&#039;t sympathize with because there&#039;s nothing to sympathize with<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast kind of follows in Jashin-chan&#039;s footsteps (or...slither trail) as being background characters to her star position.  Minos, an anime only character, only appears to be the headstrong cow she&#039;s supposed to be as a minotaur, and Medusa (despite being my favorite character), spends the majority of the series having her kindness being taken advantage of, being quoted by Jashin-chan as her &#039;ATM&#039;.  The most amusing member of this cast I find is actually Satan himself, who spends the entire series just popping in randomly during story transitions to drop some actually useful knowledge regarding the topic the story was talking about.  It&#039;s one of those anime only features that benefits the show, cause it gave me an excuse to unironically say &quot;Thanks Satan&quot;.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Jashin-chan is a good titular character<br />
+ Thanks Satan<br />
-  Rest of the cast falls flat<br />

Art:<br />
<br />
Produced by Nomad, a studio that&#039;s created Rozen Maiden, Sola, and Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan (they reference this too), the art for Jashin-chan is not special at all.  Actually, I think the quality is actually below average, since there&#039;s not a lot that can be said about the show&#039;s artstyle in general.  The color scheme is muted and not that bright, the character models are average at best, and the majority of the animation budget is devoted to any form of torture that Jashin-chan suffers throughout this weird 11 episode series.  <br />
<br />
That being said, I have to give Nomad credit for the creativity on some of their Jashin-chan torture scenes, as playing with censorship pixelation, referencing other more popular series, and doing whatever they could to make this average series stand out even more is actually quite commendable and gives the series more oomph than it could&#039;ve had.  So good on them.  That being said, I want to ask Yukiwo (the original creator) why Medusa is...dressed in Egyptian-themed clothing.  Y&#039;know, a greek monster...being Egyptian?  Asking for a friend.<br />

+ Did whatever the hell they could to make the art seem interesting<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
&quot;Anoko ni Drop Kick&quot;, sung by the various seiyuu in this series, the OP is...a strange mix of heavy rock and your typical seiyuu song that kind of results in a mess of genres and just...sound that actually reflects this show to a tee.  Is it good?  Not really.  Is it interesting?  Oh definitely.  But probably not in the way that was intended when it was first made.  By comparison, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; by Yutarou Miura is an ED that has a more slice of life feel, especially when pitted against its opening sister.  That being said, it&#039;s still not that amazing of a song, and doesn&#039;t really have that memorabilia factor that I see as required when talking about good OP/EDs.  <br />
<br />
An interesting factoid about this show as well is the fact that all of the seiyuus for this show are all fairly new in the industry, and for what it&#039;s worth, Suzuki Aina, the voice for Jashin-chan, does a good job at portraying the character.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that this series of all existing manga would EVER get an adaptation.  When I stumbled upon its parent story one day, I swear it was some slapstick thing that wouldn&#039;t get a lot of traction.  Yet here we are writing a review for a project I thought would never get made.<br />
<br />
Having followed the original, I can safely say that this adaptation actually blew my expectations of what I would&#039;ve thought could come from a series like this.  It&#039;s clear that there wasn&#039;t a large budget and low production value for the project, yet even so, they still managed to make a decent series that worked for what it was.  I get the feeling that Nomad knew what they were doing when they made this, and just had fun with it despite everything.  Hell they even made a jab at the Comic Meteor, the publisher of the manga, for this series not being that profitable.  Even more so, I actually found the anime original content to actually be mostly beneficial to the series, adding more characters and thus more flavor to the weekly doses of lamia torture.  <br />
<br />
So as far as slapstick goes, Jashin-chan Dropkick despite a lot of factors stacked against it, manages to be a half decent comedy series worth watching to those wanting to get a little chuckle.  Like seriously, this is a helluva lot better than I was expecting coming from someone who read the original thing.

    The story does remind me of &quot;Gabriel Dropout&quot; I liked Gabriel Dropout. It was fun but I didn&#039;t like how the MC in that turned into a slob and rude being when she used to be an Honor student.<br />
<br />
I like the characters and find their Voice Acting, Designs and Personalities all good and interesting.<br />
<br />
Jashin Is a good character. I like her personality and design. I find it weird that for some reason she doesn&#039;t appear to have boobs. I also thought that Snake-Women should have big boobs. It just is what I&#039;ve always seen from those characters. I do like that she didn&#039;t use to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285169">
        have some sweet and charming personality but became a slob and rude like what Happened in &quot; Gabriel Dropout&quot; <br />
<br />
Medusa is probably my favorite or up there. I always like personalities like hers and I love her character design the most of all the characters. I do like the small amount of Yuri themed tensions between Jashin and Medusa.<br />
<br />
Yurine surprised me in the fact that I didn&#039;t find her to be annoying. I can easily see her personality to be obnoxious and her always beating Up Jashin could get bad if it wasn&#039;t done well. I also have had bad experiences with people wearing eye patches ( I.e Chuunibyou, I didn&#039;t like that show) So I&#039;m happy that I actually like her.<br />
<br />
Pekora I like. I do feel bad for her though. By the end of the show, I&#039;m wanting her to have found her Halo and return to heaven. Maybe have her get a task of returning to Earth and &quot;Watching&quot; The group. I also love the idea that God is up there in heaven watching a Tv laughing while all the stuff in the show happens.<br />
<br />
The cowgirl ( I can&#039;t remember her name) Might be interesting. But we&#039;ve gotten so little of her that it&#039;s hard to even judge her character at this point. <br />
<br />
The animation is also pretty good and has its own appeal to it. <br />
<br />
Overall this is a fun show and as of now, It&#039;s my favorite show of the season. Might have to do with me not being fully caught up on my shows and not being able to watch much of them/

    This show was very enjoyable for someone who likes comedy slice of life style anime. It has it&#039;s flaws on the story, the biggest one, for me, being the devil girl who is searching for Jashin-chan but due to comical reasons never finds her, and only gets a small glimpse of her in the last episode, it&#039;s funny, but it left me questioning what the point of this charter is. <br />
<br />
Another thing I found confusing in the the story is that it was never explained, unless you watch the theme song (which I skipped at first), how Yurine summoned Jashin-chan into the world, and instead,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289258">
        the first episode was just a normal episode that focused on the events after Yurine summoned Jashin-chan. <br />
<br />
Other than that, I honestly enjoyed the show, and would definitely recommend it if you&#039;re bored and want to binge on something funny. It was a really fun watch!

    So, I&#039;ve been watching this anime for a while now and yeah, I have to say this anime is awful, although  I&#039;m not gonna drop it. <br />
It&#039;s the blandest of all possible anime I have on my list, It&#039;s repettativ and boring at it&#039;s best.<br />
The artstile is not very appieling to me with it&#039;s thick lines and dark hard shadows, but the colorpalet brings everything to a new low.<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime  is nothing like Gabriel Dropout. Gabriel dropout features great characters, has an appealing artstyle and features slapstick comedy, while this has non of the above and features murder for comedic effect? Also the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288271">
        story is repettative.<br />
<br />
Now I only watch it for the murder scenes and scip through the boring stuff.

    This show should have been called Miss Kobiyashi has a sick and twisted neighbor who summoned a devil she repeatedly kills for insubordination.<br />
<br />
But simply this show is called &quot;Jashin-Chan Dropkick, and this has taken me away. I have a standard when it comes to anime, if you make me want to go and search out your light novel or manga, then 10/10 its a great product all around. <br />
<br />
A witch named Yurine Hanazono summons the serpent woman Jashin from Hell. Unable to go back to Hell by herself, Jashin spends each day unsuccessfully trying to kill Yurine while simultaneously spending time with her and various

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285333">
        acquaintances from Heaven and Hell.<br />
<br />
The brief look into the story is just half a layer of what this show truly peels out to. <br />
<br />
Pekola-Makes my heart hurt, my checks smile, and my eye well up with some sort of mix of tears of saddness and extreme laughter, this poor Angel with not halo nor money, who is on the street starving....will make you ach and laugh as she is at the mercy of the kindness of a witch (Yurine) while consistently be isolated taunted and chastised by the serpent devil  Jashin. <br />
<br />
The story its self overall presents its self in somewhat an episodic format, missing a week wont doom you. The episodes themselves play out in somewhat of a segment format with one episode running 3-4 segments all progressing towards the fall jashin and her next death by the hands of Yurine. <br />
<br />
Medusa- the enabler of jashin, typical ditzy attitude but is aware when people are trying to get over on her, good friend to Jashin enables her bad habits, but just wants to see her happy, the running gag is she wears a paper bag when in the human world <br />
<br />
Minos- A minatur demon who has no issues with eating beef, right now her character is just there she is more of the comedic relife, she doesn&#039;t enable Jashin but is quick to state obvious of the situation. <br />
<br />
This is a studio Nomad production most famously known for (Rozen Maiden) to sum up Studio Nomads work, its the nail that doesnt stick out, but does it job. Jashin Chan can be their breakaway. <br />
<br />
I cant say its unique it reminds me of Miss Kobiyashi&#039;s dragonmaid, I can say for an anime in that formula its worth your time and effort to watch. <br />
<br />
Story 8/10- Story is straight easy premise witch summons demon time for shenanigans <br />
<br />
Art-You seen Dragon? Maid well its pretty on points, production is not huge tons of breakway scenes involving action, lots of implied scenes, characters are animated well. simple colors pastel almost, but also still vibrant and pleasing .<br />
<br />
Sound- Its so so Great chain saw effect episode 1, weapons sound well thought out voice acting, is well, good soundtrack, the intro is one of my recent favorites. <br />
<br />
Characters- A witch summons a demon lord, whose friends, with medusa, and Minator demon, and there starving an fallen angel named pekalo (go watch the show) 10/10 <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- If i dont binge watch a show im loving it because i want to last. &quot;lets make this thing last forever and eva and eva......<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10

    	A gothic lolita witch, named Yurine, summons a demon snake girl from hell, named Jashin, to the human world. Jashin can’t go back to hell unless she kills Yurine, but until then, they’re living together. This is the basic synopsis of the Summer 2018 season’s, Jashin-chan no Dropkick! Jashin-chan no Dropkick is described by MAL as a supernatural comedy show, complete with demons, angels, and all of hell’s creatures on earth participating in this fun slapstick, bloody, slice of life adventure.<br />
<br />
	Jashin-chan no Dropkick is the newest addition to the newish genre known as monster girls. The 3 major demon girls, Jashin, Medusa, and Minosu, have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289462">
        the qualities of their mythical creature counter parts. Jashin wears no clothes and has the bottom of a snake, much like Miia from Monster Musume, with blond hair hiding her tits. Medusa wears ancient Egyptian attire and turns normal humans to stone when they look at her eyes. Minosu wears cow themed clothing and looks like what you think a typical cow girl would looks like. There’s also Pikola, who is an angel who has lost her halo and is stuck on earth until someone comes to pick her up, but in the meantime she’s homeless. She is also best girl.<br />
<br />
	As you can assume with this type of show, its mostly carried by the scenarios and personalities these characters bring to the table. Mostly interacting with the two protagonists, Yurine and Jashin. Jashin, being a demon, is a terrible person. She constantly does these deeply immoral things to the point it&#039;s even fucked up even for fiction. In reaction to this, Yurine often takes some overly comical weapon to do almost as awful thing to her back. Like bludgeoning her to death, or chopping up her tail and making it into stew, or sticking her into an iron maiden. You get it right? Yurine is a genuinely nice person despite her cold personality and the fact that she eviscerates Jashin everytime she does something horrible. Which is often. And she never learns. If Yurine wasn’t there to punish Jashin for her evil doings, then this show would just be a terrible person doing terrible things. Which wouldn’t be fun at all.<br />
<br />
	The show’s art and animation, in my opinion, is stellar for this type of show. For just some slice of life comedy it&#039;s pretty great. The characters have a chibi, shiny look to them with some fluid animation to boot. It really makes the slapstick hit harder. <br />
<br />
	In conclusion, Jashin-chan no Dropkick gets a 9 out of 10 for me this Summer anime season. I always looked forward to watching it after work on Monday’s. It&#039;s reminiscent to Gabriel Dropout, except more adult, if that makes sense. So if you like that, then give this show a shot. This has been PixEFit’s spoiler free, but not really review on Jashin-chan no Dropkick.<br />

    The story revolves around one of our main characters Yurine who has summoned the Demon Jashin-chan to Earth with no way to return her other then Yurine dying. Unfortunately for Jashin-chan her attempts in killing Yurine come up short constantly. Resulting in an hilarious outcome to which Yurine tortures Jashin-chan in different ways.<br />
There&#039;s no real story to this anime, and you are basically watching it for the interesting characters and comedy.<br />
<br />
The art and animation was different but I saw no major flaws with it.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending were really good. Very upbeat and Super fun.<br />
<br />
I actually found all the characters enjoyable...yes including Jashin-chan. Even though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289724">
        she was annoying most of the time she showed her soft side as well. Especially when dealing with Pekola on a certain few accounts.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this anime a lot. I thought the anime was very funny and a super fun show to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall I would recommend this anime to anyone who like an over the top comedy. This anime was basically a more intense Nichijou.

    [My rereview of Jashin-chan Dropkick. Last review I only saw 5 episodes, now I have seen all of them]<br />
<br />
One anime that I had a ton of mixed feelings about was Gabriel Dropout. It was a cute slice of life comedy centered around two demons and two angels living with each other. It was pretty good overall, but it had some big issues like unlikable characters and some cringy moments. Jashin-chan Dropkick is basically Gabriel Dropout, but instead of focussing on the character interactions it focuses on something else. What is that something else I am talking about? Well, get chainsaws and bank accounts ready, this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289294">
        is my review of Jashin-chan Dropkick. <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
In this universe demons and angels come to earth to do things that are never showed or explained. Jashin-chan is summoned into the world by Yurine and now has to kill Yurine to get back to hell. The big problem is that Jashin-chan has no home now so she lives with Yurine and Yurine does not hold back to punish Jashin-chan. A side story that also gets focus is a friend of Jashin-chan and Yurine: Pekora the angel. After losing her halo she now is homeless and has to not only survive this world, but also from another angel Poporon. The story is pretty original for what it is and goes some unexpected turns.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
The animation is really basic and kinda below average for this kind of show, but the colours, the visual references and expressions more then make up for it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The opening and ending are good for what hey are, but what I love about the OST is that they remix the opening in different ways. I love when people do this kind of stuff and the remixes kick ass on their own!<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
The main cast consists of five people: Jashin-chan (aka a more dickish version of Satania from Gabriel Dropout) is the pathetic devil who loves to slack of and is a dick to her friends. Yurine is the silent demon and doesn’t hold back when punishing Jashin-chan for being a dick. Medusa is easily manipulated cutie who is friends with Jashin-chan. Pekora is the confident angel who gets easily persuaded by food. Then there is Minosu. She has no personality except of her being a thick cow. The biggest problem I have is Jashin-chan. Jashin-chan can be extremely unlikable at times and gets away with stuff way too easily or gets punished way too hard. Despite that, this is a really enjoyable cast.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
This anime was really refreshing for me. Even though the majority of humor came from Yurines very graphic punishments, they cover the whole humor spectrum: Slapstick, references, meta humor, puns, all kinds of humor you can think of. It first seem like the anime can’t decide on its tone, but after a while it was obviously that the anime didn’t care about a consistent tone or a nuanced story, it just wants to make you laugh and not feel old.  <br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
This was a pleasant surprise of an anime. I recommend this anime if you just want to watch a dumb anime with a dark undertone and a wide range of humor.<br />

    A snake demon, medusa and a minotaur walks into a teenager&#039;s apartment room...<br />
<br />
Jashin-chan Dropkick is to be honest, a fairly typically slapstick comedy anime, with all the knicks and running gags you&#039;d expect. If there was a likely comparison LA would put on Jashin-chan Dropkick, then it would be in a similar comedic genre as Gabriel Dropout, heck they even have the entire angels and demon thing, character degrading jokes, just swap out the main protagonist wanting to have a NEET life with the main protagonist now wanting to kill her summoner in order to go back to hell and failing every chance she gets.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289270">
        Both animes really have the slapstick comedy down just that Jashin-chan Dropkick being in the more physically violent compared to Gabriel Dropout&#039;s more verbal insults.<br />
<br />
OK, so comparisons out of the way, so how is Jashin-chan Dropkick&#039;s comedy as a standalone, well with many comedies, have their running gags and much like Gabriel Dropout, runs it&#039;s running gags to the ground, be it in different settings you KNOW where the gags are going once it initiates itself every time. Jashin-chan Dropkick also is meta as many of it&#039;s characters KNOWS it&#039;s an anime and gives jokes about it knowing it&#039;s an anime whenever it wants the main user being Jashin-chan herself. Really Jashin-chan Dropkick&#039;s comedy runs the gambit of comedy tropes within the setting of &quot;demons or monsters + slapstick comedy&quot;, like honestly the comedy isn&#039;t that horrible, LA did laugh at it&#039;s jokes but only when the jokes were one-off witty banter and outside the typical running gags. Jashin-chan Dropkick&#039;s comedy is mediocre but typically competent mediocre comedy nonetheless.<br />
<br />
LA really didn&#039;t go into it&#039;s characters so let&#039;s move onto that. The titular Jashin-chan voiced by Aina Suzuki is the butt monkey of the anime and for one of the main protagonist...yeah it&#039;s a slapstick comedy alright, the summoner and one dishing out the dirt to Jashin-chan being Yurine Hanazono voiced by Nichika Oomori and she&#039;s the stoic snake killing-eating no sell lolita teenager. Other cast members are Medusa voiced by Miyu Tomita, a shy, naive and gullible character that is an utter pushover towards Jashin-chan, Minosu voiced by Chiaki Omigawa as the hyper genki, active character and Pekora voiced by Yurie Kozakai, a fallen angel who&#039;s now in poverty and is also the other butt monkey of the anime, but not has harsh as Jashin-chan but Pekora falls under the character with just bad misfortune, Jashin-chan on the other hand is a total idiot all the time and all her troubles is it&#039;s mainly her OWN FAULT. Ultimately, the entire cast are cookie-cutter with their quirks and not much else besides most of their running gags driving alot of the quirky plots that appears, sometimes by Jashin&#039;s self-made situations. <br />
<br />
There are three minor characters beyond the main cast, which is the in-universe narrator Devil himself giving little tidbits after or in-between skits, Kouji and Yusa voiced by Miko Terada and Kazusa Aranami, two yuki-onna&#039;s  where Jashin-chan&#039;s superiorty complex kicks in and boomranged, they also make kakigori jokes because...their yuki-onna&#039;s, Mei Tachibana voiced by Natsuko Hara, a police officer, obsessed with having Jashin-chan in her *ahem* collection and will abuse her power as an officer to ger her way and finally Poporon voiced by Rico Sasaki, an angel and once subordinate of Pekora but she&#039;s not exactly a pure angel and that&#039;s her joke once Jashin-chan gets involved. Much like it&#039;s main cast, they all have their stereotypical hijinks and personalities and running gags that they use whenever they appear.<br />
<br />
With that being said, Jashin-chan is an utter troll of a main protagonist, narcissistic and having a superiority complex to the point of harassing low-level demons. But Jashin-chan has her moments showing she is sympathetic in some sense, this is mainly focused on Medusa and in the final episode to Yurine to re-focus it&#039;s efforts back onto the main premise and everything, but to the rest of the cast..not so much but still seeing another side of Jashin-chan is a good thing. Nonetheless Jashin-chan is the narrative drive of the anime, both of being the main protagonist and the hoist of her own petard alot of the time, creating many of the skits at least having her actions leading to consequences...mainly death by Yurine and then forgotten the next episode...because of course it does. <br />
<br />
In terms of animation by Nomad, well the animation was expected moe and chibiness for the more comedic styled moments, but due to Jashin-chan&#039;s deaths being a thing, well many of the animation does get gory...or in this case for slice of life comedy, immensely bloody to say the least. Really, the animation was just decent for such a slapstick comedy, no hyper craziness but instead it downgrades and goes the chibi route for it&#039;s overreactions just adding in the blood factor which it becomes intentionally censored because comedy. Character designs are of course distinct because of the entire angel and demons thing and Yurine is being one of the only exotic character but with most of the minor characters being unhinged and slapstick crazy in some sense as well, makes many of the characters blending in, yet knowing what their running gags are. Nomad nonetheless had some good yet expected animation for a violent slapstick comedy. <br />
<br />
Voice acting was both a blend of new blood voice actors (like Pekora&#039;s VA Yurie Kozakai) and idol (anime or real life) like Aina Suzuki and Miyu Tomita. Well LA is seeing a trend with &quot;it&#039;s joke&quot; VA due to LA watching Jashin-chan Dropkick which is that Aina Suzuki has been typecasted as the no shits-given psycho character like Rina Shioi from Mahou Shoujo Site and now Jashin, only she&#039;s dialed down because comedy. Overall, the voice work was to be expected and for what LA expected from such a slapstick comedy and where many of the character voices matched their characters but the cast is expected even with their line deliveries, but not much else however. At least because Jashin-chan Dropkick is meta in a sense...and yes they go meta jokey on it&#039;s voice cast too...especially towards Miyu Tomita.<br />
<br />
Jashin-chan Dropkick is a mediocre yet still funny slapstick comedy, LA won&#039;t put it past it&#039;s characters and their running gags but nonetheless, it&#039;s running gags are run down the ground, Jashin-chan shot herself on the foot almost every chance she gets, Medusa is always naive, Minosu is always hyper active, Pekora is always poor and Yurine will always beat the shit out of Jashin-chan whenever she does something wrong. It&#039;s predictable as hell and it&#039;s meta jokes are fine but not groundbreaking and through this, it just makes Jashin-chan Dropkick just...fine yet predictable, not a great comedy through taking risks much like Asobi Asobase from the same season, but not utterly horrible because of it&#039;s constant running gags. Jashin-chan Dropkick really does deliver what it&#039;s premise is front and center and not much else but still it was a comedy that LA still watched all the way through but not wanting more.<br />
<br />
Since LA only watched 3 comedies during the Summer of 2018, it was definitely the weakest of the trio but being the &quot;weakest&quot; doesn&#039;t resort to being horrible and that just where Jashin-chan Dropkick landed for LA&#039;s judgment towards it...mediocre, yet fun...but not much else.

    Very funny. This anime has it all, slice of like, demons, comedy, 4th wall break and well placed PG gore.<br />
At the time of writing this i have only watched one episode of it and i have already fallen in love with this anime. The anime has such unique and relatable characters that will make you laugh or chuckle, every part of this anime is highly enjoyable. I normally don&#039;t watch this kind of anime but watching this makes me want to wish there were more like it. Overall, this anime is good for anyone looking for a bit of a laugh and spare time on

    This sho is good if you want background noise and the occasional laugh. Most of the show has no real plot just goth girl getting pissed at snake girl. the only thing that is really different is how bad of a personality the snake girl has. Most characters with that bad of personality have a reason like being jealous or lonely, ect. But this girl is just mean I would want to kill her just like goth girl. The other characters are also really basic not real depth to them.<br />
<br />
once again this show is good background noise thats it really.

    To enjoy #jcdkm, you should watch it with a different set of expectations. This anime is like a fusion of comedy and b-list gore/horror movie. It&#039;s no where as  &#039;softcore&#039; as Gabriel drop out and just tiny bit short of the more hardcore Dokuro-chan.<br />
<br />
jcdk has its own set of appeal. For those expecting Gabriel Drop out with more cutesy Everyday Life, this will disappoint. and it&#039;s very aware of its target audience.<br />
<br />
For most, you either GET jcdk or you don&#039;t. it&#039;s really a double-edged sword, since for those who GET it, it&#039;s very enjoyable, and offers sort of nostalgic piece of mind every week.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288375">
        For the general English anime watching community, jcdk type anime is most likely bland/repetitive/pointless voilence, etc, and probably not to their taste. This is quite evident between the review score here and the largest Chinese anime streaming site bilibili. Some of the jokes are even hard to translate into English, and this anime relies a lot more on ojii-san gag, and so it lacks some &#039;punch.&#039;<br />
<br />
If you liked gabriel drop out you may or may not like this anime because Gabriel had a more familiar tone that&#039;s closer to the Hobunsha type anime (kiniro mozaic, rabbit, etc.). But if you liked Dokuro-chan you probably will like this anime.

    The classic mantra of “Watch three episodes before deciding to drop an anime” saved this one for me. (Though realistically it was more like four or five.)<br />
<br />
Dropkick On My Devil has a rough start. Literally — it drops you right into the story with no explanation. Hopefully you read the synopsis, but even if you did it’s a stilted introduction. From there, it plays out like you’d expect from reading the synopsis: Jashin-chan tries to kill Yurine in some way, fails, then gets a gory punishment. There are things like supporting character interactions to make each section long enough, but that’s the general gist of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375270">
        it…but only to a point. <br />
<br />
If you’re coming here to see how many murder ideas and fatalities the writer could come up with, you won’t get much of that here.<br />
<br />
Before getting into that though, the question might be “What makes this beginning part so unenjoyable?” The biggest problem is Jashin-chan — the main character — being insufferable. She’s cocky, annoying, and cruel. The point is probably to make her that way so her getting what she deserves (and then some) is satisfying. But personally she was just making the whole experience unenjoyable for me. Adding plenty of fourth wall breaking and random stuff on top of that was more annoying than anything. (You might also not like the fact that she’s always naked for the entire anime sans a couple of segments.)<br />
<br />
However, by around Episode 3, the anime starts to change. First, the whole “murder” plot of the anime stops happening for the most part. Jashin-chan only has the occasional thoughts of killing Yurine. Yurine subsequently doesn’t maim her too much, mainly only doing so for minor things like Jashin-chan being rude or lying.  The violence that’s inflicted is turned down as well. From here, the anime becomes more of a slice-of-life that follows how its peculiar characters go about their random days. If you came here for the actual premise of the anime, you’ll no-doubt be disappointed. However, a fan of the slice-of-life genre might find it to be noticeably more pleasant because…<br />
<br />
Jashin-chan also becomes much more bearable. Her being mean can still get frustrating at times, but other times she can even be a jerk with a heart of gold. Thus her antics (and punishments) start becoming comedic. She still lacks the art of being an enjoyable scumbag like the cast in KonoSuba or It&#039;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, but I&#039;ll take it. (And for the record, I think this subdued Jashin-chan could’ve worked while still having her focus on murdering Yurine.)<br />
<br />
Still, a lot of the supporting cast tend to be Jashin-chan’s punching bags. Medusa is so adorable that she would bump my score up by a point alone…if her appearances didn’t come with the dread of Jashin-chanin evitable (and boldly) abusing her for her money. Pekora’s a forsaken angel who’s homeless but tries her best, making her an easy target for Jashin-chan as well. Another angel has a rivalry with her. And a couple of yuki-onna sisters are bullied by her as well.<br />
<br />
The only characters that don’t get abused by Jashin-chan are Minos and Yurine. The former probably gets no screen time because of this, which is a shame since her pep is always nice. The latter obviously discourages Jashin-chan’s bad behavior and retaliates. It’s great that she’s so kind-hearted despite her deadpan face and violent tendencies. I suppose the cop also counts, but she barely shows up which I think is a good thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks to Dropkick On My Devil mostly dropping its plot after a few episodes, it’s hard to recommend to people hoping for a lot of that. And since it can take up to five episodes to start becoming enjoyable, it’s also hard to recommend to people who don’t care for the plot too much. But if those aren’t enough to deter you, I’d say I surprisingly ended up enjoying watching the episodes by the end. At least, enough to want to see what else these characters do in a second season.

    Ok, I was surprised to discover that this show was a huge hit everywhere that people wanted another season of it. I found this when I was strolling through Amazon Prime, honestly and completely unaware of its existence and how, thanks to crowdfunding according to MAL, another season is in possible production. <br />
<br />
So, a demon that gets sent to Earth through a summoning ritual by a girl obsessed with dark magic. Of course, the objective for Jashin-chan is to kill her summoner so she can return to hell but has a hard time assassinating her. <br />
<br />
I had a good time watching the show; it&#039;s one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397503">
        of the shows where you may or may not get used to Jashin-chan dying most of the time. Since it&#039;s the case with some shows, I&#039;m used to it. <br />
<br />
What I liked:<br />
Definitely one of gore fans; sometimes it won&#039;t appeal to everyone since we all have limits. Good OP and some 4th wall breaking humour felt a little refreshing for me. <br />
<br />
What I disliked:<br />
You think there would be more creative injuries with Jashin-chan; some harm on her I thought wasn&#039;t bad but wasn&#039;t enough to say, &quot;Wow, that&#039;s new.&quot; Hopefully they will solve this in the next season I watch (I recently know there&#039;s a season 2 and of course, season 3 is getting made). <br />
<br />
Out of all of this, it&#039;s a 7 on my end. You may rate it higher but that&#039;s your opinion. Have a good day.
