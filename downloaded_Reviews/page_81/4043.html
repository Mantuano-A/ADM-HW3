    Story<br />
Some aspects of the setup I liked, like the school divided into day class human students and night class vampire students.  I would have loved the human heroine who patrols the grounds and night, making sure the vampires are  in line, except...Yuki was TOTALLY lame. Episode after episode was her chasing after Zero, stupidly getting herself into danger, being saved by a male lead, and then feeling guilty.  Really weak story, with few redeeming features.  The characters didn&#039;t grow, events didn&#039;t build up into a climax, and the resolution was contrived and lukewarn.  It was very much one of those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15818">
        animes annoyingly full of longing, melodramatic gazes and characters saying each others&#039; names in quiet, tortured voices.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art was all right.  Yuki was cute, Zero was handsome, and Kaname was gorgeous.  The other vampires were pretty lame though, just a bunch of generic bishounen who were totally loyal to Kaname cuz the mangaka said so.  I found Yuki&#039;s absolutely massive eyes irritating.  I&#039;ve seen a lot of anime by now so I&#039;m used to the huge eyes, but hers actually distracted me at times, maybe because the story had so little pull.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Good soundtrack.  Lots of classical, which I enjoyed, and I like both the intro and ending songs.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The characters are what I disliked the most, especially Yuki.  She was an extremely boring protagonist.  She carried around a cool-looking staff that seemed to have magical properties, but never once used it well.  Usually, she&#039;d just bring it out only to drop it when someone said something upsetting or when she tripped.  She was then promptly rescued by Kaname or Zero.  Maybe the next season will explain why she is in the middle of all of this, but I think season 1 should give the heroine SOME value.  Sure, she was very generous with Zero, but I hate shoujo heroines who only stand out because they&#039;re SO good at being martyrs.  As for the other characters, they weren&#039;t much better.  Zero spent most of his time wanting to die.  Kaname constantly rescued Yuki, yet never explained her importance to him.  A little mystery is good, but too much &quot;she&#039;s so precious to me but I won&#039;t say why&quot; gets boring and annoying.  The &quot;villain&quot; only appeared at the very, very end, and I found their behavior inconsistent and what happened to them way too abrupt and anticlimactic.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I don&#039;t have high standards.  I might&#039;ve adored this show, if Yuki hadn&#039;t been such a weakling.  What I usually enjoy in anime shows is watching the protagonist learn and grow.  It&#039;s okay if the protagonist starts out ordinary or weak or with a massive crush, so long as they become stronger.  Yuki really didn&#039;t, though.  Kaname kept protecting her without explaining anything.  Zero usually pushed her away and also refused to share things.  She had a big heart, but I like heroines who&#039;re genuinely strong, not just good at sacrificing themselves.  Sorry, but anyone can say, &quot;Bite me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Maybe this is a good show for teenage girls, but I think anyone who just finished Ouran Host Club or Hana Yori Dango or other such shows will be disappointed by the heroine.  Most shoujo is so entertaining because the heroines are so intelligent, or plucky, or independent.  Yuki was none of those things.  Of course, fangirls who just want to see a cute big-eyed girl get bitten by various bishounen will still love it.

    If you think that shojo series are all flowery, romantic (comedies) and cheerful, you&#039;re quite wrong, and Vampire Knight will prove that more than anything else. Keywords for VK are drama, emotional struggles and tragic pasts. Throw in a dash of vampire, and there you have Vampire Knight in all its glory.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around the students of the Cross Academy, which is divided into the Day Class for humans, and the Night Class for Vampires. The main characters, Zero and Yuki, both have very sad pasts; Zero had his family killed by a vampire, and Yuki&#039;s first memory was a vampire attacking her. These

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6483">
        pasts, which are revealed fairly early in the series, make a good base for their relationship and their emotional struggles.<br />
<br />
During the course of the story, the characters face one event/experience after another, which makes room for emotional struggles, lots of character development and, of course, some romance (hey, this is a shojo series after all), though the latter is overshadowed by the other stuff.<br />
<br />
The artwork is both standard shojo and something else at the same time. We have the pretty bishonen boys in place, complete with all the fallen-head-over-heels girls, and there&#039;s also the standard shojo eyes; large, with pupils that are almost larger than the actual eyes. But since the series has a darker, sadder tone to it, there&#039;s no lack on that end either. The coloring is often very dark, and the occasional lighting effect helps on this aspect of the series. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is good, with sad pieces helping the sad mood, and overall good quality. There&#039;s nothing spectacular about the soundtrack though, and while the OP theme is very good, the ED theme isn&#039;t very cool, though it fits with the dark mood of the series. Voice acting is perfect; the moods are portrayed very well and there&#039;s an overall good quality.<br />
<br />
One of the things I love about this series is the characters. I mean, I really love them. They&#039;re very deep, with their pasts and emotional struggles. Off course, there&#039;s superficial characters as well, but they&#039;re mostly supporting characters; the main characters are mostly deep and they have a lot of character development for such a short series. Their relationships with eachother are very deep too, and a pleasure to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the series very much; this is a candidate for the best Spring 2008 anime. It&#039;s a bit open at the end, but I just read that there&#039;s a second season coming in October, so I&#039;ll accept that, and look forward to it.<br />
<br />

    Well, since some people exactly like my reviews, I decided to do another one. This time, it&#039;s Vampire Knight. I&#039;ve only seen 3 episodes and read some manga chapters, even through I can&#039;t consider myself as the VK-girl that knows everything, I know quite alot about the story and the characters. Anyway, here we go!<br />
<br />
Story - 100% [10]<br />
If you haven&#039;t read the manga or saw some episodes of the anime, you&#039;ll probably already have an idea what this is about... Vampires. I say that you&#039;re right, but if you watch or read Vampire Knight, you&#039;ll find out that it&#039;s more than only &#039;&#039;vampires&#039;&#039;. Let&#039;s start

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4312">
        with the beginning.<br />
<br />
Vampire Knight revolves between Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Yuki and Zero are Cross-Academy&#039;s prefects (guardians). It&#039;s their duty to prevent the contact between the Day and the Night-class, even through it&#039;s very hard for them because all the girls from the Day-class have a big crush on the guys from the Night-class, that&#039;s not very rare because everyone in the Night-class looks gorgeous. Why are prefects needed? To prevent the Day-class of finding out the secret from the Night-class, in reality, all of them are vampires. The &#039;&#039;leader&#039;&#039; of the Night-class is Kaname Kuran, the one who saved Yuki&#039;s life when she was little. Ofcourse he&#039;s a vampire too and the most powerful of all, a pureblood. Yuki and Zero both live with the chairmain of Cross-Academy, Cross Kaien. Yuki doesn&#039;t have any memories from when she was a kid, her memories begin on the day that Kaname saved her from a vampire. Kaname asked the chairman to look after her, and he did. The same goes of Zero, a couple of years later he comes to live with Yuki and the chairmain to, after his parents where killed by a vampire.<br />
<br />
What is so loveable about all this? Both the anime and the manga have a mysterious feeling to it, that you know that something is going on but you don&#039;t know what. You&#039;ll also notice and the story gets &#039;&#039;darker&#039;&#039; each time, and that the characters change. It takes a while until you really understand everything because they tell you the story bit by bit, you may also expect some big changes, I warn you. I wish that I could tell you more, but I don&#039;t want to spoil it for you guys. I really recommend you guys both the manga and the anime.<br />
<br />
Animation - 80% [8]<br />
Well, the animation. I must say that it&#039;s alot better than I expected. Still, I know that alot of manga-fans might be dissapointed. The manga might have better art, but I think that the anime is really well made. They put alot of effort in this, and with succes. If the manga didn&#039;t excist, the anime would probably get higher ratings. Well, my opinion is that that the Vampire Knight anime is a good adaptation to the manga, I really think so.<br />
<br />
Sound -  90% [9]<br />
The sound, or better said, the music. The songs that the picked for both the opening and ending where really the right choice for this anime. Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi is the opening-song, sung by ON/OFF, and I really love it. It really matches the anime and gives you the Vampire Knight-feeling. I really like it. Then, for the ending-song, Still Doll sung by Wakeshima Kanon, was the biggest plus-point for me. I just loved it the first time that I heard it! How come? It&#039;s mysterious and matches Vampire Knight perfectly. When you listen to it, I&#039;m sure that you&#039;ll also get the feeling that there&#039;s something that you don&#039;t know yet. For the soundeffects in this anime, I have nothing to complain. When you needed one, you got one, just how it is in real life. The good sound in Vampire Knight made it realistic.<br />
<br />
Character - 100% [10]<br />
Ha, this was a easy one. The characters, you&#039;ll absolutely love them when you get to know them! What is good about this is that you don&#039;t only get to know Yuki, Zero and Kaname, but also the other people from the Night-Class and other random characters. Let&#039;s take Aidou as an example, he&#039;s not a main character, still, you know exactly who he is! I&#039;ll tell you something about the 3 main characters now.<br />
<br />
Yuki - I think that you all know her type of character, but Yuki is not the typical &#039;&#039;shoujo&#039;&#039; heroine. No, she&#039;s different. You can see that she tries her best to help Zero and get a place in his heart, she really cares alot for others, which might also be her weakness. To save Zero from turning into a Level E, she let him drink her blood. Yuki was attacked as a little girl by a vampire who was fallen to a Level E, and than was saved by Kaname. She has no memories of her parents or who she really is. Because Kaname saved her, she has a great affection for him, and she trusts the vampires in the Night-Class.<br />
<br />
Zero - He might look like a cold-hearted guy in the beginning, but he really isn&#039;t. Zero&#039;s family where killed by a vampire, that&#039;s why he really hates vampires, all of them. Anyway, in the beginning of the series you&#039;ll see him in pain a couple of times, I think alot of you got the picture back then. Yes, when he was attacked he was biten by a vampire, a pureblood. Since he didn&#039;t die he will slowly turn into a vampire himself. Since his huge hate for vampires, she fights against the progress with all his might. Zero always has a gun with him, he can use it to kill vampires. He also has a younger twin-brother named Ichiru, but he was not as healthy as Zero (no, he didn&#039;t die).<br />
<br />
Kaname - A pureblood vampire who&#039;s respected by everyone in the Night-Class, no, better said, he&#039;s the leader. When he gives an order, it&#039;s final. Other vampires fear him and he&#039;s loved by alot of girls from the Day-Class. Even through he doesn&#039;t really care about them, he does care alot for Yuki, which you&#039;ll notice right away. You&#039;ll understand later why a vampire with so much power as Kaname cares so much for a normal girl like Yuki.<br />
<br />
I think I told you enough, the point is, the characters WIN!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 100% [10]<br />
Enjoyment? Do you even need to ask? I REALLY enjoy this. It&#039;s a burden to wait for the episodes to air, but we have no other choice but wait, have we? If you like a mysterious story, vampires and some scary moments, watch Vampire Knight. I&#039;ll probably recommend this to everyone because this is something that everyone would like.<br />
<br />
Overall - 90% [9]<br />
What? Miss &#039;&#039;I enjoy-it-so-much&#039;&#039;, you didn&#039;t gave it a 10!<br />
Yes, people, I know what you&#039;re thinking. But you guys must remember, that I&#039;d also like to see this from another point of view. Since I have also read a part of the manga, I know how it could have been. I really think that the people who made the Vampire Knight-anime did an awesome job! If you see the original when reading the manga, you might understand why I gave this a 9. Don&#039;t forget to watch it now, I&#039;ll hunt you!<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Vampire Knight is an awesome anime/manga with very enjoyable characters and a story! It might be one of the &#039;&#039;must-see&#039;s&#039;&#039;. Judge for yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, minna! This was my review! I hope you didn&#039;t dislike it that much, I tried my best in writing it! Love, Erisu...<br />

    WARNING-- before reading this review, please take into account the fact that I disliked Vampire Knight. If that one statement offends you, please do not read onward. I do not assume any responsibilities for broken monitors, laptops, or mobile devices. <br />
<br />
Also, if you like dark romance or any romance dealing with vampires, I recommend this to you. See if you like it. Though, if you prefer adventures or are not a fan of things dark, or of soap operas, this is not recommended. <br />
<br />
..:::..:::..<br />
<br />
No matter what anime it is, the very first question that ever comes to my mind when writing  review is this--

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52545">
        &quot;Where do I start? What do I say?&quot;<br />
<br />
With Vampire Knight, that question never occurred. I know instantly where to start. Since I&#039;m such a freak about certain things, when I write reviews I have to write them in this order-- Story, Art, Sound, Character, All in all. but with this anime-- JUST this one-- I&#039;m going to start with Character, because that is where I know to start and where I feel I need to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character~<br />
Yes. Here we go. /deep breath/ Vampire Knight&#039;s characters are... awful. Hate me if you wish, but honestly, they&#039;re just annoying. This show isn&#039;t *insanely* popular, but it is well known, and I have a large share of romance anime-loving friends, and each one of them referred me to this. I don&#039;t see why. The characters all have their own tortured pasts and this makes it pretty much uninteresting. It&#039;s ok if people have a hard enough past to make them interesting-- and not to mention STRONGER-- but Vampire Knight does not do this. They just get weaker because of how hard their past is. I&#039;ll... show you.<br />
<br />
Yuki~<br />
The supposed heroine, an amnesiac with the only memory of when she was being attacked by a vampire when she was littler. Anything before that, she does not know. She carries around a weapon and is a night guard of sorts, keeping the Night Class and Day Class separate. Does she do a good job at this? ...No. Yuki must always be saved, and whenever she cries someone&#039;s name they will come. The plot and characters were all so predictable that, when Yuki fell over and dropped her weapon, the next thing she&#039;d do would be call someone&#039;s name. That person would then come and completely kick the butt of her attackers. Yay. I predicted this every time, and every time it happened just as it happened in my mind. Yuki was not a heroine, but was nothing more than a weak girl who supposedly wanted to help Zero by sacrificing some of her blood to him. People regenerate blood, vampire (...probably) or human, so it&#039;s not too much of a sacrifice. They&#039;ll just get it back later. Nothing special there. And in return for giving her red liquid to him, Zero would come save her. Her weapon&#039;s only purpose was to be flung around or dropped when she was surprised or something. She irritated me so much that-- ...No, I won&#039;t say.<br />
<br />
Zero~<br />
...Oh heck. He&#039;s just a suicidal guy who has a &quot;secret&quot;. He&#039;s a vampire. Wooooo. Who knew that was coming? /sarcasm/ All he does is regret his past and be all pathetic over it, and instead of developing he just sits and sighs sadly. Oh, and when Yuki calls out, he rescues her. I think he&#039;s rather torn between liking Yuki or not, or maybe it&#039;s just his oh-so-pathetic-feel-bad-for-me past, but he just bugged the crap out of me. Perhaps I am being much too critical for anyone&#039;s taste, but I feel I need to agree with some of those that gave this a bad review, and point out why. There&#039;s really no character development here, and when the characters are supposed to develop, it actually just makes them more annoying. There are so many things to dislike about this overused type of personality that I won&#039;t even point them out, or nobody would read my review because I could make a book out of it. But I&#039;ll share a few-- as I&#039;ve stated earlier, he&#039;s suicidal, yes, but he&#039;s also a bit cold and unsociable and fights with his own emotions. Doesn&#039;t he have another side to him? He never really reveals one. At least not in this series. So far, I don&#039;t think even Vampire Knight: Guilty could bring to life this pathetic show, but I have high hopes for it...<br />
<br />
Kaname~<br />
Do I HAVE to talk about him? Auuugh... He&#039;s just your average super strong, top of the class, well-liked guy with a &quot;soft side&quot; for the protagonist, Yuki. It seems that Kaname and Zero&#039;s roles are equal-- to &quot;provide drama&quot; (yeah, great job at that.) and save Yuki all. the. freaking. time. Yes, he&#039;s a vampire, and all this other purely annoying stuff, so why does he like Yuki so much? She&#039;s cute? She&#039;s helpless? She&#039;s &quot;kind&quot;? I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m hoping it will be revealed in Vampire Knight: Guilty, but I really don&#039;t know. Though, I&#039;m sure it will, because how could an anime go on like this? He seems so obsessed with Yuki (and Yuki so obsessed with him) that it&#039;s just stupid. Why? I want answers, and I want them in the next season. If I don&#039;t get them, this show will be in my list of &quot;Worst 5 anime I have ever seen&quot;. So, yes, if they reveal some of their secrets, I&#039;ll be... uh, happy. I guess. But for the most part, Kaname is a guy who doesn&#039;t make sense, and he&#039;s too much of a mystery. Mysteries, yes. But I can only take so much of &quot;I&#039;m keeping everything to myself and acting cool yet obsessed with this girl for no reason&quot;. Auuuugh. I just... no. Never mind. If I go further, I&#039;ll be ranting for the entire day, which I don&#039;t have time to do, so let&#039;s move on.<br />
<br />
Other characters~<br />
Wait, there were other characters? Wow! I hadn&#039;t even noticed! Oh, now that you say it, I do remember some of them. they were Kaname&#039;s followers, right? And they had such cliche personalities that I could die? Yeah, them! Right... If your brain is working properly, you should already know my opinion of the supporting cast by now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story~<br />
It seemed to be just slightly unique, and it had many places it could have gone, but it decided to stay as a stupid soap opera. It never really got deeper or darker than that, and the bad guy was sort of non existent until the very end. Weird. I like to be introduced to my antagonist at the very beginning, if possible. This was just one of the thousands of things that disappointed me in this show. Why everyone loves this is just something my brain can&#039;t grasp. I dunno, maybe your brain can&#039;t grasp why the heck I love Higurashi or Death Note, so let&#039;s leave it at this-- it&#039;s an opinion. The end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art~<br />
All in all, it was typical, yet with a darker sense of feeling. It really made me wonder how the heck the creator(s) did this. I mean, how do you take cliche art and give it a darker feeling to it? all in all, it was nice and enjoyable... but then the fight scenes came on. I mean, really? Just because it&#039;s a supposed romance doesn&#039;t mean the movement of the battles has to be completely awful. And trust me, ohhhh-- when mistakes in a frame are made, it was dang obvious. Most of the time in anime, I can tell when a mistake is made yet I can&#039;t always place it, but I know it&#039;s there. With Vampire Knight, that never happened once. I always knew where the mistakes were-- Yuki&#039;s face was too long. Her mouth was in the incorrect place. Zero&#039;s eye shape is wrong (and no, not because he&#039;s making a different expression, his eye shape is literally wrong). So many other things. So, when it is bad, it is very bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound~<br />
I enjoyed the opening, and... I actually have the ending on my iPod. I loved it. I have no idea why. There was something creepy yet mysterious and beautiful about it. It&#039;s not super special, but I liked it, and that&#039;s my opinion. The overall soundtrack for the movie was actually very nice, and I noticed *most* of it. It kind of helped enhance the mood, but most of the time it made it cheesier and more annoying. On its own, though, it&#039;s a fairly good soundtrack. The voice acting for the Japanese isn&#039;t necessarily anything super special-- each voice actor fits their role. And you know my opinion on the characters, so sometimes the voice acting was really annoying too. They sulk in the darkness of their rooms, softly calling out the name of the other character, their heart aching-- yeah, yeah. It gets annoying. If there&#039;s an English version, I didn&#039;t watch it, so...<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, Vampire Knight to me was very annoying and cliche in some of its parts. I hoped that it would go in a different direction since the overall setup of the plot was enthralling, but it went absolutely nowhere-- and I could only groan at the screen and slap my forehead. <br />
<br />
Depending on your taste in anime, you might or might not like this. I&#039;d say, just to be safe, read the other reviews and build an opinion of your own before you watch this anime. Mostly, read as many reviews that give it a bad score, then read a few that give it an 8 or above. Decide what you want to do, and watch or don&#039;t watch this. If you&#039;ve already seen it, then... good for you. Write your own review. If my review upset you in any way, please read the statement at the very top of this review. :P<br />
<br />
Overall, I just disliked this anime, and I&#039;ll stick with what I usually like. There were so many ways it could have gone, and so many twists it could have taken-- but it stayed annoying, predictable, and just... Ugh.

    If you like pretty anime vampire boys, this might be right up your street. However, if you like something with a decent plot as well as the associated carnage and animalistic nature that vampires usually have, this will likely leave you somewhat disappointed (and that&#039;s me being rather kind..) and wishing it had delivered more for the time you put in.<br />
<br />
I began watching this on a friend&#039;s giddy recommendation and was intrigued somewhat by the first few episodes; although, all the way through near enough, it stayed at the same steady pace of mild intrigue and a general niggling wonder as to when the hell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8810">
        the plot was going to kick in so that the story had some sort of point to it aside from a glorified love triangle. The plot itself, somewhere beneath the anime itself, has a lot of potential. The on-screen variation just doesn&#039;t seem to deliver.<br />
<br />
The characters, despite my &#039;fangirl-esque&#039; fondness of a fair few of them, aren&#039;t particularly well mapped out and a lot of the character basis is shrouded in mystery, although not really in the right way - there are far too many vague bits and not enough explanation when it comes to motive and persona as well as situation. In fact, most of the characters seem not only 2D, but slight variations of the same 2D character. Also, most of the vampires you encounter in this series are rather fluffy aside from the pointy fangs, and the supporting cast are, to a fair extent, pretty forgettable.<br />
<br />
Visually, it was somewhat pleasing, although a lot of time seems to have been wasted on trivial matters while the potentially good bits have been glossed over or given a moment or two of screen time when they should have had a scene, or at the very least, *more* screen time.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say this series is probably worth a watch if you&#039;re just looking for an easy vampire related anime fix, but after spending a good few hours ploughing through this series, I am left wondering if I want to bother at all with its counterpart; leaning heavily towards the &#039;No&#039; vote.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that I&#039;ve not read the manga, nor am I in the &#039;anime connoisseur&#039; league, but I am a writer (of sorts) and would know a good story when it hit me in the face: sadly, this failed to deliver such a pleasant blow.

    Vampire Knight is the 13-episode anime adaptation of the famous manga by renowned manga-ka Matsuri Hino. <br />
<br />
Revolving around a cast of teen-aged characters, or rather some teener-looking century-old vamps, the story unfolds with a female character named Yuki Cross, a renowned student who keeps one of the biggest secrets her school has to cautiously conceal, as the point-of-view. The typical shojo anime protagonist, she exhibits the traits (candy eyes, cheerful attitude, encouraging words, beautiful face, and most specifically attractiveness) many viewers would like her to. As the main of the main characters, she, of course, is most likely to have different interactions with the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5639">
        characters. Some of which are Zero Kiryuu and Kaname Kuran, of which both are considered in the anime as the &#039;guys&#039; girls often have in their little dreamland. Of all the other characters, these three make the story move on to a different chapter. Other characters play a not-so-catchy role as the mentioned three do, but practically their &#039;existence&#039; in the series would prove them essential to the story. Evolving in a slow phase, the characters-- of which most female viewers would note their totally &#039;hot&#039; appearance&amp;mdash; make up most of what the audiences really stick their ass to. Since the bishies in this anime are the ones made to stand out, most VK-tard viewers are females! But don&#039;t consider this show &amp;quot;gay!&amp;quot; It&#039;s good, I tell you (and no... I&#039;m not being bias)! All the characters, be male or female, are candy-eyed. The main characters themselves have, obviously, their own life stories. They evolve in the same phase as the story does, of course. In my case, I hate none of them. Given equivalent weights of parts in the story, such characters are highly guaranteed to please us the viewers; thus, I give them a commendable 8 ^_^<br />
<br />
The story, on the other hand, evolves in the same phase as the characters do: not rushed yet not slow. To put simply, the story it features has an assortment of drama, romance, and, noticeably, a bit of horror (quite a good &amp;quot;chemistry&amp;quot; if you ask me). The &amp;quot;horror&amp;quot; part is not highly emphasized, even though the title itself suggests it would offer a good hair-raising experience. What I call true horror would involve ugly demoniacs. On the contrary, there ain&amp;rsquo;t any fugly bad guys&amp;mdash;just them who have killer smiles! What I think is the main highlight is romance (I relate it with the &amp;quot;Knight&amp;quot; in Vampire Knight)! Consider a girl interacting between two dependent guys a romantic story featuring a tense love triangle. The genre drama is given the same importance as romance&amp;mdash; good romance must involve good drama! I take back what I said about it not plunging into a deep plot. I admit the story is nice! Following a stream of media res, there&#039;s quite a good number of flashbacks. The first episodes of the anime don&amp;rsquo;t really offer a good number of twists. It was only at the latter part that things turned out to be the unexpected. With these ingredients in the story, it deserves an 8 ^_^<br />
<br />
          I have not read a single page of the manga, but many say the art of the manga was a lot better than in the anime. Perhaps it is. I do think that the art and animation aren&#039;t exactly that good. There are quite some distortions in the face of the characters. Some viewers commented that the manga was just too &amp;lsquo;sketchy&amp;rsquo; for the art to be animated. Then again, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t at all that bad. I give the art and animation a 7.<br />
<br />
          <br />
<br />
          The music or sound, on the other hand, furthermore adds eeriness to the already-creepy theme, or whatever emotion the scenes require. The music presents a good vampire-ish theme. There is nothing more to say about the sound, so I give it a 9 ^_^<br />
<br />
          Vampire Knight is not exactly my type of anime, but it still gives me the urge to watch it&amp;hellip; and as they say, &amp;ldquo;let VK show you a sweet dream next time!&amp;rdquo;<br />

    (EDIT: 4\25\11: I used to love the manga of VK, but even though now I hate it, I hate the anime much more.)<br />
<br />
First of all, I&#039;m serious: I think the creators of the anime love Kaname more than Zero. It&#039;s quite obvious from the beginning that the love triangle is KanameYuukiZero, then why does Kaname present in YuukiZero scenes? In those scenes in the manga he wasn&#039;t even there at all O_o And there are more.<br />
<br />
The story of course is great, but the anime ruined it totally. Zero behaves like a wimp, he&#039;s not like himself, and Yuuki also. Since when Yuuki has been taking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5694">
        Zero&#039;s insults seriously? I won&#039;t tell spoilers but the anime exposes things very fast. Things that were clear at chapter 34 in the manga were hintend at episode 5 for example and in the opening and ending as well. The animation is so poor, and the art that is absolutely amazing in the manga is ruined in the anime. But I love the seyuus, they are awesome and as well the opening theme and the ending theme (not their clips, only the songs).<br />
<br />
I really hoped that the anime of my favorite manga would be awesome, but I guess I was mistaken. Did I have high expectations? I wonder...

    10 years ago, Cross Yuki was rescued from an attack by a rogue vampire that got her whole family killed by Kuran Kaname, a noble vampire. Now, under the watchful eye of Chairman Cross, Yuki&#039;s foster father, both are students at the Cross Acedemy, where there&#039;s a Day Class for humans, and Night Class for vampires. There, Yuki, along with Kiryuu Zero, a childhood friend with a deep hatred for vampires, they attempt to prevent the secret of the vampires&#039; identities from the student mass.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
I was sorely disappointed with the anime. Hino Matsuri&#039;s manga version had a great story going for it, only for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5944">
        anime version to warp it really badly. I give the writers credit for trying, but one shouldn&#039;t change the story so drastically it affects the flow the mangaka created. It isn&#039;t bad for those that haven&#039;t read the manga, but for those that have, I highly doubt you&#039;ll like it.<br />
<br />
ART<br />
Again, to be fair to the producers, the art ain&#039;t that bad, but comparing to the manga, Zero doesn&#039;t really have a dark, sad look that he does in the manga, and Yuki looks far too cute that she almost has a Kanon style look.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
I love the opening song. I really do. The sound thoughout the show really does give a good feeling too, and helps bring up the mood. But sound really doesn&#039;t help improve a storyline.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
Yuki is the best character in the anime version, and the only reason I gave this a 7, because I actually liked her with comedy, which she lacks in the manga. However, the rest of the characters are either the same, or thrown out of character. Aidou, for example, wasn&#039;t really explored deeply, and he just does things that weren&#039;t explained in the anime, but was in the manga.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
I wasn&#039;t bored out of my wits, but I wasn&#039;t exactly jumping with joy at every episode of new release like I would with some anime. I had hoped it would be as enchanting as the manga was, but by the end of episode 2, I found it lacking.<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
I cannot say it is a bad anime in anyway possible, nor is it a good one either. I expected better of the company that did legends like Higurashi no Naku Koroni and Rurouni Kenshin, and good anime like Kyo Kara Maou and Marimite, but this was just a disappointment. If you liked the anime, I recommend the manga. Art&#039;s better, character&#039;s better, story&#039;s better, and of course, enjoyment&#039;s better.

    I think this is an anime that can be appreciated by the manga readers, but never fully approved of by them.<br />
<br />
I fully enjoyed watching season 1, finding myself drawn in and addicted to the feeling and the sounds. I could not stop watching it. <br />
<br />
When the anime did vary from the manga, I found it to be an enriching manner that made the story a little bit easier to understand. There were a few points in the manga when everything wasn&#039;t very clear, and the anime did a very good job of clarifying everything. And again, the music was perfectly chosen, with a well-chosen catchy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6803">
        opening them and a chilling and haunting ending theme. <br />
<br />
However, there are definately significant weak spots to this anime. The art was okay at best, with a few even laughably horrible animation points, and one of the most important scenes in the manga was rushed through towards the end, completely ruining the effect the manga had given. <br />
<br />
As far as for the storyline of Vampire Knight in general, I have to give props to the writer for not trying to make obvious plot points some big surprise. When she knew the audience was going to find out something anyway, she embraced that fact and built upon it. <br />
<br />
I think this is something that should be watched and enjoyed for nothing else than the chilling sounds and high entertainment value. Just, if you&#039;ve read the manga, don&#039;t expect the same beautiful work in this anime.

    Vampires in anime is nothing original and definitely nothing ground-breaking, in 2006, the idea of vampires had taken a back seat, Twilight didn&#039;t exist so there was a lack of screaming fangirls talking about what team they were, in fact, before there was Twilight....There was Vampire Knight.<br />
Many people, including me tend to think &quot;oh, vampires, meh&quot; and it takes a quality show such as Production IG&#039;s &#039;Blood: The Last Vampire&#039; to turn heads and make people think otherwise, only to be kicked in the teeth by god awful vampire anime such as Fortune Arterial, Vampire Knight was a step in the right direction, but its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121567">
        far from perfect.<br />
<br />
We follow the story of Yuki Cross, who as a child, was attacked by a Vampire and saved by Kaname Kuran, a pureblood vampire (he&#039;s basically top of the vampire hierarchy).<br />
Time skip to high school because every anime seems to be set in bloody high school, she attends Cross Academy led by her father, Kaien who is determined to make Humans and Vampires live in harmony by having them attend the same school.<br />
The day class is for humans such as Yuki and her partner Zero as school guardian, and they are responsible for keeping the over-excited girls at bay when the night class strut their way into Cross Academy.<br />
The night class are (wait for it) THE VAMPIRES, and are, in my opinion the only set of characters that kept the entire series afloat during the more...dull time of the series. We have Kaname Kuran, Yuki&#039;s love interest and childhood hero and Aido Hanabusa, the comic relief antagonistic senior to Yuki who is presumably jealous of their relationship, the rest dont have much importance, but theyre all equally cool.<br />
<br />
Studio Deen took the reigns for this anime, well known for animating When They Cry (Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni) and, while they&#039;ve never been at the peak of animation quality, thankfully for this show it isnt utter shit either, the animation is mediocre at best and certain action scenes felt off to me, other than that, its bearable to watch, so, as of right now, Vampire Knight is a fairly solid anime.<br />
<br />
Now on to the good stuff, i&#039;ll quickly give my two cents on the opening and ending song before i get on to the &#039;dub or sub&#039; argument, the opening song took me around 9 episodes to get used to, and on occasion i actually skipped it as there is absolutely nothing noteworthy on it, the song actually starts before the characters in the preview of the episodes have finished speaking leading to a clusterf**k of different voices for a few seconds. The ending song titled &#039;Still Doll&#039; was more compelling, it didnt try to animate too much and it left a large sense of insecurity on me after it had finished, the voice of the singer Kanon Wakeshima was borderline perfect and the last few frames was very creepy.<br />
Dub or sub? Sub. I havent even watched it in japanese just yet, but the dub felt like it was just slapped on, the dialogue was poor for reasons i&#039;ll get onto in a moment, and i honestly think the dub is the primary reason i never enjoyed the show as much as i should have.<br />
Now its no spoiler to say that Zero&#039;s parents are dead as its explained pretty much right after he is introduced, their death is his motivation to keep fighting and the source of his hatred for vampires, Yuki is meant to be his bestfriend, just keep that in mind for the quote i&#039;m about to give you...<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;You think she&#039;s the vampire that brutally murdered your entire family?&quot;<br />
<br />
WTF? Yes, all the characters that mention Zero&#039;s parents to Zero himself seem to love reminding him of how the series&#039; antagonist butchered his parents, which made me feel that either the characters were trying to make Zero cry or that they needed to remind him for the sake of having something to say.<br />
The voice actors do an outright poor job of expressing the feelings between the characters that the japanese dub apparently has which causes the whole romance/tragedy side of the show to be completely laughable, i honestly watched death scenes of the characters multiple times thinking &quot;Wait, was i supposed to care?&quot;<br />
The dub has successfully made it onto a list of english dubs i flatout REFUSE to listen to ever again in my life, and i can count the amount of such dubs on one hand.<br />
<br />
The characters, to some extent make the rest of the show bearable, not a single character that matters in the story is a cliche stereotype of any anime archetype, and for that i can applaud the idea, however thanks to the dub, the characters came off as plain with no character growth whatsoever and when the story gets &#039;serious&#039; in the final 4 episodes, i felt myself struggling to even finish it, taking 30 minute breaks between episodes to cope with the inevitable cliffhanger ending.<br />
<br />
Oh, yes, normally i dont like talking about a show&#039;s ending to the point where i give it a whole section in the review, but in my belief the ending is what makes the show solid, and in this case...it wasnt, it ends on a god-awful cliffhanger which, if you were struggling to finish the first 13 episodes like i did, you are now forced to watch 13 MORE to get the full effect of the story, admittedly, however, the story is incredibly strong, making no room for your typical beach episodes or filler bullshit, everything is completely necessary and the plot twists are masterfully executed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This show is by no means for everyone, and if you want a vampire anime i would rather recommend Blood: The Last Vampire or Trinity Blood over this, but if you must, watch it, it ain&#039;t half bad, i have alot to say about it (mostly negative) but honestly i think its because i havent watched the japanese dub or even the second season, so my final opinions on the series as a whole is likely to change, but for now, the first season was a tad messy, leaving all of the explanations for the second season in typical Studio Deen fashion.<br />
<br />
I give this anime a 6/10 and the overall recommendation to stream it if you have absolutely nothing else to watch

    In summary, Vampire Knight is the anime offspring of Ouran High School Host Club meets Twilight. I didn&#039;t have high hopes for this anime and was pleasantly surprised at the strength of character development and some plot twists. <br />
<br />
Cross Academy is like 2 schools rolled into one. The normal day class students are all intrigued and have terrific crushes on members of the Night Class who look like Movie Stars. Of course they day class is completely unaware that the Night Class are vampires, and an uneasy peace is kept by 2 prefects (Yuki and Zero), obeying the Headmaster&#039;s ideals of &quot;let&#039;s all just get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15809">
        along&quot;.<br />
<br />
The night class looks like Ouran High School Host Club come to life. Every one of the men is handsome *sigh*, with the handsomest being Clan Kaname, the Pureblood Noble. He saved Yuki when she was a child, but Yuki&#039;s fellow prefect Zero hates him because he is a vampire.<br />
<br />
Therein is the crux of the love triangle! The plot twisted and turned enough to keep me interested. There was a lot of angst, staring and brooding. Parts of it were downright sexy. Even I who hate the sight of blood found myself intensely interested in some of the ... food scenes. <br />
<br />
Art was same as Ouran style, sound was just ok. Although the OP was very well done the rest of the soundtrack was very nondescript.<br />
<br />
The ending was a little unexpected (a cop out) or I would have scored it higher. However thanks to 1 scene of fanservice for females the overall score ended up as an 7. At the end of it, the series didn&#039;t feel complete hence the 7 overall score. Good premise, lots of promise, could have been better executed. At the very least though, it was good enough to make me want to watch the sequel (just to find out what happens).

    The setting for this anime is maybe not an original one, VampirexMortal. But little parts of the storyline had me intrigued, and on the advice of a friend, I sat down to watch it.<br />
<br />
As I said, little additions and quirks of the storyline (such as Yuuki being saved by a vampire as a young girl, Zero&#039;s *affliction* -I&#039;ll call it that so there are no spoilers- and vampires being a night class while mortals are a day class of a boarding school.) made me enjoy certain parts of this story.<br />
The first few episodes had me thoroughly enjoying it, the art a major bonus to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28937">
        story. Comedy I wasn&#039;t expecting filled the first few episodes, and the music had me humming along.<br />
<br />
Then, it all began to go downhill. Trying to suddenly adapt into a very dark, very sombre tale from what started out as maybe a black comedy had the whole story floundering. The story began to be brushed as what seemed to be filler episodes took up minute after minute. The true story and plot is only set into motion around episode 9. Leaving 4 episodes to give you a very unsatisfying and lukewarm ending.<br />
<br />
The characters are another part of this anime which annoy me. Kaname is the most pretentious (I&#039;m sorry to say), stuck up, arrogant and very, very cunning and sly. Not really the qualities you expect in a shoujo - do you? And while I&#039;ll admit it&#039;s refreshing, it&#039;s still not right.<br />
Yuuki is...utterly pathetic. One thing that puts me right off certain animes or mangas is weak female protagonists. And Yuuki is one of the worst. I&#039;d like to hope it&#039;s because the mangaka needed filler chapters. Yuuki, never learning from her mistakes, constantly walking into trouble and always ends up being rescued by either Zero or Kaname.<br />
This does nothing to prevent the whole show falling into a downward spiral as it tries to explain every filler episode with chilling precision. Fair enough, but why not just call it what it is - an episode in which the base plot does not progress, and a chance to see Yuuki saved by some hot guy?<br />
<br />
The comedy was this anime&#039;s saving grace-the only reason I rated this anime as high as I did, for me, as I went completely off this anime the minute Yuuki batted her eyelashes and was saved by Kaname. If you must watch this show - the side characters are actually the most interesting, and most comedic.

    Initially, I wanted to rate this review 9/10 overall because I&#039;m secretly (well, not so secret anymore) in love with one of the characters inside *fan girl moment* ZERO *blush* <br />
<br />
Zero is just too hot for an anime character, don&#039;t you think so? <br />
<br />
*End of fan girl moment* <br />
<br />
Back to the topic,<br />
<br />
Basically, this story is about vampires, vampires and vampires as you would predict from the title. Honestly, I didn&#039;t plan on even watching this anime even though I heard great reviews about it and all because of the word &quot;Vampire&quot;. Ever since Twilight came out, vampire books and movies have been a hit and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34885">
        I personally find it overrated so I didn&#039;t even bother to look up for reviews about it.<br />
<br />
Until...one day, I you-tube hopped and spotted Vampire Knight and read the comments...<br />
<br />
The one that attracted me the most -&gt; &quot;OMGGGGG the guys in vampire knight are soooooooooooooo hot&quot;<br />
<br />
Since it&#039;s hard for me to get obsessed over an anime character (Okay, to be honest, it&#039;s quite easy, they just have to look pretty and good looking and I&#039;m hooked but then, I&#039;m being quite biased ain&#039;t I?) I went onto review sites and look up for the characters and dayum! One of the main characters attracted me just like that so I decided to give this series a try.<br />
<br />
I will be honest though - if the first episode doesn&#039;t get me hooked onto it, I will by no means watch a second episode - unless, I&#039;m TOO bored.<br />
<br />
The first episode did get me hooked because it was so deep and thrilling in a fun way ;)<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
I thought that the story was really interesting and the plot gets deeper as you dived more into the series. No filler episodes and that makes me really happy as they concentrated on the story more.<br />
<br />
You should wiki the story to know more about the Purebloods and the vampire families - that is really interesting. I find it really fascinating that Purebloods have so much power compared to the normal vampires and Level E and so on...<br />
<br />
I was really afraid the story is gonna be 24/7 scary and vampire-y (as in biting and licking and stuff) but thank goodness, there were funny moments and chibi-fied faces as well. I&#039;m surprised Kaname didn&#039;t have a chibi-face of himself!<br />
<br />
I guess he&#039;s too cool for it B)<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
Nothing much to rave about but it&#039;s pleasant to my eyes. At first, I get so annoyed with the female protagonist because her eyes are SO huge that it&#039;s crazy! I mean, I know that anime girls usually have huge eyes but her eyes are so huge that they look like they&#039;re gonna suck me in anytime - seriously.<br />
<br />
The male leads are of course - stunning and very, very hot. I have no objections of the character&#039;s art except for Yuuki&#039;s eyes. Other than that, the other characters looked pleasantly beautiful.<br />
<br />
The background was decent - I mostly see trees and lots of trees but they suit the mood just right because half of the series, the background plays quite a role because they were very dark and moody just like the series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
OP and ED songs were alright although I find the ED song REEEEALLY creepy that I usually skip it most of the time. I get scared easily and hey, red eyes and broken mirrors? Nuh-uh. I&#039;m out.<br />
<br />
But what really impressed me was the voices of the characters. It suited them just right! I love Zero&#039;s tortured voice (heheh it&#039;s sexy) and Kaname&#039;s &quot;serious and mysterious&quot; voice as well. I particularly liked the Chairman&#039;s voice as well. He can sound so serious at times...and then......HAPPY at other times.<br />
<br />
Epic.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
Character character character. I really love the characters in these series. Sure, they are all the same - love triangle, beautiful people T_T and all but what I&#039;m talking about is the character itself - the personality.<br />
<br />
I personally find Yuuki&#039;s character very weak and a little bit annoying because she doesn&#039;t do anything much and doesn&#039;t help much either other than giving her blood for Zero to drink. One good point about her: She&#039;s cute? And she&#039;s very optimistic. <br />
<br />
Kaname&#039;s character is very, very interesting. You never know what he&#039;s up to...and you wonder - is he a good guy or a bad guy? It&#039;s like he&#039;s never both of them or he could be both of them...<br />
<br />
He just leaves you confused.<br />
<br />
Zero&#039;s character - dude, could you blame him if he wants to kill himself? I&#039;m sick of people saying Zero&#039;s character is so weak and lame and all but can you actually imagine yourself in Zero&#039;s situation? Both parents killed by a vampire and yet, he turns into a vampire himself and is unable to control his thirst? Tell me, if you&#039;re like that - will you still find yourself weak? <br />
<br />
The supporting characters are really interesting as well. I loved it when slowly by slowly, their pasts are being depict to the viewers and it leaves us wanting more!<br />
<br />
Aidou is one of the supporting characters that impressed me. He can be so friendly and flirty yet...mean. Watch it to know what I mean :P<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
Some scenes were a bit draggy but they&#039;re not as draggy as Vampire Knight Guilty&#039;s, personally I find VKG verrrrrry slow but I shall save this review for later. <br />
<br />
Each episode leaves you a cliffhanger and makes you crave for more! An episode without a cliffhanger basically tells you - &quot;*Yawn* I shall watch this some other day...&quot; <br />
<br />
I know the director was trying to picture Yuuki&#039;s thoughts but they were really too much that I can predict what she&#039;s gonna say even before she goes into her &quot;I&#039;m scared of Vampires&quot; mood...it&#039;s always...the same.<br />
<br />
But all I can say is, it&#039;s interesting yet at times, it can be draggy and annoying. The plot is what keeps me glued onto the laptop screen. Episode by episode, they slowly tells us about the relationship between the vampires and the vampire hunters and of course, Yuuki&#039;s past..<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
The 8 is for the lovely characters and the really interesting story and of course the enjoyment. The -2 - some scenes were draggy and put on repeat but other than that, you&#039;re gonna enjoy this movie if you&#039;re up for a little romance and mystery. <br />
<br />
<br />

    I never finished this anime and never will,except if I&#039;m totally bored.It doesn&#039;t worth watching.Read the manga.If you haven&#039;t before watching I doubt you&#039;ll find anything wrong with the anime.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
It lacks,lacks and doesn&#039;t follow the main story sometimes.I also noticed some filler events,some of which were nice additions I must say and some weren&#039;t.Hm...the thing is I also noticed that some things that happened in the manga,like dialogues,were cutt off and replaced by those so called &quot;filler&quot; dialogues or whatever.Well,I know this is just a 13 anime episode but why change it when you could have simply left it as it was  instead

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16647">
        of altering certain things.Obviously it wasn&#039;t much of a story in the anime.I also found myself confused at times because it really made me feel like,did this really happen in the manga?<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
I don&#039;t have anything against it I think so far,but it cannot compare to that of the manga.It&#039;s really nice,impressive and all but I felt that their faces looked lifeless.I love the eyes in the manga and the anime couldn&#039;t bring that out.I can forgive that though.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
Enjoyed both OP and ED.To think that I wouldn&#039;t skip them,who me...The thing is that that is the only thing I remember when it comes to sound and nothing more from during the anime.Okay,maybe the characteristic vampire-music but it could have been better.I was pleased by the seiyus,especially Mamoru Miyano as Zero.They fit their characters.<br />
<br />
Character 5/10<br />
Didn&#039;t feel connected,didn&#039;t feel like the manga.They attempted though,but all this blah-blah was tiring.I think they were trying to make Yuuki likeable,but I actually hated her after watching the anime.Seriously,she looks way too immature for me and never learns.I think the characters became a little repetetive after a while,like Aidou.Most actually lacked screentime so this is making me think that they wanted to focus on the love-triangle the most.Bad bad bad.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10<br />
I could hardly pull myself to like it,no wonder I dropped it.I was expecting a lot more and got disappointed.I&#039;ll admit it that I did enjoy the first 3-4 episodes.At least they could have put some more impressive battles.<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10<br />
For those who have read the manga if you haven&#039;t then go ahead,maybe you&#039;ll like it.Or you could simply read the manga.I can&#039;t possibly believe how this could turn out like this.13 episodes is not enough for all this manga,people should understand that but nooo...They&#039;re just trying to &quot;please&quot; the fans(mostly the opposite).It would have been better if it were to come out one episode every month BUT following the actual story.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading and let me know your thoughts.

    Vampire knight was a welcome change for me in terms of the darker tone of the show, compared to the usual reverse harem, soujo anime. I loved the fact it was not the typical sweet and innocent cliche anime, it had at least a little more depth to it. <br />
<br />
I say a &#039;little&#039; because to be honest it still is far from being a well, rounded, engaging, action packed and thought-provoking anime. It still is very much targeted at teenage girls with a thirst for &#039;twilighty&#039; things.. <br />
<br />
The story was not a bad one, compared with many other animes of a similar genre, as there

        was the element of horror and mystery. The characters were fairly interesting. Kaname was my favorite, and Zero being a troubled soul also had his quirks and complexities. Sad to say our protagonist was rather weak and oh-so-obliging. I would be the first to say I hate an overly loud, domineering and arrogant protagonist, but seriously, Yuuki takes the feminist cause back about a decade. <br />
<br />
If you have been watching Earl and the Fairy, Hakuōki, Special A etc, I think you would enjoy a similar feel but change of scenery. Other than that i believe you would find Vampire Knight rather average and perhaps best to be avoided..<br />

    Most love the manga and not the anime and I totally concur! I noticed some of the movement/fight sequences are really choppy, like they&#039;re missing frames or something.  Has anyone else noticed that Zero appears to be moon-walking? Ugh. If you&#039;re curious, check it out but honestly, I&#039;m done watching the first season and don&#039;t intend to watch the 2nd season. I&#039;ll be focusing on the manga only.

      First of all, I hate it when people say &#039;the only people that can like this anime are 14 year old girls&#039;. I&#039;m 18 years old and I loved this anime.<br />
<br />
  I&#039;m very into romance with animes, and I always HAVE to have at least one or two kisses. Although Vampire Knight didn&#039;t really have one, I still loved it. It provided the right amount of romance, even if there wasn&#039;t much kissing.<br />
I like how it has different elements to it, there&#039;s some thriller scenes, romance, comedy and some action. I would have liked more action, but apart from that it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39222">
        perfect for me.<br />
<br />
  The negatives? Like I said, lack of action, apart from that I can&#039;t really think of much else.<br />
<br />
  The soundtrack was great, it made my heart pound and I loved that. I was constantly singing the theme music for weeks after watching.<br />
<br />
  The art was better then average I&#039;d say, sometimes Kaname could end up looking a bit odd, but apart from that it was nicely done.<br />
<br />
  I gave it a 9, but it would have definitely gotten a 10 if there was more fighting.<br />
<br />
  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did :)

    Vampire Knight oh Vampire Knight! One of those blood-sucking enjoy-a-ble type of anime/manga it&#039;s suppose to be, huh?! Well.. Not exactly.<br />
<br />
ART: Ah, the art.. The art is quite decent. Its actually pretty well done. The eyes are quite big though, especially on Yuuki. The face expressions when somebody&#039;s getting bitten by a vamp was pretty cool as well. reading ze&#039; manga and watching ze&#039; anime, I have noticed that the characters have LONG necks! Its a bit too long! =3=<br />
<br />
STORY: Its not the best, sadly.VK has its ups and downs during the story. And, I was expecting lots of action because they put vamps with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23144">
        humans together so, I wanna see some blood on da&#039; floor. PS: I think in some parts of VK, Matsuri Hino trys to put in some funny parts but.. It doesnt seem to work..<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: I hate it when vamps are suppose to act &quot;distant&quot; or &quot;cool&quot;. It makes me..furious! Seriously, Im getting tired of that.. The only person I seem to aprove of would be Ichijou Takuma. But, he&#039;s not exactly the best.. I LOVE THE HEADMASTER! He&#039;s hyper, giddy..and etc! He&#039;s the best, he PWNS. Kaname protects a bit tooooooooo much.. Zero acts like he&#039;s PMS-ing. Yuuki is just.. eh. Aidou is too vain within himself.. I can go alll day.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: By reading this review, you can tell that Im VERY disapointed. Matsuri Hino&#039;s MeruPeri (something like that) is a bit more enjoy-a-ble.
