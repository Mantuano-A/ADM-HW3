    I absolutely loved this anime, and everything about it, I can&#039;t help but give everything a 10, for some though, if I could, I&#039;d give more than a 10, as I&#039;ll have in my reasons below<br />
<br />
This review is being given after watching the Japanese version of this anime<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
You could say that this anime starts out a little slow, with the meeting of the main character, Masaru, and Agumon (once more the main characters digimon) and the introduction of all the other characters that will later play a big part in the series. I had this anime on-hold at episode 14, and when I started

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5171">
        it back up again, I became completely addicted to the series. Though I remember the beginning being slow (which is why I put it on-hold for such a long time), once I began watching it again I couldn&#039;t stop. I non-stopped watched the series and it&#039;s action-packed plot. <br />
The whole storyline mainly focuses on the &#039;main&#039; main character, Masaru Daimon and his digimon with some of the side main character, Yoshino Fujieda and her digimon, Raramon, Touma Norstein and his digimon, Gaomon, as well as the later introduced character, Ikuto Noguchi and his digimon, Falcomon, as they all aim to help protect the Human World as well as the Digital World from both attacks from Digimon, and even other humans.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Unlike the other Digimon series, Digimon Savers (or Data Squad as it is known in English) doesn&#039;t focus on young kids getting Digimon, this time it&#039;s older teens who get/have Digimon. The age of Masaru, Yoshino, and Touma would average around 17 years of age, with Ikuto being the youngest main character at the age of 10. With teens getting Digimon this time around, the art is a bit different in terms of the art of each of the human characters. <br />
And yet again, the art for every time the Digimon evolve is excellent as it takes on a totally different form from the normal images that are seen during the viewing of each episode.<br />
<br />
Sound: 11/10<br />
This is one of the ones that I couldn&#039;t help but give it a higher rating than what&#039;s aloud here. I found myself absolutely addicted to the both of the opening and ending theme songs as well as some of the music that was played during the episodes. Sometimes I would even dance to the music while it was playing on the episode. Which was hard when I was trying to read the subs on my iPod ^^;<br />
Anyway, the music was absolutely amazing and all the voices for the characters fit them perfectly, I have no complaints at all.<br />
<br />
Characters: 11/10<br />
The personalities of each character were well planned (in my opinion) and there were no &#039;split-personality&#039; characters in this anime. <br />
Each character was unique and had pasts that would later on become a large part of the series. (at least most of them)<br />
By the end of the series, I had become extremely attached to almost each and every character, especially Ikuto, Falcomon, and Masaru, and was crying at the end because of the fact that the series was ending and it would be the last time I&#039;d get to see them unless I rewatched it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 11/10<br />
I couldn&#039;t say I have enjoyed a series THIS much in a long time!! Being a fan of not only Digimon, but action-packed, adventure, and comedy animes, I loved this series!! It has a nice balance of action, adventure, as well as even it&#039;s bit of comedy that almost every anime needs to succeed!<br />
<br />
Overall: 50/50<br />
If I kept the normal ratings of 10 for each, I&#039;d end up with a 50 out of 50 score for overall. The anime was great, the characters couldn&#039;t be better, the music is absolutely addicting. I couldn&#039;t ask for anything better than what this anime managed to pack into its 48 episodes.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for an action-packed, adventure, comedy, and something that you&#039;ll enjoy even if you&#039;ve never watched a Digimon episode before, I know you&#039;ll want to watch this series!! Go on! Try it out, you won&#039;t be regretting it.

    You may like or dislike this series, but there&#039;s an undeniable fact: Digimon Savers actually saved the Digimon anime franchise, that&#039;s why we got the sixth series, Xross Wars. People who dislike (or even hate the series) are usually 2 types of people: 1) people who saw barely 3 or 4 episodes and abandoned it and 2) people who watched it from the beginning to finish annoyed by the fact that this series is way too different from the previous Digimon series. The first I can understand, as Savers doesn&#039;t have the strongest first arc (like every Digimon series), but the second one I don&#039;t:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100785">
        every single Digimon series is different and distinctive from each other, so what if this one is more mature and darker? I think that is one of the strengths of this series, because it aimed to those children who grew up watching Digimon, offering them something they can almost equally enjoy, with new layers of depth, great character insight, darkness of despair and the always reliable power of believing in your dreams: now that is a Digimon series! That is what made Adventure so rich, and amazingly executed, even when it was a bit lighter. I respect the people who say that they don&#039;t like this series, because I accept we may not share the same taste, however if you look at the execution, everything here works in every level, and we&#039;ll see why now:<br />
<br />
Story wise: Savers have 4 distinct story arcs. The first one relays too much on the comedy side, but the following 3 goes deeper into the drama side (while never fully abandoning its comedy roots) and delivers some really deep emotional moments along with satisfying story arcs and some tearjerkers moments.<br />
First arc, DATS: From episode 1 to 11 we have an episodic format, a case of the week if you may, in which our DATS member have to face Digimon cases and handle them &quot;quietly&quot;. Here we are introduced to our main trio, Masaru, Yoshino and Tohma, and their digimon. These 11 episodes are way too light on the drama and character background side, only foreshadowing for later, while being too heavy on the comedy; every Digimon series starts slow, so I guess the choice to rely on comedy was made in order to make it more passable, however it is because of this that the first inserts of drama feels out of place, but everything changes in episode 12 and then onwards we have an outstanding shounen anime.<br />
Second arc, Mercurimon and the inter-dimensional conflict: here is where Savers passes from enjoyable time killer to be actually good to great. We get insight in our characters, the story plot thickens, and we feel like we finally are being told a true conceived and thought through story rather than just random cases. The drama side starts taking over the comedy and I must say, it is good drama, as it develops from what was foreshadow earlier and both story arcs and characters arc start to go along.<br />
Third arc, Kurata and the genocide: Here Savers just shows its teeth and becomes great; if by the second arc we peaked at characters depth now we sink into their darkness, we get to see the best and the worst of our heroes, and they start to truly grow and mature by the experiences of the previous arc; we get to see them being reckless, feeling jealousy, betraying, losing faith, but we also get to see them standing right back up, facing their own flaws, and take a step forward against a seemingly hopeless situation, despite their fears, and as the character work is just right, it is incredibly satisfying.<br />
Fourth and final arc, Yggdrasil and the crisis: Now, if we already saw darkness in the previous arc then prepare yourselves to go even deeper. Here we are in one of the worst crisis any Digimon series has faced since Tamers; if the previous crisis was seemingly hopeless, this one is even more. Our characters have already grown, they know they have to stand still, yet the doubt is there and as they work out their own issues they find the strength to move forward, and I must say that these episodes are the most moving of the series, and successfully made me cry in various episodes; I know that&#039;s just me, but I have to say it, because it aims for a great emotional impact and delivers.<br />
<br />
Characters: Digimon Savers has great story plot and pacing, but lacks on the beginning. However, it does have something that it is almost flawless: character work.<br />
Masaru: In the beginning he is the typical shounen hero, strong headed, stubborn, bad attitude and borderline stupid. His best quality in the beginning is that he is mostly funny to watch and be with, so I can understand some people not liking him. But don&#039;t be rash! Even the most stereotypical characters can work with the right character treatment and Masaru is proof of that. As the series goes forward he keeps his bad attitude and he always pick fights, but he grows more considerate, we are shown a background that makes sense with his personality, and successfully goes from annoying to really likeable. He feels like a different person and at the same time he&#039;s still Masaru. That is the best character treatment we can ask.<br />
Tohma: Just like Masaru, Tohma is also stereotypical, but get the best character treatment. Of all the characters he must have the hardest background and it totally echoes with his reserved and a bit arrogant personality. He grows deeper as the show goes forward and episode surrounding him are usually the strongest. He so clearly goes from the “know it all”, arrogant, calculator guy to a reliable friend who learns to trust his friends more than his wits, once again, without ever abandoning his true self. His growth is always in place, his actions are never out of character, and he faces troubles in unexpected, yet satisfying ways. I&#039;ll admit it, I have a soft spot for the character, but I think everyone could see all this in him.<br />
Yoshino: when your weakest character is still well developed you know you are looking at good material. Yoshino is the lazy yet responsible girl who- in the beginning- have some kind of inferiority complex, which she resolves as the series goes on and becomes an important asset to the team as well as a strong and determined person. The only thing I truly dislike about her is her background; it&#039;s not bad, but it&#039;s not fully exploited, and as such I would have liked to know a lot more about her family, but this is just a little complaint to an otherwise very well done character work.<br />
Ikuto: if there is a character that can compete with Tohma for saddest background it&#039;s him. He is a boy raised by Digimon, and as such he is mostly conflicted about his duality as human/digimon, and the series explores this issue with no fear and he grows around it. He goes all the way from wild reckless boy to what we could say is a very mature grown man. His character work is just outstanding, as it doesn&#039;t matter how many episodes pass by we see that he is always dealing with his duality as human/digimon, even when he seems to have accepted it, and that&#039;s just gold.<br />
The 4 main digimon: though the series is called &quot;Digimon&quot; the series focus way more in the human characters and their relation with their digimons. The digimons themselves are all fleshed out with their own quirks and personalities and show growth over the series, but it&#039;s mostly shadowed by the amazing character work of the human characters, but you can&#039;t stop noticing how much Agumon changed from the first arc to the last, and the same can be said about Gaomon, Lalamon and Falcomon; I won&#039;t go into details, but they all grow.<br />
Supporting: There are several! And all of them get their screentime and their due development in their limited time. Sayuri might be the weakest link, but she still has her moments as she shows how mothers have to struggle about seeing how their children might get hurt, but acknowledging that they must get hurt in order to grow, and as such she doesn&#039;t bother much. The rest of the supporting characters all have their own functions in different themes, and they show develop through the series.<br />
<br />
Sound: After feeling that Digimon Frontier lacked a little bit, I was glad to see that Savers came back with great tracks. &quot;Believer&quot; is a perfect evolution song as it fits every single character and &quot;Hiari&quot;, the second opening, just shows us how this show came from its comedy roots embracing the darkest side of itself while never abandoning important themes as dreams and hopes. The tracks were masterfully chosen and scored.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The first time I watched Savers I was 17 and I loved it, as I was thrilled to see a Digimon series that dared to be as mature as it could be, to tell us a story about teens and their conflicts, and to see them overcoming such incredibly, almost hopeless, situations. I watched again at 19 and I was still as pleased as the first time. Now I&#039;m 21, this is my third time, and I still enjoyed as much as the first time; even if you know our heroes will make it to the end, you can get so much joy out of their journey and their growth that I think I can watch it several times and never be bored.<br />
<br />
As I said before, I respect people who disliked Savers, but I don&#039;t understand them. I&#039;ve read some of the reviewers who hated the series and they say &quot;this is not the Digimon I grew up with!&quot;, now are they talking of Adventure, Tamers or Frontier? They are all different, and what is important is not to be similar, but to manage to exploit the storytelling and character potential that each series has: Tamers is way different from Adventure and still it triumphed because it denied its past and just wanted to create its own storytelling with the digimon elements. Savers does the same, and even surpasses Tamers (and almost reaches Adventure greatness) as it tell us a meaningful story that only lacks a bit on the first arc (with only 3 bad episodes) and delivers satisfying conclusions to each arc.<br />
I&#039;ll respect your opinions, and so I expect you to respect mine: for me Savers is the 2nd best Digimon series ever made, just slightly edged out by Adventure.<br />
<br />
Stray observations (funny bits of information I got while re-watching. May contain some spoilers):<br />
-In episode 5 we see Tohma bleeding; I think this is the first time ever a human has bled in a Digimon series.<br />
-These are the makeup exams Masaru took on episode 7: &quot;Modern Japanese Language&quot;, &quot;English&quot;, &quot;Japanese history&quot;, &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;Mathematics&quot;, and of course he didn&#039;t know anything about any of those subjects xD<br />
-Apparently Masaru likes to play the drum in Rock Band as seen in episode 7.<br />
-Every time a family matter is discussed Masaru grabbed his pendant, thinking about his father, which was a very good detail.<br />
-Banchouleomon laugh in episode 28 is epic!<br />
-Yoshino is so lazy that even in the short training sequence in episode 29 she didn&#039;t do anything xD.<br />
-Episode 31, Gaomon reaction to Masaru taking credit for Tohma&#039;s plan: &quot;It was master&#039;s plan&quot; I also got angry at Masaru back then too.<br />
-One great Yoshino moment: when she strikes a barrel at a Gizomon she finally shows some backbone!<br />
-The Masaru vs Tohma thing in episode 34 felt very much like Taichi vs Yamato from Adventure, it gave me goosebumps!<br />
-Masaru to Tohma in episode 35: &quot;Apologize to them with tour life! DIE!&quot; Now, that&#039;s the darkest side of Masaru. I applaud the writers for going there.<br />
-Gaomon in the finale, bringing tea to Tohma: &quot;It&#039;s my own blend. I call it &#039;my vow to meet you again&#039;&quot; that was so utterly cute that it got me to tears. I want a digimon like Gaomon!<br />
-At last, I&#039;d like to mention that, in my opinion, the finale is as perfect as Adventure&#039;s and Tamer&#039;s finales and left me with a wide open smile in my face. I didn’t want it to end!<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s it. As always, I hope you enjoyed this review. I&#039;ll make an effort and get through Digimon Xross Wars (the only Digimon series I dislike) and make a review, so… this might be the headline:<br />
Next time: Digimon Xross Wars tries to be every single Digimon series and manages to be none.

    I remember when I was about eight or nine this used to be on Kix, and I absolutely loved it. And five or six years later, I look online to see the horrible reviews it&#039;s getting.<br />
<br />
To be fair, I never watched the original Digimon, so I can&#039;t really say anything. But I do know that this show doesn&#039;t deserve all the criticism it gets. <br />
<br />
From what I know, it&#039;s DRASTICALLY different from the previous Digimon series. Different art style, older-looking characters, and a completely different concept. From what I understand, the previous Digimon series were about children being sent to the digital world, and Savers/Data

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217770">
        Squad is about a group of people who capture Digimon who are sent to the human world. Honestly, I see why fans of the original might not like this one at first glance. But if you get past the first few episodes (which in all honesty, are a little cheesy), I&#039;d say you&#039;d enjoy it. The series gets a little darker, and a lot more serious.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a die-hard Digimon fan, maybe sit this one out. If you&#039;re new to the series, I&#039;d say you&#039;d enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this a well-deserved 8/10

    After watching this series my second time I feel I need to write a short review about this season of Digimon. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
The soundtrack here is outstanding (if you ignore the opening and ending themes). Lots of stand out songs which have been burned into my memories, plenty to choose, all of which I enjoy. <br />
<br />
Art: <br />
I felt I needed to mention this since it is one of the weak parts of the show. I feel some of the attacks and actions could have looked even more epic, but a lot of it was either speeded up or just not given a finishing touch. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121683">
        also noticed the eyes would randomly teleport before the head would move into the correct position. Despite the lazy art design I thoroughly enjoyed this show. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
The story itself I feel is quite strong, I love that this anime pulled in a couple of digimon factions that we had never seen together before. However I couldn&#039;t help but notice the inconsistencies which occur in the show. One second a mega level is destroyed by an overwhelming attack, but next episode the same attack doesn&#039;t destroy champion or ultimate level digimon. This inconsistency occurs throughout the show to the point that I was questioning what the writers were thinking. Literally on the final boss, its attack defeats multiple mega level digimon, but then its attacks are stopped by mere champion levels. <br />
<br />
Overall I love Digimon and I feel this show saved itself from the disappointments of Frontier. One of my favourites of all seasons of digimon. <br />
<br />
Final score: 7/10

    Digimon Savers - the newest installment of the Digimon franchise. After a few years without Digimon, I was a little skeptical as to what this season would be like.<br />
<br />
For starters, I wouldn&#039;t recommend watching this if you are unfamiliar with past seasons of Digimon. They fail to explain basic facts that would leave newcomers perplexed. <br />
<br />
Character - Like all Digimon seasons, we have our main team of protagonists who set out to defeat the evil Digimon and save their own world as well as the Digital World. This time we get a cocky leader, Marcus, the more-mature and smart guy, Thomas, and the older female

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7940">
        lead, Yoshino. Yes, I watched the dub, so I&#039;m unfamiliar with their original names. The character&#039;s can become rather annoying to watch, especially their useless arguments every other episode. It just gets old...fast. Not my favorite batch of DigiDestined...that&#039;s for sure.<br />
<br />
Story - Digimon Savers started out in the worst possible way. They spend over 10 episodes on the same concept: an evil Digimon appears in the human world and our protagonists fend them off while growing in power and battle experience. I understand that they wanted to show off their Digimon&#039;s forms, but we don&#039;t need to see the same thing numerous times that has almost nothing to do with a plot of some sort. It was extremely boring. When the real story finally starts, it can be a little confusing. Like all seasons, we get our first bad guy &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; and then we get the true enemy. I suppose towards the end that the story gets more shocking, but it isn&#039;t anything special. <br />
<br />
Art &amp;amp; Sound - The art is alright. I actually preferred the style used in previous seasons, but it isn&#039;t anything to complain about. The sound can get annoying, though. <br />
<br />
But anyway, Digimon Savers is probably the season that you would either love or hate. I, personally, hated it, but that&#039;s just me.

    This is my first time writing a review for MAL, and I actually wasn&#039;t going to write any, but after finishing watching this series, I definitely cannot resist the urge. <br />
<br />
I scored this series 5, average. I would have given it a 4, but there are some things I actually somewhat enjoyed about Digimon Savers, so I thought calling it downright &quot;bad&quot; would be inappropriate. So instead I&#039;m going to say: this series is not good. It&#039;s not the worst ever, but it&#039;s not good. This comes from a person who has loved the Digimon merchandise as a whole for almost ten years.<br />
<br />
When Savers originally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35063">
        aired, I simply ignored it. I wasn&#039;t that high on Digimon hype back then and from the very first promo picture I could tell I didn&#039;t like the series. Only this year I finally decided to check it out, as I&#039;ve seen all the other seasons. <br />
It took me over a month to finish it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: The plot is fairly unoriginal. The digital world and the human world are beginning to overlap, main characters fight against invading digimon with their partners, a couple of sub plots emerge, and in the end they save both worlds by defeating a strong enemy. <br />
<br />
There are only two things that really distinguish this season from the others: firstly the way the main characrers have been made young adults instead of kids, and the DATS organisation. The former is a nice idea but poorly executed, and the latter somewhat reminds me of Tamers and isn&#039;t that original afterall. Most of the time I really couldn&#039;t bring myself to care about what was going on. The most interesting part of the story, for me anyway, was the concept of a team of researchers venturing to the digital world ten years before the main characters met their partners, and the fate of Daimon Suguru. Otherwise the overall plot took off clumsily and didn&#039;t reach any kind of peak of excitement. There wasn&#039;t a single episode that honestly would have left me feeling like I wanted to know what happens next.<br />
Overall, I think the story could have been better if it was carried out better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: Definitely the biggest setback of the whole series. It looks awful. The number of well-drawn episodes can be counted with the fingers of one hand, and that isn&#039;t much of help anyway as the colour scheme is one of the worst I have ever seen (and I have seen a good bunch of different kinds of anime, honestly). Just look at the shades of Masaru&#039;s hair and red outfit - they are unbelievably ugly. Overall the colours look dirty and grey-ish. <br />
<br />
And as I mentioned already, this series has very poor art, even on a kids&#039; show&#039;s standards. All the other Digimon seasons are better drawn, possibly thanks to their simple style. I cannot understand why they had to change the style so drastically to the worse. Savers is a gold mine of incorrect anatomy, awkward angles and bad perspective, not to mention their faces which were beautifully drawn only on very rare occasions. I swear Chika&#039;s face is drawn well only once in the whole series, and that is in the very last episode.<br />
<br />
The character designs do not appeal to me, at all. They lack imagination, the colours are mostly an eyesore, and their clothes are often ridiculous (for example the skin-tight DATS jumpsuits). Ikuto doesn&#039;t even look like a Digimon character. The way they changed Agumon to look much more artless is definitely a sign of plain laziness. And the list of weak points goes on and on. The animation is also mostly very poorly done and it often ended up making me laugh at its primality.<br />
<br />
Altogether, art-wise this series is a reminiscent of the ugly style of the beginning of the 00s when digital animation was still a new thing and animators weren&#039;t skilled enough yet. Considering that Digimon Savers came out in 2006 (and the older seasons look much, much better), this is rather outrageous. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds: The soundtrack had some good, memorable tunes, but mostly I didn&#039;t even think about the music all that much. I didn&#039;t like any of the opening &amp; ending songs either but this, I can say, is probably due to my personal pickiness when it comes to music, so the songs aren&#039;t necessarily bad. The evolution theme, Believer, is quite likeable, though not one of my favourite insert songs from Digimon.<br />
<br />
Not many people have commented on the seiyuu/voice actors of the series. This is yet another issue regarding Digimon Savers. While I adore some of his roles, Hoshi Souichirou manages to sound extremely annoying as Masaru most of the time, as shouting and screaming isn&#039;t one of his fortes. In almost every episode, he is doing some very over-the-top over-acting.<br />
Much worse than Hoshi is Yoshino&#039;s VA who simply cannot act at all. She sounds emotionless, forced and just plain stupid. I cannot comprehend why they couldn&#039;t give Yoshino a proper seiyuu, as the previous seasons showed some great talents and very famous actors.<br />
Another very poor attempt at acting was provided by the seiyuu of the blond-haired DATS woman, whose name I have entirely forgotten. She is a minor character, but I felt like ripping my head off every time she opened her mouth.<br />
I have no further complaints about the cast, though. Especially Nojima Hirofumi and Nakai Kazuya sound wonderful as Touma and Gaomon - Nakai has never sounded this cute before!<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: This section is mostly made of my personal opinions instead of facts, please don&#039;t forget that.<br />
<br />
Stereotypical and un-inspiring or simply annoying, the characters of Digimon Savers did not impress me. Masaru is your typical aggressive main character dressed in red, and it made me very sad how they didn&#039;t even care to give him goggles like every other main boy. Agumon lacks all of the charm his predecessor in Adventure had and is mostly tiresome for me to watch. <br />
<br />
Yoshino has very little to none personality with her Lalamon and I found it difficult to think anything at all about her (apart from her horrible VA). I guess she&#039;s supposed to be level-leaded yet insecure but I&#039;m not even sure. She was given very little highlight throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Touma and Gaomon, on the other hand, while not all that original either, are lovely characters and pretty much the only reason I bothered to complete this series. Touma, unlike the other characters, has multiple levels to his personality and is surprisingly refreshing even for a rival character in Digimon - I have to say he&#039;s like an older, half-European version of Jenrya (who happens to be my favourite from Tamers) but possibly even more charming. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the ones where the focus was on Touma&#039;s independent whereabouts. I guess you can call me biased like that.<br />
<br />
Ikuto, while his story was unique considering the whole Digimon verse, annoyed me right from the moment he was introduced. I tried very hard to like him but ended up disliking him more and more by every episode. His design is overdone and I can&#039;t stand bratty brats like him, no matter how justified his personality is by his past. Everything about him as a Digimon character is just way off.<br />
<br />
Masaru&#039;s family, sans his father, didn&#039;t manage to bring any emotion out of me. I liked his father and BanchouLeomon though, their story was interesting and delightful considering how he&#039;s the first seriously meaningful parent character ever in Digimon (well, maybe along with Jenrya&#039;s father). Overall I preferred Touma&#039;s family&#039;s bittersweet dynamics.<br />
<br />
The two DATS women were unnecessary and pointless, and I didn&#039;t care much about the villains either and didn&#039;t really understand all of their motives. In my eyes they were pretty much recycled material from other seasons and didn&#039;t bring anything new and exciting with them. <br />
<br />
The other minor characters, such as Satsuma, were nice - and weirdly seemed to have much more personality than Yoshino who&#039;s supposed to be the main girl...<br />
<br />
Overall, I couldn&#039;t get myself to sympathise much with the cast and found myself constantly annoyed at them - for example, the sub story with Chika and Piyomon was just plain boring in my opinion. The characters and their relationships lack charm and excitement and had very little to offer for someone who&#039;s seen all the seasons. I was hoping for the main characters to build interesting relationships with each other and it never happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Digimon Savers does have its occasional saving graces (namely Touma, Gaomon and Suguru), but overall it is a weak anime with poor production values and doesn&#039;t have any nostalgic value for an old Digimon fan. It didn&#039;t make me laugh with its lazy humour, and neither did it make me cry (seasons 1-4 did, quite easily actually). It&#039;s like a poor attempt to create a season where the fans can relate to the grown-up &quot;digidestined&quot;. I guess I did enjoy it enough to watch all 48 episodes, but on the other hand, at times I just stopped watching for a week. <br />
<br />
Overall, if the art and animation in Savers were better (say, similiar to the other series), I might have enjoyed it somewhat more. But as it is, even Xros Wars (which has gained a fair amount of unpopularity) appeals to me more.

    It isn&#039;t my favorite digimon but it&#039;s not bad either, i&#039;m giving it a 7 because it isn&#039;t as good as Tamers or Adventure 01 but it isn&#039;t that much inferior, i think it&#039;s pretty generic which i don&#039;t think it&#039;s bad since i&#039;m not into cult stuff but i felt like nothing on this anime besides the last episode made me feel excited at all, the opening and ending are very good but i didn&#039;t like the evolution song Adventure 02 and Tamers have far better Evolution soundtracks, the villains are very good though a shame that they only appear later in the series

    Well... I&#039;m glad that&#039;s over.<br />
This is my first &quot;review&quot; on MAL, and I will be blunt here. Take some of my thoughts with grain of salt, because the review is less organized, than I&#039;d like it to be.<br />
<br />
Before you leave, I won&#039;t bash Savers, because it &quot;ruined my childhood anime&quot;. I went in hopeful for a change of setting.<br />
<br />
There will be some spoilers.<br />
<br />
Digimon Savers is the first full length Digimon series since Digimon Frontier in 2002-3. I&#039;ve seen quite a few people praise it for &quot;saving Digimon&quot; and being more &quot;mature&quot;, than it&#039;s predecessors. For starters, it has more aggression and main cast aging from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232726">
        mid teens to early twenties (with some variables), so it must be more mature. Right? Well.. no. It&#039;s not. I dare say it&#039;s even more childish than Frontier was.<br />
<br />
But would that be a bad thing on it&#039;s own? No. Definitely not. Seeing the first few episodes, I actually thought it would become a silly shounen adventure by the end.<br />
It didn&#039;t.<br />
It was actually aimed at a more &quot;mature&quot; audience, unlike the series prior and for that reason, after the initial few episodes went down, it turned into a &quot;serious business&quot; show. <br />
It didn&#039;t hit the mark. <br />
<br />
(I won&#039;t give points. Since everyone rates differently, I find them generally less useful than they&#039;re shown to be. What a 5 means to one person can be very different to what it means for another. I will give impressions instead.)<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is about a cardboard cutout shounen manga protagonist saving the world with his fists. (Take this at face value.) Everything else is just a semi-bland mesh of spices. <br />
I don&#039;t dislike simple stories. Simple stories can be great. However even the simplest of stories need something entertaining going for them. This story you can experience by reading almost any shounen manga or by watching almost any shounen anime in a much more entertaining manner. The only thing different here are the Digimon as a choice for Monster of the Week monsters. You can predict most of it by looking at the first 15 episodes. Or watching every 4th one. Doesn&#039;t make a lick of difference. Considering all this, the story could have been charming if it was somewhat played for laughs. It wasn&#039;t. The plot takes itself extremely seriously and given it&#039;s subject matter it&#039;s completely laughable. Except I cried. <br />
<br />
What if it had a nice set of characters? <br />
About that...<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
The main cast is a mess, but there are some unpolished gems. Too bad next to nothing is expanded on any of the characters except the main four and 1 or 2 others. <br />
<br />
The main four are: <br />
<br />
Masaru doesn&#039;t grow even a little bit as a character. He is depicted and is supposed to be accepted as an idealistic view on a &quot;MAN&quot;. This is demonstrated though him beating up others (including Digimon) and through this they start to respect him, because he &quot;talked to them with his fists&quot; and &quot;that&#039;s the way a man does things&quot;. He is like this until literally the last frame and is presented extremely seriously. I hoped that he would grow out of this personality or do something productive with it, like all other digimon protags, but he didn&#039;t. The other saving option would have been that the story and he himself turns purposely corny. This doesn&#039;t happen either. He is a worthless character in every sense of the word. <br />
<br />
Tohma has a little bit more growth as a person than Masaru, but it&#039;s still filled with overdone clichés and exaggerated, meaningless drama. He is mostly only there to be the rival trope for the self-insert protag.<br />
<br />
Yoshino is there, because &quot;cool older sister&quot; trope. That&#039;s it. She has no character arc. No, that one episode doesn&#039;t count.<br />
<br />
Ikuto has by far the most well made character arc, but sadly, as many a reviewer said before me: No matter how much you polish a turd, it won&#039;t become a piece of gold. He is a little shithead through the first ~20 episodes he&#039;s featured in. After that he becomes completely docile until the end. He has two agendas. The first one: HUMAN=EVIL, next one HUMAN+DIGIMON=GOOD. He&#039;s supposed to represent the &quot;humans&#039; potential to live alongside digimon peacefully&quot; and &quot;HUMAN EVOLUTION&quot; ((within the context of the Digimon shows: growing up)). (In contrast, in all other Digimon series before this, all characters had this happen to them very naturally and mostly without being constantly hammered through the &quot;retarded viewer&#039;s&quot; skull.)<br />
<br />
Some of the others:<br />
<br />
The partner digimon are cute but that&#039;s it. They have basic personalities. Agumon is always hungry and is the same as Masaru. Gaomon is a butler. Lalamon is... well.. sometimes a straight man to Yoshino I guess? Falcomon is mostly a mirror to Ikuto. Kamemon had some potential, but he is mostly just there, saying and doing nothing. Sometimes he fights alongside Yushima. The two PawnChessmon are purely for support, same for their tamers. Kudamon and Satsuma combo is fun to listen to sometimes, but they&#039;re filling the bare minimum roles of &quot;a father to his men&quot;-type boss characters.<br />
<br />
There is one supporting character who&#039;s constantly mentioned through the entire series. He&#039;s Masaru&#039;s dad. He is the same as Masaru and nothing is really done with him other than constant praise by everyone. He&#039;s basically a &quot;means to an end&quot; character. He&#039;s mainly used to justify happenings in the story.<br />
<br />
The enemy characters were explained with: <br />
&quot;He&#039;s a cackling evil scientist, kill him.&quot; and &quot;He&#039;s an emotionless algorithm, kill him.&quot;<br />
The first one has a long and drawn-out buildup, basically shoving a shitton of &quot;kick the dog&quot; moments to show how he&#039;s evil because he&#039;s evil. The other antagonist on the other hand comes out of nowhere and blames the entire humanity for one man&#039;s actions and decides in his infinite wisdom to kill everyone. His followers obey him without any questions or showing any character until the last two episodes.<br />
<br />
The characters I enjoyed seeing were few and far between, but here they are in no particular order: Mercurimon, Craniummon, Satsuma, Kudamon, Yushima. <br />
I also love hearing that voice actor from the mouth of Dukemon (even though at first it was a bit jarring to hear Tamers Guilmon&#039;s voice back from Savers Dukemon).<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
Mediocre, but I won&#039;t fault Toei. Making Saturday morning stuff with limited time (and lack of direction and probably a lack of faith from the higher-ups) is definitely not easy. Especially in the mid 2000s, making a promo, monster of the week show for Digimon. At least the battles were spectacular and a lot better than the first two and the fourth series&#039; battles and most CGI wasn&#039;t bad. (Except for the MachGaogamon evolution. Every time the frame-rate drops form 24 to 3, a little bit of my soul evaporates.) <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
One of the better points. The openings are nice and energetic, the endings are calming (though not sure how fitting they are for this kind of presentation). The Evolution song is one that I really like. It&#039;s the perfect song to just shout loud. I love it. The other OST is not bad, but I can&#039;t hum any of it after watching the whole series. It&#039;s just there. Sometimes I remember it fitting the atmosphere, but most of the time I can&#039;t recall any of it. The voice acting cast is good enough, though Yoshino&#039;s voice actress sounds extremely uninterested half the time.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
Poor. I enjoyed how they showed us the characters in the first couple of episodes and I remember thinking &quot;Huh, this is vastly different from before, but so far I like it! I wonder how they&#039;ll make them likeable or what story will go around them!&quot;<br />
If you&#039;ve read this far, you already know the answer to those questions. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
I did not enjoy Digimon Savers. It was a copy-paste of the first volume of any shounen manga story about school gang-fighting and how that&#039;s honorable. Add some Digimon and that&#039;s it. The characters don&#039;t change, which was one of the cornerstones of the previous four Digimon series. The story is by the numbers and even like this, it&#039;s taken bloody seriously. Last but not least, the show treats the viewers like morons. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t find a single reason to watch this anime over basically any other shounen of similar length or indeed any Digimon series that aired before it. If you honestly enjoyed it or can take the piss out of it, I&#039;m happy for you. Sadly I couldn&#039;t.

    If you are looking for a beginner anime. I totally recommend this show, i know the ratings aren&#039;t that good but in my opinion it was my favorite childhood show.<br />
<br />
Story : 10/10<br />
Character development : 10/10<br />
OVERALL : 10/10<br />
 <br />
<br />
I rly liked this show <br />

    This is my first review, so please bear with me because I am not used to writing reviews.Oh, and please bear with me if you love the anime because I will be a little critical about this.<br />
<br />
Digimon Savers is a sequel to the other Digimon seasons. The main character is  Masaru Daimon who loves to fight. His Digimon is a new Agumon, and I&#039;m saying new because this Agumon doesn&#039;t look like the old Agumon we all know and love. This fella is taller, his nostrils are bigger and he has these weird red bracers.<br />
<br />
Now I haven&#039;t watched a lot of this season, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64535">
        I have dropped it but I might come back to it. Why? Well the story in my opinion is pretty good. It might not interest some Digimon fans into watching it since the story has changed quite a bit. These guys don&#039;t go into the virtual world that we know as the Digital World people. However, the series is quite funny in some stages.<br />
<br />
Art looks generally alright, this is what IO wouold expect from an anime, especially from the year this was made. The colours are beautful and some of the backgrounds are nice and detailed, simply lovely.<br />
<br />
The sound is pretty good as well, it&#039;s nice to listen to and it changes into well fitted music for each scene. Nothing else needs to be said here!<br />
<br />
The characters are quite good in their own sense. The development in these characters are shown straight from the first episode. From the first episode you knwo the main character loves to fight, and he ends up fighting with Agumon and stuff. Throughout the anime and the storyline, you get to really know the characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, eh? Well I did enjoy this quite a lot, but the one thing that annoyed me the most was how Agumon looked. No-one can really blame me on this, since I&#039;ve grown up with Pokemon and Digimon, and the monsters on these ttwo shows. If I see a Digimon I love get changed then I wouldn&#039;t say &#039;yay&#039;, I would say &#039;ney&#039; because I grew up loving that Digimon. However, Digimon Savers is a good anime. I might even start watching again after finishing this review.

    First off if you enjoyed ANY of the previous series, I don&#039;t recommend this one. Some of the other seasons connected with each other this one COMPLETELY DID NOT!! The art was totally different and  it didn&#039;t have the same feel as the previous seasons. The characters weren&#039;t that likeable in my opinion. They attempted to make a new story and bring Digimon back but this was not the way to do it. WORST DIGIMON series so far. I tried to give it a shot by watching the first 5 but it just was not doing it for me. I tried to watch it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28760">
        in both English and in Japanese, neither worked for me. The voices in the English were horrible as well. I&#039;m an aesthetic person and the art was what turned me off the most though on this. Story was next.

    Digimon Savers is for me the best season of Digimon, because it has a more serious story and the characters are very interesting, especially the villain (Kurata).<br />
I consider this the best season of Digimon of all

    Here is my first review for an anime that I watch (I have been watching anime since I&#039;m 10 years old, and now I&#039;m 26 years old). Due to Digimon Savers &quot;excellent animation and story&quot; I have to write one as to warn people who love Digimon franchise.<br />
<br />
Story : I have to agree that Digimon Savers has the most unique storytelling compare to other digimon franchise. Not only the main characters is someone who is old (compare to others, where most of the character is 10-13 years old) most of character is 14 years old and above. Not only that, they have their own squad,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216177">
        and the story doesn’t start from digital world (I don’t know if this considered as spoiler, but it is all there in Episode 1). But, background story and how they meet their digimon is not clearly told (except for daimon and yoshino). I give 7/10 for the story<br />
<br />
Character : here is the downfall of this anime. The main character somehow outshines all digimon including his own digimon, agumon. Not only that, most of the digimon’s size is HUGEE (well, it is not the main problem, they look cute anyway). Using your will and emotion only can’t save you all the time, well unless you are Daimon, then it is possible. I give 6/10. Why 6? Because there is Tohma Norstein,  Yoshino and Ikuto characters somehow save this series and made it enjoyable to me.<br />
<br />
Sound : The opening, ending and insert song is not catchy enough for me compared to Tamers, 01 and 02. I didn’t skip the opening, so that somehow i can fall in love with the opening, but i still don’t like it. I give 5/10 out of generosity.<br />
<br />
Art : the animation is so far okay. It’s not bad but not that good. You can still watch it and enjoy (it doesn&#039;t give you any eye cancer). I give 7/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : From the first episode until around 29, I plan to give 10/10 to this series, but after that, the story just fall over the cliff for no reason. I can’t say that I enjoyed but i was a fun ride to finish this series although most probably in this near future, I won’t re watch it, maybe 5-8 years later. I give 5/10.<br />
<br />
After watching 48 episode include the special episode, I have conclude that the most powerful Digimon is Daimon. And if you somehow despise Daimon, you will have a hard time to finish this series. Watch it, and you will understand.<br />
<br />

    I am still watching, but here is my review.<br />
<br />
It is not like any other Digimon series before it, but that is not a bad thing!<br />
It starts of in the human world, were the government is hunting down Digimon, much like in Tamers, but the main characters are working with the government in order to keep there digimon friends by there side.<br />
I like that Masaru is so far the only street fighter in a Digimon series, he is strong enough to fight one on one with a Digimon.<br />
<br />
I knew from the start at some point Touma would join the bad side, even though I do not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111749">
        think it will last long.<br />
All three have good back stories, but Yoshino&#039;s is lacking a bit, but her character is like the useless adult trying to act helpful.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure that by the random scenes I saw when i started the show, that Masaru&#039;s dad is some one more important than what they think, I have no idea what Yigdrasill does in this story, but I will see.<br />
The art has improved a lot since the last Digimon series, and it has better back round music.<br />
<br />
Over all, it is a good story, with of course a lot of selfish parents, like most Digimon series, and it has a lot of action!!!

    This season is really underrated<br />
<br />
Story (6)<br />
This whole premise is about an organization known as DATS who capture wild digimon and take them to the Digital World. For the first third of the season starts out bland and just your typical &quot;MOW&quot; (Monster of the week) formula, by episode 13. You finally could take the show seriously the second third of season just focus on their exploration of the Digital World and we found out more on how Digimon is roaming into the human world and meet our antagonist of the show, Karata. He plans to whipe out all the Digimon with his man made Digimon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208632">
        known as Gizumon. The Gizumon comes from Digimon DNA except he doesn&#039;t have a heart. His plot were actually totally devious. Now the third half is where they jumped the shark. Honestly the King Drasil (mind you I watched the dub) Arc was quite boring. Granted, it was okay that we get to know more about Kudamon and we find out that he&#039;s was a Royal Knight by his Mega Level Kentarosmon. But aside from that I wasn&#039;t amazed from this Arc. That where Data Squad (Savers) suffered.<br />
<br />
Characters (9)<br />
Each character pretty much developed alot. Marcus started off as a reckless jerk with no type of common sense. But later on he realizes that he can&#039;t just rely on his fist all the time. Thomas started as a douchebag by just being a smartass. But he gets much nicer at later on. He even had to trick his friends just to save his own sister. I can&#039;t say much about Yoshi except she becomes more friendly.. But that&#039;s it. Now Keenan had the most. He started as a kid who hated Digimon we soon realizes their was a reason to it. His Digi-mother Frigimon was killef by Gizumon. Merucimon and Marcus convinces him that human aren&#039;t bad. At the end of the day, Keenan becomes more forgiving to humans except Karata.<br />
<br />
Art (6):<br />
The animation aren&#039;t that bad. The CGI in the evolution sequences weren&#039;t bad.<br />
<br />
Music (5):<br />
When watching the dub the sounds are so generic asf.<br />

    Before i begin the review i should inform the readers that i&#039;ll be writing this review as an old Digimon fan so i&#039;ll be comparing this to the older seasons a lot so plz bear with me. <br />
<br />
Review summary :-<br />
Savers/Data Squad is an odd throwback to the original Digimon adventure formula with some of the most questionable changes that makes Digimon frontier seem normal in comparison.<br />
<br />
========<br />
STORY (5/10)<br />
========<br />
To sum it up the premise is basically Power rangers+Men in Black+Digimon.<br />
<br />
Random teenagers  with &quot;attitude&quot; wearing colourful costumes work for a top secret agency to keep the monsters away from the human world and if you&#039;re STILL not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186205">
        convinced then they made it obvious by the use &quot;neuralizers&quot; and how Digimons follow a consistent pattern of turning into Giants,till this season Size never really mattered in Digimon but in this season apparently everything has to be of EPIC proportions,it also strives to be all dark&amp;edgy but refuses to actually be mature&amp;logically coherent like Tamers was,its all flash and no substance. <br />
<br />
For ex: In the older seasons(Adventure&amp;Tamers) adults&amp;children alike interacted with each other like actual human beings but here the characters act like they&#039;re from Ranma 1/2,even in extremely serious&amp;dangerous situations the characters are busy throwing snarky nonchalant remarks at each other whereas parents of the teens are just stock  anime characters who are less believable than Digimons.<br />
<br />
And to top it all off... unlike the other seasons where children had to rely on their partners&amp;parents and bond with them to survive here that complex character development structure is reduced to DBZ logic,screaming&amp;willing for power basically gives them more power and people can be brought back from dead there is no need for personal introspections or realistic family problems,its mostly about being ass kicking angsty teens who have a dysfunctional relationship with each other and mostly apathetic relations with their own parents.<br />
 <br />
and that&#039;s pretty much the gist of it,nothing really substantial happens till Ep 24 mark, avoiding any major spoilers the &quot;Kurata Arc&quot; is pretty much the high point of this season and then after that it starts recycling old plot elements from tamers&amp;adventure like how both digimon&amp;humans fight together against a new enemy which threatens both worlds and how the hot blooded guy has a duel with the level headed guy,except this time its not as well written.<br />
<br />
============<br />
CHARACTERS (3/10) <br />
============<br />
-------------------<br />
Marcus/Masaru :-<br />
-------------------<br />
Before i delve into this character let me inform you that THIS guy is the main protagonist of this season,80% of spotlight is reserved for him,if you don&#039;t like him the very least the chances are you&#039;re not going to like the entire season.<br />
<br />
Our main &quot;protagonist&quot; is a 15 yr old street thug with an IQ of a rock(he goes to school and doesn&#039;t know what is a VIRUS is!) and from his crazy violent behaviour i can only guess that he has a testosterone imbalance.   <br />
<br />
His physical feats are outrageous he can Jump 40 ft in the air and still manage to give a K.O punch to a giant monster AND land perfectly fine without fracturing his legs.. if that&#039;s not absurd enough for you then he can also nosedive his fist directly into a giant titanium shield AND break it.<br />
<br />
BTW the &quot;DNA charge&quot; doesn&#039;t seem to allow Thomas&amp;Yoshino or anyone else to do these inhumane feats,heck marcus was able to seriously beat the crap out of Garurumon(A giant fox) without DNA charge.<br />
<br />
So putting THAT aside he is just an unlikeable douchebag! his attitude is impulsive,rude&amp;inconsiderate and he NEVER changes,he has no chemistry with any of the other main characters he even treats his partner agumon like a subordinate thug.<br />
<br />
It is in stark contrast to the original season where kids had vibrant personalities and they all worked with each other like a family and they learned NOT to be impulsive&amp;inconsiderate(Skullgreymon Episode) but here the show glorifies marcus&#039;s thuggish  shenanigans.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
Yoshino:-<br />
----------<br />
If you search for &quot;Token  Anime girl&quot;  on google you&#039;d most likely see yoshino&#039;s photo on the front page.. she&#039;s the textbook definition of that she&#039;s bland,boring,shallow,whiny and much like marcus she never changes!<br />
<br />
It is quite BAFFLING to me that despite being a main character she  has ABSOLUTELY ZERO relevance to the plot like AT ALL and her partner is just as forgettable&amp;bland as her.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
Thomas:-<br />
----------<br />
He&#039;s yet another angsty tsundere/child prodigy he&#039;s basically batman if he was a 15 yr old with too much estrogen,his partner is a loyal dog kinda like gabuwhatever.<br />
<br />
But TBH compared the psycho thug and the miss bland universe Thomas is actually likeable&amp;interesting he has a decent backstory but his character arc is rushed,his relationship with his sister just isn&#039;t built up  as well as taichi&#039;s bond with Kari or the bond of henry&amp;suzie.<br />
<br />
In other words Thomas&#039;s sister&#039;s(much like marcus&#039;s sister) is a very generic moe girl NOT like a real life child.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
Kurata:-<br />
--------<br />
He&#039;s easily the best character in this season too bad he has the Evil scientist syndrome but TBH most of villains in Digimon series have been just evil for no good reason but Kurata is a human which makes it kind of weird.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless he&#039;s a joy to watch he&#039;s sleazy,he uses politics and dirty tricks to archive his goals.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
Keenan/Itsuno:-<br />
-----------------<br />
A feral child raised by digimom and even though almost all digimons can speak fluently he speaks like Tarzan &quot;Me digimon hate Hoomans!&quot; i guess he&#039;s just retarded,whatever he&#039;s still  better than the psycho thug too bad the show again rushes his mother&#039;s relationship thus ending his character arc.<br />
<br />
His mother also comes off as uncomfortably inappropriate in one episode.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
ARTSTYLE (4/10)<br />
==========<br />
The artstlye is kind of  a mixed bag.. its vivid and doesn&#039;t have the tradmark &quot;Digimon&quot; artstyle on the surface it just looks like another generic anime.<br />
<br />
the main problem is with the animation and the character&amp;Digimon designs... the animation is very inconsistent in quality,sometimes its very choppy,sometimes its smooth,sometimes the black outline is overly prominent,the adult 30+ women look like they&#039;re in the early college years.<br />
<br />
and then there&#039;s Digimon&#039;s butchered proportions  now to understand the problem you have to first consider the fact that the official designs for most of the digimons from Bandai are not supposed to be that Big.. yet Savers takes the liberty to make Digimons who were never intended to be taller than your average 10 yr old  taller than a goddamn skyscraper. <br />
<br />
and they can&#039;t even draw agumon with a consistent height sometimes he&#039;s drawn as if he&#039;s as tall as Masaru where its clearly the animator&#039;s fault.<br />
<br />
=============<br />
SOUNDTRACK (8/10)<br />
=============<br />
Its Digimon OST! i&#039;m no big fan of J-pop songs really these insert songs are just amazing no matter what season these songs are guaranteed to grow on you, at first i didn&#039;t even like &quot;believer&quot; but then slowly it became one of my fav Digimon songs.<br />
<br />
The jap OST also has latin songs for EPIC moments XD clichéd&amp;cheesy yes but awesome nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The U.S dubbing also has decent rock/metal BGM and nice evolution theme  but i&#039;d definitely suggest you watch the original as some of the insert songs just make the show much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
===========<br />
CONCLUSION 6/10<br />
===========<br />
This is a decent Shonen/action anime which takes painfully long to start going somewhere and it just doesn&#039;t feel like &quot;Digimon&quot; its too mean spirited ,lacks any semblance of realism(character wise),maturity&amp;mysticism which the series is known for,if you aren&#039;t a fan of Digimon and are just looking a fun action packed anime watch Hellsing OVA instead.
