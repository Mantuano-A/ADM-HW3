    *Edit* There are spoilers in this review. I was under the impressions that spoilers required a plot that was coherent enough to spoil, but after some complaints I decided to put in this warning*<br />
<br />
Before Fractale aired, the dir­ector Yamakan declared that moe was the can­cer that was killing the anime industry and that he would cre­ate a show that stepped out­side that and appeal to a wider audi­ence (not quite in those words, but that was the gen­eral gist of his ram­blings). He even man­aged to get him­self a slot in the fam­ous Noit­am­ina timeslot, a place ded­ic­ated to host­ing anime that don’t suck, for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35588">
        his upcom­ing per­sonal ori­ginal anime pro­duc­tion Fractale. This is all pretty ironic to look back on, because Fractale proved to be:<br />
<br />
   1. Moe<br />
   2. Bear­ing a whole lot of other stand­ard anime tropes<br />
   3. Shit<br />
<br />
Fractale sets itself out as a sci-fi show set in a post-scarcity world where nobody inter­acts with each other because they can cre­ate dop­pels to do that for them. There­fore every­one lives in com­plete lux­ury in whatever set­ting with whatever types of people they choose to live with. It’s an inter­est­ing set­ting and one that Fractale occa­sion­ally explores but never attacks, almost as if they brought up that plot point by acci­dent and it has noth­ing to do with the overly­ing theme of the anime. Occa­sion­ally the show will come across a char­ac­ter who uses the Fractale sys­tem in cer­tain ways that seem like a fas­cin­at­ing explor­a­tion of that character’s psyche, but then aban­dons said char­ac­ter pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
One of the points brought up early on by the Fractale sys­tem is that people liv­ing in it don’t exper­i­ence proper human con­tact. The whole point of the first epis­ode is show­ing the main char­ac­ter, Clain, and his baffle­ment and embar­rass­ment with meet­ing a real live in the flesh human girl, who pro­ceeds to strip in front of him. You would think this would there­fore be a run­ning theme through­out the show, but that was ignored pretty quickly. The closest it got was hav­ing another female char­ac­ter call Clain a per­vert in about 5 times per epis­ode. I’m guess­ing the show thought it was being funny by say­ing this? I dunno, it’s not like Clain was doing any­thing per­ver­ted any­way, was that the joke?<br />
<br />
It did try to cover basic human inter­ac­tions as part of the plot, but this was even more laugh­ably tackled. Over the course of the show, Clain sees these people he has joined up with, the Lost Mil­len­nium group, who are against the Fractale sys­tem, mow down old gran­nies. It offered the viewer two sides of the story, the Fractale Sys­tem and the Lost Mil­len­nium group that opposed it. But that one good scene was instantly deval­ued by ignor­ing it from there on in and intro­du­cing another eviler group of the Lost Mil­len­nium, mak­ing the mas­sacre of gran­nies from the group Clain were with seem like a totally cool thing in com­par­ison. This comes to a head towards the end where Clain joins in the granny gen­o­cide cam­paign, telling the Good Lost Mil­len­nium group that it’s OK that you kill people because you’re my friends!<br />
<br />
That’s just the themes seem to appear more often, but other parts of the plot make far less sense. The plot fin­ishes up on a rev­el­a­tion that God is not 16 years old, but actu­ally 10 and there­fore pure. What this had to do with any­thing I have no idea, but Fractale seemed to like telling us this in a very dra­matic fash­ion. The Fractale Sys­tem bad guys were equally baff­ling, also obsessed with pur­ity for whatever reason and gen­er­ally being a deranged bunch of lun­at­ics who filled their armies with sui­cidal gran­nies. For a show that seemed to be present­ing both sides of the argu­ments, surely you shouldn’t have the Fractale guys be such a bunch of lun­at­ics who like lick­ing the face of our brave heroine?<br />
<br />
Now this could all be fine in another series. You can be silly but still have a lot of fun. First off, Fractale isn’t fun, unless 10 ref­er­ences to Clain being a per­vert per epis­ode is your idea of a good time. But mainly, Fractale pre­tends it’s deep. It’s all about Themes and Issues and is Like Totally Ser­i­ous. But it brings up these points with no idea what it’s doing with them. It’s like it has taken ideas and scenes from other anime it’s seen, real­ised that these scenes make this anime great and stuck them into Fractale without real­ising why these scenes make that other anime great. You can have psychotic vil­lains who lick their pure heroines, but not in a show where your also try­ing to present a bal­anced view of those sides of the conflict.<br />
<br />
The reason I hate Fractale is because it offends the story-telling lover part of me. This is not some­thing that is appar­ent in the early epis­odes. This is some­thing that only rears its true ugly head in the later epis­odes where it tries to bring its plot to some sort of non­sensical con­clu­sion. It has taken a lot of dif­fer­ent plot points but has never con­sidered how they tie in together. It’s thrown out scene with Deep Mean­ing without real­ising that the mean­ing that scene pro­trays has noth­ing to do with whatever pre­vi­ous scenes the show has had, or even con­tra­dicts pre­vi­ous plot points. I’m guess­ing the Fractale Pro­duc­tion Com­mit­tee meet­ing went some­thing like this.<br />
<br />
— OK guys, this anime Fractale is going to be so awe­some! It will have a girl who you can only touch if you like her. That means Love is import­ant and stuff<br />
<br />
–And his par­ents will be a water cooler and a pink lampshade<br />
<br />
–And then the rest of the team will betray him, but he was actu­ally work­ing for the priest­ess all along<br />
<br />
–The big-breasted girl will actu­ally be an old man<br />
<br />
–But then it will turn out it was his dad all along<br />
<br />
–She was talk­ing to the Cart Driver, who turns out was actu­ally the main character!<br />
<br />
Yamakan: –Great Ideas! We’ll put them all in!

    I&#039;m gonna come out and say that Fractale isn&#039;t that bad... and all the hate people have for it is kinda unjustified. The problem is that the show didn&#039;t manage to become the kind of masterpiece Yamakan wanted it to be, and that failed promise put the show in a very negative light. At least he&#039;s a man of his word, and &quot;retired for the time being&quot;. It&#039;s a pity if he actually goes away for good because I still think he&#039;s still someone with plenty of talent, and even some of that does show in the flop that is Fractale.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve said this on more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37300">
        than one occasion, that I&#039;d like to compare this series with Last Exile or Allison to Lillia, because I strongly feel that that is Yamakan&#039;s vision for Fractale. It isn&#039;t so much about the story, but it&#039;s about the fabulous combo of pre-industrial age technology meets young man&#039;s (or girl&#039;s) adventure. Series like these usually focus a lot more of the setting of the story, like the common people&#039;s way of life, community relationships, the environment, the history than most other shows do. This is probably Yamakan&#039;s take on the cincept, with a little furturistic element to it. And I really like that. Fractale shows the fun in a frugal and simple way of living, clean and honest community life, its conflict with furturistic technology, and a young man&#039;s adventure in his role and approach towards this conflict.<br />
<br />
Whereas the show fails hard on its execution and characters. First of all, there is too little revealed about the Fractale system itself, and we the audience are left with too many questions about practically everything that is going on. That won&#039;t be a problem if the characters are interesting enough to drive the show along, but they aren&#039;t. Clain is constantly being led by the nose by everyone around him, and his actions are always a result of how the story drives him, when it should be the other way around. Phyrne and Nessa are as mysterious as the Fractale system itself, and everyone else is there just to fill up the screen time. In the ending, there&#039;s wasn&#039;t a resolution or anything. It feels like it all happened as a matter of course. I&#039;ll keep this spoiler-free, but it&#039;s a happy, but really dumb ending.<br />
<br />
Another thing that&#039;s sorely missing from Fractale is satisfying animation, which is something I&#039;m expecting to see from an anime using this concept. I&#039;m totally expecting spectacular backgrounds, detailed characters or equipment, or at least smooth animating, but Fractale delivered none. I can&#039;t explain how disappointed I was.<br />
<br />
So in all, Fractale is okay. If you understand and love the concept of animes I was talking about, you&#039;ll enjoy Fractale to a certain extent. Otherwise, it probably isn&#039;t something for you.<br />
<br />
Plot/Concept: Great<br />
Story Style: Miserable<br />
Audio/Visual: Fair<br />

    This show was actually awful.<br />
<br />
I really liked the colorful and simple style of the show so I looked more into it. I read the summary and thought it could be really okay. And then I made the mistake of watching it.<br />
<br />
It is the kind of overall bad that I cannot pin point just where they went horribly wrong. It is like that time you tried making dinner and you followed a recipe pretty strictly but it tasted awful and you didn&#039;t know what you did to ruin everything. <br />
<br />
All of the characters are faceless and not worth mentioning, I can&#039;t even remember any of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178962">
        music and I was rewatching a few episodes today to reminisce the pain I suffered from enduring this god forsaken piece of crap. The story even had potential but the implementation was just wonky.<br />
<br />
I recommend this anime to anyone looking for an ironic marathon with a friend. The two of you can laugh at how bad it is for weeks to come.

    Of the entire Winter Anime list, Fractale instantly caught my attention, perhaps because of all the words written on the list, “fractal” is the term that I have encountered several times. I enjoy this show because it has some in-depth meanings on how technology impacts humans and apparent socio-political implications. Also, I find it unique and refreshing in its own simple ways.<br />
<br />
In terms of character design, I find them pleasing but not really fantastic. However, you can surely recognize the character development. I particularly like Nessa, I thought she is going to be annoying doppel--data or memory that interacts like human, who will screw up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34386">
        on everything, but it turned out that she is lovable, and despite her age I find her more intelligent and sensible than Phryne. As for Cain, I truly enjoyed his character, I witnessed how he grows up from being immature young boy to a mature young man. Overall, at the end of the series I sensed that the characters grew into me, because even the secondary characters like Sunda and Enri are worth mentioning when you talk about Fractale.<br />
<br />
Artwise, it has nice and friendly ambiance. However, I find the color tone and setting somewhat old-fashioned, but I guess that what makes it unique and easy to follow. The setting is supposed to be futuristic however they incorporated farms, valleys and plateaus, perhaps that&#039;s why they used that &quot;classic&quot; a ambiance.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I almost lost my enthusiasm after seeing the first episode; the show seemed to be too shallow and carefree for me—that time I wanted to see something that is extremely thought provoking and emotion driven. Little did I know, behind light ambience is where the irony hides. It is good that I did not drop it right away and stick-around until episode three, because that is where the story begins to unfold.<br />
<br />
A quick snippet of Fractale is it tells the story of a young boy named Clain. One day, he saw a temple girl named Phryne being chased by three armed people. Eventually, Phryne managed to get away from her chasers. After seeing her wounded, Clain brought her home for treatment and also helped her to hide from those who are trailing her.<br />
<br />
The incongruity and the bulk of the story is in the title itself; Fractale system pledges a life of pure relaxation and technology-driven lives. However, due to the overly convenient lifestyles, people do not talk to each other and do not work for a living anymore. Further, the extreme dependency in technology is turning people into less “humans”. For instance, families in Fractale System do not live together anymore, and people just spend their days stagnant.<br />
<br />
Now, if we are going to look at the definition of fractal, it means rough, fragmented geometric shapes and reduced-size exact copy of the whole—opposite to the symmetric and smooth lifestyle that Fractale system offers. We can see that Indeed, Fractale system is the provider of the “whole package” of convenience to its citizens, however this supposedly “whole” is actually in a form of the reduced-size of the real thing. Aside from that, instead of being part of the entire picture, people continuously sprout out as isolated entities of the picture, or simply the petite-sized reset of the Fractale system.<br />
<br />
I truly believe that the author successfully incorporated the characteristic and symbolism of fractal in the story.<br />
<br />
*mild spoiler ahead*<br />
The last episode is kind of rushed. I really think it&#039;s a pre-mature last episode and it&#039;s not the type of ending that I&#039;m expecting however it didn&#039;t disappoint me. This is just purely my opinion though. Now it&#039;s up to you to find out what you think about the Fractale.

    I like Fractale. I really do. But more I reflect on it, more I realize that Fractale isn&#039;t the greatest.<br />
<br />
What caught me was the setting. A computerized system called &quot;Fractale&quot;  is used to catalog and maintain the whole human population. A normal boy named Clain is unsatisfied with his life. In comes Phyrne, a doppel named Nessa, a rebel group called the Lost Millennium, and the Temple knocking on his door. He&#039;s dragged into a whole world altering mess of conflicts... so why is this show so slow moving?<br />
<br />
The pacing isn&#039;t very well done. A show is supposed to raise questions in the beginning

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35933">
        and answer them in the end. This show fails at the latter. It moves slowly, adding to the setting, and suddenly accelerates into some action the last 2 episodes, leaving you to scratch your head in confusion. &quot;What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
The show leaves so many questions unanswered. What is the Fractale system, and how does it work? I don&#039;t mean some half assed explanation that it uses star power or anything or that it&#039;s some mystical computer system designed by aliens. I&#039;m just asking WHAT IS IT. When the show fails to explain the main plot point, it starts getting silly. Phyrne is the key to the Fractale system, and the Temple wants her back. But why IS she the key anyway? How does the whole key thing work? Do they just plug girls into the Temple like some AA batteries in order to keep the Fractale system running? <br />
<br />
And what exactly is the Lost Millennium&#039;s beef anyway? They&#039;re a rebel group. Sure. But what&#039;s their motives? They think the world sucks, and the audience sees the Fractale system isn&#039;t so great. But how in the world did they reach the conclusion that the world is a dystopia? People live in blissful ignorance of the Fractale&#039;s mechanizations, and are brainwashed every year. How did this group of people break out of this cycle? <br />
<br />
I blame this lack of information and question answering squarely on the protagonist. We&#039;re not supposed to sympathize with the Temple. They&#039;re the bad guys! We&#039;re apparently not supposed to sympathize with the Lost Millennium either (even though the Granites deserve our sympathy at some points). They&#039;re the bad guys too! And we&#039;re not supposed to understand or sympathize with Phyrne because she&#039;s simply just a plot coupon at this point. So who ARE we supposed to sympathize with? Clain. Our protagonist. Unfortunately, he acts as a third wheel. The Temple&#039;s not going to divulge its secrets to him because he&#039;s an enemy, Phyrne isn&#039;t going to say anything because she doesn&#039;t want him to get involved, and LM just wants him out of their hair. And since he&#039;s our protagonist, we have to learn information through him. If he&#039;s not getting any important information, then what are we, the audience, left with? Just a sequence of meaningless action on the screen, that&#039;s what. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s all supposed to make sense at the end. But when they throw a bunch of disjointed information, it&#039;s hard to synthesize it into something MEANINGFUL. And they expect everyone to be fine with this.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s just a crazy long over analysis. A show can be fun to watch and still have no &quot;plot&quot; to speak of. They say that the journey is as important as the destination, and it&#039;s been a fun ride. There&#039;s nothing too deep here. I say this a standard anime show, and I&#039;m glad there&#039;s not too much navel gazing or faux philosophy on how to live your life. If you have some time to kill and the premise sounds interesting, I say go take a look and see how it pans out for you. But if you have a packed schedule, I suggest you give this one a pass for the time being.

    As an anime fan, I personally love finding shows that take me completely by surprise.  Sure big hype shows are great too, but there’s something about finding an anime with little to no hype that turns out to be amazing that really strikes a cord with me.  I wasn’t expecting much from Fractale, but what I found was what is sure to be one of the best animes of the decade and an easy contender for anime of the year.<br />
<br />
Fractale is the story of an island governed by the Fractale system, a computer super-program that is worshipped as a religion by the people.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35783">
         Our main character is Clain, a boy who collects what he antiques (even though they’re things like Ipods and laptops) who meets a girl named Phryne.  Phryne has a mysterious connection with the Fractale system and gives Clain a doppel (essentially a holographic representative of a real person) child named Nessa.  Eventually Clain and crew meet a group of so-called revolutionaries called the Lost Millenium trying to bring down the Fractale system for good.  So is our story for this anime, and while it may seem simple, it is anything but.<br />
<br />
What makes Fractale so fantastic is just how brilliantly it is written every step of the way.  Clain, Nessa, and Phryne are three of the best written and believable anime characters I have seen recently who all act believably to every situation (no over-the-top anime reactions here).  In addition, the cast involved with Lost Milennium are also really well defined and avoid the usual noble rebel tropes in really interesting ways.  At points, the group acts more like guerilla terrorists than noble rebels.  Even though they are supposed to take down the Fractale system which they claim robs people of their humanity, are they any better by resorting to extreme tactics?  Though it is true that the Fractale system takes away people’s ability to be “human”, this aspect of the plot makes it much more interesting and thought provoking than it otherwise would have been.<br />
<br />
Another striking feature about the plot is the themes the show tackles.  While the more apparent themes of nature vs. technology are present, there are also hints of thematic elements dealing with the nature of organized religion.  The Fractale officials act as a theocracy even though the religion they promote doesn’t actually cause violence to others.  The themes of organized religion vs. free will in combination with nature vs. technology are a unique combination and the fact that it’s the people running both sides that aren’t innocent and not the ideas they represent make the conflict much more interesting to think about.  This leads to a conclusion that smartly addresses this dichotomy and represents some of the most well thought out and three dimensional writing you will find for anime this season.<br />
<br />
In addition to the fantastically written story line, the art in Fractale is in a word beautiful.  It’s very similar to a Hayao Miyazaki film asthetically with bright water color visuals and great character designs.  The entire show is just a joy to watch every second and really makes you appreciate how beautifully realized the entire production is.  On top of this, the music is fantastic with great orchestral scores that hit all the right notes, whether it’s the more action-orientated sequences or the quiet moments where the characters enjoy each other’s company.  <br />
<br />
This show just works on every single level.  The story is one of the best written animes in recent memory despite doing away with many fantasy anime tropes.  This, in addition with the fantastic characterization, art, and music all come together to make one of the best animes of the year.  Seriously, I cannot praise this anime enough, but I can’t because I don’t want to spoil anything for people.  Simply put, Fractale is one of the best animes you will see this year and you are doing yourself and the anime community a huge disservice by not watching it.<br />
<br />
I give Fractale, an A+.<br />

    Fractale is an original adventure anime with a teen/kid&#039;s movie vibe to it, with main characters in the 10-15 year old range. It takes place far in the future, but doesn&#039;t feel too futuristic. It&#039;s bright, colorful, detailed, with smooth and lively animation, and the settings are often beautiful and engrossing. The scenes flow nicely to give it a good pace. It&#039;s got friendship, comedy, and a bit of romance which are all well done, but the plot and adventure aspect suffers from being vague and lacking detail. There&#039;s some minor plot holes as well. These problems with the plot prevented me from getting sucked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35404">
        into the underlying plot of the show. Despite this, it was still entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Decent/good major feature, friend/family interaction and development:<br />
<br />
The main theme of the anime seems to center on the camaraderie between friends, family, and community as they live, work, have some fun together, and fight for their way of life which is to embrace a more simple and old-fashioned way of life (like our present day way of life). This is put up in contrast to the rest of society that is completely dependent on technology, some even living their lives through avatars rather than in person. The development between the three friends is interesting and stays fresh. The development with the larger group, which acts like an extended family, has good moments, but sometimes feels ordinary and maybe a bit clichéd. Overall, this aspect of the show is positive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Poor major feature, main conflict of the story:<br />
<br />
The area where I feel Fractale is lacking most is in giving background and explanation to the plot. There isn&#039;t much history or preexisting relations to add depth and complexity to the characters, factions, or world. It makes some things feel underdeveloped. The actions or plans the characters decide to carry out have minimal explanation. Where are we going and why? I know who the bad guys are, but what specifically are their capabilities that threaten us now? Some things that happen seem to need explanation but it&#039;s not given. Some things that happen are sudden and unexpected, and they should have at least been hinted at beforehand. This all makes it feel like the story can go anywhere it wants out of convenience, whether to the moon or to have someone start shooting laser beams out of their eyes (I exaggerate a bit). I&#039;d say the plot sacrifices quality for convenience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best feature, humor:<br />
<br />
Although comedy isn&#039;t the focus, funny moments pop up fairly often. They are usually good, and sometimes hilarious (sometimes with a dose of adorable from the constantly childlike cuteness of some characters). It&#039;s my favorite aspect of the anime. Most of the humor is based on either the characters&#039; quirky personalities and behaviors, misunderstandings, teasing, stupidity, or embarrassment. There&#039;s no slapstick or cheap forced humor here. It&#039;s all fits naturally with the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good but small feature, romance:<br />
<br />
Romance plays very small part in the show. Developments on this front are somewhat rare, but it&#039;s cute in those moments when it makes an appearance. And despite the low amount of plot dedicated to it, I still would get the feeling the character&#039;s heroic actions would positively affect the romance later.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good feature, setting and animation:<br />
<br />
Fractale is a bright, colorful, cheerful anime. Many scenes are beautiful and sometimes interestingly odd due to futuristic elements. It&#039;s always detailed. There is a bit of an epic feel to the setting of the anime because it&#039;s such an interesting futuristic world that feels fairly plausible, and all our current technology like computers and cameras are seen as ancient relics. The characters are very distinct. I enjoy the way they move around so fluidly and the way their hair sways. The animation adds positively to the anime and rarely feels boring.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
Though teens are most likely to relate strongest to the characters and situations in Fractale, it&#039;s still adult-friendly. The humor is quite good. The beautiful backgrounds and well animated characters make it visually pleasing. The characters&#039; interactions and development of friendship are enjoyable, even if sometimes a bit bland. The particularly childish characters are cute and funny. The bit of romantic aspects of the more mature characters is fun to watch. The show is really only hampered by an underlying plot that leaves some holes and seems to lack detail, as if it&#039;s written mainly to shake up the characters instead for its own sake. Still, the philosophical dilemma the plot explores is interesting, even if the conflict lacks a sense of urgency. I still enjoyed the show and found it easy to watch.

    Pretty strange show so far.<br />
There hasn&#039;t been much word of what this &quot;Fractale System&quot; is but it that will obviously be revealed as the story goes on, as the synopsis says.<br />
<br />
The character designs are pretty interesting, they&#039;re more movie-styled then for an anime to me, I would have thought this to be a movie if I saw a promotional video or something.<br />
<br />
Graphically, it&#039;s appealing. The back round objects are pretty damn detailed, in episode two there&#039;s a scene by the water that almost looked real, but because of this, at the same time the characters fit and don&#039;t fit the amount of detail put into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33924">
        the back round, making it seem kind of dull.<br />
<br />
Sound so far has been brilliant, it was interesting to see that the ED was sung all in English, rather than Japanese. Which I didn&#039;t expect, but the song itself certainly does suit the anime. Reminds me of a folk song actually.<br />
OP and ED, visually weren&#039;t very amazing. It looked as if the OP was made from things similar to that you see on windows media player, the ED isn&#039;t very good in this view either, but looking at it from a different perspective it still manages to keep itself attached to the emotions of the anime itself.<br />
<br />
Character personalities so far I think are pretty well choiced, Nessa is probably my favourite so far as I tend to favour energetic, happy characters. Although a character like that was expected in an anime like this.<br />
I probably shouldn&#039;t be, but I&#039;m surprised that there isn&#039;t someone who&#039;s a tsundere. There might be in later episodes though.<br />
<br />
It seems like it&#039;s a little bit of a backwater to me. As far as I know, the place they live in is the only place like that, although it&#039;s not proven but that&#039;s what it seems like. Technology there however is advanced, and everybody seems to love travelling and not staying put, which is why the development of digital &quot;avatars&quot; was put to use. I personally don&#039;t like the designs of the avatars, but it seems to blend with everything else so that&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
Overall I think this show has amazing potential. As with others of this winter.<br />
It&#039;s very different to what is usually presented to us. I&#039;ll give it a 9, so far.

    In an effort to reinvent the anime industry, Yutaka Yamamoto presents an anime with a premise focused on adventure and fantasy, a refreshing change from all the “rom coms” and ecchi comedies that each season seems to be flooded with, and which Fractale promises to deviate from. Does it hold up to its promise? The short answer: Good attempt, but not quite<br />
<br />
The long answer:<br />
<br />
The premise of Fractale is a gem among seinen/shonen anime, advertising a journey set out to discover just how the Fractale system works. What is the Fractale system? A giant plot device that threatens its inhabitants. Should it fail one day, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35545">
        will destroy the lives of those connected with it. Guarded and maintained by the supposed villains, and opposed by a collaborated group of umpteenth villages, the story of Fractale is little more than a war between religion and antireligion, with a twist thrown in to create potential discussion among viewers. As a whole, it reminds one of a generic RPG storyline (so generic that I have at least 3 games that seem to deal with a similar plot), which for a weekly, 1 cour anime, could very well be unique.<br />
<br />
Sadly though, the story in Fractale is a bit underdeveloped.  In the first half of the series, you&#039;re abruptly (though rather clumsily) thrown into the war which you, as the viewer, are sorta supposed to accept, without much information as to why the group known as Lost Millennium opposes the Fractale system, other than the fact that it apparently turns its users into zombies who can&#039;t properly live out their lives without technology to provide them with shelter, food, and even a goddamn minimum wage if you&#039;re unemployed (Pretty sure these are positive benefits, though I guess they prefer to be masochists). Afterwards, the story seems to literally turn into an RPG battle, where Lost Millennium and the Fractale Administrators do nothing but take turns making cheap shots at each other. The Fractale Administrators themselves are rather omniscient (they have a magic crystal ball that can basically reveal at least 90% of the world), and their giant floating temple of doom can shoot what appears to be an infinite supply of lasers, so why they don&#039;t just take out these rebel villages, thereby eliminating their only threat, is beyond me, but for the sake of lasting 11 episodes, God shows them mercy.<br />
<br />
While the turn-based battle that is the story unfolds, the character interactions dominate the story itself, quickly overshadowing the fantasy tale. While this isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, it deviates from my expectations, and left me slightly disappointed. It gets to the point that though I enjoyed Clain and Nessa&#039;s first meeting and subsequent shenanigans, I was hoping they&#039;d get to discussing the Fractale system. (Which doesn&#039;t fully take off until the end of episode 3)  The series likely would&#039;ve worked better as a two cour, as the characters themselves become the main focus, and the discovery of the Fractale system became a mere setting.<br />
<br />
Where the series starts off slow in the beginning, the pace accelerates out of control as the final episodes come around. Every final revelation, and lasting impression a character creates has much less impact that it could&#039;ve had if those moments or characters had been more developed. There&#039;s several implied actions which never hit the screen, and the final scene, though cute, felt incredibly soured by the lack of build up to it.  A two cour would have provide a balance between characters, drama, and story. As a one cour, the series tried to do too much in all three aspects and mixed up its own priorities, without really developing anything to a meaningful degree.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the characters themselves are fantastic. The main three characters, Clain, a techno-nostalgia geek, Phyrne, a rogue priestess, and Nessa, a mysterious avatar-esque “touchable hologram” with a childlike nature, have great synergy and are fun to watch. Early on, Clain gets to converse with Phyrne and Nessa, both pairings providing some decent humor. Afterwards, the three come together, and make for some touching moments. Once Phyrne fully joins the picture, she easily becomes one of the better, more complex characters in the series, and once her history starts to surface, I began to feel some sympathy for what she has had to go through. This sympathy only lasts for the middle of the series, but it&#039;s much stronger than some of the deaths that occurred. Though Nessa is childish, she is hardly annoying, and acts as a bit of a connection to the audience, to get them accustomed to the Fractale universe (as generic as it is). Her problems and thought processes are simplistic, but they just work.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are pretty decent too. Notably, Sunda is a pretty cool big brother dude, and Enri, sadly, will be the most annoying character to appear recurrently. The running gag in which she thoroughly believes Clain is nothing but a dirty pervert got old fast and she always seems to be screaming about everything. It&#039;s really hard to find a strong point about her character (except maybe she cares for her henchmen, who resemble the Blues Brothers), and it isn&#039;t until the very final episode where I see her as more than an annoying brat, though by then, the series is already three minutes away from being over. At my most optimistic, I&#039;d say she&#039;s a biproduct of trying too hard to create comedy within the series. It just feels unnatural that only the 13 year old girl makes a huge fuss about accusing ecchi foreigners. The rest of the supporting characters include a few one-shots and Sunda and Enri&#039;s entire family, which adds a nice touch, though I could have lived without. Again, half of them seem to exist only for comedic moments, and without them, the main story could&#039;ve had much more development.<br />
<br />
The antagonists are rather sick, gruesome, Fractalphiles. Several dark implications are made about them, and they&#039;re created in such a manner that you can only wish that they&#039;d die for the sins they&#039;ve committed, which could be considered ironic, considering the Fractale system itself is more or less, a technological religion. Nevertheless, they have nothing but a villainous air about them, with almost no redeeming factors, making the feeling of hate a forced one, just like any good generic RPG “final boss” should make you feel. There&#039;s also a minor side story with one Lost Millennium leader, Dias, who gets pretty antagonistic in the final few episodes, but due to time constraints, he&#039;s developed very little, and you can&#039;t really get accustomed to him being one of the villains in the series. Overall, the main villains are almost nothing but selfish over religious nut jobs. Their breakdowns can get over the top, but they&#039;re frightening and enjoyable to listen to.<br />
<br />
The artwork in Fractale is of decent quality. The backgrounds create an amazing sense of environment, and give the series its much needed sense of adventure, managing to combine both, past, present, and future, with its medieval like villages, and futuristic psuedocities. The art style are reminiscent of Studio Ghibli, which makes the series look somewhat unique in comparison to various moe animes, though the moe aspect still shows a slight bit. Though costumes are fairly simple, they at least aren&#039;t overdone or skankish, for an anime set in the distance future. When animated though, noticeable dips in art quality occur and at times, the characters can appear ugly. Early on, this ugliness is obvious and it won&#039;t be hard to notice whenever characters look sloppily drawn. Sometimes, the characters don&#039;t even appear to fit into the background properly. Luckily, it doesn&#039;t ruin the anime completely and later in the series, the art does get more consistent, in a good sense. Either way, animation is pretty fluid, and it shows that effort was placed into it.<br />
<br />
Sound is another strong point residing within the anime. Voice actors are more than capable of conveying many different emotions, and combined with their personalities, they almost feel like real people. Yuu Kobayashi does a decent boyish Clain, while Kana Hanazawa brings us the moe in the believable little-sister-like Nessa. Tsuda Minami (who&#039;s only other role at the moment of writing this seems to be Kibago from the Pokemon B&amp;W Anime) shows off her talent as Phyrne, and knows how to get mad, sad, pleading, or just happy. The background music is reminiscent, of what you might hear in a fantasy RPG, and though there isn&#039;t any truly memorable track, they fulfill their moods well. Sound effects are spot on and nothing feels out of place.<br />
<br />
Overall, Fractale is a rushed series. Though the characters are likeable and easy to watch, you&#039;ll become impatient, waiting for some sort of action to propel the story forward. When it does arrive though, it just sorta blows over, and doesn&#039;t leave much of an impression on you. If you enjoy quirky, bro-like character interactions with a side of drama, then this shouldn&#039;t be an issue for you, and for an anime based partly off slice-of-life, it&#039;s decent. However, if you came in expecting an adventure series with some great drama, you&#039;ll be left slightly empty. The adventure is there, but it quickly lags behind, unable to catch up. Yamamoto&#039;s promised magnum opus is sadly, only a fraction of what could&#039;ve been a magnificent fractal.

      This was a very pleasant anime. Good for Miyazaki fans and Higashi no Eden fans alike. It&#039;s a pretty &quot;feel good&quot; anime with a typical &quot;let&#039;s work hard as a community for our future&quot; attitude, that is very optimistic of Japanese storytelling; yet it also achieves the ideals of those wanting to rebel against something or fight for something we believe in. <br />
<br />
We are taken through this journey by Clain, a young boy fascinated by &quot;antique&quot; relics such as I-pods or cellular phones. Through his eyes we see the world of Fractale, a computer sim world (not unlike that of Summer Wars) one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47637">
        is born into and whom most follow blindly (as most of the other reviews have pointed out - like a religion). It doesn&#039;t occur to anyone what this system is or how it works or whose pulling the strings, and I suppose that makes sense for most humans. When we&#039;re given a seemingly &#039;good thing&#039; we are not prone to asking where it came from. <br />
<br />
Unlike some of the reviews I read,  I didn&#039;t  feel as the story left me with many unanswered questions. I had a fairly clear understanding what the Fractale system was and why some of the characters were fighting for it. I DO feel there could have been more attention there though, as I was never sure why a bunch of elderly women would choose to protect this system/Phyrne. Was this just maternal instinct or was there more back story there as well?<br />
<br />
The story behind L.M.&#039;s resistance was more clear to me, but I still wished I could have seen when and how the village was developed more. I disagree with most of the reviews on MAL that Enri&#039;s troops and the L.M. died in vain or for no reason, I definitely saw the point. They just wanted the choice to live off the land, naturally and without having to rely on machines or a computer simulation. To them, that was a cause worth fighting over. <br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t say however that the story is totally clear either though. It&#039;s fairly broken and blurred, kind of going in one direction, but not really fully committed to it either. The ethics of the series is also very questionable (see the &quot;you kill people, but you&#039;re my friends too!&quot; quote in the last episodes or any reference to blowing away grannies with machine guns), with no real message to back any of them up except for a half-assed attempt to bring some humanity into the plot later on (&quot;but you have to understand -- they&#039;re EVIL grannies!&quot;).<br />
<br />
 And what is going on with these villains? They&#039;re SOOOO boring (i.e. one dimensional)! I can&#039;t really believe they would inspire so many people to follow them (not the Fractale users, but the other priestesses). It also didn&#039;t help that they could be downright insane at times (giggling to yourself about punishing a fellow priestess is creepy unless your watching hentai - then it makes a morbid kind of sense. But it would still be creepy.<br />
<br />
I think one of the biggest hang-ups in this series for me was the editing work, which can be downright sloppy at times. This is what I attributed most of my &quot;what just happened?&quot; feelings too, as the storyline was pretty linear for me and I usually knew what was going to come next.<br />
<br />
The next biggest weakness for me was Phyrne, who I like despite her ridiculous need to run off into danger every five minutes (which doesn&#039;t connect AT ALL with how we&#039;re introduced to her). She could have been an Utena, a Nadia (who is annoying, but holds her own), she *COULD* have been awesome. Instead they made her awesome for the first episode and insipid for most of the series after that. &quot;I&#039;ll stay here and be protected like a good girl!&quot; ...Just kidding! ... For me, that little tirade got old REAL fast, so unless you&#039;re into that kind of thing she will probably get on your nerves, despite being somehow likable. I blame the cool eye colour.<br />
<br />
The other characters are far more interesting, particularly those in the Granites family (here&#039;s where the Miyazaki comes into play). We don&#039;t see enough of them and honestly I would have been more inclined to give a better score had there been more plot and back story given to their clan/village than the main plot, which is fine but pretty average all things considered. I mean, Tsubasa Chronicles had more going on in one episode than most of this series based on its ability to get me engaged in the episodic plots and villagers involved. <br />
<br />
Another aspect I liked about the characters were their reactions to the situations they were placed in. Like BatOtaku13 mentioned, each reaction feels genuine to me (even Phyrne&#039;s though it gets annoying) and I appreciated that. It isn&#039;t a detail I often find in many anime and I am always pretty impressed when characters are put into high-impact or action scenes and then react with a mode of decorum. <br />
<br />
The best part for me though was the music. I was particularly entranced by OP song &quot;Harinezumi (ハリネズミ)&quot; by Azuma Hitomi which I never once skipped through. It was light and energizing without being another forgettable J-Pop song. The end theme &quot;Down By The Salley Gardens&quot; by Azuma Hitomi was also a refreshing alternative the usual anime sound. It was more of an Irish folk dirge than a pop song and it set the mood to the rest of the anime really well. I am astounded when an anime series looks beyond the box of J-Pop for its music and only a few come to mind (Juuni Kokki, Mushishi, and Origin are my favourite examples). The temple song sounds a little like a typical j-pop song, but it still has a charming note and is nicely developed throughout the series.

    When I began to watch fractale I was delighted because I really like adventure shows. It promised in the first chapters to be a good plot, characteres with logic personality, moral ambiguity, it had a interesant idea to develop and then it is blowing up and crumbling in small pieces. <br />
<br />
Phryne had ten personalities, the developing of the history is completely unstructured jumping months or days, recovering of a bullet shoot in a moment or the personalities changing in one chapter without reason and to finish off that final was ridiculous. <br />
<br />
The art and animation was bad. I could take many screens or a animated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35566">
        gif showing it, however the backgrounds were great in some scenes so it coud pass... The music was average but it was not really touching. About the characters just terrible.<br />
<br />
4/10 for me and if you want to be really nice may be 6/10 no more .

    Well, you usually get to read something about expectations got betrayed and that there is no story behind it, or it&#039;s just a throwaway anime. Well if you think so as well, you don&#039;t need to read on just give it a bad rating and read the next review which pleases your opinion.<br />
<br />
For me, let&#039;s see... Fractale was kind of a surprise, as I had no expectations whatever as it was an anime I got my hands on by coincidence. I just thought the name was interesting nothing more or less. At first I was like: Another Matrix-like future setup? Oh well let&#039;s watch. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65429">
        in the end I got really interested in the Anime. I think a lot depends on how deep you want to read into the show, and if you want to read deeper than it actually is. As it offers quite a lot of material for doing so!<br />
<br />
Never mind the things you don&#039;t know about, as parents everytime eat with their children and care for them... computers ain&#039;t taking over society and our ain&#039;t changing our behaviour, or priorities in life... and of course children won&#039;t ever get violated... Things like that never happen in our modern society! do they? As a matter of fact, Fractale shows us a world where socializing ain&#039;t needed no more, as Mother Goog... I mean Fractale is doing everything for our sake. But what it s real happiness, on what is it build on? There were quite a lot of questions wavering around in my mind and heart while watching that anime. And well usually I am not one to praise something without a reason.<br />
<br />
But well, there are weak points in the story, there are overall flaws in this anime, some are small, some are bigger. But none the less, if you really just want to count them, most of the anime with top ratings right now, would score low, pretty low. But If you can try to imagine, to understand the meaning of scenes, to look behind the mirror and maybe some experience in life is needed as well, then you may come to like Fractale.

    Well, since the first episode of fractale, it caught my interest. for me this is one of the best series for this year 2011 season... a 11 episode of adventure with a calm, quiet and fresh  aura. The vibes of this anime will bring you a feeling of wanting to watch the next episode again.<br />
<br />
This anime will reminds you about MIYAZAKI&#039;s works,. of course with Miyazaki&#039;s vibes.<br />
<br />
<br />
10/10 for the story<br />
it has quite unique story, futuristic yet old. The technology they were using is too far away from us now. They even call &quot;antique&quot; those gadgets that were very popular in our current era. it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35615">
        looks very futuristic, but if you look at the backgrounds and environment, they were lot of uncivilized lands, farms, mountains and grassland.<br />
<br />
10/10 art<br />
well, its not that what you&#039;ve expect to 2011 anime.Its art is unique in its own way and it is one of its asset that you gives the audience the cam and good feeling when watching this.<br />
<br />
9/10 Sound<br />
at first, im not so attract in the ending song, but whenever i watch an episode, i&#039;ve always sing the song with the ending. Then i notice that it was very good.<br />
<br />
9/10 character<br />
The story will be boring if Nessa is not around. Yes, a very lively 10-year old girl called Nessa is giving this series the joy and dont let us audience to be bored  and drop the series.<br />
<br />
of course the enjoyment is in your own, ive enjoy this a lot.<br />
<br />
OVERALL of course 10/10.

    Story:<br />
The first 5 episodes can be easily skipped because there is no advancement in a story. Characters don’t bother to explain anything why something why they are on one side of the group. In episode 3 there was a small progression in the story and that can be explained in one sentence. <br />
<br />
I don’t know if they wanted to create a “mystery” element in this or what but at last I can say it’s executed badly, basically, every faction tries to pull MC to their group without even bothering to explain what is better in their group than other and I think that’s the “mystery”

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275014">
        of series.<br />
<br />
Like why Fractale is bad? What point there is it to lose technical advancement and go back to the “natural” way? What is so bad about “doppels”? When anime starts to explain these things I already felt really bad about this series and didn’t want to watch the next episode (The only reason I watched this series was because MAL Anime Challenge, under normal situations I would stop watching this series around episode 5 because it was just so painful). <br />
<br />
So basically half of the series is just that characters won’t explain even the smallest things about what’s going on in that world. Well, I can’t say it was all bad, there were few nice events that make it so I bothered to watch till the end.<br />
<br />
The story was at best 5 and can’t recommend this to many people. Most of my friends (also for me) story is number 1 thing in anime and this series biggest shortcoming was story or characters.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Is the strongest part of this series. The art was really good and pleasing to watch. There was nice use in colors, not too strong or popping. Some scenes seemed to be “watered down” but 99% was well done in this series. There wasn’t anything “new” or “exceptional” in this but it was good quality (and no 3D, at last too much).<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound wasn’t anything special in this series. Truth to be told there wasn’t any song that I remember anymore (OP &amp; EP excluded). The sound effects were quite good and I not even once thought “what a heck sound was that”. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The worst or second worst thing in this series. Usually, I think the story and characters as the same. But mostly the story was bad because Characters can’t speak, they don’t explain anything. There were quite interesting characters mixed but mostly they felt bad. In the first episode I started already hate Clain, he didn’t even try to understand other people. Well, other people weren’t that much better as I explained in the story. They force their thoughts on Clain without explaining anything. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I think most can guess what here will be, well to be honest you’re right, I hate this series. But there were also some hidden nice times. But still, if I could (or even bother) it would be nice to get this time back (luckily I watched this series the same time I did other things).<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Some nice gems surrounded by boring stories. Overall this series gets 4, no worse or better. I was disappointed how bad this was, I wasn’t expecting new masterwork but even a little bit of something that would have made this better. Have to say even Gilgamesh is better than this.

    Oy voy, this series was unsure what to make of itself. At first glance, I thought the show was gonna try making itself into a walking homage to Ghibli titles considering the nods to Nausicaa and Laputa in the show&#039;s first episode with the opening music and Phyrne&#039;s air chase scene. Also tossed into the mix was the appearance of augmented reality with Claine&#039;s interactions with the virtual beings known as vectors. There was even a point where I thought the show was gonna degenerate into some sort of harem comedy thanks to Nessa&#039;s appearance and the antics of Enri.<br />
<br />
After a few episodes though, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37260">
        came to realize that the show was gearing itself to be an adventure title with the conflict between the Temple and Lost Millennium rebels once a darker side to the Fractale System is brought up. A number of elements of the Fractale System did offer some decent exploration of the benefits and flaws to human dependence on technology as while it offered great advances in the information and resources it could provide humans, it does bring about disconnection over interaction with people beyond a vector or computer screen as Claine comes to realize when Phyrne&#039;s appearance makes him wonder why he can&#039;t meet his parents in person. In addition, there is always the human control element to such technology where a group of individuals try to control the technology however they see fit, which occurs in the form of the Temple who use the Fractale System to brainwash anyone with doubts or questions over the lifestyle Fractale provides them.<br />
<br />
Fractale was the best series for me to see for the Winter 2011 season for its overall visual presentation. The series sports clean and detailed scenery and character designs as there was enough gorgeous designs of the holographic cities within the Fractale System and the mundane villages that those within both Fractale and Lost Millennium lived in. Battle scenes were quite fluid as well with well-animated movement of people and airships between the Temple and Lost Millennium as the two sides engaged one another in conflict.<br />
<br />
However, Fractale had quite a number of flaws I took notice of that killed its quality for me. What proves to be the biggest weakness of Fractale for me is a number of the typical anime cliches to be found in anime that detract from the series to be too different from other anime titles. The show occasionally makes Claine into an accidental pervert a la romantic comedies like Love Hina and Chobits, for some cheap laughs. The Temple is made to be as shallowly evil as possible. Speaking of said latter cliche, there isn&#039;t much fleshing out provided on members of the Lost Millennium faction as well and often we see members committing to not so noble causes like enslaving or killing civilians within the Fractale System. This makes it so that beyond what we learn of Claine, Nessa and Phyrne, you could care less about the war going on between the Temple and Lost Millennium thanks to how shallow both factions are. And I also found the ending of the series to be a bit of a cop-out due to the lack of foreshadowing over what is shown regarding the true nature of the Fractale System.<br />
<br />
Fractale proved itself to be quite the mixed bag of an anime for me in this season and at times, feeling like it was a mess. While sporting the best visuals I&#039;ve seen for the Winter 2011 anime season and having some interesting subjects to point out with the relationship between man and technology, the series is bogged down by its conventional anime elements and the lack of depth on the two major factions that were in conflict with one another throughout the series. Fractale proved to be one of the weaker entries I&#039;ve seen come out of the Noitamina anime lineup.

    When I began to watch the first episode I had no clue as to what I should expect from Fractale.  When I started I was willing to give it a chance, and I actually became fully interested by the end of the first episode when a decent plot started to form.  By the time I came to the end of the series, however, I was sorely disappointed in the lack of story.<br />
<br />
The story for Fractale started out so well but by the 3rd episode the story becomes so fragmented.  It felt too much like the writers could not decide on which story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41669">
        path to pursue so they just went with whatever they felt like at the time.  As if they put all their ideas up on a wall, and then threw darts at it to see what ideas the darts landed on.  In short for the story, many elements that should be explained are not, but we have to stumble around in confusion as to why they are important.  As further insult to injury parts of the story that really are not very important are concentrated on too hard.  You can pretty much toss two or three episodes worth of content into the dumpster, it serves no other purpose.  On this same point you have some really interesting characters, but they are not as interesting as they should be because of poor story writing.<br />
<br />
I will give credit to the voice actors, and the people who did the music.  The actors did a great job bringing out their characters despite the poor story.  The music does really set the mood fantastically too.  I thought the artwork was very good as well, and it did create this very beautiful world.  That is if you don&#039;t count the majority of the &quot;Dopples&quot;.  I thought someone was on drugs when they were drawing those things, they were just too goofy looking to take seriously.  It was a relief to see believable, human looking dopples, but then again it&#039;s hard to be worse than water-cooler dad, and pink lampshade mom.<br />
<br />
All in all Fractale did have the potential to be really good, but the poor story telling only serves to be a hindrance, and brings down the rest of the elements.  This probably would have been better as a three, or four part OVA.  For an eleven episode series it&#039;s not bad if you are not really watching anything else at the time, but you can otherwise pass on this one.

    I initially started watching Fractale because the artwork attracted me. It seemed to be of high quality, and the characters appeared like they&#039;d be fun and full of depth. Well, after having watched the show, those initial assumptions were far too optimistic. Unfortunately, what starts off as an interesting and intimate story about a boy, Clain, living in an intriguing environment quickly devolves into a scatter-brained comedy, then a brutal, shallow commentary on personal freedom, and then it just kinda...peters off into this ill-thought hodge-podge of half-baked ideas that are just barely touched-upon and then completely bypassed. So, let&#039;s look at where it goes wrong

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35917">
        in a bit more depth.<br />
<br />
**Warning: This review may contain mild spoilers. I&#039;ll try to keep the major ones out, but just a heads up!**<br />
<br />
~Story~<br />
<br />
And here we have our biggest issue. In the first few episodes, we&#039;re introduced to this futuristic society not unlike The Matrix, only these people are fully aware that they are living in a fantasy world. Essentially, the idea is that people exist inside a broader Utopian internet with personal avatars, called doppels, representing them in this pseudo-reality. However, what&#039;s immediately interesting as we find with our main character, Clain, is that not everyone uses a doppel. Clain, while he also exists in this fake Utopian world, doesn&#039;t use a false image to live through. He just wanders around as himself, going about this day-to-day life. His parents and pet dog, on the other hand, use doppels to interact with him, so they aren&#039;t really there. (Why a dog has a doppel, I&#039;m not entirely sure. In fact, I&#039;m not certain if the dog is a complete fabrication...the series never really discusses this.) This sets up an interesting issue dealing with how humanity no longer needs to really interact, even families don&#039;t actually live together anymore. Sadly, though this theme is presented early on, it&#039;s never really explored in-depth and ends up feeling like a side-note to the story. Sure, the series toys with the notion of people being friends, and ends up shallowly exploring the value of family through the relationships among the main three characters, but it never seriously looks at why a close family is desirable. And as you continue to watch the series, you&#039;ll come to realize that&#039;s the main problem: Ideas are presented, but no actual outcomes of a given behavior are ever really explored. Clain is obviously somewhat lonely, but it doesn&#039;t seem to affect him too badly. Family seems to be important, but why? The positives and negatives are never really expressed.<br />
<br />
In any event, Clain&#039;s life changes the day he meets Phryne, a priestess from the temple that oversees the Fractale System (the system allowing the fake Utopian internet). It&#039;s soon discovered that the temple is not what it seems, and that there are rebels fighting to destroy the Fractale System. Why? Well, the series does show and hedge at the temple brain-washing people, so that they don&#039;t ever question whether a family should live together or not, but that&#039;s about it. Yeah, brain-washing is bad, but you never get the sense of why this is really evil. The System does create a Utopia, after all. <br />
<br />
And just why do the rebels think this is so wrong? Allegedly because it makes people dependent on the system. They can&#039;t live without it...sooo...that&#039;s total reason to gun down the old women of the temple and force other people to be free. No joke, the rebels actually shoot up old women. To be fair, the old ladies fight back and take some of the rebels down, but really, if you&#039;re trying to gain sympathy for your side, I&#039;m not thinking filling the symbol for milk and cookies full of lead is a good way to go about it. And after the rebels do this, Clain recognizes that they are murders and doesn&#039;t necessarily like them, which is awesome and makes him not your typical anime boy...buuuut, sadly, Clain just later sorta dismisses this fact because these people become his friends. So what would have been a really interesting, deep personal dilemma (Should Clain really stand behind these people, even if they are actual terrorists?) turns into another run-of-the-mill &quot;FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE OVERCOME ALL&quot; anime band-aid. It also cheapens the initial scenario when another faction of the rebels turns out to be less moral and more harsh than the original party. So, really, remember this terrorists: It&#039;s okay just as long as there are bigger jerks out there. You&#039;ll seem angelic in comparison, which means you must not be all that bad. <br />
<br />
The saddest thing is, by the end of the anime, the more evil faction, led by a character named Dias, actually seems a whole heck of a lot more logical to me. Sure, when he fist shows up, he and his group are malicious and cut-throat, but the actions they take in the end just make more sense. By that point, it&#039;s all out war, and the commands he makes are more strategic to his side winning with the fewest casualties. We&#039;re supposed to feel like he and his are still mostly evil, but that&#039;s just because they suggest killing some characters we&#039;ve come to love, even though they are absolutely correct in that killing said characters would satisfactorily allow their side to reach their goals with a minimal fatality count. So I&#039;m left feeling like the &quot;good&quot; side are a bunch of selfish morons, rather than that they are doing the right thing. After all, they&#039;re STILL gunning down grannies in the end, regardless, so really, at that point, shouldn&#039;t you be trying to end things to save the most people you can on your side?<br />
<br />
I could go on and on about the story problems, so let me just conclude that the story creates many intriguing threads, but none of those threads is fully explored, explained, or evolved into anything meaningful. You get the idea behind several story concpets in that you can tell what the creators were going for, but they never actually show you what they meant to make you see. This counts for both emotional aspects of the story and logical ones. For example, we&#039;re never outright told why there are all these old ladies in the temple. We&#039;re given certain background information to infer why that&#039;s so, but they never actually tell you if that intuition is correct. <br />
<br />
Also, I&#039;m telling you upfront so you don&#039;t sit and wait and wait to figure this out: No, they will never tell you how the system actually came to be or how it works. Sad, considering the whole premise becomes finding the &quot;key&quot; that will allow the system to keep working. Well, they do find the key, but they NEVER explain why that key works or what it really does (they say why this particular key works, but not what the actual function of a key is). It&#039;s pretty frustrating, actually. <br />
<br />
~Art~<br />
<br />
The art is pretty fluid and nice, I feel. There are some inconsistencies, but it looks pretty good overall. There&#039;s one episode in particular featuring an area known as Xanadu that is especially well-done. Xanadu is a very rich environment, and it&#039;s apparent that great skill and time went into making the backgrounds there stand out. A lot of people have commented on how nice the backgrounds are overall. I think aside form Xanadu that they&#039;re nice, but nothing overly special or innovative. Pleasant, but nothing that makes us feel that that world is really special. <br />
<br />
~Sound~<br />
<br />
The opening theme from a sound perspective is nothing too special. Easy to overlook. The reason you&#039;d watch that is for the visuals, as they actually spliced together some fun footage of actual math fractals. The ending theme rocks in that it&#039;s a poem by William Butler Yeats (LOVE Yeats). Very pretty and enjoyable to listen to, though there&#039;s nothing really to look at in the end animation. Just Nessa, one of the characters, sitting on a rock in the wind. Fits the song&#039;s sound, I suppose, but not inherently interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also another song within the show that keeps popping up. I very much like that song, which is good in that it did appear quite often. They never sing it all the way through, I don&#039;t think, but one line of it is repeated several times by various characters.<br />
<br />
The voice acting and all else to do with sound was fine. Nessa&#039;s voice actress did a fabulous job, helping to make her character truly enjoyable. Everyone else either fit and did a fine job (though it didn&#039;t stand out as spectacular), or they were just not terrible enough to note. <br />
<br />
~Character~<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s another big problem. Personally, I HATED Clain. He&#039;s fine and interesting in the first few episodes, but he becomes very one-note and whiny as time progresses. It&#039;s like he was told &quot;Your job is to be disgruntled and horribly possessive of Phryne, go.&quot; He does have an interesting quirk in that he loves &quot;old&quot; technology (modern tech to us is what they consider old), but that caveat ends up having absolutely no bearing on the plot, so it&#039;s kind of like, &quot;Why do you keep reminding us constantly that he likes antiques? So what? He never uses that skill to do anything or make a point about the theme.&quot; I guess it was supposed to highlight a nostalgia for the &quot;old&quot; ways and show why they were more intimate and beneficial to humanity, but here again is an idea that&#039;s not really followed up on and that we&#039;re left to infer. <br />
<br />
Phryne is a fine enough character, but the show decides to incorporate a dark trauma into her past that also has NO POINT. She never acts traumatized, not really, and the revelation of this dark event has virtually no impact on changing her character, nor those of anyone else around her. But every good lead needs some angst, right? Riiiiiiiiiiight? It also bugged the heck out of me that she kept getting called a tomboy simply because she actually GASP saves herself and doesn&#039;t care so much about taking off her clothes (not that she ever does this without good reason. There are only two times she gets fully nude and once is because she needs help cleaning a wound while the other is that she&#039;s swimming). <br />
<br />
Nessa is sweet and charming and undeniably the main reason most people who end up liking the show do. She&#039;s fun and energetic without being too annoying, and acts fairly realistically for an overly joyful 10-year-old. However, her character does seem to only serve that convenient anime purpose of reminding us all that love is key, and we should like each other, and blah blah LOVE! blah blah. <br />
<br />
Grandmother Granite is a very enjoyable character who serves as a point of thematic contention in that she likes Nessa (a doppel, hence a product of the &quot;evil&quot; temple), but she still fights on the side of the rebels. That characteristic raises some interesting points about old world ideals versus new, and the blending possible therein. Unfortunately, she leaves the series early and disappears into the background, becoming yet another instance of a potentially thought-provoking notion being shoved to the side. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the three most inherently interesting characters who had HUGE potential to really make us question the morals and themes of the show are given very, very little attention. These characters are Dias, the temple&#039;s arch priestess, and a person living in Xanadu. Dias is interesting as he&#039;s the more cut-throat, but LOGICAL of the rebels and serves as a foil to Sunda, the leader of the group we&#039;re meant to end up liking. But as Dias is not very developed, they miss out on a great opportunity to actually take advantage of that foil dynamic. Oh well. Similarly, the arch priestess at the end becomes somewhat of a foil for Phryne, and actually evidently has much more depth and intriguing background, but we never get to see it. Another hugely missed opportunity. The man in Xanadu is missed chance to deepen the themes of the show as he seems to be the one strong argument for why taking people out of the Fractale System is potentially quite terrible (he is horribly physically impaired, so he can only function normally inside the system using a doppel). But this character literally vanishes from the story. We never know what happens to him or even who he really was. <br />
<br />
Like the story of the show, the characters are half-hearted at best and ill-conceived. <br />
<br />
~Overall~<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this show is a pretty big disappointment. It has the pieces to something greater, but it never follows through. And it&#039;s humor is terribly contrived. For example, a character ends up cross-dressing, but the reason for why is incredibly weak and illogical, so it&#039;s just an excuse to be silly at a point in the show when it&#039;s trying to get you to take the fighting seriously. As many have noted, the constant gag of calling Clain a pervert is irritating. So I certainly can&#039;t recommend this show based on story or humor. Further, more episodes wouldn&#039;t help save it as the show can&#039;t even pin down one character or story idea well. It&#039;s just full of terrible writing all around, and that can&#039;t be fixed with quantity. <br />
<br />
From what I can gather, there are two types of people who will like this show:<br />
<br />
1) You are a person who doesn&#039;t care so much about plot as you do about the main relationship between the characters. Everything else can be overlooked as long as you like those characters and are happy with their ending. If you&#039;re in this camp, watch until you meet Nessa, Phryne, and Clain. If you very much like all those three, then I think you&#039;ll be fine and end up enjoying the show. If you don&#039;t like one of those three, I&#039;m not sure liking one or both of the other two a lot is going to be enough to save the show. You may still enjoy the show for one of the three, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll leave it thinking it was a good overall unless you like all of them. <br />
<br />
2) You like a good explosion of hectic fighting and mayhem at the end of your show. If you&#039;re in this camp, and you can overlook weak characters and shallow plot, then you may still like the ending. There&#039;s plenty of fighting and chaos to be had (though it&#039;s nothing as grand or overly graphic as certain other animes. It doesn&#039;t glorify in the gore and torture). Sadly for you, you&#039;ll have to watch several boring episodes to get to that end. So if you can bear to watch that far, you may still leave contented. Or you could always just skip to the end. Really, they never explain much, so if you don&#039;t care about the characters, you&#039;d not be missing a lot. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, I&#039;d say pass this one up. There are many other wonderful animes out there that tread similar themes. The difference being that those other animes fully explore said themes and do them, and their characters, justice. <br />

    This fools people. The potential it had, yet unused. Unused to stop the cliche-ness? Well, stories need it at some point; there&#039;s a reason why it&#039;s *popular* and why it&#039;s called &#039;cliche.&#039;<br />
<br />
Story (6) – Art (8) – Sound (7) – Character (6) – Enjoyment (8) – Overall (7)<br />
<br />
FRACTALE seemed so different from looking at banners – simple, looks like movie quality, but what seemed to be ‘so promising’ and ‘so epic’ was so bad, just so disappointing! Of course, I already knew that producers would eventually put a façade on almost everything they do, but hey, you just got to admit it, the banner really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36045">
        did have the attractive simplicity and the characters had life in it. Hoo~ I really did fall for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
<br />
The first episode didn’t seem to give a really big impact. It gave me the feeling that I could just skip it off – mark it off from my mind. There wasn’t much ‘drama’ or so in the first meeting (or at least how I remember it to be; doesn’t seem memorable). [...]<br />
<br />
Watch, watch, watch. And yeah, I didn’t have much feelings watching the show. It just passed by. It made me feel like it is only for killing time. Yes, the drama was nice, the slice-of-life was fine, the action was good, but that’s that – nothing more, nothing less. There were a lot of things that I felt that was missing, but apparently, it isn’t just me. There are a lot from different anime bloggers.<br />
<br />
What felt to be climatic didn’t feel much at all. I could feel a bit of its tense, but none of its atmosphere. I wasn’t absorbed in the anime. To put it bluntly, it is pretty much a mediocre anime. In fact, more than half of the the important events in the anime have… well, no significance, in the end. (Were there even really important events to take note of?).<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
I would say it was good but it makes me pull this show down because of the story it has made. I would say that art is between outstanding and great, but there are some times where the art could be, err, well… pretty hard to understand – something that could be misinterpreted.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Some/Most people would say it’s great (probably), but the song isn’t really to my liking especially the ending sequence. I don’t really know what would actually make me dislike the ending sequence, but I guess that’s because it isn’t as fitting to the anime as it seems to other people. The opening sequence was fine, but I actually got tired of it and thought that it is bad (or has gotten bad). Just listen to it for yourself.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
<br />
All I can say is that the character development is below average, but I couldn’t say it was that bad. It’s almost been the same thing, from the first episode to the last one.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
When I get disappointed, I make this-is-fine things bad, but not as how I make it out to be. But seriously, to be honest, I really did enjoy watching this show. I couldn’t say I was wasting my time, but there were some things I learned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
I have to admit, even cliché stories are better than this – WAY BETTER – than this. . . .<br />
<br />
But still, it’s *kind of* worth the watch.<br />
<br />

    The anime that killed Yamakan&#039;s career...until he started directing again...the freaking liar.<br />
<br />
Fractale was something of pet project for Yamakan and it really does show in some aspect of this anime and say what you will for Yamakan as a person (mainly his obnoxiousness and director meddling causing scandals left right and center), but his directing skills does have merit, Yamakan does a good job in fleshing out his worlds and bringing in the stakes of the plot. Buuuut...<br />
<br />
See Fractale is one of those animes where LA sees a solid concept and plot, but several things bogs down the anime to mediocre status.<br />
<br />
The world building of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306263">
        Fractale is one of it&#039;s strongest aspects of the anime, as we look at a technologically advanced world, but where the insurgence *ahem* resistance compels them to look away from technology and be &quot;more human&quot;. In a sense this anime ahead of it&#039;s time, hell if it was released NOW when LA writes this review, the impact would had been there to a certain extent (besides the obvious humans are relying too much on technology).<br />
<br />
But in comes one of the problems towards this anime, that of it&#039;s juvenile humor that it&#039;s characters are inflected with, not to mention the character themselves ALSO being problems in their won right. The juvenile humor and there&#039;s like ONE running gag that gets extremely annoying, that of the main protagonist Clain voiced by Yuu Kobayashi constantly being called a pervert, you know THAT old chestnut and yes he gets into wacky shenanigans with that gag.<br />
<br />
So the characters, they all have some redeemed qualities about them, but the only three that really matter are, Clain, Nessa voiced by Kana Hanazawa and Phyrne voiced by Minami Tsuda, but all of them have something that irked LA to the point of not wanting to care about them, personally, plot wise, Clain, Nessa and Phyrne drives the plot or get themselves into situations that matter to them, but in terms character well, Clain is the dense main male protagonist and is ignorant of the situation he got himself in for the majority of the anime but he gets better and again his running gag being his only comedic stint doesn&#039;t really help his character, Nessa is the genki character through and through and usually LA likes these archetypes...but her genkiness did get a bit much at times and on the other side of the fence is Phyrne is the typical tsundere, LA WANTED to like her to be LA&#039;s favourite but her behaviour to almost everyone got irritating at times. The minor cast are no different to be honest, like Enri Granitz voiced by Yuka Iguchi, one of the resistance members and she gains a small crush on Clain but for the majority of the anime, she sticks to her &quot;pervert Clain&quot; persona, Sunda voiced by Shintaro Asanuma likes being an asshole to Clain but warms up to him and finally Barrot voiced by Misuru Miyamoto being one of the villains of this anime...is a complete monster and LA wished he die in a fire. <br />
<br />
The animation done by A1-Pictures and Ordet was...ok to a certain level, like the character designs weren&#039;t that bad though the animation quality tend to dip whether be it intentionally or not. But the animation lied in it&#039;s background and action work and to be honest it did a pretty good job on that front. To this end, LA WOULD have seen the animation quality similar to the anime poster given and the obvious animation quality dips accounts for that want, but nonetheless character designs and derps aside...an ok animation production.<br />
<br />
Voice work, well at least LA will say as annoying as the nearly the entire cast of characters were, their voice actor counterparts at least felt like they gave it their all. From Minami Tsuda as Phyrne, Kana Hanazawa as Nessa, Yuka Iguchi as Enri and heck LA will give Yuu Kobayashi as Clain some slack as Yuu did a good cross dressing role as Clain.<br />
<br />
The plot twist towards this anime was actually great as well, like LA said, the plot and concept was well intertwined and developed alongside the plot twists that were to come and the plot twists mainly does concern Nessa and Phyrne, but even Clain gradually experiencing his whole world has been shattered as well as his world beliefs on technology being tested constantly that kickstarted the anime was decent build up to the plot twists ahead, heck even the smaller details this anime gives were charming in it&#039;s execution in many ways.<br />
<br />
As action packed, plot twisted (that made sense) as the final few episodes gave us, the end result was.....kinda anti-climactic as the finale was all culminating to the final decision that could change Clain&#039;s entire world if it could, as LA said Yamakan can build suspense and raise the stakes in his plot well and this was one of them...too bad the finale for LA at least anti-climactic. LA was more interested on one snippet of information that might give off a meta-sense, almost like the anime was saying it was in a computer itself by what it was going at, but too bad the ending dashed all that away and gave us a VERY safe finale.<br />
<br />
Fractale is an interesting anime, with a solid concept and plot, it&#039;s too bad it&#039;s lackluster and sometimes annoying cast of characters, derpy animation, it&#039;s anti-climactic finale and it&#039;s juvenile humor crippled LA&#039;s experience, but that&#039;s still not to say LA enjoyed the anime as LA did, but man LA was expecting ALOT more considering the buildup this anime gave was going places but felt like it gave up near the finale.<br />
<br />
Yamakan may be one hell of a controversial anime director, but LA will say that his directorial skills does have some level of polish and it DOES certainly show in Fractale it&#039;s too bad however that Fractale can be summed up in two words...<br />
<br />
WASTED POTENTIAL.

    Almost always when an anime has really, really good or really, really poor scores on this site and then I watch it I can at least understand why people feel that way, even if it does not match my personal opinion. This was not one of those cases. This anime has some pretty awful reviews and I really don&#039;t understand why. It&#039;s not amazing by any means, but I really and truly do not understand what is so bad about it. I thought by and large it did basically everything somewhere between decently and well, even if it wasn&#039;t amazing at anything, but it certainly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318892">
        didn&#039;t feel like it was terrible at anything either.<br />
<br />
For only 11 episodes, a very short ride, it does a pretty reasonable job with character development, including even secondary characters to a degree. I found the animation style charming and it reminded me a bit of a Ghibli film. I thought the voice acting in the dub was consistently solid, as I have an extremely high opinion of both Brina Palencia and Luci Christian as an in general, and I thought the background music stood out in a good way a number of times.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe with the anime is lack of clarity. I felt like the ending explained things well enough to where I MOSTLY get it, but it probably could have been a bit more clear. I think perhaps an episode count in the vicinity of 14 would have been ideal, but it didn&#039;t feel rushed at any point except for maybe at the very end. I also never felt wowed at any point. The anime was consistently good throughout but I was waiting for that one moment, whether it was the jaw dropping plot twist, the heart wrenching tragic moment, the awe inspiring gorgeous moment or the simply awesome action scene, to command my attention and be the definitive, memorable moment of the anime and it simply never came. That doesn&#039;t mean I didn&#039;t enjoy what I did see though.<br />
<br />
All in all I disagree with the consensus on this one and think this is a pleasant, no filler, lighthearted sci-fi journey worth taking. Not an all time great or something you can&#039;t afford to miss, but way better than the unjust 3/4/5 reviews others are flinging around. Check it out if you&#039;re a fan of the genre.<br />
