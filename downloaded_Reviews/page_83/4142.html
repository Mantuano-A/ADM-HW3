    I have seen plenty of Josei anime to the point I can surely say what makes it quite distinguishing from other genre is that most of the time, it consisting characters driven story and has high attention to the realism. Servamp caught my interest because it happens to fallen to be one of the genres and it ended up to be exceptional. Exceptional that it is so badly done that ends up being counterproductive.<br />
<br />
The story of Servamp follows Mahiru... actually; the main story is pretty much covered in the synopsis, so there isn&#039;t much reason for me to regurgitate the same thing in different words.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230270">
        Long story short, Servamp is really something we’ve seen hundreds of times before; ordinary high school boy meets weird stuff (in this case black cats) and gets caught in a live or die situation with all convenient we’ve come to expect of such story. <br />
<br />
Now, in all respect there’s nothing wrong with a premise that is lack of originality. But servamp just feel…. quite empty. The plot is just something you encounter in battle shounen series; if you’re looking for in-depth plot then look further because the show doesn’t had any. Everything in the plot is pretty clear black and white, the bad guy is obvious and the good guy is always on the side good guys. The first few episodes are generally geared towards comedy with little real progression. The actual comedy isn&#039;t too bad and some moments are fairly funny, but hit or miss jokes aren&#039;t enough to make something entertaining. The series then shifts to more of a battle shounen with action, however, the action isn’t that much interesting and feels rushed because most of the time it ended with always ends with one slash. I’d also like to mention the tone is pretty I don’t know… not appropriate? because the show explained that the bad vampires is a creature that kills human, yet everything is feel so mundane and light, there no sense of urgency; it is as if the show doesn’t take the whole the matters seriously.<br />
<br />
The characters well... we get to see the major protagonist and the major villain gets a backstory (which is all sad/ tragic story by the way) but somehow it wasn’t full enough to make us sympathize with them. The supporting is even worse, because they don’t even have time due to the short length. One of the prime example is Misono, on which his dreams is to protect people, but it never be explained why he do so considering he looks like some rich boy who doesn’t care with anyone.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, due to the short length, many of the questions raised are left unanswered, coupled with an unsatisfying conclusion (not that it concludes anything), which ends just as it seems the real story is about to begin; it told the viewers there are seven servamp based of seven sins yet at the end of the series there are only five present and the ending was cop out and feels like Disney’s ending. <br />
<br />
Then there is the art, which is certainly Servamp best area. But even then, it is not above series in at least 2 years back. There are a wide range of colors used for all of the characters, which is nice but it the background are just present I guess. The animation quality is decent. There are a few instances where they turn it up a notch, but this is mostly for action scenes, which rarely last more than two minutes. all in all it is competent to today standard.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was okay. The opening were all right and suited the series but were also pretty generic themes. The opening theme was slightly better as it set up the episodes quite well, and the visuals associated with it were actually relevant to the story of the anime. The rest of the soundtrack, while not being anything noteworthy, matched the mood of the scenes and worded well overall. However, I found the ED to be terrible, but that’s more like luxury than actual criticism.<br />
<br />
Servamp is a pretty underwhelming action/comedy series The early couple of episodes maybe mildly entertaining, but as a whole the series is quite frustrating, due to a lack of any real closure. We’re introduced to an extensive cast, but many of them lacked a decent back story. Mahiru, being the main character, wasn&#039;t particularly interesting, but the side characters were, even if most were given very little time to shine. It&#039;s in the middle episodes, where it feels very rushed, that most of the enjoyment is lost. The production values are solid, but nothing to blow anyone away. I would also like to mention, that if you are expecting to see traditional vampires, then you will be generally disappointed. <br />
<br />
A forgotten series and probably one of few Josei series that I personally found bad.<br />

    This anime is takes itself too seriously by trying to be &#039;deep&#039; on the premise of &#039;friendship&#039;. It fails horribly and characters act irrational on a basis such as &quot;you called me a friend&quot;. The characters themselves come off as bland and again try to be deep with their single layered backstory or motives which just makes it even more laughable. After four episodes out of twelve I couldn&#039;t even remember what the plot was and I didn&#039;t even care because it seemed like they didn&#039;t even care themselves. If you like staring at your screen as long as theres something moving then you could

    I&#039;ve currently watched all 4 episodes of this anime so far. Rating on those aired 4 episodes, i think the story is very interesting. This anime isn&#039;t focused on a tragedy or a romance anime, but it still made me shed tears near the end of the 4th episode. Therefore, for story i give it an 9. It meets my requirements and i genuinely enjoy animes that can make me emotionally unstable because it just shows how much attention i&#039;m giving the anime.<br />
<br />
For the art, it looks rather basic. Lol im kidding, i think the art is cute. Kuro&#039;s fashion makes me think moe, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225189">
        uh that&#039;s not the point. The art is exceeds my average standards. Leading my rating for it, another 9.<br />
<br />
For sound wise, i&#039;m not sure if i enjoyed it too much. The voice actors were incredible however, as always. The opening did match the the of the anime so although the beat wasn&#039;t quite my taste, I did understand. Sound gets an 7.<br />
<br />
To be honest, the characters in the anime were the main part it was so interesting. Kuro&#039;s lazy personality really helped lighten the anime and made it easier for the watcher to consume. The story in general about vampires isn&#039;t realistic but the MC displays realistic human emotion which helps the person watching relate a little. The supporting characters made me feel like they were really needed to bring the story up as they did their job well. Sometimes in animes, the supporters don&#039;t do the job well which make watchers think that they&#039;re not needed in general. With these details included, this section scores yet another 9.<br />
<br />
Finally the enjoyment, this may just be personal because everyone has their own enjoyment level on different animes, but mine was a 10. This anime led me on with plot development and suspense. I couldn&#039;t wait for the next episode and when i realised i had finished watching all the currently aired ones, i was rather devastated.<br />
<br />
Overall this anime scores a whooping 9. I suggest you try out this anime if you have nothing better to do or you&#039;re looking for an anime to really make you excited.<br />
<br />
This concludes my review.

    The top rated review for this being a &#039;3&#039; seems very exaggerated. An anime that is rated a &#039;3&#039; lacks not only in story, but also art, sound and character. Here&#039;s why that is not true:<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
This is a setting that many have seen before. Normal High School student is met with the supernatural and pulled into a whole different world. So far, it doesn&#039;t seem like there is anything too amazing about it. However, I have not yet encountered a story in which said supernatural creature is literally THE most lazy person in the show, which often helps loosen the &#039;deep&#039; mood that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231577">
        story is going for with an amusing comment about how he&#039;d rather take a nap than do anything &#039;bothersome&#039;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The animation is great, and the character design is a very favorite of mine. Bright colors, distinctive character designs so that you don&#039;t get confused about who is who - nothing to complain about here.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
I really love the opening by Oldcodex that suits the anime&#039;s darker theme, but also the ending that gives you a more upbeat and happy-go-lucky feeling if there has been a particularly &#039;dark&#039; episode.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
The main character is your everyday hero who wants to protect his friends and do everything right, which comes across as a bit generic at times. What really pulled me in was Kuro, the second main character, who (while being one of the laziest people on Earth) still manages to be powerful when needed, and also funny at times.<br />
<br />
A few episodes in is when the character development of Kuro starts to happen, when you start getting a deeper look into what has happened in his past.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
I really cannot say I disliked watching any of these episodes. I&#039;m always looking forward to the next one, and can&#039;t say that I felt like I wasted time with any of the episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
If you&#039;re someone who enjoys an anime with a pretty art style and bright colors, an anime that is somehow &#039;deep&#039; but still manages to bring in funny and amusing scenes (sometimes when you least expect it), then I highly recommend this to you.

    At first I just brush off this anime like those typical shounen, blah, plain MC ect. But somewhere through the 3rd and 4th episode, Mahiru grew on me. Not because he is anything special but the way he thinks. I can&#039;t deny that Mahiru&#039;s words are gonna stick with me the rest of my life. No matter when or where, there is always people hoping that &#039;someone&#039; would come and because that &#039;someone&#039; would definitely appear, the world keeps going. It isn&#039;t gonna be just him or just Kuro but it will be them.<br />
<br />
If it&#039;s Kuro&#039;s problem, Mahiru has to be there, there isn&#039;t anything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229633">
        to be faced alone. The problem might be Kuro&#039;s but Mahiru is his eve, his partner and his &#039;reason&#039;. (as Mikuni had said) And seriously, despite everything, do you guys really want this to be &#039;oh I stab the antagonist, he ded, the end&#039; is that kind of ending what you want? I think the ending was quite nice and peaceful and it wasn&#039;t unpleasant. It was a nice change. I don&#039;t need to see blood flying everywhere and people dying to call it a GREAT VICTORY! =_=<br />
<br />
Licht, Lawless, Kuro, Mahiru, Tsubaki and Sakuya are really interesting characters and even though the anime did not best in showing off characters such as the Pride pair and Lust pair, C3 as such, it did made some great show out of the more standing out ones. I enjoy the Greed pair the most (no surprise)<br />
<br />
I guess one of the reason I liked this anime is because there are a lot of angst going on in some anime now *COUGHDANGANRONPACOUGH* and not only that, because people now a-days just keeps spamming horror/angst/negative emotions. I really like how this anime turns out despite it&#039;s various flaw.

    Looking for a series that constantly likes to add characters and ideas, then let it all pile up and do nothing with them? If that’s the case, then “Servamp” is right up your ally.<br />
<br />
To make things clear, I do not mind the ideas the show has to offer. I found the concept of Servamps and Eves to be quite interesting. The problem I had with it was how everything was presented. Each episode gave us new subplots after another where eventually we have a bunch of things happening at the same time with almost no conclusion. It then makes me question what the main plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229671">
        is because when something new happens, that suddenly takes priority. By the time the series finished, many things were left discarded and unanswered.<br />
<br />
Similar to the plot, the characters never go anywhere in terms of personality. They just appear and decide to be involved in the conflict like it was nothing. The main characters have zero presence and don’t even feel like main characters. I had a hard time figuring out who the actual antagonist was or if there even was one. It’s not an exaggeration when I say that we get two of more characters introduced each episode. We’re overwhelmed with all of these people who have little to no presence. There is one thing I would like to mention. Each of the Servamps represent one of the seven deadly sins, and two of them are disregarded save for a flashback scene way later into the show. It was to my surprise that these two had appeared within five chapters of the manga, which baffles me because I don’t know why that choice was made.<br />
<br />
The only positive thing I can say about it is the animation. It’s actually not that bad. The character designs were unique and each episode was often consistent. The action sequences weren’t terrible, but still a bit uninteresting. I did like it when the style changed like when a Servamp was using its powers or we were inside their minds.<br />
<br />
Although it had some good ideas and animation, “Servamp” is still pretty boring with nothing to it. If I may be completely honest, the only thing that I truly got out of the show was the opening theme. It’s one of the styles of music that I love, but what got me was how unexpected it was. I had known beforehand that this was based on a shoujo manga, so this opening surprised the hell out of me. Knowing there are major differences in the manga, I may give that a shot someday. Otherwise, I don’t plan on revisiting the anime.

    TL;DR at the end<br />

~Contains Spoilers~<br />
<br />
 Servamp is odd. Not the series itself, because it is by no means unique. Just the fact that it was actually published in a Josei magazine baffles me. Who thought it was a good idea?<br />

 What do you get when you add &#039;figthing for my freinds!!!1!!!&#039; with vampires with a survival game? The answer is a clusterfuck of characters and battles with lame motivations who&#039;s names you can&#039;t remember due to horribly executed master/servant relationships. The plot is very hard to follow at points, but from what I did follow, it wasn&#039;t that good to begin with. The conclusion,

        to top it off, is satisfying. Like, very satisfying. Almost made me wish that the series  actually had something good earlier so I could&#039;ve gotten at least a bit of enjoyment out of it.<br />

ART: 4/10<br />

 Servamp&#039;s art and animation just scream &#039;bland&#039;.  The animation seems to avoid any difficult  character positions which looks weird at some parts. The art is colorful at the very least, but still feels dried up almost, like it sat in the sun for too long.<br />

SOUND: 4/10<br />

 For the most part, the voice acting, though half of them were annoying, were unique, and it helped the terrible characters become a little more distinguishable. As for the rest of it... well if you like heavy metal blaring in your ears, this is for you.<br />

CHARACTER: 2/10<br />
<br />
 The characters are frustrating to me. Mostly, because even if they are all VERY sexualized towards a female audience, some of them still look pretty cool! Kuro especially, and that lobster guy. Oh, and the piano kid. I don&#039;t have a reason to look up their names; the show didn&#039;t give me one. Despite some having alluring designs, they&#039;re motivations are so lame, it&#039;s hard not to laugh as they yell the way only anime characters can.<br />

TL;DR: 3/10<br />

+Satisfying ending<br />
+Some good character design<br />
-Everything else<br />
<br />
 Servamp isn&#039;t worth your time, honestly. Even if you are looking for an anime exactly like this, Owari no Seraph outclasses it in every way. And THAT should say something.

    As a collector and reader of the manga of this series, I was really excited when the anime came out… but at this point, if I were to refer this to anyone I&#039;d tell them to read the manga first. I feel like the adaptation went well but not as well as it could have went. <br />
<br />
For the story, as it happens in lots of adaptations of any manga, the sequence of the plot changes a little and that can be quite a put-off. Some of the original story isn&#039;t even adapted and others are either short or expanded. It feels like episode to episode,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230477">
        your opinion of the show itself changes…<br />
<br />
The art and effects are still very well done, like the fight scenes. The <br />
mangaka&#039;s original style, like the thick and rough paint brush strokes for the &quot;dramatic&quot; effects, are incorporated in a good way. The animation is very clear, also. I&#039;d say what I didn&#039;t wnjoy was the stop-start of character motion in comedy scenes…I feel like there wasn&#039;t enough done on top of that to give the watcher the notion that it even was a comedy scene. <br />
<br />
The bgm could have been a little better. Where it was good, it did well to bring the moment to life I&#039;d say. The theme songs help set the mood for the show in a positive way-- like the OLDCODEX op gives off the dark and action-ish feel and the cv ending brings more life to the characters. (I really enjoyed the ed because it was cute lol) <br />
<br />
The cv&#039;s do a very good job of voicing the characters…I&#039;ve had plenty of moments where a character appeared and I was like &quot;wow, that&#039;s exactly what I thought he&#039;d sound like!!!&quot; As far as development goes, some characters are focused on more than others so it feels like you know them more (example Kuro and Mahiru) and everyone else just kinda fits into their roles and that&#039;s it :( because their backgrounds aren&#039;t adapted much at all. <br />
<br />
Overall, I do enjoy the adaptation as much as I do the manga. I did notice the friendship theme and it&#039;s strong prevalence in the plot…which isn&#039;t bad but it does make up a large theme of the series itself…take it out and it would be completely different and would probably have a more mature feel to it. The action is good and the dramatic scenes could&#039;ve used a little more work I believe. &quot;Yes!! More dark shoujo is needed in this world!&quot; is what I thought when I first started to enjoy the series (and is true after all). It&#039;s all guys (yessss) pretty much so for shoujo/reverse harem fans it isn&#039;t very hard to find a bias or two. No romance either (that was a plus for me) so it doesn&#039;t interfere with the plot. I do feel the anime was a little underrated but there are different types of watchers out there, no? <br />

    There&#039;s no denying that Servamp has some of the usual things that you expect from anything involving vampires like the vampires increased regeneration, strength, etc.   I think it was a new idea though to have them bonded to humans, called their eves, and form a pair.  Forming a pair made them a little more fragile, but they also got another person to help them and all the pairs shown worked well on their own as well as with other servamp and eve pairs.  <br />
<br />
I liked Tsubaki&#039;s development, Kuro&#039;s, and Greed&#039;s; I also enjoyed how Mahiru and the other eves grew too.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229641">
         The action was also  a huge plus for the show, even though it could always be better.  Despite how much I enjoyed the show, I think there was too many plot twists.  Every-time that they carried out one plan, another huge huge event or just sometime they didn&#039;t account for would take place.  I&#039;ll still give this an 8/10 because it was really enjoyable, the theme song was really good and added to the mood, and the characters were all lovable if you like their personalities.  If you think, the things I mentioned sound interesting, watch it, if not, avoid it.

    Normally I try to keep anime and manga reviews separate but in the case of this series I think the manga needs to be taken into account. I also want to make note that I am HUGELY particular when it comes to anything dealing with vampires so if I liked a vampire series there must be something good about it.<br />
Overall I really enjoyed this series. I adore all the characters and being some one that does yaoi shipping all the time I love that this series just hands you the material on a silver platter. This is another series that has a character for everyone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230234">
        to fan over and the voice cast is very spot on as well. The story is also very unique in the idea that the vampires serve the humans they drink from and are bonded to them. It does have a slight black butler feel to it so I feel like fans of that series (which I am one of) would really enjoy that aspect of this show.<br />
However, this show does have quite a few faults that can&#039;t be ignored but I feel like its import to say that most of these issues could be solved with a second season. I quickly went and found the manga to read and I realized that episode 9 of the anime is chapter 31 of the manga. I think what&#039;s happened is the anime team decided that rather than trying to properly introduce 14+ important characters in just 12 episodes they choice to pick out the story arches that focused mainly on the 2 main characters and probably intend to fill in the rest of the content later if the first season does well and gets green lighted for a season 2. I could see how the story arches could easily be told in a different order than they are told in the manga in order to make that possible so most issues should be fixed if a season 2 does happen.<br />
With that in mind i have two issues with this series. First is that virtually no questions get answered as to why the vampires powers work this way or even the details on exactly how their powers work or even larger picture questions &quot;like are these the only vampires in the world or are there others that don&#039;t work this way&quot;. You are told in the manga that a lot of these things are a mystery even to the vampires themselves because they don&#039;t particularly like what they are and don&#039;t want to investigate it any further. My other issue is that the ending of this segment of the anime is super fast and doesn&#039;t explain at all how the issue actually got resolved. I haven&#039;t fully caught up with the manga yet but I suspect that the wrap up of the last story arch was happening pretty much at the same time as the anime was being produced and again the ending could always be better explained in the first episode of another season.<br />
Overall I really enjoyed watching this series for the story theme and characters (and this has to be the funniest role i&#039;ve ever heard chuck huber do). I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys things like black butler or even blue exorcist but keep an open mind to the potential it could have in the future or even read the manga as well.

    First of all I&#039;m a big fan of the manga from this anime, so that&#039;s why I thought it would become really good but it really failed..<br />
<br />
From Ep. 1-3 it&#039;s exactly like in the manga, after that they deleted scenes, changed scenes which where really good and make them worse. It&#039;s the first anime I have seen where they have used important scenes to make them as short as possible to let them run concurrently just like in the episode with C3. <br />
For me it looks like they just want to bring everything in 12 episodes as fast as they can do.<br />
The anime based on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229133">
        one big annoying problem called &quot;Friendship&quot;. It may would become a little bit better if they had used 1 or 2 &#039;friendship moments/sentence&#039; what ever fewer.<br />
The characters are interesting but not really that good. We have 7+1 vampires and there Eve&#039;s and a few freaks from C3 and a strange Doctor, that&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
[I&#039;m sorry if my english is not that good]<br />

    This review is made with those who have read some of the other reviews, but are still undecided, in mind.<br />
<br />
I decided to watch this anime since I remember reading the first couple of chapters of the manga a few years ago. While I have no idea how the manga progressed, considering this anime was only 12 episodes while the manga is still publishing, it&#039;s obviously not going to follow the manga to a tee; that being said, that doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t be great on its own. Unfortunately, while I find myself wanting to read the manga, it&#039;s because I want to know just how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230251">
        badly the anime screwed things up.<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
The story premise is decent enough, but the progression in the anime was awful. There was one episode towards the end where a good chunk was the backstory of a character that did practically nothing for the plot; what was covered could have easily been summarized into two minutes of brief flashbacks (as opposed to the long ones) so the viewer could understand a few of the dynamics between this character and a few of the others. On the other hand, some of the most anticipated battles get...well, no screen time. And the ending of the series was pretty much the default ending for a few of the episodes, since apparently, the writers couldn&#039;t be bothered to create a special final line for the last episode.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
The art was interesting at times, but ultimately, nothing special.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
The opening is heavy metal, so I&#039;ll admit I was biased towards it, not being a fan of that genre. I tried to listen the whole way through the first time but just couldn&#039;t bring myself to. The closing is pretty random for the series and a total contrast to the opening. While there is music throughout much of the series (courtesy of one of the characters), the music played often feels misplaced, making it even annoying. The sound of one of the characters (hint, the one who says &quot;happy birthday&quot;) I felt was well done.<br />
<br />
Character: 4<br />
The main character Mahiru was made annoying; by that, I don&#039;t mean his character type (which is also annoying), but I mean he was literally made to be especially annoying even for his type. How many times do we have to be reminded about how he likes things &quot;simple&quot; (his definition of simple isn&#039;t the average)? Turns out quite often. Kuro, the other main character, is actually the only character I cared for in the whole anime by the end; kitty Kuro and his silly moments are actually some of the few highlights of the show for me. <br />
Besides those two, we have the tsundere friend; the two extra friends who have almost no screen time outside of the first episode; the snobby rich kid; the &quot;hot&quot; guy who appears to be a lolicon (which none of the characters even comment on...); and featuring the villain who is psycho but with some &quot;sad&quot; backstory...actually, make that villains. That&#039;s not even all of them, but you get the idea. Granted, stereotypical character types can still be done well to where the characters don&#039;t feel recycled, but in this anime they aren&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
The best way to watch this is probably to binge-watch and finish it in a day or two; it retains some entertainment value at least since you keep anticipating those revelations and epic battle scenes, while not giving yourself enough time to get frustrated that they still haven&#039;t showed up, just to let all the disappointment and frustration sink in after you finished. I personally binge-watched, finished the series in two days, and looking back I don&#039;t want to think about how I would be feeling if I had watched this weekly as it was airing.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
To be honest, I&#039;m probably being generous, but there&#039;s a lot worse out there in my opinion. I can&#039;t compare this to the source of material (the manga), as much as I wish I could. I can only assume that they crammed as much as they could, based on what was published, to try to create a full series while making an alternative ending; an ending which, quite frankly, sucked. If you have free time, and have nothing better to watch, go ahead and watch Servamp. Otherwise, go ahead and watch the next series on your to-watch list.

    (Non-Spoiler Review)<br />
<br />
Upon starting this anime, I had high expectations (for some random reason). I&#039;d heard it around enough times that I assumed it would be really good. But boy was I disappointed. Torn between a 6 or a 7, the overall rating I had to give it was a 6. <br />
<br />
Most animes peak either in the middle or are great straight off the bat, only to progressively get worse, or (more rare) are good all the way throughout. Rarely ever have I seen an anime slowly get better within 2-3 episodes and then drop back to bad within a couple minutes. <br />

        of watching Servamp I had determined that it was a waste of my time. But I pushed through, cause like I said, most animes will pick up from episode 3 onwards at least. <br />
<br />
The plot seemed a bit.. childish. The premise was interesting but the way it was executed was childish. The MC was whiny and annoying and his character development wasn&#039;t even worth sticking around for. It lowkey seemed all over the place. If anything, Servamp got worst as I went along. Most of the characters follow the usual tropes, in other words, they weren&#039;t original at all. The MC was definitely the worst character, he had literally no redeeming qualities. Three of the characters had their own catchphrase that could turn this anime into a drinking game (&quot;Not interesting at all&quot;, &quot;what a pain&quot; and &quot;thinking simply&quot;). I could list so many other flaws, but the anime does actually have some good points. <br />
<br />
Firstly, despite how annoying the MC was, I liked his backstory. I liked the reason why he always stepped up to be that &quot;someone&quot;. It made sense, lowkey hit me in the feels and I was excited to see where it would take him (it didn&#039;t take him anywhere but we&#039;re focusing on the good). Secondly, though most of the characters were stereotypical, some were quite enjoyable. They were all pretty eccentric and quirky in their own way, but overall likable. Some of the side characters feel a little underdeveloped, and although that would usually be fine, this anime gives them some unnecessary screen time for being underdeveloped side characters. It made me feel like they were important but then never went further to develop them. <br />
<br />
And here&#039;s why I struggled between a 6 and a 7. Hyde, Licht and Tsubaki are the best characters in the show by far. Ofc, personal opinion, but Hyde and Licht carried the show for me. Everything turned around for me when a whole episode was dedicated to Hyde&#039;s back story, and it made me appreciate the pair a lot more. I loved the character and relationship development, the backstory was really good, I wish they had shown more of Licht&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Then Tsubaki was amusing from the very first episode (which I think he was in, if not, second episode). They had dropped subtle hints of his character from the beginning, which Sakuya played the perfect role in (sidenote: Sakuya was also a very good character and miles better than the MC, understandably doesn&#039;t get that much air time as he is a side character for most of it). His backstory was also spot on and I wish they had shown more of it, it felt like it was rushed through as it was only shown towards the end. <br />
<br />
And aside from the final couple of minutes feeling like a mess that was quickly put together, the episodes prior to that were the peak of this show for me. Maybe it was just because it was the climax, but the quality just seemed to get better. I was definitely more invested within 3 episodes, had liked the characters more and didn&#039;t want it to end. The MC also didn&#039;t have that as much screen time towards the end as he did throughout everything, so maybe that&#039;s why lol. <br />
<br />
Overall, it wasn&#039;t as bad as I thought it was when I was watching in the beginning. I really thought I would&#039;ve rated this a 4, if not for the sudden shift in priority with the characters. I wouldn&#039;t say it makes this worth watching though, hence the 6. I&#039;d recommend this if you&#039;ve exhausted every mid anime possible (by personal opinion and preference), but otherwise, you&#039;re better of finding something else. <br />
<br />
Sidenote: Kuro is funny and has a somewhat relatable personality. However, he is glued to the MC and so that naturally decreases the quality of his air time from an 8 to a 4.

    Press CTRL (command if an apple peasant) + F and enter tl;dr :3<br />
<br />
Personally I really like Servamp. I thought what little humor it had was done well and the story was gripping enough to make me not drop the show. It was &#039;just&#039; about gripping enough so don&#039;t expect an amazing story just expect to be entertained because this show definitely does that.<br />
<br />
Now onto the characters. We have Kuro, a vampire who can turn into a cat. Mahiro, a simple guy but quite unique. Sakoya(I think), who is his mate and other various characters. I really liked Kuro and wanted to learn about his backstory

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234332">
        from the get-go and I was supplied with it. The rest of the cast are ok and the only others which stand out are Lawless and Licht who are my fav side characters in the show.<br />
<br />
The opening is really good. Possibly top 10 maybe. It&#039;s softcore-ish rock, compared to what i&#039;m used to, and is really nice to listen to.<br />
<br />
The animation is awesome. Full 1080 with really nice visuals make the show have nice impact. Angles aren&#039;t One Piece crazy or anything but it&#039;s nice.<br />
<br />
Overall I really like it but there is one thing that bugged me and that is....<br />
<br />
The ending. It&#039;s not explained. Not even to the point where it is a cliff-hanger I just didn&#039;t understand why x happened at the end of it. It was bs tbh.<br />
<br />
But anyway thanks here is a too long:didn&#039;t read section<br />
<br />
tl;dr Really nice show I enjoyed it, sick op, sick visuals but a bad ending and not many remember able characters

         I just finished watching the last episode, I didn&#039;t really like it. I personally think the anime tried to fit what could&#039;ve been 24 or 25 episodes into 12 episodes. This is because they didn&#039;t introduce a lot of the servamps and eves, didn&#039;t explain C3 thoroughly enough, and the storyline was kind of unorganized and all over the place. It was very anti-climatic and overall kind of confusing. I also think this anime had poor character development. <br />
~It&#039;s one of those anime with great potential, but poor set up (the way things played out wasn&#039;t very organized), but that&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231265">
        just my opinion.<br />
<br />
     The character design was amazing (visually) and they had cool and unique features/traits but they weren&#039;t developed deep enough. A lot of characters just showed up and had a mini background story, but to me that was kind of weak. The development (background info.) on the characters was merely just enough to make them relevant to the story line, rather then deep development that makes the character understandable. I understand that this was only 12 episodes, but I&#039;ve seen anime with only 12 episodes that can perfectly develop characters.<br />
In addition to poor character development many of the characters showed up, like servamps and eves, but weren&#039;t developed at all. To me I thought it would be important to at least meet all the servamps, but only some were introduced.For example, the queen that Greed (Hyde) was infatuated with had more screen time then most of the servamps, and she was only used in a background story to &#039;develop&#039; him. While Greed and Licht (the angel) were my favorite parring, I personally think they had better character development than Mahiru and Sloth/Kuro/Sleepy Ash (the main characters).<br />
<br />
     Another problem I had with the anime was it was a little confusing and kind of unorganized. There was a point in the story where there was a flashback about the Servamps and Kuro&#039;s history with his family. While it was a good idea to include the flashback into the plot, I personally think it should&#039;ve been elaborated on more. It was a quick flashback that apparently was a big deal throughout the show. It seemed like something so small in the plot, but it affected the main characters in a way, that I think, shouldn&#039;t have been such a big deal. I saw it as something in the past, but it kept coming up as something that affected the relationships between multiple characters.<br />
<br />
     Adding on to my list of picky complaints, I think the goal/reasoning (for the anime) wasn&#039;t evident till the last episode, this anime&#039;s antagonist wasn&#039;t made a big deal (in my eyes), his appearance was minimal. The conclusion of the anime was based solely on stopping this antagonist, but I just thought he was a crazy man everyone need to keep an eye out for. In the end, the way the plot played out, it made it seemed like this anime didn&#039;t have a point.<br />
<br />
     As you can see character development and plot are kind of a big thing to me, and I know for some people it isn&#039;t and that&#039;s where people may disagree with me, but this is my two cents on everything ~.&lt;<br />

    As someone who never read the manga, this at first was an alright vampire anime with pretty good art and character development. Half way through it took a lot of effort just to sit through a whole episode without falling asleep or getting up and doing something else... watched most of the series in 5-10 minute pieces. Started off at about a 7.5/10 but slowly got to about a 4.5-5/10. I was very disappointed that after all the action/anticipation the ending is not completed with a &quot;season finale battle&quot; so to speak. Don&#039;t worry, that&#039;s not a spoiler to anything but this being a bland

    I don&#039;t really understand why many people dislike this show. I will say it wasn&#039;t the best, but it didn&#039;t suck. I give Servamp an 8/10.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story wasn&#039;t that bad. It didn&#039;t have any depth though. It was kinda cliché. MC gets some sort of special something and then tries to save the world. But the whole servamp concept makes up for it. BTW a servamp is a servant vampire if you didn&#039;t know that already. I liked the story, it was well written well. Except for the ending, just saying. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound:<br />
The art and sound were not bad at all. But they weren&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232970">
        amazing. The art was average, but not terrible. It was colorful and had some detail to it. And some scenes the art was AMAZING. For the sound, it didn&#039;t really stand out to me, but it fitted the show nicely.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I personally loved the characters. Even the characters that don&#039;t have much screen time are still ok. I didn&#039;t really hate any of the characters. The bad guy, Tsubaki, insane. I mean insane! The MC, Mahiru, however was kinda generic. He&#039;s the character that will run into a battle head on, risk his life for a friend, you know that kind of character. My favorite characters by far would have to be Lawless and Licht. When they were first introduced I thought they would be my least favorite characters, I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I really enjoyed Servamp. It had good fight scenes, good comedy, and a nice flowing story. But the ending did kinda suck.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)<br />

    Servamp Anime Review<br />
By: Tanaka Strike<br />
April 23, 2019<br />
<br />
Overall: 7.8<br />
<br />
Plot: 7<br />
<br />
As long as a human being is alive, there&#039;s only one thing that won&#039;t change. It&#039;s the sin of a human. The story is about seven vampires of which also named as seven major sins. It starts when a student picked a lone beautiful black cat on the way home, not knowing that it was a vampire. Along the serues, a bond between them will grow. And the past which Kuro, the vampire of sloth, wanted to bury will bring into light. There&#039;s really no amazing plot, interesting twist of the story, or unexpected turn of events

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307430">
        that happen. What excites me is the flashback of their past and the regret felt by the protagonist of the story. The way the story shows that sin is a natural part of life, the people make mistakes and acceptance is always around the corner. I also love the words of wisdom the characters said from their own perspective and belief. But it is kind of incomplete, it is lacking of justification and explanation as to why and how that thing happened. <br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
I hate weak characters. I hate those type who talk much more than do. Those who always blabber about their ideals, but is useless is really annoying. Well, the MC of the story is human so I guess it is understandable. What I find irritating is his speech of hope and friendship and saving, the kind of character who&#039;s only dependent on something dependable. Rest aside his character, the other character are cool and changed in a better way. They realize the things they have done wrong and decided to move forward, accept their mistakes. The fear they&#039;ve felt, the number of times they ran away, they overcome it and was release from the burden they only made themselves. I love the character of Kuro. A very lazy person with an eyebag very noticeable, make me miss Lawliet.<br />
<br />
Sound and Animation: 10<br />
<br />
&quot;Mendokse&quot;. How I heard this expression so many times and how I love it. The voices of the characters are great and catchy. It really matches the expression of them which is really cool. Each of them is different from each other, but their all handsome and cute. The emotions was really attached on the characters expression. Lastly, the pyscho characters voices is really something. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
I wanted Kuro. I love characters like him. Lazy but strong, cute and cool, serious and mysterious. Him being the highlight of the story made me enjoyed watching it. In a way, the series also made me curious of the sins past, the revelations that should happen and felt that I wanted more. <br />
<br />
Ending: 7<br />
<br />
I&#039;m thinking that the ending is out of character. It was plain normal and the way the war cooled off was like a joke. Yes, I understand the human&#039;s emotion can also be answered by the same emotions. I get that he only want salvation, a person who will accept his existence. It is predictable if you see through the character. But as a viewer, you will always expect for more. More unexpected outcome in the end, more surprises and the like. Additionally, there were still unanswered questions. The ending was fine but if only there will be next season, it will be great.

    I liked the concept of servant vampires in a more action centric manga than a romantic one, and I decided to watch Servamp to see how that concept would be handled.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I was disappointed.<br />
<br />
The plot was devastatingly rushed.<br />
<br />
There were so many details that were just glossed over. Hell, there were /characters/ who were clearly supposed to be important and recurring that just got one or two major scenes and then disappeared. Two of the seven deadly sins are only ever seen briefly in flashbacks. What kind of show has characters themed after the seven deadly sins and then doesn&#039;t include all seven sins?<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307418">
        matter of a character&#039;s past and family issues being dangled in front of us and never elaborated on. We know he has them, but we don&#039;t know anything about them. In fact, I&#039;m pretty sure they decided to make the Servamp movie about this. Normally I&#039;d have no issue with that, and I do admit that it&#039;s better than it never being mentioned at all, but I need you to understand that it wasn’t like it was one of those things where they give you a nod to the character’s past, maybe give you a little information on it in passing, and give you a movie on it later. It&#039;s very obvious that it&#039;s a big part of his character. You&#039;re waiting for them to tell you what&#039;s up and they never do. This may be a good way to get people interested in the movie, but its detrimental to the main show.<br />
<br />
Now, this sounds like most of my complaints could be fixed with a second season, right? Wrong.<br />
<br />
The show ends by taking any loose ends and cutting them. Not tying them up, no, just cutting them.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s some things going on with some characters that seem like they&#039;re going to lead into further plot points, and considering the manga is still being published even as I write this, they almost definately do. The anime, however, ends by taking those characters and showing them to us along with everyone else in a neat little &quot;here&#039;s everyone after the adventure!&quot; montage. One of these characters was supposed to be missing. He just came home and the show ended. Everyone is at home and arguably comfortable and it&#039;s clear that it&#039;s supposed to be a series ending rather than a season ending.<br />
<br />
If I were to say one good thing though, the characters are cute and charming, even including some of the ones that don&#039;t get as much attention as they should. Despite my complaints I can&#039;t say I hated watching it.<br />

    Oh, I tell you what, this anime doesn&#039;t deserve the rating it has right now. It went way beyond my expectations. <br />
<br />
The concept of this anime is endlessly interesting to me. Right away, the jumping off point for the plot of this anime was sure to be a success based on the information given to us about Servamps and their Eves. Add on top of that the wealth of interesting characters, and you&#039;ve got the makings of an awesome anime. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s where it went wrong: simplicity (no pun intended for those of you who have seen the anime). Servamp&#039;s potential was really strong, but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298545">
        fell short when it came to expansion. For example, had the anime dug into the history of Servamps a bit more, it would&#039;ve been a lot more enjoyable. You get the bare minimum that you need to understand the story, but there&#039;s so much lost information that would be really interesting to learn about.<br />
<br />
Also, you&#039;ll see these bonds develop throughout the anime that don&#039;t have as much basis as they could have because the relationships lack development. It doesn&#039;t really cause the partnerships to feel forced or disingenuous, but it doesn&#039;t feel like the audience is missing a piece of development. That&#039;s not true of all the characters as one particular pairing had a really lovely backstory that supported their current relationship nicely. However, I would&#039;ve liked for there to be just a bit more focus on the friendships in the anime since the overall theme of it hinges on friendship. <br />
<br />
Besides those things, this anime was tops. It was extremely enjoyable, and I really only came up with those criticisms after watching it and thinking about what issues there were. The characters were fun and alluring, the story was told in a very intriguing way, and I want more of it. I don&#039;t know if a new story is entirely necessary as it probably would&#039;ve been better to have an expanded first season, but I want to watch these characters more. You&#039;re not gonna get deep and complex world-building from this anime, but I think you&#039;ll still have a great time watching it. If all else fails, the humor is perfect. Can&#039;t go wrong with a good laugh.
