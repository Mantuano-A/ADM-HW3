    Initially, I started watching because I liked the sleek and colorful aesthetic, and the idea of parkour races sounded cool. I like the first few episodes and thought the races were exciting and nice to look at, with a killer soundtrack. Upon watching the next episodes up the the sixth that has aired I&#039;ve lost interest, with a super melodramatic plot that makes zero sense, backed up with paper thin characters.<br />
<br />
The sport itself does not even take the least amount of effort to make any sense. It is a race based on speed, but people waste time doing flashy parkour moves. Would it not have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210623">
        made sense to give credit for style points if it is an integral part of the sport? They could have added in a number of explanations for the sport to make it a little more plausible, but there was none. <br />
<br />
Speaking of implausibility, there is the plot. It&#039;s full of melodrama with the characters over reacting to everything like their life depends on it in stand anime fare. The backstory of the stride club and the reasons surrounding people&#039;s reluctance to join is completely laughable. It is the standard annoying anime logic sort of thing where the good guys get bad press in the eyes of the public, but really they didn&#039;t do anything wrong. Such bad press could be avoided by reasonably explaining the situation, but common sense does not exist here. All this serves as set up for the scenes with cheesy inspirational music, inspiring speeches and some nonsense about &quot;connecting emotions&quot; as the stride club works to redeem itself.<br />
<br />
The characters are all one note which makes the dramatic plot points even more lame. It is fine when all they are doing is racing and having fun, but they do not go together with a plot that asks me to sympathize with them. They are also all pretty boys making some of them look downright goofy because of how out of place they are on the stride courses instead of posing for magazines. There is some of that as well; a boy band concert, photo shoots and such show up to appease the fujoshits. <br />
<br />
Visuals: The reason I started watching this in the first place. Unfortunately, you do not get to see as much running as bobbing torso. Not that much of the running gets animated. It was most apparent to me when a big, surprising parkour move was performed, and we don&#039;t get to see any of it. It is all conveyed by implication. <br />
<br />
One aspect I did enjoy was the soundtrack. It got me pumped up for the races and fit well with the artstyle. I&#039;ll be looking forward to the ost release. <br />

    There&#039;s no real explanation to it, so let&#039;s just assume that &quot;alternative&quot; in the title of Prince of Stride implies that you should watch an alternative show.<br />
<br />
So, anyone willing to tolerate sports anime thought this would be pretty cool. Running with some parkour elements? Shit, parkour’s awesome, this oughta be good. But instead, we’ve been given a thoughtless, soulless, utterly boring show with no point in watching to completion unless you really, really like sports or writing yaoi fanfics.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Stride conveniently makes all of its fuck-ups clear within the first episode, so this doesn’t require a lot of work. Every major character (with the exception

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213598">
        of a couple that won’t be introduced until later because reasons) gets introduced within the first ten minutes. It’s too much too quickly, like going to your parents’ favorite hangout and having to suffer through all the introductions to their stupid friends who only talk to you to ask about how school is going. But, don’t think about it too hard, look alive because the plot’s coming through!<br />
<br />
A school with a famous stride club (whatever that is) is now close to disbanding because they don’t have enough members for official matches because no one likes stride. Wait, what? I thought this was famous? Where did everyone go? That doesn’t matter now, because Riku (whose name I only remember thanks to my fifteen years of playing Kingdom Hearts) joins the club and fills the deficit, and now the almighty Honan Stride Club is ready to go. The whole school sets up a course for the club because they’re all so excited to see stride return that they didn’t even remember the club existed five minutes ago, because no sports anime would be accurate without a bunch of bandwagoners! Go Royals!<br />
<br />
Wait, aren’t we forgetting something…………? Oh yeah! WHAT THE FUCK IS STRIDE?<br />
<br />
Stride, the sport, is introduced to us after giving an incredibly vague explanation of just a few things about it. You know, it’s not really the audience’s job to put more thought into your own work. We’re expected to figure the rules of the sport out for ourselves because the authors were too lazy to do it themselves. But after a couple episodes, you can see that stride is just some relay racing with parkour with a coordinator from the sidelines, with some specific details that won’t be necessary. See how easy that was?<br />
<br />
But some questions still remain. Why do we need the gimmicks? What’s the point in the end? One guy did a run while completely skipping the obstacles and nothing really happened, he still had a great run. If they’re there just to make the runs look flashy, it’d be good if you could actually implement flair into the rules of the sport, even making it part of some score. It’d be even better if the parkour was naturally part of the course and not just some shit they threw in the middle of the road. People racing over rooftops and over fences would be pretty badass. They could at least put more shit in the road. But my point is that I’d like it if the parkour had a bigger focus and speed wouldn’t be the only thing necessary.<br />
<br />
Then you have the relationers, who coordinate the runners from the sidelines via headset. One team told their relationer to fuck off and one of the runners did all the work while the actual relationer was there as a formality. If the runners can control things themselves, what’s the point of the relationer in the first place? Shouldn’t this be illegal, at least? Why isn’t anyone even watching this race, like a referee? Does ANYONE care about what’s going on??? WHY AM I ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS?<br />
<br />
Ignoring the dumb sloppiness of the sport itself, we have the actual story. Yes, I care about a story in a sports anime, at least to an extent. It’s a sports anime so you can only expect so much, but as long as you write better than a 10-year-old then I can accept it. But when Stride tries to incorporate some human drama, it just gets idiotic.<br />
<br />
Prince of Stride being about some high school sporting event just won’t cut it, so we need some DEEP and COMPLICATED backgrounds or something. The reason why Honan’s stride club was low on members in the beginning is because of an incident that caused most of the team to quit. This incident is one of the most bafflingly brain-dead events ever conceived. To not spoil it specifically, the old relationer got rekt by the other team’s, and that caused the runners to crash and lose the race. The relationer and another member then act like complete fucking idiots and escalate the situation way beyond reason, and the knight in shining armor, the only person with a brain, the one who breaks it up, is then blamed for it without anyone trying to communicate like human beings. I am laughing so hard while writing these very words right now.<br />
<br />
The other sort of incident involves the main character not knowing how to get gud and then quitting stride for a while. That’s it, that’s his backstory.<br />
<br />
Having some human drama is nice, definitely. I’ll admit that at least the last few episodes had some sort of weight and tension, but all of this is just so stupid, man. But I could at least respect the nerdy guy, he had some actual problems and characterization that wasn’t dumb. Maybe as a token of my appreciation I’ll go look up his name on the database when I’m done.<br />
<br />
Beyond that small number of characters and their dumb stories, the rest of the cast is incredibly flat, boring, uninteresting, generic, and other synonyms, no matter how many memes they try to force. Their only chances of being likable come with how many of their stupid, annoying LOLSORANDOMXD jabs they throw at you. Nice try, Dr. Meme. Oh, whoops, that’s a SIGNATURE PHRASE!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111!!1/1?11/1<br />
<br />
Shoving away that nonsense, the characters include Leg-lover, who’s the only yaoi bait you’re gonna get, unless you got a kick out of that one guy who had to dress up like a girl. I felt like kicking myself in the nuts just for putting up with this. No one else has anything worth mentioning (except nerdy guy who eventually drops out of relevance anyway) except the girl because she’s a girl and she’s voiced by Hanakanamanahawamawallama, which really isn’t a compliment because she doesn’t have a personality either. The only thing she’s good at is being really worked up over what the other relationer is doing. DO YOUR JOB, IDIOT.<br />
<br />
The woman who directed No Game No Life was told she couldn’t make everything purple in this, so instead she used normal colors and brightened them up about a thousand times. Okay, it’s not unbearably bright, but it really isn’t pleasant to look at, even deep into the anime where you’re expected to be used to it by now. The animation itself isn’t that big of a deal, either. In fact, it’s pretty lackluster, especially given that Madhouse used the same budget as One Punch Man. Maybe they spent it all on memes to try and recreate the magic. I dunno. Anyway, doing cool parkour shit is okay. I guess. But the running is often poorly framed--I don’t give a shit about people moving their arms around really really quickly, you run with your L E G S. LEGS, MAN! Some clever angles would’ve made this pretty interesting to watch, but I guess no one cared as usual.<br />
<br />
Hey, remember Overlord? That one anime about Mr. Skeltal trying to take over the world? That opening song was incredible, right? Well, the same guys came back to do Stride’s, except not nearly as loud, exciting, cinematic, catchy, or even enjoyable. Which still makes it a decent song because Clattonia was just pure awesome, but the song doesn’t have a lot of punchiness or flair, and it’s marred by some pretty goofy lyrics. The art accompanying it has some style, at least, even if the runs presented look confusing. The rest of the soundtrack has a number of insert songs, which are pretty intelligible when used amongst the action, but I thought the non-inserts were surprisingly good. Not crazy good, but they have a smooth style and presence and are just exciting enough to make you keep your ear out for them without distracting you from what’s on screen. Not a bad ED either. I only listened to it like twice, though, because I wanted to move on as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
The last thing I wanna talk about are the guys, because this show is supposed to be yaoi-bait and I need to make this clear. These fuckboys don’t even look that good. Thanks for reading, everybody, have a great day!<br />

    Prince of Stride: Alternative was one of the first new Winter show to be announced just as the new year arrived. It was also among the first ones to be aired in the season, much to the build-up that was added to it. With one of the masters in the industry working behind it, i.e. Studio Madhouse, Prince of Stride: Alternative was well worth the hype it had accumulated thus far, but as the season progressed, it quickly started to fade away. Why? Let&#039;s look into it in detail.<br />
<br />
The show brings no creativity at all to begin with. It has been done countless time in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213607">
        sport anime&#039;s before. Famous high school club now in ruins and desperate for new members. Atleast try to be a little more creative. The game of Stride does bring a sense of freshness to the show. Basically its a sport where you run all the while competing with the another &#039;Strider&#039; within your block. It consists of five different members running from start to finish as all the five team members play a part in the whole sequence and give a touch for the next teammate to continue running. One of the problems with the show is that twelve episodes were always not enough to begin with. There are have been countless other similar shows being successful solely based on the fact that they run for a longer time. Time was an important asset to them and they had plenty to utilize it with the execution. This is something Prince of Stride: Alternative lacked big time. On a side note, I cannot understand why there&#039;s a &#039;Alternative&#039; in the title. I&#039;ve come to light that the source material was a visual game and the show can be taken as a spin-off of that.<br />
<br />
The characters on the show do it no good, with all honesty. All of them are like a basic stereotype with nothing to set them apart from any other generic characters. The MC is a light-hearted and silly guy with a dim-wit personality who just likes to run and is aiming to be on as many of the high school clubs as possible. There&#039;s the very cold looking teammate who acts as a direct rival for our MC and who doesn&#039;t talk much, and of course, does not get together early with our MC. Then there&#039;s the only girl in the show who&#039;s in fact the very first characters to be showcased and is another main character in focus in every sense who is inspired by the Stride club&#039;s achievements in the past and is aiming to be in the team as a manager. She eventually acts as a Relationer in the team who serves as a guide to the running teammates offering guidance with a speaker directly to the Striders. Then there&#039;s always a trap in the group along with a nerd who isn&#039;t interested being with the club to begin with. Two more senior characters are there in show, one&#039;s a cool, handsome looking guy who seems to be a senior worth relying on, and the other, literally having nothing worthy of praising, in my opinion. The manager however, was an interesting characteristic with his regular inspirational proverbs with a traditional discipline to them. Sad that he didn&#039;t get called a &quot;King&quot; when someone who only afterwards in the show arrived got to be called one.<br />
<br />
The art totally makes the show cool, and the aesthetics are on the positive aspect of this show. The OP/ED sequences with the music, too, do justice for the show but no OST&#039;s or background musics or other character songs worthy to be talking about. But all in all they&#039;re on the better side of the show. The frequent use of English in the show, as for the club names and the outfits, really make them appealing to the western audience too.<br />
<br />
Prince of Stride: Alternative also suffers from the problem of not being able to convey the story properly in my opinion. It could&#039;ve have become a good show even with the distinguishable flaws it had, if it had put more effort in giving the concept of Stride a little more spotlight. The sport is cool by all means, but for me it fails to properly deliver some important stuff to the viewer. For example, the tournaments the Stride Races take part in are a little difficult to understand. They do time-trials at times but nothing on the opposing team is showcased (And trust me there are some) on how they got so far. This is where as I said the time limit plays a huge part in. Stride races also offers a lot of cool moves and spectacular jumps, if they had put on something like additional points for that, then I think the games would&#039;ve become a lot more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Prince of Stride: Alternative was never a profound show to begin with, as is the case with most of the sport shows. But what make them great is the reality aspect and the execution for it, that&#039;s where Prince of Stride: Alternative won and lost 50-50 for me. With the pacing and time limit the show had been given, I could see the ending being like that from a mile away, still Prince of Stride: Alternative has the little charm that&#039;s the beauty of every sport show, even if it was a short anime with just twelve episodes. <br />

    Prince of Stride, a show based off of an otome game with a bit of sports and competition added in. Advertised as a sports series, yet it’s obvious that the show appeals to the female audience with its cast of pretty boys. What is striding? It’s basically a fictional extreme sport of running similar to that of parkour but with unique obstacles. <br />
<br />
Produced by Madhouse studio, the show runs pretty fast on its feet, literally. The first episodes introduces the main characters in standard fashion. Nana Sakurai, the main heroine transfers to Honen Academy and quickly becomes the manager of the Stride club, a club

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213596">
        dedicated to striding. The members of the group consists of a variety range of characters and personalities ranging from the cheerful Riku Yagami to the cool Takeru Fujiwara. Each member of the club also possesses individual skills and characteristics that makes them unique on the team. While this is all good and dandy, the show doesn’t capitalize on their traits but instead follows a generic route of competition. Yes, there’s risks and strategy that is adapted into each race. However, the ending result usually is predictable. And that’s honestly something that isn’t so admirable.<br />
<br />
The story structure is designed as more carefree although striding is the main course of the plot. Other times, the show feels like it’s taking a breather such as fashion shoots, hot springs, and even the infamous beach episode. In general, the story turns into a mixed affair of comedy and competitiveness. If that makes any sense, the series also takes every advantage of the boys to make them stand out as bishounens. There’s nothing wrong with that except the show focuses perhaps a bit too much on it for the first half of the series. It takes the serious nature of the striding when the boys are presented more as fan service rather than athletes. On the other hand, the show does take its game mechanics seriously. Every relay race is designed aesthetically and never the same. In addition, the show adds commentary to explore the physical aspects of the obstacles, short-cuts, and potential strategies runners can use to their advantage.<br />
<br />
However, the story isn’t the main problem with the show. The main problem lies with the characters. It’s hard to feel attached to any of them. Takeru is like a Free clone of Haru but hardly has a strong relationship that can be relatable. Riku adds a bit more of casual atmosphere that people can get used to quickly but it’s hard to accept his character. He’s just too damn carefree. Heath Hasekura, the half-man, half-model is probably Mr. Fan service and there’s little depth about his character at all.  Finally, Hozumi Kohinata exposes almost all the weakness of the show with his non-existent characterization, girly face, and weakly timed jokes. Luckily, there’s some characterization and background storytelling through mid-story but the overall execution lacks steam. Don’t expect Honan Academy’s rivals to be memorable either. They have cliché written all over them with easily forgettable characteristics. <br />
<br />
If you’re interested in some fun excitement, then Prince of Stride might be a show for you. While the storytelling and characters are easily forgettable, the relay races themselves lives up to the hype on most occasions. Stride is apparently a fictional sport so the rules and risks are a refreshment to any sports fan. It invites speculations on what strategies can work and what may fail. The risk is also realistic as well that includes near fatal injuries. Furthermore, the show does a clever job highlighting the body movements of the athletes. Each episode is choreographed consistently whether it’s jumping across shortcuts, bypassing obstacles, or just running against the wind.<br />
<br />
The artwork is like colored rainbows. Bright and flashy are just few of many words that can describe the background visuals.  It also has a sense of flamboyant feel as each relay race has a different style unique to each competition. And of course, who can forget about the boys? They are the main stars not just for being athletes but an eye candy for the female audience to see.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is surprising attractive with a good amount of psychology mixed in. There’s good timing during crucial points of each relay race to capture the thrill of competition. It’s also creative enough to be legitmently entertaining to the ears. Character voice mannerism is moderate although I personally find them lacking with the exception of Riku. Meanwhile, the OP and ED theme songs are rather mediocre in respect.<br />
In essence, Prince of Stride is more of a show that seems to appeal to a certain demographic and advertised for the audience to play the game. It isn’t an entirely awful show despite the lackluster story or mild characterization. Rather, it doesn’t deliver with the premise and each episode seems to lack more and more steam as time drags on. I find it hard to also get attached to many of the characters and in the end didn’t really find liking any of them. Blurring the lines of fictional sport and modern man service, this is a show that easily feels like an advertisement.<br />

    Introducing Stride: an extreme high-thrilled sport where parkour and endurance running collide together! <br />
<br />
The rules of Stride are really simple: you form a team of six people and you compete against one other team. Five of you run across the race course as a relay, avoiding obstacles, and staying on track. The fastest team who crosses the finish line first wins. <br />
<br />
It’s definitely a very interesting concept straight from the get-go. So why can’t I rank this show any higher?<br />
<br />
Well, for one, whenever you introduce a sport, it is imperative to consider your audience: they have no clue what the sport is about or never

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213602">
        even heard of anything like it before. Furthermore, sports often incorporate a lot of new terminology that can lose the audience quickly. As a result, the screenwriters must absolutely take the time to explain these terms well.<br />
<br />
This is where Prince of Stride begins to crack. In the first few episodes, terms such as “relationer” will be thrown at you and leave you second-guessing until you actually see it in action. Techniques associated with parkour or the relationing process itself, too, are never properly explained. And, most importantly, the rules of Stride are very open, and this is a recipe for disaster. For instance, shortcuts – what exactly constitutes an acceptable shortcut? Couldn’t you technically just “shortcut” an entire leg? Since this rule and others like it are never thoroughly explained, viewers who are making an attempt to understand what is happening are more than often left hanging and utterly confused. And mind you that this is just one rule  – there are plenty of others that don&#039;t make any sense either.<br />
<br />
The other issue is the characters themselves. As you probably know, Prince of Stride centers on the members of the Honan Stride team. The characters on this team had serious potential but were never given ample time on the show to have enough depth. Some characters were given no time at all and honestly were not a significant factor in the show (e.g. Hozumi). They could have been left out from the story and the plot of the entire show would not have changed much (minus the fact that you would have an incomplete team, oops). Others are what I like to call half-baked: some characterization but somewhat forced. A good example of this is Nana. Nana’s true colors begin to show when her father shows up back in Japan, but since her father was never mentioned up to this point, it seems as if his entire purpose was to elicit some emotional response from her. Thus, her actions and thoughts come off as a little unbelievable. I would argue that the only decent characterization was of Riku (see episode 11), since we later learn that he uses Stride as a way to dissociate his own identity from his more talented brother’s.<br />
<br />
As for the plot, there isn’t really anything remarkable about it. As with all other sports anime, Prince of Stride: Alternative tries to balance Honan’s training and the tournaments that they participate in. In the first half of the show, there is more training and other trivial things that they do (e.g. obtain a sponsor) than there are actual tournaments, and some of these training sessions do not produce anything fruitful other than heightened, excited emotions. Towards the end of the show, however, the plot finally gets somewhere when the Honan team comes face-to-face against two of their toughest, most challenging rival teams during the End of Summer semi-finals and finals.<br />
<br />
For the art, let’s just say it’s different. The color palette that Madhouse chose to use in this show often comes off as overly bright or pale. It’s not oversaturated as in the colors of No Game No Life but will take some time to adjust to. Despite this, the animation and artwork is very consistent. Sound and voice acting are also of high quality, albeit none of it really stood out.<br />
<br />
So, just to summarize, I wouldn’t say that this is one of the better sports anime out there. Its premise had a lot of potential but unfortunately the plot does not build off from it at all. If you’re looking for a more balanced story or characters with more depth, you won’t find them here. I felt like too often this show came off as a little dry since nothing is really explored well, and it’s likely that you will think this way too.<br />
<br />
Overall rating: C<br />
<br />
Author&#039;s Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis. <br />
<br />
It should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.<br />

    Prince of Stride builds upon the fundamentals of sports anime and brings a more dramatic and innovative approach to the genre. Prince of Stride is revolutionary in a lot of ways and I feel it can convert many who don&#039;t watch sports anime to give it a try. SPOILER &quot;FREE!&quot; (it&#039;s a free anime joke)<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:10<br />
This show goes above and beyond what it would have to do to deserve a great rating for its story. Everyone has a unique story that is connected to at least three other people in the main group of the stride runners. There&#039;s not really any backpedaling with flashbacks so it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218054">
        very fluid. All the main stories are pretty interesting however a lot of them don&#039;t gain momentum until towards the end of the show so hold out if you feel a lack of story in the beginning. While it doesn&#039;t come off as one originally, Prince of Stride has great comedic elements that made me KEK so KEKING hard that I KEK&#039;d until my sides hurt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:10<br />
If you&#039;ve seen any clips from the show or maybe the PV&#039;s you&#039;ll know what I mean when I say this show is vibrant and beautiful. The color scheme is very pleasant and the animations are smooth throughout the entire show. Not much else to say in this area.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:10<br />
I&#039;m not an expert on what makes a soundtrack great but the songs were catchy and did a great job of expressing the themes that weren&#039;t visible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
All of the characters are pretty interesting in their own ways. The show doesn&#039;t feel like it has a lot of forced emotions and the characters stay true to themselves throughout. There&#039;s a lot to say but it would spoil the show and I want to make sure this remains spoiler free.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros and cons:<br />
Pros<br />
-No fanservice<br />
-Great OSTs<br />
-The fucking KEKs<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
-No second season<br />
<br />

    In one paragraph: It was interesting, had some really golden jokes and even the minor characters had personalities. However, there are a lot of plot holes, they skip a lot of the parts that would be interesting to see and the problems they face have a tendency to be really stupid. They don&#039;t really get to any solutions, and there was only one time when we actually saw how they trained. All in all, it&#039;s not bad. Continue reading for more details.<br />
<br />
Story (6): The story begins, like many other sports related anime, with a character introducing themself and explaining that they went to this particular

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213698">
        school because of their team in a certain sport. Turns out that this team has been facing difficulties, and they would have to find more members to get the club working again. The first episodes are really slow and steady, you get the information you need, though probably not all the information you want. Later, the time skips start, so you go from one Stride match to another with a small training segment in between (the training is usually along the lines of running a little and jumping over some stuff and suddenly improving a lot). There are always a lot of details lacking, which I guess can&#039;t be helped when every second episode is an actual match, and there are still episodes that seem to serve no purpose to develop the plot at all. When it actually gets down to it, the scenes that are included are really good, and considering the fact that it&#039;s from a game, you can&#039;t really expect too much thought into backstory and such, since it&#039;s literally based on just the running part. The sport itself is really interesting, basically a baton style race one a track with lots of obstacles, bringing in acrobatics as a theme. <br />
<br />
Art (7): The art is actually very nice, it&#039;s a clean style with no obvious flaws. All the characters look very distinct, with individual eye shapes, noses and body types. It&#039;s very detailed in that sense. The way the clothes are drawn on the characters sometimes looks slightly off, though. The backgrounds are slightly over the top sometimes. It catches the feel of the situation, but the colors have a tendency to be extremely bright. Most backgrounds are repetitive, with some exceptions. There are also a lot of sceneries in this show that look absolutely stunning.<br />
<br />
Sound (7): The opening and ending themes really fit the show, it&#039;s particularly cool that they use the idol group from the show to create a theme. The soundtracks in the show are really good, I don&#039;t know what their names are so I&#039;ll describe them like the sound, the light sparkly tone is really... Light and sparkly, which makes it perfect for those tensionless middle scenes. The &quot;end of summer&quot; track is really upbeat and tells you something is about to go down... That is, if the scene on the screen wasn&#039;t enough.<br />
<br />
Characters (8): The characters are all very individual, they all have their own respective facial traits and body types. All the characters also have their own personalities, and rather than the standard &quot;everyone is super friends with everyone&quot; kind of style, there is a very realistic parting in who gets best along with who. The characters also have roles in the story that makes them important, which isn&#039;t seen way too often. Of course, it doesn&#039;t get a perfect score, mostly because all the characters seem to suffer from being way too emotional about things, to the point where it doesn&#039;t make sense. The comic relief characters also get annoying after a while.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7): It&#039;s a really light watch, since it doesn&#039;t dig into the past of the characters and the story behind what is happening a lot. It focuses solely on the sport itself, and you won&#039;t see any of the problems outside of it. Except for one single character in the main characters&#039; class, there is not a single person not related to Stride that we see more than once. This is probably a great &quot;middle ground&quot; anime, a perfect next step after finishing something that leaves you empty, wondering what you&#039;ll do with your life from now.<br />
<br />
Overall (7): I personally really like this anime, since it does have a line going through the scenes, even though there are some huge time skips here and there. It definitely kept me from not being bored, so it served it&#039;s purpose. The best way to explain it is &quot;interesting enough.&quot;

    Prince of Stride is by no means a masterpiece. It is a light-hearted sports series centred around the world of Stride, a fictional parkour/relay race. While Stride is somewhat different to those common sports seen within the genre, it still fits the mould expected. So what does PoS have to offer?<br />
<br />
The story centers around the Honan Academy Stride team, a once elite stride team, which has dwindled after an incident two years prior. Two first years join the team, expecting to find a thriving Stride team, however they are shocked to find the club only has three members. The basis of the story isn&#039;t groundbreaking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235289">
        or revolutionary, but it is a solid, well-crafted plot which is really enhanced by the sport of Stride. What Stride does well however, is create realistic connections between the main cast. Stride definitely isn&#039;t a character driven show, hell, most of the side characters aren&#039;t memorable, but it&#039;s these relationships within the main cast which makes the drive of these characters powerful. <br />
<br />
The art of this show is beautiful and it is really one of the highlights. The world of stride, especially in competition, is bright and colourful, which really fits the atmosphere of the show.  The character designs, even for one-off rivals, is unique for every character. The action sequences are high quality and one of the best things of Stride. Watching the characters play Stride is nail biting and entertaining, but predictable. <br />
<br />
My biggest gripe with this show is the ending (no spoilers ahead). It&#039;s abrupt and sudden, which bothers me. It doesn&#039;t tie up any loose ends or provide any closure. It&#039;s an ending that makes sense, but it could have been so much better. <br />
<br />
Character development is there, but not significantly. There isn&#039;t enough time to fully explore all of the main cast within the twelve episodes given. It is based off a Otome Game, which I have heard does explore the main cast and even the side characters thoroughly. However it&#039;s impossible to condense 60+ hours of gameplay into twelve 20 minute episodes. <br />
<br />
Just to reinstate, Prince of Stride is no means a masterpiece, nor is it a revolutionary series. But, it IS a fun series. I binge watched it all in a day. It had me so hooked I couldn&#039;t stop watching it. It follows all the same tropes you would expect out of a sports anime, but it follows them well. If you enjoy sports series in general, you will enjoy Prince of Stride.

    I watched this anime series because of Madhouse animating it and that it is based on an otome game, a genre I&#039;m obsessed. But rather I got a lackluster character art, mediocre OP and ED, and did not see romance between the female lead and the other guys.<br />
<br />
It should be stated that being based on a BL (Boy&#039;s Love) game is more appropriate for this anime since the only romantic development in this anime where between the guys. The touching of hands were rather dramatic since it is the theme of the show.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
If you watched Yowamushi Pedal, the story is like that, wherein the club

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213770">
        compete on tournaments and beat schools. It is very straightforward. There&#039;s also the issue of a backstory between the main leads that came out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Though I did like the comedy of the show and the antics. The characters are flat though and their opponents beside Gal-Stan and Kakyoin are so flat since they weren&#039;t explored properly.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
<br />
The OP was upbeat but it wasn&#039;t my type. I really couldn&#039;t remember the ED.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I had high expectations since watching Death Note and Chihayafuru that I will get atleast a artistic anime, but what I got were characters who put too much powder in their faces. The character art was so poor but the background and how they executed the stride animations were spectacular though.<br />
<br />
Overall, I did enjoy the anime because it was fun and I like sports anime.

    What is stride ? Stride is a running sports with parkour. yea... they are running while doing some parkour stuff. tbh, personally, i like the concept of the sports, and even running is one of my fav sports. that is the reason why i got interested in this anime. <br />
<br />
For the first episode, first impression, to me, it was a really cool, awsome episode. i really really like the way they start the series. looks awsome and cool to me, and i thought it would become a great series, but......a little bit dissapointment to me. <br />
<br />
A story about a guy who in the past has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213790">
        quit playing stride because of his brother, but now, in highschool, a girl and a boy invite him or more like force him to join a certain stride club without knowing the fact that he has already quit playing stride. <br />
And that where everything began. but it was a little bit dissapoint me. <br />
<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
because this show is focused more on the character problems and development more than the action on the sports. and the result; they didn&#039;t put much action in the final episode, final race, and that one kinda dissapoint me because i was looking foward to the action. i didn&#039;t mean to say the character development and the problems is bad, i like some of them, and some of them i think it was okay to me, but i don&#039;t like the fact that they focused more on the character rather than the action. it wasn&#039;t balincing in my opinion. AND! the race was too predictable to quess who will win. in sports, that supprosed to be the main problem, the author musn&#039;t let any viewer predict or know who will win. because that will the climax. it is pointless if the viewer already know who will win. it&#039;s not like i don&#039;t like it, it&#039;s just okay to me. i just want to say it&#039;s a shame, a great looking sports like that is too obvious to see who will win. Basically it lacks of impact. <br />
<br />
From the character, they really did a good job in my opinion. they really put their effort to executed the development, problem and conclusion even tho i found their relationship a little bit weird. to me, it wasn&#039;t really bother my enjoyment. to me the pacing was okay. i don&#039;t see anything wrong nor even bother my enjoyment. just the fact that this show is lack of action is dissapoint me. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack was pretty good overall, especially the OP. really like the op. but the ED..... i wish i will never heard it again. well this anime is originally for girls, so obvious some of the song will be something like that. i can&#039;t blame the director but still for me, i don&#039;t like the ED song at all. <br />
<br />
On the other side, good animation for a sports anime. really fit well, especially the soundtrack they used for the action, really good imo. but there is one thing that really pissed me off. some of the character design almost look like a girl and that really pissed me off for some reason. why ? because i almost turn into a gay for a second. it was really a shame, a beautifull character design, the truth is, he is a guy. i really hate that tbh. like i wish that guy is a girl so i can put her in my fav list XD but well, whatever. i don&#039;t give a fuck with it anymore XD <br />
<br />
Overall, not really enjoy it that much but i still enjoy it. i mean i enjoy it but not really 100% enjoy it. well, like i said, i didn&#039;t enjoy it because lack of action. i don&#039;t really like the fact that they focused more on the relationship rather than the action. dissapoint me a little bit. so i&#039;m gonna give it a 7/10. probably never watch it again, BUT! i wouldn&#039;t mind a second season. at least more action. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if what your taste is, but if you like sports, try 1 or 2 episode of this series, the sports is really great imo, but it just didn&#039;t have that many action, and it was kinda predictable. <br />
<br />
Sorry for bad english.<br />
Hope my review can be helpful to you all. <br />
Thanks. Have a nice day <br />

    Nana Sakurai is a first-year student at Honan Academy. She decides to attend the school in hopes of managing the Stride Club. Stride is an extreme sport involving running and navigating obstacles on an uneven course. Nana meets two boys named Takeru Fujiwara and Riku Yagami and convinces them to join the club in efforts to compete in the &quot;End of Summer&quot; tournament. Together, they learn that Stride is about so much more than just running; it&#039;s about connecting with each other. <br />
<br />
...Or so Madhouse would have me believe! <br />
<br />
As someone who has willingly jumped into [and stayed in] sports anime hell over the past

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213633">
        year or so, I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m fairly experienced in critiquing sports anime. I&#039;ve seen all kinds of tropes, some good and some bad, but through it all, I believe the there are a few things all sports anime try to achieve. Whether a sports anime&#039;s characters have hyperbolic, unrealistic personalities or are more well-rounded, whether the sports skills resemble stunts you&#039;d see at Hogwarts or actually seem humanly possible, all sports anime have two common goals in my opinion. The first is to teach viewers about the particular sport in question. And the second is to show how the sport in question changes its characters, typically for the better. <br />
<br />
Prince of Stride fails to achieve either of these goals.<br />
<br />
Stride is never really explained well. We get it, there&#039;s running. But why all the tricks and acrobatics? Can you get extra points for jumping all over the place, or are those tricks simply to get fans screaming? And if the latter is true, then why don&#039;t acrobatic tricks affect a team&#039;s final score? Because they should! In addition, the main characters are never shown to really improve. Aside from Yagami changing his posture, none of the characters evolve in their sport. <br />
<br />
Nearly all of the main characters are flat; they embody one-dimensional stereotypes. Yagami is the angsty teenager going through an emo phase. Takeru is the Furuya of PoS; he&#039;s good at everything just because, and he doesn&#039;t know how to communicate. Sakurai is in the anime simply as a formality, since the anime was adapted from a video game. Kominato and Kadowaki are the comic relief, Heath is the reliable senpai hunk, and Kuga is the strong, silent weirdo who likes to stare at the sky and won&#039;t shut the fuck up about the wind. None of these characters have depth, aside from maybe Yagami, if you&#039;re willing to qualify his struggles as &quot;depth.&quot; <br />
<br />
Multiple episodes repeatedly emphasize Yagami&#039;s inferiority complex, but each episode &quot;resolves&quot; his issues by the end with no believable sequence of events. Prince of Stride attempts to convince us that Yagami truly loves running deep down, but despite it TELLING us that, it SHOWS us a very different message. Yagami seems to hate Stride. He hates his brother, he hates running, and he hates Takeru. But somehow, every episode ends up with him smiling into the sunset, only for him to repeat the same angsty routine in the next episode. <br />
<br />
So here&#039;s the problem: Without dynamic, developing characters, and without even a proper education on Stride, what&#039;s left in this anime? All that&#039;s left are ridiculous amounts of drama, cheap tricks, filler episodes, training montages, the same stupid insert song, and characters on the sidelines yelling &quot;HASHIRE!!!&quot; at the top of their lungs. And oh, so much drama. All of which lead up to a finale that frankly, these characters didn&#039;t earn. Unfortunately, none of those things is enough to make an anime compelling. There are many scenes that attempt to hype up the audience, and they do succeed at first. However, those scenes get old without any connection to the characters, and the anime very quickly becomes stale. <br />
<br />
The art of Prince of Stride is a little jarring, mostly because of the weird color scheme. The shading and coloring of the anime definitely didn&#039;t help promote a &quot;real&quot; feeling to the show. It could have been a strong point, had the plot and characters been up to par. Similarly, the music for this anime was pretty good, but it didn&#039;t have nearly the impact it could have because of the plot and characters. What&#039;s more, many victory scenes used the same annoying insert song until, again, the effect was lost and the song became an annoyance. <br />
<br />
I have always thought very highly of Madhouse, but they kind of missed the mark with this anime. Between the bad character development, misplaced music, and lack of proper exposition, a lot went wrong. I love to joke about being stuck in sports anime hell, but watching this anime was actual hell.

    ummmm lets start with a talk about this sport called S-T-R-I-D-E<br />
<br />
So basically its relay running with parkour, the name is pretty dank tbh, like striding sounds so fuken badass and real I thought it was a real sport and i think it fits really well<br />
<br />
This sport all about the pace,parkour skills and most important of all &quot;connecting emotions&quot;, pretty funny concept gotta say, but why nut? connect emotions = good at stride<br />
<br />
lets continue with the norms<br />
<br />
Story 7/10: Win this summer tournament called &quot;end of summer(EOS)&quot;, simple story, not much to say<br />
<br />
Art 8/10: Coooooooool,siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick, badddddassssssss, Madhouse(the studio), their overall art are always to the coolside of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215108">
        things, colours are to the brighter side of things, when madhouse generally has colours to the dark side of things<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10: OP- dank, OST-feels, ED-it was ok(somehow made it into top10 ed for anime trending) VA wise, they all fit their character, Kuga-senpais voice is badass, Riku&#039;s brothers voice is gay asf, pretty sure he is gay aswell<br />
<br />
Character 8/10: I will comment on  a few characters because there are so many characters, you could say all of them are MC&#039;s<br />
<br />
Fujiwara Takeru(Honan Runner)-Loves the legs, loves his protein, probably the most funniest character in the whole series, he is the most serious person about stride, but he is like dense and does somereally funny stuff<br />
<br />
Yagami Riku(Honan Runner)-pretty badass,dyed his hair blonde,he is probably the major MC, towards the end of the anime, its all about how he overcomes his feelings towards his older brother<br />
<br />
Sakurai Nana(Honan Relationer)-gotta say pretty impressed how she can connect emotions through a mic, probably the most normal character, nothing special about her<br />
<br />
Kuga Kyousuke(Honan Runner)-the man, my favourite character, manly voice, and talks about the &quot;wind&quot; all the time, so cooooool<br />
<br />
Dan(coach)-has some sick one liners(idk what they called, quotes maybe? like a few words, but has a deeper/bigger meaning to it), very funny character aswell<br />
<br />
Suwa reiji(saisei captain)-hes pretty gay, the typical very feminine guy character that is really nice to everyone<br />
<br />
Shizuma Mayuzumi-(saisei relationer)- Reiji&#039;s waifu, if not 11/10 waifu material, definitely most feminine character, long pink hair, cooks, cleans etc<br />
<br />
Everyone above is a male excpet Sakurai Nana<br />
<br />
when i say &quot;gay&quot; i mean it literally<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10: watching people connect emotion is SOOOOOOO fun (being sarcastic here), I guess its like watching sport, I spend 8 hours a day watching cricket so watching 20 min of striding is pretty good<br />
<br />
overall 8/10: Everything is done pretty well, just the normal sports anime, the anime is pretty predictable towards the end, its probably because its a adaption from a visual novel, if you like sports anime, then its definitely good for you, if not, go watch boku dake ga inai machi, you definitely  wont hate it :)

    Now the story is nothing special. It’s basically Yagami Riku and his fellow classmates re-establish the school&#039;s &quot;Stride&quot; team and compete in Stride competitions. I got really hyped especially when reaching the end of each race. I would&#039;ve liked the series more if they did more with Nana Sakurai because I felt she was one of the best character, also I think they should&#039;ve done a little more with Yujiro because he didn&#039;t really do much in the series  Overall, it is definitely a fun watch if you are really into sports theme animes. It has lovable characters and has awesome action moments. But

    I got baited. Hard.<br />
<br />
With the sports anime craze that others and I were in from Haiykuu and Kuroko, I was pretty damn excited to learn of one that focused on parkour/free-running.<br />
<br />
Then I had my hopes dashed as I watched on.<br />
<br />
This is a shitty version of Free, plus I&#039;m not the target audience for this show.<br />
<br />
I could see the intended appeals of the show, but Free does it way better.<br />
What I could not see was the free-running or parkour, which was the sport!<br />
<br />
We had shots of shadows running in the background, or unimpressive vaults that I&#039;ve done on the regular. Being someone into free-running, you&#039;d think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223038">
        they would try and appeal to that audience.<br />
<br />
I could understand the reason of the episode where they needed sponsors for their team, but that meant watching them play cross-dressing dress-up for it.<br />
<br />
Go watch Free for the appeal, or watch Kuroko/Haiykuu for the sport.

    There was not enough story development in my opinion and I feel like the creators of this anime had so much potential to work with but they either had too little funding or were too lazy and tried to make it as short as possible. Sports anime are not meant to have only 12 episodes and you can clearly see why, since the creators did not allow us enough time to warm up and get to know the characters and the story. I feel like the creators rushed the story line because they were like shoving plot after plot up our throats and not even

    This review contains minor spoilers.<br />
<br />
After watching &quot;Haikyuu!!&quot; I became so hyped up about sports series that I decided to try &quot;Prince of Stride: Alternative&quot;. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m disappointed, but compared to aforementioned &quot;Haikyuu!!&quot;, &quot;Prince of Stride: Alternative&quot; looks bland and, on the whole - average.<br />
<br />
The story is as generic as it could get. It revolves around the new extreme sport called &quot;Stride&quot; which is similiar to parkour. &quot;Stride&quot;, however, is not new, neither it is extreme. Sadly, the runners just run, sometimes they jump over some obstacles and somehow, this attracts large crowds and makes runs a big city event.<br />
As with all school clubs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214014">
        in anime there is a girl, and a boy and another boy who have always dreamt of running in &quot;Stride&quot;. They join the &quot;Stride&quot; schoolclub which, obviously, is running out of members and our protagonists miraculously save the club. Then, all of them are training and running. Also, in each episode there&#039;s someone talking about how &quot;Stride&quot; connects people with a mandatory, super-cringeworthy shot of high-five of the runners in the background. And that&#039;s pretty much the story, or what supposed to be the story. Very predictable and unoriginal.<br />
<br />
The art is mediocre. It has its ups and downs but there&#039;s nothing particular in it. The characters&#039; faces seem really weird as they look like they have different shapes in different shots, but overall the characters are nicely drawn. Run sequences are fairly well animated, although there is too little running and too much thinking-while-running shots.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also nothing particular in sound. During the run sequences there&#039;s always some music but in my opinion it is there only because it would be awkward to listen to the boys&#039; gasps for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
When it comes to characters, there&#039;s absolutely nothing original in them. There&#039;s the female protagonist, who is there only to be a narrator and has no personality whatsoever, then there&#039;s the overly enthusiastic guy, the manly guy, Haru from &quot;Free!&quot; and even Sephiroth from FF7 - pretty much the characters we&#039;ve all already seen elsewhere. Each character is pretty much one dimensonial and is involved in some backstory which is absolutely forgettable and is meant to add depth to the characters but unfortunately fails to do so. On the other hand, some of them are sometimes funny.<br />
<br />
Having completed the whole series, I can say I generally enjoyed it despite its flaws. There definitely are better sports series, but also there are definitely worse sports series. &quot;Prince of Stride: Alternative&quot; is by no means a masterpiece, but it&#039;s not a bad show either. This anime just doesn&#039;t shine in any way. If you have some free time, give it a go. Don&#039;t expect too much, though.<br />
<br />
(This is my first review and I&#039;m not native English speaker so there probably are lots of mistakes, so sorry for that.)<br />

    ALERT! Look up the rules of Stride (the fictional sport in this anime) before you watch this because, otherwise, you&#039;re gonna be confused for like the first two episodes.<br />
<br />
Well, this is yet another sports anime to add to my list. Can you name a few sports anime? Haikyuu!!, Free!, Kuroko no Basket? Well, have I got good news for you! Nearly ALL of the seiyuus in Prince of Stride: Alternative have been in at least one of those aforementioned sport anime staples.<br />
<br />
Also, the ONLY reason that this anime isn&#039;t ranked as a 10 is because the storytelling was bit shoddy and the art made everything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296122">
        look super washed out. The story itself was fantastic. I love the elements that were a part of it, such as: Riku and Takeru&#039;s backstory, Riku&#039;s issues with his brother, and the history of the Honan Stride Club. However, the anime didn&#039;t give these plot elements enough time to grow. Had the season been 25 episodes long instead of 12, it would&#039;ve been nice because those things could&#039;ve been elaborated on more. As it stands, you kind of get told something through a couple lines of dialogue without dwelling on it. So, the story kind of expects you to fill in the blanks of your emotions when it should be giving you those emotions. Make sense?<br />
<br />
That being said, I actually did get a little teary eyed at the end. This brings me into the characters. I absolutely loved them. Not only do I love the familiarity of the seiyuus, but I love the relationships the characters have with each other. Again, I wish they could&#039;ve been dwelled on a bit more because there were some really beautiful moments in this anime. It would&#039;ve been heightened had the anime taken the time to develop the individual characters and their relationships to everyone before trying to shove in a meaningful scene. I did still cry though. So, it wasn&#039;t a total failure on their part. Just putting that out there.<br />
<br />
The music was simultaneously emotional and badass. The music that plays when the characters are running is either something that&#039;s jammin&#039; and that gets me hyped, or it&#039;s this one song that conveys all of this emotion that these characters are feeling. Both are really good, so I&#039;m very happy with the music in this anime. I don&#039;t usually talk about music in anime, so that tells you something. <br />
<br />
This anime doesn&#039;t deserve the flak it gets at all. Like, yeah, it should&#039;ve been stretched out and the story and characters should&#039;ve developed more smoothly instead of like &quot;BAM, take this thing we didn&#039;t explain properly before this!&quot; But at the same time, I had such a good time watching Prince of Stride: Alternative. If I&#039;d trusted some of the more negative reviews on here, I would&#039;ve missed out on a really good time. If you&#039;re super picky about a streamlined story, then don&#039;t bother, but if you just want to kick back with some funny characters and have a bit of a cry, then this anime is amazing! As far as pure enjoyment goes, this gets a 10/10, hands down. <br />
<br />
I actually really wish that this anime finds itself in another season. If they slow down the story pacing, I think these characters and this world has a lot of potential. Give this anime a go because it&#039;s honestly really awesome.

    First of all, if I had to describe this anime to a friend in a really succinct way, I would describe it as being a &quot;shittier version of Free! since it has more cardboard for characters and less of a plot.&quot;<br />
<br />
I enjoy sports animes immensely and it&#039;s definitely one of the genres which I enjoy watching more/give higher ratings to. So when I heard that Mad House was making a sports anime, I was hyped. That coupled with the amazing voice actor cast this anime has, and I honestly had no doubts that I would at least enjoy it even if it turned out to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213638">
        not quite meet my standards.<br />
<br />
I was wrong and I&#039;m saying this as someone who did low-key enjoy Free! as a guilty pleasure.<br />
<br />
The first half of this anime feels incredibly tedious. I was bored whilst watching and didn&#039;t find any of the comedy stuff funny at all. The first half focuses quite heavily on characters since there are quite a few character introductions. Usually I wouldn&#039;t have a problem with this but when your characters are pretty much cardboard, it&#039;s just a waste of screen time. I think it was around episode 8 for me when I realised that I was so apathetic towards all the characters that I actually didn&#039;t know any of their names. Obviously this is a major problem for any anime, but especially a sports one. An aspect which makes a sports anime so enjoyable to watch, is that you want to root for the characters/teams because they&#039;re likeable and you want to see them achieve their goal of victory. An especially good sports anime in my opinion will also have the side characters developed so you don&#039;t know who to quite root for... but in both regards, (of having both the main and side characters developed), this anime completely failed. After just finishing the anime, I can only recall the names of 4 characters max and that&#039;s probably me stretching it to be honest. I didn&#039;t root for anyone and I didn&#039;t care about anyone. The characters are quite literally just their character designs - &#039;pretty boys&#039; so fujoshis can ship them together and probably write fanfiction about them.<br />
<br />
Also, I&#039;m not someone to question &#039;anime logic&#039; but the realism of some the stunts displayed is practically non-existent. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m quite the fan of Prince of Tennis and KnB and both of those can be pretty ridiculous at times, but the ridiculous things which happen in those series can sort of be accepted because of how they are set up. In those series, the special moves which some of the characters do are sort of justified by, (all be it - complete bs), stretched physics logic/explanations. There is none of that here. A dude jumps from what looks like some cliff edge and lands on both his feet without breaking anything and continues to run without any sort of explanation? Oh he also swings around a flag pole a couple of times even though he&#039;s seemingly only ever been in the track club his entire life, not gymnastics or whatever. Sure anime sure. (Me nitpicking but it&#039;s something which personally bothered me.)<br />
<br />
There were also some emotional conflicts some of the characters went through and some pointless backstory sort of crudely thrown in half way through which I felt didn&#039;t really add anything at all except maybe help some of the ships sail. Didn&#039;t care for these plot points at all and again, I was bored whilst watching these parts.<br />
<br />
That being said, towards the end of the anime, I was getting some sort of enjoyment out of it. The races in the last few episodes I found myself actually getting a little hyped and I was actually looking forward to the final race... but then they ruined that too. How you think it&#039;s justified to NOT show half of the final race in favour of some shitty monologue is absolutely beyond me. Honestly I was appalled with how that final race was showcased and how the anime ended. When the entire goal of the characters, (and thus the anime), is to complete the End of Summer race and you don&#039;t even show HOW the race ended just the end result in a magazine? Absolutely dreadful.<br />
<br />
Okay so on to some of the few positives of this anime - nothing wrong with the voice acting. Just look at the seiyuu cast and that&#039;s not really a surprise. The OST was fine too and the track played during the races did it&#039;s job in getting me hyped. Not really a fan of the OP or ED but I don&#039;t think they&#039;re particularly bad, just not to my taste.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s mad house so the animation is fine. Honestly, the blues and greens in this anime look absolutely beautiful to me. I&#039;m not really a big fan of the sort of &#039;white-wash&#039; look they have going on with the character&#039;s skin tones though... but again that&#039;s personal preference and possibly me just being nitpicky. Character designs are fine. Nothing too special about them but they&#039;re clearly suited for the demographic this anime is obviously aimed at - fujoshis.<br />
<br />
My personal ratings for this anime:<br />
- Story: 3<br />
- Art: 7<br />
- Sound: 8<br />
- Characters: 2<br />
- Enjoyment: 3<br />
<br />
So overall I would give this anime a 4.

    prince of stride doesn&#039;t really stand out to me that much. it&#039;s plot follows that of a standard sports anime, and although there are a few differences, the plot can be deemed kind of boring. the art is okay as well, and the sounds aren&#039;t that bad. the opening and ending is one of my favourites.<br />
<br />
overall, i would rate it a 7, if not for one thing: the characters.<br />
<br />
the characters are actually not bad, other than the fact that there is very little character development, other than the main protagonists becoming better and stronger. another thing that pulled down the score for it is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220104">
        amount of characters implemented.<br />
<br />
in those short twelve episodes, too many teams were put into the anime. that was the part about it that made me really confused. i mean, yes, they are opponents of the main team, but the matches happened too fast and it seemed quite rushed. <br />
<br />
although prince of stride does not stand out to me that much, there is plenty of fanservice, and like i said before, the storyline is okay, so overall i rate it a 6/10.

    Prince of Stride: Alternative was a fun show to watch. It&#039;s not the best (it&#039;s pretty generic, actually) but it&#039;s a funny and exciting anime that you can watch mindlessly just to pass time. In other words, it&#039;s a sports anime.<br />
<br />
Like most sports anime, the story was not this anime&#039;s forte. A bunch of guys start a sports club in high school, participate in a tournament, fight and bond over some backstory drama and eventually win the tournament. This was just a summary of the entire plot of the series and anyone could have predicted this much based on the first episode alone, because this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213605">
        plotline has been done to death. But in cases like this, the execution of the show is what makes all the difference, and the show had that part down. Running always makes things feel intense, so stride really fits the concept of this anime well. This kind of stories tends to be a safe bet, since there isn&#039;t much to mess up, so the story was predictable but good and well executed overall.<br />
<br />
This anime is a visual novel adaptation, so I expected the characters to be just tropes, with the main heroine having almost no characteristics and being used as a blank space for the viewers to insert themselves into. This wasn&#039;t exactly the case. The characters did fall into certain archetypes (sometimes to the extreme) but they had a little more depth to them and most characters could not be described in one sentence (at least not without using the word &quot;but&quot;). But even though the characters still weren&#039;t great on their own, the interaction between them made the show a lot more fun to watch. The lighthearted shenanigans the characters did together were some of the funniest moments of the show and seeing them hang out with their rivals when they weren&#039;t racing was very refreshing. There was no actual villain in this show and it was really nice to see a truly friendly rivalry in an anime for a change. Also, the lack of romance actually benefited the show. It made the main heroine stand out a bit more as her own character and prevented the anime from becoming too cliched. There wasn&#039;t much character development in this anime, but when it comes to anime like this one, I&#039;m satisfied with what we got.<br />
<br />
The animation in this show was pretty average most of the time. It was very free-flowing during the races, which looked amazing and very intense. On the other hand, some frames were just plain bad sometimes. I did like the strong bright colors, the bold designs and the strong black outlines and shadows that made it look like the frames were inked by hand, but the animation wasn&#039;t a big standout overall.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was very good, actually. It supported the show well while not standing out too much, which is what I expect of an anime soundtrack. It was very fitting for the show and gave off the right vibe. The opening and ending songs were very upbeat and catchy. The random english words in the opening were really out of place, but the song was still fun to listen to and I didn&#039;t skip it once. The ending theme is sung by the rival team (who are also idols, for some reason), I thought it was quite nice.<br />
The voice actors did a very good job portraying their characters and it sounded like they were having fun. The biggest standout, in my opinion, was Kana Hanazawa as Nana Sakurai. Her portray of Nana was so realistic and it sounded like she meant each and every line. This further contributed to making Nana stand out as her own character.<br />
<br />
To sum up: this anime might not have the best or the most original story, but the characters and the animation are decent. The ending was a bit anticlimactic, but still very satisfying. It was a very entertaining show to watch overall and if you&#039;re looking for an anime to watch mindlessly when you&#039;re bored, I recommend checking it out if you have the time.
