        I wasn’t expecting the anime to have a storyline to be on a whole different tier. However the anime definitely could had improved on the overarching story in various ways. Unfortunately, the anime never really improves anything throughout its entirety and leaves off a trail of poor writing everywhere.<br />
<br />
The story starts out when a colossal, unnatural disaster hits Japan which pushes civilians and society into desperation, as any major disaster in real life would. Soon, invaders called Septentriones appear and humans must defeat every one of them using demons they can summon in order to survive. Wait a minute, doesn’t this premise sound a bit familiar? Devil Survivor 2 borrows a lot of the same concept from Neon Genesis Evangelion. However the video game managed to blend in its own traditional and original aspects of the Megami Tensei franchise, (Devil Survivor belongs to the Megami Tensei franchise), thereby allowing the game to hold onto its charm. The same can’t be said for the anime adaptation. Unlike the video game, the anime sheds off every inch of strategy in every battle, and replaces it with random attacks that seem to serve no purpose other than for eye-candy and to weakly move the plot forward. The result is mainly dull action and boring battle scenes.<br />
<br />
One of the first problems that appear in the anime is that it never really genuinely shows how such a monumental impact is affecting the civilians and society. In Devil Survivor 2’s case, world-building is essential in order to allow the viewer to sink in the necessary details so that important aspects such as pacing and plot and character development feel natural. World-building in this anime’s case could had provided more details on the nature of the post-apocalyptic setting, what the order of society is currently like, how various civilians are holding up, the government’s reaction, etc. Unfortunately, the viewer gets none of this in a genuine manner but gets instead various plot devices that jump out of nowhere which feel jarring, unnatural, and in certain cases, make for unconvincing writing in both story and character-wise. <br />
<br />
Enter Hibiki, the main protagonist. He encompasses everything that many other battle shounen protagonists there ever were. He is the hero who jumps straight into action without rational thought. He is the hero who has to save everyone simply because he has the power to summon stronger demons than anyone else. By the way, why Hibiki has been granted this special power while almost everyone else has been left with much weaker demons is never explained until the last remaining few episodes. Even then, the reasoning for this special power is as cliché as it can get. The unexplained unique powers he acquires acts as plenty of plot devices, as Hibiki manages to defeat foes left and right with the help of his powerful demons, and without any convincing struggles. To hurt the writing further, for the first few episodes, this power is the only reason that drives him to become the typical hero that he is and jumps into every battle he can get his hands on. When Hibiki lacks such motivation for his heroic behaviors, he comes off as a very unconvincing character and becomes hard for the viewer to sympathize or understand with. Other characters beside Hibiki also never properly develop, and this makes for much unfruitful viewing containing melodrama and rushed events. In fact, the majority of the characters are hardly even realized, it’s as if they were put into the anime simply to fill up more cast and time and amount to nothing more.<br />
<br />
On top of this, well-known clichés pretty much plague many parts of the anime. One notable cliché and theme used throughout the anime is… the power of emotions. Yes, screaming out loud while also screaming cliché lines can save the day in this anime.<br />
<br />
Devil Survivor 2 the Animation was very disappointing. There is not much of a single redeeming aspect about this anime. Cliches, bland characters, overdramatic scenes due to poor development, weak narratives and overall plot really plague this anime, ultimately coming off childish and dull. And to those who played the game and hoped for a faithful adaptation in terms of story, you will be disappointed. To make it worse for the video game fans as well as for the rest of the Megami Tensei franchise fans, a lot of the Megami Tensei aspects seen in this anime are terribly realized. The anime breaks the laws of the MegaTen universe, such as how Hibiki can somehow summon Byakko as his first demon in the first episode, a high-level demon in the video game. It was also disappointing how the Demon Fusion was actually introduced in the last episode, and it didn’t help that it was intertwined with horrifying writing. Also, did I mention that Jungo is the most awkward character I’ve ever seen in any anime?<br />
<br />
The video game is very fun and addicting. This adaptation can leave one with the impression of the exact opposite.

    I was very excited when I heard a Devil Survivor 2 anime was in the works, having recently played and loved the DS game on which it&#039;s based. Watching it now, I can say that my feelings for the anime are overall good, if somewhat more mixed than I had anticipated. I&#039;m certainly enjoying it, but there are a few places it seems to fall a little flat.<br />
<br />
The anime looks and sounds great. The art is solid; the characters and demons look exactly as they do in the game and the animation is never not satisfying in the action sequences. The voice actors all fit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98423">
        the characters, who were unvoiced in the game, well. Nothing too jarring. The music doesn&#039;t do anything wrong and the OP and ED are both pleasant if not overwhelmingly memorable.<br />
<br />
The story and the characters are where it falters some, and it&#039;s largely because it has too much to do in too little time. The game on which it&#039;s based is a 50 or so plus hour RPG that takes multiple playthroughs to explore everything. To fit it all into 13 24 minute episodes means gutting out so much of the build up and character development that the game had going for it. This makes the characters seem rather lifeless compared to how energetic and enjoyable they are in the game and also limits the scope of the story some. Devil Survivor 2 could be a surprisingly lighthearted and often humorous game, something that made the stark revelations about the fate of the world and characters hold more gravity. Without the time to build all that, the story becomes somewhat deflating. It&#039;s just not as much fun as it should be.<br />
<br />
I love the characters in Devil Survivor 2, and seeing them fully animated is a lot of fun. Without something like the Fate system in the game to develop them and make their bonds with the main character mean something, a lot of what makes them fun is left out though. It&#039;s not just that though; the anime changed a few things it probably shouldn&#039;t have. Joe, who is a part of the group since day one in the game and provides so much refreshing whimsy is reduced to a minor supporting role. Io seems completely different; she smiled a lot more and just came across as a lot less weak. Other characters who can get fully developed in the game are simply killed off prematurely. <br />
<br />
Worst somehow is Hibiki though, surprisingly. He was your ordinary silent protagonist in the game, but how events unfolded did depend on how he acted. In my first playthrough he never missed an opportunity to joke around, was brash, aloof and quick to side with JP&#039;s. The anime version could be different from that though, and probably picked the worst way possible to play him, reducing him to your average mopey shounen protagonist. To make matters worse, the anime decided to make him more powerful than his friends and the other characters from the start. In the game, he and his friends are noticed because they&#039;re resourceful and because it&#039;s a Strategy RPG and he&#039;s able to use his intelligence to win difficult fights and become stronger for them. Having him become the focus from the start because he&#039;s &quot;the one&quot; seems much more hollow and moreover pushes his friends more out of focus than they should be, especially since they were the focus of the game. <br />
<br />
All that said, the anime is certainly not torture for fans of the game. No, it&#039;s actually quite enjoyable to see all the familiar demons pop up and fight. It&#039;s especially satisfying to see how the very familiar Septentrion fights, the boss fights in the game, are handled. It&#039;s not difficult to enjoy the anime, even as I see where it goes wrong and some of the places where it decides to diverge from the game&#039;s story are interesting. <br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t played Devil Survivor 2, I would definitely recommend that over the anime. The anime on it own isn&#039;t bad though. For a non-fan, I&#039;d probably deduct 1-3 points from my overall score, depending on tastes. The characters aren&#039;t going to come across as what they could be not having the time they needed to grow, and the same goes for a lot of the plot development. Still, there&#039;s a lot to like, I think. The animation is nice, the action satisfying and the core plot intriguing enough. I&#039;ve yet to be bored with it at the least.<br />
<br />
Update: Having seen the series to completion now, I had to dock a point from my initial score. I still think the anime looks great and has more than enough moments to justify a watch, but it really just kept making increasingly poor decisions in regards to story progression. There came a point where I found it harder to separate out the experience I had with the anime from that of the game and it cut into my overall enjoyment. Characters and even whole important themes and events from the game are discarded with increasing frequency just leaving it feeling fractured, while the mood is kept more grim than it needed to be, the amusing sequences of the game cut short, skipped over or drained of fun. Meanwhile, the cool stuff it does do slows down considerably--the last few Septentrion fights aren&#039;t as interesting or involving and for some reason the show decides to keep the number of unique demons we see in action very limited. <br />
<br />
I said before that fans would enjoy this, but I don&#039;t know anymore. If you can effectively separate out the good experience of the game as you watch, the anime can still be rewarding with the right expectations. If not, I can see this being a quite frustrating watch. And for non-fans, who don&#039;t know how the characters should have properly been developed, the experience is still probably worse. I almost want to say a seven is being generous, but at the same time I&#039;m glad a great game like Devil Survivor 2 got an anime adaption. I just really wish it had been a better one.

    I had my share of problems with Persona 4&#039;s anime adaptation. Actually, I had a truckload of problems with it. Scratch that, I was finding stuff to complain about every single episode. And yet, I look back on it and think &quot;oh wow they actually didn&#039;t do that badly, considering they condensed a 70-hour RPG into 25 episodes&quot;. Indeed, Devil Survivor 2: The Animation served to put Persona 4 into perspective for me. In spite of all its issues, it really didn&#039;t do that much wrong. The story was well developed, the characters all got their moments to shine, and there was still time left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104797">
        over for fluffy social linkage.<br />
<br />
Yeah, uh, DeSu 2 doesn&#039;t do any of that. What we have here is the boring parts of Mirai Nikki with the basic premise of Neon Genesis Evangelion tacked on, infused with Megami Tensei lore. P4 wasn&#039;t exactly a paragon of originality, but the tricks it played to stay above the typical worked well. Here, however, everything is strictly by-the-numbers. Chosen one, blah blah blah, pointless friends, sexy rival, blah blah blah, end of the world, boss battles, mysterious otherworldly ally, this has literally all been done before. Even worse, this show is as predictable as it is boring. I could see all the plot &quot;twists&quot; coming, -especially- the ending. Oh, wow, the ending. Don&#039;t even try to pretend you were shocked. It was so, so obvious.<br />
<br />
One of my biggest problems with this is the cast. If your name isn&#039;t Hibiki Kuze, you&#039;re shit out of luck. This show doesn&#039;t care about you, and you won&#039;t get to do anything, ever. The only other characters to get any screentime are Hibiki&#039;s two friends, his sexy rival, and the mysterious otherwordly ally. Everyone else is mere decoration, which is extremely sad, because the minor characters happen to also be the most interesting ones. I was charmed by Jungo and Airi from the first moment they appeared, but &quot;Jungo = chef, likes cats; Airi = kind of a bitch&quot; is the only thing we ever get to know about them here. This is a huge problem, because when the show starts killing characters off and treats it as a huge deal, I was unable to care. They weren&#039;t killing -people-, they were killing concepts. None of these characters were developed enough for their deaths to have any sort of impact. Speaking of development, though, not even Hibiki gets that. Indeed, his only privilege is the vast amounts of screentime. He starts the show as a generic, personality-free protagonist, and ends it the exact same way. The protagonist, Yu Narukami, was one of the things the P4 anime did extremely well, so seeing them utterly fail here was kind of sad. Perhaps 13 episodes just wasn&#039;t enough for such a large cast of characters. Wait, perhaps? There&#039;s no &quot;perhaps&quot; here.<br />
<br />
I suppose the show being short kinda starts making up for it being incredibly boring. Hey, let&#039;s be positive some more! Electropop magician kz of one-person music &quot;group&quot; livetune composed the opening, and he has, of course, delivered a total jam once again. It may not be a complete banger like his other op of the season, OreImo&#039;s Reunion, but more kz is good kz. I cherish kz&#039;s compositions. On a similar note, the ending song (Be by Song Riders) isn&#039;t bad, either. Both songs eventually found their way into my playlist, where they both got their heavy rotation. Oh and the animation is kinda nice I guess.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s have a bottom line, a line at the bottom. Devil Survivor 2 is boring. Really boring. Uninteresting and bland, even, and I can&#039;t think of this as anything other than a failure. I suppose it&#039;s a bit better than Mirai Nikki, one of my least favourite anime of all time, on account of this just being dull, as opposed to face-breakingly bad.<br />
<br />
Although, technically, isn&#039;t making a bad impact better than making no impact at all? Mirai Nikki -did- have some absolutely fantastic stupidity...<br />
<br />
Er, yeah. To close this review, I can&#039;t recommend this to anyone. To fans of the game, this is a shitty adaptation. Don&#039;t bother. To fans of the genre, Evangelion is there for a reason. To fans of SMT, just rewatch Persona 4. To everyone else, this is one boring piece of work. I suppose the best way to describe it would be &quot;mediocre&quot;, but it&#039;s -so- mediocre that it crosses into being god-awful. After all, aren&#039;t the worst shows the ones you can&#039;t even enjoy for their badness?<br />
<br />

    You know you&#039;re in for a ride when you read that first line of the synopsis and realize that the world is about to end thanks to some mysterious invaders. These invaders are called Septentriones want one thing: your life. It all takes place on the holy day of Sunday where the lives of the main characters are in danger. Why? Because the world is about to end and their only chance now is to survive. That&#039;s right....<br />
<br />
Welcome to the world of Devil Survivor 2, where survival is a word that you&#039;ll be hearing more than meets the eye.<br />
<br />
The series is based off the video

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102709">
        game, Devil Survivor 2 of the same name. It is based off of the Megami Tensei so expect some similar themes to its other products such as Persona 4. Otherwise, this series is not a sequel despite being labeled seemingly as such. Rather, Devil Survivor 2: The Animation is an animated series that brings out survival at its finest. Hmm, or does it....<br />
<br />
Taken from a survival standpoint, the series begins off with a strong promise. In fact, the subway station and the threat of being exterminated after a faithful event seemingly sets the course on its scale. It is on rail as we can tell that the mysterious invaders known as the Septentriones aren&#039;t messing around. As a matter of fact, anything coming in contact with them will likely end up a quick journey to the next world; aka death. It presents it visually well too. The way the characters panics in the beginning as well as the deaths of innocent people makes the series seem gruesome. It&#039;s not realistic but keeps up with its pace in terms of &#039;survival&#039;. It holds true to the extent of its main tagline that features two prominent words:<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s Survive.<br />
<br />
The series follows main male protagonist Hibiki Kuze. The guy is seemingly who attends a normal high school with his normal friends until that not-so-normal day. To me, the character seems just like any other typical boy with no special qualities of notice. Well, except perhaps by that distracting hood he often wears with the funny ears, he is just a student. However, it is noticeable that the boy is fearless against certain situations and is able to make crucial decisions that can potentially lead to important outcomes. Then, there are his friends Io Nitta, the school beauty who comes with a package of both brain and looks. Unfortunately, she too gets caught with the events from the beginning of the story. But hey, friends can conquer all right? Wrong. Well, not entirely they need a little help from the supernatural. This comes in the form of cell phones. If you think today&#039;s cell phones are flashy with the latest gadgets, just get a load of the ones in this series. <br />
<br />
The cell phones from this series comes with a special feature you won&#039;t find anywhere. That feature is the prominent device known as a demon APP. Luckily, this APP isn&#039;t just for decoration but an important tool to fight off the mysterious Septentriones. Thus, the APP functions as both a tool and weapon for the protagonists to use. They are able to summon demons for assistance, creatures who are not just badass looking but also packs powerful abilities that makes the characters awe of their appearances. <br />
<br />
As for the demons themselves, they seemingly serve for no other purpose other than obeying their master&#039;s commands. In other words, this isn&#039;t&#039; a friend/partner relationship between the summoners but rather as master/servant. At the same time, these demons are designed in the way that shows off how powerful they are. Take for example, Byakko the demon that Hibiki commands. He represents the ferocity of his nature through his sabertooth-like appearance. On the other hand, the Septentriones are designed to reflect their strange nature. Most of them are difficult to relate with in terms of realistic nature because of their odd appearances. They don&#039;t seem to have any personalities but rather surrounded by mystery. What we do know is that they are the executioners of mankind. Their appearances resembles otherworldly beings being perhaps comparable to Vividred Operation&#039;s Alones or Eureka Seven: AO&#039;s Secrets. In other words, they serve as the most mysterious factor of the series as they threaten the very existence of humanity.<br />
<br />
The series takes off with a good start but quickly loses its interest after its memorable first episode. The premise is easy to follow with the key word &#039;survival&#039; being a central part of the series. However, it&#039;s the pacing that causes the problem here. Unless you&#039;re a fan of the original game series, it&#039;s quick to pick out what happens and its upcoming events. Needless to say, this series follows the more of mindless fun in terms of action rather than anything serious. It&#039;s honestly hard to take this series seriously despite the given premise as well. I mean, the characters use cell phones, a tool that should be used for communication rather than summoning. In this series though, we see these kids using them as a tool of war. However, the way it employs it is rather blend. Most of the time, the kids themselves relies too much on their summonings rather than themselves. I mean, they rarely comes up with the thought of &#039;what happens if I lose my demon?&#039; It&#039;s pretty lame to see their summoners just sit back and let their partner do the job. <br />
<br />
Devil Survivor 2 does pull out some unusual events through the appearances of &#039;death clips&#039;, scenes that depicts a characters&#039; outcomes in the series. Then again, there&#039;s the Septentriones flying around causing panic to everywhere with a seemingly lack of explanation of their origins. Although it seems fun to dig clues about the series, it just seems blend through their certain appearances. As for a animated series of only 13 episodes, Devil Survivor 2 is one of those adapted anime that is crammed by its game material. This leads to problems with character development, relationships, world building, and the story itself. To make matters worse, there are even episodes where hardly anything happens but creates a setup of what&#039;s to come. It creates barriers that prevents the series to succeed in this way and doesn&#039;t help the fact that not every characters gets to shine in the spotlight.<br />
<br />
The bright side of this series though (I don&#039;t mean this literally) with its idea of survival. Characters do actually die off rather than being a tease, at least for the time being. Even the credits played after each episode presents this visually as it removes characters after they are killed. There&#039;s also an unusual relationship between Yamato and Hibiki that is hard to paint later on. Yamato is one of the most mysterious figures. Despite seeing Hibiki as a friend at times, he is also brutally honest and makes decisions with cruel outcomes. Speaking of outcomes though, the story comes out as perhaps quite weak. It&#039;s problem again lies in its adaptation of being a condensed 13-episode series. It also pulls out the deus ex machina when the opportunities come. Furthermore, it even has bits of fan service by the characters&#039; designs such as Airi and Hinako. To present material like this in a demonic series such as DS2 makes the show more messy than it already is. <br />
<br />
As for the series&#039; visuals, it represents both a gruesome nature and also one that is hard to take serious at times. Well, there&#039;s the way that Hibiki is designed along with other characters such as &#039;The Anguished One&#039;. The way the characters look doesn&#039;t make them look like survivors of anything. They look like people out of a video game. However, there are a few characters who are dressed in an unusual way that may raise a few eyebrows. Our mysterious Septentriones also are presented in a way that is completely out of this world. The apocalyptic nature of the series does fit though so I give some praise to that.<br />
<br />
Perhaps one of the stronger points of the series is the soundtrack. The OP song, “Take Your Way” takes the stance of an artistic way of presenting the series. We can see the characters digitally with enhanced features of their profiles as well as some depictions of the events. The OST is hardly noticeable though except during more of the crucial or more emotional scenes. Otherwise, the ED song as mentioned before shows the survival theme as when characters dies off, they are removed from the credits. It&#039;s all about survival people.<br />
<br />
All in all, this series is fun for some full shock violence and action. It reflects the idea of survival and gives it away immediately. However, its story is dry as paint and its cast of characters seems unbalanced with their weak development or structure. Furthermore, the series seems to be rushed and has some nonsense as it loses energy. The first episode had my eyes glued to the screen but quickly changed my mind afterwards. It&#039;s one of those series where patience is a key to getting it through. If not, then tough luck. It&#039;s just like the main characters too where they need everything to survive whether it&#039;s strategy, power, and luck. Well, for luck, they&#039;re going to need it.

    This anime seems to be getting a lot of hate but the anime itself is pretty credible and somewhat enjoyable. As someone that hasn&#039;t played the Devil Survivor games I was somewhat pulled into this anime but it still feels like it is lacking something. By reading this review I have only seen 6 episodes and so this review wouldn&#039;t be valid but can be credible to the anime itself. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is fine and there isn&#039;t too much to complain about. The anime presents itself with our usual high school protagonist with his high school friends. It&#039;s pretty basic and isn&#039;t anything new or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96601">
        ground breaking. Long version is that our main character Hibiki and friends download an app that allows him to summon demons and also see other peoples predicted deaths. The apocalypse happens and since our main character is the one with the powerful demons it&#039;s up to him to make sure no one gets killed. Pretty basic plot but watchable. <br />
<br />
Art <br />
I can&#039;t really judge artwork to me it looks pretty and there&#039;s no complaints just normal anime art style for the anime but set in 2013 standards. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound is good but the only thing I like out of sound is the opening and the ending but osts aren&#039;t memorable for me and so it doesn&#039;t have much of an impact but the opening and ending are enjoyable to listen and watch. <br />
<br />
Characters <br />
The only problem with the main character at this point is that there is no defining feature for him (except for his bunny hoodie) he&#039;s just your typical shounen character in which once he realises his power he thinks he needs to be the hero in which can protect everyone. There&#039;s nothing wrong with it as it does play in the story, who should Hibiki work for, for the greater good, the JP&#039;s or the resistance but it&#039;s just your typical shounen protagonist. The other problem is just with the side characters. I have trouble in remembering their names and Hibiki&#039;s best friend is just annoying. Overall characters aren&#039;t the best part of the show but it&#039;s still watchable. <br />
<br />
Overall as someone that has not played the game I say that the anime itself is still watchable the story itself is fine and the struggle with what the main character is going through is interesting but side characters bring the anime down but it&#039;s still watchable and I would recommend it as just an anime to watch and put on the list.<br />
<br />

    Devil Survivor 2 aired from April to June of 2013. What starts off seeming to be similar to Mirai Nikki as the characters’ cell phones are given a “future sight” ability quickly turns into a “save the world from demons” kind of show. Unfortunately, DS2 has many problems with pacing, characters, and just an overall confusing plot. It is based off of a game by the same name, which I have heard is much better.<br />
<br />
First I want to mention one thing. Whenever I say anything is bad in this show, it excludes Jungo and Airi who are two supporting characters and who are gems that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102651">
        really stand out in this mess of a show.<br />
<br />
Story – 4/10<br />
<br />
The story begins with Kuze Hibiki and Shijima Daichi, two best friends in high school who are preparing for college. One day as they are about to board the subway, a strange message comes onto their cellphones. It shows a video to them of the subway train derailing and crashing into the station they are standing on killing everyone around them. As they stand there freaked out at the video, the train comes into the station and proceeds to do exactly as the video showed. The two boys barely avoid being crushed by the crumbling station and were much more fortunate than the people around them. Still, they’re not safe yet. Strange monsters have appeared and are attacking a classmate of theirs who also happened to survive the incident, Nitta Io. Nitta and the two guys all saw the same video and all soon find out that that’s not the only thing their phones are now capable of doing. They somehow manage to fight off the monsters surrounding them by summoning demons from their phones, much to their surprise.<br />
<br />
After escaping from the subway, they learn that similar events have happened in other places. Everything starts to turn chaotic as monsters appear in the streets and start attacking. Still inexperienced with the new abilities of their phones, the three somehow manage to survive with their own strength before being found by members of an organization named “JP’s.” They learn all about the demons which are called “Septentriones” and that the world will be destroyed in a week by these Septentriones. JP&#039;s was created in order to fight the Septentriones and try to protect the world. However, the leader of JP’s, Yamato Houtsuin, seems a little untrustworthy to the trio.<br />
<br />
While I admit it is a good setup, the plot is heavily confusing. It is never explained very well what the Septentrione are and only adds more confusion later on. All I can figure is they are similar to the Angels from Evangelion (one even resembles humans). The characters jump around between sides a lot as well. By that I mean that the people surrounding Yamato never really understand his reasoning for things, and he is one of the most confusing parts of the story. The show is very indecisive on whether it wants to portray him as a villain or a hero. Yamato, while apparently trying to protect the world from the Septentriones, will use any means necessary to stop them, and he sacrifices people without showing a single ounce of regret.<br />
<br />
One last major issue is the disconnection you have with the important fighting demons of the main characters. Aside from Hibiki’s, Yamato’s and Daichi’s main demons (just one from each), I don’t remember a thing about any of the other characters demons (even Jungo and Airi’s). Having not played the DS2 game, I don’t really know how important they are, but I really wish more focus had been given to the powers and abilities of each of the demons. As similar as they are to Pokémon or the “box-weapon animals” from Katekyo Hitman Reborn, there’s just nothing in the show that helps make them memorable like in those other shows.<br />
<br />
The first two episodes of DS2 are pretty good, but from there, the story just dive-bombs lower and lower and never recovers. Even at the very final episode, I have no clue what this Polaris thing is or whether it&#039;s good or bad, and the ending itself is weak.<br />
<br />
Art – 7/10<br />
<br />
Aside from some scenes being a little too dark and difficult to follow, the art is fairly standard. While it has some great moments, the action scenes are nothing special. In addition to the poor explanations of the demons, in many cases, the characters send them out to fight and then the story focuses on the drama between Yamato, Hibiki, and everyone else instead of showing the action in detail. The character designs (excluding Jungo and Airi) are not very original. There’s one woman, Hinako, who kind of takes a motherly towards Nitta and the other characters. Her design (which I really did not like) is just bizarre as I have no idea how the two flaps that are her shirt stay on her breasts.<br />
<br />
Sound – 6/10<br />
<br />
I noticed in Episode 12 that there were a few great songs playing during the action scenes, but other than that I hardly noticed the music at all. The voice actors for the most part are decent at best. Daichi’s voice is really annoying, but at least the VA cast has Sawashiro Miyuki as Makoto who is one of my favorite voice actors (she also voices Celty in Durarara!!). I also found Hibiki’s voice to be sub-par for a main protagonist. As much emotion as he shows, he never really sounded the part to me during those scenes.<br />
<br />
Character – 5/10<br />
<br />
This would probably be a 3/10 if not for Jungo and Airi. Despite being supporting characters who are not even introduced until around episode four or five, to me Jungo and Airi were really the best characters in DS2. Their relationship was more of a big brother (Jungo) and little sister (Airi) relationship than anything romantic. Jungo is a fairly quiet, tall man while Airi is kind of a brat who talks a lot and gets embarrassed easily. When I first saw them, I thought they were kind of similar to Jesse and James from Pokémon (they’re first seen sneaking into a rebel building), but they quickly show that they are much more than that. Like every other named character in this show, they have cellphones which can summon demons to fight.<br />
<br />
Now onto the main cast. The main cast greatly resembles the cast of Durarara!! (main trio who look very similar, long-time rivals, and Makoto and Celty have the same VA and similar roles). I thought Hibiki was a pretty weak and stereotypical protagonist. He’s thrust into a supernatural world he doesn’t understand with an unusual amount of power and he is basically forced to save the world with said power. Daichi is just annoying. He’s Hibiki’s best friend who can only summon small useless demons at first. Nitta is a girl who has trouble comprehending everything at first as she is thrust into this world while worrying about her family. She also has a strong desire to protect everyone. I already talked about Yamato so now I’ll talk about his “rival” who he has known for years, Alcor (Ureu Mono). Alcor is a Septentrione who has the form of a human (though what’s up with his huge white eyelashes?). He is interested in Hibiki and wants to help him save the world (I think, like Yamato, Alcor’s motives are a little confusing).<br />
<br />
One thing about this show (which you’ll notice as you watch the ED after a few episodes) is that it is not afraid to kill characters. I already mentioned that Yamato sacrifices people (tens of background characters get wiped out from a single attack from Septentriones many times), but this show does not give you much time to grow attached to a few characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment – 5/10<br />
<br />
I just barely enjoyed it enough to finish all 13 episodes. To me, this show is a butchered mix between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Mirai Nikki for the plot and Durarara!! for the characters. It’s confusing, only has two strong characters with a weak main cast, and does not even have the art or sound to really back up these huge faults.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+ Jungo and Airi<br />
+ The first two episodes are not bad<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Weak main characters<br />
- Confusing plot<br />
- Music is never very strong<br />
- Weak action scenes<br />
- Demons are forgettable due to lack of screen time<br />
<br />
I would recommend avoiding this anime. Similar things such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and the Yumekui Merry manga did the “save the world from mysterious creatures” concept better, and I would recommend them over DS2.

    Overall the anime was good I enjoyed it, I watched it in one day which may skew my perception of it.  Probably if I had to wait week by week for this anime I would have dropped it at episode 3.  I do not know anything about the game, nor did I read the synopsis of the anime beforehand, so I had no expectations.<br />
<br />
Story (7/10) The story was very shounen like, if I could compare it, the 13 episodes seemed fairly similar to a first arc in a shounen manga.  The characters are introduced, the main character is more awesome that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103423">
        others, and has to rise to the occasion to battle it out against the &quot;evil&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Art (7/10) The characters were pleasing to the eye.  There were alot of scenes in which spoke volumes in terms of the story.  While Alcor and Hibiki are talking on the bridge the scene of the void taking over was pretty meaningful especially with the dialogue.  The fights in episode 10-13 were a bit different.  I felt like some of the fights were reminiscent of Neon Genesis and also GANTZ. <br />
<br />
Sound (8/10) I am just rating this on feelings.  I liked the theme song a lot.  The ending songs were okay, but I didn&#039;t listen to them every episode or anything.  The sound during the anime was good, although I am not an elite on sound, so I wouldn&#039;t be sure.<br />
<br />
Characters (8/10) I really feel Hibiki, Daichi, Io were lacking in this series as far characterization goes.  We get a flashback of the reason why Hibiki is such a do-gooder, but the director I feel did not direct it properly because it did not come off as either sentimental or that you knew more about the person.  You just came away with the feeling that he use to go with the flow of his parents expectations than one day his friend was talking about what he wanted to do in high school and BAM he changed? I don&#039;t get it. Io is the archetypical girl that you feel sorry for and gets lured into traps etc so the main character can create a miracle for her (she doesn&#039;t cry that much though so that&#039;s good).  Daichi well what can I say he is like the idiot friend that has good intentions but is just not as strong or intelligent as the main and merely becomes comedic relief.  The other characters are better, Alcor was by far the most interesting.  Some of the characters I felt were purely fan service and could have been done away with, though I am sure they appeared in the game so they had to be included.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed it, I think it was good that it was not made into a 24 episodes.  In fact I think it would have been better as movie or 3 part OVA.  Since there are 13 episodes I expected more either character development or fight scenes, but instead air time was wasted on useless character to character dialogue on food or building up supporting characters like the Airi and Jungo, and the person with barely there clothing.  While fans of the game probably liked this, I thought it was worthless and had no point in anime adaptation.  I also liked the philosophical aspect of it, I felt that it could have been done better rather than spelling it out, it could have been symbolic but, I guess it fits shounen-like genre to spell it out for people.<br />

    This is a great series, people need to understand Shin Megami Tensei is a non-casual and non-mainstream rpg series. <br />
<br />
This was clearly made for fans of the SMT saga. But it is still enjoyable for people who actually want an anime that doesn&#039;t revolve around Friendship Power &gt; everything. The characters are varied and likable but that&#039;s not what the anime is about.<br />
<br />
This anime is about a group of NORMAL teenagers who end up involved in an Apocalyptic survival of the fittest scenario. This is a realistic what-if series.<br />
-What if demons suddenly appeared in your city? <br />
-What if you had an app on your phone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98401">
        to summon demons?<br />
-What if you were given a chance to change the world?<br />
-What if you saw a clip of your friends death and he&#039;s standing right next to you?<br />
<br />
Dropping this anime because you don&#039;t have all the answers before episode 4 is just silly. Watch the series if you want answers.<br />

    Well,this anime has it all. Lame story(basically nonexistent, its just one boss figth after another),boring characters, with no motivation, no interest and no development and mediocre music thah really wears off after one time. Even the animation, its strongest aspect, its nothing special and you can not even enjoy it because is lost from all the stupidity of the above.<br />
<br />
However, that its not this anime&#039;s biggest problem.The thing that really bugged me it is the fact the show never escapes from its gaming origin. It keeps remind you that its a game: the hero receives quests from the director, performs them and then returns for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96519">
        more. The graphics, the pauses(which by the way are just plain stupid), even the opening, they all feel like i am playing a computer game. Even the title for god&#039;s shake!I do not have a problem with animes that come from games, i even love some of them, but it becomes a problem when the staff just want to animate a game and simply do not care about anything else. The Devil Survivor 2 The animation is an anime for those that wanted to see the game animated and NOONE ELSE.Maybe not even them.<br />
<br />
overall i give it a 3,a poor choice to watch.

    I picked up Devil Survivor 2 because the summary sounded interesting and not because I&#039;ve played the game it is supposed to be adapted off of. The series is similar to Mirai Nikki and the two Persona adaptations. Unlike said series the plot of DS2 doesn&#039;t flow well at all, so I know the problem doesn&#039;t lie with it being an adaption off a game, particularly since both Persona adaptations turned out well despite being a game. I&#039;ve also seen a few other series with a similar plot line and I was quite fond of said series. This though I was not, and that is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102671">
        not a reflection on the game at all.<br />
<br />
Going into the series I didn&#039;t realize that the series&#039; plot line involved tricking fate, but after the first episode I knew that it shared a similar plot line as quite a few other series I had seen involving tricking fate. The problem is, unlike the other series the characters are not actually able to trick fate and everything turns into an over blown blood fest with no sense of direction. Interesting characters would appear, only to be killed off shortly after they appeared, thus there was no getting to know said characters beyond the basic quirks that they were shown to have in the series.<br />
<br />
The plot line was also overly depressing as was the ending. My enjoyment for the series had been high at the beginning, but quickly dropped as the series progressed. It felt like the show was missing something and over all it was very bland. The art work and sound really were the only thing going for this series.

    I&#039;m a fan of Atlus games as well, including Devil Survivor series. What I like in the second game, is that it is more light-hearted than the first one. The first one is the exact definition of horror. I still love the first one though.<br />
<br />
Story 7, Art 8, Sound 9, Chara 6, Enjoy 8, Overall 8<br />
<br />
The story is quite simple, so I won&#039;t comment much. What I like about the story in the anime and the game, is because the anime diverts itself from the game. Lots of different dead clips and events differ very much. I actually like that, since it makes me wonder

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100121">
        who&#039;s gonna die next, and what kind of ending will take place.<br />
<br />
The art is good. It is so very like &quot;2013&quot;-ish. I like Suzuhito Yasuda from Durarara!!, so I can enjoy the art.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really pay attention to the sound, but I love the opening and the ending.<br />
<br />
Characters are usually the main reasons I watched an anime. Aside from art. The characters don&#039;t develop that much, and I must say that I was quite disappointed by the developments. Hibiki&#039;s actions are actually from your typical shounen protagonists. Though I can relate and forgive it, since I thought his actions are perfectly normal for a normal high school students who were suddenly brought to the end of the world. <br />
<br />
Still, because I&#039;m an ATLUS fan, I can&#039;t stop watching this anime.<br />
<br />
I would&#039;ve put the overall as 7.5, since the core point of the anime was struck down.<br />
<br />
As a bonus, I finally realized that this anime is actually very interesting. You need to watch this further deeper into the episodes to know its quality. I admit, that the few first episodes are utterly disappointing. But I can&#039;t say that again to the later episodes. It&#039;s getting more and more interesting.

    booooringgg. the first episode was quite enjoyable and i had quite the expectations for this series. the intro and outro were also quite good, so my initial  impression was quite high. however, the coming episodes (i&#039;ve watched 6 so far) have led the anime astray and I&#039;m left with easily predictable scenes and cheesy dialogue that bores me like no other anime. since the first episode my impression for this anime has exponentially dropped and unfortunately, I don&#039;t see it getting much better. 6/10

    I&#039;m playing the game while watching the animation just to compare them and the two can&#039;t even be compared. The reason for the 5 on the story is that the anime feels so rushed. I know it is 24 episodes but they could have filled those episodes with the &quot;conversations&quot; the protagonist has with various characters from the anime. And worse, the animators just keep killing off the various characters that I find interesting like Otome who loves teasing Makoto about her &quot;crush&quot; on the protagonist, Joe who is so whimsical, it makes the gameplay fun, and Keita who is such a lone wolf he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98491">
        is funny. Not only that, some characters are so out of OOC like Yamato who is cynical and sarcastic instead of being a total grunting guy, Fumi who is suppose to be crazy, and the protagonist who is suppose to be cool instead of a normal guy. The biggest fail is the character deaths because each character is awesome with a lot put into them so killing them off with no character development is just stupid, especially considering the fact that fans of the game will definitely watch this and will hate it for destroying their hopes. The fight scenes are too short and superficial, and the characters don&#039;t seem to be able to learn demon powers, which is a turn-off. The graphics and animation itself is good but that can only improve the anime by so much. All in all, not really satisfying but watch it if you like.

    When the preview for this anime came out, I practically fangirled like crazy because I played the game version of this. I actually didn&#039;t finish it because I didn&#039;t like spoilers, so I decided to finish the anime before I continue playing. I seriously thought it would be awesome. The first game was pretty nice and I expected the anime of the second game to be just as good. BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. Most of the characters were lame, story was predictable, and everything was just plain boring. Seriously, Hibiki&#039;s actions are SUUUUUPPPERRRR predictable, I had to fast forward the anime just so I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97771">
        can see if I&#039;m right. And I was. Boy was I let down.<br />
<br />
They should&#039;ve animated the first one instead. The storyline and premise were better in DS1. It got the &quot;survivor&quot; part quite well and it was also much darker than DS2.<br />
<br />
Gave it a 5 because OP and ED were cool.

    Oh man, going into this anime I honesty had high hopes. I really should have known better.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The start of the anime was pretty good. It starts with two normal high school living their normal lives, while going to someplace somewhere to do something they see a beautiful girl by herself. While talking about her, they get a video showing their own deaths and the show begins. It starts somewhat strong and interesting but as the story continues it starts making less sense and becomes extremely boring to watch. <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
All the characters are bland and weak except for Hibiki (he&#039;s boring, just not weak) the protagonist.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143043">
        All other characters play unimportant roles (except for the guys with white hair), HECK the other two that were with Hibiki were only there to try and be characters who the audience could sympathize with and to be a &quot;reason&quot; for the protagonist to fight. Hibiki is honestly no better than any other character, the only reason why he&#039;s more likeable than the others is he&#039;s strong and the others aren&#039;t. He&#039;s the VERY DEFINITION of a generic main character, but hey it is a game adaptation.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound<br />
The only thing that saves this anime is it&#039;s good art and animation. The characters look nice and the battles are nicely animated but very boring to watch after the first few fights. The music didn&#039;t really stand out much except for the ending.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I really forced myself to watch this anime often going into a trance like state causing me to miss most of what happened in the current episode.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I really forced myself to watch this anime often going into a trance like state causing me to miss most of what happened in the episode. This is a really big reason why I try my best to not get hyped for anything (I still don&#039;t know why I was even hyped for this anime).<br />

    I am in love with this anime at the moment! The use of supernatural powers and the characters who are so easy to fall in love with. The story line is like a breath of fresh air and its not too difficult to follow as the events unfold. <br />
<br />
To begin with i assumed it would be yet another predictable anime but as each episode is aired something unexpected turns out. There is a strong theme of power and hierarchy, although it is not overwhelming as it has the portrayal that the power would be easily taken away.  <br />
<br />
This anime is one that you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101177">
        fall into, you lose yourself in the story and it&#039;s not very often that an anime can actually do that for me. As the anime spans out over seven days it is very short but not lacking when it comes to action, not only that but the feeling of self sacrifice is almost overpowering, but it is a brilliant anime. I recommend this to anybody who enjoys action packed animes.

    Devil Survivor 2 is an adaptation of the game developed by Atlus. Opinions about this anime will be different from person to person <br />
<br />
This review shall be made taking into account the game, I played it long before seeing this adaptation.<br />
<br />
The anime had potential to become one of the best of this year 2013 if the creators had taken more seriously the game, in my opinion i believe that neither they played it and only guided themselves by summaries of the game (who knows? Seems like it to me).<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start by comparing the anime and the game in several areas:<br />
<br />
Story: The story in this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review109579">
        goes way too fast.<br />
The game had many missions that didn&#039;t belong to the main story but that affected the course of history and all of them were not shown in this animation.<br />
The anime is just 13 episodes and that affected the character/character development and the moste important, the finale ! I would not mind if the anime had 2 seasons if that meant covering all parts of the game.<br />
I still don&#039;t believe they skipped the battle beetwen Hibiki and Polaris (major flaw!).<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters are not well developed and some even only appear in 2 or 3 episodes and the relationships between some are a bit forced due to the reduced number of episodes. In the game, you have the opportunity to socialize and get to know better each character and their problems and their life before the invasion but the reduced number of episodes made it impossible.<br />
<br />
Sound: In my opinion the soundtrack from the anime meets the recommended and has a great ending (better ending in this summer for me), as well as the OST fits well.<br />
<br />
Battles: The battles in this anime were good but could have been more and better, if the anime had traversed the whole game we would have the opportunity to see more demons and various attacks.<br />
<br />
The final battle (i do not want to spoil) is too short in my opinion and could have more drama and more action.<br />
<br />
The games of the saga shin megami tensei are famous for having a great story to develop and its interaction with all the characters and addictive battles but the anime was slightly below expectations but i disagree when people say it was a failure because i found it nice to see one my favorite games adapted for television.<br />
<br />
Who knows  if they do not make the adaptation of the first game Devil Survivor, but this time done by taking better account of the game.<br />
<br />
I hope this review helped you in some way and always remeber :<br />
<br />
LET&#039;S SURVIVE !

Furthermore, I could not avoid comparing this to the game. Still, I reviewed this on its own merits. I have played Devil Survivor 2: Record Breaker for the 3DS for 100+ hours, so I have a good grasp on the game’s strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
I’ve sometimes wondered why Shin Megami Tensei games don’t get adaptations, but then a bit of thinking always leads me to the answer: many of them would be the same. See, since the core SMT series typically boasts multiple endings, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190932">
        studio would have to adapt one, and the one it chooses to adapt would be the Neutral route, as that would probably have the most story. This is why we see more linear games (plotwise) like Persona 4 get adaptations. Devil Survivor 2, the second in the Devil Survivor branch of SMT games, has a tone right in between SMT and Persona. The game is considerably more lighthearted than its parent series and its predecessor, and even though it has multiple routes, they’re very similar to each other. So, how does the anime adaptation work out? Not well, I’m afraid.<br />
<br />
Devil Survivor 2 the Animation is based on a manga that is based on the game. It follows the main character, renamed Hibiki Kuze, a bunny-eared hoodie wearing high schooler. After signing up for a macabre site, Nicaea, that promises to show death videos, or clips of people dying, the world seems to turn upside down; a subway train crashes, monsters only describable as demons pop out of peoples phones, and mysterious invaders called the Septentriones threaten the balance of the world itself. Hibiki, who has a greater potential than others, can summon stronger demons like Byakko; as a result, he and his friends are forcibly enlisted into the government agency JP’s (pronounced Jips) to fight against these monsters. Hibiki often comes into conflict with the cold and ruthless leader of JP’s, Yamato Hotsuin. He also comes into contact with a number of different people, most noticeably the Anguished One, an enigmatic being who knows more than he’s letting on and is decidedly not human.<br />
<br />
The plot of the original game was never its strong suit (with plenty of dumb anime tropes and stuff like &quot;The Dragon Stream&quot;), and for the most part, the anime doesn’t strengthen it. Urgency and despair are rarely felt, despite it being a Shin Megami Tensei title; honestly, this doesn’t play out as anything other than a disaster-based anime, much like films such as Twister and San Andreas. Where the game did excel, however, was with its characters. A total of 14 main characters rounded out a robust cast in the game, and each character had enough time to be fleshed out. Even Hibiki bucked the trend by being a rather witty hero, calling people tsundere, nicknaming them, and flirting with everyone to no end. The cast was creative.<br />
<br />
The anime doesn’t do that. Almost every character is reduced to a singular trait or trope, or even less so. <br />
<br />
Daichi? Good friend of Hibiki, and dumb comic relief (A recurring gag has him yelling &quot;My Demons are weak!&quot; which gets old fast). <br />
Io? Dandere who seems to like Hibiki. <br />
Makoto? Serious. <br />
Fumi? Uncaring.<br />
Ronaldo? Justice. <br />
<br />
Characters like Joe, Otome, Airi, Jungo, Hinako, and Keita don’t even get an iota of development to make you give half a shit about them. Joe&#039;s a guy, Otome&#039;s a doctor, Hinako dances, whatever. Not a shred of their personality or motivations are retained from the game. The most we get is maybe one or two stills (quite literally stills, not even a scene) worth of flashback for Airi and a short scene for Makoto. Hibiki might be one of the worst off; after having such a creative personality in the game, and then having the voice actor to be able to match (Hiroshi Kamiya, who also did the manic Araragi from the Monogatari series). Hibiki is reduced to nothing more than a serious shounen hero who wants to save everyone. Hooray for a generic hero. <br />
<br />
And, well, it also doesn’t really help that pretty much everyone dies in an extremely haphazard manner. In the game, Death Videos were supposed to be avoided by arriving in a timely fashion. And while the game had time to let you feel the weight of your incompetence, no such element exists in the anime other than Hibiki beating himself about it, as you can&#039;t connect to many, if any, of the characters. In one of the early episodes, the character Keita is introduced, only to die in that same episode. The end of the series gets particularly dumb, when pretty much everyone dies in rapid succession.<br />
<br />
(Incidentally, during a fight with the Anguished One, Yamato avoids getting killed. Somehow. Despite being exploded upon. Never explained.)<br />
<br />
As far as characterization goes, it’s not an entire wash. The Anguished One is roughly the same as his game counterpart, but the clear “winner” is definitely Yamato, who’s roughly the same as he is in the game. However, he’s significantly more ruthless in this anime than he is in the game, and that produces mixed results. On the one hand, Yamato is permitted extra development even over the game, especially through his childhood and his interactions with politicians that led him to his meritocracy beliefs. On the other hand, Yamato is hard to sympathize with on almost any level; the game, which allowed you to join him in his quest for a meritocracy, included a few light moments, made him a much less “evil” character than he is in the anime. <br />
<br />
It’s because of this overall weak characterization that prevents the extremely talented voice cast from reaching their full potential. There’s a dynamite Japanese voice cast featuring a very strong list of A-list seiyuus, but bland characters can’t really be saved by good voice acting. No one performance is bad (far from it!), but the only one who stands out is Junichi Suwabe as Yamato, even if his great performance only serves to make Yamato more unlikable. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, all of this can be attributed to rushing, only highlighting the plot points. A playthrough of a route, even quickly, can take around 15 hours, and while not all of that is plot all the time, everything feels stuffed into this 6 and a half hour adaptation which focuses only on the major plot points. If I had to appreciate the plot in any way (besides them somehow paying a lot of attention to the fusion recipes: they were all correct!) it would be the fight with Lugh, which was much plainer in the game.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, we have some strong animation here. Maybe after seeing a bunch of semi-static sprites all of the time in the game lowered my standards, but the animation is always clean and consistent. A-1 manages to make the demons look terrifying, and the character models by Durarara!! and Danmachi artist Suzuhito Yasuda are brought to life here, with a focus on details. While other aspects of the anime may be suspect, Seiji Kishi does a great job of directing this series, and the cinematography is quite well done. <br />
<br />
The fight scenes are a mixed bag, much like the Persona 4 animation; like that, it feels like glorified Pokemon, which is definitely not what Shin Megami Tensei is. To its credit, the fight scenes look pretty enough, but their length, choreography, and character interactions (which is mostly reduced to yelling stuff like “Go Byakko!”) leaves plenty to be desired.<br />
<br />
You shouldn’t have much of a reason, if any at all, to watch this anime unless you’ve played the game (or fall into a group where you don’t own a 3DS but like the SMT and Persona series). Maybe for morbid curiosity, but not much else. My main reason to watch this was to experience the Japanese cast, which is unavailable to me unless I buy a Japanese 3DS and a Japanese version of Record Breaker, but thanks to the uninspired characters, even that isn’t a good enough reason. I’d recommend you skip this series. It has its strengths, but its weaknesses far outstrip them. But buy Record Breaker if you have a 3DS.<br />

    Devil Survivor 2: Dubious Massacre Too<br />
<br />
After Seiji Kishi&#039;s wildly successful anime adaptation of Persona 4, it was only natural we would see him tackle another popular Atlus video game franchise, right? That&#039;s what we got with Devil Survivor 2, a 13 episode series produced by a relative unknown in the anime industry, Studio Bridge. Considering the success Kishi had with Persona 4, we could expect the same great things with Devil Survivor 2...ah expectations...how you never cease to fail me.<br />
<br />
This series is the very definition of the phrase &quot;all style and no substance.&quot; Devil Survivor 2 is a GORGEOUSLY animated series with production values through

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102679">
        the roof. However, Kishi faces the same problem he had with Angel Beats...he tried to cram way too much into too little of space. Devil Survivor 2 is supposed to be a character driven series with well fleshed out characters to drive a dark, horrifically bleak plot. However, since Kishi only had 13 episodes to work with, this series felt rushed in its character development (or lack there of) and it resulted in the series not having the &quot;impact&quot; it should&#039;ve had. I will warn you right now (as if you couldn&#039;t tell from the title), there is a lot of death in this series. However, like I stated, due to the characters not being fleshed out, their deaths have very little impact, at least not as much impact as they should&#039;ve had. <br />
<br />
As far as the story is concerned, it revolves around a graduating high school student named Hibiki Kuze, who is hanging out with his best friend Daichi Shijima after college entrance exams. While hanging out, Daichi shows Hibiki a phone app that shows people their faces when they die. While waiting for their ride in the subway, they encounter a girl from another class named Io Nitta, someone Daichi has a crush on. While waiting for their ride, they all get messages of their dead face clip of the train derailing and killing all of them, and all given the choice by the app if they want to live or die. By choosing to live, they avoid a near death experience when the train does derail, but their worlds will never be the same after this event as they discover that the end of the world is at hand and they&#039;ll have to fight to survive. Overall, I did find it to be an interesting plot that at least kept me interested in how this world was coming to an end. However, in my opinion, a story is only as good as the characters that drive it...and that&#039;s where this series took a turn for the worst.<br />
<br />
The characters were so underdeveloped that it was sad. While I don&#039;t think the cast nor the characters themselves were necessarily terrible or unlikable, the problem was ALL of them were underdeveloped. After the first few episodes, Kishi gives us the impression that we need to be invested in Hibiki, Nitta, and Daich and their growing friendshipi. However, other than learning about all three of them trying to get into college, we learn next to nothing about them. We don&#039;t learn anything about what shaped their personalities or their motivations, and other than a short flashback later on in the series, there is absolutely nothing displayed about Hibiki&#039;s back story. That&#039;s where the problem with this series lies. The nature of Shin Megami Tensei games for the most part, is the choices you make to develop your character. However, when you have a contained anime series, the choices need to be made by the production staff...but in this instance, Kishi didn&#039;t make any choices and left the characters open for the viewer to make their own interpretation about them. That sort of practice works fine for a video game, but not when you&#039;re telling a story, especially in an anime series format. It was an odd choice because in Kishi&#039;s prior work (Persona 4), Yu Narukami, the series lead was fleshed out and the production staff did choose how to develop him. I&#039;d say this is one instance where Kishi should&#039;ve followed his own prior example. While I mentioned it earlier, this series had way too many notable characters to completely cover in a 13 episode format. There were 14 notable characters that were either main characters or incredibly important supporting characters. However, when you only have 13 episodes to work with, it&#039;s impossible to flesh out every single one and when you have a story as active as this one, there just wasn&#039;t enough time to cover both bases. I&#039;ll give this series a little bit of credit though. Alcor was one hell of a memorable character due to his bizarre appearance and unorthodox behavior...but even that feels like a drag considering how forgettable all the rest of the characters are.<br />
<br />
The MAJOR saving grace for this series should come as no surprise. It&#039;s the animation and music. The production value of this series was incredible. The animation was crisp and provided a dreary setting and the high-quality music provided a bleak mood (even if the characters didn&#039;t). While this series only had 13 episodes to work with, I&#039;ll at least admit Studio Bridge went all out with it. I found the demon designs and the fight scenes to be incredibly fascinating and certainly does justice to the wonderful universe Shin Megami Tensei has to offer. My one complaint (albeit minor) is I found the character designs, primarily the costume designs, to be rather silly for a series of this magnitude. While I know it&#039;s probably derived from the series directly, I found some of the character costumes to be downright hilarious, from Kuze&#039;s rabbit eared hoodie, to Hinako&#039;s breast flop top, to Fumi&#039;s swimsuit with a full-length cape. It&#039;s pretty sad when a series this ominous can make you chuckle from just mere costume designs.<br />
<br />
All-in-all, I can&#039;t help but feel disappointed by this series. This was one series I was looking forward to the most when this season started and it left me feeling discontent. When a character driven series has really shallow character development, you have problems. It&#039;s just hard to get invested in a series where there is such little development between the characters throughout. I will say this series did have a pretty strong finish with its last two episodes, however, by then, the damage was done. While I thought the final episode was a strong finish to a weak series, some people might get a little turned off by its Mai-Hime-esque conclusion. I&#039;m not sure how this series works as an adaptation since I&#039;ve never played the video game, but as an anime series, it failed to deliver in a lot of ways. Now, the question is, who would I recommend this to? Well, I&#039;d say if you liked other video game adapted or inspired anime like Persona 4 or Persona: Trinity Soul, you might enjoy this. However, a viewer that loves being invested in character over plot is more than likely going to find this to be a difficult watch. I hate to say it, but I have a feeling that I&#039;m going to say by the end of the year that Devil Survivor 2 was unfortunately one of the more disappointing anime of 2013.

Let&#039;s start with the story. Personally, I love apocalypse-themed stories. Devil Survivor 2 gives you that feeling. Who will survive, will you be dead or alive. Though not much thrill as expected, it&#039;s still good enough. The plot twists are awesome! Rating: 7<br />

Art. The art is SMT-styled. The characters don&#039;t look like each other - unlike some animes with characters that resemble someone else. I love how they animated the demon summoning and things. Gotta love the flying ice-cream. Rating: 8<br />
<br />
Sound. Oh my Gosh. The OP and ED themes are awesome! Them right

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108913">
        it is! And when a character dies, they&#039;re stripped off the ED. And the soundtrack just fits the anime well. Rating: 9<br />
<br />
Character. Hibiki is the typical Ash-like protagonist. I&#039;ll protect you blah blah blah. They should&#039;ve made him more awesome-er and funnier. Yamato is made more evil and Hibiki made more cliche. I hate how they messed with the characters. Oh, and Io is supposed to be more shy. Rating: 5<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. I don&#039;t really recall some &#039;fanatic&#039; moment with me and the anime. Let&#039;s just say we just want to watch how it ends. Enjoyment is fair. Rating: 6<br />
<br />
Overall Rating: 7<br />
The story, art and sound are awesome. Characters are messed with, boo. Enjoyment, really not much. But you have to admit, we all want Hibiki&#039;s jacket.<br />
