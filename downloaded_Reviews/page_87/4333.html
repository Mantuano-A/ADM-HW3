    &quot;Koisuru Asteroid&quot; is one of those anime than unless you&#039;re interested on its subject matter you won&#039;t be liking it as much as you&#039;d want to. What if I told you that&#039;s not always the case. What if I told you that the characters could make the story rather the aforementioned &quot;subject matter&quot;? &quot;Koisuru Asteroid&quot; is certainly one of those anime, and I&#039;ll prove it to you.<br />
<br />
Yes, because the characters are so likable it makes me ignore the fact i&#039;ve never been interested in astronomy. It&#039;s fascinating because throughout the anime I learned so much about something that it never mattered to me and all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333053">
        this thanks to its characters interaction, which I have to say, it&#039;s actually hilarious. They somehow make it possible to be hilarious and at the same time, explain further the astronomy. I actually did some research and whoever wrote the script did a good job of explaining things in the best way possible. It&#039;s not confusing to say the least and the comedy makes it better. I&#039;ll be honest, if it was a serious show i would have probably dropped it long time ago, and while I like it when something is serious, some things have to be hilarious, otherwise it wouldn&#039;t work as it should.<br />
<br />
The story is also nice even though sometimes it feels like most of it is filler and does not progress the story. This has mainly to do with the amount of characters and the fact it&#039;s set at school. Considering the amount of characters, lets very little to development but I don&#039;t think it wouldn&#039;t matter that much since the story is plot-triven rather than character-driven. The main point of the anime was explained extremely well and that&#039;s what matters in the most. Everything else irrelevant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Koisuru Asteroid&quot; is clearly not for everyone... in fact I dare to say it&#039;s just for a group of people but if you ever wondering if it&#039;s worth watching then my answer would be... thoroughly. Watch it at least for the characters as they&#039;re so damn lovely.

    Among the various Anime released in January 2020, is one of the studios that is fairly solid in its adaptation.  Namely, Doga Kobo with his new title &quot;Koisuru Shouwakusei&quot; The thing that made him &#039;different&#039; from others was not only having a unique storyline, but also in terms of the graphic design that was displayed when it was really &#039;different&#039;.<br />
<br />
I do not understand in here. You all manipulated the score, as if you forbid anyone else to watch this. I say this is a good anime, why because there are several factors that influence why this anime can be good. The many scenes of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333052">
        astromomical explanation, which I find easy to understand. in addition, their struggle to reach their ideals is exemplary and motivating, and much more.<br />
<br />
It was when we were kids.<br />
&quot;Watashitachi ga kodomo no koro&quot; is the one word that appeared at the beginning of the promotional video of this Koisuru Shouwakusei anime.  Koisiru Shouwakusei described a woman named Mira Konohata, who was a student from Hoshizaki High School.  Because when she was little, Mira met someone named Ao Manaka, their meeting there when he was little made Mira a little interested in things related to space.<br />
<br />
One day, when Mira went to see the club at her school, and coincidentally met with Ao Manaka.  After their meeting, starting from here the story of Koisuru Shouwakusei begins ...<br />
<br />
Great music.<br />
Music in an Anime is something that cannot be separated.  Because this also affects the development of the atmosphere in the story.  Koisuru Shouwakusei can be called presenting music that is &#039;just right&#039; even if in personal opinion this is exceptionally great music.  As if this music was made not for the Anime itself, but the Anime follows the music.  But everyone&#039;s opinions must be different, but the music presented in Koisuru Shouwakusei is very fitting in building the atmosphere and portraying the image of this Anime itself.<br />
<br />
Graphic.<br />
This is probably one of the main factors that makes people interested in watching this anime.  The illustrations in Koisuru Shouwakusei are very different from the illustrations used in anime in general.  Koisuru Shouwakusei is indeed not the first time, but after all this time, flooded with sharing the title of Anime maybe Koisuru Shouwakusei has the most prominent illustration.  The background image is no less extraordinary.  Maybe this is what is called realistic art.  But even though the character&#039;s illustration and background are somewhat extraordinary, this is not followed by the expression of each character.  Also, the amount of CG that I feel is still lacking to explain the story.  So we are required to read the subtitles carefully if we want to understand the situation clearly.<br />
<br />
Stepping Forward, Towards Dreams.<br />
&quot;If you have the chance to repeat everything from the beginning, do you choose to stay the way you are, or choose to change even though there is no guarantee that it will work?&quot;  asteroids that they find based on their desires. Will Mira and Ao be able to find the asteroid?  Actually the possibilities are endless, so hope as high as possible because someday that desire will become a prayer and will come true.

    A back-to-basics Doga Kobo cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime has the pleasure to show us the wonders of the universe, precisely asteroids, along with a healthy small dose of the wonders of geology, and in classical Doga Kobo, a small quantity of yuri subtext (English name is Asteroid in Love). Your astrological chart says that you&#039;ll read spoilers, so you&#039;re warned. <br />
<br />
When a little girl called Mira Konohata meets little boy Ao Manaka, they promised each other to discover a new asteroid when older. In the present, teenage Mira joints the Astronomy Club, where she meets teenage Ao, who is actually a girl, and along with Mai Inose,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333398">
        Mikage Sakurai and Mari Morino, they start their adventures exploring the wonders of the Earth and the Universe.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10):<br />
Mira Konohata is a passionate girl on the universe, astronomy, and specially, asteroids; such is her fanatism on asteroids that she made a promise in a camp with a young person with short hair called Ao Manaka that they&#039;ll do anything to discover together a new asteroid in a foreseeable future. A few years later, Mira enters high school and wants to join the Astronomy Club, but it was merged with the Geology Club to form the Earth Sciences Club, there she meets a purple haired girl named Ao Manaka, much to the surprise of the asteroid.<br />
<br />
We can&#039;t also forget our ample cast of girls, the calm Mai Inose, or Ino-senpai; the elegant president Mari Morino, or Monroe-senpai; and the playful vicepres Mikage Sakurai, Sakura-senpai. Since their specialties are varied and their clubs forced merging put them into a difficult position to get funds, the chemistry between the girls help them overcome it.<br />
<br />
Maintaining the traditional structure of Doga Kobo cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime like beach episodes, school festivals, the most remarkable aspect of Asteroid in Love is the soft talk to explain very complicated themes like the parts of a telescope, the celestial sphere, identification of planets by the naked eye, and sometimes the types of rocks, boring, core sampling, strata analysis, ironically, one of the themes that I majored. <br />
<br />
This is in contrast of the hard-hitting content of RikeKoi, whose themes are much more complicated and are explained very technically that can repel the less educated, while Science-Types fell in love with extreme theoretical jargon. Asteroid is in love with a much more forgiving detail telling to our minds.<br />
<br />
Later in the show, new girls appear after the graduation of Monroe and Sakura, Mikage&#039;s sister Chikage, or Chika-chan, who shares her geology love with her sister, but also can read the fortunes of the girls with rocks, called geomancy; and the rough second year Yuu Nanami, or Nana-chan, whose theme is not astronomy nor geology, rather meteorology, a science that is rarely interesting for the normal people, but she&#039;s not normal, so she likes it.<br />
<br />
Mira and Ao&#039;s relationship began normally and started evolving so much that Manaka, after a deep-searching discussion with her family, went to live with her fellow asteroid lover in order to fulfill their dream together. Their common dream made them write an essay about asteroids in order to qualify to an event to actually watch asteroids, in which only Mira qualifies to the final course. Of course Doga Kobo, using all its vast experience on inserting yuri subtext on CGDCT anime, tell us that Ao is indeed in love with the Asteroid girl.<br />
<br />
The Shining Star Challenge consisted in analyzing live-time the asteroids in Okinawa as in the actual proceeding in actual telescopes, Ao found a way to covertly accompany her darling to the event. Both girls get to experiment how the technical aspects on how to watch asteroids, which they knew a couple of, are the key to fulfill their dream, and while not getting to the promised land at the end, Ao and Mira get even more determined to discover a new asteroid.<br />
<br />
Art (10/10):<br />
Doga Kobo&#039;s sweet and very colourful art is always a pleasure to the eyes, the girls are extremely cute and adorable, and especially the design of Monroe-senpai is the finest out there. No weird animations were showed, there&#039;s a lot of fluid animation on the movements.<br />
<br />
The backgrounds and especially the ones with starry skies are a luxury to watch, since I don&#039;t know much more about astronomy nor the astronomical sky, I&#039;ll say that most of the better known northern sky constellations are spot on (I can just watch the Cruz del Sur rather than the Ursa Major), also the strata of the core samplings and the rocks were very well drawn and actually made me smile because of the correct details.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10):<br />
The &quot;least&quot; noticeable aspect that goes hiding is the sound; as in many Doga Kobo animes, relatively new seiyuus get the main characters, with Megumi Yamaguchi (Hifumi Takimoto in New Game!) doing Ao, and Tomoyo Takayanagi (Hana Shirosaki in Wataten) as Mira. The more established Nao Touyama (Karen Kujou in Kiniro Mosaic) and Sumire Uesaka (Sanae Dekomori in Chuunibyou) get to voice Sakura-senpai and Monroe-senpai, respectively.<br />
<br />
The opening is pretty average for someone of the stature of Touyama, and the ending is also very average, but both can be very serviceable due to the extremely mild ambiance of Asteroid. The background sounds give small touches to the relaxing nature of the anime, nothing too loud or too opaque, just there to support the show.<br />
<br />
Characters (9/10):<br />
In Doga Kobo animes, the characters are the stars that shine the most. Each one of the girls has a defined personality and never gets overly aggressive or raunchy, which gives a sweeter calm for the viewer, their relationships are pure and cute, sometimes yuri-esque. I’ll only talk about the Earth Science Club members.<br />
<br />
Mira Konohata is an energetic girl who has a fascination on astronomy, principally in asteroids, she’ll do anything to help her friends, be it in the astronomy section or not. Her close relationship with Ao is the driving force of the plot.<br />
<br />
Ao Manaka is a very serious girl, who rarely expresses emotion, acting rationally while investigating the intricate details of the universe, but hides her deep crush on Mira that it wasn’t born the day they reencountered, rather from the very first time they meet. However, in contrast to the more hostile silent girls of other anime, Ao is very friendly with her colleagues.<br />
<br />
Mai Inose is the least visible girl out there, but her presence is fundamental to maintain the order of the things in the Earth Science Club after the graduation of Monroe and Sakura. Geology and cartography are her specialties, which makes her a little distant toward Ao and Mira.<br />
<br />
President Mari Morino is elegant and graceful, but has a very playful side that appears in the most critical situations; Monroe-senpai is well versed on astronomy and wants to be an astronaut. Vice-president Mikage Sakurai is rough, but never violent, rather playful, always willing to explore the wonders of the lithosphere; Sakura-senpai is always available to help the club.<br />
<br />
Chikage Sakurai, like her sister, is literate on geology, but also on geomancy, only differing with Mikage in being energetic. Yuu Nanami is a sullen short haired girl which has a somber past due to natural disasters, so she now studies meteorology to help people take correct decisions concerning weather catastrophes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
When I was a student quite a few years ago, learning about the outer space, the stars and the celestial bodies bored me to death, ironically, Asteroid in Love made me feel some love for the universe that is mostly based on the surgical combination of something more close to my major, which is geology. The girls and the very digestible theoretical explanations of the secrets of the asteroids and the lithosphere gave me a weekly dose of educational science cuteness.<br />
<br />
In the common denominator of modern cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime, the yuri subtext has become a staple in the plot, which in many cases, had become the central aspect of many recent shows, Koisuru Asteroid is not the exception. Stories about finding love when sharing a common hobby have existed since the beginning of history (or possibly prehistory), Ao’s repressed feelings for Mina because they want to discover an asteroid together forced the former to live with the latter, and that’s the absolute demonstration of passionate love.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the outer space subjects the lithosphere and the atmosphere to being second fiddle in size and importance, and despite the sometimes unreachable universe to the human technological progress, Asteroid in Love bridges the gap between the hard theory and the average mind of an anime fan, between the coldness of the space vacuum and the warmth of the cute girls, and between the distance of asteroids and the sweet girls enjoying their school life studying them.<br />
<br />
Final score: 9/10.

    Asteroid in Love is a Japanese manga series by Quro (which is their only anime and manga). An anime television series adaptation by Doga Kobo(Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Plastic Memories, Himouto! Umaru-chan) premiered on January 3, 2020.<br />
<br />
Asteroid in Love centers on Mira Kinohata, who is dreaming of joining the astronomy club, when she enters high school. Her hobby was born because of a man, whom she had promised to discover new asteroids when she was younger. However, when Mira&#039;s high school life starts, she finds out that her school only has the earth sciences club, a club that consists of the astronomy and geology clubs. What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333056">
        is more, Mira finds out that a man that she wanted to see again so much is actually a girl. Alongside their fellow club members, Mira and her old friend Manaka Ao take part in various astronomical activities, hoping to one day discover an asteroid.<br />
<br />
Asteroid in Love is bright and colorful. While all characters do look somewhat average and nothing special, they are also charmingly cute at the same time. Not only do all the characters look cute and even unique, the backgrounds are quite beautiful. As a result, this is a very appealing-looking series, with no fan service, which is just pleasant to watch.<br />
<br />
Character wise, the show is fine. All characters have different personalities and receive enough development as well as the screen time, which makes watching the series interesting. It is not just any slice of life, Koisuru Asteroid has a story to tell and it makes it somewhat unique.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment wise, the show is quite enjoyable, but I am slightly disappointed, too. I am very grateful to the creator for the fact that that show had no yuri and no fan service. Disappointment wise, I would love to see more focus on club activities, to tell the truth, astronomy is limitless and there are so many charming and interesting things about it, but that not much of a problem that the series focuses more on character interactions than on club activities.<br />
<br />
All in all, I am surprised, to tell the truth. While it might be somewhat difficult, or even unreal for some to marathon the whole series in one day, which you should not do, unless you are a hardcore slice of life fan, watching this show little by little works wonders and quite enjoyable, I must say. A must watch for hardcore slice of life fans.

    It’s always a bonus when an anime resonates with things you’re genuinely passionate about. <br />
<br />
Koisuru is the first anime I’ve ever seen to deal with my first love of astronomy and by all accounts, it did a damn good job. When it comes to Doga Kobo shows we know what we’ll get. Cute girls doing cute things, occasional yuri ships and wholesome content that makes you want to go out and find your own niche group of friends. Koisuru delivered on those expectations and more. <br />
<br />
Not only were we treated to wholesome interactions between the cast on their adventures to discover and name an asteroid,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333072">
        but we actually were treated to extremely accurate information regarding astronomy. Entire segments of episodes are seemingly love letters to the field, including useful tutorials and other tidbits for amateurs wishing to gaze upon the cosmos. <br />
<br />
In usual Doga Kobo form, we get gorgeous bright colour palettes throughout the series with consistent character models and quality animation. There’s not much to speak of from a technical perspective with these types of shows as they mainly revolve around character interactions and dialogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
The blend of the usual cute girls doing cute things with the educational aspect really made Koisuru standout and resonate with me. I believe that if you have any interest at all in learning about space, astronomy or science in general, this is a great show for you. It’s a really fun, wholesome and educational journey of friendship and discovery. It’s nothing revolutionary or mind-blowing, but it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and the story it tells is a fun one.<br />
<br />
Koisuru gets 9 asteroids out of 10 from me.

    Life sucks, so let’s just allow ourselves to sink into the soft pillowy embrace of alcoho-er...I mean...cute girl anime. <br />
<br />
If its core fanbase wasn’t evidence enough, it’s hard to fuck up a cute girl anime. In the past, I’ve gone on record being fairly lenient towards most low-effort moe anime. With “Koisuru Asteroid”, most of my convictions about cute girl anime have been gravely perturbed. <br />
<br />
The term “CGDCT” or “Cute girls doing cute things” is one I’ve never been a fan of, if not for the sole reason that I grew up in the era that encapsulated its inception and persistence. I get the appeal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333076">
        because I lived through the majority of this genre’s golden age. I understand why certain fans will come to the defense of even the most niche entries in this genre.<br />
<br />
There’s a reason why the term “CGDCT” is used as a pejorative, and that’s because shows like this will rise to the surface every once in a while. Let’s cut to the chase, this show is mind-numbingly boring. Let’s stop kidding ourselves with this shit. Is this show REALLY worth defending? The core audience for this show is insomniacs, frankly, that’s the only type of person I’d ever recommend this show to. Someone so out of sync with their body-clock that conventional methods of conking out just don’t do it anymore. <br />
<br />
I’ve been seeing this show unfairly defended as an “iyashikei” anime, but the whole point of iyashikei anime is to heal you, not put you to sleep by the time the opening theme is finished. To me, this show has carved the path towards an entirely new genre of anime, anime so boring and full of grey-matter that it melts your consciousness into a sleep-inducing lull. <br />
<br />
What can I say about Koisuru besides the fact that watching it was a blur? None of the characters track. Not a single one of them had new or interesting traits we haven’t seen recycled dozens of times already. The protagonist is your typical bubbly energetic moe-blob joined at the hip with her reserved best-friend, what a genius contrast, you couldn’t make this shit up. There wasn’t a single believable or compelling storyline and most of the side-characters were just there to pad the runtime. The character designs are plain/simple which is an honest rarity for Doga Kobo. <br />
<br />
Unless you’ve already cultivated an active interest in the topic at hand (not that it can&#039;t be framed in an interesting way) you’d need the goddamn Ludovico Technique to stay awake watching this show. It is utterly bereft of anything worthwhile in a half-decent cute girl anime.<br />
<br />
Let’s just end it here, because at the very least I can credit this show with fixing my sleep schedule, thank fuck. Goodnight folks. <br />
<br />

    This is honestly really nice. It&#039;s one of those all girl cast animes, filled with such cute moments, but also following a clear and interesting story with it&#039;s theme being based around space, rocks, maps and all sorts of things related to those. I dunno about you, but rocks and space just really interest me lol. I&#039;d collect them myself, but you&#039;re here for the review.<br />
<br />
What helps the anime is it&#039;s story of childhood friends, reuniting years later, and really becoming best friends. Along with the relationships with the other club members, and that they have with each other. It&#039;s cute, and it&#039;s honestly relaxing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327351">
        too. Sometimes a peaceful and calm anime like this is just what you need.<br />
<br />
The art style I adore too. It&#039;s really colourful, and that is what makes it beautiful in my eyes. Really well done. No matter it be the characters themselves, or colours of the sky, or scenery. It&#039;s well done all round. <br />
<br />
The music and sounds in general is also fitting for purpose, and really good. <br />
<br />
Honestly a fine anime for this season, you should check it out while it&#039;s still going!

    Koisuru Asteroid is a fairly by-the-numbers entry to the &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; genre. This time it&#039;s centered around a schools natural science club, and follows a group of friends - including two girls that have reconnected years later, after a chance meeting where they have made a promise to discover and name an asteroid together.<br />
<br />
The art style is nice, the characters are cute and the episodes are pretty chill, as is par for the course for this type of anime.<br />
<br />
What else is there to say though... Well, for people who enjoy this kind of anime it&#039;s serviceable enough and fans of K-On! or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333112">
        Non Non Biyori for example, might find more enjoyment here than I did. In my own experience though I found it lacking. It covers a lot of the same ground that shows like those did, but lacks the dry humor of Non Non Biyori, or the character depth and musical hook of K-On to keep me interested. It&#039;s talked about, but there&#039;s not a lot of emphasis on exploring the science side of things, nor the romantic undertones that are hinted at early on. <br />
<br />
The show is just kind of...forgettable. And even now I&#039;m finding it hard to remember any of the character names or anything that happened in the episodes. Not the worst thing I&#039;ve ever watched, but could have used an injection of comedy, romance or more in-depth use of the natural science plot to make it stand out a little more.

    This is a review of the anime and manga series, Koisuru Asteroid (KoiAsu). I will principally focus on the anime, and do note that there will be spoilers for this series.<br />
<br />
Now what is KoiAsu about? To put it simply, it covers the Earth Sciences club, and the members as they carry out activities about geology and astronomy. We have Morino (Monroe-senpai), Mira, and Ao on the astronomy team, and Inose and Sakura on the geology team, with Chikage and Nanami (interested in meteorology) joining the team later on in the anime. For both Mira and Ao, they have a common purpose for joining this club:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406147">
        Years ago, when both were young, they had made a promise to each other to find an asteroid and name it Ao, as a result of Mira sharing a name with the variable star Mira (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira), but Ao not sharing a name with anything. <br />
<br />
Story: Now KoiAsu the manga is a 4-koma, and as such, the anime has a lot of original stuff not seen in the manga.  The anime does this very well, with the general plotlines of the story and characters generally remaining the same, but however there are a lot of mini details added to it that really make the series pop, like for example Inose’s rather slow sidestepping or after Inose’s first event as club president, showing how Inose’s blur photos were due to her nervousness. Now, the studio for this anime is Doga Kobo. Doga Kobo is known for adding a bit of yuri to the CGDCT animes they watch (but obviously not converting it into a yuri anime). Suzuya is the main driver of the yuri in the anime, with a lot of implied yuri scenes being instigated by her, like ”confessing her feelings” to Misa, or getting Mira to tell Ao a pickup line when they visit her because she’s sick, on top of the fact that Mira mistook Ao for a boy when they were younger, which was already in the manga. The manga name might be “Koisuru Asteroid”, but the characters go beyond just sticking to their own respective fields, with the geology team learning more about asteroids, and vice versa. This shows when Inose, during the Earth Science Olympiad, is able to answer the astronomy questions easily. On top of just the club itself, the anime also shows ||Inose’s interest in geology, and Suzuya working at the bakery, and how she is inspired by those in the Earth Sciences club, helping them during the cultural festival.<br />
The manga also expands on the anime. The anime contains and usually focuses on directing the story in a way that made you feel emotional. There were many moments where things got more interesting, such as Ao&#039;s moving away, or before that, we have the end of the cultural festival where Ino got promoted to club president, and the anime attempted to cut out a few jokes just to make these moments at the end feel genuine, and worth watching. Unlike many other CGDCTs where many girls felt slightly shocked and surprised, and at the same time they were like &#039;yeah it&#039;s just a joke and the end and we&#039;re not serious about any of these after all&#039;, the method of flowing a story&#039;s tension and the like in KoiAsu anime overall left a lasting impression on me. The manga is where more jokes (especially ones that are omitted from the anime) work better - it&#039;s a normal 4-koma read after all, and also the place for latest update of most of the parts getting adapted and animated.<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters undergo good character development throughout the anime itself. For example, Ao goes from being a nervous person when speaking due to a past mistake, to someone who has the courage to attempt to join the Shining Star challenge despite not meeting the requirements and asking her parents to let her stay with Mira so they can continue to find an asteroid together. Inose gradually becomes more confident after being made club president, from someone who was unconfident about taking the role, to being able to take on the Earth Science Olympiad.<br />
<br />
Art: Now, I’m not a great judge of art. However, 2 scenes stand out in my mind: The ED, which shows the different characters at home, then young Ao and Mira together, then the characters observing the night sky. Fun fact: The storyboard for the animation in the ED was created by the same storyboard artist who worked the Chika dance in Kaguya-sama, Naoya Nakayama.<br />
<br />
Another scene which stands out for me is where after Inose finds out why she took bad pictures, she gradually turns and puts her head on the table.<br />
<br />
Sound: Again, I’m not the greatest judge of VAs, but I can tell you that the ED (Yozora) is an absolute masterpiece and one of my favourite anime EDs, especially when paired with the outro mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Overall, I really loved the anime, it really makes topics like astronomy and geology (which can be highly technical) enjoyable to the average watcher. The anime is one of the 3 animes (the other being K-On and Takagi) to make me feel sad at its ending, and that’s one of the reasons I love it.<br />

    A review of Koisuru Asteroid from an aspiring earth scientist&#039;s point of view.<br />
<br />
WARNING: Can be VERY LONG and have minor spoilers. May gush on about some things as well. The review really only starts in the 3rd paragraph.<br />
<br />
Koisuru Asteroid is a fairly typical CGDCT anime. But it is a typical CGDCT anime that dreams. It dreams to help others discover, wonder, and pursue. Whether it be knowledge, human connections, introspectiveness - this anime was made with a clear goal of allowing its audience to appreciate these aspects while providing an extremely relaxing, heartwarming, and endearing little tale about people who have aspirations in their lives.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333130">
        <br />
<br />
I love this anime. I went into it only because it had a slight whiff of geology involved (which is the field I am studying and is a subject hardly seen in anime outside of disaster anime which in itself is rare) as well as being a CGDCT anime - a genre I believe is probably one of the safest choices and has a wide variety of stuff to offer. I had the expectations that it would only have the earth sciences club as a contrived gimmick to get them together that would be shoved to the back room and only be used as a setting for wacky high-school girl shenanigans that you see so often in anime. Colour me surprised when they not only didn&#039;t drop their gimmick - but they made it the focal point with the sciences becoming the major theme of this show. In addition they also cut down on the wackiness that is prevalent in most anime of its ilk. I feel like this anime was honestly made just for me. I haven&#039;t felt this connected to an anime since Yuru Camp almost 2 years ago. <br />
<br />
Getting my personal adoration for this anime out of the way, lets start with the actual review. Ao and Mira are the main characters of this show. Having previously met when they were younger - making a promise to each other to find a new asteroid in a flash of impetus - they reunite in highschool in the Earth Sciences Club - still holding on to their promises made years before. The Earth Sciences Club was formed from a merging of the old Astronomy and Geology Clubs thus delineating the main fields of natural science that will be explored throughout the show. The story itself is quite normal for a character-driven CGDCT show as well. Most of the episodes have the Earth Sciences club members do fairly typical slice-of-life stuff like a club barbecue, a beach episode, a school-festival episode etc. but with an added mix of science-related activities in line with their club. From here on the anime gets pretty schizophrenic with its pacing. The pacing never settles down on one thing and sometimes there are up to six different things happening each episode. This was adapted from a 4-koma manga so its not particularly surprising but this anime seriously never knows when to stop throwing us around the different stuff the various characters do - either together or as individuals. As much as I like each individual story, it just isn&#039;t very well put-together.<br />
<br />
The problems from this become apparent as the story feels extremely broken up with some character development as well as some sub-plots (yes there are those) being lost in the mess and never really gets expanded upon. Suzu and Misa as well as the relationship they had (as well as the one we yuri-baiters wished they have) were pretty hard casualties of the horrible jumping-around. Most of the other characters get away with it due to the sheer screentime they occupy but I really would have liked the anime to have more structure and actually remember to resolve and look into some of its plot-threads. This is the primary gripe I have with this show and one which would definitely turn off people from watching it because, through the wacky pacing, it never looks like anything is getting done by the characters. <br />
<br />
The characters are, however, the aspect of this show that carries it far and beyond what I expect from a CGDCT show. They&#039;re all your fairly typical CGDCT character tropes and you really shouldn&#039;t expect this anime to be breaking any new ground in characterisation but I&#039;ll do my best to describe them. This anime gives them something special though- introspective thought. Because they have the ability to reflect on themselves they become vessel that carries the central themes of the show. They become far more human than almost every other CGDCT cast of characters. It turns the anime from a quick-paced, rapid-fire comedy with plenty of gags into a grounded, down to earth (hehe see what I did there?) slice-of-life that cares about how it handles its characters. How this impacts the anime is subtle but it is noticed in the plethora of emotional build-ups and the actions the characters do after making a profound discovery. They create new goals for themselves, they become curious about others as well as open up to others about themselves in a very natural way.<br />
<br />
This anime perfectly illustrates each character&#039;s own unique personality, motivations, and trials they have to overcome. Each one of them (well, Ao and Mira make a pair but whatever) have their own field of science they want to get into. The anime not only shows why they want to do so but also how it affects their daily lives in that they can apply what they learned to create their own allegories and lessons. Even through the anime&#039;s blinding pacing, it gives us great little stories and encounters of each character and what lessons they take away from it. For the sake of structure on this already-long review I&#039;ll split the individual analysis of characters into Geology Side and Astronomy Side<br />
<br />
GEOLOGY <br />
<br />
Sakurai Mikage and Inose Mai are on the geology side of the club. Obviously my favourite 2 characters because of geology. This anime perfectly demonstrates how their interest are weaved into their lives. If you watched the anime thinking they were caricaturing geologist with their weird actions, you&#039;re wrong. Of course Mikage has an extensive rock collection because I and many of my classmates have. Of course they would observe the smooth rock while they&#039;re relaxing in the hot-springs because I would do that to to any rock on the side of the road that interest me. The generally stoic and careful Mikage has always viewed geology as a hobby but never had any clear goals in life. Her tsundere tendencies are very typical of her character type but she makes it hers alone due to having a well-applied personality. Throughout the show we see her interest in geology evolve by seeing the passion of the other club members. Having never seen her geology knowledge applied outside of her own closed world view, she begins to appreciate what her ability to conduct research can do. In episode 5, with Mira as the impetus, she slowly breaks out of her initially-closed-off self and starts to appreciate what she does for others as well as what others did for her. Its a slow but significant piece of development for her as she also starts consciously guiding others both as a normal highschool girl and as someone dabbling with the earth sciences. She&#039;s a great baseline for the anime of being a normal person who wants to be a scientist. Always being careful - she is initially scared to expose her hobby to others - always thinking it &quot;isn&#039;t good enough&quot;. This is a feeling that doesn&#039;t just apply to sciences but to anything you can think of. It makes her relatable.<br />
<br />
For Inose, science was a way for her to discover her confidence. She grabs a good amount of time in early eps and almost the entirety of episode 8. She is easily one of the most endearing characters because of her design and quiet, worry-wart disposition. She also can&#039;t handle a camera well which is very cute. Her interest comes from geological mapping and she uses science as a way to improve herself by gaining confidence. The anime perfectly shows how she grows from her experience. The quote &quot;Sometimes it&#039;s better to do something familiar than to force yourself to try something new&quot; that stuck with her was something I genuinely appreciated. Too many stories tell us that its not good to stick to something and that it&#039;s good to go out to get new experiences. Whilst this is sound advice this isn&#039;t the reality for most people. For some situations you find yourself in its safe to stick to what you know. Not only was it shown in an offhand manner in that she can&#039;t take good photographs no matter how hard she tries, but she strives to use her earth sciences knowledge she gathered from being with the club to improve herself as a new club president and as a person. It&#039;s a wonderful development from what she also essentially viewed as a hobby. <br />
<br />
ASTRONOMY<br />
<br />
Morino Mari is the basic club-president trope you can see in many other shows with clubs. She aspires to be an astronaut which is an incredibly tough job to become and the anime shows her diligence well. Initially she was fairly emotionally-detached from the club only seeing it as a stepping stone to her future. However, her interactions in the club and meeting new people as well as learning their motivations allows her to open up and relax more. Her character shows how knowledge doesn&#039;t have to be sterile and single-minded. Her story shows the human side of science in that it is, not just possible, but necessary to make connections with others. Its a shame she isn&#039;t given much screentime since she has to lend it to the main characters but her development never felt incomplete. <br />
<br />
Mira and Ao are basically a red-oni, blue-oni pair. They seek to discover a new asteroid and it is this passion that drives much of the series. Plenty of the other characters come to their own realizations because of the dynamic the duo put up. Individually, they both make pretty great characters as well. Mira is the typical genki girl whose genki-ness fires up the club members and becomes the heart of the club. The anime, however, provides her with a lot of subtle characterisation that prevents her being an out-and-out trope. She has situational awareness unlike most other characters of her type (looking at Yui as much as I like K-On!) which allows her to take control of the flow of any situation. She has a keen learning mind which allows her to also appreciate learning things outside her (extremely passionate) field of science unlike many other single-minded tropes. Ao is much more calm and is driven by Mira&#039;s passion. Without Mira you get the feeling she would probably end up like how Morino was before the club was formed - only seeing things as a means to an end. She becomes much more impulsive thanks to Mira which almost gets her into trouble near the end. It&#039;s great seeing the 2 really want to learn knew things and somewhat makes me reminisce on how I was in highschool - which is probably the point of this show. I would have liked to see more of them. The anime somehow doesn&#039;t give them much time to do new things so the rest of the club members somehow get more impactful development than them. The final few episodes focus almost exclusively on Mira and Ao but it would have been nice to spread it out a bit. Still, they&#039;re great characters that provide a good baseline for the others.<br />
<br />
Suzu is the best supporting character just because of: &quot;That&#039;s because she&#039;s a girl and she&#039;s cute. It it&#039;s a girl, I&#039;m A-OK!&quot; - Suzuya Moe, 2020<br />
But seriously she has so much personality that I&#039;m really sad she doesn&#039;t get more scenes nor a resolution except for a &quot;rejection haircut&quot; T__T We need more of her.<br />
 <br />
2 other characters are introduced very late into the show and I can&#039;t really talk much about them. They&#039;re not bad characters just more victims of the shot pacing. I would love to see them in a second season but Doga Kobo is never gonna do that because if we can&#039;t get a season 2 of Gekkan Shoujo but we do for Umaru it just meas we&#039;re living in the darkest timeline. <br />
 <br />
The anime&#039;s knack for science was perfectly weaved into their lives. There&#039;s plenty of scientific explanations that actually go into a fair bit of detail. It probably would put some people off but it&#039;s just interesting stuff and puts into context the way science has shaped our characters. It adds to the curiosity factor the anime brings out in people. This anime also has comedy that has so many layers and Venn diagrams to understand. Was I the only person who laughed at episode 4&#039;s joke of Mira stacking cakes while making a &quot;columnar jointing&quot; joke? (Columnar jointing is when basalt lava cools quickly and contracts forming hexagonal-shaped cracks when it solidifies with the most famous example being the Giant&#039;s Causeway in Northern Ireland). This is actually realistic. I know people who make lame science jokes like this. It just makes the anime feel so much more human because you know the creator payed attention to these sort of things. <br />
<br />
The animation was pretty consistent as expected from Doga Kobo. There are a few scenes of off-model though especially in long shots. They used a very simple art style and colour palate similar to the manga and other DOga Kobo shows which isn&#039;t bad or anything but I would really like to see them put in more detail like in their previous works like Wataten (how does that have the most detailed backgrounds in all DOga Kobo anime?). The character designs are simple and cute and its easy to know exactly what personality each character has. Character animation is pretty top notch too but there unfortunately isn&#039;t too much of it since the directing was quite safe. Music was great though. The OP and especially ED are sublime to listen to with the great visuals. That ED perfectly encapsulates the grounded feel of the anime and isn&#039;t a showy, energetic track like plenty of other shows. The BGM tracks are nice to listen to and fit each scene well though it could do with more variety with different moods. Overall its a pretty solid production that I could expect from a production which people liked to work on.<br />
<br />
I hold this anime dear to me because it shows that science isn&#039;t just a bunch of sterile, emotionless white coats. Science is pursued by people who have dreams, who have a goal they strive to achieve. They all have different motivations. Some pursue knowledge to know everything there is to know, some want to expand on the field they love, some want to know more about themselves, and some want to help others with the knowledge they gain. There&#039;s plenty of emotions in science and its all because people are passionate about it. This anime is about discovering that passion and applying it to connect with others and becoming a more rounded person. <br />
<br />
Koisuru Asteroid was a surprise for me for various reasons. It has great characters and an endearing tale of discovery. I hate how people skipped over this just because they thought it was another shallow CGDCT show. I may be biased towards this anime as a researcher (wannabe) but there&#039;s plenty to take away from this anime if you look in the right places. If you look closer at the characters and their motivations and actions, you might find something relatable. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!<br />

    I am literally in love with this anime. Everything blends right together. The music, animation, and voice acting are all incredible. The music matches the mood of the moment and amplifies it. I have cried many times during this anime, mostly because of the music and story line occurring. The animation is incredibly well done with beautiful scenery and character designs. The voice acting is emotional and pushes the narrative forwards incredibly well. Overall, this is an absolute masterpiece by a studio that has had some hits and misses.

             A story that, in beginning, is very relaxing and, in the same time, mild dramatic content. It&#039;s my first impression that I have about Koisuru Asteroid. Storys that talk about characters united by same thing like a hobbie of a familiar event, likes as Kimi No Na Wa, always attract me, and was that happen with this anime. The art color are, impressionaly, vivid and bright and are extremaçy rare on anime series art tecnics, because this type of art is more used in anime movies. If you watch Koisuru Asteroid in a dark room, you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329266">
        can have headache due of bright and vivid colores.<br />
	We know the work is about two childrens in a camp that do a promisses of &quot;found his own star&quot; and after found each other on college. Therefore, exist a manner in artistic production to reproduce fells like nostalgia, tranquily and chilbourhood when it mix the vivid colores of animation with the light and childlike traits of the characters. In other words, they try to pass the anime mensage in animation. The characters are adolescents but they are similiar to childrens due draws style that, in mangá, is used to make kids, like short stature and small breasts (in girls). Koisuru Asteroid doesn&#039;t show adolescence like studyin, fun, sex or other themes that are showed with stereotype in ocidental culture industry (mainly in romantic comedies of Hollywood), but like as a continuation of chilhood dreams and ambitions.<br />
	However, in same time the anime art surprised me, the story and the pessoal and intelectual development of characters was very bad. The geoscience club is a group of stereotypes of anime characters (the protagonist so cheerful and positive that it sounds something unnatural and irritating like mira is impossible to found her on real life, or, if she can be founded, she will be very irritant). However, the worst thing about Koisuru Asteroid is the way that the story is happened: In some episodes, the characters prefer only talk about astronomy or geology than participate in the screenplay). Koisuru Asteroid is similiar to an scientific educative cartoons for children. I was very unhappy because of an anime that have a nice art but with a bad story.

    Koisuru Asteroid Is a great show and if you like slice of life, it would be a good fit. It’s one the of the shows that you don’t need to be interested in the subject but you can still enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Story10/10<br />
The story was what made me watch it in the first place,It was pretty interesting.<br />
It’s about a girl who once meets a boy while out camping and the boy talks about asteroid and found out her name is a asteroids name but there was no asteroid with the boys name so she decided to find a new asteroid and name it after him then a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342584">
        few years later they meet again and she found out that boy was a girl and stilled continued to find a new asteroid.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
The art was good. How they draw the characters and settings and they especially did a great job on drawing the stars in the sky and it was a really colorful and nice art style.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
The sound was good as well and the voice actors did a good job and the OP and ED songs weren’t that bad as well.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
The characters I pretty much liked all of them. You got the heroine a cheerful character and then another main a quiet and shy but knows a lot and a senpai that is kind and another senpai who is kind of a tsundere.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
It was a really enjoyable show for me and if it sound interesting to you, you should probably try it out <br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
It’s just high school girls trying to complete their dreams even if tough and that’s pretty normal about anime’s but it’s pretty different depending on what and I have not really seen a show about asteroids before so I guess you can also learn a bit.<br />

    This anime had me sceptical at fist it had a low rating but the animation style looked really good and the comedy right up my ally. <br />
<br />
This anime had a very good start having an interesting twist instantly hooking me. After that, I can agree that the pacing is a little over the place much different to a lot of other &quot;slice of life&quot; anime not giving a proper &quot;A day in a life&quot; sections (&quot;a day in a life&quot; referring to a section that is the main character average day.), as well as the sense of time, is a bit off. Other than that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354429">
        the whole anime is amazing the art is beautiful, the information on astronomy and archology is very interesting, the characters are all cute and cool and play normal anime tropes well, the comedy is really funny (At lest for me.) and the over arching story is a roller-coaster of emotions.<br />
<br />
All in all Koisuru Asteroid is the best documentary I have ever watched its made with  25% funny jokes 15% information on astronomy and archology 40% A cool relatable slice of life 30% roller-coaster of tanagers finding themselves and 100% cute anime girls!<br />

    I did watch the first episode of Asteroid in Love back when it first premiered, but back then, I was in a foul mood, so I wasn&#039;t able to appreciate. Now, I went back to this anime with more nuanced eyes and decided to give it a second try. So, was Asteroid in Love any good? Well, let&#039;s hop on and find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
Warning! Spoiler alert!<br />
<br />
Story<br />
At first glance, Asteroid in Love might seem like one of those TV shows you wouldn&#039;t be able to enjoy if you weren&#039;t into the subject matter, in this case, astronomy. Luckily, if you give it a chance and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396476">
        stay beyond the first episode, you&#039;ll be in for a pleasant surprise. Yes, astronomoy and other sciences do play an important part in the story, but the show&#039;s main element is the bonds of friendship between the characters. It&#039;s the characters&#039; interest in different sciences, rather than the sciences themselves, what push the show forward. True, you might yourself unable to understand some of the scientific themes, but then again, this show isn&#039;t mean to be a documentary, but rather a story about how the girls appreciate these themes and how they use those lessons to improve themselves as human beings. (7/10)<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
I&#039;ve always believed that characters are the lifeblood of the story and Asteroid in Love follows this principle very closely. Like I said before, the characters move the story forward, not the sciences.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just gonna put this out there: every character is a shining paragon of goodness. No, seriously, every character in this show is friendly, gentle and unfailingly polite with one another. Whenever the characters have a misunderstanding or a conflict, it&#039;s resolved almost immediately and, in the end, there aren&#039;t any characters that can be considered anatagonists. That&#039;s perfectly fine, though. If there were any antagonists, Asteroid in Love would have a been a completely different story.<br />
<br />
Anyway, most of the important characters are girls that aren&#039;t afraid to show affection to one another and it would have been easy for the show to immediately label them as lesbians. Fortunately, the show takes the road less travelled and merely keeps the focus on the show&#039;s bonds of friendship rather than any romantic love.<br />
<br />
If I had to pick a favorite character, I&#039;d choose Mikage. Don&#039;t get me wrong, protagonist Mira&#039;s bonds with other characters (especially Ao) make her a compelling character, it&#039;s just that I found it easier to relate to Mikage&#039;s struggle to find a dream and desire to keep the Earth Sciences Club active. She wants to protect something that gives her joy and validation and that&#039;s something that many people, myself included, can understand.<br />
<br />
All in all, the character writing is the show&#039;s strongest aspect. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Everything about this show is just so bright and sparkly, and I&#039;m not talking just about the stars and the stones. Everything, from the characters&#039; eyes to the waters, looks pleasantly bright and sparkly and you could hours upon hours watching the show&#039;s beautiful lighting. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Sounds<br />
Asteroid in Love boasts a soothing and heartwarming soundtrack, especially for the character moments and the stargazing. The opening song by Nao Touyama (who voices Mikage in the Japanese version) is suitably beautiful and relaxing for an appropriately positive show.<br />
<br />
That said, I did watch the English version and I was impressed by the vocal performances of Lindsay Seidel (Mira), Terri Doty (Mikage) and Apphia Yu (Chikage). I hope they get more work because of this show. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
While the lessons in astronomy, geology and meteorology are enjoyable in their own right, what truly makes Asteroid in Love is the character writing. Asteroid in Love is heartwarming and life-affirming experience that celebrates friendship and dream-chasing and I highly recommend it. (8/10)

    I think I definitely came into this show with a bad impression. I used to be neutral with astronomy. That is, before I took college level courses on it. I know MUCH more than this anime had ever touched upon, (I really wish I hadn&#039;t, honestly). Like, the fact that I crammed hours learning about Cepheid variable stars, parallax technique, fundamental theorem of the universe, dark matter/energy, etc etc and having to take a final on it definitely made me absolutely hate astronomy. The fact that the introductory episode opens up with Mira being a popular variable star made me cringe.<br />
<br />
I learned absolutely nothing new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335466">
        in the few episodes I watched, and I really doubt it goes very in depth into astronomy (I mean, it&#039;s an anime, come on now). I am absolutely no expert on astronomy, but I know how most things work, so the &quot;learning&quot; aspect of this show was a disaster. <br />
<br />
<br />
But enough of the negative/extremely biased views. What makes this show terrible, barring my complaints and venomous hate towards astronomy? As for actual characters go, it&#039;s your very orthodox CGDCT show. I thought it was going to have some comedy, but no, it&#039;s just slice of life CGDCT. Not that this slice of life was terrible or anything, but it certainly isn&#039;t worth watching. At all. It&#039;s not animated beautifully, the dialogue isn&#039;t quite meaningful, the character&#039;s are pretty typical, and the story is just what you&#039;d expect from an anime about a school club: club activities and the festival, and some summer camp adventures.<br />
<br />
All in all, look somewhere else<br />

    The show telling me how cute girls doing their cute thing. Its funny, how two different club become one. Like sky and the earth? A big challenge there, but they manage to put all the problem together so fast. How cute with what they are doing, i can&#039;t stop smiling, i can&#039;t stop tearing my eyes. Maybe i dont have any interest about the concept to the astronomical thing, or even the geology one. However, with just looking to their activity, i just feel refreshed, a nostalgic memories to bring back by this show. I had the same feeling to Suzu-chan at some scene though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333758">
        their activity together. Yet, repetitive moment got blown up sometimes, another cute character show on to fill the blank. A bit sad with Mira and Ao can not find their dreams. But no problem girls, just enjoy your time at your big family, and be fun with your life. Then, your dream abour asteroid can coming as a bonus. Yes, had a fun, like Sensei there.<br />
<br />
Dang, a bit rushed, but i can&#039;t do anything to change the duration of the episode. And i can&#039;t really ask about the other season, i will be realistic about the trafic watch through this show. Some souls may judge this whole series as a boredom. And some devils shall call this as a cringy thingy. I can&#039;t help, but wish other anime should follow these concept, i like this. I like how cute girls doing cute things. Lol<br />
<br />
I may add some critics about some points. First, their repetitive and cliche way through their club activities. Second, their end not much ended as my standard too. Its somehow feel blank in to my heart. I can called it as an open ending one, thats not good to stop the show in that way. I know the studio might planning to get other season, or make this anime into a cliche cliffhanger show. But, i dont feel thats the strength point over these, and can not make any improvement toward the whole series. Its good to show how two senpai get their graduate, its my strongest plot in this show, some melodrama dont be too hard to put, right? So, maybe the end can put it too, even get the ssteroid one as an ending. I know, thats shall be impossible. But, its a fun, why not bring more fun to end this series?<br />
<br />
Okay, enough, thats my thought. Gladly i found this before move on to other season. This show prove me to never judge the book by its cover. Well done, you get my 9. With that, i may put up other section as an average 8 point, because i can&#039;t take any other words. Yes, 8 as an Overall, plus one point for my respect to make such a lovely series. <br />
<br />
Well, its time for me to move on.

    I&#039;m in love with astronomy, so I searched for an anime that will focus on something like that and I found out about this anime. To begin with, I cannot say I didn&#039;t enjoy the anime but there&#039;s a lot of things lacking. As astronomy lover, I expected a lot of nice landscapes and space scenes, something like Kimi no Na wa, but that was not the case with this anime. <br />
<br />
The plot is interesting, but the story development is obviously not that good.  I would say that sound was okay, whereas I was not in love with the art style. I don&#039;t know,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380500">
        but the art style was very strange to me, they had dark purple strokes and some colors were uncommon(I believe I am not used to different stroke colors because black ones are mostly used). <br />
<br />
In conclusion, I would recommend this anime, especially to Astronomy lovers! Even though I didn&#039;t enjoy the anime at all, it doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t. This is my first review of an anime, so please have a bit of mercy. :)

    Not bad. It&#039;s shoujo ai slice of life with high school girls. It has a twist in that all the girls are giant nerds, only they still manage to make that part of cute.<br />
<br />
Aside from the genre stalwarts like hot springs and the beach we got locations like precious stone and space museums, as well as warm summer nights out spent staring though a telescope. The characters make a lively bunch, and it doesn&#039;t feel like any one in particular hogs the spotlight, which is good. It&#039;s typical lackadaisical anime where nothing is overly dramatized and there isn&#039;t some enemy the characters are united against,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331289">
        nor some kind of supreme hurdle they must overcome. They&#039;re together because it&#039;s nice to have friends. Their interests aside (nerd!), I&#039;d say they manage to hold interest, and it&#039;s an easy watch whether you&#039;re half asleep or half awake while so.
