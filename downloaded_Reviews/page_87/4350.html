    &quot;Be careful what you wish for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Higurashi Gou and Sotsu are exactly what people mean when they say that phrase.  I love Higurashi, but admittedly the original adaptation has aged poorly. I always wanted to see one of my favorite stories remade. And now that it finally has gotten a reboot, I wish it hadn&#039;t been. <br />
<br />
Over a decade after the original anime aired, they have resurrected the franchise for no reason other than profit. Gou was purposefully mismarketed as a remake to attract curious new viewers—then it rebranded itself as a sequel to get the old fandom&#039;s attention. Occasionally it had scary moments, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419013">
        it never proved why it should exist. Sotsu is supposedly the &quot;answer arcs&quot; but it is 90% reused footage with slight alterations. <br />
<br />
These reboots focus specifically on Rika and Satoko. Rika wants to leave Hinamizawa and go to a prestigious high school. Satoko dreams of staying in Hinamizawa forever, but she will not let Rika leave. What ensues is endless torture porn. With the help of an enigmatic spirit, Satoko gains the same looping ability as Rika. Every time they enter a new loop, a comically evil version of Satoko makes Rika suffer as much as possible. The end goal is for her to give up her dreams of escaping. That&#039;s it. That&#039;s your 39 episodes in a nutshell. I could end the review here, but we need to discuss what turned this from a lukewarm spin-off to the worst thing that has ever happened to When They Cry.<br />
<br />
Higurashi&#039;s first two seasons were a nicely completed story. There&#039;s no reason to watch Gou. I only finished it because I wanted to see what would happen to my favorite characters. Sotsu had the same problem, and it failed to justify its existence. Supposedly, these anime are the bridge between this series and Umineko, but it would be less exhausting to read a Wikipedia summary. There&#039;s a common argument that this show can&#039;t possibly be crap because Ryukishi07, the original visual novel author, co-wrote the show&#039;s script! That&#039;s a pretty awful excuse; I shouldn&#039;t have to explain why, but I will. Writers mess up from time to time. Sometimes they lose their spark altogether. Have you ever heard of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? George Lucas co-wrote the script, and it ended up being the worst received film in the franchise. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing new here; Keichi, Rena, Mion, and Shion have the same character arcs, except their personalities are stripped to outlines of their former selves. In terms of character development, do you remember Satoko&#039;s abusive uncle? Well, they gave him a redemption arc! Great work, guys. The only thing that distinguishes this as a sequel is Satoko&#039;s intervention. She injects various friendly faces with Hinamizawa Syndrome, the virus that causes psychosis. There&#039;s no deeper meaning for why the loveable cast of maniacs loses their grip on reality—wacky old Satoko pulls the strings. Water down themes from the original to act as set dressing; cycles of abuse, cultural preservation, evil government, harmful traditions, etcetera. The new theme is a shallow &#039;good versus bad&#039; conflict. No nuance, Rika is the good guy because she wants to save everyone. Satoko is the big bad because she will kill anyone to keep Rika from escaping. Satoko turns from an abuse victim to faking getting abused to manipulate her friends. This sharp turn into foul territory makes me question the sincerity of the anti-child abuse messages in the original. Even with a stellar presentation, this would&#039;ve still been an unengaging turd, but that&#039;s not good either.<br />
<br />
The directing deserves its fair share of criticism too. Higurashi has always used tonal shifts to its advantage; half of the show is upbeat slice-of-life with family-friendly comedy. At the drop of a hat, it could turn sinister—Rena curses Keichi under her breath, then returns to her happy-go-lucky self. The reboots utilize this same technique to build tension, except WAY too much. It&#039;s cool to see Satoko go berserk after two whole seasons of her being the sane one. But we get it. She&#039;s bloodthirsty, evil, and manipulative. You don&#039;t need to beat us over the head with it every two seconds. At least Satoko&#039;s voice actress is trying, and that&#039;s all I&#039;ll say. I don&#039;t object to using violence in a horror anime. In Gou and Sotsu, I frequently wondered why the gore was there, just as I questioned why the rest of the show was there. Why use so much violence when Higurashi&#039;s strength was creating tension and shock without it? Sure, it has always had its fair share of violence, but they used it sparingly. Gou and Sotsu are filled to the brim with serial killers, stranglings, bloody knives, shootings, and immolations. In Gou, they censored it. Sotsu uncensored much of the carnage. I&#039;d say it&#039;s better to watch it as a slasher thriller, but it gets trite quickly. You can only watch so many crazy people go on murderous rampages before it gets mind-numbingly banal.<br />
<br />
I love Higurashi because no matter how many times I watch it, I notice new details. It foreshadows its twists; you can predict they&#039;re coming, but rewatching it will feel all the more rewarding. Sotsu and Gou are not like this. Their narratives are a means to get to shocking scenes. They never considered if the twists would linger with the audience. The most foreshadowing in both seasons is in the opening credits. Both seasons have dubstep theme songs that do not fit the show at all. The new art style doesn&#039;t work either. Sure, Studio Deen&#039;s adaptation left a lot to be desired, but it was an artistic representation of the mundane cute slice of life contrasted with violence for shock factor. They could&#039;ve achieved the same effect with an art style similar to the visual novel remakes. Instead, they went with something generic. The use of visual effects, like CGI flames, was distractingly cheap.<br />
<br />
Higurashi Sotsu could&#039;ve been a two-hour movie—cut out the recaps, all that&#039;s left is Satoko screaming and people going crazy. It is a grossly mismarketed and unwatchable sequel. Unless you have seen every season of Higurashi (16+ hours) and read the Umineko no Naku Koro ni novels (110+ hours), do not bother watching these. The final arc of Gou set up an intriguing premise, but Sotsu never had a payoff. Even diehard When They Cry fans will be disappointed with the direction it takes. If you must see how it ends, start from episode 14 of Sotsu. It becomes Dragon Ball, equipped with neon color battles, super strength, and fighting that&#039;d better suit a kids cartoon if you removed all the blood splatters. <br />
<br />
Gou and Sotsu regurgitate as much of the imagery we expect from Higurashi as possible. It successfully drew the attention of long-time fans, only to waste our time on an absolutely meaningless sequel. The few effectively staged gory scares provide passing entertainment, but the rest is bland and tedious. The brief burst of spontaneous insanity in the final episode of Sotsu serves as the last gasp of air for this decaying, mutilated corpse of a franchise. Yet I doubt we&#039;ve seen the last of When They Cry.

    Full Sotsu Review from the perspective of a longtime When they cry fan.<br />
<br />
Where do I start?<br />
<br />
*Warning* Heavy spoilers ahead!<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 1/10<br />
<br />
The biggest disappointment to my parents since me. Everything was handled poorly and with sub par quality.<br />
<br />
Higurashi is a story about friendship. Cringy as it may be that&#039;s what Higurashi always has been. I will go into methodical and surgical detail dissecting why Higurashi SotsuGou is the worst iteration of its series, a horrible sequel and a horrible stand alone.<br />
<br />
The first Arc of Sotsu is Onikaashi. Focusing on our favourite girl Rena Ryuugu. You know what else focuses on Rena? That&#039;s right, Tsumiboroshi. Onikaashi is nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419025">
        but a poor man&#039;s Recap of Tsumiboroshi, without any of the good stuff included. We already know who Rena is, we already know how she works, Onikaashi adds nothing to the character. These 3 episodes can be skipped without any consequence. Let&#039;s not forget to mention the fact that most of this is made out of recaps. The experienced WTC fan gets no information of any worth from this.<br />
<br />
Second Arc is Watakashi. Focusing on Mion. This is a poor man&#039;s version of Meakashi. Hands down. None of Mions character is expounded on. It just makes her a another version of Shion. The possibilities for L5 Mion were endless, none of that was made use of. What we did get was Rika getting shoved down a toilet (the funniest scene of this show NGL) and more recaps. It&#039;s also worth noting the inconsistent nature of L5 in Sotsu here, because in the Original Series the drug Takano had, would drive you into a L5 induced death in a few hours, not days. It&#039;s a weird retcon, that I&#039;m not sure should exist within the series, since it causes contradictions in previous arcs. Food for thought.<br />
<br />
Tatarikashi, More Recaps baby! You get a recap, and you get a recap! Everybody take this recap and shove it up your - alright alright, I&#039;ll calm down. Honestly though, you should have some questions when the show redeems a child abuser (and a possible rapist) and then goes one step further and has a child faking abuse for the lols. Satoko manipulates Keichii hard in this ep. She has zero empathy for her friends. Funnily enough, Satoko starts feeling regret when she kills Teppei, why she didn&#039;t feel any guilt when she injects her friends is beyond me, so don&#039;t ask me. Either way she bashes K1. Then it reveals that the Teppei Hallucination thing we saw in Gou never happened (This was the only part we couldn&#039;t answer after Gou) I STRONGLY believe that this scene only exists to throw people off and make people think that a deeper mystery exists where it doesn&#039;t. It actively comes off as an underhanded and manipulative.<br />
<br />
Then everything goes to hell. Alright alright get this. Rika remembers that Satoko was the big bad BECAUSE - She has someone else&#039;s memories! How? WHY? Who knows, it never happens before and it doesn&#039;t happen since. Its a Deus ex machina. The plot literally came to Rika. If this is not bad enough. The big suspenseful moment from the end of Gou - the Gun scene. Ends with Satoko shooting Rika - it sucks. The major buildup from Gou, the perrenial Cliffhanger ended just like that, once again this feels like underhanded storytelling.<br />
<br />
Cue the next ep. Rika and Satoko go supah Seiyan! (This is not a witch Battle btw, to read Umineko if you want to see how that really looks like.)<br />
PS - It&#039;s nothing like this. Mainly because Witches don&#039;t ever fight up close. Never. Not even Lambda and Bern.<br />
<br />
They fight some more across different Fragments. Then finally Rika and Satoko end up in a bridge. With the McGuffin Sword in Rikas hands. Rika throws it into the river. Hanyuu gets it. Cracks Eua&#039;s horns, turns her into a Loli, sends her back to whence she came (a black cloud, probably Lambdadelta)<br />
<br />
Rika and Satoko come to an agreement. Rika leaves to St Lucia. Everybody is happy. Satoshi wakes up. They play dear you just to give you the middle finger one last time before you go and it&#039;s over.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t wonder how Satoshi got up when he was in a medically induced coma, the series doesn&#039;t respect its own rules anymore.<br />
<br />
This is pathetic storytelling. Much of the story revolved around a McGuffin Sword that literally turned into a Deus ex Machina at the end. Let&#039;s not forget that Satoko gets her neck cut with the McGuffin Shard and nothing happens! The story doesn&#039;t respect its own rules, why should we? If we can&#039;t trust the story to pay respect to the rules that it itself laid down, how can someone trust the story to be consistent. The 5 loop until death proclamation that Rika did, and Satoko ending up in a world without Rika, were unfortunately badly planned attempts by Passione to up the stakes. To create tension and excitement.<br />
<br />
The mirror world references Passione put in are the same, poor attempts to create excitement within a shallow story.<br />
<br />
If that wasnt enough insults, Higurashi Mei, Higuashis Gacha game, explains some of the finer details in the Gacha game of all things.<br />
<br />
Hopefully by now you can understand how bad SotsuGou&#039;s story is . However I only scratched the tip of the iceberg. The sins of SotsuGou&#039;s story are so terrible that I can write a book about it, and still have a lot left to say. However for our sanity, it&#039;s best we move on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Artstyle  6/10 <br />
<br />
Whether you prefer the rounded Artstyle that this shares with Mei is fully up to you. I won&#039;t go into detail here because this is based on taste and nothing else. Although personally I would have preferred Alchemist&#039;s Character designs to appear. Since they maintain a good balance between Ryuukishis original designs and traditional anime character standards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Music 3/10 <br />
<br />
The DEEN Higurashi Anime is well known for its stellar use of music. Using a combination of VIsual Novel and Original tracks, it handles this perfectly.<br />
<br />
Sotsu on the other hand, has no good music to call it&#039;s own. Much of the OST becomes background noise. I can&#039;t name one price of the OST that I like. It&#039;s really unfortunate.<br />
<br />
Dear You is a song that is supposed to represent the bonds between the cast, in the context of SotsuGou however it comes off an insult when its the send off to a story that featured little of Mion, Keichii and Rena, along with the fact that Satoko actively kills and harms them. <br />
<br />
Dear You ~ SotsuGou ~ is the last sad moans of this Anime. Doing it&#039;s best to hang in to relevance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation 4/10 <br />
<br />
This is another place where SotsuGou struggles in. DEEN used dynamic camera angles, positioning to deliver a more fluid animation experience. Sotsu on the other hand mostly used shot -reverse shots which get boring. The actual character animation also leaves a lot to be desired. Character Animation was something DEEN struggled with sometimes as well, but unlike what DEEN, Sotsu can not fall back on its dark backgrounds as a clutch.<br />
<br />
For their credit Passione used some of the budget for the big DBZ and Naruto crossover scenes at the end. So that&#039;s commendable at least. Good job Passione, give yourself a pat on the back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters 1/10 <br />
<br />
Rika Furude<br />
<br />
You know that this is bad when Rikas VA is confused about what&#039;s going on. In the original VN. Rika was the one who was emotionally dependant on Satoko. Not here however, because in SotsuGou &#039;le tables have turned on ye&#039;. Satoko for some reason can&#039;t live without Rika. Why? How did this happen? Who knows? Don&#039;t get me wrong, Rika and Satoko were always close but Rika is the one who has a panic attack when she doesn&#039;t get Satoko, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s not forget that Rika ignores everything that happened in Matsuri. Her lesson there was;<br />
<br />
&#039;Waiting for things to go her was pointless. If she wanted to win, she had to roll up her sleeves and actually work for the future she wanted&#039;<br />
<br />
In SotsuGou she proceeds to ignore everything going on and gives random cryptic advice to K1. What happened to Rika? Eua must have taken some of her brain cells because nothing else can explain this. HECK, the idiot waits until Nekodamashi to check on Takano, ON TAKANO, the person that&#039;s supposedly gonna kill her and everybody she loves.<br />
<br />
In the original one of Rikas goals was a world with EVERYONE she cared about all her friends and didn&#039;t want a world without them. Rika here decides to screw everybody else and stay with Satoko.<br />
<br />
This is peak character butchering. Rika was only passive when she had given up, however in SotsuGou she&#039;s like that from the very beginning. <br />
<br />
<br />
Satoko Houjou<br />
<br />
The biggest tragedy (or comedy) of Sotsu. Satoko is a character with a fairly good understanding of others and someone who is capable of empathizing with even the worst of people. Here however she&#039;s turned into a one note evil girl with zero redemption (they didn&#039;t even try)<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s look at what SotsuGou tells us about Satoko;<br />
- Has no problem with killing her friends, not only Rika.<br />
- Can forgive Teppei for abusing and hurting her and Satoshi but cant forgive Rika for some reason.<br />
- Knows about all of Rikas loops but cant sympathise with why Rika might want to leave Hinamaizawa.<br />
- Only felt Regret qhen killing Teppei (lol) but not her friends.<br />
- Has no qualms about injecting innoncents like Akasaka and old man Kimiyoshi.<br />
- Tricks K1 and screws him over in Tatari.<br />
- Injects Mion, the most neutral and stable person in the group. For no reason than the lols.<br />
- Rolls around in the ground laughing like an idiot.<br />
- Falls victim to Euas goading.<br />
- Kills her own regrets in Tatarikashi.<br />
- Dodges sword strikes with the speed of a ninja? how? Who knows? <br />
- Has no trauma for Teppei or Takano but somehow is traumatised by a BOX. Bloody hell if a box punch is all it takes, why is she not kneeling over for Rena. Who packs a meaner punch?<br />
- Undergoes zero redemption or development.<br />
- Gets forgiven by Rika with zero consequences.<br />
<br />
The Eagled eyed reader might have noticed something interesting. <br />
&quot;Hey Coulomb, why doesn&#039;t Satoko or Rika have any character development?&quot;<br />
Because they don&#039;t. The show didn&#039;t give them any.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s really tragic is, that Miotsukushi, an alternative ending arc did more for Satoko in two screens than Sotsu did in two seasons!<br />
<br />
Hopefully overall you can realise how bad Satoko&#039;s characterisation is.<br />
<br />
The WORST part about Satoko and and Rika is that they never resolved their conflict by themselves, the club basically stepped into force them back together. It&#039;s poor writing.<br />
<br />
Overall 3/10<br />
<br />
Not worth your time. Read the Manga for a better experience, but avoid the anime. If you are a new fan watch the 2007 Original + Kai, I gurantee my life, that it will be magnitudes more satisfying than this.  That is all.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Retrospect ......<br />
<br />
&quot;When they cry, I laugh.&quot; - The Messiah, Ryuukishi 07. (I&#039;m not sure if he actually said this I just think it&#039;s relevant)<br />
<br />
Higurashi and even Umineko had a theme of protecting children. Preserving childhood. However SotsuGou completely turned this message on its head , and gave us something else. Doesn&#039;t this entire thing make Ryuukishi 07 a bit of a hypocrite? I can accept many things - but when you start redeeming child abusers and rapists that&#039;s where I draw the line. In many ways I think death of the author is applicable here.<br />
<br />
BT, bless his soul. He was more important than you would think. Higurashi originally was planned to have Irie as the villain, however BT felt that it was a bad idea so he made Ryuukishi change it. BT is no longer with us, and I wonder if anyone at 07th expansion atleast try to keep Ryuukishis ideas in check.<br />
<br />
Ryuukishi is a man of many ideas, and by his own admission is someone who gets influenced a lot ( he wanted to make Keichii fight aliens in Tsumiboroshi because he had watched an alien movie) so why he doesn&#039;t have anyone to &#039;filter&#039; his ideas I beyond me.<br />
<br />
Higurashi Mei still exists, and ironically has a better story than Sotsu. There&#039;s also Ciconia. However since it&#039;s reception has been poor even among WTc fans, I wonder where thing will go next.<br />
<br />
Higurashi is 07th expansions most popular series. Umineko only has a faction of it&#039;s popularity, and Ciconia is virtually unknown. Was it worth harming your most well regarded series for no reason other than money?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s honestly best if each WTC remains separate. Connected universes may be cool, but in regards to WTC it just causes more issues than it&#039;s worth, and probably will hamper Ryuukishis creativity. They should never be connected.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Do NOT watch this series. Whether you’re a fan of the Higurashi series or have never watched it before, do whatever it takes to avoid this at all costs.<br />
<br />
The idolized Higurashi franchise, being part of the 07th Expansion series, is well-known for its blend of intriguing murder mysteries, conspiracies, and gripping horror / thriller vibes, juxtaposed befittingly with comedic lighthearted slice-of-life moments. Seven years after its last installment, the acclaimed creator Ryukishi07 was apparently either under some complicated contractual obligations or was in desperate need of easy revenue. So he decided to drop a new project advertised as a remake, except it turned out to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419005">
        be...an actual sequel. Countless nostalgic fans jump on the bandwagon in anticipation and delight for what this new installment has to offer. Instead, what we got here is a near-perfect epitome of what happens when one milks their own acclaimed and renowned franchise to the bone. While I’m not the biggest fan of Higurashi myself, I had my share of due respect for the original series. So when I look at this abomination and the previous season known as Gou, all I can really think was...what in the actual god damn hell was Ryukishi07 thinking? I heard people praising and defending this new installment with overly conceited and convoluted explanations; I bought none of that nonsense, and neither should you or anyone else.<br />
<br />
Higurashi Sotsu is the sequel to the events in Gou; interestingly enough, the name of the two combine to make the Japanese term “Sotsugou”, meaning “graduation”. Regardless of whether or not that was intentional, this sure wasn’t the commemoration ceremony anyone expected or wanted. To start off, it’s stated as a followup to Gou, but it’s essentially more like a tweaked recap. Most of Sotsu consisted of reiterated content of what we’ve already seen in the original series and in Gou, with only slight differences. All the arcs progress in a similar way and all the answers are presented upfront with without any sense of mystery whatsoever. There’s no mystery. There’s no sense of intrigue or engagement. In fact, it quickly become a boring and inept cycle. The slight deviations aren’t changing the fact that we’re essentially experiencing the same damn thing over and over again. Focus may be shifted at times; sometimes to Rena, sometimes to Keiichi, sometimes to Mion. One of the fortitudes of Higurashi is that it’s able to highlight its characters in a reasonable way to make their arcs feel well-earned and impactful. None of that is present here in Sotsu. Everything feel recycled excessively to the point where nothing matters. The arcs finish void of emotion and progress. The one venture with giving some form of redemption to the likes of the initially despicable Teppei Houjou, Satoko’s abusive uncle and foster father, didn’t matter much in hindsight, if at all.<br />
<br />
The only thing that we need to know is that one single revelation (if you want to call it that): Satoko is now the villain of the series. I can’t comprehend the need to make her the bad guy. What exactly did she do in the original series that would warrant or foreshadow her actions in Gou and now here in Sotsu? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Her reasoning to be antagonize and torture her friend Rika is so silly in context when you step back and realize what it is: that fact that Rika broke her promise to spend time with her in high school. The audacity to make this the main plot device and excuse for Higurashi’s version of the Endless Eight is astounding. Satoko thinks that her former friend should suffer a century’s worth of looping endless torture and mindless suffering, all because she overlooked a single vow between besties. This isn’t clever or engaging writing, this is just a silly and contrived interpersonal drama filled with heaps of misery porn. To add to the bedlam of ridiculousness, Satoko has those supernatural looping powers similar to that of Rika, given to her by some randomly inserted literal god character named Eua, whose looks and design are an obvious straight rip from the Umineko sister series. Her sole reasoning to enjoy observing the suffering of others inferior to her. Her motives and role to the story are so vague and muddled, only serving to add some fake sense of mystery to her, when she’s ironically just a mere engine to fuel the repetitiveness and recycling of the conflict. Seriously, what’s the deal with the need to add one-note pompous antagonists like this? If anyone has remembered how the original concluded its narrative impressively, you can despair now. Gou and Sotsu wasted away all of that. Nearly everything from the main story arcs is recontextualized. All of Rika’s efforts and development from before this unnecessary edition is essentially done away. There were no improvements or positive implications; instead, we’re given new issues instead. And as if to add more salt, Ryukishi07 decides to have a climax in the form of….a Dragonball Super battle? A ripoff of Naruto vs Sasuke? Seriously, I kid you not, everything gets truly tossed out the window from the top floor for the sake of magic battles and roid-rage clashes through loops and timelines that would make the likes of Beerus and Itachi shake their heads in disbelief. When the dust finally settles with your typical Hollywood epilogue, it&#039;s as if everything is simply back to normal; one can only ask if this was any bit worth the effort. If this was somehow a ploy to connect Higurashi with Umineko, then why go through all this pointless trouble to begin with? If anything, that would only serve to further adulterate the context of Higurashi as a whole.<br />
<br />
The art of Gou and Sotsu is absolutely atrocious. I understand that Studio Deen wasn’t the best back then and especially not now, but they were still able to capture the enticing, thrilling, and dreary tone and atmosphere of the original story. Here with Gou and Sotsu, we got Passione, a studio who’s only known for making shows heavy with fanservice, which include the likes of the infamous Interspecies Reviewers. The overly bright and flashy modernized color palettes make the animation look stiff and cheesy. The Monogatari-like character designs are too fickle a combination. The thing is that the Monogatari series does have mystery and suspense as well, but it doesn’t focus so much on horror aspects like the Higurashi series does. Akio Watanabe’s Shaft-born style just doesn’t mesh well with the more melancholic identity and tone of the latter. Instead it makes the characters look goofy, dumpy, and hard to take seriously, like they’re the typical gag characters right out of a pure ecchi slapstick comedy. I’m not gonna lie, Gou and Sotsu would’ve come off more like a completely original show if you pretended to be blind. With all those saturated color gradients and highlights courtesy of Passione, it looks like something right outta Anime PornHub. Even with the most violent scenes, body parts and organs straight up look like spilled candy and blood genuinely could’ve been mistaken for fruit juice. It can still look unnerving to most people, I’m sure...cause I can agree that spilled food can look disgusting with the given conditions. Jokes aside, Passione’s aesthetics are far more befitting for a hentai show than a series driven by serious tension, drama, and mystery like Higurashi.<br />
<br />
I’m not gonna say too much about the music and sound design. The opening theme is hilariously unfitting. I don’t really understand the reasoning to choose some random dubstep-esque soundtrack for a series like this other than some unspecified business reason. The ending theme and the insert song at the final episode aren’t anything special and quite forgettable, but at least they somewhat fit. The background music is mediocre at best; the only time the sound gets good is when they reuse tracks from the original. The voice acting department is really a struggle here, with Yuki Tamura at least making a valiant solo effort to channel Rika’s emotional beats.<br />
<br />
The character department took the biggest blow in Sotsu. Back in the original story, the ensemble cast of Higurashi had a great sense of bonds due to their numerous interactions and shared growth. As much as I never really liked them, their ability to link to each other is so commendable and impressive and functioned as a main engine for Higurashi’s story more often than not. But in Gou and now especially here in Sotsu, all those positive and respectable aspects of the characters are snatched away, as they are merely reduced to toys for Satoko to mess around with during her plot for revenge. Defiled and desecrated, they’re turned into robots made to kill each other endlessly. For what? Why exactly do they deserve this? Why is Ryukishi07 undoing his beloved characters like this? While all of this is happening, Satoko continues to be the irritating cartoon level villain. Again, what’s with the random decision of making Satoko the bad guy in the first place? You’d think it would show a methodical descent into madness for her, but it doesn’t. Despite all those times she does something utterly awful to those close to her, she shows no signs of letting up or changing in any notable way like showing remorse or anything. Meanwhile, that Eua character is merely there to find pleasure in her observation of how twisted Satoko and nothing else, only acting when someone tries to intervene. Rika herself is tragically regressed to a stale typical “queen bee student” archetype and does nearly next to nothing about Satoko’s jealousy-driven actions until she finally decides to put the plug, which unfortunately simply leads to that ludicrous showcasing we see in the penultimate episode. Something else about Rika also really bugged me: why did she bother dragging Satoko along to the same school in the first place, only to end up breaking that promise, anyways, as stated earlier? I can only see this as another ridiculous plot convenience to start up Satoko’s malicious actions in the first place. It’s funny how the only remotely decent character work here involved Teppei of all people, and yet even that little development is a mere detour with minimal purpose. Everyone else cannot be considered characters at all, they’re just there to be moved as the plot demands it. Ryukishi07’s character writing here has truly fallen off the deep end here in Sotsu, and the series pretty much loses the strongest aspect of the story.<br />
<br />
For my personal enjoyment, it’s safe to say that I absolutely hated the experience. As stated before, I wasn’t a fan of the original Higurashi to begin with, but Passione’s installment has been disgraceful to behold. I stuck through Gou and Sotsu to see if any decent revelation or development would turn up, but for the most part, it was a snoozefest at best. At the very least, Gou did have a few interesting things to observe at the time, but I got none of that here in Sotsu, on the other hand. Words couldn’t properly describe how infuriating it was to see Satoko channel her inner Scooby-Doo villain on a regular basis. Repeatedly. Over and over. Many times I lost my temper and many times I shook my head and laughed in disbelief. Not once did I feel fear or suspense, only disgust and some laughs...not from the lighthearted slice of life humor, but more from the derpiness of the bright, and flashy violent scenes. I personally don’t see how people can get easily creeped out by something like that. When it finally reached the point where Ryukishi07 had essentially ran out of ideas and went for some shounen-style battle, I was completely besides myself.<br />
<br />
Like the Gou season, Higurashi Sotsu is an obnoxious cash-grab sequel that should’ve never existed in the first place. Riddled by ridiculous plot devices, redundant and repetitive plotting, utter disrespect of its characters, and a complete lack of purpose, it was one of the worst things I’ve ever watched in recent years. All it did was violate and disregard so much of the impressive groundwork that the original series by Studio Deen established with much care. It is completely worthless and added nothing beneficial or substantial in value to the 07th franchise. If you’re a fan and truly care for the Higurashi series, please stick to the original series by Deen and steer clear of this blasphemy. Otherwise, it’ll have you feeling extremely frustrated, dismayed, and betrayed in the end.

    If you have never watched Higurashi before, don&#039;t watch this. If you are a fan of Higurashi, though, run away from it as fast as you can.<br />
<br />
Seven years after the last installment in the Higurashi anime series, the acclaimed author Ryukishi07 is gravely in need of money again and presents you his latest work in the form of a remake——But wait, what&#039;s this? You have been oh-so-grossly deceived! In truth, it&#039;s the sequel you never asked for. New Higurashi must mean new, intricating murder mysteries, conspiracy plots and funny slice of life moments, right? If you are looking for either of these things, you won&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414049">
        find them in the cluster of mediocrity that is Sotsugou.<br />
<br />
Art - 1/10<br />
<br />
You must have heard of the dubious reputation of studio Deen. You might have come across several of the funny, exaggerated faces that the original graced us with. Putting aside the common complaints, it is without a doubt that studio Deen managed to capture the chilling, suspenseful, melancholic atmosphere of Higurashi perfectly with their dull colors and character designs. This time around, we have a new studio on board. Studio Passione bands together with the famous character designer Akio Watanabe (already sounding like a strange combination for such a series) to give you a modern, flashy, bright and plastic look of these characters. This drastic change of style means to signify a new beginning of Higurashi, making it unrecognizable in its efforts.<br />
<br />
I could have passed Sotsugou off as another anime original if I hadn&#039;t focused on it clearly. But no, this is meant to be the same Higurashi you were once scared by when you were 12. With colorful gradients, saturated colors and highlights, studio Passione absolutely fails to deliver suspense and dramatism artistically in any form (aside from Gou Ep. 16).<br />
<br />
Everyone has a cat mouth. Keiichi looks like a ladyboy. Rika looks like she has FAS. Satoko looks mostly fine, and I will tell you why——because Ryukishi, in his own words, hired Watanabe precisely because he could draw Satoko the cutest way. Okay, an entire series focusing on Satoko. An odd choice, but I see where he&#039;s coming from, given that she was previously the main character with the least amount of spotlight. I wonder what kind of traps and practical jokes the prankster is up to this time?<br />
<br />
Story - 0/10<br />
<br />
The first three arcs progress similarly to the respective ones in the original, although there are divergences. As boring as you might expect after having seen the same story four times. Gee, have you heard of Oyashiro-sama&#039;s curse, mayhaps?<br />
<br />
Some Sotsugou spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, the answers are played as straight as possible in fear of slightly challenging the new viewers. There is no mystery. Everything is just as you think it is. The one single twist in Sotsugou is what truly drives this to the ground——SURPRISE! Satoko may now be EVIL.<br />
<br />
Suddenly we meet with the literal god of the WTC-verse, totally-not-Umineko-san. She bestows upon Satoko godlike looping power for no apparent reason and plugs in several names of characters from other Ryukishi works. Wondering what that is about? Go buy the author&#039;s other visual novels to find out.<br />
<br />
Satoko decides to use her newfound power not to memorize the answers on her tests and become the new queen bitch of St. Lucia, but to recreate Rika&#039;s century of despair in order to mentally break her into submission. All because Rika broke the promise of spending her every second with Satoko in high school. Rika lied to Satoko once in a hundred years, and she needs to be punished through another hundred years of death and torture in order to change her mind into staying in Hinamizawa forever. The ending the original had built up has been thrown out the window as simply as that.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I was never a fan of Matsuribayashi and I believe there are many issues with it, one of them being Satoko&#039;s character. I can make a guess that Sotsugou was meant to &quot;fix&quot; Matsuribayashi by addressing these issues, but it&#039;s introducing more issues rather than fixing anything.<br />
<br />
Character - 0/10<br />
<br />
All these characters you have spent reading about in a game with the length equivalent of the Harry Potter series have been reduced to Satoko&#039;s playthings. Disgraced. Made to kill each other through the unlimited power of the Coronavirus vaccine. You mean to make me believe that in the blink of an eye Satoko became a coldhearted psychopath who doesn&#039;t care about seeing her friends die, even going as far as to humiliate and finish Mion off by shoving a fired up gun into her bullet wound? There was enough time to execute Satoko&#039;s &quot;descent to madness&quot; smoothly, but instead we get her watching Rika&#039;s entire looping life in a few seconds without even a flinch. Your enjoyment of this boils down to whether you like seeing the blonde gremlin do evil things to your beloved characters because she didn&#039;t like school.<br />
<br />
After the grand reveal, you continuously follow Satoko as she sets free her inner cartoon villain. She does the evil red eyes. You clap and cheer, &quot;I hope she does it again!&quot; And she does something utterly mischievous and evil to her friends and family again, five minutes later. The episode ends with one shot of Deus-Ex-Machina declaring how truly amusing and entertaining Satoko is. There you have the first three arcs of Sotsu, and I assure you that this is not an exaggeration.<br />
<br />
The only characters with something going on about them are Satoko, Rika and Teppei, everyone else is not a character. Rika falls right into her queen bee personality at the new school, becoming a full-fledged snob who does nothing but drink tea and get her cunt licked by her clique while Satoko watches through a window because she&#039;s not pretentious enough to be invited. Sounds like a lesbian soap drama setup, right? Are you not intrigued? Too bad, that is the entire conflict of Sotsugou. As always, Rika&#039;s goal is to escape death, but this time, going to the rich girl school and necessarily bringing Satoko along are also parts of it. She can&#039;t simply let Satoko live her own life because the obsession plot couldn&#039;t have been initiated that way. Rika&#039;s character ends here.<br />
<br />
For Teppei to be the only interesting character, the character writing must truly have hit the bottom.<br />
<br />
Sound - 3/10<br />
<br />
Dubstep openings one after the other, unfitting for this series. The music is only good when they reuse soundtracks from the original. Satoko&#039;s VA is visibly struggling to portray her young voice and it&#039;s not quite pleasant to the ears. Yukari Tamura is the saving grace.<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this compares to The Last of Us in terms of franchise massacres. As a fan of Higurashi it makes me ashamed to see this. Much like most cash-grab sequels, Sotsugou should not have existed. It was made so that the author could make money from the gacha game and merch and so he could advertise his other visual novels. It is entirely pointless and in the end will return to the status quo. It doesn’t deserve your time.<br />

    - This Review contains spoilers -<br />
<br />
Talking about Sotsu is really hard...<br />
<br />
Going back in time, in 2020 we had the first part of the New Project of the franchise, which at the same time connected events of the original story, serving as a sequel for the anime, promoted a new experience, different from what was already presented.<br />
<br />
It was confirmed that from the beginning Gou was a contradictory season for the show, as it involved a conflict within the very functionality and purpose of what was Higurashi until the end of the canonical arcs adapted from the Visual Novels. What marked the franchise for almost 20 years

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419011">
        was set aside in favor of building a new story. An ambitious move, no? It is hard to think that a story already finished had anything more to tell, but honestly the feeling that Sotsu caused in the end was sadness. <br />
<br />
The first three arcs (Oniakashi, Wataakashi and Tatariakashi), Sotsu oscillated quite a bit. The project really delivered a good start, where the conclusion of the arc in which Rena starred brought great anticipation for what would come next. Wataakashi was different... It was not the same feeling. The perception I had was that the staff had invested their time to start the show, but did not take good care in concluding this whole new phase. During this arc, it was interesting to see Mion being the real culprit in this little mystery. Of course, we can&#039;t forget that in the end the real culprit was always Satoko. When the show gives its plot twist still in Gou, it was expected that Satoko would be put on a pedestal as a villain. Well, that happened. If that&#039;s what the anime wanted, it got it. This idea whereby the show sustained itself injected added scenes with the perspective of Satoko having these &quot;two faces&quot;. However, from here, it has a problem. Possibly the problem that destroyed much of the potential that New Project had.<br />
<br />
From the third arc on (Tatariakashi), I could already see that the show was going to decline. I remember talking to some people about the status of the show during the release of the episodes and I knew that this projection of 15 episodes done the way it was would not be enough. Lack of time? Honestly, no. With 15 episodes it is possible to build a story that would conclude Higurashi, for sure. What prevented that was the time used during each of the parts that solved the mysteries separately. The show did this at the time with the second season. It was a formatting that worked and concluded the series in a positive way. Passione has consistently tried to repeat this, but has not succeeded. Tatariakashi was already a stage where you had both Satoko at her peak of madness, and moments where you didn&#039;t know what she really wanted.<br />
<br />
Moving on, the franchise took steps backwards when it came to identifying the characters. The final conflict caused a sincerely silly fight between St. Lucia and Hinamizawa. Again, the selfishness that possessed Satoko exceeded her understanding with what she herself wanted. Episodes 10 and 11 demonstrate this, where there is a struggle unconsciously within her mind. A person who is already consumed by hatred against someone who still wants to have her life in peace. I didn&#039;t understand what actually occurred with this scene. It was just intriguing and would be a great way to cause Satoko&#039;s own redemption about what she did. But as the following episodes went on, that moment really didn&#039;t do much good. And even if Tatariakashi&#039;s conclusion had been good, the execution of the arc didn&#039;t please.<br />
<br />
Remember what motivated her to do all this? Not wanting to lose her friendship with Rika was a huge desperation inside the character&#039;s heart. And now, she tries to fix it, even if she has to go through several loops and deaths to find the &quot;ideal universe&quot;. Selfish, isn&#039;t it? This possession awakened a parallel personality that would cause more focus on the supernatural part of the series. Eua and Hanyuu were already characters that had this objective of serving as support to make the show&#039;s conclusions easier to reach. It turns out that with Hanyuu, in the original story, the explanations and dramas inserted were answered in a way that caused the interest of those watching. Yes, it&#039;s still a pretty boring way to think about it, but it was a lazy idea. Ryukishi could have brought this story turn around with a little more aptitude. <br />
<br />
With Eua, same thing... It&#039;s really hard to define how far Ryukishi got involved in this original story, but the existence of Eua in the Higurashi universe sparked a problem that would be responsible for the very downfall of the show in the future. This was something that I predicted even in Gou. When there is the addition of an important character to the series, there needs to be a plausible way to contextualize the audience about what is happening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who is Eua?&quot;, &quot;Why did she help Satoko, being that it would apparently be of no benefit to her?&quot;, &quot;What is the purpose of her existing in the franchise?&quot;; honestly, I&#039;m wondering that even now. Of course, it has the famous connections between Umineko and Higurashi, but I prefer to keep my feet on the ground about that. One cannot ignorantly state that assumption that connects the two worlds. Anyone who likes and understands the When They Cry franchise knows that this is a way to bring a more solid connection to culminate in this great universe, but while it&#039;s a good idea, it has displaced the goal of this show.<br />
<br />
Speaking of purpose, what was &quot;Kagurashi&quot;? Four episodes made to conclude the series were not enough. Hanyuu reappearing in the astral world to Eua, Rika discovering that it was Satoko who was to blame for everything, and even the existence of the artifact that has the ability to kill those who live in loops... These issues are good at first glance, but insufficient to bring a conclusion. Since Gou I felt that what limited Hanyuu was already irrationalized. It already happened that she said &quot;this time is our last chance&quot; to Rika. That happened in Matsuribayashi (Kai), for example. The show tried to circumvent that and made Hanyuu have an ability and powers without much realistic explanation. It was not enjoyable, it was not captivating, it was not fun to witness after so many episodes the current fragments happen just &quot;because they did&quot;. <br />
Episode 14? Well, I don&#039;t think the problem with the show was that episode. In fact, it was more intense and was a nice way to bring a conclusion that needed to happen a long time ago. The build up to that stage was creative and I really appreciate the way the show tries to insert the abysmal powers. It was the famous &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; of Higurashi. A compilation of moments that disappointed most, as it was definitely no longer the &quot;Higurashi&quot; that everyone knew. Satoko and Rika awakening a power in a divine way was not really a good choice.<br />
<br />
About the production, it was a factor that hurt the entire show. The amount of scenes brought entirely from Gou became more and more apparent as time went on and made Sotsu a definitive recap, rather than a conclusion. Passione experienced problems in writing a narrative that yielded well for the audience, but did not bring something new. Even with more than a cour of episodes left, it&#039;s still a sense of expectation to have something that was actually enjoyable to watch. Gou&#039;s phase was so interesting. The moments gave a utopian and cathartic awakening for it to have a good execution in the second half of the story. But I feel betrayed. In fact, I feel anguished. Anguished that I have absorbed a franchise that is so important to me and that even though I defended the show&#039;s more negative phases, I couldn&#039;t really like New Project the way I wanted to. The &quot;miracle&quot; that Hanyuu cites so much in the story is not for Rika, but for the project itself. Concluding the story in a good way was like a miracle, and it didn&#039;t happen this time.<br />
<br />
Finally, Higurashi is still a franchise that I love, regardless of their criticisms. But Gou/Sotsu was indigestion. It&#039;s like you eat a whole cake. You&#039;ll be drawn to the temptation and think it&#039;s a good idea, but it won&#039;t be good for your stomach. As much as Sotsu didn&#039;t appeal to me, I can see some quality in it. I don&#039;t view this sequel as totally wasted, but I can&#039;t give it any more enthusiasm and say that it was a good experience.

    At this point in history, I can say that Higurashi is a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. A UNIQUE story, told in a PHENOMENAL way. As a kind of puzzle, of which initially, we only have one piece, and as time goes by, each piece begins to accumulate, and to be placed in the right position, to arrive at the truth.<br />
The basic plot, albeit simple, and in principle suggests a simple slice of life, transforms and develops into something extremely larger, full of mysteries, Gorgeous characters, exciting moments and just as many moments of pure suspense. <br />
This and more, is Higurashi, a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408392">
        story, which, even if it takes place within a large time loop, located in the village of Hinamizawa, manages to convey many messages to the viewer. <br />
<br />
I recommend watching the entire anime, but also to recover the original material, the visual novel in fact, and also the manga. Because, even if they are three different media, in these you You will find the story you already know, reproduced with different details than other media, even substantial changes of certain points in the story, which make the world of Higurashi, Even more vast and immersive, even if it is wonderful.

    This review will not be spoiler free, so please watch Gou and the current 4 episodes of Sotsu before reading this.<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni: Sotsu is sequel to Higurashi Gou, and technically the 5th season of the anime installments. After having a bait and switch with Gou, and resulting in a mixed bag of reactions throughout the entirety of its run: Sotsu had a big role to fill in terms of story, characters and engagement. It had to managed to bring in and lure those fans that didn&#039;t seem to really enjoy Gou, while also satisfying fans that loved it but are hoping for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408456">
        deeper, meaningful connections with other 7th Expansion properties (Umineko and Ciconia). It also had to make the series make more sense for those that watched the series under the impression it was a remake.<br />
<br />
We are currently 4 episodes into Sotsu, so has it managed to deliver so far?<br />
<br />
Not... really.<br />
<br />
I am personally a very big fan of Higurashi and Umineko, and I absolutely loved Gou. Making a series that is both a remake and a sequel is absolutely genius, and equated to a very fun ride. We had so many new reveals for the mystery that seemed to be unfolding, as well major plot twists in its last arc such as Satoko being the reason for the new loops. Eua, who is a carbon copy of Featherine, was a massive twist that no one expected. The season was an absolute blast, and I currently have Gou sitting at a strong 9. <br />
<br />
However, Sotsu, so far, has managed to be a bit of a disappointment.<br />
<br />
Its first answer arc in Oniakashi we already knew a fair bit amount from the trailers and stuff hinted in Gou&#039;s last arc (Satokowashi-hen), but there was still room for some new introductions and story beats. Instead, it was filled with a lot of recap scenes, some instances of plot convenience, and ambiguity that an answer arc shouldn&#039;t be giving us. Satoko ends up using H173 to inject Rena, but the way that this is set up is incredibly odd. <br />
<br />
Rena has a moment where she gazes off, but then suddenly decides to leave the club early and go to the nurses office. This makes sense, and a lot of viewers expected a confrontation between Satoko and Rena. Instead, we are met with a scene where Rena is asleep in the nurses office, and Satoko injects her with H173. This is... ridiculously convenient, and feels like bad writing in all honesty. The dominos set themselves up too perfectly for this to happen, and without Rena waking up at that. <br />
<br />
The next major instance is Rena reacting differently to the injections than Tomitake did. Tomitake clawed his throat out a few hours after being injected from the disease, but Rena manages to survive almost an entire week. Sure, H173 could function differently depending on the host, but it is a strange writing choice to take something that has two to three seasons worth of foundation and suddenly change it. <br />
<br />
Oniakashi is then topped off with the biggest question of that entire arc (Rena vs Keiichi) not having a complete answer. We don&#039;t know if Keiichi hallucinated, we don&#039;t know how Keiichi survived a bunch of stab wounds AND didn&#039;t bleed out, and we don&#039;t know how Rena died from getting hit in the head by an alarm clock. We don&#039;t really know how any of this resolved.<br />
<br />
The entire first arc of Sotsu was just set up in a way that was both unsatisfying and very frustrating for quite a bit of fans of the series, as there are many things that didn&#039;t feel like Higurashi in it. Of course it did bring some benefits, such as a Rina redemption and more background on Rena&#039;s family. Which these were indeed nice additions and helped flesh out the arc a bit more, but it does not make up for its shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Today we started the answer arc Wataakashi-hen, which is the answers for probably the biggest question arc in Gou which was Watadamashi-hen. The first 3/4&#039;s of the episode were phenomenal. We found out something massive regarding Hanyuu, Eua and the fragment world, and we got some extremely important scenes for Satoko. But then... once again, we got back to recaps. I understand that the recaps are there to fill in the audience as to what is happening, but Sotsu only has a 15 episode run time - showing recaps means things will likely be very rushed towards the ending. However, this wasn&#039;t really my issue with this episode.<br />
<br />
My issue was Satoko injecting Mion. I personally believe Mion getting level 5 of the Syndrome would&#039;ve been a very cool thing to see indeed, but the way that it happened was extremely unsatisfying. We see Mion at a vending machine, bent over, and Satoko holding the injection. Then it cuts away, and we see the group together but the syringe on the ground empty. This scene coupled with the ending scene of Watadamashi (with Mion having scratch marks) means Mion was indeed injected, which is honestly extremely ridiculous. <br />
<br />
How on Earth did Satoko manage to inject Mion, without Mion noticing. Rena was asleep when she got injected, and she still winced when the needle went into her - while she was ASLEEP. Mion is fully awake, there is no way in the world she would not notice a syringe going into her body and pumping fluids in her. I know some people are trying to suggest that maybe Satoko spiked her drink, but this makes even less sense. Why would Mion pass her drink to Satoko and then take it back, and when in like the span ofa few minutes would Satoko pour the stuff into Mion&#039;s drink. There is so much grey area here that if this doesn&#039;t get elaborated on, this is going to be a major plot hole. I originally thought it was due to the influence of Eua on the world, and that maybe she was manipulating things but that seems to not be the case due to comments made by Ryu.<br />
<br />
This whole review might come off as nitpicking, but these are really important moments - these injection scenes are the entire reason these arcs happen. The fact that they are happening in really overly convenient ways is ridiculous. Higurashi is a series known for tight-nit writing and its thoroughly thought out story telling, and nothing about these scenes feels tight-nit or thought out. And these scenes are only the worst offenders from this season, there are plenty more issues.<br />
<br />
Could Sotsu turn around, explain all of these things and get better? Yeah. Has Sotsu still been enjoyable besides a lot of the things I pointed out? Yeah. Its just there currently are a lot of small things, that if you think more about will snowball into bigger things. <br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Sotsu so far has been underwhelming. There are many instances of things that are very convenient and feel like cop-outs, many instances of already existing footage being reused, and wacky inconsistencies with past knowledge of other seasons. The series has still managed to be at least enjoyable for majority of the time, but there are really some underlying things that could make the later part of this season suffer.<br />
<br />
Higurashi Sotsu is currently schedule for 15 episodes, which means we have 11 left. Wata is supposed to be 3, Tata is supposed to be 5, and the ending arc is supposed to be 4. Realistically, this is not enough time to wrap up the story that they currently have laid out. If they continue to not explain things and hold recaps in, I am genuinely afraid for the rest of this series as a major fan of Higurashi.

    For those who have not watched this show yet, this anime is based on popular digital novel created by and amateur (refered as &#039;Doujin&#039; in Japan)writer.<br />
<br />
Unlike other anime series, this one splits itself into several stories(arcs). Each arc consists of about 2-5 episodes. All episodes tells the story of main characters(some side characters) encountering different/same/similar events in small countryside village called &#039;Hinamizawa&#039; (This feels like parallel universe setting, after each story ends, good or bad they go back in time and start again but this time something else happens with new characters, and more mysteries are created or answered).<br />
<br />
First few episode of each arc are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408653">
        done average to near horrible (Personal Experience: I almost decided to stop watching the series after half way through the first episode,,,thank god I didn&#039;t!). It&#039;s probably due to the way they made it very &#039;comedial&#039; and some of the ways characters talk, and also how they look.<br />
<br />
However, real excitement usually starts from around mid-second episode. Everything will change dramatically! There are plenty of mystery you can try solve in each story (Later episodes reveals the answers to the mystery, so I recommend watching them in order, it is also hard to solve the mystery with anime version due to lack of details in the story compared to the original novel).<br />
<br />
Voice acting is very well done, Mion/Shion Sonozaki are personal favorite characters, but everyone else does good job of making the overall warm/dark feel of the atmosphere!<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this animation for people who likes mystery, suspense, violence with interesting plots and twists.<br />
<br />
*Added - The same author of this series has released new digital novel called &#039;Umineko no naku koroni (Umineko - Japanese Gull/Black tailed gull)&#039;. &#039;Umineko&#039; is not a direct sequel to &#039;higurashi&#039;, but has similarity to higurashi. It has better character settings in term of &#039;realism&#039; (People are a lot more believable), more serious (less jokes that was less appearing to &#039;serious story&#039; seekers, and still contains a lot of gore. If you understand Japanese, I highly recommend all mystery loving people to read the novel!

Massive spoilers for Higurashi to follow after the next paragraph. If you want my advice, whether you like the series or not, go watch the new one. <br />
<br />
I love this show to the bits. I despise this show to the bone of my soul. Higurashi Sotsu is both the best and the worst anime I have seen in 2021 (and 2020 counting Gou). It is both utterly brilliant and completely insulting, both paying great respect and developing the characters 20 years on in nuanced and intricate ways as well as shitting on them from a great height. It loves the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419007">
        audience and hates them. It is both incredibly frustrating and incredibly gratifying on a weekly basis. It is both these things at the same time. However, because of this there is no good way to reflect this in my score; simply taking the average and giving a 5 is disingenuous and implies the show is mediocre (when it really isn&#039;t). Thus, I will apply the same method Ryukishi07 used in Umineko : To misuse Schrodinger&#039;s Cat and to construct a Cat Box.<br />
<br />
There is one thing you can&#039;t deny going into Gou/Sotsu. In that it is a complete wild ride from start to finish. While the original VN (and Umineko and Ciconia) were works that are to be taken seriously, I cannot see Gou/Sotsu as anything but a black comedy. They hired a comedy director for goodness sake. And from the interviews, the deliberate grindhouse aesthetic chosen for the violent scenes do support this view. It&#039;s moments like the club members playing in a river as Satoko violently stabs Rika in the throat with a blunt fork, or Keiichi and Rena playing knifey-clocky, or that beautiful beautiful Gilligan Cut with Akasaka and Rika, that make me laugh uncontrollably. Unironically, Higurashi has been the best comedy of the whole year, unintentional or not, but I&#039;m willing to give some credit in this department. Just some. <br />
<br />
Gou/Sotsu (Sotsu especially) is what I&#039;d call the accumulation or the perfection of the art of schlock. It is complete madness from a creator who may or may not have genuine distaste for his work, and who takes the chance to laugh at both himself and the audience for going through in this mess. For that, I respect R07 for going through with this vision. Even if he may completely mock me for enjoying Gou/Sotsu.<br />
<br />
To begin dissecting why I think this show deserves both a 1/10 and a 10/10 score at the same time, let&#039;s look at characters. Or less charitably, character assassination. Before moving on, I want to stress that I like Satoko&#039;s new change in character. Her new personality makes sense and is a natural progression of how her character would evolve after the events of Saikoroshi, and tying her to Lambdadelta or Vier from Umineko/Ciconia respectively makes sense on both a design and plot front. Likewise with Rika. Rika has always been a terrible person even in the VNs, so her stubbornness and selfishness are likewise, natural progressions of her character arc from the end of Saikoroshi, and a bridge to her later alter ego as the cynical and cruel Frederica Bernkastel. No, character assassination refers to everyone else (apart from Teppei). Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Shion, even dear Mr Delicious and some of the adults. That is something I can&#039;t easily forgive R07 for. Shion (the one without the tattoo) got the worst of it though. Just her overall patheticness in Watakaashi genuinely made me angry. I just can&#039;t fathom why the previously craziest Yandere of the entire series is reduced to a crying mess in front of a slow moving non-threathening Mion. Teppei on the other hand is the (third) biggest winner in terms of character growth though. I can&#039;t believe R07 made me actually feel sympathy for him 20 years on. Though in hindsight he pulled the same stunt back with Rosa too, but Teppei here seems genuinely remorseful and because of that, you do end up pitying him.<br />
<br />
Now to tackle the plot. Oh boy. While I did like Higurashi as a VN for its atmospheric mystery horror, I will freely admit it eventually relied on a Deus Ex Machina to resolve its plot. Nothing relating to the main themes of trusting your friends ever helped Rika find out the identity of her killer. If we&#039;re going with the Eua is Ryukishi07 analogy, we can see one of the first and clearest deviations is that the sheer concept of a Deus Ex Machina is mocked in its entirety for Gou/Sotsu. And that includes Hanyuu of course, which can also be seen as a stand-in for R07 in his earlier days.  As a writer, I personally find his longer works (Higurashi, Umineko, Rose Gun Days, and to some extent Higanbana) to be excellent, but at the same time his shorter works or his manga ventures are just terrible (I don&#039;t wanna mention Iwaihime ever again, or Loopers). So how does Sotsu fall in this regard? <br />
<br />
For an author who once championed the philosophy of actively trying to solve a mystery even if you&#039;re off the mark, and who deliberately didn&#039;t give explicit solutions to Umineko in Episodes 7 and 8, preferring the viewer to come up with the solutions on their own, it is incredibly disheartening to have most of Sotsu be repetitive recaps of Gou with the most obvious solutions shown in excruciating and unnecessary detail to the viewer. It is tiring and the absolute lowest point in the series for me. It is dead obvious as to the Who, How, and Why of Oni/Wata/Tata, but we really didn&#039;t need to see Satoko slowly stalk her victims and inject them and then once more following the victims as they cause havok. It is so dull and so much of the footage from Gou is recycled. At least when Haruhi did it they reanimated many of the scenes. Here though? By my estimate only 40% of Sotsu is new material, and that includes the final 2 episodes which are past the recap point. And yes, it took 8 whole months for the story to continue. And yet, in spite of this flagrant reuse of content, I ended up going through the same motions at Eua, laughing heartily at every single scene Satoko does her spooky red eyes in. It&#039;s awful but in the best possible way. Or maybe that&#039;s the Stockholm Syndrome kicking in. It is instances like these where I wonder if R07 has contempt for his fans, just stringing us along on this seemingly neverending year-long journey where you do get to feel like Rika being stuck in her endless loops. <br />
<br />
It is also through Higurashi that I have to come to a hard realization, that the original VN&#039;s plot isn&#039;t that good. It is entertaining and I was emotionally moved, yes. But in doing so I had to ignore plot holes and the Deus Ex Machina that completely destroys the whole story in order to provide a happy ending. At the tail end of Matsuribayashi, R07 asks the viewer a graduation question, which to paraphrase is &quot;Is there a way for there to be a happy ending for everyone?&quot;. Gou/Sotsu on the surface seems to try to answer that, but in doing so it establishes connections, that weren&#039;t there in the first place, to the greater WTC series, Umineko and the still-yet-unfinished Ciconia, with Satoko being the lynchpin that holds this House of Cards together. While this does turn Satoko from my most disliked character into my most loved, the consequence of this is that I have put greater importance on the meta-narrative stringing these series together rather than the individual stories themselves. And in retrospect I can&#039;t enjoy the original Higurashi on its own without connecting it to the greater meta-narrative. How it all comes down is still in the air, since the final (?) part of the puzzle is still unreleased.<br />
<br />
Much like with Satoko and her conflicting love and hatred for Rika, I too am in a similar position with Sotsu. The ending to Sotsu reinforces my love AND hate for what has become of Higurashi as a new version of you plays in a beautiful scene as everyone gets a happy ending at last...and yet it also reinforces how R07 refuses to provide an explicit connection to his other works. I mean, if you&#039;re gonna establish a &quot;cinematic universe&quot; of sorts, why not just go all the way and spare us this grief.<br />
<br />
To conclude, there is no easy way to judge Higurashi Sotsu on its own merits. One mustn’t forget that even the original Higurashi has been rereleased several times with several different new arcs penned by different authors and Ryukishi himself, all of varying quality, none matching the original 8 arcs in quality, so in that sense, Gou/Sotsu excel marvelously on that merit alone. BUT, as I had stressed so many times before, it comes at a cost of diluting the original message and spirit of Higurashi in line with connecting it to the greater WTC Series, of which includes an unfinished product. It is both incredibly frustrating and charming at the same time. A myriad of oxymorons in a sealed box. You will never know what you’re gonna get, and the truth is always concealed. All inside a cold uncaring catbox.<br />
<br />
Now everyone, join me in praying for Ryukishi to stop giving excuses and continue writing the rest of Ciconia.<br />
<br />
1/10<br />

The one represents DAIICHI NO COURSE. <br />

    Higurashi Sotsu is a difficult series to rate. Sometimes it’s so ridiculous I want to rate it lower, while other times it’s so ridiculous I want to rate it higher. It doesn’t get to the point where it’s straight out bad, but it has its questionable moments. Gou was already controversial (although I personally really liked it), but Sotsu manages to divide the already divided fanbase even more.<br />
<br />
So, what’s the deal with Sotsu? Keep in mind that what could be considered spoilers is mentioned further, though nothing too major. Nothing too major for Sotsu that is, you shouldn’t read further if you haven’t seen Gou

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419016">
        yet.<br />
<br />
Sotsu is the answer arc for Gou. It shows the events of the previous season through Satoko’s eyes and shows to the audience how the previously mysterious situations came to be. Fairly usual structure for a Ryukishi work. Yet this is already one of the most criticized aspects. Supposedly it’s “just a recap” and “doesn’t move the plot forward”. This is of course untrue, as while it technically covers the same events, the new viewpoint and additional information are the new content and it is moving the plot forward. Admittedly, it could have been done faster and some scenes could be considered an unnecessary repetition, but I still prefer that to rushing through Satoko’s view, and given the theme of looping I’d say the event repetition ads to the atmosphere rather than being a detriment. <br />
<br />
That is 13 out of the 15 episodes. No way the story would be able to finish at this pace, right? Well 14th episode is where shit hits the fan and the pace changes rapidly. And it’s here when I got really conflicted about the series. It’s fun, sure, but sometimes the suspend of disbelief is getting way too close to getting broken, and rule of cool is being used as a device too much. Rule of cool can be, well, cool, but for Higurashi where the plot is supposed to be logically explainable it’s not something to swing around too much. The rapid scene transition from the loop makes for a really cool fight scene, but if you think about it, you remember that Satoko cannot in any of those jumps die as the first one. It seems likely that at this speed and with Rika knowing she needs to defend herself some sort of slip would occur. Some jumps even really look like Satoko could have been the one dying first. Yet the show seems to ignore this possibility entirely. While it’s nice how the fight is jumping through iconic places, it also seems very plot convenient to keep going like that. Things get even more confusing when the sword is involved and keeps being held by the characters even though logically there should have been a need to retrieve it for each new loop. While you could theorize that it’s because the sword is related to the looping powers, I would prefer it if the show itself would hint at that instead of me having to make excuses for it.<br />
<br />
Also, let’s talk about Satoko. Turning one of the main characters into a villain is an interesting idea for sure, but Satoko’s motivation just keeps getting more bullshit. “Sure, you’ve suffered through a century of psychological and physical torture, but I really hate studying, so I’m the victim here”. Yep, just cause more pain to your best friend and others around you to keep said friend bound to a shitty place to which they have traumatized memories tied to. Because you can’t keep up with school even with a literal time looping power and because you’re jealous your friend is making new friends. There’s overreacting, and then there’s this. Excuse my language, but I have no better description of this behaviour as retarded. Now, maybe Satoko is on the spectrum and then it would make sense, but that would again be me making up excuses for the show. The reason Satoko went postal is just so weird and hard to grasp, making her motivation unrealistic and therefore her being a weak villain, and this is pretty much the one reason why I won’t rate Sotsu higher, even though I’m overall enjoying the new sequel in general. And while the finale of original Higurashi had some strong friendship theme so it’s not exactly a sudden element, I’d still prefer it it the power of friendship was toned down a bit. The finale felt quite underwhelming - yet, call if copium if you want to, I&#039;m still hoping for a continuation or a tie-in.<br />
<br />
To contrast this with a positive point, I love what new Higurashi did to Teppei. It’s the exact opposite of Satoko development. Here we have a previously hated character that was simply a violent villain, a dumb dickhead, no redeeming qualities. Then one of the best redemption arcs I’ve witnessed happens. Redemption arc is usually “bad guy is now kinda good because the character was popular with the audience”. Not in this case. Here we have what was considered a lost cause, one of the most hated characters in anime (no hyperbole, check out the lowest ranks of character ratings on AniDB). And he’s given character depth, an actual desire for redemption and realization of the weight of his mistakes. If before 2020 you told me I would feel sorry for Teppei, I wouldn’t be able to take you seriously. But I’m glad it’s how the development ended up and the emotional attachment to the character relationship it caused. Seriously, the dynamics between evil Satoko and redemption Teppei are more interesting than those between Satoko and Rika. Or maybe that could be considered a fault of the show? You be the judge in this case.<br />
<br />
I’ve seen people complaining about the art, but while it’s not breath-taking, it certainly isn’t bad or flawed. It’s definitely better than the DEEN version, but that’s not exactly hard goal to clear.<br />
<br />
I rate this controversial/10. I prefer creators trying new things instead of plain remake, but keep in mind that there is a chance you might be disappointed even if you’re a long time Higurashi fan. And if you’re not interested in Higurashi that much, this might not be interesting to you that much either. Or it might. This is one of those cases where I hesitate to make a verdict whether to recommend this or not in overall. I guess you’ll just have to see for yourself. I’ve you’ve watched Gou already, you might as well finish this anyway, no? If nothing else, you can then engage in heated flamewar with someone that holds the different opinion about this series, and isn’t that what’re we here for?

    After the finale of Higurashi Gou I was very excited to see the crazy places where this plot would go, boy I was wrong. What we ended up with was 13 episodes of recaps of plots that we have already repetitively read and seen 4 times but with a poorly written antagonist shoved into it. And when you finally get past the recaps you might believe that you&#039;ll get rewarded with the good ryukishi plot you came for but that never happens, nothing but pure rubbish.<br />
<br />
I have not been this disappointed in a long time. I expected better from Ryukishi.

    So... Gou happened and we&#039;re half through sotsu and only now we&#039;re back to the same point from which the halfway point happened in gou. It&#039;s very rare to talk about a show thats pacing is obliteratingly slow.<br />
<br />
I have to praise studio passione on the utter balls they have. They managed to stretch the content as thin as possible and make 39 epsiodes out of 12 episodes worth of animation.<br />
<br />
The art style is still really unfitting (and not in a &quot;Subversive&quot; way), though it does have a scene here and there where they actually try something interesting. But for the most part, it is literally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416863">
        the exact same as the previous season.<br />
<br />
Sound is like the previous, not too bad, except i hate having to listen to satoko so much, and oishii for the most part i&#039;m not a fan but I have to commend the performance in his &quot;big moment&quot;. OP sucks again as it comes off as a generic action horror song and I don&#039;t really care for the ED.<br />
<br />
For characters I&#039;m just gonna talk about satoko and some of her victims briefly. Satoko is just annoying, like... I get it... she&#039;s evil... you dont have to spend half this season explaining every detail of what she did... just show us the oishii one and we get it. The victims of the curse I feel were to quick to be paranoid, like it would be a much better idea, if it went more in depth on there descent into madness rather than just satoko poppin them and going crazy pretty much instantly.<br />
<br />
The reason I keep watching is mostly because of morbid fascination with how they&#039;ll rope the other ryukishi series into this and how it will drive sales from crackpot newtypes who still think this story is deep rather than just being &quot;dang, these kids are psychos&quot;

    Higurashi Sotsu is a miserable experience. It&#039;s a huge troll of an anime in the worst of ways. It respects neither the intelligence nor the time of its viewers. The first 13 episodes of this 15 episode series are glorified recaps. Recaps which add little to no new relevant plot information that couldn&#039;t be assumed by having watched the end of Higurashi Gou.<br />
<br />
To those unfortunate enough to want to know then end of the story after watching Gou, it&#039;s best to just skip to episode 14 of Sotsu.<br />
<br />
This show is has the genre labels horror and mystery, but the only horror to be found is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419139">
        in the viewer&#039;s slow realization that the massive amounts of time spent watching Gou and Sotsu were entirely pointless, and the biggest mystery is how anyone could ever enjoy this.

    The beginning concept of Higurashi isn’t that original — a boy moves to isolated, rural town and slowly discovers things are not what they seem. But it’s a “classic” story setting for a mystery anime, as opposed to one that’s “overused.” Higurashi is also impressive when you consider how it blends perfectly a bunch of genres that don’t usually go together. It’s a harem/ horror/ mystery/ drama/ comedy/ psychological anime that even has some slice-of-life. The detail and originality of the Higurashi story is splendid, with puzzling mysteries, exploration of the “curse,” and the way the world resets with each arc. I’d say more, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410462">
        I’m avoiding spoilers.<br />
<br />
Now let’s take a look at the content and how it’s presented in Higurashi. I don’t know of any other anime that does such a good job of combining stories of lighthearted fun and comedy with stories of disturbing violence and suspense. When things are peaceful, I feel like I’m right there with the characters having fun with them. The cute, funny, and weird quirks, reactions, and interactions are highly entertaining. The humor will at least bring a smile to your face. Higurashi‘s presentation of suspense and creepiness is right on-point. The violence is just as horrifying as it should be (and believe me, it’s not over-the-top compared to some of the graphically violent anime out there.) Also, the show knows how to deliver good, interesting drama.In Higurashi‘s first season, thought-provoking themes and motifs are not immediately obvious because of all the gore and insanity. Some are there, though, and they’re fairly powerful. (Still, the second season does better with incorporating meaningful messages and themes.) These include friendship and faith in friends, betrayal, atonement, misunderstandings, cause and effect, young love, obsession, character psychology, and determination.It would be a great understatement to say the seiyuu cast is great; they are basically perfect in this show. I’ll mention some here. Soichiro Hoshi voices male lead Keiichi, and I’m surprised he doesn’t have more roles since his acting was all-around on-point. He played the MC of Gundam Seed, and I know him best as Gino from Code Geass. Satsuki Yunkino plays Mion and Shion Sonozaki; she is probably best known for voicing Kagome in InuYasha and Otae in Gintama. The range of Yukino’s voice from sweet to scary is impressive, as is the volume and power she can put into shouts and laughs. She’s a veteran voice-actress who really gets into her characters.<br />
<br />
Rena Ryuuguu’s seiyuu is Mai Nakahara, another bright talent, and exceptionally great with playing characters that have a menacing side. She’s been in many anime I haven’t seen, but I know her Luvia in Fairy Tale, Nagisa in Clannad, Watashi in Humanity Has Declined, Mai in Mai-Hime, Yukinoshita’s older sis from Oregairu, and Nanami Yasuri in Katanagatari. The seiyuu of Rika Furude is Yukari Tamura, whose voice is usually adorable and high, but has a great range of pitch/ tone etc. She’s most famous for voicing Suzuha in Steins;Gate and Nanoha in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. Other fantastic VAs include Yuu Kobayashi (as Satoshi), Miki Itou (as Miyo Takano), and Hirotaka Shimazawa (as Detective Ooishi).In my opinion, the characters in Higurashi deserve another full 10/10, but many other people consider them difficult to relate to because of the insanity most of them suffer at one point or another. As well, it’s difficult to gather a detailed picture of the characters’ personalities from just one watch of the series; to understand them and love them as much as I do requires re-watching many times and analyzing many behaviors and lines spoken. Because of these potential difficulties, I gave the characters category a 9/10 rather than 10/10.<br />
<br />
Other than anything mentioned above, the characters in Higurashi are presented and expanded on perfectly. The development and growth of characters is well-paced, spread throughout the episodes. It’s great how you learn a little more about each of the characters in each arc. There is adequate character growth/ maturation within the arcs, but of course, it doesn’t really carry over to the next world. Even if you can’t relate to them too well, I believe you’ll find that Mion, Shion, Satoko, Rika, Keiichi, and all the others are engaging and entertaining characters.<br />
<br />
It’s getting very difficult to resist writing tons of text about the characters I love, why I love them, and their stories. Anything like that would include spoilers. So I must stop myself nowOh, this isn’t fair. I want to give you examples of so many things I love. Things like favorite character, favorite arc, a quote I like, an enjoyable funny moment or joke, a sad moment that spoke to me, or my favorite scenes of characters going crazy. But almost all of that involves spoilers. Well, maybe not. Let’s see. My favorite character is Shion Sonozaki, and second-favorite is Rika Furude. My favorite arc in season one is “Meakashi-hen,” or “Eye-Opening Chapter.” It runs from episode 16 to 21. Something funny I love is Satoko’s villainous ojou-sama laugh. It’s perfect.<br />
<br />
The sad, powerful, and crazy moments I want to talk about all give spoilers, though. I did have a quote in mind, but it won’t make any sense to you unless I explain the situation (would mean giving spoilers) or unless you’ve already seen the show/scene. Well, I’ll leave it here anyway. I like this quote because reveals a lot abut Shion’s personality and motivations.

    I tend not to write reviews, and yet here I am again writing a review for the second season of the Higurashi reboot. I don&#039;t even know where to begin anymore. At first I was just frustrated at many components of Gou and Sotsu, but now I&#039;m just utterly defeated. I haven&#039;t even seen the final episode yet as of this review, but seeing as how completely and thoroughly Sotsu has destroyed the legacy of Higurashi, I don&#039;t feel like waiting another week only to voice the same opinions. Before this review turns into an incoherent rant, let me attempt to try and bring some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418169">
        order to my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Im only gonna cover the characters and mix in criticisms of parts of the story, otherwise there will just be far too much to say. The only conclusion I have is that Higurashi Sotsu is an excellent character assassination of figures from both Higurashi and Umineko, almost as if it was intentional. I&#039;ll try to briefly cover the biggest offenses below:<br />
<br />
Featherine (or Eua or whatever her name was in the anime) is The Witch of Theatergoing, Drama and Spectating. Out of the countless stories she has witnessed and manipulated, for whatever reason she acts like Satoko&#039;s little cat and mouse game is some sort of high art and among the best of them all, which really shatters her image as a refined and cultured being who has seen all of history yet still looks for new entertainment. To add to the destruction of her image, she laughs patronizingly nearly every time she is on screen, in a way she would likely chide her servants for doing. The writers use her to explain the concepts that might be a little too complex to the viewer instead of letting the not so subtle themes be shown rather than told to the viewer, and in doing so they dumb her down as well. <br />
<br />
Anyway, next is Satoko. Satoko...Yeah. 13 of the 15 episodes of this season are essentially recap episodes of the Gou season before it ever actually returns to the cliffhanger they left off with. The only difference is that they are instead told from Satoko&#039;s perspective, except instead of teaching the viewer anything, it is overexplaining a plot element that was never strong enough to carry the show. Satoko&#039;s role in all the new crimes is not news to the viewer by this season. So instead of revealing any new information like the typical Answer arc of an 07th work would do, Sotsu shows us the completely unsympathetic efforts of Satoko as she crafts plans and carries out cruel torture of her closest friends, all because, and I&#039;m quoting Satoko herself here, &quot;I hate studying&quot;. If you got to this season you know the whole Saint Lucia&#039;s ordeal, but yeah, she is willing to destroy the lives of her friends and does so sadistically because Satoko is now the cute little fanservice loli yandere workhorse that is supposed to justify this anime existing and carry the plot. <br />
<br />
The last character I&#039;ll bother discussing is Rika. Perhaps this criticism is too harsh, but given that she is someone who has hundreds of years of life experience and sagely wisdom, and has solved countless crimes in Hinamizawa (although she rarely lived through them), it takes her two seasons to figure out who the killer is, and even then its not through her own deduction but because of a poorly written plot convenience. This is part of the biggest problem I would say this season had; the complete lack of any payoff.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s absolutely no sense of triumph or excitement when Rika reaches the truth, as there is when the protagonist of any mystery work finally solves the mystery. Nothing new happens until the 14th episode of the season, and there&#039;s only 15 in total. But rather than redeeming any of the problems or issues, episode 14 is the murder weapon that finally kills the Higurashi franchise. Even among the people who have been enjoying this season, I have been hearing wtfs and comments about dissatisfaction. It doesn&#039;t even feel like Higurashi anymore. Without spoiling anything, all the tropes of a shounen anime are thrown in, and a dragon ball style battle ensues spanning multiple quickly cut fragments with tons of determined anime screaming, unnecessary loli gore porn,  flying through the sky and battling with nonsensical energy auras... I don&#039;t even know what to say. The final fight makes no sense anyway, as the anime has previously said that if Satoko dies before Rika it basically nullifies her power, but now they act as if the only way to kill a looper is with the specific weapon Rika was told about. The anime is clearly aware of both of these statements, as Satoko is always careful to die after Rika, and both of them battle over control over the weapon, but it somehow overlooks the fact that Rika doesn&#039;t even need the weapon to kill Satoko, not to mention the fact that Satoko doesnt want to kill Rika permanently but still tries to kill her with the looper killing weapon anyway.<br />
<br />
Sotsu has done everything wrong, both as a Higurashi successor and as a story in general. It feels the need to show every single detail of Satoko&#039;s plots, rather than trust the audience to understand that she is masterminding the plots. The motivation of the main antagonist, who is the main focus of the season, is not only remarkably shallow, but completely unsympathetic and really takes you out of the story, as it is in no way believable. The constant debriefing sessions Satoko has with Featherine are also just another way of padding runtime, recycling plots, and giving exposition or explaining how characters are feeling instead of actually having any feeling at all. <br />
<br />
Higurashi Sotsu is not horror, its not mystery, its not suspenseful. It isn&#039;t really Higurashi at all, and if you watch this season I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll agree by the end too. But even if you stop comparing Sotsu to the original Higurashi, you&#039;re left with nothing really. The show takes too many leniencies with explanations that can only come from the original to be considered a standalone. But if we ignore this and consider only the substance in front of us, the story Sotsu tries to tell is still just a long, drawn out attempt to make a lackluster story and unremarkable writing into something that resembles a coherent one, and sacrifices everything that could otherwise make it enjoyable along the way. <br />
<br />
Why have you done this to us Ryukishi?<br />

    (Spoilers about the previous season ahead)<br />
<br />
It pains me to say that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu is an absolute shitfest. This comes from a anime enthusiast that has held the first two seasons, released in 2006 and 2007, as their favorite anime of all time.<br />
<br />
If in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou, Satoko character development and motifs have been butchered when compared with the first two seasons, in terms of &quot;gore&quot;, in the first episodes, it could be somewhat compared to the first season: Various stories independent from each other, that end up on someone going mad.<br />
<br />
Now, what brings Higurashi no Naku Koro ni

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418157">
        Sotsu to be so bad? Well, even though it was entertaining in terms of &quot;slashing&quot; the story is significant worse when compared with the somewhat similar 2nd season, regarding the first episodes. However, the story only catches up to the plot twist stablished on the previous season in the last 2 episodes...and oh boy it is nonsensical. <br />
<br />
Without going into major spoilers, the anime turns into Dragon Ball-esque fights, with people flying around and jumping through time without any explanation behind of how this is happening...it completely disregards the nonsensical laws of the world that have been stablished in Gou and Sotsu.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, should you watch Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu? Has a fan of Higurashi, absolutely not. As someone who just wants to watch a slasher and make fun of an anime that has an awful story, reaching the likes of &quot;Ousama Game The Animation&quot;, absolutely yes

    Updated Review:<br />
Well, the story is over… I won&#039;t update the score of Sotsu because one episode doesn&#039;t make one entire season, the flaws remain there. The ending I&#039;m just neutral about, it didn&#039;t make me hate it but it didn&#039;t blow me away whatsoever. I certainly rather think that the ending of the original series is the real ending, without all the clingy Satoko nonsense. The plot twists were good but then it just became too stupid for my taste. That&#039;s just how it is.<br />
<br />
Original Review:<br />
I&#039;m sorry but I&#039;m not even gonna wait until Sotsu is over to complain about this already. I might change

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416909">
        my rating later on the show depending on the ending, but I can already tell you I&#039;m not giving it more than a 5 with the way they are treating viewers as if we have amnesia or something, literally giving us a recap EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of things we already know or have seen. We don&#039;t forget these moments, we pay attention to a story where you have to pay attention to details, and if someone forgets, they can rewatch episodes, we don&#039;t need the show to give us endless recaps over and over again. Whoever did Gou and Sotsu have to be different people, at least on the matter of pacing. I understand wanting to milk Higurashi, but this is beyond milking, this is STALLING the plot. Literally only like 5 minutes per episode matter only anymore, the rest is just recap of scenes you already saw, as if they are treating the viewers asif they suffer of amnesia or something.<br />
<br />
Notice how I repeated myself in this review? that&#039;s how it feels to be currently watching Sotsu. MY GOD. lol<br />
<br />
I love Higurashi, but I swear, just like Naruto has a list of filler episodes so people can skip, I BET that fans will edit these Sotsu episodes with only the portions of scenes that are new, and the season will be probably half as long, just with the stuff that matters if you have been paying attention to the story. If no one thought about doing that, then here you go, now that idea has to be done with Sotsu as soon as it&#039;s over, so rewatching the show (or people waiting for the show to be over before binge watching it) isn&#039;t a pain in the literal arse.<br />

This is possibly the greatest anime ever made. I&#039;m a long time fan of Higurashi since 2006 so my expectations for this story are extremely high. Yet somehow this show not only delivered but surpassed all my realistic expectations and just blew me away. Never before has an anime story had such great buildup and payoff in the end.<br />
<br />
I was excited getting into Gou with it going down a neat new story direction and expanding upon the Higurashi universe further. Sotsu is a continuation of the saga that Gou set up and revisits a lot of the murders from the previous season from a fresh

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419174">
        new perspective. Even though we have seen these events in some form from the previous season, Sotsu puts fresh new twists and shocking reveals so there is never once a dull moment. And it all feels so gloriously rewarding with the payoff we get in the climax. As a fan over the whole scope of Ryukishi07&#039;s works and not just in isolation to Higurashi, this work is near masterful..<br />
<br />
My only complaint about this anime is that the art an animation are just average and don&#039;t do anything that amazing. Still, when the only complaint about the art and animation is that it is standard, I&#039;m really trying to reach when coming up with aspects this anime actually did wrong.<br />
<br />
The sound and characters are all up to WTC&#039;s traditionally high standards for such. The OP and ED were amazing performances and always got me hyped for the show. The music used during the final conflict was chilling and gave me goosebumps.<br />
<br />
Overall this anime is a rare masterpiece. It has far exceeded all my expectations. 10/10 will watch again.

    After the massive cliffhanger that Higurashi Gou left off on, fans were incredibly anxious to get things resolved in Sotsu. Sadly, Sotsu took 3 months to wrap up something that should have been an extra 4 episodes at most. <br />
<br />
While I did really like a lot of Sotsu like Satoko’s perspective, so much of it could have been condensed. 70 percent of the content we got during this season was just rehashed from Gou. If you can suffer through the reused footage, Higu Sotsu has some of the best moments of the entire series in my opinion. Episodes 12 and 15 are probably my two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419022">
        favourite episodes of the entire franchise. Watching Satoko’s gradual descent into darkness and the lengths she’s willing to go to in order to break Rika’s spirit was simultaneously horrifying, yet amazing. I enjoyed seeing Eua and the divine aspects of the Higu series front and centre for once as well. The first few seasons focus heavily on the humans and the virus portion of the lore, but Sotsu gives a lot of time to the mystical and magical elements of Higurashi lore.<br />
<br />
I think Sotsu has everything that makes Higurashi great. Mystery, dread, pain, magic, murderous lolis, etc., but it just feels inconsistent. There’s episodes that have mainly new content(last 3) and are a blast to watch, and then there’s ones that feel like a chore to sit through because I’ve already seen everything. Then there&#039;s episodes like the finale which kind of feel like a slap in the face to OG Higu fans because of the majority of time and money going to a loli fist fight and other plot conveniences. The final episode feels like it just came out of nowhere and left myself and others disappointed.<br />
<br />
 I honestly struggle to understand why they made a full 15 episode season of this instead of just making Gou longer and or just doing what MagiReco season 2 did and making a really short second season. The only explanation I can come up with is BD sales, for which higher episode counts equate to more volumes and profits. It looks like the production committee were having just as hard a time as the fans with saying goodbye to the beloved horror series. Sadly, they didn&#039;t leave it on the best note.<br />
<br />
Because of the repetitiveness of everything, it’s really hard for me to rate Higu Sotsu. On one hand, I did really enjoy watching it and when we got new content it was on par with or better than anything we’d seen before, the DBZ style fight with Satoko and Rika in episode 15 will forever be immortalised. It just happened far too little and far too late in the 15 episodes for me to really rate Sotsu as high as I’d like to. For better or worse, the show does feel like a final conclusion to Higurashi and if you&#039;re a fan of the series you should watch it. I could see other Higurashi else-world stories being created later on whether in anime or VN form, but I’d like to think this concludes Rika, Keichi, Shion and crew’s long journey. <br />
<br />
Higurashi Sotsu gets 7 out of 10.

    There were two things that made the original Higurashi so good: Mystery and Despair. The constant confusion and anxiety formed by each loop were strangely delightful to experience and it constantly kept you engaged, wondering how is this connected to this, why is this happening, etc. The second part is the despair, the violence, the suffering, the dark stuff some of us enjoy a lot. It wasn&#039;t only the gruesome gore and deaths themselves, some of the events that aren&#039;t bloody are terrifying as well, like one of the arcs where satoko is the last one alive in Hinamizawa after the &quot;gas&quot; eruption, who is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418665">
        forced to deal with that reality right after watching a murderous Keichi fall to his death. It&#039;s so horrifying and it&#039;s so good. Yet Higurashi isn&#039;t just a gorefest or a sadist&#039;s generic entertainment, because throughout it&#039;s entire runtime you are under the impression that these horrible things are happening for a reason and the mystery of it all gives the story its substance.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s look at the new Higurashi, I think it&#039;s fair to judge both Gou and Sotsu together since they&#039;re like two parts of the same story. As much as my score doesn&#039;t imply the following: I found Gou to be entertaining enough. Granted it wasn&#039;t as good as the original but the same sense of mystery and despair was there, and I didn&#039;t mind the big twist at the end and Rika&#039;s and Satoko&#039;s story in the academy. Yet unlike the original Higurashi, the more episodes that passed the harder and harder it was to go along with the nonsensical clusterfuck this show had become.<br />
<br />
Granted, the original Higurashi also had some hard to believe elements like the virus, Rika being a carrier, demons from the past, the looping mechanic itself and the sea of fragments. Yet all of these are tastefully implemented in the story and they just barely manage to pass your bullshit radar. Gou is fine as well but shit gets too nonsensical with Sotsu. <br />
<br />
Suddenly there&#039;s another deity, both deities have powers which are unexplained, Satoko has special looping abilities, there is a looper killing swords, satoko fights herself in the sea of fragments and kills herself, you have no idea if this is metaphorical to her killing her old personality or literally she killed another version of herself. The grand finale of episode 14 which made me drop the show has satoko and Rika going Goku and flying around, fighting each other.<br />
<br />
What made Higurashi so horrifying was that mostly everything that happened made sense, there were substantive reasons for the horrific things the characters are going through. Yet the main reason in Gou and Sotsu is that there&#039;s a new deity and she&#039;s bored so she just makes Satoko torture Rika. Not only does this make everything seem pointless and arbitrary, it&#039;s also boring because the mystery is gone. Right from the moment Satoko pulls out her gun on Rika the mystery pretty much dies down. Sotsu is just a recap that we didn&#039;t need that barely adds anything to the story. We just sit and watch everything we already know happened play out, it&#039;s boring and a lazy way to fill runtime. Yet we sit through it because we want to know how it&#039;s gonna play out, what will Rika do when she figures it out, and well she just goes DBZ super power mode and fights Satoko like I&#039;m watching a parody of Higurashi.<br />
<br />
The suffering is pointless, the recap is pointless, this new Higurashi is pointless and it taints the original story so much that it&#039;s insulting. Whether you&#039;re a new or an old fan, stay away from this one.
