    If ‘No Guns Life’ (NGL) were an American cartoon, they could have called it, ‘Second Amendments Life.’  Imagine the liberals attempting to ban guns, and then Juzo filibustering their candy assess because that would infringe upon his right to life.  Then, after winning the case, he could slap Ted Cruz in the face, and claim he has really bad aim with his high-fives.<br />

NGL is a dynamic anime where the main character, Juzo Inui, kills various villains on his quest toward determining who turned him into an ‘extended’ (cyborg designed for war).  The dark, murky atmosphere is a nice lure to pull in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321112">
        the viewer; however, when Juzo begins to act silly (i.e. the embarrassed faces he makes when he sees a half-naked girl), it becomes irksome.  Juzo’s characterization, thus far, is rather superficial, and if it weren’t for his gun prosthetic, it would be difficult to distinguish him from other action-centric heroes.  He’s the classic ‘badass hero’ who is designed to look cool, and defeat numerous baddies.<br />
<br />
NGL also draws a clear line of demarcation between the good-guys and the members of the evil corporation (Berühren Corporation).  Making the story a black-and-white affair, that will, most likely follow a predictable build up to the final ‘boss fight.’  The visuals are respectable — given that it’s Madhouse — nevertheless, there is nothing stunning or memorable.  The OST, along with the anime itself, is uninspired, and easily forgettable.  <br />
<br />
All in all: NGL features humdrum action, insipid characters, and weird tonal shifts that are anything but funny.  If you were looking for a show that captured the same excitement as ‘Black Lagoon,’ then keep searching, because it ain’t NGL.

    No Guns Life shines brighter than most of its surrounding competition thanks to its central themes of corruption and dehumanization, strengthened by it’s gritty noir style. But the execution casts a strong shadow on the whole show, loaded with mediocrity.<br />
<br />
It has a good foundation to improve from though. Most of the 1st season is used for world-building and does it modestly well. But it often felt like it went all over the place and never really resolved many of the plot threads that it had built up. The characters especially took a bullet due to this. Most of them were blander than stale bread because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324947">
        of how their development is severely lacking as of now.<br />
<br />
Our main protagonist Inui Juuzou is an Over-Extended and former gun slave unit that was used during a war. His backstory from that time is only mentioned briefly, teasing you to keep watching and find out more later. Other characters fall into this as well which made it rather frustrating since besides their backstories they have almost nothing going for them. They are at least not laughably generic like many of the villains are, who are extremely in your face about how evil and insane they can be. Some of them are supposed to be on a constant hunt for a person that Juuzou is protecting but that&#039;s just forgotten about multiple times.<br />
<br />
On a more positive note, the aesthetic of the bleak and gritty dystopian future the show takes place in is refreshing. It’s an noir inspired setting that I rarely see these days and something I would gladly see more of. Aesthetic aside the visuals are alright for the most part. There&#039;s a heavy use of CGI but it blends in with it&#039;s 2-D counterpart enough to not become too distracting. Character movement was solid most of the time and they were very consistently on model throughout. The action scenes were the visual highlight and were pretty fast-paced and enjoyable. The CGI is also implemented well here and at times used to the show&#039;s advantage. <br />
<br />
The noir style was amplified thanks to the smooth jazz soundtrack that really helped give the show it’s own identity. I can&#039;t say it did a lot for me emotionally, but was overall pretty decent for what it was. I feel pretty much the same way about the voice acting which was also decent and fitting to the characters personality. Not any outstanding performances but they did their job well and made the characters feel more real, aside from some of the villains that just sounded ridiculous.<br />
<br />
But overall I can&#039;t say I&#039;m satisfied at all when the characters and story haven&#039;t been properly fleshed out. I think the most harmful problem was the lack of story and character progression which makes it hard to recommend. If it’s style is not enough to make up for it then I can see many finding this boring. However I think it’s worth the shot because it does have some things to appreciate. If you don’t find it compelling early on then you probably won’t like the rest either. <br />

    No guns life does three things right that really draw you in. Those three things being.<br />
<br />
An interesting world that makes you want to see more of what it is, what it holds, and what other characters roam such a world. As you can see with the description. I&#039;m quite interested to see what other extends there are. As it&#039;s quite amazing how different each one is looking and the abilities they have.<br />
<br />
The main characters personalities and who they are in general are great too. Who would&#039;ve thought a guy with a gun for a head would have such an interesting background haha. But I find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321095">
        myself rooting for him as the story goes on.<br />
<br />
An interesting set of characters that also add to it&#039;s interesting story. As I just stated, you&#039;ll make yourself wonder what else is in this world. Which adds to the final point, in that the story is rather great in itself. But even with a few episodes watched, it feels like there is still a whole lot to tell. It&#039;s really fascinating. <br />
<br />
A must watch for this season of anime. If you like mystery, cyberpunk, and action. Then you&#039;ll surely love this. I know I do.

    Walking down the dark metropolis is a man with a gun head. A man without conviction. A man filled with righteous. A man with unrivaled pride in his work. From the cyberpunk world where cyborgs exists, this man is a private detective and resolves to rid of it of corruption. He is Juzo Inui, a gun head who is here to help the helpless.<br />
<br />
Mangaka Tasku Karasuma is not fairly well known to most audiences although some of his work incorporates the usage of futuristic worlds and science fiction. No Guns Life is no exception as we are introduced to a cyberpunk setting. Humans are now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324823">
        cyborgs and are called “Extended”. Crime is rampant and on the loose in the city. With such technology, you can just imagine how chaotic society has become. Juzo is an Extended problem solver who relies on his mental and physical skills to deal with other Extended. From the very beginning, the audience should pay full attention to Juzo’s character behavior. Despite being an Extended, he has the personality of a private detective and always seeks to complete his tasks for the right price. With the motto of “wipe your own ass”, Juzo prefers to work alone and isn’t afraid to take big risks. From a personal perspective, Juzo is not just the poster boy of No Guns Life but also a symbol. He is a symbol for people to take their own responsibility for their actions. <br />
<br />
Now I won’t deny No Guns Life is somewhat of a niche anime. Even as a paranormal detective show, the anime leans more into sci-fi and action. The story flows with each episode introducing ongoing problems in a city and corruption. We also meet characters who Juzo associates with including Mary Steinberg and Tetsuro Arahbaki. These two collaborates together with Juzo although they also have their own personal goals. (for instance, Mary hopes to reunite with her brother) Nonetheless, Juzo acts as more of an anti-hero throughout the series. Even though he performs heroic deeds, he’s also a mercenary who takes cases for money. For the right price, Juzo does his job regardless how difficult it may be. But on some occasions, he also helps the Extended in need with his own conviction. In essence, he helps the helpless and comes across as a fairly reasonable man. Some associates occasionally assists him in his tasks although the main course of his job is undertaken by the gunhead himself. Speaking of which, how likeable are the other characters? The bottom line is that Juzo overshadows them but they do possesses unique roles in the show. Mary works as a mechanic and is important to his well-being. Tetsuro has an ability to control other Extended’s bodies making an invaluable asset. Even Olivier Vandeberme, a law enforcer, provides freedom for Juzo so he can work without disturbance. The fact is, these characters are important to the core of the show and without them, Juzo would have a harder time to achieve his goals.<br />
<br />
But an important question remains. What is your goal for watching No Guns Life? What are you hoping to get out of this science fiction story taking place in this deluded cyberpunk world? It’s ambiguous question because No Guns Life is an unconventional show with its own identity. Sometimes, you have to wonder what the author wanted you to experience. Juzo, the gun head reminds us how the potentials of Extended and their limitations. I mean, isn’t it funny how he can’t actually fire the augmented gun on his head without assistance? In fact, many Extended in the series carries some sort of burden in the aftermath of the great war. A major social issue relating to poverty also exists as some Extended resorts of violence to survive. On the other hand, we have mega corporations such as Behruen, standing as a symbol of power and bureaucracy. It reminds of the old classic 1987 Robocop where futuristic technological inventions are treated differently than others. Crime remains a major issue in the story as Juzo deals with corruption. He finds out the hard way after facing off against rogue cyborg Gondry, the very first Extended. Standing out as a powerful individual but also victimized by the result of the war, Gondry is a poster boy of experimentation. An arc dealing with him is one of the climatic clashes exploring the ethnics of technology. And to be honest, I think it’s one of the highlights in this season. Meanwhile, No Guns Life also gains support for eliciting emotional appeal to the audience. Characters such as Olivier has their own motivations and in one of the later episodes, we find out her purpose in the story. If you made it this far, then I can say it’s safe that you’ll be staying the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
Serving as a celebration of Madhouse’s creative works, No Guns Life has distinctive elements in its artwork. The dark and noir-style backgrounds inspire a cyberpunk look for the main setting.  Most noticeably, the backgrounds are animated with the Unreal Engine to make them as polished as they can be. By rendering the visuals and fuse them with the character models, it makes both parts stand out sharply. It’s not too often we get to see a game engine being used for an animated series so perhaps this opens doors more to future projects of similar nature. The Extended are also decorative with unique augmentations and modifications to the body, so much that you’ll see them more than regular humans. Characters that stand out the most includes Juzo, Gondry, and perhaps Olivier. Their character expressions sell a variety of human behavior ranging from comical, emotional, and diabolical. And if you’re in for some light comedy, there’s that too. Character interactions sometimes goofs around with their cartoony expressions. Then, there are also light jokes thrown around that pokes fun at technological themes with dry humor. We can’t also ignore how often Juzo needs help to fire his own gun, can we? <br />
<br />
No Guns Life is a unique piece of work with its own identity. As someone who has read the manga, it’s easy to get used to even if you’re not familiar with its ideas. The more I watched No Guns Life, the easier it became to understand what the author wanted to show us. Trust me, go watch No Guns Life and experience a hallmark of unorthodox beauty.

    I don&#039;t really get it why uninnovative cyberdunk dystopian stories always get the flak of it being unimaginative and impromptu of its massive storytelling coupled with world-building, but I&#039;d can say that while No Guns Life is one of the more uninspired stories out there in a sea of mech stories both old and new, it&#039;s slow-burn and the entire plot universe around it is what keeps me glued to this show of infinite proportions of its many directions it could head towards, and it&#039;s sad that not as many people are as intrigued to the settings and such, and heck, this show still has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324825">
        a 2nd cour (or more appropriately the 2nd half) to go!<br />
<br />
Always been wondering about the editorial remarks on No Guns Life&#039;s cover? It says here: “SF hard boiled the gun smoke drifts muzzle talks” (just like that, without commas). To quote someone who knows the source well, it’s surprisingly accurate: Protagonist &quot;Resolver&quot; Inui Juzou, is a rogue private detective part of the &quot;Gun Slave Unit&quot; assigned to eradicate Extendeds, who&#039;s always smoking cigarettes, is smoking hot, smokes with gun smoke, because he is an (Over-Extended) cyborg made of revolvers, his head for a gun (revolver), and being the the spirit of the noire revolver embodied: bitter, badass, with a dark history, seeking to break away from the hands that try to subdue him, actually a weapon. And due in part of Juzou being half-human and half-weapon/tool, he always tries not to force a bad hand in situations that call for it in the best possible way he could, and his motto is to &quot;wipe your own ass&quot; i.e. clear your own shit the way you know how.<br />
<br />
And in this post-apocalyptic world, the seemingly formed relationships are barely legal depending on which side of the case it leans on: the &quot;righteous&quot; side of Juzou and his workhorse people, or the retro-futuristic cyberpunk setting, which in turn is also a proper one – with an evil cybernetic corporation, a brutal police force tasked with keeping the modified Extendeds in check, with questions of transhumanism and alienation, along with the punk part – bodies being spliced and spruced up in backdoor-alleyway undercity clinics, body horror and brain hacking. So the world in No Guns Life literally has not both start and end lines, but rather, everything is a process in and of its end onto itself. To sweeten the deal, the anime&#039;s background of a war does best to interlink both sides, where due to the war happened before the world ever came into a consensus, humans and mech Extendeds are like owners and tools before all rules and regulation broke down.<br />
<br />
In essence, it&#039;s the interesting characters that both make or break the series in accordance with the many issues at hand, and here&#039;s where Juzou&#039;s life gets more exacerbated from Tetsuro Arahabaki, the son of the CEO of the evil Berühren Corporation, who is heavily wanted for experimentation for a device that is heavily implanted within him that could control and take over Extendeds in range to amass their reach beyond areas of influence. Add in Tetsuro&#039;s annoying and bratty behaviour, along with company associate-cum-mechanic Mary Steinburg and the EMS agency which regulates Extended and Over-Extended beings like Juzou and keeping them under check that they don&#039;t flout the law, all this becomes one massive problem that Juzou just couldn&#039;t afford to shrug under the rug.<br />
<br />
To commend this show on the storytelling and the over-arching plot, it is pretty much a perfect 100% 1-to-1 adaptation of the manga into the anime, which says a lot about fans not wanting to lose out on anything even remotely minor, and No Guns Life definitely benefitted from series composer Yukie Sugawara taking no liberties and adapting the manga&#039;s entirety to good use. And sure, the story will not win any awards with some of its cheeziness, but for pretty much creating hidden crannies and hooks that&#039;ll intrigue us to dive even deeper, I&#039;d say that it has done its job well. Not great mind you, but not bad for a valiant effort.<br />
<br />
And who to bring that classic 90&#039;s stylized feels and visuals other than Madhouse, I truly love it when such works like this call back the old aesthetics that give seasoned studios to stretch on their legs for visuals that have been long gone in time past. The modern world, made old with the entire cyberpunk. scrapyard setting really gives it a feel for some of the older classics that we&#039;ve come to know and love (i.e. Trigun, made by the same studio). Coupled with the great animation, I&#039;d say that Madhouse has done a good job in replicating the entire world to its core. Factor in the great music with the background music and especially the OST, which was a complete surprise that the entire ED is done in Unreal Engine 4 by Cyclone Graphics to aid that gamer-futuristic look. That&#039;s superb and unheard of by any standards, with the cool jazzy OP and ED that made up the experience overall.<br />
<br />
This show&#039;s truly boring you say, and I&#039;d agree to an extent, but take a deep dive under the rabbit hole and you&#039;ll see that No Guns Life truly is a fascinating show with as many of its layers waiting to be delved into a story that is initially hard to pick up but even harder to drop.  Can&#039;t wait for the 2nd half to drop in Spring 2020, and if you need a binge, do pick this up before the 2nd half commences if your interest hasn&#039;t waned yet.

    No Guns Life? Yes, no guns should ever be brought to life.<br />
<br />
Spoiler warning but I&#039;ll just give you one small one, it&#039;s not good. Don&#039;t bother watching this series because it is downright awful. I know for a fact that at face value this show seems &#039;cool&#039; and &#039;radical&#039; with the main character having a head of a revolver and the world taking place in the future. I know this because that was my initial thoughts when going into this show, honestly, the show was fine until everything changed when that Tetsurou annoyance entered the scene. Right away that kid alone just place this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325299">
        in the negative zone, he is literally the embodiment of kid Naruto and that&#039;s not a nice thing to see. This is literally his format for his character for scenarios, Juno is busy with an issue, the boy&#039;s a busybody and has to &#039;help&#039;, in turn of &#039;helping&#039; Juno he fucks up and gets beaten up, Juno saves him and the boy just apologies, then the cycle continues. This is utter trash writing from the people behind this series, even if is a copy from the books, they do not even try to make scenes or plot interesting.<br />
<br />
 I am going to be straight, the reasons why I didn&#039;t give this series a 1 because I love the concept and I like Mary and Juno, that&#039;s all. The music sucks, the art sucks (especially coming from you Madhouse), plot uninteresting and unfocused, just the show is a complete mess. Like if they just focus the whole plot on Mary and Juno alone, I bet it would come for a much enjoyable series, &#039;Mary and Juno&#039;s Bizarre Adventures&#039;. That I would dig. It is so obvious the studio is placing this series out for the sake of filling the anime seasons slots, I know for a fact that Madhouse is not using the full production team due to them also working on Chihayafuru 3. Either this shows the saturation of anime titles the NHK demands to studios or that Madhouse just got lazy and they decided to just shit out series without any dazzle on them. This doesn&#039;t come off super disappointing as I can clearly see the show&#039;s flaws at the near beginning, so it really shouldn&#039;t come as a surprise to anyone that this series is bad. I do want to call out the ambitious aim the show was trying to go for, like the issue with robots living aside humans and the struggle to maintain peace after a long war. However I just think the studio didn&#039;t actually understand the sheer size of what they were aiming, there were tons of technological gaps in the show, not very innovative ideas despite the place being in the future, social system is like messy and politics are just obsolete. I am going to stop here, but if you watch it through yourself you would be able to intake this pile of under-produced crap.<br />
<br />
-SCORES-<br />
<br />
Characters- 4/10: Fuck the kid and almost everyone else, Juno and Mary are the only acceptable ones.<br />
<br />
Art- 3/10: Boobies are big but the physics is so bad that every oppai seems dead to me. In majority of the scenes, especially when the characters turn or look somewhere else, it looks as if the turning animation was made on Windows XP. Face are fucked, environment&#039;s boring and the whole show is just trying to mimic shit. Only thing to praise them for is the use of Unreal Engine 4. It&#039;s true though, some of the visuals are pretty &#039;unreal&#039; to believe in.<br />
<br />
Writing- 2/10: Ooooweee did this part had a blast, since there is so much bad shit to ramble about I&#039;ll just say one good thing. Which is errrrrrrrr... Nevermind I can&#039;t think of anything. The show is bad at choosing whether this scene should be serious or that scene should be funny and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Sound- 5/10: For the most part is fine, everything does it&#039;s job but not super well nor super bad. Everything is alright except the god awful outro, like seriously what is with that outro. It feels as if the singers just muttering a script with the beat off some Eurovision song.<br />
<br />
Overall, trash. Plus there is a second season coming up, what a joke. I guess the only way Madhouse and the writers can prove themselves is by delivering their utmost best in the next one. But to comeback from a ditch as deep as this would take a miracle. <br />
<br />

    No Guns Life is a cyberpunk/noir set in a post-war world where soldiers underwent cybernetic enhancements reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell. The MC is a huge, morally gray, dark and broody guy with a giant revolver for a freaking head. The show has a noir aesthetic resulting in a dark, dim, and gloomy color palette that perfectly matches the theme of dark-underbelly-of-a-rotting-city reminiscent of Watchmen. The main antagonist is this embodiment of the military industrial complex that uses people as tools and discards them when no longer useful, sort of like Google with Guns with the motto: Be evil.<br />
<br />
Though the prevailing theme of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321087">
        show is noir, there are times of tonal dissonance when our hard-boiled MC turns blushing bumbling chibi when embarrassed. It feels like the show’s cheating by utilizing this form for comedy and clashes with the noir aesthetic that the show is aiming for. But it helps that our MC is actually a bit likable. He’s a bit of that gruff, snide, and condescending asshole who can actually care for others. The artstyle is gritty and dark for the most part, but the animation is pretty good and fight scenes are generally good. The conspiracy narrative could do with a bit more but overall it has competent execution. My impression with the first few episodes is that this is a seinen that has somehow carved a unique identity and should be an interesting watch.<br />

    No Guns Life is the anime adaptation for the original Manga by Karasuma Tasuku and brings us a mix of Cyberpunk, Mystery, Crime and a protagonist with a gun for a head. I&#039;ve heard from a few people they felt the anime was ridiculous because of the superficial look of the main character, but I decided to let this show have an impact on me as I watch it.<br />
<br />
The most stellar feature of the show is that the world-building creates a setting that draws you into the story. You wonder what kind of wacky combinations of humanoid robots they can come up with and how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321640">
        the narrative and the story elements weave into one another. I can already tell you that the first 5 episodes were definitely not enough to understand what the hell is going on in this world. You encounter a lot of terms which only make sense in the realm of this fictional world like Extenders. Also, you want to learn about the significance of the boy and why everyone is trying to abduct him for themselves.<br />
<br />
We have our main protagonist Jûzo that&#039;s a capable &quot;Extender&quot;, a race of people that looks like they fused with machines. Jûzo has a gun for a head, but so far in the show, it is only cosmetics and he doesn&#039;t use it as a weapon. That doesn&#039;t make him less of a badass though. He speaks in such a cool demeanour and is also a rather cynical dude. He also does have a rather infantile side where he blushes for seeing something raunchy and behaves overall unfitting to the mood the scenery is trying to build up.<br />
<br />
There is a scene later where he gets a &quot;hair cut&quot; and has his eyes covered as enemy forces rush in to interrogate and threaten him. He doesn&#039;t lose his cool.<br />
<br />
The enemy designs are quite special, for example we have a mechanical spider robot or other kinds of machinations which give our characters a hard time. I really hope for some kind of Orwellian Dystopia to take place in this world mixed with a bit of critique of future technology.<br />
<br />
The Visuals are really nice and create an image of a modern city with some kind of scrapyard feel to it. The colours are vibrant but don&#039;t penetrate your eyes, generally, there is a lot of silver, grey, brown and metallic in the scenery. This creates a salvageable image of this machine city.<br />
<br />
I have to this point seen the first 5 episodes that released and I&#039;m eager to follow this show. A Season 2 is already on the Horizon and I picked up the manga so I can learn more about this intriguing show and its lore.<br />
<br />

    the most underrated anime this season is this one for sure .<br />
i will start with my personal experience with this show , at first i didn&#039;t care about this anime at all , i was just ignoring it but one day i felt that i need to see something different, so i started watching this anime , and boy i was surprised with the quality of the show.<br />
story 8/10 : i liked how the story isn&#039;t just about one character but 3 character and every episode we see things from the perspective of one of them and sometime they change the perspective in the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321843">
        episode it also keep you interested with the Mystery and suspense revolving around the characters and the mysterious evil company who chase the main character.<br />
art 8/10 : not the best out there but still unique and goes well with the general theme of the story <br />
sound 7/10 : good but nothing more than that .<br />
characters 8/10: the best thing about the anime was the characters all character are depth and has thier own motivation and the effect of thier background and past are noticable in the way they act and thier personality in general.<br />
overall there is few good anime worth watching this season and this is one of them , so make sure to give this anime a chance.

    No Guns Life is a series that I am grateful to have discovered. It&#039;s not a show that I normally would watch and had I not been introduced to it by a friend one night, probably never would have seen it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not normally a person who watches hard broiled detective series or movies, however I am a sucker for a good story and when I go into evaluating any anime/manga/LN I prioritise the story and world building. No Guns Life excels in that department and even if you aren&#039;t a person who normally likes this genre, you&#039;ll most likely enjoy the show because of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325132">
        world, characters and mystery.<br />
<br />
The gist of the story is that humans were genetically modified in order to fight as soldiers in a war, now that the war is over, those &quot;extended&quot; or modified humans are struggling to readjust to society amidst discrimination, mental and physical health issues, etc. The protagonist Juuzo, who is quite literally a smoking gun, is basically a PI who takes on cases from the biggest players in town, until he bites off more than he can chew by taking on a case involving the city&#039;s biggest corporation who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets in-house. Juuzo&#039;s latest case sets off a chain of events that could lead to the very unravelling of society.<br />
<br />
The mystery, character development, action scenes, etc are all well done and given it&#039;s madhouse, this really shouldn&#039;t come as a surprise. It&#039;s a seinen story and it feels seinen. The topics explored, the reoccurring motifs and character interactions feel mature and I appreciate that. The first season left a few things to be desired with pacing towards the end, but overall I was more than satisfied with this series and it will certainly be one of the hidden gems of 2019.<br />
<br />
Overall, No Guns Life is certainly worth a watch if you enjoy Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi thrillers, Mysteries, detective dramas, etc. <br />
<br />

    No Guns Life is a good anime... that&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not great, it&#039;s not bad, just good. The writing and execution is alright, but there&#039;s that sense that it has potential for a lot more, and it&#039;s a bit of a shame. Still, I enjoyed watching this the whole way through, and I&#039;m willing to concede this slow start for a strong comeback in the form of season two.<br />
<br />
I personally really enjoyed it, even if I know it&#039;s only a 7/10 at best. It&#039;s hard to describe, but I managed to stay engaged and interested the whole way through. I think people should eventually watch it,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325870">
        but I wouldn&#039;t go out of my way to tell them it&#039;s a priority or that it&#039;s the best.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m ready for season two. Do me proud!<br />
<br />
OVERALL 7/10

    An anime that should be action-packed interesting that ended up being a slog to get through. The concept of the world has promise, but it never delivers on that promise and potential. <br />
<br />
Yeah, in an anime landscape dominated by cute anime girls, ecchi, and isekai trash this may seem like a breath of fresh air. However, that’s all it is. A brief flash of interest before you watch a few episodes and are somehow bored of an anime where a man with a gun for a head fights other cyborgs. <br />
<br />
Literally everything about this anime is either run-of-the-mill or below average. The art and direction

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346815">
        were surprisingly subpar quite often and there were many instances of poor CGI. <br />
<br />
Remember how I said this anime seemed like a breath of fresh air from the abundence of ecchi in contemporary anime? Well it turns out that thought was misguided because every woman needs to wear some revealing article of clothing and there needs to be dedicated camera angles to highlight it. Why is this even something that must be shown for an anime set in a dark, distopian world? Am I supposed to get hard from this? Is this supposed to keep me interested because the creators know the story is ridiculously boring? <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, about that story, this was pretty much just 12 episodes of exposition. This is most evident when the final episode is pretty much separate from everything that happened earlier in the season. The entire season, characters and plotlines are introduced only to disappear until later in the series (most likely). But this means that the season has nothing it is building to, so it just says “fuck it” and uses the final episode to set up more characters and plotlines instead of giving a satisfying conclusion. <br />
<br />
The characters are pretty much all characters you have seen before and the bad guys are just portrayed as irredeemable evil with no real psychology behind their actions. <br />
<br />
The music was forgettable, but the OP was good if that matters for anything (it really doesn’t). <br />
<br />
Also there was some awful editing at points. Like, people didn’t even watch it before approving it bad. Maybe somebody at Madhouse did screen it but were put in a trance by how boring it is so they didn’t even notice it. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I know this review is long and makes it look like I hated it, but like I said before, it was just disappointing and subpar the majority of the time. I will not watch the sequal unless it is supposed to be REALLY good. Like above 8.20 good. <br />
<br />
It is closer to a 4 than a 2.

    Underrated would be an understatement. While some of the early reviews for this show may not have been stellar, I can tell you that it picks up as it progresses. The story becomes deeper, darker and more multifaceted and despite what others have said, the show isn&#039;t based on some pro or against gun philosophy, it has nothing to do with guns really.<br />
<br />
The real moral battle of the show is between humans, war, technology, and what it truly means to be human.<br />
<br />
We get a wide cast of interesting characters each with their own backstory, though most are not yet explored in depth, i can tell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323106">
        you from the passing this is on track for a second season.<br />
<br />
Art and sound are great. The world is a fantastic, if common, future dystonia brought about by a global war and struggling with the deeper integration between man and technology. Music is also great and i love the OP.<br />
<br />
Animation is solid and action is well done and thrilling. I can&#039;t recall any situations where i saw CGI, which either means there is none or it&#039;s very well done.<br />
<br />
Overall you should do yourself a favor and pick this show up. The first few episodes might make it seem like it&#039;s going to be some episodic crime drama but give it a second and you&#039;ll be hooked.<br />
<br />
Edit: I was totally right about it being on track for a second season, second season is here and I&#039;m hyped.

    No Guns Life is an anime from last year. The manga started in 2014 and is still ongoing. The anime version came from Madhouse. Let&#039;s just hope it came from their division that works on quality projects instead of their one that makes complete tripe.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Inui Juuzou is an Extended. Which is basically the term this series uses for cyborgs. He has a gun for a head and is able to function in normal society solely through cooperating with the authorities and he makes a living by taking on jobs involving other cyborgs. The anime basically covers a series of these jobs and Juuzou&#039;s struggles with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334937">
        the large, world ruling corporation Berühren.<br />
<br />
There are some pretty significant flaws. First off, we find out that Juuzou can&#039;t fire the gun on his own head because the trigger is in the back of his head... in a spot you could reach with a normal range of motion.... with no indication that he&#039;s hampered in that regard. And you can&#039;t say that someone needs special authorization, because we see it fired once in this series and it&#039;s by a kid. The ending is also pretty shit. Usually when you have a series like this, they&#039;ll try to make the ending satisfying even though they&#039;re going for a sequel by answering some big question, showing a major antagonist brought down or otherwise wrapping up some ongoing plot thread. In this one, they decided to give you a really boring case and leaving everything important to be wrapped up later.<br />
<br />
This also suffers from the same problem as a lot of 90s comics where they feel the need to constantly and quickly introduce the next thing so you can get into the action and the few moments where they take a break and could, potentially, work on character development end up being kind of rushed set ups for the next bit of action.<br />
<br />
About the best I can say for the series is that there are a few moments that are kind of interesting and none of its faults are so egregious that they absolutely ruin it or get obnoxious.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Hard bitten detective, naive kid with a mysterious power, girl in a supporting role who jokes around with the hero. It sounds clichéd because it is. The series also has one of those trans women characters who looks really masculine and acts flirtatious with men in a way that makes them uncomfortable. Because that&#039;s such a great trope.<br />
<br />
I also have to talk about the evil corporation. In something with strong writing that has an evil corporation, you&#039;ll see humanity from the people who work there and the company&#039;s evil actions will have some kind of profit-based motive behind them. In this one, there&#039;s an effort to do that but they just go too far with the evil deeds. We see them use children for cyborg experiments. We also see them decide to sacrifice a bunch of innocent civilians for very flimsy reasons. Which basically makes them Republic Serial villains without the sense of fun.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
This is another aspect I&#039;m going to compare to bad 90s comics. A lot of the cyborg character designs, including gun head, look to be going for the &quot;extreme&quot; aesthetic rather than looking good. The non-cyborgs tend to have some bizarre characteristic that just makes them look weird like Olivier&#039;s lips or Cronen&#039;s eyebrows. The action sequences are pretty good. They flow fairly well. The backgrounds are detailed. Maybe a bit too drab but detailed.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The acting is well done. Suwabe Junichi, Numakura Manami &amp; Ymashita Daiki all deliver their lines well. About the worst performances you get are from Ebara Masashi &amp; Ueda Youji. Ebara because the series has that typical, exaggerated, overly masculine trans character and that character always sounds awful. Ueda&#039;s performance is meant to sound like a slimy corporate man but he just comes across as hammy. <br />
<br />
Kawai Kenji&#039;s music is fine. It&#039;s not the best I&#039;ve heard from him by any means but it&#039;s basically functional. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s really none to be found. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
If Juuzou has limited range of motion and actually can&#039;t reach the back of his own head, illustrate that instead of just having the characters act like it&#039;s impossible to reach back there. It&#039;s awkward, but it&#039;s well within a normal person&#039;s range of motion. <br />
Don&#039;t make your corporation so cartoonishly evil. <br />
Better pacing with more time to develop your characters and their relationship dynamics would do wonders.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
This anime is a lot like a mediocre 90s comic, maybe a bit worse. With an extreme aesthetic, under-developed characters &amp; pacing that wants to rush anything character-based because they&#039;re worried that any atmosphere or character building will bore the audience. I&#039;m giving it a 4/10.

    Does not contain spoilers<br />
<br />
So, as you can see i gave this a rather mediocre score, therefore, let&#039;s start with the good, especially since there&#039;s not that much of it. Its studio madhouse. That&#039;s good i guess. The drawing is their iconic style, which looks great, especially on the main character, although weirdly enough, in this show even that style doesn&#039;t seem to be able to fill the picture with anything to stop it from feeling lacking. The design of the cyborgs is pretty neat. Overall picture (but not animation) quality is decent. Sound&#039;s good, the opening&#039;s great... That&#039;s about it really.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s the rest then? Dreadful.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325614">
        Without even joking, at least a third of the show you&#039;ll be greeted with the main character staring into space, usually while smoking. Another third you&#039;ll be listening to huge, shameless exposition bombs about the world and the relations between factions, other characters staring into space or saying/doing something cryptic that only they understand the significance of in the moment, you might understand it later too if you bother investing into understanding the poor lore, for whatever reason, because its honestly not worth it. Now, i&#039;d be lying if i said the last third that consists of the fights and interactions isn&#039;t kind of nice, which it is, but in the end, there&#039;s just so little of it, and the plot barely goes anywhere too, but i guess there&#039;s another season announced to (not) look forward to!<br />
<br />
Honestly one of the most average, even nearly below average and generic shows I&#039;ve ever watched, would not recommend it to ANYONE, even not to pass the time or huge fans of studio madhouse.

    This review contains heavy spoiler, but more like half way spoiler so not much is going to be spoiled.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I can only say: This series tries too hard to look hard boiled and grim. <br />
<br />
Summing it up, it&#039;s a post specially modified soldier from a great war being the main character. And he has a revolver for a head. Not a bad setting, if I got anything to say about it at all.<br />
<br />
However, it went off with too many themes after that. And spoiler alert, those are basically: victims of some overshadowing corporates, a ghost of old war, people trying hard to live but place the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328157">
        wrong bet and such. Well, they are not bad if it tries to be episodic. Yet, the plot keeps getting pushed forward with all kind of introduction. <br />
<br />
But even with all that introduction, there&#039;s nothing to see in character development. Soiler alert again: the kid stays the same thoughout 12 episodes, and he didn&#039;t even get to do shits to develop anything with though. The gun head got something dark going on, but it only knocks on the series a little bit, before going away again. <br />
<br />
Talking about &quot;a little bit before going away&quot;, that&#039;s pretty much how it goes with whatever happened in this series. Corporate&#039;s hunting escapee ends right in first act, after a fight and a busted pair of &quot;tool&quot;s, war crime related soldiers start talking about what the sacrifice for a war they paid but then got shot a little and both went silent, of course, no one say shits about it anymore, some old accquaintance got introduced as though it&#039;s going to continue (which I think it will) but never shows shit for the rest of the season. The only thing doesn&#039;t seem to go away was a little something from episode 12, which is the last one so yeah, it&#039;s not like just indication means much at this point. <br />
<br />
Talking about episode 12. What the hell? Why did it revert to episodic after a grim reminder of the past? Another request, another little girl needed to be saved. And really, it&#039;s kind of cheap plot to say a partner of the father deceive the daughter to gain something her father left behind but then shows his true color right after being revealed. And it&#039;s the plot for the freaking last episode. Well, if the series was all episodic, that kind of episode is acceptable. But it wasn&#039;t. We were like, walking on some grand cruiser half way, but had to sit on a 2-men boat to get to the shore for the last 100 miles/km/which ever unit of length goes. It breaks the chain of event, and doesn&#039;t even mean much. <br />
<br />
I understand that the series is continuing, so these might just be like a long series got cut off into different season. But come on, while so many series work as though they are going to end after 12 episodes, when they get 24 back to back, this one doesn&#039;t solve a thing left in the season. Everything got cut off as some dark force is manipulating it. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, the series tries hard to look cool, hard boiled and smart, but it doesn&#039;t sold a thing and leaves lots and lots of stuff related to main plot unsolved. While nothing you can&#039;t enjoy if you shut your brain down, it&#039;s definitely not something to be called good, let alone score high at all.

    I thought this was gunna be some edgy bs, but its actually great! A hard-boiled detective type who plays the straight man, but makes gun puns and is absolutely hilarious without ever acting as if he did anything funny. There are very few times he emotes (and only then in the form of a flustered, chibi-style face), but the acting is so well done, and the animation so excellent, that he never felt like a stiff character. Great female characters, interesting episodes, though the over-arching plot left some to be desired. The last two episodes are my favorite for this season, not because they&#039;re plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327458">
        heavy at all, but just a fun, interesting 2 episode plot about robot ghosts. It gets a little silly but has its heartfelt, genuine, tense moments as well.

    No Guns life and its universe show great potential  to develop in something great and truly meaningful.  Potential on its own can&#039;t justify  show short coming , its is important to keep  big picture in mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
On surface it can be seen and watched as action packed,  noir show about Dude with gun on his head, beating up bad guys  and being overall awesome and cool. If someone sees this show like that, its fine cause thats what show is about.<br />
<br />
However it can also be seen as gruesome depiction of late-state capitalism where everything and everyone is a product. Extension

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326345">
        don&#039;t exist to help people, but are used as schemes  to get people dependent on medicine, maintenance  and constant improvements. People are tools meant to be exploited for wealth.<br />
<br />
It also can be seen as show about Post war soldier.  Juzo being born to be nothing more than killing tool for military which created him and see how he struggles to find purpose in civilian life as well as battle against this idea that he just a tool meant to be used.<br />
<br />
What makes these themes even more appealing is that , show combines them well with its light hearted moments and action scenes that it doesn&#039;t come out as surface level preaching and virtue signaling.<br />
<br />
At what layer  you decide to watch the show  is upto to the viewer, although understanding that there is more to the show when just some action scenes, would let one enjoy the show to another level.<br />
<br />
Although there are things which nag me.<br />
<br />
1. Characters over all well designed , their appearance is distinctive  and  fit well into over all art style of the show. However, it might be age thing, turning 22 that surface level fan service  rubs me the wrong way.  Fact that out of 5 female characters, 2 are ninja nuns who were undersized triangle bra and stocking as their uniform, Olivier having massive and over exposed rack and even Scarlet being given standard large anime breasts.  Was bit off putting. If show has to flash half naked women in first 10 minutes of show, it gives you certain expectation about then show.<br />
<br />
2.Story in S1 isn&#039;t really that good. S1 seemed a lot more of an introduction to the world of No Guns Life, so there where a lot of few episode long arcs which didn&#039;t really go another, mainly served as character introduction and  world building. However there is second season coming out in 2020, so depending on how good it is , viewing experience of overall show might be a lot different from just first season.<br />
<br />
Those 2 nit picks aside show is pretty flawless. Art design and great, action scenes are directed well. Whenever juzo fights , you can feel the raw power and metalic hardness behind his blows. <br />
<br />
all of this is support what I&#039;d day pretty amazing  osts,  Opening has become one of my favorites.<br />
When you get depressed anime fan to watch Opening for majority of episodes, thats job well done in my book.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR  great looking show, with potential of exploring some interesting themes. You can watch it now and wait for S2 or wait until S2 comes out and watch both seasons back to back<br />
<br />

    -No Guns Life (first part ) &quot;different is good&quot;.-<br />
<br />
This anime was different from everything i had seen before. <br />
It has a good story, the animation is not that average type of animation but is good( it felt kinda strange for me at the beginning because i didnt watch animes like this before, but that wont stop you from enjoying the show at all).<br />
Watching this anime kinda gives you a relaxed sensation(at least for me it did)maybe because of the animation, dark themes and it&#039;s flow.<br />
This is one of the few animes that is &quot;safe&quot; to watch in public(this was my &quot;BUS anime&quot;, every friday i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324907">
        would watch the new episode while returning home from my university).<br />
<br />
Is this a must watch anime? Maybe not but this is good stuff so you should.<br />
Would i recommend? Yes

    No Guns Life is pretty second rate when it comes down to it.<br />
<br />
Animations pretty good, but some CGI take it too far. Sound is alright, but some of the OST is downright cheesy. Characters are fine, just kind of uninventive and done a million times.<br />
<br />
This show does not bring a lot to the table. It takes old, proven, and tested plot points, aesthetic, and storyline and jams them into one story. Old detective with a deep past. Random companion that follows main character. Mysterious boy with powers that is escaping a facility. Corruption of conglomerates vs the main character. Steampunk.<br />
<br />
And well, what do you expect?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330380">
        It becomes basic. Nothing stands out. The gimmick with the gun becomes old when you realize that the MC is as bland as it gets. I swear to god, the dialogue of the MC is just...so predictable. I mean, Mary is the only character that&#039;s got more than five dialogue options for each conversation. The boy has an extremely idealistic goal and tries to achieve it throughout the show. Never heard of that before.<br />
Nothing seems to make a lot of sense behind any of the characters&#039; actions either. They just establish extremely normal personalities and have them do actions according to what&#039;s really convenient for the plot.<br />
And to top it off? Apparently, no killing is allowed or something. What is this, PG? The gore is literally nonexistant. Fights just are &quot;fights.&quot; No one fights to kills, like not even the enemy, apparently. I get that overly gory shows are terrible, but can a show basically all about fighting be relevant when no one is trying to kill each other. It&#039;s not a shounen. Why are people fighting like it is?<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the execution of the story now. It&#039;s also bad. The show clearly wants the motif about &quot;failed experimented children struggle,&quot; to be prevalent throughout the show. Or how about, &quot;corrupted people are evil.&quot; But it really doesn&#039;t feel that way. It doesn&#039;t draw empathy. The show kind of just puts it there, and leaves it. It shows, doesn&#039;t tell. There&#039;s no backstory. It&#039;s painfully linear and not explored. I&#039;m getting flashbacks to the &quot;tragic backstory of every demon ever&quot; in Kimetsu no Yaiba.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the plot doesn&#039;t make any sense, either. The &quot;evil corrupt corporation&quot; that is chasing down the protagonists just employ the most ineffective strategies to beat the main character. They even know where he is. They just, send in men one by one I guess. Alright?<br />
<br />
Look, the show isn&#039;t terrible. It&#039;s just not original. You can watch it. It&#039;s not bad. But if you actually want to see something different and well thought out, definitely don&#039;t watch.
