        battles enough time to satisfy fans of action. The character designs are on the whole attractive albeit generic, but here we come to our first problem, the protagonist Haruyuki.<br />
<br />
I get it, Haru is supposed to be a character with low self esteem, otherwise they wouldn&#039;t have brought in Yuki Kaiji to voice him, but the character design they chose to demonstrate this was insulting to the viewers. Looking at him, it shows the designers attempt to force down our throats the fact that this guy is vulnerable and a &quot;loser&quot;, but at the same time still not be ugly enough to put us off, which is why he is chibi, rendering him completely different from every other character in the show. Why did they feel the need to do this? I get the feeling they think the audience is stupid, and need constant reminders of why this guys has no confidence, they even made his avatar a small pig, just to reiterate this further, because you are that stupid.<br />
<br />
This leads me onto Haru himself and the rest of the characters. His best friend Taku is generic, seems to have no romantic chemistry with his girlfriend Chiyu (indeed Haru has more), doesn&#039;t add much to the series, but is at least likable. Although her relationship with Haru was odd (i.e. romantic), Chiyu was alright initially, but later in the series she becomes incredibly obnoxious. Kuroyukihime is the most likable character, partly because of her pleasant disposition and good design, but mostly because she got a pass on the second half of the series on account of being on holiday. The side characters lack depth and are completely non descript, the enemies are infuriating (and not for the reasons they should be), and then there is Haru. I&#039;d be amazed if anyone could manage to actually like this guy, unless he is so similar to them disliking him is an act of self loathing. The amount of hatred I built up watching him was one thing, but then the second half of the series happened.<br />
<br />
Now obviously I won&#039;t spoil anything, but let me just say, the second half of Accel World has some of the most rage inducing episodes you&#039;ll come across. Why? The characters start acting in completely illogical and infuriating ways, I had just forgiven Haru for the first half of the series when he just goes downhill in a spectacular fashion, the show starts introducing plot devices that either make little sense or break the setting Accel World itself, and the plot degrades terribly. Indeed, this half was so poor they had to introduce a few episodes of filler in the middle to give you time to calm down. The antagonist has at his disposal seemingly every plot contrivance possibly, and an ability that would never be allowed in any game of that sort.<br />
<br />
In fact, a major factor in why I ended up being so angry is due to the blatantly poor plot devices and elements that were poorly thought out and look like ass pulls. It shows laziness in the writing, or a simple lack of ability. I was shocked often throughout the second half at how stupid these things were, and this did not help the infuriating exchanges at all.<br />
<br />
So, in all, the second half was terrible, indeed I&#039;d give it a 1 overall. It did have some nice battles, some fan service and some really spectacular background settings, but when you have to watch this in tandem with the genuinely upsetting nature of the show (where whenever the antagonist is on screen your head will find itself drawn to the oven) the experience is irredeemable. The first half was better, and many will have or will enjoy the first half, but I didn&#039;t really like it either. For someone who is the protagonist because they are good at games, Haru really sucks at games, he makes rookie errors and shows a lack of judgement that makes you wonder about his ability. To be fair to him this is simply more usage of plot devices, and I would forgive him for that, but he&#039;s an irritating waste of space who only serves to pander to the viewers inadequacies and insecurities. He is not a decent character, he is only there to make people who identify with him feel better for themselves. That is the only reason I can imagine someone liking this show at all to be honest.<br />
<br />
Accel World is certainly not all bad, it has some decent episodes which always include exciting fighting, some of the side characters are likable, and the world setting was fantastic in terms of aesthetics, however these happy instances were always in between long durations of anger, misery and frustration. Many may enjoy it, I certainly don&#039;t speak for all opinions, but for me watching Accel World was an experience devoid of enjoyment or fun, the way this anime is set up makes it inherently dubious, but it is the execution that really cause such grief that I wanted to cause harm to myself. I hope this never gets a sequel.

    Hey you! Yeah you, the humongous loser. Are you a humongous loser? Are you convinced your lack of physical attractiveness is the sole factor preventing you from attracting members of the opposite sex? Is your only skill in life that you&#039;re really good at a computer game? Well now there&#039;s an anime just for you!<br />
<br />
Our male lead is a chubby little kid who gets bullied by spikey haired shounen protagonists. He spends the vast majority of the episode whining about his condition, wishing he could just disappear into this video game world. We&#039;re clearly supposed to feel sorry for him, so forgive me if that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57787">
        comes off as false when he already has two friends, one of whom is a cute girl who makes him lunch. Oh dear nobody loves me, except for my two friends who are trying to care for me, aren&#039;t I just the most sympathetic character ever. Also sorry for not feeling particularly sympathetic for fat people when they spend their time running around a virtual sporting environment and then lament the state of the body.<br />
<br />
I called Accel World a Shana Clone pre-season, but that isn&#039;t strictly true. For my personal definition of the Shana Clone, the main character needs to be a personality-less everylead who has no defining features beyond the fact that they&#039;re kind of nice. Being a humongous loser is an improvement on that, albeit only if played correctly. A wimpy character has to develop so nice things can happen to them. The alternative is something like Future Diary or Evangelion, where the main character has something great fall into their lap, but their inability to mature means it actively worsens their lives. There has to be a pull/push to this. Something falling into a characters lap and instantly improving their life at no cost is not good storytelling. It&#039;s just wish-fulfillment of the laziest order.<br />
<br />
Now with that in mind, let&#039;s take a look at what Accel World does. Main character&#039;s ability at this obscure computer game results in the prettiest girl in the school dragging him over, caressing the inside of his leg and giving him magical powers. He now has to compete in games where the if he wins, he gains extra points in tests and a whole bunch of other stuff. But ooh, does it come at a cost? Why yes, if he loses, he&#039;s no longer part of the game! So, does he get disconnected from the entire network? Err, no. Does he get damaged in the real world, .Hack style? Err, no. Absolutely nothing happens to him whatsoever. The extent of what happens to him is he no longer has bullies after him, he keeps his old friends, and he had a short romantic skirmish with the prettiest girl in school. Oh dear. I feel so sorry for your predicament. Let me play you the worlds smallest violin.<br />
<br />
Another thing Accel World appears to struggle with is that it&#039;s a story, not a video game. Yes, I&#039;m aware they are playing a video game inside the world. Thanks, the health bars and attack sheets gave that away. You don&#039;t need to give me a fucking tutorial for every single part of the fucking match. I&#039;m not playing the game, I don&#039;t need to see that sort of stuff. Yet still, for large portions of the episode, our token pretty lady cycled through the rules and regulations on how to attack. Not important stuff that would affect the story. Basic video game rules that we could have figured out for ourselves based on the simplest of visual cues that it gave us anyway. You don&#039;t need to adapt a light novel verse by verse. Use the animated medium to show that stuff a book needs to spell out for you to understand.<br />
<br />
Character designs are the same generic noseless shiny people you see all over the place, with the exception of chubby-san. The animation, apart from some neat CG effects in the fight scenes, is bland and forgettable. Heck, if you&#039;re going to be this shockingly blatant about wish-fulfillment, you might as well drop in some service, but there&#039;s not even any of that. It&#039;s an imaginary world for loser males in the real world to drop themselves into, wishing they too had a cute girl come caress their leg because they&#039;re really good at a video game. Blergh.

    	So... the chubby main character is bullied in school and was soon introduced to a new world(video game) and will aim to become the best! How exciting? <br />
Although we could summarize this anime this way, but its like saying Code Geass is about a high school kid trying to kill his dad after he got superpowers. There&#039;s simply more to it.<br />
<br />
	The first thing about this anime that really appealed to me was the atmospheric building. Eyes were everywhere, no matter where the main character went, somebody is around him. Since Haruyuki is quite a loser himself, he really hated to be around people, although most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59307">
        people weren&#039;t really noticing him. This could be the one of the best way to tell us that our main character is a complete loser in the real world but he is great at video games.<br />
<br />
Rating:<br />
My rating for this anime looks REALLY subtle, there are really no huge up and downs and it&#039;s mainly because almost every aspect of this anime has something special about it.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
The story of this anime is actually quite creative. Although the concept of characters being able to go into different worlds isn&#039;t something completely new, the idea of turning this amazing but over-used concept into a basic setting where everyone is capable of doing so due to technology is actually more amusing than I expected. <br />
The main character has something and someone that he wants to protect and will probably want to become the strongest because of that which is really nothing new, but this overly simple motif actually adds a very inviting feeling to this anime.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Animetography(cinematography for anime)10/10<br />
This is one special thing I really want to add to this review! Usually this component simply blends in with the art and sound part of an anime; however, this component of Accel World really appealed to me. <br />
<br />
I was really worried about the third episode of this anime. Since I read the manga of Accel World, I knew that there will be really large conversations and almost no fancy special effects involved at all, but the third episode did not disappoint me at all. The first half of the third episode is basically a conversation between Haruyuki-kun and Kuroyukihime sempai. They used &quot;direct link&quot; to talk to each other meaning that they do not need to actually speak. This is something only anime could produce the most effectively because a 10 minute conversation will show tons of expressions and the characters and show their expressions in a better way if they did not need to open their mouths all the time. The quick cuts was also an important component that really made this part interesting. The &quot;camera&quot;(not that anime really have cameras) is constantly moving and only stops when an important expression is needed to be made, which mean tension also keeps building up. The shadow decreases once the two agrees on their commonality and goes on to discuss about another topic. This conversation ended up being very interesting due to the tension building and the sudden but subtle release of tension. Of course, thanks to the original creator of the light novel, the contents of this conversation was the core of keeping this part interesting. <br />
And HAHA! now we know that Accel World is not just another fancy battle + special effect anime that people will skip the boring episodes and just watch the cool fights.<br />
<br />
Since the main character of this anime does lots of reasoning throughout the anime, the varieties of positions that the main character is composed in also helped make the story a lot more interesting.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Art 9/10<br />
<br />
The art in the real world(especially school) seems very bright, even to an uncomfortable extent since school is a very uncomfortable place for Haruyuki. The real world is also drawn with a really subtle feel which contrasts with the world in the Brain Burst program. The Brain Burst program consists of more shadowy places and feels very surreal since all the colors of the real world is altered and everyone in there has a specific color to them. Yet, the Haruyuki finds the accelerated world a more inviting place for him.<br />
( I can BS about this stuff for years but the best thing about the art is still the character arts!)<br />
<br />
The character art for this anime is very nice. Every important character in this anime is drawn in a very detailed fashion, but not detailed enough that characters start to look annoying. The illustration for the two main female characters that have appeared so far is astonishingly good. The cute illustrations of Chiyuri fits her character really well, her avatar in the school network is also very appealing. And Kuroyukihime sempai is just AMAZING! Her illustration, especially her hair and her school network avatar fits her prominent position really well. She is definitely my favorite heroine of spring 2012! <br />
<br />
Just the illustration itself for the main character, Haruyuki, looks promisingly negative and I really hope they could make a better illustration for the main character. But let us all ask ourselves one question :&quot;Is there a better way to illustrate someone who is only good at video games and is a complete loser in reality who also feels really bad about himself than a short and fat kid with stupid-looking eyes?&quot; My answer is definitely NO&quot;<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
OP is ok~ it feels quite unique but to me, it does not sound quite great. I loved the ED, it sounds pleasant to the ear and it fits the feeling of the anime really well.<br />
<br />
The background noise+music for this anime is great. The background music changes many times throughout the long conversations between Haruyuki and Kurohime. The background music is definitely what makes the long conversations interesting and even, at times, make simply talking feel very cool and exciting. <br />
<br />
The voice actors are very professional and dedicated. The voice actor for Haruyuki is Kaji Yuki, who is a great voice actor for those &quot;I dunno what to do next but I need to protect ___&quot; characters. (Example: Ouma, Shu from Guilty crown, Amata Sora from Aquarion Evol and Issei from High school DXD). Chuyuri&#039;s voice actress also fits her cheerful and cute tone very well. What amazes me the most is the voice actress of Kuroyukihime. This is the first anime that this voice actress got a major role in, yet, she fits the character really well and her skills are very dedicated and developed.<br />
<br />
Character 9.5/10 (lots of this section is already explained in the art and the sound section)<br />
The motif for the actions of the major characters in Accel World is very simple, they simply hang on to one thing and all they do is for completing that task and usually, this becomes a downside of an anime because it&#039;s overly simple. However, in this case, I think this feeling is exactly what this anime needs.<br />
<br />
So far, the character development speed for most of the characters have been very slow since we are still being introduced to some of the important backgrounds of the characters, but the characteristics of all the major characters is already very clear.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10 <br />
One episode of Accel World goes by extremely fast, leaving me craving for more. <br />
In general dedicated humor + romance with beautiful heroines + Great action is just great! But more importantly, I don&#039;t think we really need a reason to enjoy an anime. Accel world is one of the most enjoyable anime I&#039;ve ever watched and that is all the reason I need to give this section a big 10/10!<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
<br />
I really want to give this anime a 10/10 because I simply love it, but generally speaking, 9/10 is where this anime is at since there are a few things that could be done better.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this anime mainly to battle or sci-fi lovers, especially the type that loves mental battles. But I also want to recommend Everyone to watch this amazing anime! Believe me, this anime will be enjoyable. I cannot guarantee that everyone will love this anime, but this Accel World will definitely be a waste of 25 minutes.<br />

    I&#039;m not going to play the game of “is this a good series??” here folks. Accel World is one of those series that will invoke nerdgasm towards those who have a strange taste of the cyber world. This piece of work that Sunrise is presenting here can be described as a wildly entertaining phenomenon that blurs between the lines of fiction and reality.<br />
<br />
Accel World (sometimes also known as the Accelerated World) is an anime adapted series written by Reki Kawahara. The author is also involved with the immensely popular ongoing series, Sword Art Online. Both series focuses on futuristic technology beyond our times that involves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72843">
        players fighting in the other world for survival and bragging rights with that sense of technical nerdgasm.<br />
<br />
The story of the series takes place in 2046 where “neuro-synchronization”, a powerful piece of advanced technology that allows manipulation of different senses. Now, imagine that. In about 34 years, God knows what will happen of our world or even the Accelerated World. Nonetheless, the series stars Haruyuki Arita who has a low social esteem of himself as result of his physical appearance and views of the world. The kid spends his time playing virtual games mindlessly to void of the reality that he wants to rid of. That of course, changes one day when he meets the popular girl of the series, Kuroyukihime. With the beauty style of a butterfly, she forms a bond with Haruyuki-kun and together, they become close friends, partners, and even a couple at times.<br />
<br />
Now, the theme of the virtual world as well as some of its key elements are not new to the anime industry. Series such as the .hack franchise, the old school Digimon series, and even movies such as Summer Wars also have some of these elements. Sword Art Online also incorporates some of these themes such as the avatar and duel ideas. Given the fact that Reki Kawahara wrote both stories, it is no surprise at all. He presents to the viewers the line that separates fiction and reality by showing rather than telling. <br />
<br />
Although there are many characters involved in the series in several intertwined arcs, the series has four main characters who all become friends for the bonds they share whether be friendship, trust, or romance. As mentioned before, Haruyuki Arita begins the series as a kid with low esteem. He&#039;s one of those guys that have little trust in others or even himself. Yet, as the series progresses, so does his character and development. This is especially shown in later episodes where everything he does seems to be for the sake of others. That of course is thanks to the school idol of the series, Kuroyukihime. She is what represents the series as the goddess of paradise, the supreme beauty, and at times, a jealous butterfly wanting more nectar. But what she most desires is the position of level 10 as the strongest king and finding out the truth of the Accelerated World. That and of course, she also becomes the voice of a haughty girl and reason for Haruyuki-kun at times when he needs it the most. Speaking of what Haruyuki-kun needs the most beyond his virtual games that he plays are his friends. Chiyuri (also known as Chiyu) in the series is the cheerful childhood friend of Haruyuki-kun. She represents the light that Haruyuki-kun often looks forward at school and at home when he feels lonely. She is dating Takumu/Taku and both of them shares a bond with Haruyuki that far outreaches the virtual deception.<br />
<br />
Being tagged as a shounen, a viewer can expect a lot of action. In fact, the first episode immediately presents this as Haruyuki-kun is thrown into conflict with adversaries that far outreaches his troubles in the real world. Sunrise mixes in the action well but at times seems to be a bit forced in and predictable. In fact, there are a few times when you watch the series and might think “oh, I&#039;ve seen this stuff before”. In a nutshell, it&#039;s Accel World and the action is accelerated so expect those fast paced combat scenes. Additionally, the author makes usage of many technical terms (Brain Burst, Incarnate System, Direct Link) that all fits within the theme of cybernetic technology. <br />
<br />
The story itself however has a relative pace. It follows the light novels in the beginning but with some cut out parts as well as some intertwined pacing. In addition, each title represents a technical term with the letters “tion”  added on that turns a verb into a noun. It can be served as a symbolism as the action (what might happen in the episode) into an execution (what actually happens). It is also interesting to see not only Haruyuki-kun&#039;s development but some of the other characters as well such as Taku. At first, he holds some antagonism towards him but later on treasures him as a dear friend. To take things into different perspective, Kuroyukihime also becomes one of Haruyuki-kun&#039;s most treasured friend, partner, mentor, and lover. <br />
<br />
The overall coordination of the story seems to be alright but sometimes seems to be out of pace. For in stance in the latter half of the series, there are some episodes that seems to drag on and on focusing on a single antagonist. That and with an addition of a side story in between seems to throw the viewers off balance a bit and shifting focus. Sunrise and the director of the series (Masakazu Obara) wants to presents this series adapted from the LN but also wants to mix in some additional arcs to spice things up. Although it does work at times, some of the more episodes seems to decelerate with the pacing. In fact, the main story is never technically resolved.  Kuroyukihime didn&#039;t reach level 10 and her dream still remains in shadow for now. Furthermore, the finale of Accel World is almost like saying “series is now over so log off now. Season 2 in the future? Who knows”.<br />
<br />
The visual artwork of the series is decent to say the least. The artwork of the avatars as well as the different settings of the Accelerated World ranging from ocean, city, wasteland, to forest are all presented well to portray the fantasy like themes. On the outside world, the school&#039;s background is those of a typical school with far superior technology than our own of course. It&#039;s not too special though and for this season, it&#039;s just decent and fits within the theme of the overall series well.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack on the other hand is coordinated and delivered very well in my estimation. The sound director Yota Tsuruoka (Bakemonogatari, Full Metal Panic, Rozen Maiden, Shigofumi) is known to be a talented individual who has shown many of his skills. His variety of soundtrack whether it&#039;s mysterious, comedic, action packed, or eerie, are all incorporated within Accel World. It is no surprise that he was hired for the job with a man of such talent. Accel World has an excellent soundtrack and is like eargasm pleasure to hear the style of its delivery. <br />
<br />
The OP songs of course are also pleasant to hear. The first opening song, “Chase the world&quot; by May&#039;n, has a good rhythm and beat to it. It even coordinates the loner Haruyuki-kun in the beginning and his development over time in the series. That and the montage of some of the potential adversaries in the series also shows the upcoming action. The second opening song “Burst The Gravity&quot; by ALTIMA  follows a similar style and delivers the music at an accelerated rate, just like it should be. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, Accel World is a strange, exciting, accelerated, and engaging experience. The usage and execution of the virtual world theme is nothing new but somehow, it manages to get its point across to the viewers. The characters&#039; development and seeing how they deal with both reality and virtual reception is entertaining to watch. The soundtrack and artwork are something to think about especially the former with the talented Yota Tsuruoka in charge. The series does suffer setbacks such as the resolution of the finale as well as some of the intertwined fillers that seems to throw viewers off focus. Additionally, the series is quite predictable and some of the episodes seems to drag in the later episodes. In the end, Accel World is one of those series that blends fiction and reality. Perhaps in about 30 or so years, we can see what&#039;s like when our world is accelerated.

    From the uncreative mind that dumped Sword Art Online into your face comes his other famous light novel series, Accel World. I really don&#039;t see how people actually think Reki Kawahara&#039;s works are good. They&#039;re not. They&#039;re merely otaku-pandering wish fulfillment that&#039;s all style and no real effort put into them. Although Accel World is better than Sword Art Online, only by a little.<br />
<br />
This 24-episode adaptation by Sunrise is set in the year 2046, where people have wireless access to the internet using NeuroLink, which is basically a computer built into your body. The story follows a junior high school student named Haruyuki Arita, who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93315">
        has very low self-esteem due to being bullied for his short, chubby, unnatural appearance. He spends his time in playing online games, but one day, he finds that someone beat his high score in a game that only he plays because no one else does.<br />
<br />
That someone is the student council vice-president named Kuroyuki-hime, and she offers Haruyuki an opportunity to &quot;break his own reality&quot; and enter a fighting video game where the winner rules the online world and losers get kicked out. It also give him the power to move at a thousand times normal speed.<br />
<br />
Interesting premise, I&#039;d say, but there&#039;s a problem here: If you&#039;ve read my Sword Art Online review, then most of the problems there apply here: Good ideas, bad execution. Every single episode left me utterly bored because the characters would rather explain how stuff in the show works rather than actually show it. The only time where I&#039;m paying attention is during the fighting scenes.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the presentation is good. If the art and sound is passable, then there&#039;s nothing much I can say. The fighting scenes are pretty cool, despite them feeling a bit too similar to Pokemon battles. The avatar design accompanying the fighting are also well-designed, too. Aside from Haruyuki&#039;s, the character designs are fine, nothing special about them.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are just as flat and boring as the execution itself. I&#039;m beginning to think Kawahara has a knack for writing awful characters...<br />
<br />
And holy crap, these are bad characters. Haruyuki is damn annoying. First of all, he&#039;s a big, fat crybaby who whines about everything and stuffs his face with food. It doesn&#039;t help that he&#039;s voiced by Yuuki Kaji. If you&#039;ve entered this after watching Guilty Crown like I have, Haruyuki comes off as a whinier, chubby, buttugly Shu Ouma, right down to sharing the same seiyuu. Nothing againt him; I like him but there are very few roles I can think of where he doesn&#039;t voice a character that whines alot. At least Shu gets it together even though it took him longer than it should. At the end of Accel World, I don&#039;t think he ever got it together. None of his character improved, if there was any to begin with.<br />
<br />
Now Kuroyuki-hime I have more to type about because I hate her the most. She&#039;s supposedly one of the strongest players, but she makes Haruyuki do her dirty work because she&#039;s too lazy to do it herself, which she can. In one scenario, a player whose levels are less than half of her&#039;s attempts to blackmail her and even try to kill her in the real world. She does nothing but make Haruyuki deal with him instead of crusing the guy herself. What&#039;s really odd is that none of her motivations are really explained. She chose Haruyuki of all peoplem, falls in love with him. Why? ...He&#039;s good at video games, I guess. That&#039;s pretty much it. She started out interesting but later just became a boring character whose main purpose is to be the series&#039; sex object. Honestly, try to find one piece of Accel World merchandise where she isn&#039;t at least half-naked. Speaking of which, in the second half, she&#039;s away on a class vacation. We get two episodes of what she&#039;s up to, which consists of mostly her in a skimpy black bikini, probably to cater to the horny fanboys.<br />
<br />
We also have Haruyuki&#039;s childhood friend Chiyuri. She&#039;s the nice, sweet, innocent girl who is in love with Haru that she&#039;s dating his best friend. Likely out of jealousy, but never really elaborated, like most things in this series. She was okay at first, but then her feelings tend to contradict each other alot. She&#039;s furious at Haru because Kuroyuki-hime&#039;s interested in him. If she&#039;s so upset about it, then why did she choose to date his friend instead of him. And for some reason, whenever she and Haruyuki have an argument, it usually ends with her getting undressed. Whatever drama that was building up is killed due to unneccesary fanservice and the chick&#039;s inability to keep her clothes on. <br />
<br />
Like I mentioned, in the second half, Kuroyuki-hime is away, leaving Haruyuki to deal with a schoolmate named Seiji Noumi. Ugh, this little asshole made me drop the series at one point. He is a carbon copy of Sword Art Online&#039;s Nobuyuki Sugou in that he has no motivation to his actions and the stuff he does is so stupid, he might as well be wearing a sign saying &quot;I am the villain.&quot; He talks big, but doesn&#039;t do anything to make him look like a serious threat. He just makes Haruyuki and anyone close to him his own whipping boy. <br />
<br />
Those are just the worst characters. I don&#039;t mention the rest of the main cast because they&#039;re decent for the most part, like Takumu (Haruyuki&#039;s friend and Chiyuri&#039;s boyfriend). It&#039;s just that when you have bad main characters, the rest of the story falls with them.<br />
<br />
There really is nothing good, let alone special about Accel World. It&#039;s just a big ball of unused ideas, cliches, poor execution, and bad characters, which leads to a bad series with wasted potential. I don&#039;t know what message Kawahara is trying to portray here... &quot;You&#039;ll succeed at life if you&#039;re good at video games?&quot; Uh... no! Video games can be a means to escape reality, but that doesn&#039;t eliminate whatever issues in reality that are present. That&#039;s not how life works, and anyone who thinks so definitely needs a reality check.

    Accel World: The show where the only ridiculously fat-short boy ever(!) finds himself in a harem filled with your typical cliches, fan service and plot. Clearly, this show can&#039;t be worth watching... Yet, despite all these and its other horrendous flaws, it is.<br />
<br />
Unlike other shows without redeeming qualities, Accel World does do some things right.<br />
<br />
For one, it&#039;s hard not to get absorbed in its well imagined and detailed world. From the basic yet intriguing neuro linkers to the augmented reality they can bring forth, there is a ton of cool ideas in Accel World. Whether you enjoy the romantic idea of directly linking to your

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167781">
        partner or the concept of speeding up your brains neural activity, the show will leave with lots to think about. It is something Reki Kawahara seems especially good at adding to his stories.<br />
<br />
What will absolutely destroy the show for you however, is the second half of the show (which is also a common trend with Reki Kawahara&#039;s works). It&#039;s not per say that its so brutal, more that it is a huge letdown and mostly irrelevant to the overall plot. It also goes on for way too long and feels very segmented.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the poor final half, don&#039;t let it turn you off. Accel World is a good show. By no means is it great but it is still imaginatively inspiring. It&#039;s also nice to see a digital world portrayed in different way than your typical VR anime and to have real life consequences too. Overall, Accel World is worth watching but be prepared to be disappointed when it fails to maintain the high it does so well to build.

    So I heard you hate life. Here&#039;s a video game that you can play IN real life! Now do you like life more? Even though you can only stay in the game for 1200 seconds which only amounts to about a second in the real world. Don&#039;t worry. McDonalds will be served.<br />
<br />
Putting an obese protagonist in a show isn&#039;t done much. And I didn&#039;t expect shounen shows to have a fat ass, who hates his life, as a main character. Don&#039;t get me wrong though, I don&#039;t mind how the main character usually looks, but if the personality is this annoying, I&#039;d rather have someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60867">
        punch him out and end the show in one episode.<br />
<br />
So our main character hates his life a lot, the reason is unknown because his life is not suicidal bad. He acts alone, unloved, he complains and he cries, he just hopes that he dies. Yet he has two friends, one who makes lunch for him and an &quot;obviously-soon-to-be-enemy-for-one-battle&quot; friend. But of course the male friend also cares for this fat ass, emo, main character. His name is &quot;Haruyuki&quot; and we&#039;re supposed to feel sad for him. Really now. His bitchy complaining and bitching about his life pisses me off. He doesn&#039;t have to keep repeating pathetic shit because I got it the first time. He&#039;s depressed. I don&#039;t feel sorry for him, I want him to die (Just drawings, I&#039;m not like this to real people).<br />
<br />
Alright then. So we have a Teenage boy who goes to high school. He has one friend who will obviously go against him for a while and a female friend who he obviously likes. Just your average emo kid who gets bullied here. But then a girl comes along.....<br />
What the hell is fuckin wrong with these people? In anime, whenever there&#039;s a high school boy with a pathetic personality, a GIRL COMES ALONG AND GIVES HIM POWERS! Yes again. But why? Why must there always be a girl that grants him magical powers? I&#039;m getting pissed off with the amount of &quot;Magic girl gives boy powa&quot; shitty anime going around. An example would be Guilty Crown or Sacred Seven.<br />
<br />
Accel World takes place in a world where everything&#039;s high-tech. So you can log in to some virtual world in your school area and virtually &quot;chill&quot;. Or you can virtually exercise like our fatty does. Pretty smart ain&#039;t he? It&#039;s like Wii Fit without the movement, amazing technology. There&#039;s also a new way of communicating with someone. So there&#039;s this cord. You connect one side of it on your neck, and the other side with the person you want to talk with. Then you send thought-like messages to each other. You can also check their data. Are these people humanoids? Honestly what the fudge. I&#039;m quite sure no one wants robotic parts installed in them, especially ones that others can easily install a virus or a tracking device in. Hell if they can check your memories, then WHAT THE FK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHY WOULD YOU NOT CARE ABOUT THIS STUFF? What if they look at what you do in the bathroom broski.... And also by &quot;wiring&quot; with someone, I&#039;ll call it &quot;wiring&quot; because I forgot what it is, people see you as a couple. It&#039;s like kissing but with cords that attach to your neck.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s cut this short. Haruyuki met a girl in his virtual tennis game who liked him for beating her score. She then invites him to lunch with her and gives him a magical power. With this magical power he can go into the virtual world of the real world and fight against others. It&#039;s like Street Fighter, you just fight someone and win. If you lose, you get kicked from the game and you can&#039;t go back because you only had one coin. But if you win, you get experience! YAY! And your main goal is to be the best in the game, even though you will win nothing.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s too much moe. Moe is fucking disgusting. Character designs are the same as those other ones that reflect light like a mirror does, with their skin. Everyone looks the same, there&#039;s nothing new and unique here at all. Expect the big guy. Fight scenes are extremely lame. For some anime with no story at all, and only focused on a virtual game based on fighting, I EXPECT GOOD PEWPEW MATCHES YOU PATHETIC WRITERS!<br />
<br />
Accel World is about shiny people playing an Action MMORPG. They will go into detail to explain it to you, even though you&#039;re just watching the crappy show, and not playing the game.

    Although Accel World is technically outstanding, and the plot devices and story attracted my interest, I couldn&#039;t help but find the execution lacking.<br />
<br />
The main character, Haruyuki Arita is like many other shonen protaginists - persistent, strong-willed, and willing to protect the things he cares about. However, that is only a small part of his personality. He is also, bluntly put, a big loser; this is due in large part to him being short, fat, unattractive, and constantly bullied. He even has attractive friends that he constantly compares himself to in order to make himself feel bad. He&#039;s pathetic enough to make you cringe at times.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61891">
        Personally, I never really connected to him even though I wouldn&#039;t exactly call myself popular and have gone through periods of bullying. This of course is my personal opinion. who knows, maybe you&#039;ll connect with him yourself.<br />
<br />
Also, the conflicts experienced in the anime thus far have also been extremely shallow; there is always a GOOD side and an EVIL side, black and white, no grey. <br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT!!!! SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED EPISODE 5<br />
<br />
An example of the aforementioned shallowness occurred in ep 05; the protagonist&#039;s best friend turns out to be bad. Yeah, he was evil. After a small fight and some dramatic yelling, he saw the error of his ways and returned to the good side. Very simplistic although I guess it can&#039;t be faulted in a shonen.<br />
<br />
END OF SPOILERS<br />
<br />
The final issue is the over-dramatization. Although the anime makes a fair attempt at creating serious, somber relationships, situations, and scenes, it goes over the top and it ends up taking itself too seriously which makes things seem cheesy - so much so that I rolled my eyes at many of the more awkward scenes. They&#039;re not horrible, just too overpowering.<br />
<br />
In summary, This technically proficient shonen series with a decent setting and premise is marred by its awkward cheesiness, and superficial conflicts. I recommend you read the synopsis and watch a few episodes before placing judgement since I understand that it does appeal with many people. If you&#039;re reading this and I didn&#039;t completely scare you off, give it a shot, you never know.

    Accel World was one anime that I honestly did not have many expectations for. The main reason being: before watching the show, I have constantly been hearing about how bad the main character looks, and that his personality is horrible. As such, when I was watching the anime, I made it a point to ignore these comments, and to go in with an open mind, then judge the anime from there. Honestly, I was really surprised by just how good it turned out to be.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10)<br />
<br />
A short summary of Accel World is that this is set in the future, where humans have a device known

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135695">
        as the Neuro Linker which makes a person somewhat like a walking computer. Think of it like the Google Glass being produced. With this device, virtual reality games are made possible, just like in Sword Art Online (same creator). The story revolves around the protagonist, Haruyuki, who is given a game known as Brain Burst, which gives him the power to accelerate. <br />
<br />
The first half of Accel World basically introduces us and Haruyuki to the Accelerated World, allowing to understand how this game world works, the consequences surrounding it as well as the conflicts that exists in the game world. This was done well as everything about the game is not given in one sitting, blasting you repeatedly with confusing explanations, but rather, more of a show and tell, explaining the necessary details as they come by.<br />
<br />
The second half, I felt was done masterfully well. The antagonist (whose name I will not reveal) is truly a detestable person of extreme levels, throwing the characters into pits of darkness with almost no way out. This heavily puts the bonds of friendship among our main characters to the test. Will the bonds of friendship prevail, or will it fail? Sometimes when watching such incidents in anime, I like to think, if I were to put myself into their shoes, just what can I do to solve the problem? Is it even possible to solve this problem? The best part of Accel World is that I do not see any possible way out of the problem presented. I was legitimately feeling afraid for the characters, understanding their predicament. This is were I have to give props to the writers, for creating such a well thought out arc for allowing viewers to relate to the story itself.<br />
<br />
Overall, the story of Accel World however, is more than just people playing a game. It is more like the story of the human will. How a person’s will to break out of the status quo to change him, grow wings and soar to greater heights that he wants to achieve. Do you want to constantly stay un-contented with life, or do you want to do something about it? The power of the mind is limitless, as long as you believe you can.<br />
<br />
Characters (9/10)<br />
<br />
Despite popular belief, the characters in Accel World are actually really good. The most controversial character being Haruyuki, just because he’s chubby and fat. However, I think that it’s his looks that allow people to relate more to him. Because he’s fat and chubby, we can understand him even more. In real life, there’s always that one fat kid that’s being bullied. Obviously he’ll hate life and be sad about not being able to do anything. Basically, negative thoughts, thoughts about despair and weakness flowing through their minds. That’s why throughout Accel World, we can more noticeably see the change in Haruyuki’s character. From that weakling that cannot defend himself, to one that is full of confidence and positive thoughts. <br />
<br />
Kuroyukihime is portrayed as Haruyuki’s Senpai who can solve any problem, is knowledgeable and strong; basically she’s Haruyuki’s foil, the exact opposite of him. However, despite all of these positive traits mentioned, she’s made human, being given fear, regret and guilt. What makes this great is that as such, both Haruyuki and Kuroyukihime rely on each other, supplementing each other flaws and helping one another to reach greater heights.<br />
<br />
Takumu is also yet another well developed character since he’s totally different at the end of the series. <br />
<br />
Chiyu however, is kind of irritating throughout. She’s the kind of character that gets angry over everything, is fussy throughout. Moreover, her role in the second half gets more important which makes her all the more detestable. Of course, it was resolved in the final episode.<br />
<br />
As for the supporting characters, they are all pretty well developed as well, such as Sky Raker and Scarlet Rain. I’d rather not spoil so that you can enjoy the series to the fullest.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10)<br />
<br />
The beauty of the art can really be noticed in the accelerated world maps where everything is super detailed. The Unlimited Acceleration Field is where the art truly shines. They are well designed with plenty of detail.<br />
<br />
Not forgetting of course the fighting scenes, which are a joy to watch, especially the sparks when two blades clash with each other.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10)<br />
<br />
I started watching Accel World because I heard Altima’s song, Burst the Gravity. When I listened to the other openings and endings, being Chase the World, unfinished and Unite, I just can’t help but listen to them every episode, as much as I want to skip them to get to the episode. They are just so catchy.<br />
<br />
Accel World also uses plenty of soundtracks especially during the fight scenes. Each stage has a different soundtrack, and all matches really well. Somehow, the soundtrack reminds me of the soundtracks from the Pokemon games.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed Accel World. After every episode I would find myself wanting for more. Each and every episode is entertaining and is important in driving the story yet another step further.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
<br />
Accel World on the whole is an anime that provides an interesting story that focuses on games, human beliefs and the will to surpass them and friendship bonds. The characters are well fleshed out and developed. Both the art and soundtrack are beautiful to watch and listen to. <br />
<br />
Please note: If you’re planning on passing up on Accel World just because of how fat the main character looks, please, do yourself a favour and just watch it with an open mind. You might just find the hidden gem inside this awesome anime.<br />

    Accel World. Wow. <br />
<br />
Let me be honest here. I went into this Anime expecting it to be just the usual Shounen, Sci-Fi, Action, Garbage that&#039;s marketed toward teenage boys these days. And in a sense; it is. But it does so perfectly.<br />
<br />
In the sense of Story (so far that is) Accel World takes a basic plot premise and massively expands on it. I see no holes, I see no deus ex machina, I see no excuse for the writers to shove in an extra battle or character death or fanservice shot. Everything looks planned out, everything looks structured; it looks like Accel world is heading

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60847">
        in the exact direction it needs to go. <br />
<br />
In the terms of it&#039;s Genre and it&#039;s Target Audience; Accel World succeeds. It plays to it&#039;s strengths; it doesn&#039;t try to be original; and in the act, it ends up being so. I see Accel World as an example of what we could have got if Guilty Crown or Mirai Nikki weren&#039;t train-wrecks. <br />
<br />
Won&#039;t comment much more now; will leave room for the next few episodes.

    From my first time watching this anime, I thought this was for a moment .hack. I could say it is similar but different.  <br />

Accel World follows 	Arita, Haruyuki, a short fat boy who attends  a prestigious school. But his entire life he is bullied and so he despises his life(reality). He wished the world to be like a video game( Accel World). Accel World is some sort of MMO where your avatar can interact others and play all sort of mini games.

    Please keep in mind that I have been viewing only two episodes upon writing this review. As this is still my second written review, I will chose the simplest words and try to keep it short.<br />
<br />
Accel World, or Accelerated World. It&#039;s an imaginary world of accelerated thought process. In this imaginary world, the time moves 1/1000 faster than the real world. In other word, one second in the real world is 16 minutes 40 seconds in Accelerated World. Cool, huh?<br />
<br />
It has a great and modern concept, and aside from Accelerated World which is only accessible for some &#039;chosen&#039; persons, every area has a Global Link

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58663">
        or a server where everyone can access using a device. Just imagine your school turning into a big server, and each student will have an avatar representing themselves in that server.<br />
<br />
Still a little bit confused? Well I encourage you to try watching it, but allow me to finish my review beforehand.<br />
<br />
Story : 7<br />
Why seven? Because it has been only two episodes. It has great concept and great potential, but sadly it&#039;s not fully developed (yet). Many unanswered questions and many small details that yet have to be revealed (yet). In the future, I believe the story rating will go up as the story moves on.<br />
<br />
Art : 8<br />
I really liked the art, especially the character designs. Main protagonist are a little bit crappy, but that makes Accel World unique and different from another animes, as main protagonist doesn&#039;t need to always have an ideal posture. Kuroyukihime is one of my favorite main heroine in this Spring 2012, aside from Sanka Rea from Sankarea.<br />
<br />
Sound : 8<br />
I really liked May&#039;n - Chase the World, and the soundtracks blend pretty well into the atmosphere. Not much to say on this one, but I don&#039;t found this section troublesome at all.<br />
<br />
Character : 8<br />
As long as I watched animes, there are only a very little few animes that chose the protagonist to be a bullied student. Most of the protagonist is not also chubby, and Accel World offers a good pace of change. The protagonist is introvert, shy, childish, and unreliable. But slowly, good character development appears. Aside from that, the main heroine trait is a classic ojou-sama type and there&#039;s nothing too special about her (aside from her character design).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 8<br />
I watched this anime for the first two minutes and I&#039;m already HOOKED in it. This show is very enjoyable because it has a great concept and unique character backed up by good art and sound. I really can&#039;t wait the third episode, and I guarantee you this is one of the most enjoyable anime on Spring 2012 (second to Fate/Zero S2 in my ranking).<br />
<br />
Overall : 8<br />
Overall, this show is worth watching. And believe me, you won&#039;t be disappointed. Maybe you&#039;re a little bit confused about the anime concept upon watching it, but fear not as it would become clear as the show continues.<br />
<br />
I hope you found my review helpful.

    I&#039;m not hatin, I&#039;m just trying to say that this was not good.<br />
<br />
We watch anime for enjoyment, however, there wasn&#039;t much to enjoy about this anime. Rather, there are more things that irked me than things I liked.<br />
<br />
Like SAO, the series started off opening a gate of opportunities. A secret world exists where points you earn can be used in real life. But what the heck, let&#039;s just turn this to a harem anime instead.<br />
<br />
Where da hell did they come from?<br />
<br />
The one thing that really ticked me off was the main character, the fat guy. I see that they&#039;re trying to pull off a unique

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150129">
        character and make one that can&#039;t be judged by appearance, but he&#039;s just like any other harem lead that&#039;s as dense as hell, only ten times as ugly.<br />
<br />
The story wasn&#039;t very well thought out either. I mean c&#039;mon, 2nd season is ditto to the 2nd arc of sao. The same author used the same plot twice...<br />
<br />
The artwork had its nice touches. It was the only part you COULD enjoy about the anime, but all the battles start to get boring after overusing it. One Michael Bay is enough.<br />
<br />
On a final note, I think Accel World is a waste of potential. If you haven&#039;t watched it yet or you&#039;re looking for something to kill time with, then go to YouTube and search up puppies or something, it&#039;s more worth it.

    I had the pleasure of wasting my time on such a crap anime; Yipee!! So let me tell you why you should definitely waste your time watching this anime! <br />

The setting takes place in the future, 2046 where nothing is different from our current time except that there&#039;s a real life virtual game called Accel World, which slows down the speed in real life and the person&#039;s brain goes into an sped up imagination world. What&#039;s the point of the game? Level up and become the strongest.. I think. I honestly have no idea. Anyways, in this game it&#039;s sort of like Sword Art Online

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161479">
        except instead of the characters looking like their real life faces, they look like avatars (pig, fairies) and when they fight they become a robot (Dumb shit right here). <br />
<br />
First, the anime starts off with our fat, dumb, pathetic, cowardly, whiny, and virgin main character whose computer avatar is a fat pig. He gets bullied at school, and nobody likes him except conveniently the most popular girl at the school and the only reason why I even gave this show a 3: Kuroyukihime. Kuroyukihime loves our piggy main character and teaches him about Accel World, leading our heroic pig to join the game. There he gets beat up, loses to everyone, and vows to get strong enough to protect the ones he cares for. Unfortunately for him, he can&#039;t do crap and always has to hide behind Kuroyukihime. Sure there are plot twists here and there about who the &quot;villain&quot; in the anime is... But it always leads to absolutely nothing. But you know, good ol ecchi is included so for those of you perverted fans, give this robotic no plot version of Sword Art Online a shot!<br />
<br />
Accel goes into very deep concepts about the universe. Allow me to list all these genius stuff:<br />
<br />
- If you get bullied in real life, run into a game and TRY to level up! That fixes everything!<br />
<br />
- If there&#039;s a love triangle going on with your best friends, try to keep it going for as long as possible, it will fix everything in life. <br />
<br />
- There is only one solution to isolation in real life: make friends online!<br />
<br />
- If a popular girl loves you, then try to protect her and lose consistently! According to Accel World, that makes you more charming. Also to make a beautiful girl love you, just get fatter and fatter and whine to her about the 10000 problems you have.<br />
<br />
- Most importantly, remember that in the sense of the deep universe that we live in, virtual games decide our fate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Truly a masterpiece, I recommend it to all the people out there that want to waste their time!

    Okay, this show is one of my greatest personal enigmas. I know that in lots of ways, it&#039;s awful. It&#039;s clichéd, it&#039;s overdone, it feels like every other battle anime/manga out there.<br />
<br />
But for some reason I can&#039;t stop watching it.<br />
<br />
Okay, it&#039;s not as bad as all that, at least it&#039;s a little original, and the superpowers are actually all within a computer game, and it does actually matter in real life for once, which is one of the greatest failings of this type of show. It manages to make itself at least credible, if we make allowances for virtually impossible feats of sci-fi. But that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71109">
        all seems to be part of the fun.<br />
<br />
One of the things I find intensely annoying about the show is the fact that all the main characters are pretty standard templates, from the wuss of a main character who actually acquires some courage to the girlfriend with a dark past and the latest story arc&#039;s &#039;for teh evilz&#039; villain. It drags the show down, given that it&#039;s main attraction is the awesome fight scenes (which are nicely done most of the time), and having people shout heartfelt but cliché nonsense over the top gets irritating quickly.<br />
<br />
Overall the show is not a terrible way to waste 25 minutes every week, but it still leaves me wondering why I watch it. I do enjoy it a fair bit, but I still can&#039;t say why, and I doubt it will leave a great lasting impression on me, unless the last few episodes are beyond awesome.

    Ok, so the 24 episode anime has ended, so how do I find it? Well, I say that the anime&#039;s genre, sci-fi, school, action, romance and cyberpunk are all well balanced of the make of this anime. However more emphasis is on the sci-fi, action and cyberpunk genre, since everything revolves around it, the romance and school were merely additives for the anime&#039;s entertainment. I can&#039;t say that I totally enjoy this anime, but I also can&#039;t say that I find this anime boring, co&#039;z to me it is something interesting but not in a level where I would like it totally, so how do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73055">
        I rate this anime???????Here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
The story is more on the plot which is too simple. It is a loser dude meeting a mysterious cool chick and mysterious cool chick feels pity for the loser dude and helps him out by introducing him into a different world and as always  loser dude did good in that world, and there is this mysterious hot chick developing feelings for the loser dude. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: Good 7.<br />
<br />
It is pretty obvious that studio Sunrise has put a lot of effort into the art, the way the main protagonist the chiquito pureco (it means little piggy boy in Spanish) Haruyuk was drawn really epitomizes your typical loser boy and the way Hime was drawn, her avatar really gives that impression of an elegant mysterious cool chick with something to hide.<br />
<br />
Sound: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say that both opening and ending themes are ok. No need for me to say anything else.<br />
<br />
Characters: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
The thing about them characters is most of them started with the usual enemy turned allies as in the case of Takumu and Yuniko, but there is this very unique thing where Chiyu turned enemy when she sided with Noumi in ep. 19 and then returns to her usual side co&#039;z she only use Noumi to gain points in order to activate her avatar&#039;s special ability to help the Chiquito Pureco (Haruyuki). I would have given this part a higher point, but then again the main protagonist - I&#039;m referring to the Chiquito Pureco, Haruyuki pisses me off because of his stupidity and his incisiveness where it looks like that his charcter can&#039;t hold it&#039;s own without Hime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Well, have you ever watch someone who is playing games be it console or on- line, where you enjoy most by watching them players than you  playing the game yourself? Well, it is like that, in fact watching this anime is just like a being a backseat player, in fact the cyberpunk genre is the enjoyment of this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
The thing about this anime is that it focuses on a person&#039;s escape from reality,  where a person cannot accept the way reality is so he goes to some fantasy land knowing that there he/she is somebody, in this anime&#039;s case that fantasy is the augmented reality of &quot;Accel World&quot; where people who can&#039;t stand the reality of the real world go to in order to become someone else. As much as I hate to say it, this anime conveys that kind  of suggestion. Though, this anime for me is interesting enough for me to follow through, I really don&#039;t like the idea of people confining themselves in such alternate reality, so overall my thoughts about this anime is split between liking it and being disgusted by it. So  such rating would be enough for the overall of this anime, BURST LINK!!!!       <br />

    I have never been a huge fan of Virtual reality games.. Really, the concept of &quot;levelling up&quot; or just numbers on a server never appealed to me. This concept is oddly baffling since thousands and even millions of people spend every second of their life stuck to their computer screens  and never adding anything to their personality or Real life. VR are currently limited to MMORG which has potential to grow into a world to rival the real world raising psychological and societal concerns. Though I steered clear of VR anime until now, but after watching accel world I realised something important,  What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105013">
        if some people are only good in VR worlds??...<br />
Accel World is just another VR world where people who have a program called “Burst Link” installed can join and battle it out with their Avatars. The protagonist  Haruyuki is your average student but with the fact that hes short , fat and unpopular, hes bullied and picked on by his seniors . He also gets the distant impression that his only 2 friends pity him in his condition.  So, he closes himself in his VR world and plays the only thing he’s good at which is VR tennis. Enter  kuryokihime , the hottest chick in the school and the one who possesses brain burst, she is unable to beat haruyuki’s  tennis score and had to resort to “cheating” to beat his score. She realises that haru is the only one who can help accomplish her dream in the Accel and subsequently starts liking him….<br />
Supporting Characters:<br />
The one thing good about this anime was that the role of the supporting characters was just as good as the main character. These include Haru’s childhood friend’s Chiyuri  and takumu both of whom help him in the accel world. Be it ash roller or “sky raker” kurasaki , everyone was responisible for Haayuki’s character development both inside and outside Accelerated world.<br />
<br />
Main Character:<br />
The main character Harayuki-kun is a badass  in the VR world while his alter ego in the real world is completely the opposite. The one thing I liked about Haru and its something even other viewers will also like is his tenacity and the will to never give up. It doesn’t matter whether he facing a Fortified tank which can fire 100 missiles per second topped with 2 cannons or a guy who has a large number of abilities to choose from, etc, Haru never gives up. He tries till the very end even “bursting” through his own limits  to emerge the victor of the day.  Another thing  was that most of the time Haru won was because he used his brain and thought of a plan instead of the usual story where the protagonist gains some new power or so.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack and animation:<br />
Animation is really top-notch and way superior than many anime already out there. The soundtrack is quite amazing as well which includes Accel world’s battle theme, “burst the gravity”,  “-unfinished-&gt;”  . Some of the battle scenes are spectacular  and really done well. The art is also of a high calibre.<br />
Thing Lacking:<br />
The only thing I thought that was lacking about Accel world was the absence of a main antagonist.  I do know that kuryokihime wanted to accomplish her dream (no spoilers revealed) but the “atagonists” in season 1 were somewhat lacking. Don’t get me wrong,  one of the antagonist Seije Nomi is a complete douchebag and guy you would like to kill over and over again XD but I felt as if season one was more about Haru and his pals disciplined some school kids who were misusing accel world including takumu. So it was more about what Accel world,  how to use it and what to use it for…<br />
That’s it for my review, I HOPE you guys enjoyed, This was my FIRST EVER , so plz drop me comment on my profile if you liked or even if you didn’t like it, just let me know ^_^… Also, I don’t rate my anime (plz read my profile)..<br />
 But I would like to say that Accel World is a must watch Anime.<br />
<br />
(MINOR SPOILER: <br />
<br />
There is small “something” (try and spot in the anime) that connects Sword Art Online and Accel world. Also there are rumours that the daughter of kirito and Asuna is actually kuryokihime. Although the Author has denied any connection between SAO and Accel world but they were hinting on a joint season between the two in the near episode… )<br />

    -Welcome to my Accelerated Accel World review! I hope you enjoy reading it.-<br />
<br />
Story-10<br />
<br />
The story of Accel World revolves around Cartman from South Park, who used JohnTitor2036&#039;s time machine (Refer to the first Steins;Gate review) to get to Japan in 2046. In the process, Cartman lost his memories and is accustomed to his new life in future Japan. As expected from his quick learning with foreign languages, he has mastered Japanese. Also, as expected from the Pimpmaster Cartman, In Japan, he managed to score himself 2 hot babes named Kuroyukihime and Chiyuri (who even already has a boyfriend named Taku), who are madly in love with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59339">
        him and hunger for his Burrito.<br />
<br />
In future Japan, he was bullied by his Senpai upperclassmen, so he found himself often escaping to the world of futuristic virtual reality video games which he is a Pro in them (Again, as expected from Cartman).<br />
<br />
From what I&#039;m describing here you can already tell that Accel World is the anime masterpiece of the decade. It has Cartman in a futuristic setting, it has hot babes and virtual reality video games. What more can you ask for? Yeah... boobs, I know.<br />
<br />
The romance in Accel World is extremely well developed. Cartman has fan catering harems who make the viewer envy his position. He&#039;s damn lucky. I want to be Cartman.<br />
<br />
Accel World&#039;s story is a clash of Pros in futuristic virtual reality video games that are aiming to be the best of the best. It&#039;s an epic that rivals to none in the Sci-Fi genre.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation-10<br />
<br />
Cartman is drawn even better than in South Park. The Art is simply stunning and the animation doesn&#039;t have a tiny bit of Quality which we witness alot in anime these days. The team behind the animation is Sunrise who is known for producing eye candy animated shows who make the viewer drool from the hot drawn babes in it. If you want to get a boner, this is the anime for you.<br />
<br />
Sound-10<br />
<br />
In the Japanese dub, Cartman is voiced by that guy from Guilty Crown and the voice fits him perfectly.<br />
Babe number 1 Kuroyukihime is voiced by a new talent named Misawa Sachika and her voice is so erotic I can&#039;t help but to imagine her saying nasty stuff to me.<br />
Babe number 2 Chiyuri is voiced by that girl from K-ON and her voice fits her extremely well.<br />
Babe number 2&#039;s boyfriend is voiced by that guy from Tatami Galaxy and his voice is described well in one word: &#039;COOLU&#039;.<br />
<br />
Character-10<br />
<br />
Cartman. Hot babes. A guy with a &#039;COOLU&#039; voice. The characters are the best ever indeed in any anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed South Park you would love this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall-10<br />
<br />
I recommend Accel World to anyone that wants to enjoy the best story ever, and to devoted fans of South Park. Enjoy!<br />
<br />

     Accel world seems to be the kind of anime that you either love or hate.I essentially don&#039;t think there are too many things about it that you can hate.<br />
<br />
 Let&#039;s start with the story:<br />
This is a quite simple topic , a chubby boy who always gets bullied suddenly gets approached by one of the most popular girls in school.She sends him a game called burst linker , and that&#039;s where the story begins to shine with Haru trying his best to become stronger.<br />
<br />
 Characters:<br />
Well , this is where some people might have problem cause the main character , Haru ,  is a chubby

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81958">
        guy and he is also very small , but despite all that he seems to have girls that are very close to him.But despite his looks i think he has one of the best developments possible.From hopeless and unconfident he goes to courageous and outgoing.And then we have Koroyoukihime , the girl who sends him the game.She seems perfect at first , but she still is a human so she has her own problems.And then we have his two childhood friends , Chiyuri , a cute innocent girl who grows a lot during this series and Takumu , a guy who changes his attitude a lot during this series.Overall , the characters are pretty likeable.<br />
<br />
 Sound and Art:<br />
I have no complaints here , the art was pretty good and the sound was perfect for the fight scenes and even for the random scenes.<br />
<br />
 Overall:<br />
I think this is a pretty good anime with both action and a little romance.This is definetely a great watch.

    A spectacular anime first time Made by Sunrise single handedly(Helped produce Code Geass).Everything was pretty good although I was actually quite shocked that they lack in their creativity of art. Apparently I just didn&#039;t like the fact that the main protagonist is so chubby &amp; small which makes me want to mock him. Maybe that was added as a joke? The funniest part was that his avatar is a pig which just happened to knock me out cold. The story starts out pretty average(cliche). Its like this person has special powers &amp; he&#039;s an utter dork but the hottest girl in the entire school wants

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57769">
        to talk to you. You join up with that girl &amp; battle evil. That&#039;s not exactly what happens but it runs somewhere along the same lines(No creativity there). Although I think the characters are developed pretty well &amp; they tend to have there own unique personality which is considerably notable. I happen to be a lover of games &amp; anime. What makes this anime particularly attractive is the very fact that it revolves around the so called &quot;Virtual World&quot; where there are NPC&#039;s &amp; humans(MMORPG). I don&#039;t really have much to say since I only saw the first 2 episodes &amp; that really isn&#039;t enough to analyse the anime &amp; give a good review. But I&#039;d saw the art is really cliche &amp; the idea of a really fat &amp; chubby protagonist isn&#039;t really a funny joke &amp; also the fact that his transformation (Dual Avatar) is a copy of iron-man in silver. This anime is a must try from my perspective. The First 2 episodes came out on the same &amp; there really interesting. What attracts me to this anime is how the story is elegantly made. Disregarding the chubby protagonist who thinks he&#039;s a knight in shining armor which he is. <br />
Good Points:<br />
-Great Anime<br />
-Quite Amusing to watch &amp; ponder<br />
-The Queen is rather appealing<br />
-Not many animes with this type of genres<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-The Main Protagonist is just to Fat<br />
-The Anime story is very common but kind of varies in some ways<br />
-Allot of copies like bike from (ghost rider), Dual Avatar from (Iron Man)<br />
<br />
Overall: Disregarding all the cons I&#039;ve said I personally think this anime has allot of potential &amp; I&#039;m most likely sure that you shall be appeased
