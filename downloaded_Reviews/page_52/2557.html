    I decided to watch Zero no Tsukaima because I wanted a leave-your-brain-out-of-the-equation sort of show, one I could sit back and watch without worrying about a negative outcome or depressing and/or disturbing complications. (Yes, for all my talk about artistic integrity and such, I do watch things for pure and simple fun sometimes.) Zero has most of that, but only to a point, and in the end I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of depth this show manages to pull out of nowhere. I went in expecting another Nanoha, or the first season of Shakugan no Shana all over again, and what I got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4040">
        was something more akin to the comedic romance and character development of Love Hina supported and sustained by the political intrigue of Last Exile or Simoun.<br />
<br />
Plot: An incompetent mage summons as her familiar a young man from contemporary Japan, and hilarity ensues. It isn&#039;t quite as simple as that, however. Despite an early focus on slapstick comedy, ecchi, and outright silliness, Zero quickly introduces a thin political thread, providing bits and pieces of flavor to make the world seem more alive. This thread smoothly escalates into a significant driving force of the show&#039;s events, perhaps more powerful, even, than the central romance.<br />
<br />
And speaking of that central romance, it moves along at a nice pace -- neither too slowly nor too quickly for a 13-episode series. Exactly how it develops is for you to discover, but rest assured that it does not remain stagnant for long periods of time, at least in this season, as in Shakugan no Shana and its sequel.<br />
<br />
Characters: The cute, borderline-sadist lead; the busty, libidinous rival; the surprisingly forthright maid; the bookish, quiet Nagato Yuki clone -- these may seem like stock characters pulled from the harem romance pool, and they certainly begin as such. As in Love Hina, however, we discover that these characters have histories and unforeseen connections, sometimes in far darker ways than I expected of this show. What&#039;s more, many of these characters actually change over time, as characters in a story should. Sure, the cast seems a bit crazy at first, but give them a chance. It&#039;s worth it.<br />
<br />
And the male lead. Oh, the male lead. Saito&#039;s personality is what makes him simultaneously hilarious and divergent from the usual harem romance/datesim beta-male loser. We get the impression that he checks out every girl who crosses his path not because he&#039;s hopelessly desperate, but because he&#039;s a healthy teenage boy. Not that he&#039;s relegated to the role of lecher; he has his human and hero moments, too.<br />
<br />
Setting: Our story begins in your average Harry Potter-inspired magic school, complete with magic wands and quirky professors, but soon expands outward to encompass an alternate-history, magically-endowed Europe plagued by the class politics of magocracy -- that is, magi over non-magi. Though the central country of the show is fictional (apparently located roughly in the Aquitaine region of France), several real-world European powers have fantastical equivalents, often bearing the Latin names of the modern countries they mirror: Gallia is France, for example, and Germania is Germany. This becomes clear when we see a map of the fictional land. This world maintains interesting links to our Earth, but I&#039;ll leave it at that for fear of dropping spoilers. It&#039;s ultimately a surprisingly cohesive fantasy setting, and one to which I wouldn&#039;t mind returning.<br />
<br />
Art: Zero&#039;s art is reminiscent of Shakugan no Shana, also produced by J. C. Staff, and to a lesser extent Pani Poni Dash. It&#039;s a style that grew on me when I watched Shana. If you&#039;re a fan of more realistic art in your animation, however, be warned that you won&#039;t find it here.<br />
<br />
Sound: Despite being largely digital, Zero&#039;s music never quite descends into full-on cheesiness, as Shana&#039;s music did at times, nor does it overwhelm you with anachronistic elements unsuited to the vaguely Renaissance-inspired fantasy setting. The opening theme is quite catchy, for a reason I can&#039;t place, and as a fan of Kugimiya Rie and Hino Satoshi, I have trouble finding serious fault in the voice-acting.<br />
<br />
Verdict: I didn&#039;t think Zero no Tsukaima would end up being the kind of show I&#039;d be quick to recommend, but, to my pleasant surprise, it did. If you&#039;re looking for a tale of politics and romantic comedy, and don&#039;t mind that the ride isn&#039;t entirely serious from beginning to end, give this one a shot.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Do you like Moe? Do you like S&amp;M? Do you like obnoxious female leads? Boy do I have a series for you!<br />
<br />
Plot: 3/10 <br />
<br />
Familiar of Zero is an anime about an ordinary boy named Saito that is forced to be a magical slave to an obnoxious twat that summoned him from Japan to the far away land of extremely generic fantasy Europe. Here he must learn to adapt to his odd new life and learn about the various types of magic users. I am not going to go really in depth with the plot honestly. It soon becomes a very generic harem show and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175415">
        plot is NOT going to blow you away. Here is a summary of the plot: Louise the witch treats Saito like crap, the abuse is played up for cheap laughs, Saito uses his magic sword wielding ability to do something heroic, he still gets treated like crap. rinse and repeat. <br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
The main male character Saito is exceedingly bland and Louise is the least likeable female lead I have seen in a long time! There are also plenty of supporting characters, but there really wasn&#039;t anyone I liked in this series. Usually I can find a couple characters I like in even the most mediocre anime, but here I got nothing.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
<br />
The art is pretty good since this anime had a decent budget. It was based on a successful light novel that I can only assume was somehow better than the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10 if you aren&#039;t a masochist, 7/10 if you are.<br />
<br />
Remember in early 2014 when Japanese men were drooling over the uniformed hottie Natalia Poklanskaya and some Japanese youtube poster stated: &quot;I want her to yell at me and step on me&quot;? That is this entire fucking series in a nutshell. It is a fantasy for Japanese teen masochists who want to be dominated by hot European women. I&#039;m not a masochist, and I don&#039;t see white girls as an exotic fetish, so I really didn&#039;t find anything to like in this series besides a few decent slapstick moments. The comedy sort of works in a few places, but mostly it is just obnoxious.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
<br />
I have met people (including one of my best friends) that thought this series was a comedic masterpiece. I REALLY don&#039;t agree with that assessment, but the series at least does some things right. The art is decent, the music is decent, the voice acting is fine. However, I felt that overall this was a very mediocre series that I wouldn&#039;t recommend to anyone...unless once again you are in fact a male masochist.

    This is my second review of an anime series.  Please spare me. xD;<br />
I don&#039;t do many reviews on shows but I would like to review on this one. Since this series touched me a lot and its my childhood. :P<br />
<br />
One of the series that expanded my variety of anime after Inuyasha and Shana.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
You have Louise, your mage that possess terrible magic and a boy that came from another world. He has to deal with the customs in Louise&#039;s world and has to face many obstacles; and with war, I&#039;m not gonna spoil. Or I will try not too.<br />
This series is a comedy, so it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93787">
        does have some harem/ecchi involvement. Though, I think this series would be better off without the ecchi and the harem. That way, the characters have room to develop.<br />
<br />
So I would give the story an 8/10.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art is very beautiful to look at. I love the character designs of the show; which made me want to continue to watch it. The fighting scenes was well done; with the graphics. I wish more anime would have art like this; and the art also reminded me of Shakugan no Shana. With Saito resembling Yuuji. :P&quot;<br />
<br />
So yes, 10/10  for the art. 8D<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Some of the music in the anime was really pretty, I liked how it worked well with the show. But I could NOT stand the ending themes. The opening themes were more--enjoyable. But I liked the second seasons opening the best overall; so the sound I would give<br />
<br />
7/10.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters could use a little bit more development in the show. Like everyone else has said; I think Louise should START to trust Saito more instead of beating the poor guy senseless; and Saito should try to control himself more around the women. But then again, he&#039;s a 17 year old boy and pretty much the only guy other then Guiche. But what disappointed me, some of the characters you don&#039;t get to know about. And they&#039;re just there.<br />
<br />
Like Siesta, Kirche, Guiche, Montomorency. I probably spelled her name wrong, so shoot me.  Lot of characters like those are so undeveloped, it makes me a bit sad that you never know anything about them. The only real characters that are actually developed are Tabitha, Julio, and Agnes.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not saying that Saito is undeveloped since he does get stronger within the series and doesn&#039;t remain, &quot;weak,&quot; throughout. I just wish they would give more bio on Saito; like his past. Etc. But what puzzles me, I remember him in the first season saying he does not have a family. So that makes me wonder about him more.<br />
<br />
<br />
But overall, the characters COULD use some improvement.<br />
To make a better series.<br />
<br />
So I give a characters a <br />
<br />
6/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
The series kept me watching until the very end. So despite the negative things about the show; it still made me want to keep on watching more and was sad about the end of the series. The season I liked the best was the second and the fourth season. Since characters started to develop more then; but you still wish to know about them. :P<br />
<br />
So Enjoyment overall in Zero no Tsukaima.<br />
<br />
8/10.

    Zero no Tsukaima-- The Familiar of Zero. With a badass name like that, what could go wrong? Awesome action with a really nice romance subplot, now that&#039;s what I like in anime. Which isn&#039;t what Zero no Tsukaima has. At. All.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
To sum up the entire plot in Zero no Tsukaima in one sentence, it would be, &quot;I feel like it&#039;d be a lot better if I was nine.&quot; Me, personally, I&#039;m an over analytical prick who over thinks every little thing. But I feel like someone with the IQ of a potato would still find the plot holes in this swiss cheese. To start

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190570">
        off, I&#039;ll list the pros. Just a little side note, I had to actually keep a notepad file open when watching this incase there was any little thing I liked in this show, because, believe me, I wanted to like it. <br />
-The beginning of episode seven [Minor Spoiler: Saito is rewarded with a kiss from the princess and he does it too romantically and she passes out. Don&#039;t know why, I just thought it was funny.]<br />
-The end of episode eleven [Major Spoiler: Not gonna say anything, but it was really satisfying after how bitchy Louise is to Saito.]<br />
-The Ending Scene<br />
That&#039;s it. I kept a f**king list open the entire time. Alright, well, not going to turn into a rant, but, the main problem with the plot is that it&#039;s super predictable. You see everything coming a mile away. It&#039;s really generic, as well. However, the biggest, worst by far, always-there problem is that everything is too rushed. Way, way too rushed.<br />
<br />
Art: 4<br />
Meh.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
Don&#039;t even get me started on the royalty free sound effects that were used in the final episode. The budget on this show was shit, to say the least, but the fact that they waited to spend the rest of their budget on the final episode, which was, as usual, too rushed and no build up. OP was decent. Yes, I do realize that being royalty free, they didn&#039;t cost money, and I made the point about the budget earlier, but I&#039;ll get more into it later.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
Wow. I was just blown away by how generic and uninteresting every character was. The tsundere, Louise, isn&#039;t a tsundere. You see, with a tsundere character archtype, you have to have the character show affection towards another character after time. Does Zero no Tsukaima do this? *The rest of the character section is a spoiler* Yes, and it was very satisfying, to say the least. It was the filler episode, or at least I thought it was filler, episode six, or something like that. Louise drank a love potion by accident, and then grew really affectionate to our super generic and uninteresting protagonist, Saito. One of the characters who never appears after this episode said that it would last a year or so, so I thought it&#039;d be until the end of the show, or at least the season. Needless to say, I was glad it happened. No more masochistic humor or fanservice (sometimes I&#039;m not even sure), and finally a good female protagonist. Clingy, but cute. It all ends. And not on the final episode, the end of that episode, and very abruptly, I might add.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
You know, for all the things this show completely and utterly fails at, there is a few good things. For example, if you were a masochist, the five would probably be higher. The very few, and I think there was about three total scenes of actual action in this entire season, were average. The budget was very lightly spent, and it was very clear to see that, and then the remaining budget at the end was spent entirely on the final episode, as I said above, which was cool, I guess. But it was cruel, too. Maybe the other episodes could have been good, like the royalty free sound effects in the opening of the final episode, but no. Not even close. The second thing I wanted to address in this is the transitions. That little wand that flips across the screen and that stupid royalty free sound effect plays. You&#039;ll hear it so many times. So many. The third thing is that the opening&#039;s lyrics make it seem like the show will be romance intensive, which isn&#039;t a bad thing by any means, but it&#039;s quite the opposite. It&#039;s probably, in order from most in the show to least in the show, unfunny generic comedy, decent action, masochistic fanservice, romance. It&#039;s just bad. At some places, it&#039;s so bad it&#039;s actually kinda good. But that&#039;s as far as it gets.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
It was quite bad. Upon watching this, go in with low expectations and leave with lower ones. Seriously, it&#039;s bad. Just go watch something else. Anything else. Seriously. Please. I wish this show was good. I wish I wish I wish. But it&#039;s terrible. I&#039;m actually sad to have had so high expectations for this show but instead was so drastically disappointed. Bottom line: This show is shit. Shit with a few sparkles, but none the less, shit.

    I can&amp;rsquo;t say I liked Zero no Tsukaima as much as hormonal, pre-teen male otaku out there. <br />
<br />
Plot-wise, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s a revamped version of Maburaho. Other than being produced by JC Staff, the two series have other things in common. First off there&amp;rsquo;s the setting &amp;ndash; both series are set in a magic school. There&amp;rsquo;s also the harem anime aspect &amp;ndash; Louise, Siesta (my favorite!) and Kirche are all fighting over the token loser male character, Saito. Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s the ecchi. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing that the ecchi in Zero no Tsukaima isn&amp;rsquo;t as heavy as Maburaho&amp;rsquo;s.<br />
<br />
It was a stable ride for me during

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397">
        the whole series. There were no high points and low points. Let me reinforce my first point by saying that if I were a guy I would probably like Zero no Tsukaima more. Louise&amp;rsquo;s tsundere antics would probably captivate me, and Kirche&amp;rsquo;s presence would probably get my temperature rising, but that will probably never happen. As for Saito, he didn&amp;rsquo;t really catch my attention. I did love watching his fight scenes but when he&amp;rsquo;s not fighting, he&amp;rsquo;s quite bland. Tabitha is too reminiscent of Yuki Nagato for me, but she&amp;rsquo;s not as cool.<br />
<br />
As expected of JC Staff, the animation was good enough to satisfy me. Everything was very cutesy though &amp;ndash; from Louise&amp;rsquo;s pink hair (as well as the bevy of pastel color schemes throughout the series) to the Pokemon-ish familiars (except Saito, of course). The CG was lukewarm, and it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing they used CG minimally.<br />
<br />
Apparently most of the voice actors of Zero no Tsukaima also worked in Shakugan no Shana. The most notable name would be Rie Kugimiya, Louise&amp;rsquo;s seiyuu, who is known as a tsundere seiyuu. She was Shana in Shakugan no Shana. There&amp;rsquo;s also Satoshi Hino, Saito&amp;rsquo;s seiyuu, who was Sakai Yuuji in Shakugan no Shana. Other name worthy of mentioning is the very well known Yui Horie, Siesta&amp;rsquo;s seiyuu and Takahiro Sakurai, Guiche&amp;rsquo;s seiyuu.<br />
<br />
I like the music too. The opening and ending themes were both j-pop-ish, which can be a good thing. Both songs were very cutesy and catchy, and I liked both. As for the BGM, I&amp;rsquo;d say they were decent tracks. The BGM was fitting to the mood and feel of the series, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s THAT good.<br />
<br />
While I wasn&amp;rsquo;t that pleased with it, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad after all. It started and ended on the same note and consistency is a good thing for me. I might watch the second season just to see if I&amp;rsquo;ll like it more.

Zero no Tsukaima takes place in an alternate world where magic and dragons exist. The majority of the story takes place at a magical academy where students train to become successful mages. Everybody has their own specialty whether it be earth magic or water. Enter Louise de long name not worth typing out. Louise is a high strung and cocky mage wannabe who can&#039;t do much of anything right. Every spell she attempts to cast seems to fail miserably and just blow things up. During the ceremony to summon what is to be your familiar forever more, she ends up summoning a boy by the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7177">
        name of Saito who comes from our world; more particularly Japan. So while everybody else has salamanders, moles, frogs and other creatures, Louise has a boy. <br />
<br />
The story progression is all about the relationship that builds between Louise and Saito. She treats him like a familiar, or to be more precise like a slave pet. He has to wash her clothes, do her menial chores and even sleeps on the floor. Throughout the show their relationship begins to develop more and small plot twists are slowly introduced. Why the boy is special. Why Louise just seems to mess everything up. <br />
<br />
The overall story in ZnT is nothing that hasn&#039;t been done before. I don&#039;t like to grade based on precedence though as it is not fair to the subject matter. Louise and Saito slowly come together to make a good team and other characters are introduced that turn the show into &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot; just with spell casting. It does get quite serious towards the latter part of the series, and I would say that it was actually pulled off quite nicely. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
As I said in my opening paragraph, the initial thing that even got me to watch this show was Louise. I do hate to admit but I thought she was hot. I completely understand if you hit that back button right now. Even after the show is done, I still do. Remember, the back button is at the top left of your browser window, or you can just hit backspace. Anyway, the characters are all quite attractive in their actual originality. It does have the whole JC Staff production feel to it in the character design, but they are all nicely done. Although if you have a problem with the male in anime always looking like an average guy, you&#039;ll likely not like Saito&#039;s overall design. But if you enjoy big eyed cute girls, lolis, big breasted fiery red heads; then this show is gonna make you have a nerdgasm. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the background animations are all paid attention to. Usually in shows like this, all the detail goes into character development and the background is left to die in a dark corner. Thankfully this wasn&#039;t the case with ZnT. Another thing that caught me by surprise is that they managed to throw in some obvious CG scenes without them standing out too much or just ruining the whole animation feel. When many shows throw CG into the mix, they make it stick out and just look awful, almost to say &amp;quot;check out what we can do.&amp;quot; ZnT does a wonderful job of balancing it out and pulls off a solid animation effort in the end.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The first things that should always been addressed in the sound department is the opening and closing songs. Dead on! The opening is &amp;quot;First Kiss&amp;quot; by Ichiko and couldn&#039;t be more fitting for the tone of the show. The lyrics make much more sense than many Japanese songs tend to, and quite frankly it&#039;s catchy. Definitely recommended for the playlists out there. The background was fitting, which is really all you can ask from anime. The music played always fit the situation and there were a few that stuck out and were able to do a masterful job of getting the viewer into the emotional situation. Playful music was the main course for the show as it tends to be much more humorous and whimsical than anything. But when it got serious, the music did a great job of presenting that to the viewer. <br />
<br />
The voice acting was actually quite phenomenal. Every character fit their personalities well. Even though I can&#039;t stand the overly effeminate characters in anime, at least he was voiced well. Louise had the very defiant, cocky and sometimes very vulnerable feel to here. I thought of her kind of as I did Naru from Love Hina. Except not so much of a b*tch (God I hate Naru). Saito was considerably better than many main male characters usually are. For once in anime, the guy wasn&#039;t represented by a complete and total nerd. He was actually a strong, intelligent and thoughtful guy. He had his moments, but overall when he talked, he kinda made me proud for us; for once. But the voice acting award has to go Nanako Inoue as Kirche. Kirche was the virtual arch-rival of Louise. She was one of the good ones at magic and made a point to rub it in the face of Louise as much as she could. Her character was given the voice of condescending know-it-all. She was also the school flirt, a serious mage and a seductress. Japanese women can be sexy, but their voices rarely scream sexual seduction. She manages to seduces the viewer, male viewer, quite nicely. That&#039;s an accomplishment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Presentation<br />
At the end of the day, ZnT is a short anime that is just entertaining. It doesn&#039;t provide a terribly deep plot. Many of the tools used in this show have been used many times before. The characters can be considered somewhat cliche. But that may be one of its charms. It doesn&#039;t make you think outside of your anime paradigm. It just allows you to sit down and enjoy the hijinks and life of some crazy characters. I can say that I just couldn&#039;t stop watching it once I started; it is one of those shows that just makes time fly so much faster. <br />
<br />
If you have had your fill of &amp;quot;guy can&#039;t admit to girl, girl can&#039;t admit to guy&amp;quot;, girl hit guy for no reason or anything like that, you may want to steer clear from watching Zero no Tsukaima. Everybody else will pull something out of it in end that they will enjoy. I guarantee it. <br />

    This one&#039;s gonna hurt, folks. My lowest review yet, but you should expect that from a series that capitalizes entirely on cliches without an ounce of originality or effort in any single field. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Zero no Tsukaima.<br />
<br />
Getting the technical bits out of the way, Zero no Tsukaima was average in audio and visual. No memorable BGM, forgettable OP, and an irritating ED, but the performances were rather pleasing in some cases. Rie Kugimiya plays the standard tsundere role well, but shines better in scenes where she&#039;s interacting with someone that isn&#039;t Saito, where her other sides become more apparent, such

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13979">
        as when she is with Henrietta. Unfortunately this doesn&#039;t happen often so it&#039;s mainly tsundere all the way. If you&#039;re into that, you&#039;re in luck. The rest of us aren&#039;t. Yui Horie and Ayako Kawasumi also turn in some decent though generic performances as Siesta and Henrietta respectively.<br />
<br />
Visual is just inconsistent. The character designs are very simplistic and basic with not much detail or imagination. While its very average most of the time, it becomes incredibly fluid at the oddest moments, such as a scene early on where Louise chases Saito around in front of Henrietta, or again where Saito fights Ward. Because the animation is so generic the majority of the series, these random bits of fluidity are suprisingly pleasing, but give a lasting impression that the series has been half-assing it.<br />
<br />
Indeed the series did half-ass it, and what better proof do you need than the characters? Rie Kugimiya typecast aside, mostly because it did work here, these characters border from stereotypical archetypes like Kirche to downright ripoffs like Tabitha, who is completely stealing from Yuki Nagato from her hobbies to the exact way she talks. It&#039;s like they told the seiyuu &quot;okay, now for this character, sound EXACTLY like Yuki Nagato from Haruhi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet the biggest offender by far is Saito, one of the most irritating Mary Sues of a harem hero I&#039;ve ever come across. Not only does he manage to attract nearly every girl to him even though he does nothing for half the series, but the plot decided to give him the ability to defeat anyone he faces, and the one time he does lose, he goes off and sulks about it as if he thinks it&#039;s his god-given right to defeat everyone.<br />
<br />
I mean, look... you have a fantasy world with magic and swords and dragons, so some special powers are to be expected, but the series actually gives Saito full deus ex machina capabilities by the end. It&#039;s disgusting how much this show gives him just so he can keep winning. The world of magic itself is no better. For a story relying a good deal on magic, the foundation of magic in this series is terribly simple. I will admit the cross-cultural &quot;magical artifacts&quot; were slightly amusing but even that grew tiresome.<br />
<br />
The setting&#039;s relation aside, this series just doesn&#039;t know what it wants to do. It starts as a romantic comedy, then quickly shifts to a magical adventure without so much as a single notice. I also give no positive marks to a series that sets up a possible arc, then ends it after one episode with no resolution or purpose other than to show Louise in a bustier. Note that Louise in a bustier had nothing to do with the setup.<br />
<br />
The best reason I can give for why this series was green-lit back in 2006 would be the boom of anime adapted from light novels and the birth of tsundere fandom, and it shows. There&#039;s so bad it&#039;s good and there&#039;s so bad I want to see just how bad it can get. Zero no Tsukaima is just bad. It&#039;s littered with cliches that have been run into the ground for years before this show, and the only new gag it can conjure up (horsewhip) just isn&#039;t funny no matter how much the series pushes them. Though Rie Kugimiya gives a solid performance and some of the world elements are intriguing, its desire to cater to every possible audience with a complete lack of direction or effort make it nothing short of a failure. If you&#039;re not a sexually-frustrated teenage boy who hasn&#039;t yet developed a distinction between good and bad anime, avoid this one.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give Zero no Tsukaima a 3 out of 10.

    Warning: Minor spoilers (that don&#039;t really ruin much at all), as you&#039;ll see the majority within the first two episodes.<br />
<br />
This is a review for all four seasons, posted here to warn you of how much pain you might be coming across. I&#039;ve watched some pretty bad anime but Zero no Tsukaima and its sequels are very high up. I was spurred to finish it by the suggestion of a friend saying it got better and because I can&#039;t stop what I&#039;ve started. Note - This is my first review and my opinion, think of it as you will.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10<br />
Over four seasons half the 50 or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194131">
        so episodes could probably be considered fillers. The storyline itself jumps from one sudden and convenient issue to another with not much really linking it together. Zero&#039;s subplot of the apparent romance between the Mage and her familiar attempting to progress yet the situations they pop up in are beyond repetitive and dull.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
Nothing amazing and nothing awful, nothing about the art really bothered me nor drew my fascination.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
See the above <br />
<br />
Characters 3/10<br />
Here&#039;s the best bit. Within most anime that have two MC&#039;s, you&#039;d hope to like at least 1 of them. Nope. As shown in the synopsis, Louise is a mate whose powers are lackluster. Her apparent talent that is picked up involves the overused &quot;explosion&quot; spell that is seen at a minimum of 3 times an episode. Her other talent is kicking the other Mc in the balls, as well as being an unsympathetic, trust/confidence lacking, angry, wannabe tsundere who never fails to be annoying. Saito, realistically, is just as bad, as someone who got transported from Earth to a different planet/universe, and immediately treated like shit (or a plebian) he, throughout most of the series, can be seen as someone without a backbone, who is probably a masochist considering he&#039;s so loyal and loving to a bitch that assaults him. Worse still, the &#039;assault&#039; gag is so overused he just becomes a complete pushover whose only motive is to &#039;protect&#039; someone who struggled to even comprehend his situation of being in a different world, and can&#039;t actually reciprocate his love 95% of the time. Funnily enough the best characters (with spines!!) were the supporting cast, Siesta, Jessica and Kirche, who actually had a personality and were enjoyable to watch. Later supporting characters are too, won&#039;t reveal names, but they somehow make you wish Saito picked a girl that, I don&#039;t know, actually and obviously likes/loves him. (P.s, this should have a harem tag instead of romance). All in all, don&#039;t get too attached to two boneheaded mc&#039;s, you&#039;ll be disappointed. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3.5<br />
I did like some of it, mainly when the supporting characters were largely involved with pissing off Louise as a team, otherwise I struggled through this when I usually finish a season (12 eps) a night rather than taking me two, dreadful, weeks.<br />
<br />
Overall 4/10<br />
Please be careful watching this (though hopefully I&#039;ve put you off), don&#039;t expect anything to get better, Saito will always get caught being with someone else and the most overused gag ever will waste your time.

    Story:<br />
.. not many plots in here and some are realy obvious but zero no tsukaima isn&#039;t exactly the kind of anime where serious and complicated plots would fit in.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Its the usual anime.. looks good, can&#039;t say much bad about it.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound fits realy well and I loved the opening song :)<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
ah.. this is anime is kinda wierd, first and for all.. don&#039;t forget that the main characters have the mentality of 12 year olds(not including the idea of punishment.. you will understand once you&#039;ve seen louise angry) so.. even if certain things get explained and feelings start to develop.. there never is much of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1688">
        change in the situation(which is good or else half of the humor in this anime would be gone)<br />
There will the occasional side story but the main characters are the main characters meaning that they will appear in everything and anything.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
warning: you could die while laughing<br />
realy, this anime&#039;s strong point is its humour and there are very few episodes in which this won&#039;t be seen.(make sure you get fansubs that explainsome of the jokes aswell)<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I lost my voice after watching the entire serie in one go because of all the laughter(this probaply won&#039;t happen to everyone unless you laugh as much as I do) This is one of the funniest anime&#039;s out there and its worth a try(theres also a little romance in it)

    Zero no Tsukaima should be an enjoyable action anime based in a majestically magical world, sadly it executes the premise horrendously, clinging to repetitive comedy and a subpar plot. The characters were written poorly; this is evidenced by their shallow nature and monotonous interaction, of which Saito and Louise are the worst offenders.<br />
<br />
So, Zero no Tsukaima (after this abbreviated as ZnT) has a premise of a modern Japanese boy who ends up in a fantasy world after being summoned by her master, who happens to be a young, petite girl, with a fiery attitude. And with these two not getting along too well, this should

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95579">
        set things up for a nice rom-com, right..?<br />
<br />
In practise it gives a different result, the slapstick humour is overused and literally milked down to the very last drip. As a show which relies on its comedy, it should be a lot more variable. But because it lacked in this department, it often came over as annoying, this form of comedy has been used well, just not in this show. If you repeat the same guy getting hit by the same girl for doing the same troublemaking, you are not get any more fans from it. <br />
<br />
The other part ZnT tries to attract its fans with is action and fighting against the forces of evil, now it did this a bit better. Though the plot itself was far too simple to be properly praised, the way it executed its action and the fact that it could get serious for once, meaning some actual romance ensuing, which came along with some cheesy lines by the protagonist was one of the few things I have enjoyed about the series.<br />
<br />
The plot itself, which was put on a side track, is mainly about the two protagonists overcoming the tests they are given at their academy, and how they deal with their &quot;growing&quot; feelings with each other.<br />
<br />
The art-style is simple and quite easy to grasp, it suits the rom-com style it has. The animation is good, but nothing special. Not a lot to comment about this particular department. <br />
<br />
The sound, which can be split into 3 different categories, Opening and ending themes, voice actors and general SFX. The first category, I think the opening fit the anime quite well, of course, it is all up to you whether you liked it or not, but if you enjoyed the anime a lot, the chance is a higher that you liked the themes and soundtrack it had as well. On the subject of voice actors I would like to stop a bit, since this anime contains what many have dubbed to be &quot;The Tsundere Queen&quot; in it. Now personally, I am not the biggest fan or her voice or roles, it is a little bit too high-pitched and comes over as annoying. Saito&#039;s image as a Louise&#039;s dog and maybe a slightly foolish teenager is well played by his respective voice actor. Other than that there is not too much to to be said. The SFX is something which is done, there is noting  extraordinarily odd. So it is hardly something people can discuss about. <br />
<br />
Now I will move on to the characters, which is my biggest disappointment of this whole series, there is not much in this pile of badly written characters I can give praise. So we have our main male protagonist Saito, who like I said earlier, came from the modern world, we know and live in. The first flaw I would like to give is, there is no desire to go back to his home. Does this person have the worst life in the world or something, normally, at that age. One would like to go back to his home. This is, in my opinion, a piece of bad writing on the aspect of backstory and character depth. By not making them have a past, they are very shallow, and this depth-ness is what distinguishes the generic character from the fleshed out one. <br />
<br />
The second character who is ripe for some founded criticism is the main female protagonist, who is awfully loud &amp; obnoxious. I would go as far to say that her character has been written in a way, that it effectively negates any progression this character could go through. When some kind of advance happens in the terms of romance between Saito and Louise (the main female protagonist), it is immediately undone by some kind of slapstick moment. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is not worth a lot either, they have a low amount of motivation and hardly any depth as to why they should fight the protagonists, aside from the whole evil organization stuff. <br />
<br />
The conclusion, is it worth watching? No. There is a lot of stuff which did this setup and plot better than this series, the positive point is that the second season is done a bit better, I might say that is worth watching.

    I\&#039;ve always had a weakness for magic schools - like Harry Potter\&#039;s Hogwarts. That\&#039;s my main motivation for watching this anime. And who wouldn\&#039;t want to be suddenly thrust into a magical world from a boring life, right?<br />
<br />
The story\&#039;s not as lighthearted as I thought. Immediately there are the ecchi elements and the political conspiracies that surrounds the characters. But other than that, you get what you expect: the marginalized boy and girl who suddenly become the hero and heroine, seemingly more than what they were initially shown to be.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Zero no Tsukaima is a fine anime. Nothing too extraordinary, but not that bad either.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review595">
        Maybe the problem is that it was too short and we never really got the whole picture. Hopefully the second season will be better.

    Zero No Tsukaima is what you&amp;rsquo;d get if you crossed the Harry Potter flicks and Shakugan no Shana. One wonders if the title of the show was a response to the mandate for one-word monikers: Here it Goes Again<br />
<br />
The basic elements of these stories are repeated ad nauseam, but astonishingly there is absolutely no difference. Seeing as there is no hope for redeeming itself from turning to an appalling cliched harem anime, I could not bear watching any longer. It is amazing how it only took five episodes took to suck the life out of me. <br />
<br />
But if you must know, the story started with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8043">
        Saito Hiraga being magically pulled away from Japan and warped to the Tristain Academy of Magic. There she met Louise Fran&amp;ccedil;oise de lulu jar jar binks or whatever her full name was, who was responsible for summoning him. Saito with no clue with whats going on, suddenly became Louise servant. This is the beginning of a magical, romantic adventure between two completely people bond by one resolve. MAN, that is good stuff.<br />
<br />
Beneath the main canopy is another commoner/noble story. I keep wondering why anime always wants to aggregate class conflict in anime&#039;s, it is getting too monotonous and repetitive with all the &amp;quot;He&#039;s/She&#039;s just a commoner&amp;quot; BS getting repeated as twice as much as I can take. It just isnt interesting to have that as a imperative contest for the anime.<br />
<br />
I am sick of how there is no development happening between the couple. They had a chance, since they already made out but there is always the harem value that gets in the way. Plus, it is repulsive that I get to see Louise feel resentment to Saito whenever he gets flirtatious, this inevitably follows, whipping the hell out of the boy, which is a tired comic relief that is used repeatedly, and grows more irritating each time.<br />
<br />
This anime is the exact quantity you get from the recipe of disaster: Harem, dumbass hero, abrasive heroine, unoriginal plot, crippled comedy, paucity of development and uninteresting progression. If that doesnt scares you one bit, then go ahead and watch the show.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how it even brought about to make a name for itself(and two more seasons!). This anime belongs only to from where whence it once came, the trash bin. Spend your time elsewhere(and spend it where at least you wont risk vomiting in the process.)

    Wow, I really was not expecting this to be a good anime, but it turned out much much better than I thought it would. What looked like just an average &amp;quot;I can&#039;t confess&amp;quot; love story turned out to have something special in it, maybe because they got to the point within 13 episodes like most animes don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
STORY: 9/10<br />
<br />
The story is very unique, as far as I can tell. Louise can&#039;t use any magic, but on the day where all 2nd year students summon a familiar to help them, Louise summons a teenage boy from Japan, which is obviously another world from the magical world. From

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8093">
        there it just kind of flows, and the fillers are very entertaining too (If they can even be called fillers).<br />
<br />
ART: 9/10<br />
<br />
I really like the eye styles in Zero, cause im big on those. Everything else is great as well, I didn&#039;t see too many cliches in terms of art (see character for the cliches)<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7/10<br />
<br />
To be honest, it wasn&#039;t anything special. I thought the theme songs were OK, and the music in the anime was good as well. Overall, it was just good. Nothing memorable or anything.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 8/10<br />
<br />
I am actually surprised that I am giving this an 8/10. In fact, this anime probably has all the cliche characters of every anime combined. The tsundere girl, the quiet girl, the playboy, the... uhhh.... slut. Yeah, and there&#039;s even more where that came from. But there&#039;s always a character for everyone to relate to, even though they aren&#039;t that deep. Maybe it&#039;s not worth an 8 here, but I guess this cliche cast really got to me.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9/10<br />
<br />
Obviously since Zero is a romance comedy shounen-ish anime, the enjoyment value is going to shoot the technical values in the face. The way the story is executed is very fun to watch, and the &amp;quot;I want to confess but I can&#039;t&amp;quot; moments are perfectly spread and executed. It&#039;s hard to get that kind of a story right, especially with all the animes out there that have flopped and given this stereotypical plotline a bad name. The comedy is great as well, I found myself laughing out loud at some moments and laughing when I knew what was coming (trust me, you will also.)<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9/10<br />
<br />
What more can I say? If you&#039;re into the romance comedy genre, I highly suggest you pick this up. One of my main concerns in the beginning was how childish it looked, but then I figured out the characters are supposed to be 16 (they look way younger... ?_?). Anyway, I would say if you don&#039;t like this anime within the first 3 episodes, this isn&#039;t for you. But please, just give it a try.

<br />
MAL users prepare your collective anus for what is possible the longest and most rantiest review you will ever read. <br />
<br />
The first half of the review, the episode deconstructions,  should only be read by those who have actually watched the show since it won&#039;t make sense otherwise.<br />
<br />
******************<br />
DISCLAIMERS!<br />
******************<br />
<br />
- Do NOT take this review 100% seriously. While I will say that I personally hated it, it is completely fine if you do like it! I am only poking a bit of fun into, IMO, a very badly written story.<br />
<br />
- Do NOT read if you do not wanted

<br />
- This isn&#039;t really a disclaimer but more of heads up. Since this review is huge there will be grammar mistake and stuff so please forgive me!<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode one<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	Main character is retarded. His reaction for being abducted is very calm and abnormal. <br />
•	He gets thrown the main chicks clothes and presumes its seduction, then acts like a retard (seriously what was he doing?).<br />
•	He just sort of stands about having been abducted, his thoughts contradict his actions.<br />
•	Why is everyone already an asshole in this show, so a human is forcibly made into  familiar without consent and everyone is OK with that no questions asked.<br />
•	The main chick is fucking insane. She is just platinum mad for no reason.<br />
•	Of course she has to kiss him to seal the ritual. Well lots of things wrong with this. Firstly why was this not explained/shown beforehand? And why a kiss? To make their relationship deep and shit?<br />
•	Why was the teacher not informed of the crazy chick beforehand? Why should the teacher just expect to believe her students for no good reason other than it won’t end well?<br />
•	So only after he understands her words he decides to run away instead of asking for help/guidance, logical. O and he comes past one obstacle and the first thing he does is crawl. You have to be stupid to think that would work. It also undermines his whole situation. Does he take being held captive by a “cult” as a joke?<br />
•	 So the asshole with the rose starts levitating the main guy. What a dick. I mean that is one scared human (I think?) and he just playing him like he is some trash. Do the people not understand he is fucking human?<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode two<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	So the main character is chained up. Firstly I have to question the ethics and humanity of Louise since she clearly gives no fucks about our main guy. She seems mentally unstable, after all she go into fits of massive rage and treats her own species like shit. Like would you even treat a familiar like this, even it wasn’t human?<br />
•	Now she starts striping in front of him again. Ok so why does she think of him as a familiar and not human since he looks human and kind of acts like one? Does she have no shame? Also how does she expect him to wash her clothes if he is chained up?<br />
•	O and our main guy once again shows us that he does not take the situation seriously (he has been taken away against his will) by just acting like an idiot when is throw some panties.<br />
•	Also the main guy is a submissive little bitch.<br />
•	Louise won&#039;t even dress herself. I mean that really is the epitome of lazy<br />
•	Main guy seems to have adapted pretty well to the surrounding. I mean if it were me I would try everything to get the fuck away if I were being held AGAINST MY WILL but that’s just me you know. Also does this guy not care about his family? He has not even thought about them. What a guy.<br />
•	Blonde rose guy again shows us his assholely when we find out he is dating two women at once. God is everyone in this show like this? I mean I have still to find one character that is likable.<br />
•	Shounen power for the win. Got to have those cheesy speeches before you fight you know.<br />
•	I also like how convenient it is for his powers to start working. So how much plot armour do you have? I’m betting a lot.<br />
•	See more evidence that Louise is indeed mentally insane. She now has no problem taking care of him even though only at the start of the episode she was convinced he was just a familiar. Like what exactly changed? Because he had a fight with a “noble” and THAT made him look more human?<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode three<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	Tsundere bitch. <br />
•	Well I mean I was already pretty sure but our main character is of course a pervert. How original. How edgy.<br />
•	And I shit you not I think I have experienced the most cringe worthy “song” ever. Like you can tell the writer but a lot of thought into that. Also even our main guy is a dick.<br />
•	WOW. Main guy so smart. His thought process “OK so she has let me off the hook so I think I will continue to make fun of her even though she is crazy and risk not getting food”. Our hero, what a guy.<br />
•	I had a feeling red hair chick was easy but really you want to bang that guy? I mean you have spoken to guy like once and you already want his dick? Makes sense.<br />
•	This show is yoke right? She is in love with him? Kiddingz me?<br />
•	This show never amazes me… that is all.<br />
•	So not only is blond rose guy a cheating bastard but this bitch as well? Whelp.<br />
•	This Louise character is truly a bitch. So after taking him away from red hair slut she proceeds to tell him she is going to treat him like a dog rather than human. HOLY SHIT. She has yet to treat him like a proper human thus far having chained him, eat food off the floor, etc. If she thinks that this is how a human should be treated she is utterly out of her mind.<br />
•	Now she starts whipping him. This bitch needs to die. She is just awful to the people around her. I mean the reason doesn&#039;t even make sense, he is late due to something completely out of his control and she is “jealous” so she whips him. The writer is doing a great job hear making us hate all these assholes.<br />
•	Seriously you’re going to put your hands there on her chest rather than her stomach? Like are you retarded?<br />
•	So both of these chicks kick him the face when he says even something a little bit out of line. What a good way to show their love.<br />
•	Also I’m pretty sure they are both complete idiots. The sword starts talking smack and they assume it’s him even though it sounds NOTHING like him. How smart.<br />
•	 These characters have no redeeming qualities. Main dude is a pervert, he is an asshole, and he complains a lot, retarded and one indecisive bastard.<br />
•	Louise is a tsundere… I have nothing more to add even though I could.<br />
 <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode four<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	The bouncing boob sound. This show is truly classy.<br />
•	So the maid is of course one of those people with low self-esteem until our main guy comes along. Like really I’m sure you would continue absolutely fine without him. After all there is nothing to suggest that you couldn&#039;t.  After all the world building has been extremely poor so far. I know next to nothing about how anything works.<br />
•	So our main guy know red head like him but still chooses to go into her room. If you are not going to give her the goofballs then why go in at all. Like to like to see her tease you but then be like “na fuck you bitch gunna now do the same thing to your rival”. What a guy.<br />
•	O shit drama. Maid now has work for someone else and main guy, knowing her for only a few days will of course do something.<br />
•	Typical bad guy who is a dick for no reason. <br />
•	I like how the main guy just waltz into red head slut’s room and demands her treasure, explains nothing then goes into a fit of rage. Smart guy I swear guys.<br />
•	Much romance. So deep. Shame this guy gives no fucks.<br />
•	This main guy is hard to watch. Why does he just go into any situation head first without thinking about shit? He irresponsible and selfish. Nearly got bitch punished which he seems to care for so much (even though she is a bitch).<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode five<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	“I could wash your panties live” – That main dude<br />
•	Seriously though he is either retarded if he is serious or a masterful troll. I’m going to bet on the former.<br />
•	So my understanding is that ALL the jokes are basically sex/echhi ones. God at least try to be original. I’m going to bet that they going to beat a dead horse to death with these jokes.<br />
•	Yes! More harem bait in the form of the princess… didn&#039;t see that one coming.<br />
•	So queen and bitch meet each other brace each other and state they are friends and only then does main guy ask “do you know each other?. Well of course they fucking do, they just said so!<br />
•	How can no one notice the massive fucking golem? I everyone blind?<br />
•	How am I supposed to take this show seriously when it trying to have a plot. OK so where the fuck are the guards when the golem attacked? Why can bitch break through the barrier being a n00b while the golem cannot? <br />
•	It’s not your responsibility bitch buts it’s not the guards either since we don’t have any…<br />
•	End episode with cliché #5923. You know the old I didn&#039;t run away because otherwise I wouldn&#039;t be an ‘insert relevant’ otherwise.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode six<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	Yhh bitch don’t even think about being nice to my familiar. O familiar I’m going to hit you for not rejecting one the few people who are nice to you. I mean god why doesn&#039;t the main guy understand? Because I certainly don’t.<br />
•	OK. Time to use the logic hammer. So the princess is going too held accountable because of the lack security around the academy and it being around the princess. OK so security must be outright bad since whoever decided to concentrate the guards in a single area is retarded. Like someone could just come from the side, the sky or some angle and give her the deaths. What is stopping them since no one would see them until it’s too late.  After all a fucking GIANT GOLEM was only noticed when it made a huge crack in the wall. And why would the princess be held accountable. Doesn&#039;t she have someone who deals with guard formations and whatnot? Why would they make her do it?<br />
•	Wait so they just let red slut into the meeting no questions asked? Doesn&#039;t she have like a class to attend? <br />
•	OMFG. So the headmaster asks who wants to go after the thief and of course those more suited for the job decline like pussies but agrees for the STUDENTS to go. Wtf what if they die? Will the headmaster just be like “o well”. I’d be OK with this if any effective world building had been established. But through the stuff I&#039;ve seen so far this just seems completely retarded.<br />
•	Lol that justification for letting them go after her. Ok by my logic Louise shouldn&#039;t go since she can’t do magic and is a massive liability. Headmaster states that he has HEARD slut is good at fire magic. So what? You’re going to let her go on hearsay? And from what I have seen her fire magic is no match vs golem. And I can’t comment shy girl since she is bland as all hell. We are TOLD she is a knight (how dull) so I guess that means she is good to go. <br />
•	God those boob shots. Please have mercy on me. Common misconception (probably not to those reading) but boobs of that size and magnitude are actually just distracting rather than attractive. Like 1/7 would not fap.<br />
•	OK so they go into the shed/house thingy to check for clues/staff and proceed to not check… apart from shy girl. So main guy and slut and fucking useless but hey shy girl good job. You’re like the only character to not piss me off.<br />
•	So Tony appears and wreaks shit up and they attack it to no avail. Was I surprised? Of course not, their attacks where going to be fucking useless. <br />
•	So bitch just stands their makes a silly speech about what it means to be a noble because of some pride she has. Is she stupid?  Her pride nearly got her killed if it wasn&#039;t for our plot armoured Saito (main guy = Saito).<br />
•	Holy shit. Main guy bitch slapped bitch. I have no complaints. 7/7<br />
•	She claims that she will be made fun of if she runs. She is mentally unstable I know but come on you would rather die than live and be made fun of a little?<br />
•	Fucking shuonen fights. So boring if you know they no chance of losing in the slightest.<br />
•	O man that twist. Shame I give no shits about her or the people she is trying to kill. Also how did she go from bitch to evil bitch with basically no foreshadowing other than HAIR COLOUR?<br />
•	And we don’t even get to find out why she stole the dam thing. Real.<br />
•	Fuck off main guy you have barely even tried to get back home so stop being so sad fuck one those harem girls you have. Jeez.<br />
•	You are a fucking liar you do not want to go back home so shut your whore mouth.<br />
•	Does this guy enjoy being someone’s servant? I, for the life of me, cannot figure out why he likes her or being a familiar since he is treated mostly like trash.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode 7<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	So the episode immediately starts off retarded with our main guy misunderstanding a kiss on the hand for kiss on the lip. Like bitch clearly stated kiss her on the hand. I mean this interaction isn’t even abnormal from the planet he comes from dammit.<br />
•	Around 7:10 seconds. Why does this exist?<br />
•	Please Dilan-sama have mercy on my soul. I don’t even know anymore.<br />
•	So the slut who washes the dishes wants his dick already. Why?!?  What about this guy makes all women want to fuck him. So according to outside sources this guy is a 4/7 on the “would you bang” scale. I don’t think a 4 warrants all these girls wanting his penis.<br />
•	More assholes again. Of course the tax collector is just a dick for no reason other than to make Saito look like he actually cares.<br />
•	“I’m the only one who is allowed to touch Louise” #Creepy #ThisStillSoundsCreepyWithContext<br />
•	O shit what a tense cliff-hanger. I’m am literally on the edge of my seat. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode eight<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	O look the boob groping “joke” while riding a horse. I swear they used that already… I will tell you what is wrong with this. Firstly holding someone’s chest rather than their stomach is just awkward while riding a horse so it makes no sense from a functional point of view. Also you are that much of a fucking pervert that you can just touch her pancakes. What a dick. This is actually one of the view times I am OK with her giving him abuse. Asshole deserves it.<br />
•	Who hugs likes that’s? Just seems uncomfortable.<br />
•	Just a general thought not related to the episode, I still think that tsundere bitch is completely broken in the head and the way she treats main guy is evil but I think I at least understand some of her anger. This guy is completed retarded and unlikable so I can get the rage. <br />
•	So bitch has the most obvious feelings for main guy and is in utter denial. I am both understanding and totally confused. So does she actually realise she likes him or are her words not representative of her thoughts? Why does she like him? He is selfish asshole and is boring and unfunny. I mean hell, bitch herself probably abuses him for some of these reasons.<br />
•	Wait shy girl and slut are actually friends? Is this real life? Why? They seem to have absolutely nothing common nor do they even speak much to each other unless she is needed for the plot.<br />
•	Gawd, trying to use the sad story tactic huh? Seems grossly out of place in a light-hearted anime about boobs. I mean this will probably go nowhere and shy girl will only serve as more harem bait. Also this scene wasn&#039;t very impactful as it just kind of happened out of the blue with basically no foreshadowing. Like everything just seems to blown way out proportion with the music and crazy mum.<br />
•	HOLD THE FUCK UP. Am I missing something or did I just go full retard? Did the mother of the shy girl drink that potion of mind rape knowing it would mind rape her? Why did she simply not throw is away? She clearly knew it was bad since she took it away from her daughter so why did she herself drink it? This make absolutely no sense what so ever.<br />
•	Wait she can beat a three-headed dragon but not a golem? And without a familiar? Much consistent, so logic.<br />
•	I think one wanting a bath… or for that matter keeping ones self-clean is universal to the human race not just the Japanese. Do you think the rest of us just roll around in the dirt? And yes this is such an insignificant thing but fuck this guy.<br />
•	The maid is too fucking docile. Like really do you not understand the concept of bubbles? Could you not foresee someone being in that water? And why stand that close anyway?<br />
•	He’s having a fucking bath what do you think he is doing? It’s not hard to piece together.<br />
•	Wait a second! Did maid put bath in quotations as to question what a bath actually is? Baths and washing ones-self exists in this word right? <br />
•	OK didn’t she have a pot to transport? Was she like well I’ve broken it so I can stop working now? She is just going to leave it there? Also main guy if you don’t intend to give her the goofballs then man up and tell her to gtfo because toying with her (since you know she likes you) is a dick move.<br />
•	And he upset bitch. What a guy. He likes her right (I’m assuming he must since this a predictable harem/echhi show)? Why does he fuck around with women he is not interested right?<br />
•	Not really sneaking if you rage talk to yourself out loud. Also isn’t talking to yourself like that a sign of mental instability? Telling you guys she is mad in the head.<br />
•	So knowing that bitch is in “love” with main guy, even if it was accidental, will main guy do? I’m guessing he will mess around for a bit a toy with her some more. That is our main protagonist friends.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode nine<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	OK so this is a love comedy magic fantasy things so I get love potions a one those things that just exist in these kind of settings but is just seems highly unethical to use one of these things. Doesn’t forcing someone to love you beat the whole of someone loving you? And with consent? Also why does blond girl want blond rose guy to even like her? I got the impression she hated him? Since you know he is a dick to her.<br />
•	O gawd everything this blond guy says sounds like it came out of an 80’s cheesy romance movie (not that I have ever watched one, just speculation on my part). He is basically as 1 d as you get. His personality is a potato.<br />
•	Honestly I think one of things that most annoys about this anime is how its setting has potential. So you basically could explore a massive amounts of things/themes within the setting like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? How sad<br />
•	Real! Love potions are forbidden by law. So how did blond bitch get a hold of one? Does she not care both the law and human ethics?  She seems a like a pretty horrid person.<br />
•	Blond girl doesn’t even look like she cares she forced some to love someone else without consent (this sounds stupid but it forbidden by law no?). <br />
•	I like how they can leave the academy no one even cares/notices. Like they have places which they stay in so I assume they are supposed to stay on campus right? I mean don’t get me wrong if you want to leave campus no one should be allowed to stop you but isn’t it board daylight so wont classes be on? They are going to be punished for skipping class’ right?<br />
•	The “comedy” is so bad in this show. I don’t really like to judge shows on comedy since I don’t understand Japanese comedy but this is just outright bad. So blond guy is “drowning” right and unlike any normal person he just continues to flap around like a retard other than just swimming to the edge since it literally like a meter away. Also can’t he just levitate himself out of water or something? <br />
•	Has main guy killed before? He seems awfully ok with just killing a bunch of people for a tear. Given they are probably a bunch of assholes but I know I wouldn’t want killing a bunch of people on my conscious. Unless I’m misinterpreting eradicate for another meaning other than kill then this guy is an even bigger asshole than I could have ever though he would be.<br />
•	I don’t understand the love potion. So let us assume the only thing the potion does is make someone fall in love with you and nothing else is changed. Bitch already was in love with the main guy… the only difference of not being affected with a love potion is that she was unable to share her feelings. Now that she can share her feeling why does she act completely different? She should still have that same bitchy personality but know she is just clingy and paranoid. A love potion shouldn’t cause her to have an entirely different personality.<br />
•	Main guy treats bitch like she is 3 or something. “Be a good girl and stay there.” How condescending can you be? She is probably around the same age as you.<br />
•	Wait a second was that a… decent plot twist? Don’t get me wrong everything is so shitty at this point that I can’t feel happy about but it was foreshadowed last episode so I don’t feel completely cheated it was them. Still though, shit characters and awful plot still make this bad moment. There is still NO tension or drama so it is just… disappointing <br />
•	I feel like this is a little too serious over a fucking love potion in a comedy romance anime.<br />
•	It’s one of those intense cliff-hangers guys. The mysterious man is named Cromwell, o shiiit.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode ten<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	See this is what annoys me. We have these “Germania” and yet we know nothing about them. So how am I supposed to feel when she tells bitch this? I take it that this is bad since she clearly doesn’t want to get married but honestly I feel nothing. I know nothing of Germania or the fucking country they live in. <br />
•	This entire scene is out of place. To my understanding this show is a comedy harem show not a show with a plot and characters that matter. Like why would I care about any of the stuff they are talking about? Even for those who like the show this scene is just weird. I don’t know about any of the politics or nations or anything and the writers have decided to show us the worst way possible… by telling us rather than showing us. How am supposed to feel like any of this has meaning if I don’t get to see/experience it? How am I supposed to know Germania is really “barbaric”?<br />
•	Well of course our main guy has the most powerful element: void. How exciting.<br />
•	Cliché #4128 “You know, I will protect you” speech. I mean really now does such a thing have to be said? Shouldn’t it be a given that you protect her. I mean you might want to just reinsure her but could you have done it in a less cheesy fashion?<br />
•	Again lack of foreshadowing has prevented any potential drama and interest from happening. This Ward-sama has come out of nowhere and is bitch’s husbando to be. Only problem with this is there was no build up or tension so I don’t really care. I also know that things will just resolve in nice knotted bow so yhh.<br />
•	He is a nice guy huh? I bet you haven’t even had a conversation with him yet so you know not enough to make such an assumption. <br />
•	Wait just a second? NO guy would do what this does if he didn’t want to give bitch the goofballs. Lying bastard.<br />
•	I could be totally wrong and I legitimately mean it but I’m going to put money that ward-sama is not a nice guy.<br />
•	I think another reason I don’t care they are getting married is that main guy doesn’t actually care. So why are they making a big thing out of it? Would be way more interesting if main guy actually tried to fight for Louise’s love.<br />
•	Much drama. So original. 7/7 would watch again<br />
•	Why are they suddenly fighting? This has come out of nowhere. No logical build up or anything. This makes no sense. What even is logic?<br />
•	So main guy loses to Ward-sama and Ward-sama is like you are unable to protect bitch. While I agree somewhat with that statement it is still a little off. Firstly how to expect some teenager to beat you? It’s not exactly fair is it now. Also just because he lost to you doesn’t mean he will lose to others. He beat a golem your statement “you are unable to protect bitch” is inaccurate.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode eleven<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	He is crying? WHY?!? Are you just a giant pussy because you got beat in a fight you agreed to?<br />
•	This guy just makes me even more fucking mad. This is actually one of the most awful characters I have ever seen. Even when bitch tries to cheer him up he just acts like a little emo bitch. Get over yourself and grow some balls.<br />
•	O no Tony is back. Also really the clichéd #5331 evil laugh for no apparent reason.<br />
•	This Ward-sama is fucking creepy. Why does he feel the need to whisper I will protect you into her ear? She not only heard you the first time but if you really felt the need to tell her again wouldn’t you have done it in a more normal way? A way that makes you seems less creepy.<br />
•	FUCK OFF! ALL CAPS MODE ON! WHERE THE FUCK DID RED SLUT AND SHY GIRL COME FROM. WHY ARE THEY HERE? HOW DID THEY KNOW WHERE TO COME FROM? AND WHAT VERY CONVIENT TIMING!<br />
•	Attacking from the side lol. She very clearly attacked you from the front. Mad coz bad?<br />
•	You yoking me? She can just jump into the air and teleport off. Amazing. <br />
•	How the fuck could red slut find out where they went? The only people who knew about the trip where the princess and those on the trip. So who could she have asked to find out? It couldn’t have been princess since she must have left as soon as she was done. Was it magic because that would be waaaay to convenient? And just because she said it took her all day to find out does not make it a valid reason. <br />
•	Main guy again being an asshole. He asks a question the inn keeper and he answers him. And only because the answer was not specific enough he has to throw a fit and slams the desk. What a guy. <br />
•	Real. She somehow heard Saito’s voice over an impossibly huge distance. I guess that makes their relationship deep and shit now?<br />
•	Lol. “There is no one here” Suddenly 10 guards in front of your face. How could you miss them?<br />
•	What? Now there is a war? And an organization pulling the strings? You are just making this shit as you go along aren’t you?<br />
•	FUCKING CALLED IT! Ward-sama is a bad man. How predictable can this show get!<br />
•	And they make bitch in need of help. Cliché #1 “Damsel in distress”. If you’re going to you use this please add something original otherwise you are a complete failure of a show.<br />
•	Pls no more cheese in my face. Pls no more extremely convenient timings or cliché dialog.<br />
•	O no you killed the guy that only have 2 mins of screen time! Masterful writing and timing. What a twist! Seriously though how do expect me to feel anything for this guy? I couldn’t care less since I don’t even know who he is.<br />
•	Right so this guy just wants to marry bitch for her personality? WHY??? Explanations are in order right? It would make sense if you wanted to marry her for political power or something but this just makes no sense.<br />
•	Jesus penis more ass pulls. Suddenly he has the power to absorb magic and make his sword stronger for no reason other than heart power? Why bother have him fight at all if he is just going to auto win? It’s like playing a game on very easy when you have already completed the game on normal. Like why play the game on very easy at that point. You already know how to play the dam thing.<br />
•	“If we linger why any longer we are done for” say that while lingering. Why don’t you just move then?<br />
•	OK so they kiss at the end. I kind of don’t mind this since it’s not in your face and shiz. Shame the characters, setting, and everything about the show sucks. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Episode twelve<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	I don’t think you can take full responsibility here. How about the people who hired Ward to be the guide. Surely it was there job to ensure that he would fulfil he his duties and that the fact he was unable to shows they hired the wrong person. <br />
•	I like how the show is regressing rather than progressing. At this point the climax to the finale should be getting bigger. Why the episode has started with more echhi/tsundere shenanigans is beyond me. Why is it slowing down with only two episodes to go?<br />
•	I fucking hate main guy. The asshole kisses bitch then acts like nothing happened. Why is he in denial? Also at this point he MUST know bitch likes him. So why does he just run off with maid and not explain anything to bitch? You are at the very least friends so the least you could do is explain why you are leaving. Jeez<br />
•	Explain to main guy why is it ok that you don’t tell her? It’s not like you had to go right then and there I’m sure she would have given you time to talk to bitch.<br />
•	OK so it’s going to be like that huh? You’re going to deny that you like bitch for whatever reason. You writers make me sick, just making main guy be in denial for no logical reason other than to keep this haram shit going. Pls stop writing.<br />
•	Why does he look like he actually wants to go back home? This guy has barely said or done anything to even try to get back. I’m sorry but he is just a walking contradiction.<br />
•	More random sad moments that come out of nowhere! So the princess was in love the prince? Where did this come from? And why should I care? I barely knew either of the characters.<br />
•	How do expect him to mass produce gasoline if he doesn’t even know what it is? Do you even know how it’s made? Because given the technology this world has it seems to be it would be pretty hard to obtain.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Last episode<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
•	Weird that they add a bunch of new sound effects to the OP of the last episode. I don’t really get it since they sound out of place since it doesn’t flow well with the sound already there.<br />
•	“I will take command of our military” – Princess. OK time to use the logic hammer again. So the show has failed to present anything that would suggest you would be good at commanding an army. If anything the anime has suggested you would be an awful candidate for such a job. After all remember when that golem attacked the academy and you thought it would be a good idea to concentrate all your troops into one super dense area so you didn’t even know you were being attacked? It seems to be you are horrible at strategy and tactics. GG WP!<br />
•	Notice how half of his memories are ones of either abuse or sadness with bitch. See how their relationship is mostly artificial with no real weight? <br />
•	That is the most underwhelming invasion I have seen. One ship? Kiddingz me?<br />
•	That outfit the princess is wearing seems pretty impractical. What is she going to do? Seduce her enemies to death (which to be fair might not be the worst plan…)? <br />
•	OK I thought the invading parties numbers where underwhelming but the defending side is a joke. How am I supposed to take this war seriously? Also why the fuck is bitch there? She can’t possible defend herself against trained soldiers. Won’t she be a massive liability?<br />
•	Why is blond rose guy still in his uniform? This show is retarded.<br />
•	I have no more yoke to give. I don’t understand anymore. The impracticability of both flying a plane and using his sword at the same time. <br />
•	Where are the defending sides’ mages? Don’t they have any? Why is just Tony a problem?<br />
•	Even more retarded stuff. Why doesn’t she make a new golem? Why was she not burned to deaths since she was covered in the oil?<br />
•	Ward-sama has map awareness of a potato. Isn’t this guy to be an elite fighter? Why didn’t he see that dragon attack coming from a mile away?<br />
•	Of course Loiuse happens to be super op and have the most broken magic in the world. How interesting. See this is just boring since we know that it’s just bound to work with no consequence. <br />
•	Did bitch just mass murder everyone on the opposing side? Given the attacking side where a bunch of dicks and I don’t think they had a chance to surrender but still…<br />
•	So after all he has been saying about how badly he wants to get home he fucking doesn’t? FUCK OFF! You lying piece of shit. I guess this is just a middle finger to your family huh? “O sorry guys I’d rather flirt with a bunch of girls than be with my family”. Our fucking hero, what a guy!<br />
•	Cliché villain is beaten just like that. What an ending you know. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Since I have a lot to conclude I will divide the conclusion into multiple sections.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Characters<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So this is where most of the problems lie in this show. A decent show at least depends on characters that are likable and this show has no likable characters. I will deconstruct the ones that matter and give my opinion on how they can be improved.<br />
<br />
Saito - This is possible the worst character of this show... or of any show. He <br />
fails even the most basic traits of a good character. He is not relatable in any <br />
way having basically zero charisma, being an asshole for no reason, flirts around with a bunch of women even though he likes Louise and she likes him back, indecisive, rushes head first without thinking about it, etc.<br />
<br />
He also doesn&#039;t care much about his family which he basically never mentions and never feel homesick yet always makes the claim that he wants to return home. Not only is this a contradiction but it makes him come a across as a heartless asshole. <br />
<br />
What the writers could have done IMO is have him talk a little bit about his family. This would not only make him come across as a more likeable and relateable guy but actually proves that he wants to go back home.<br />
<br />
<br />
Louise - Her character is just a complete and utter mess. I don&#039;t like the tsundere archetype since these people don&#039;t actually exist in real life so its hard to relate to them however if character development/history is explored and developed enough then that is perfectly acceptable.<br />
<br />
Her tsundere ways are, however, not even remotely explained so she just comes across as a crazy bitch. Had the writer just been bothered to give even a small explanation then her character might have been bearable. And personally I would have toned down the crazy a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
No other characters are worth talking about since they are just 1-D cardboard cutouts.<br />
<br />
My overall score for characters is 1/10. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Story<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The story is abysmal if you can even call it a story. The structure and flow and completely nonsensical. It basically does its own thing when it likes and how it likes it. Since I cant describe the story much beyond the synopsis because it is so random I will not bother.<br />
<br />
Instead I talk about how how the story could be improved. For one the story could actually have a sense of direction by using, for example, the goal of the protagonist to get home and his journey. It can also explain some of the themes its premise presented like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? (taken from episode nine). By using these the story could be great!<br />
<br />
Story gets a 1/10<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Animation, art-style, sound, acting and all that jazz<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Honestly all of this stuff was alright but not great. The animation was alright apart from the fights which where just very unimpressive and uninspired.<br />
<br />
The art was kinda OK. Backgrounds where actually pretty decent  but character designs where mediocre. Saito&#039;s in particular was bad, just being very bland and generic just like his character. At least SAO had amazing visuals to make up for its awful writing. <br />
<br />
Sound was decent. That is all. Voice acting was also decent. No one stood in particular but no one was bad.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5.5<br />

My enjoyments/final thoughts<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Alright so I hated this anime but at the same time I also quite enjoyed it. Yup. It was fun ripping it apart and being honest I can kinda maybe understand if someone liked this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment gets a 7/10<br />
<br />
The main reason I rate the show so low is because of the potential it hard to better than the average with its intriguing setting and possibilities. But because it failed it has made me sad and mad.<br />
<br />
The show gets a 1/7. WOULD NOT WATCH EVER AGAIN!!!!!! <br />

    I enjoy a good romcom every once and a while, and if it can be combined with another genre to create more or better situations, then all the better right?  A situation, setting, and characters can make a romcom really good, even if it&#039;s taking an old concept and adding in a new element.  <br />
<br />
So we get Zero no Tsukaima.  the story of a noble mage from a magical realm and her familiar, a human from our world.  Sounds like a good mash-up like Inuyasha, Shakugan no Shana, or any of the many magical girlfriend animes out there.  The problem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48983">
        is, this series, though it combines familiar elements to make something new, it does not seem to work well.  While I loved Baka to Test for combining slice of life high school drama with monster training, this simply did not do it for me.  To be honest, Zero came off as cut and pasted together, with nothing really original to offer.  <br />
<br />
Plot:  Louise is a mage in training in her second year who must summon a familiar as part of her curriculim/rite of passage.  In what seems to be a freak accident, Louise summons a normal boy from our world in moddern Japan.  Hilarity ensues?  <br />
<br />
Most of the plot revolves around Louise and the boy, Saito&#039;s relationship.  Saito struggles with wanting to go home, Louise struggles to prove herself a strong and capable mage, and the two go on various missions together.  Oh, yeah, and boobs.  It seems at every twist and turn there is some woman with a large chest who is inexplicably attracted to Saito.  Misunderstandings ensue and Louise whips Saito with a riding crop in an attempt at slapstick comedy.  Besides, we&#039;ve seen this in almost every other romcom harem comedy.  Boy meets girl, boy sees other girl in suggesgive situation, original girl beats ever loving crap out of boy.  This might be funny once or twice, but the joke repeats, and repeats and repeats on a loop throughout the whole series.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  And when a relationship does start to develop between Saito and Louise, Saito still seems to be interested in other girls.  Rather than using this for actual conflict or drama, it results in, yep, more whipping.  No development of their relationship, no understanding, just whipping.  Louise doesn&#039;t even bother switching up punishments, or using other gags as punishment.  <br />
<br />
As for the magical school element, many have compared this to Harry Potter.  I would sooner compare it to The Worst Witch.  In a magical school, Mildred Hubble is the worst witch, unable to perform even the most basic spells and earned the nickname &#039;Worst Witch&#039; from her peers, and later discovers she, in her own way, is in fact quite powerul.  Sound familiar?<br />
<br />
The story takes a turn about halfway through and tries to add in a little political intrigue.  Tries.  In the end, it doesn&#039;t really accomplish the backstabbing, coat and dagger politics of Last Exile or Le Chevalier D&#039;Eon.  They seem to be trying, adding in familiar, historical and mythological elements to the story.  Unfortunately, they are often full of holes, poorly executed, or seem to come completely out of nowhere.  Let&#039;s take Tabitha for example.  The quiet bookworm friend of Louise&#039;s school rival Kirke is revealed to be a Princess from Gallia.  She might have inherited the throne too, if her father had not been murdered by a faction that wanted to put her father&#039;s brother on the throne instead.  Her uncle also wanted Tabitha out of the line of succession (which would not happen with Early modern primogeniture laws in which MALE heirs suceed) and one of his supporters tries to kill her via a glass of poison.  Her mother gets wind of it and...alright, seriously, if someone tries to poison your kid do you A) Take the poison away from her and use it as evidence to bring the bastard to justice  B) Take the poison away from her and dispose of it so everyone will be safe  C) Take the poison away from her and drink it youself inducing a lifetime of mental scars for your child and leaving her to fend for herself when you become and insane vegetable.  Tabitha&#039;s mother and parent of the year chose C.  Political intrigue?  Yes.  Well executed?  No, not really.  <br />
<br />
What really grates me about this series though is the History parallels.  Each country has an Early Modern European counterpart.  Gallia is France, Germania is Germany and Albion is England.  Might be original if I hadn&#039;t seen it in Trinity Blood first.  But in the Albion subplot, involving a revolution, involved elements that personally offended me as someone with Irish heritage.  <br />
<br />
A romcom with excessive panties and gags about boobs, brought up Oliver Cromwell.  <br />
<br />
Not Cromwell himself, but his equivalent in a parallel universe.  That still doesn&#039;t make it acceptable to me though.  Some might say I&#039;m butthurt over something that happened hundreds of years ago, but this to me is serious.  Oliver Cromwell slaughtered 25-40% of Ireland&#039;s population, and became the closest thing to a military dictator England hand, led an ultra Puritain regime that banned Christmas, staughtered Catholics by the thousands, and these people had the absolute gall to turn him into a villain in an anime romcom focusing on panties and boobies.  Next time, let&#039;s imply something about Hitler, shall we?  <br />
<br />
The Sound was something I kind of liked.  It was nothing special, but the European flavor brought out the exotic location well.  The J-pop opening was cute, and fitting with the cutesy style of the characters and the romantic comedy premis, and the ending seemed to sum up the character&#039;s feelings as well.  If you have a choice between sub and dub, pick sub.  The English voice track left a LOT to be desired.  <br />
<br />
The art was reminissent of moe and seemed to have a slight influence from nineties fantasy anime like Escaflowne.  The animation was nothing mindblowing, but it stayed at a consistently good level throughout the whole series, never really dipping in quality.  Character designs are pretty standard.  There&#039;s the flat loly, her big breasted mature rival, the book worm, the playboy, the fat kid, the old wizard, the normal boy...we;ve seen them before, and honestly they did not try to do anything really new or unique in the character designs.  <br />
<br />
As for the characters themselves, they might as well been pulled out of a stock folder.  The young girl who has useless magic and turns out to be a sort of &#039;chosen one&#039;.  The busty and sexually mature rival to the smaller girl who&#039;s main motivation is sex/love.  The bookworm with a tragic/interesting past who rarely speaks or socializes.  The playboy.  The perverted old man.  The normal everyman for otaku boys to project themselves on.  Villains whose main motivations are being evil for the sake of being evil (seriously, they take over a kingdom, and slaughter the royal family, and we have no idea WHY.  Also the Cromwell reference.  I won&#039;t forgive this series for that.)  None of the characters seem the least bit original, and their dialogue is completely cliched.  <br />
<br />
As for Enjoyment, I know a lot of people like this series and I can see why.  There&#039;s something here that almost everyone can enjoy.  Girls can get into the romance, guys can like the fanservice and explosions.  At the same time though, it&#039;s all usually underdeveloped, cliched, or unexplored.  I suppose this might be covered in later seasons, but in this one, nothing really gets resolved.  The good guys save the day, but the show&#039;s main focus, Louise and Saito&#039;s relationship does not seem to have changed since day one.  Saito screws up, Louise beats him, end series.  For those who like the cliches, good for you and you will probably like this.  For me, I didn&#039;t, I explained why, and please respect that.  <br />
<br />
Warnings:  Panties galore, boobs, boob gags, mild language, character death, fighting, explosions, abusive relationship, reference to debatably genocidal miserable wretch of a human being who slaughtered my ancestors.

Plot Synopsis<br />
Louise is a magician at the Tristein Academy, dubbed with the nickname &amp;quot;Zero Louise&amp;quot; due to her inability to effectively use her magic properly, resulting in zero successes. An upcoming test at her academy requires her to summon a familiar, a servant and partner to support her as a magician. Despite desiring a familiar that would be superior to her constantly mocking classmates, Louise ends up summoning Hiraga Saito, your average Japanese boy. Even with Louise and Saito both unwilling to accept each other, they have no choice. Louise cannot attempt

(From MyAnimeList)<br />
<br />
Personal Opinion<br />
I heard about this anime a little while back... though I wasn&#039;t completely sure if i wanted to see it or not. Finally, I was like &amp;quot;what the hell&amp;quot; and I decided to watch this.<br />
Indeed the premise, opening, and photos seemed to promise a fun, comedic anime. And for all intesive purposes, it was. However... it wasn&#039;t as funny as i would&#039;ve hoped. Some of the jokes tend not to work. Indeed, I kept thinking that this show would&#039;ve been better if it had a bit more action to tie in with the jokes.<br />
However, towards the end of the season, the action, character development, and comedy picked up and i really started to enjoy the show.<br />
As for things i liked, the biggest ones would be the voice actors. They&#039;re the same people from Shakugan no Shana.... so whenever Louise would yell at Saito, it was like a good deja vu.<br />
Also the animation is quite well suited for the anime.<br />
<br />
Also as a note... there is a sequel series that has already aired. Zero no Tsukaima; Futatsuki no Kishi.<br />
And a 3rd season is confirmed for the Spring 08 season<br />
<br />
Overall... enjoyable series... though fell a little short of expectations<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Similar to...<br />
- Shakugan no Shana<br />
Both the lead characters are girls, and they both have a hard time expressing their feeling for the main boy of the series. Also the same voice actors.<br />
<br />
- Fullmetal Alchemist<br />
 <br />
Both these animes had the parallel world idea, with one world being our own, and the other one having the ability of magic.<br />

    Story 3/10<br />
The story starts in a magic school where the failure of a female lead summons our protagonist to be her familiar. A magic school is a wonderful ideal in theory however this is not used in any sort of effective manner. It uses magic in the story but only for minor bits of action and torturing Saito so it takes the fantasy out of it. It quickly devolves into a bland, tasteless harem comedy that really isn&#039;t even that funny. The characters have no really explored back-story and feel like they were picked out of a harem character pool of cliches.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
I have no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186932">
        real complaints about the art. It doesn&#039;t blow you away but it&#039;s pretty decent.<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10<br />
The sound wasn&#039;t bad and the OP was pretty good. The ending song however leaves much to be desired so the score takes a beating in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Character 1/10<br />
I would have given a lower score if it was possible. This score does not take into account voice actors.<br />
First the protagonist, Saito, He has no depth to him at all. When he was being tortured he took it like it was no big deal and he had no real inclination to run away after the first time. He is then found to love the one character who treats him like crap.<br />
Next we have the main female character, Louise, who is also said failure. She is a character with absolutely no good points whatsoever. She is without a doubt the worst main female character I have ever seen. She is advertised as a tsundere but we quickly find she is just a really horrible human being. She made the anime go from harem comedy to glorified torture porn, BDSM, etc. within two episodes. She tortures, starves, and verbally abuses him in a way that goes from funny to cringe-worthy in halfway into the second episode and it never really goes back to funny. She has tons of pride but no fighting ability whatsoever.  She makes herself fight all the time and then ends up having to be saved by the very guy she tortures on a daily basis.<br />
The rest of the characters really only serve as a way to give Louise new reasons to torture said MC. <br />
<br />
Overall 2/10<br />
The art and sound are decent but do nothing to make up for the story itself. The plot is boring and where sometimes cliched does not mean bad this story makes it worse. The characters though are what truly makes this story truly horrid.<br />
<br />

    Tsundere galore! Zero no Tsukaima (or The Familiar of Zero) tells the story of two lovers – or so we are told. This delightful anime takes place in a fictional world where magic is all around and aristocrats (in other words: the rich people; as opposed to plebeians, the average peeps) are being taught magic in school. We are introduced to a magic academy where Louise Francoise is having difficulty keeping her spells under control and therefore is being scorned by her fellow classmates who call her Zero Louise.<br />
<br />
Things take a rather interesting turn when the day comes for the students to summon their familiars

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25865">
        (some sort of special ritual where everyone gets to summon a magical creature that will protect them and be at their side forever) and Louise unwillingly summons a human plebeian named Saito, who seems to have arrived from another world. Although Louise is rather reluctant to accepting Saito as her familiar, she is left with no choice and must come to terms with the fact that she is no bound to Saito. Her “tsundere” side kicks in when she starts punishing Saito for little insignificant things like talking to other girls or disobeying her ridiculous commands, and he is forced to sleep on the ground and wash her clothes, among other things.<br />
<br />
Zero no Tsukaima isn’t a particularly unique anime series, but it delivers everything your little Asian heart wishes for (I said that in a very non-racist way, believe me!) and much more. The characters are quite stereotypical and you’ve encountered them before if you’re even in the slightest familiar with Japanese anime. Louise is the typical tsundere who treats the guy like crap, but deep inside he loves him and they share a special connection. Saito is that guy who gets treated like crap but he somehow has feelings for her “master.” Then you’ve got a couple more supporting characters like Kirche who is more or less in conflict with Louise and keeps getting Saito into trouble for flirting with him all the time. There’s also Charlotte, the quiet girl who never speaks but is incredibly powerful and helps the others out at times. Siesta is the “good girl” who works as a maid in the academy and is more or less the third piece in the Louise-Saito-Siesta love triangle.<br />
<br />
The characters may be cliché, but they are done to perfection. They are indeed predictable, but are used in a very modest manner and never exceed in cheap jokes or typical situations. The story seems rather simple at first, but as the plot keeps progressing more and more gets revealed and the little twists here and there make up for some excellent entertainment value. There’s enough humour to go around, but it never feels too much and is used exactly when needed. I was surprised to see how entertaining this anime actually was. From the very first episode, I was hooked and it never let me go. The pace in which Zero no Tsukaima progresses is also done very well and it never feels like the anime was rushing towards a certain point (even though the last couple of episode covered a great deal of story compared to the first ones).<br />
<br />
I could ramble on and on, but that’s about as much as you need to know. It’s not a series that is going to break any new ground, but it is truly one hell of a fun trip and deserves every anime fan’s attention. I didn’t ask for much, but Zero no Tsukaima delivered everything I needed from an anime series. Looking forward to next season!

    The Familiar of Zero is an anime based around Louise the &amp;quot;Zero&amp;quot;, who was given the name by her classmates at the Tristain Magic Academy because of her inability to correctly use her magic. In fact, every time she tries any kind of spell, a big, smokey explosion is caused instead. So when it comes time for Louise to summon her familiar at the annual ceremony, yup, you guessed it. Big, smokey explosion. But she still managed to summon her familiar. However, it&#039;s not a cat, owl, dragon, or bugbear, but instead it&#039;s a human! Hiraga Saito, from our very own Japan even. Things don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10738">
        exactly go straight from there. I beleive that The Familiar of Zero is deserving of a 9 out of 10.

    Zero no tsukaima is set in a fantasy world where the nobles stay separately from the commoners and can practice magic. The story forcuses on a magic school academy for the nobles and on the day that they are to summon their partners, the female lead summons a boy from another world which is our world i guess, however, she believes he is a commoner from her world and treats him like a slave,little do they know that he will become the ledgendary partner or familiar that can own with a sword.<br />
<br />
The story is unique as it differs from your usual fantasy anime, though it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5320">
        does inculcate the typical main chracter is drawn into another dimension theme it does not focus so much on that so it does not seem cliche. Also ifyour thinking of harry potter or something along that line then you are sadly mistaken, the magic is totally different. Also There is a good deal of romance in the story which is a plus for me. Also it gets more interesting when there are massive battles which make it more epic.<br />
<br />
The art is quie appealing and suitable for a romantic comedy but there is no exceptional features.<br />
<br />
The songs(opening and closing) i find are quite pleasant to the ears but there was no insert songs to bring out the mood especially since there is a good deal of romance and drama in the sho, so insert songs would have made it better.<br />
<br />
The character is what make the show so interesting, each character has some kind of depth and makes the story very comical at times, especially since the male lead is kind of perverted so it gets funny cause the female lead will start blasting bolts at him whenever he is wth another girl. Also the characters do show maturity when the time requires it so its not totally spastical, which is what makes the story a good romantic comedy.<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed the story because from the comical moments to the dramtic romance to the epic action clips, so it was quite to my liking though it is kind of short, it would be better if it was longer. But there is a second series so its okay. In fact i think it was a good decision to have two series so that each series will focus on a single arc and have an underlying plot throughout each series which draws in the characters.<br />
<br />
Overall, the story is very versatile containing several genres to some depth,if you like romance then go for it, f you like fantasy then go for it, if you like action then there is something in t for you, so give it  try it is definitely worth it, and if you like this series you will definitely love the second one.
