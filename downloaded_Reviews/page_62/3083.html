    Ghosts are an interesting phenomenon. For hundreds of years, people have been trying to prove the existence of ghosts, as if they exist in this world or not. Among those theories, rumors, and legends related to ghosts often pertains to the supernatural also involving how and why they exist. This is something that ghost hunters enjoy their time doing with their nerdy equipment and whatnot. But here in this show, we have treasure hunters, with a similar passion but rather than seeking out ghosts, they try to find the lost treasures of a murdered girl. <br />
<br />
Enter Nanana Ryūgaj, the ghost and main heroine of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147573">
        series. As a ghost, she is bounded to a special room ever since she was assassinated 10 years ago. And being a ghost, she is usually lonely inside and confined to a little room with nothing but video games and pudding. That is until she meets Juugo Yama, a young man who is an adventurer, working man, and pervert (with a fetish for maids) all the same time. It really can’t be helped since Jugo has nowhere else to go after being kicked out by his own father. A human and a ghost living together? Bring on the irrationality.<br />
<br />
Or rather, maybe a bit lightweight because Nanana may not be the type of girl some may picture her as. Rather than a malevolent ghost seeking for vengeance at any chance, Nanana behaves like an odd girl with NEET tendencies. She doesn’t look like an angry spirit either throughout the duration of the show despite the desperation to find the killer that bestowed this fate upon her. In essence, we have a rather peculiar relationship between Nanana and Jugo packaged into a little adventure. At first, the two does not seem to get along. Nanana finds Jugo to be a nuisance and waste of space. Jugo on the other hand has a keen interest in Nanana although he never seems to impress her. But as the series goes along, we do see a more development between the duo that mutates from acquaintances, to friendship, and possibly even on the edge of romance. <br />
<br />
Based off the light novel of the same name written by Kazuma Ōtorino, there’s some fascination related to the premise of the series. There’s elements of adventure, mystery, drama, romance, and even supernatural all mixed together in a little package. The first episode quickly blasts off with some scenes with Indiana Jones conception and later shifts its focus to Nanae Island. It is here where the series takes place and judging by its technology, there are endless possibilities. Shiki Maboro, the landlady and Nanana’s best friend, provides possibilities for Juugo including a chance for him to provide Nanana some company. Yet behind her façade, there’s a bitter insight of sadness as she wishes to also solve the mystery of Nanana. The series however focuses more on just that as Juugo goes on his own adventures to find Nanana’s buried treasures, specifically the Nanana Collection. <br />
<br />
11 episodes and that’s apparently what’s needed to hammer down an adventure chronicling Juugo’s time as an adventurer. Not only that but the way it wraps up the show is controversial, at least in resolution sense. But really, a show with such potential can be cut back to just that can be compromising. To say the least, the adventure Juugo goes through feels fast paced and lacks that feeling of the classics. Sure, Nanae Island is a high level city to live in but the best way to bring out its potential is to also go out and explore with a real thrill of wanderlust. However, the show confines itself to the island as well as the apartment that Juugo stays in limiting such possibilities. The way the show depicts its adventures instead seems to focus with the other characters that Juugo meets. After joining the school’s Adventure Club, the audience is quickly introduced to more enthusiastic detectives such as Tensai Ikkyu. And as a girl with apparently genius level intellect, she becomes both a helping hand and nuisance during Juugo’s quest. Other characters Juugo becomes acquainted with as a member of the Adventure Club offers diversity. But unfortunately, some of them come with a formulaic throwback and in general, clichés. Examples include the stereotypical Isshin Yuiga, the president of the club with an obsession on treasures. He comes with the complete package with his devious personality, menacing glasses, and a taste to obtain power. The show doesn’t stop with further stereotypes such as providing him a sidekick, a girl named Yu Ibara who worships the ground that Isshin walks on. Others include a master of disguises, a trap that comes with the classy maid gimmick, and hackneyed antagonist with self-motivated interest to do everything to get what he wants. To say the least, it’s a substantial cast of characters layered with clichés and unimpressive gags.<br />
<br />
One interesting aspect to take from this show is the relationships that Juugo develops with others. While most of the main characters are crass with generic attributes, Juugo brings out the best of them on some cases. In one such case, his relationship with a family member become heartwarming. Although it seems frivolous at first, there’s an innate focus on Juugo’s own characteristics as a person who can keep a promise. His inspiring dedication enables him to show what other characters are capable of and when they show a different side of their frontal selves. This even expands to minor supporting characters where they only show up briefly yet Juugo is able to converse with them on an open level. Juugo’s charisma is something I find contagious in a mixed way where he can be someone honest with himself and others. At the same time, his loyalty transpires respect and commands his presence.<br />
<br />
Despite the seriousness of the premise itself involving a murder prior to the start, the series showcases its more fundamental aspects involving the treasures. Each treasure the series reveals has some a different power with a different function. It offers diversity and potential to expand their usage. Unfortunately, the show only touches on their general aspects and ways to get them. It does display their usage though with various results to show how magnificent Nanana’s treasures really are. On the other hand, the comedy is a hit or miss for the audience. Juugo’s perverse actions surfaces from the very beginning and pretty much whenever else when he gets involved with attractive members of the opposite sex. It’s generic as Juugo becomes a punching bag by them on the opposite end. And for some reason, despite being a ghost and even incorporeal, Nanana is able to attack Juugo at her own will. Other parts of intentional humor includes but not limited to tsundere like behavior of Tensai, Juugo’s maid fetish (made awkward since the character he feels those desire towards is a trap), and running gags. In retrospect, the show can feel like it’s trying too hard for its own good.<br />
<br />
Artwork is stylish to say the least but some of the character designs looks a bit generic. Nanana’s design contrasts the menacing features of a ghost with her more girly and curvy figure. Similarly, most female characters in the show has an attractive figure that often makes Juugo’s inner desires surface. Juugo himself is designed like a normal boy with nothing noticeable despite his charisma. But despite this, the show’s setting has great detail provided with its cutting edge technology. Nanae Island is designed with lavish architectures, beautiful landscapes, and garnishes a brand of attentiveness to people looking for inventive ideas. A-1 Pictures adapts the setting and pulls it off when it comes to the overall backgrounds although lacking a bit of effort into the character designs. There is also some fan service with the onsen episode inspiring fan service to pop up and of course, curious camera angles.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is less distinctive but does hold itself together when the push comes to shove. We get comical OST during humorous moments, soft pacing during emotional scenarios, and more action oriented stereo during climatic scenes. The OP and ED song has a delicious taste to it more than just pudding. It has its catchy tone with colorful palate of the main characters, in particular our ghostly superstar Nanana. And finally while most of the voice acting is standard, I give praise to Kana Hanazawa for her ability to play a character of the opposite gender. You’ll be surprised at what you’ll see.<br />
<br />
Taking this show at face value, it could be a hit or miss. It’s one of those shows that can either appeal you or be a waste of time. But for all of its attributes, it is something I consider as throwback. The story has a sound promising premise with a diverse cast of characters. But the execution wasn&#039;t all bright and shiny. That and the absurd comedy could sway some attention from the audience when it seems forceful. As a show with so many things packaged into a single entity, you’d have to expect a sphere of potential but seriously, it wasn&#039;t all that. Not one bit.<br />

    “I spend every day eating pudding, watching TV, and playing online games.” – Ryuugajou, Nanana <br />
<br />
I thought of Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin another colorful spring 2014 anime. With the characters’ having vibrant colored eyes, I thought this was something that stood out the most in a character’s appearance for me.<br />
<br />
This anime tells of a story about Nanana Ryuugajou, who was murdered 10 years before the actual setting of the story. She’s a ghost, living as a NEET, bounded to the room Juugo Yama was given to by Shiki Maporo (the landlady of Happy House – the apartment complex). <br />
<br />
Juugo moves into the room Nanana is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148291">
        bounded to and learns about Nanana’s Collection, also known as Ryuugajou Nanana’s Buried Treasure (hence the title). They are – “treasures of origins unknown”. The ones with unique powers are known as Nanana’s Collection itself. Juugo soon joins the Adventure Club, where the members are solely looking for the treasures.  This is where the plot starts to set in. Juugo and his group of friends will try and find Nanana’s Collection.  With the treasures being set in different locations, along with different setups, they would need a little bit of thinking along the way. But that’s what makes the series interesting, as you try to figure out the setup with the characters. At least, that’s what I tried doing anyway. Haha.<br />
<br />
As I said at the beginning of this review, I thought the character’s eyes are what stood out the most to me when looking at their appearance. The art in Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin is what made finding Nanana’s buried treasure and other situations have a cool, beautiful, detailed setting to it. The backgrounds in the show are casual; some you would see in almost any school/daily life of a 16-year-old type set anime. But when you get to the setup of Nanana’s treasure, it’s awe-inspiring. All of the character designs are kind of like the newer, maybe 2013-2014 art – to me they were also beautifully made; with different colors also made to match their outfits: which add in the anime, being well set in color variety. The series also includes some fan service.<br />
<br />
With how this anime is centered with finding treasure and solving how each setup of the treasure goes, I’d have to say that the OP had that little detective feel into it, for me.  The ED, for me, had that gentle feeling of how Nanana is enjoying her ghostly life, despite any situation. Of course, this is while watching the 1 minute and 30 second ending. The background music/sounds were good in terms of setting the mood/scene in each episode.<br />
 <br />
The characters in the anime are likeable. They are what make this show pretty enjoyable. With Nanana, being the teenage ghost bounded to the room Juugo rented out; Juugo being the one to learn and find out more about Nanana’s Collection, leading to more discoveries to the treasures; Tensai being the master detective and Daruku alongside her; and having other characters just add up to the series as Juugo and them continue to find more treasures. They all added to the story very well, in my opinion. It’s just that there were some problems, in the beginning, in my mind deciding whether or not this character or that character were on the good, bad, or neutral side of the story. Other than that, I thought the characters were pretty well developed.<br />
<br />
Overall, even though I was behind on episodes while this show was airing, I enjoyed Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin – with its treasure hunting, solving the treasures setups, helping each other in times of need, the bits of comedy between characters, and the friendship/bonds between the characters. Though the show was only 11 episodes long, I did wish it would have been longer. It did give a feel as if it was just a bit rushed, but even so, it’s still pretty good to watch. <br />

    Master Detective, NEET Ghost, Superpowers from items like what happens in Doraemon...<br />
<br />
and a main male character WITH BRAINS. Oh not to mention the very interesting plot.<br />
<br />
Ryuugajou Nana no Maizoukin is the first of its kind. I&#039;ve never seen anything like this. This is just so unique that I am literally amazed. WAIT WHY IS THE SALES SO BAD FOR THIS WHATS WRONG WITH THE JAPANESE ANIMERIANS GIVING IT SUCH A COLD TREATMENT?!<br />
<br />
Enough fanboying. Lets move on...<br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
The story was detailed, considering they pushed a whole lot of plot into a 11-episode series. Not to mention why the fxck is it only 11 episodes when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review155507">
        it should be longer. Story was unique, executed nicely and very interesting. However it is supposed to be a comedy, but the comedy part eventually tears off and this anime kind of became a mystery genre anime instead, with the comedy part heavily toned down to make way for the plot. If you are planning to look into comedy in the first place, you might be disappointed after a few episodes even though the first few episodes&#039; comedy was great. However, if you enjoyed things such as Hyouka then you kind of got a treasure by deciding to watch Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin.<br />
<br />
Another problem is that while the anime is listed as a Romance genre, it doesn&#039;t really contain anything romantic whatsover other than a few blushing scenes and so on. If you are looking into full romance, walk away.<br />
<br />
Art - 10/10<br />
The movement of the animation was really fluid and the character art design was great, everyone looked good, from the main characters to even the small casts such as the class monitor. What I am amazed about is firstly, everytime the cast encounters a &quot;ruin&quot;, the animation quality changes from Ryuugajou level to Guilty Crown level. It definitely gives off a vibe that is like &quot;Things are going to get serious now&quot; and makes me wonder how much money did they used for each ruin scene. Another thing worth noting is that the male mc, namely Yama Juugo&#039;s design is not exaggerated to be like some badass or some handsome idolic character, he looks just what he needed to look like - normal.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6/10<br />
The sound was the weakest part of the anime, not that I can expect anything from 11 episodes anyway. But still, I&#039;ve never even bothered to listen to the ED song and while the OP sounds catchy, it is probably easily forgotten in a few while. However Nanana&#039;s seiyu is awesome because she is only 17 years old yet she had the sound like Jibril from No Game No Life, probably even better. Be sure to look out for her work as she sounds real talented, at least to me.<br />
<br />
Character - 11/10 Director&#039;s cut<br />
Where&#039;d the world would u find a male mc with a brain, badass but not overly badass to not be beaten at all (like Izayoi from Mondaiji) and actually has motives in his own mind instead of the boring old &quot;I want to help because I am kind&quot; male mc? Here you have Yama Jugou, someone who was disowned by his father and came to the island where everything happens in the anime. You see him as a comic relief character and typical at first with looks that is easily forgettable, but once you start watching it you will realize that he has a working mind unlike most mc nowadays yet is not as OP as the ones i&#039;ve listed above. This is also the first time the male MC is not &quot;all good&quot; and instead has ulterior motives, although most of the part of the motive isn&#039;t bad either, he is really the first mc to be calculative, sneaky and can be wicked when he needs to be so. He may be badass when he needs to be, but he has a lot of weaknesses exploitable so that none of us will see him as OP (overpowered).<br />
<br />
Next up master detective Tensai-sama is our main brain power besides Juugo. She has the minds of a Sherlock Holmes (and the hat too, LOL) yet she&#039;s also calculative and sneaky that unlike most female characters that would &quot;lose their cool and sacrifice everything to save the male mc in trouble&quot;, she kept her cool and negotiated with the enemy to drive the enemy off using mindgames and to save the male mc at the same time, yet in the end you realize she is just bluffing without any way to win the enemy up front whatsover. That would be the point where you will be amazed by her intelligence and cool. Oh and she is really cute when she blushes (LOL) <br />
<br />
Nanana had really good design and is very cute, but due to her low character development she is probably easily forgettable, sadly. She is the neutral and the &quot;hint machine&quot; in this treasure hunting contest, yet she stays neutral however good she and Juugo&#039;s relationship may be.<br />
<br />
In short to conclude the characters: I&#039;ve never seen these kind of perfectly-balanced characters in my whole anime life.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9/10<br />
I&#039;ve really enjoyed the ride on Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin, but theres a few things that i&#039;ve looked for and are expecting but did not get them such as the romance between Juugo and Nanana/Tensai. Any of them is fine but I guess I need to use my imagination for this. Again if you are looking for romance, look away as you won&#039;t find a lot of it in this anime. However for character uniqueness and development, puzzle-solving. plot-twists and new strong anthologists that are not invincible yet strong to make you fear for the protagonists, look no further.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9/10<br />
Just copy paste the last paragraph here.

    First of all, as I was looking through all the series for the Spring 14 season, this series wasn&#039;t on my radar at first. It became sort of a throw in &quot;just because.&quot; But boy am I glad I decided to watch it!<br />
<br />
 A teen, Nanana, who was killed, is chained to a single room in an apartment complex for a school. She was part of a group that hunted down treasures that each had a special power and weakness. Only &quot;Adventure Club&quot; (whose sole purpose is to continue hunting down the treasures) members are allowed to live there with her. Juugo, who has many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147615">
        personal problems of his own, is enrolled at the school and is assigned that particular room. At first, their relationship was rather shaky, and really was only help together by the fact that she was a cute roommate. But, as the series progresses, you see their relationship expand, and Juugo puts his ego aside to help Nanana. Throw some villains, a master detective, and a few secret organizations (as well as other characters) into the fray, it makes for a very entertaining series.<br />
<br />
Not to spoil the series, the story is very good and pretty unique. It&#039;s sometimes hard to incorporate a &quot;ghost&quot; character into a series, but I feel as if this series did it very well. There is a ton of action, some romance, puzzles, a good amount of comedy, and even a tad bit of fanservice in there for you fanservice junkies.<br />
The art and sound are very solid. No real flaws. The soundtrack used is very enjoyable and fits the series very well. The animation style is slightly unique, and all the characters are crisply animated.<br />
The characters are very well developed for the most part. You don&#039;t get a ton of inter-character relationships until the later episodes. And at some points, you are left wondering what the connection is. But rest assured, you will get some answers. I like that romance wasn&#039;t a theme that was being forced down my throat, and the fanservice was not a major focal point of the series. <br />
The negatives- I was slightly confused at times with the relationships between some of the characters, given not much back story or flashbacks. Also, the length of the series. 11 episodes makes it slightly shorter, and may have caused the series to be rushed a tad bit. <br />
<br />
Overall, the series is extremely enjoyable and entertaining. It has very few negatives, and if you are looking for a series that has action, comedic moments, and not a typical run of the mill plot, you should definitely give this series a watch! <br />

    Bueno, that&#039;s it folks....unless there is a season 2. Enough of that, so another 2014 spring anime has ended and frankly I couldn&#039;t care less if it&#039;s only 11 episodes, so no more fucking around as I present my ratings for each of this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
<br />
Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Story- Ok, it is good but not good enough, since the plot itself was full of potholes that as larger as moon craters, now I can&#039;t imagine that a teeny bopper like Nanana would be able able to accumulate such riches through treasure hunting. Ok, so she has some help from her band called the &quot;Great 7,&quot;  so,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147571">
        I&#039;m guessing this is another one of them Japanese teens who have to grow up fast, but not that fast, If it were me I would made it that  Nanana got her treasure by through inheritance from her grand father who is a renowned adventurer , where 20% of the cache are magical artifacts and the rest where she was able to use to make more money and make her &quot;Nanana Island Project&quot; a reality, and here is the mystery.... she was murdered by someone in her family who wants those magic artifacts. So lets go to some of those potholes: <br />
<br />
<br />
Nanana&#039;s Collection- theoretically if she, together with her &quot;Great 7&quot; brat mates where able to gather them then by that time they would have been old farts already, or some of them would have died in search of those treasures.<br />
<br />
The murder of Nanana Ryūgajō- if the killer were to find out that Nanana was a ghost who can be seen by everyone then wouldn&#039;t that murderer try to go back and find out how a ghost like her was able to exist as if she is still alive? I&#039;m guessing that that round sphere around her neck is one of those so called collections, so if a killer was able to find that out, then he or she would either use some of the collections to counter it or blow up the entire apartment.<br />
<br />
Ruins- To put up ruins around the island would meant that there are maps or city plan designed that any would be treasure hunters would be able to find, the idea for such place to be in an island that has a modern metropolis is just very stupid, beside wouldn&#039;t the city administrator forbid such place to exist in the first place. It it were me, I wouldn&#039;t put those so called ruins in a modern metropolis, instead I would place it in one part of the island where it has a lot of old abandon buildings, warehouses and haunted houses.<br />
<br />
And there were a lot to mentioned that my fingers alone would get tired just by typing it, so with such potholes, there is really no doubt in my mind that this category should be &quot;Fair&quot; enough.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Good 7.<br />
<br />
Art- I like the art form where there isn&#039;t much fanservice for them pirreos to howl for, I also like the CGI that were done for the ruin effect.<br />
<br />
Sound- I like the opening theme, the closing, the VAs who did Nanana, Tensai and Daruku&#039;s voice.   <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- It is enjoyable enough and just like the other who were watching this anime I too fell more on the entertainment side of the anime, where I ignore the potholes that it has.<br />
<br />
<br />
Poor 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, nearly all of the characters here where somewhat have 2 conflicting side, ok,let&#039;s go with Juugo on one side he was suppose to be this student who was disowned by his father, ok so if that&#039;s the case why the fuck does he have to go to such faraway island where most of its population were compose of geniuses? There were also some plot twist where at first he didn&#039;t recognize Yukihime and Shu as his subordinate, remember the scene where Juugo was capture by the two latters in police uniforms. Another conflicting mystery about him was his interest with the so called &quot;Nanana Collection&quot; wher at one point we see him competing with his fellow &quot;Adventure Club&quot; mates, competing with his own subordinates and competing with his father, even if he did want to find who killed Nanana, there is still the feeling where he himself might have some selfish desire for the said collection. Nanana, about her, I&#039;d say that she is one big pothole of a character whether it is in anime or manga, now if she is the author&#039;s idea of a typical Japanese teen who should grow up fast, then that author really sucks, now I just have no idea what&#039;s going on inside Kazuma Ōtorino&#039;s mind as to why he made such character to be a big pothole, let&#039;s face it, unless she has a genie in the lamp as part of her collection, how can a young girl find so many treasure in a span of let&#039;s say a few months a be a billionaire immediately and be able to obtain artifacts with magical properties that quickly. Frankly, author  Kazuma Ōtorino wasn&#039;t really thinking about the potholes but rather he focuses more on the entertainment side of the character which is the reason why I gave this category a three. Tensai, ok her character I can forgive, but her sidekick Daruku....no way, wtf was going in the mind of the author for making him a trap? like EEEEEEEWWWWW!!!!! Now then let&#039;s go to the adventure&#039;s club, nearly what they are, what about them and what they stand for wasn&#039;t very clear, co&#039;z at one point they seem to be a bunch of greedy treasure hunters and on the other, they seem to be a bunch of adventurers.    <br />
<br />
<br />
Decent 4.<br />
<br />
Overall- It was ok to such point, but I just can&#039;t ignore the potholes and the plot twistes that this anime presents, but given that it was still entertain enough without much of the fanservice, I believe that such &quot;Decent&quot; score would be enough for this anime. <br />
<br />
<br />
Season 2????????????I&#039;d probably give a benefit of a doubt.     <br />

    This anime is like a short arc of a big series. The story and plot are really interesting but they are not completely described in these 11 episodes. Though I would&#039;ve loved if this anime got a sequel. It&#039;s an enjoyable anime, kinda like a &quot;just watch and go with it&quot; without worrying much about character developments, plot holes and event stories.<br />
Let&#039;s get with the review;<br />
<br />
Story 8/10:<br />
An island for students has several treasure items having special powers. They are called Nanana&#039;s Treasures since she was the one to find them. But Nanana is now dead and her ghost occupies the room of Yama Jugo, our

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179428">
        protagonist. Jugo aims to find Nanana&#039;s killer to help her pass on. Alongwith that, he and some friends and enemies are in the race to find all of Nanan&#039;s Hidden Treasures. Comedy goes hand in hand in each episode.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10:<br />
Not KyoAni but still pretty amazing. Almost all the characters were amazingly designed, even the side characters. Animation is one part of this anime that you will definitely enjoy. <br />
<br />
Sound 7/10:<br />
Not a fan of the opening or ending song.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10:<br />
Hmmmm, I really liked this anime but the characters leave a lot to be desired. First of all, this anime doesn&#039;t go into the past of the main characters. You don&#039;t get to know more about the characters in the anime i.e. their past, their relations and their motives. Neither are we told much about the island&#039;s past, the Great 7, The Three Skulls and many other important characters that are key to the story. This part may leave many disappointed but like I said before, these 11 episodes are similar to a short arc taken from a big story. If they were to explain each character in detail, it would make it a much bigger anime and a more interesting one. Though, it is good nonetheless but in the end, it leaves the watchers longing for more character info which kinda bums me out.<br />
<br />
As for the characters themselves, they are pretty cool. Some might be hated at the start but once their motives are cleared, you change your views about them. As for the protagonist, he has quite a hidden side which remains hidden from us as well but is shown in the anime from time to time. Side characters are also pretty decent e.g. the class rep. As for Nanana herself, she is pretty kawaii and quite an interesting and funny character.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10:<br />
It&#039;s my second time watching this anime and I must say, I was not bored. It&#039;s got nice comedy, quite a few eye candy and some nice characters that seem pretty cool. Let me make one thing clear, this is a supernatural comedy type anime. It is stated that is a romance anime but there isn&#039;t much romance aside from the occasional blushing scenes. So, don&#039;t expect much of a romance from this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, an enjoyable and interesting series to watch and leaves me demanding for a sequel which would be quite a joy. Do watch it if you like awesome animation, supernatural stuff and some kawaii characters.

    Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure is about an interesting set of characters living on an artificial island made into a lavish education environment by the genius girl Nanana. Set some years in the future Nanana is now dead, murdered by an unknown assailant and unable to move on to whatever lies beyond. She now “haunts” the room she was killed in, and offers the occasional hint to would be treasure hunters who want to find her “treasures”, rare items from around the world Nanana collected while alive to help fund the creation of the island, which she later hid in elaborate artificial dungeons apparently just for fun.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169321">
        <br />
<br />
Now a new generation of students on the island are after Nanana&#039;s treasures. Each has their own motivations, back stories, and bring their own set of talents to the hunt. They end up clashing with each other in interesting ways, and with veterans of the hunt they run into along the way. The focus is on our young hero who is quickly sucked into helping the ghost of Nanana find her killer after being tricked into renting the apartment she is still haunting. <br />
<br />
About the only criticism I have of the story is it felt a little rushed at 11 episodes. It is great that there is character development, it feels like most of the characters change in some significant way from their starting state, but with only 11 episodes to do it in some of the changes feel abrupt. Seems like there will be more however, so I can see myself rating any further editions higher if they bring the plot to a reasonable close and keep this pace of character development.<br />
<br />
I really feel like this series did a good job of mixing the ordinary, extraordinary, and fantastical. Yes, the characters are bad asses, particularly for high school students, but not so much you can&#039;t relate to them. Nanana is a ghost and her artifacts are magical, but they still have limits and weaknesses. All in all, I marathoned this in two sessions and would recommend the series to others. You&#039;ll find the art and music up to the usual standards, although nothing spectacular. It&#039;s really the story and characters that stand out here.

    What do a NEET ghost, a master detective, a cross-dressing maid, and buried treasure have in common? Well, they&#039;re all part of Yama Juugo&#039;s new life on Nanae Island.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure is an anime that deserves more praise than it gets. Colorful art and a fresh story bring a fantastic tale to the table. The characters personalities contrast beautifully with each other. The big issue is that the short, 11 episode series doesn&#039;t feel like a complete series in itself. We needed a longer time to be able to explore more ruins. The lore that&#039;s presented during the shows run, and the fantastic powers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188236">
        within the treasure needed more time. All in all, Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure is a must watch, if you like lighthearted fun, with a bit of drama and adventure.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
Yama Juugo is moving to an island made for students. He moves into an apartment, only to find a ghostly NEET girl with a love for pudding already there. With no money left to be able to move, Juugo decides to bare with it. He eventually learns that the ghost with unsettled business, Ryuugajou Nanana, is one of the island&#039;s founders, as well as an esteemed adventurer with her magical treasures hidden around the island.<br />
<br />
Sounds kinda weird, huh? With such a creative and new concept, this Spring 2014 anime brought an amazing adventure to the season. The story is interesting and complex. Different twists pop up throughout the series, keeping you locked into the anime.<br />
<br />
Only problem is, the series end doesn&#039;t bring any closure. It feels like an arc, lacking a bigger story.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure&#039;s island setting  gives it the perfect spot for gorgeous artwork. Sadly, the story doesn&#039;t allow for much of that, as it mostly takes place in the city. Backgrounds still look nice, and character designs are lovely. Especially the eyes. Beautiful eyes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
Sound is average, nothing special to it. Opening theme is fun and catchy.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure is full of lively and colorful characters. Nanana, the great adventurer turned NEET ghost, Tensai, the genius teenage master detective, Daruku, a maid who serves as Tensai&#039;s sidekick (and is actually a boy), and Juugo. Oh Juugo.<br />
<br />
Yama Juugo is the main protagonist of the anime. Juugo is a fairly complicated individual, from a shady background. Not only is he in top physical condition, but for once, we have a smart main character. Decently smart at least. Juugo is a great example for other anime protagonists. Be a Yama Juugo!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure was a lot of fun to watch. It always kept me interested. Comedy, mystery, and drama, all wrapped up into one, small, 11 episode package.

    Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin, It piqued my interest because of the Phantasy Star cameos on it. But it really wasn&#039;t a bad idea to watch it. So let&#039;s get on with my review, shall we?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story : 8<br />
The story starts with three high school girls running into a cave chuck full of traps. Okay... That was the first scene. Anyway, the story&#039;s about Rugajou Nanana playing Phantasy Star Online 2. Jk. Jokes aside, we have Yama Juugo as our MC, a sixteen-year old kid who stumbled into Nanae Island, a man-made island somewhere in the Pacific. Apparently, he was exiled from his household and ends up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148485">
        in a weird situation(as if shounen MC&#039;s don&#039;t run into &#039;em oftenly). He founds a cheap apartment, but someone&#039;s already living in it, well, not an alive human being, though. Ryuugajou Nanana, a girl who was killed and now trapped in Juugo&#039;s room. She can&#039;t pass on unless someone finds the one responsible for her death. Juugo decides to find who the culprit is to help Nanana pass on. And he discovers that Nanana was one of the seven high-school students(then) who made Nanae island, and the fact that Nanana had hidden lots of treasure within the island. The treasures are a lot valuable; most of them possess mysterious powers. So obviously, a lot of who-knows-who would try to collect them. Juugo needs to collect the treasures in order to find clues about Nanana&#039;s killer. So Juugo decides to join the Adventure club on his school, a club entirely focused on collecting Nanana&#039;s treasures.<br />
<br />
Art : 8<br />
Decent art, no flaws or whatsoever. Detailed backgrounds. It&#039;s 2014, having stupid art decreases your viewers by an average of 50%. Jk. Nothing much to tell here.<br />
<br />
Characters : 7<br />
Characters here are good. Although, where they came from or how they can do something like this or that weren&#039;t confirmed. Since there&#039;s thousands of series made already, it&#039;s almost impossible to have an original character now(in terms of look). In Yuugo&#039;s case, he doesn&#039;t differ that much from the other shounen MC&#039;s out there. What confuses me is about his past. In the past he said he wanted to help all the people in the world. But presently in the story, he always say he doesn&#039;t want to help people. It&#039;s confusing. I wish they&#039;d confirm how really Juugo feels like(if they make a sequel). Of course, how can I forget about our Loli detective Tensai-chwan?! She resembles a lot like Taiga, but she&#039;s blonde. She figures the most complicated things in just a snap of a finger, nothing less from our Loli detective. We&#039;ve got a trap too, guess who he is when you watch the show.<br />
<br />
Music : 6<br />
Didn&#039;t like it that much. Nothing else.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 7<br />
I&#039;m not a fan of mystery solving shows. In Ryuugajou&#039;s case, it involves a bit of highly difficult puzzles only the characters in-show can solve. Quite the logic, no? And being with only 11 episodes, the puzzles are solved within 5 minutes by our resident loli-master detective Tensai-chwaaaaan. The first few episodes were confusing as heck, it&#039;s kinda hard getting your grip into Ryuugajou&#039;s boo-- I meant plot. But you&#039;ll definitely enjoy the last few episodes. Not the anti-climatic finish to it, though. =|<br />
<br />
Overall : 8<br />
Ryuugajou might look like it&#039;s your ordinary harem rom-com series, but trust me, it ain&#039;t one. It seems comical at times, though. And it contains a little bit of romance in it. But the plot&#039;s not originally about a guy being flocked by girls. It&#039;s much more than that. Although the series was short, it didn&#039;t waste my time. In fact, I was amused how the story progressed. Some scenes will make you scratch your head, though. The lack of background stories among characters kinda put me off, too. They&#039;d just throw you a thing and won&#039;t say a thing on how to use it. Genius, eh? I can&#039;t blame them, though. With just 11 episodes, it&#039;s really hard cramping all of &#039;em side stories on it. Heck, even 20+ series are having a hard time doing it. To be exact, Ryuugajou has potential being great if it continues to follow the action path. If they decide to put another season into it and focus on the things they&#039;ve missed this season, they might make it big. And maybe because of the anti-climatic ending, some even hated the series. I myself became pissed momentarily. But I think it&#039;s all for the good of the series. Overall, Ryuugajou&#039;s boo-- I mean plot is good, following it with a much more serious sequel will be great. Therefore, I conclude, my review is finished.<br />

    Nanana&#039;a Buried Treasure is a short series that takes the audience on a peculiar roller-coaster ride. It begins with the central protagonist, Juugo Yama, moving into an apartment occupied by a lingering ghost Nanana Ryuugajou. She enjoys playing video games, eating pudding, and being very enigmatic to her true interests. After wrestling with Nanana and finding out she was murdered, Juugo vows to find her murderer so she can find peace. <br />
<br />
The plot center&#039;s on Juugo&#039;s accumulation of &quot;friends&quot; and the solving of different puzzles for items that possess considerable (if not conditional) powers. Juugo hopes to use Nanana&#039;s treasure to piece together the clues

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147667">
        to her untimely death. <br />
<br />
Due to its brevity, the series suffers from trying to do too much per episode. It lacks an interesting plot, and possesses minimal character development. Episodes typically involve introducing supporting characters and a new puzzle, while sprinkling in a few jokes. This is not to say the series is not enjoyable.Despite its noticeable flaws, Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure is capable of capturing the audience&#039;s sense of adventure and curiosity enough to finish the series without regret.<br />
<br />
The characters are the biggest problem with the show.The antagonists are not necessarily clear, often too quickly (easily) switching sides. The fan-pandering, while not in your face, is similar to an alarm clock going off every 10 or 15 minutes. It is not incredibly irksome, but every so often it manifests and dilutes the quality of the episode. For example, Tensai Ikkyuu the aspirational detective, possess an assistant that is both useless and incompetent. Her assistant is a boy who dresses up as a maid (for reasons unknown) and unlike Dr. Watson, does not compliment Tensai&#039;s inductive reasoning skills at all. He(She) clearly exist only to satisfy some target market&#039;s fetish.<br />
<br />
The rest of the supporting case equally lacks much purpose aside from Yukihime. She acts not only as a concerned elder sister-figure, but clearly has a deeper level of romantic feeling with Juugo. Even though later it is revealed that many of the characters have additional motives, they lack much complexity or elaboration to stir additional intrigue for the audience. While Juugo possesses a bit of a selfishness streak, he never really breaks the mold of the cookie cutter &quot;just a good guy doing stuff because it&#039;s right&quot; archetype. The female lead Nanana, while a charming character, does not get enough screen time. Her interactions with Juugo were always unpredictable and stirred some interest in the plot. As the series gets past the halfway mark, even the lead antagonist never evolves beyond the prototypical bad guy that only who seeks power.<br />
<br />
While the supporting cast is lackluster, the art and character design of the series is superb. This might be largely due to the series being short and having a higher than typical allocated budget per episode. Regardless, the art and animation is stellar, with no noticeable drop-off in the later episodes. Visually, the show is one of the better anime series this Spring season. <br />
<br />
The sound and voice acting is also good, with the character&#039;s design matching the overall actor&#039;s voice. Line delivery is energetic, despite average writing. The music is slight quirky, but it matches the show&#039;s overall tone and is relatively pleasant. <br />
<br />
Overall, Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure is a decent show, with only one or two episodes that could have had better execution. The show never becomes unpleasant to watch, despite the obvious fetish pandering. The show manages to remain fun throughout and is worth a viewing, despite low re-watch value.

    Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure is a type of adventure anime that seems to mix together several different genres together to make a kind of unique package<br />
<br />
<br />
On the surface the story is about how Juugo moves into a dorm where Nanana lives. However, she is a ghost who is searching for her killer. She has hidden the treasure she has gathered in her life time around the city and Juugo is tracking them down to help her achieve her goal. However, fairly early on there is a major twist in the anime that does take time to get used to, but ultimately raises the stakes.<br />
<br />
However, the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190980">
        does not go very far in the 11 episodes the show has. The ending does not even fall on a spot where there is some closure and the pacing is off balanced due to the number of reveals the show commits to. The anime is very fast paced overall and a lot of the transitions seem a bit jarring. Even so, it does remain interesting throughout.<br />
<br />
The characters are somewhat of a mixed bag. Juugo, for a male protagonist, is actually pretty well rounded. He clearly likes girls, but is actually focused on his goals. Also, while he is quick to protect people, he is not against venting his annoyances. He&#039;s pretty realistic personality wise as far as anime goes. But he also has no real major strengths either besides being somewhat refreshing.<br />
<br />
Nanana, the title character, has some interesting past but none of it is explored during the show. She gets no development and it&#039;s even questionable to call her a main character as her involvement overall is fairly limited. She is likable enough, but again, not very special. However, then we get to Tensai, the true hero of the anime. She claims to be a master detective and while this seems like a bogus claim at first, she actually makes good on her claim. She&#039;s most likely among the smartest and most cunning of the cast and it contrasts pretty well with the rest of the cast.<br />
<br />
There are of course a lot of side characters. A couple of them get some backstory and development, but nothing very major at all. A lot of the characters really seem to be moving from point A to B to get to a treasure using various means.<br />
<br />
One of the most exciting parts of the anime are the treasure rooms. They are huge puzzles the characters must solve to get to the treasure, and they all can be deadly. It&#039;s very much akin to Phi-Brain, but the animation and characters make it more enjoyable. When they get to one it&#039;s almost like the anime telling you this is going to be pretty awesome<br />
<br />
From an animation standard it has it&#039;s own flare to say the least. However, a lot of the characters just seem to blend into each other after a while. The only ones with really distinctive styles are Nanana and Tensai, and the latter is more due to her outfit than anything else. However, that is not to say the animation is bad... it&#039;s actually quite solid. The sound is kind of weird for the anime overall, I mean the OP and ED are both solid and imo fit the show a lot better than some of the IN tracks.<br />
<br />
Nanana might have hidden a true ending away somewhere but it&#039;s not to be found in eleven episodes. I know this is a broken record but this anime honestly did the best it could with such limited time. However, making it all come together was an unsolvable puzzle.

    In all honesty, the synopsis didn&#039;t leave me with much to expect. However, I decided to give this anime a go and it was overall very good.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story was great. It was one of those animes that makes you want to keep watching no matter what time it is, whether it be 1 am or 10 pm, you just want to keep watching. The ending of each episode is also very good because it leaves you with a cliff hanger making you want to watch more and more and more...<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
This art was one of the factors in the show that got me into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152893">
        it. I watched the first episode and the story was one part that interested me but the fact that the art was excellent made me want to watch it that much more. The art is overall very bright colored and cheerful with a lot of detail.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The sounds weren&#039;t spectacular but they were still good. They fit what the producers were trying to get at but nothing too extraordinary.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
The characters at first started out a little shady with very little background for each of them. However, the show did give most of the main characters a decent amount of back story other than maybe Tensai and the &quot;girl&quot; next to her... The characters were very enjoyable overall.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I definitely thought this anime was worth the watch. The story was captivating and the way it was executed was nicely done.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
This was a good anime overall. I just wished that it was longer... The ending was nothing short of an excellent cliff hanger. If you&#039;re ever feeling down, watching this anime because it will put you in a good mood, with all the factors like the characters, story, and the art.

    Despite the title being Nanana, the show mainly focuses to Yama Juugo, who just moved in to a room with a very cheap rent. Well, it was cheap for a reason, it seems there&#039;s a ghost girl that comes with it as a bonus. The ghost&#039;s name is Nanana Ryuugajou, who was murdered and It seems her treasures are somehow related to the culprit. Now, it&#039;s Juugos job to find who did that to her by finding the treasures! Sounds fun? Well, it is.<br />
<br />
This show is unique for it&#039;s timeslot, Noitamina.,who is known for having unique series such as Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149963">
        AnoHana. Their target demographic ranges from young adults to adults. So this is new for them since the genre of this series is shonen( young boys) and a light novel to add on that. Don&#039;t mistake me, I&#039;m all for experimentations. It seems Noitamina is losing to it&#039;s competitor, Animeism. So how did they do? Not really that good.<br />
<br />
The plot is unique, as well as the setting but what really took the cake was the ruins. It was really planned out. Though the anime, didn&#039;t really do justice on that. (Some ruins are based of concepts but due to time restraints they didnt bother explaining how they solved that.)<br />
<br />
The animation is your typical A1 production, Crisp and smooth. The series is notable for its fight scenes (although pretty short!) and there are some hiccups some (they look constipated). There are some uncanny CGs but nothing really to write about.The BG&#039;s are well conceptualized(specially the ruins and the buildings in the island). All through out, a pretty well- budgeted show.<br />
<br />
Music was okay. The upbeat opening and the ending was suitable for a wacky treasure hunting series like this. The BGM did fine setting the mood of some scenes(ruins part) but some are just plain ridiculous (do your job properly, sound director!)<br />
<br />
The characters in this show is…. stereotypical aside from the Juugo( you&#039;ll see what I mean) and Tensai(not being bias here). You&#039;ll notice it when you see them their character is based from what they look like but weirdly it somehow works. But what really ticked me off was unfortunately the title girl herself, Nanana. She&#039;s really unlikeable. And her liking pudding and video games to give her personality is not really working. In the first episode, she asks Juugo to a fight so they can decide who can be the king of the room (which is supposed to be Juugo in the first place since he&#039;s the one paying the rent and necessities). Sure, that seems fair, oh wait. She&#039;s a ghost. Instaloss right there bud. Heck, without that I can&#039;t imagine how Juugo manages to stay a day with her. Despite those(her), the show makes up for it&#039;s unique stories and twists.<br />
<br />
The hard thing for Noitamina shows are they&#039;re always 11 episodes, which can be a double -edged sword. Unfortunately, it didnt work out here.<br />
<br />
All in all, the series is enjoyable and wacky suitable for its plot, treasure hunting.

    &quot;Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin&quot; is a story about a ghost girl, named Nanana Ryuugajou. She was killed in her apartment  room 10 years ago, when she was still a teenager.<br />
Unable to move on from her own death, Nanana is stuck living in that apartment room, only able to eat pudding and play video games, until she kills her murderer.<br />
<br />
Story : 9<br />
The story is one of the strongest points in this anime. It has many plot twists, it has hints of romance, it has so much of everything. Because it&#039;s a little bit short, missing just a minute of the episode could be fatal for

Overall the story is pretty original and balanced for today&#039;s viewers.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The art and animation are some things you should definetly like. It&#039;s simple, but not too simple.<br />
The puzzle scenes inside the anime look definetly amazing, but it&#039;s not overdone.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
For my personal opinion I liked both the opening and the ending, but the ending a little bit more.<br />
As for the background music, I think it really set the tone on dramatic scenes, as well as on funny scenes. The music for every other scene mostly is cheerful and heart-warming like this show is.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
This is where the anime came up a bit short. The main characters remained mysterious for me until the end. The main protagonist was pictured as good, then bad and then again as good. It missed history &quot;from back then&quot; and that&#039;s where it came short.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 9<br />
I enjoyed the show very much, even though it was pretty hard to follow the story at times, I was happy to be watching this show and not something else.<br />
<br />
Overall : 8<br />
The show overall was interesting, mysterious, at times funny, at times sad. Many questions still remained unanswered and I hope there will be some continuation for the show. <br />
But if being straightforward, it was a very good show and I would recommend everyone to watch it. <br />

    So, Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin (or Nanana&#039;s Buried Treasure) came to its climax just yesterday  so I thought I&#039;d review it.<br />
So let&#039;s just jump straight in there!<br />
<br />
Story - 8/10.<br />
Nanana, a girl who was murdered 10 years before our story, was collecting treasures with particular powers (known as &#039;Nanana&#039;s collection&#039;) on Nanae Island. She is currently bound to the room she was murdered in, which is where Yama Juugo comes in - he is assigned to this room, which sets us up for his adventures to find the Nanana&#039;s collection treasures.<br />
A decently original idea, told pretty well - the show had plenty of running gags,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147765">
        some got old quickly and some remained pretty funny (at least for me), sometimes it was unnecessary but most of the time, when it needed to be, there was a more serious feel.<br />
So the story basically revolves around Juugo&#039;s quest to find Nanana&#039;s collection and the adventures he has during that search and the people he consequently meets.<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10.<br />
Although the character design was nothing hugely original, and the style quite common of contemporary anime, it was animated well nonetheless. The scenes were set pretty well, especially those in the ruins (which is where Nanana had hidden the treasures from her collection). Each ruins was different and had a unique style to it which was interesting to behold.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10.<br />
To be honest, as with most anime I watch, unless it&#039;s outstandingly atmospheric the music in the background is mostly just more of a scene-setter, so I don&#039;t notice it unless it stands out - I don&#039;t remember thinking any of the sounds were out of place or anything but nothing outstanding. The scene was set by sounds well when it came to the ruins though, I thought.<br />
The voice acting was pretty on-par, nothing really stood out to me though. Emotions were portrayed pretty accurately and it didn&#039;t make me feel like it was being forced, which is always a plus.<br />
The OP set us up for a nice relatively light-hearted episode of adventure and fun which was fitting.<br />
<br />
Character - 7/10.<br />
Nothing hugely original in the character department. You have your main male and female leads and the Adventure Club (mostly).<br />
Juugo is a pretty standard perverted male protagonist, though his development especially in his relationship with Nanana is portrayed well - at first they merely tolerate one another but their relationship develops quite well throughout the series. Nanana is a little unusual of a character - she&#039;s a ghost, but she&#039;s not the standard vengeful type - instead, she has NEET tendencies and loves pudding. As previously stated her relationship with Juugo develops quite nicely throughout the series as they come to harmonise more with one another.<br />
Tensai is a character I couldn&#039;t really stomach. Although she was admittedly clever and helpful, she was pretty far up her own ass, so it was hard to appreciate what she was doing as more than a way to confirm her own opinion of herself. She had a couple of tender moments but for the most part I didn&#039;t really enjoy her tsundere-ish tendencies.<br />
Daruku was a token trap, and the source of the majority of the running gags in the show (along with Juugo&#039;s pervertedness). Doesn&#039;t really play much of a role in the show other than to provide aforementioned gags, so I didn&#039;t find he/she added much to the story.<br />
Other than that, the antagonist is worth a mention though he only appears in the latter few episodes, he spices things up a little.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8/10.<br />
Though this series was short, it was decent overall and I did enjoy watching it every week to see what our characters would get up to. The ending left quite a lot to be desired, though, and no loose ends were really tired - this gives rise to the question of another season.

    When i first came across this i was not expecting to add it to my spring anime list, but i saw it and it caught my eye, or maybe i just wanted to watch some more anime that night, so i watched it and i definitely added it onto my list. <br />
<br />
The storyline of this anime was definitely its weak point for me. It didnt seem consistent to me at all, it would keep jumping from story to story without ever really finishing anything up ( maybe they are saving to tell everything in a second season??) but the story was actually decent the pacing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147939">
        was nice, but still kind of jumped around it seemed like.<br />
<br />
The characters in this anime were for the most part likeable and fun. Yama juugo was my favorite character, had a nice sense of humour, never wanted his ego to get the better of him, always tries his best to help out someone in need, and was not your typical &quot;over powerful, over whatever&quot; kind of guy, was just an average jock looking for an apartment and got one with a ghost inside, nanana i thought needed more screen time personally, i thought she was an interesting character but didnt get much development, tensai was also a very cool and interesting character (maybe jugos love interest??) but she was very smart in figuring everything out and wasent annoying like most other heorines (i think i spelled that right), and there are many more good characters in the show you just have to watch it.<br />
<br />
I was in love with the openings and endings, the songs were a perfect fit for the show and didnt spoil anything like every shounen anime does, and the sound in the anime was nice too.<br />
<br />
Animations were also very well done, very fluid, good art on the characters. Overall it had the shiny look and appeal on the characters. <br />
<br />
Overall i really enjoyed this series, had quite a few laughs, even some intense feels, some romance here and there, evil schemes, superpowers, just a great show. I was very sad to see it end at the last episode (which is a very good ending episode IMO)<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this! You will have to watch it to know more!

Art: 9<br />
The art was fairly standard character wise for an anime but I found the eyes to be a big feature as they are very colour and have a large range in colour which looks quite nice. Also the animation when they find a treasure when the room changes is very nice and looks extremely well done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The OST is well done and each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147563">
        track fits well into each scene that it is placed in without it feeling out place, the opening song is a really good fit for the show as it has an upbeat feeling which fits the theme of the show as well as not spoiling anything in the opening and is fun to watch. Equally the ending has a nice feel to it but does not quite match up to the op but is equally as good in song choice.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
The characters to follow some of the basic types like Tensai=Tsundere and Yugihime=Yandere, but I felt the rest of the characters were a bit more unique as well as some un expecting traps in it, such as Juugo has the appearance of a support character which is un expecting as it feels odd but is refreshing from the spiky haired or depressed characters in most anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I enjoyed it as it was fun, interesting and funny, I loved the trials they had to take to get the treasure as well as how the characters interacted with each other.<br />
<br />
Actual Score: 8.8

    So having just completed the season a few minutes ago I feel like I might as well throw this out there. This&#039;ll be a spoiler free review.<br />
<br />
So I started into Nanana about two thirds of the way through the season, just after episode 7 had aired. I had put it on my to-watch earlier but only recently got around to watching it, and damn it was worth it. This is one of those shows that isn&#039;t particularly amazing at any one aspect, but all of the component parts are well-enough executed that it results in an overall enjoyable experience. This is not as over the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147561">
        top as Gurren Lagann, or emotionally powerful as AnoHana, or a masterpiece of storytelling like FMA Brotherhood. What it is is a damn fun series that manages to tell a pretty good story with some action and emotional moments thrown in for good measure.<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10 - The story you&#039;re going to find here is nothing incredibly new, although there are elements that make it a little bit more fresh feeling than other shows. Nanana is bound to her room after being killed there ten years ago, and now serves as a sort of guide to the people hunting ruins around the island. On a basic level this serves a lot like the video games Nanana loves so much - the characters are sent on a series of fetch quest-style missions to find the ruins and recover the artifacts. Initially it&#039;s pretty straightforward, but over the course of the story several points of conflict are encountered, which I want to point out is really nice. This is not s straightforward story. There are several parties in play, all with their own motivations, and they&#039;re represented to a point where you begin to see the MC Juugo as a protagonist - not a good guy, a protagonist. There is not really a clear &quot;bad guy&quot; until later in the story. Having these shifting points of conflict allows the show to shift focus without feeling too scattered, although I did drop my score some because it is confusing for the first few episodes until things start to tie together. There&#039;s good resolution in the story thanks for the most part to the main character, but I&#039;ll address that in a bit.<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10 - The style of Nanana really appeals to me. It&#039;s colorful, nothing feels too bland, and what limited use of CG there is is perfectly acceptable. I particularly like the style of the eyes that the characters have, which initially seems like kind of an odd thing to focus on, but it gives the show its own sort of uniqueness. They&#039;re not as unique as, say, Katanagatari, but each character has their own thing going on in the ocular department, which is nice. The character designs are solid and feel fitting enough, and there&#039;s some decent variation thrown in there. Juugo Yama isn&#039;t much more than a standard brown-haired protag, but that&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10 - There&#039;s nothing really new being done here in terms of sound, but it&#039;s certainly not bad. If anything, I was at least able to focus on the other aspects of the show instead of getting thrown off by the sound. The voice acting is all pretty good, and we have a HanaKana trap thrown in there for good measure, so that&#039;s cool. Tensai in particular is great and demonstrates some good emotional range.<br />
<br />
Character - 8/10 - The characters are what really make this show for me. They&#039;re not shining examples of depth, but they&#039;re not shallow and dismissable either. There&#039;s some fun and really likable characters here, particularly Tensai, Juugo, Nanana, and Kagetora (who gets robbed of screentime in my opinion, but what&#039;s there is good). I didn&#039;t come out of this show hating any one of the characters, which is great. Yama Juugo in particular is nice. There&#039;s been an influx of characters lately who aren&#039;t as dense as a fucking neutron star and actually talk about problems that arise, and it&#039;s a Godsend, I tell ya. Juugo does not beat around the bush. He does not spend three episodes brooding over a misunderstanding. He attacks problems head-on, discusses things with the people he has issues with, and it serves as a great source of resolution throughout the story. Tensai as well is pretty much the most likable character this season, short of Kaori Fujimiya from Isshuukan Friends, but that&#039;s another matter (ain&#039;t nobody can touch Kaori when it comes to likability). Every damn time she shows up you know shit is going to get good. She&#039;s analytical and intelligent without being cold - she&#039;s not a Sherlock Holmes, cursed with intelligence - she&#039;s just good, and still has some emotional depth instead of being an &quot;aloof genius&quot; type.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10/10 - I really like this show. I REALLY like this show. It has its flaws, don&#039;t get me wrong, but damn if I don&#039;t love it. Enjoyment is the first thing I take into account when watching a show, and while I love literary masterpieces just as much as the next guy, sometimes you just need some fun, and Nanana provides that in spades. Remember playing an RPG where you always started out with fetch quests, and how much you hated them? But as the game progressed, and you got into story and exposition-heavy missions that you pretty much just skipped through, and found yourself wishing more and more for just a good ol&#039; fetch quest? Ryougajou Nanana no Maizoukin is that blessed fetch quest that pops up and lets your enjoy the simple pleasure of smacking a few rats with your gigantic club once again.

    Nanana&#039;s treasure, as i like to call it, is an episodic adventure Anime, which has a lot of fantastic and sci-fi elements. It is about a teenage girl, which has the desire of building an utopic city for young people, in the which you can achieve your very own (non-sexual)  dreams and projects, no matter what they are.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that i have not read the novel or manga or whatever it is adapted from.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
Although the setup was fantastic for my taste, the way it develops could have been much better and mature. Yes, I seriously felt like I was watching an anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review157885">
        for kids, or at least people younger than myself, being awkward at times. However, when i came to think of it, these were the elements that help you inmerse yourself into the adventure. I still found them a little cheesy, tho.<br />
<br />
There are also elements that appear just out of nowhere, or at least they are not explained in a correct way. The way the &quot;mysteries&quot; are solved could have been more interactive at times. I seriously felt &#039;this&#039; character as it was meant to outsmart the viewer, by not letting anyone see the key clues or observations made to solve the mysteries. <br />
<br />
The plot progress also lacks direction/focus, and sometimes felt it as it has an identity crisis. It does not know what it wants to achieve.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
The backgrounds are fantastic, and everything, included the characters and even buildings are just full of life, at least from outside. The lack of life indoors gives you that feel of wanting to go outside and go for them adventures :D At least, that&#039;s the way I saw it.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters design, I found some mixed feelings. The females, as you may expect, are all meant to be seen as hot, or at least really cute and eye-candy. Face expressions are also well detailed. The men, however, are pretty much plain and dull. Due to this, I unconciously saw them as less important than the female cast. Of course, our male lead is the only excepction.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
Everything was fine. Nothing special.<br />
<br />
I usually skip Openings and Endings, because I do not care about them.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
<br />
Most of the characters were entertaining and likable. Of course there are exceptions. <br />
<br />
Somehow, I could not quite take any of the characters seriously. They are way too exaggerated for my taste, and their abilities were waaaaaay over the top. I know that you are not meant to relate to them in any way, but the whole cast of this anime was one of the elements that make you go &quot;No way&quot; every 5 seconds, but not in a positive shocking way, but more of a &quot;There&#039;s no way this is remotely possible&quot;. You will take your inner physics snob out.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
Although I enjoyed this quite a lot, I often felt like I didn&#039;t know what I was watching. Specially at the &quot;plot twist&quot; at the last few episodes. It&#039;s like a nerd going to a club. Everything just feels out of place.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
I am terribly sorry that I kinda have to give this score to this anime, because I liked it.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, the setup is so amazing, but it could have been handled better. There was just no impact.<br />

    Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin is an ongoing light novel and manga series by Otorino Kazuma. Both manga and light novel series began publication in early 2012. In 2014 our old friends at A-1 pictures worked on an eleven episode anime version. I haven&#039;t read the novels or manga, so I won&#039;t be able to tell you how well the anime series follows either of them. I will, however, tell you how well it stands as its own entity. With that in mind, let&#039;s delve into it. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Our protagonist, young Yama Juugo, moves to the man-made Nanae Island after being disowned by his father. Once there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221524">
        he finds a low rent apartment, but there turns out to be a catch. It&#039;s haunted. The ghost is Nanana, that isn&#039;t a lead up to saying &#039;Batman&#039; it&#039;s actually her name, one of the island&#039;s founders. Ten years ago she was murdered in her room and she&#039;s been bound to it since. Juugo is approached by his High School&#039;s Adventure Club. A group dedicated to finding Nanana&#039;s collection, a group of artefacts with magic powers. He joins them, hoping to find something to help him solve Nanana&#039;s murder. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s open with the issues I had with the narrative. The first is that it&#039;s a bit inconsistent. To name a big example, Nanana mentions that she was killed from behind and didn&#039;t see her attacker, but she somehow knows they had a dragon tattoo on their neck. How exactly did she manage to see their neck and nothing else? You&#039;d think she could at least also give a hair colour, description of their back and be able to tell roughly how tall they were. The tone also shifts a bit. Most of it is more light-hearted and kind of goofy, but they also try to throw in some more serious moments and they don&#039;t transition well betwixt the two, resulting in a lack of investment in the serious scenes. I took it more seriously when Q threw the elements of harmony into chaos and that was a program for small children. My final issue was with the ending. I understand that it&#039;s difficult to end a single series when there&#039;s more to the story. You want some closure, but you also want to keep things open enough to get the audience interested in the continuation. In this case, they try to do it with a climactic battle against an antagonist they&#039;ve built up and with Nanana&#039;s murder still unsolved. However, the execution is pretty weak and the battle ends with a total anti-climax. <br />
<br />
On the positive side, the premise is an interesting one. The comedic elements are handled decently enough. I also do like that they play Nanana up as a neutral party and not as a being who&#039;s only helpful to the main group. As a consequence, you can&#039;t say that they only clear ruins ahead of other treasure hunters due to supernatural assistance. <br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
<br />
The characters in this aren&#039;t badly done, but they also aren&#039;t incredibly complex, compelling or funny. All in all, they&#039;re pretty standard. That being said, I did rather like Tensai. She can be quite fun. What I didn&#039;t like are the relationship dynamics. They&#039;re incredibly stilted. There&#039;s a moment where certain characters betray others, there&#039;s a fight and then everyone goes back to being the bestest of friends. Because that seems like what would happen in that situation. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art is okay. It&#039;s mostly pretty standard with some nice effects and designs for the ruins. A bit of fan-service, mostly involving an effeminate male character. So, that&#039;s different. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting in this is fine. It&#039;s not anything special but it&#039;s competent enough. The music is done by Hoashi Keigo, who also did work on Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu. The music here isn&#039;t as good, but it&#039;s all right. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a little bit. Some of the other boys demonstrate attraction to our fan-servicey effeminate boy. So, there&#039;s that. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin. There are some aspects that are decent, some that are kind of weak but, by and large, it&#039;s just an average series. If you really like the sound of the premise, you may like it and it&#039;s only eleven episodes, so it wouldn&#039;t be a huge time investment to try it. As for me, my rating is going to be a 5/10. Next week I&#039;m looking at Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever.
