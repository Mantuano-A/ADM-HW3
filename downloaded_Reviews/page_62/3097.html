    After watching the whole series in just two weeks or so, I will tell you how I felt about this series. I watched the orignal Japanese version, not the English dubbed version (although I&#039;ve watched some on TV).<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh! GX is a sequel of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series as most would know. The game of Duel Monsters has gotten so popular that there are pro leagues as well as specialized schools to mainly train and teach students to become great duelists. It&#039;s an interesting setting and did intrigue me.<br />
<br />
The story follows after a young boy named Yuki Judai, who just starts to attend an elite Duel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16753">
        Monsters school called, &quot;Duel Academia&quot; The school is divided in three different classes, &quot;Obelisk Blue&quot;, &quot;Ra Yellow&quot; and &quot;Osiris Red&quot; (the names should sound familiar for those who watched the original series). It is basically dividing students into their skill levels, Osiris Red being the lowest class, Ra Yellow in the middle and the Obelisk Blue, consisting of the school&#039;s best duelists.<br />
<br />
The series starts off with a lighter tone, just following Judai and his life in school as he makes new friends. But as the story progresses, it does get deeper and more complex. I felt that there were quite a few story elements that seemed forced and didn&#039;t make sense, but it was watchable overall. Much like the original series, there&#039;s heavy emphasis on friendship. One thing that does get a little annoying is that duelists read their card effects every time they play it and it kind of gets tiresome, but I guess they can&#039;t help it since there will always be people who aren&#039;t familiar with the cards and their effects.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t super impressed with most of OP and ED songs, but soundtracks were quite good, although I would have liked a little more variety of music during duels. It&#039;s like when you hear a certain music starts to play, you know that our hero&#039;s pulling off an awesome combo to finish the duel!<br />
<br />
Art wise, I felt that GX got a slight down grade from the original series. Not a big difference, but I never thought that GX had better animation or art quality. Not the worst, but not too impressive on most parts. However, I never expected it to be amazing since it is a 180 episode series afterall.<br />
<br />
There are quite a bit of characters in GX and I felt that there were perhaps a little too many. Character developments are there, as it would be crazy to have a 180 episode series without character growths. Some character developments being more natural and subtle than others. The series inserts new characters here and there to keep it interesting, but it felt a bit crowded later on.<br />
<br />
I mainly watched this because I play the card game myself. It will be much more enjoyable if you play the game. It does gets kind of repetitive, but that could be because I was having a marathon (almost). The TV series is very different from the manga, so give it a read! I personally like the overall feel of the manga more, because the manga has more mature feel to it. <br />
<br />
Basically, this series is worth a watch for someone who:<br />
- plays, or is interested in the card game<br />
- wants to kill some time<br />
- is looking for something to watch with his/her kid<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX was a decent series, but it was never at the level of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series.

    I&#039;m not sure exactly why so many see GX as the weakest of the Yu-Gi-Oh anime series, as I thoroughly enjoyed it, and continue to do so no matter how many times I watch it. GX has a strong cast of characters with terrific voice actors, excellent back-ground music, and an interesting setting and storyline. I&#039;ll admit that the storyline is a bit shakey at times and contains gaps, but that is also true of the other Yu-Gi-Oh series. In my opinion, GX contains far more comprehensive character development than the other Yu-Gi-Oh series. It has been critised for focusing too much on the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23904">
        protagonist, Judai, but I also think this is true of the other Yu-Gi-Oh series, especially 5D&#039;s. I recommend watching GX for people who are out to enjoy anime. If the viewer is overly critical, and watches GX for the sake of finding flaws, they will find plenty. But if you watch GX with the objective of being entertained, I don&#039;t think you will be disappointed. GX is a fast-paced series with an energetic protagonist and wonderful supporting cast, and if you like to look deeply into a series, you will find plenty of absolutely fascinating stuff lurking in GX. Watch this series with a wide open mind.

    It&#039;s best to note that while the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime is not the worst anime in existence, it is far from the best. This series puts a couple of blemishes on the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise; in fact, when compared with the manga, it earns the same reaction you&#039;ll find from avid Tsukihime fans: &amp;quot;What anime?&amp;quot;<br />
<br />
The premise of a dueling academy makes a lot of sense when you consider the fact that Yu-Gi-Oh! is about a children&#039;s card game. While the importance of a children&#039;s card game seems exaggerated in the viewers&#039; eyes, you have to remember that in this animeverse, it -isn&#039;t-. Duel Monsters is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10832">
        most popular--and clearly the most influential--sport of the world. Plus, when you realize the Academia still has the required graduation classes (though you won&#039;t see them too much on-screen), you realize that the school is a typical high school--just one with a very specialized &amp;quot;Ivy Leage&amp;quot; program.<br />
<br />
Still, while the premise doesn&#039;t have flaws, the way it was carried out does. The first half of season one made GX seem like a slice-of-life anime, which wouldn&#039;t be so much of a problem if the plot was at least consistent rather than having these separated one-shots. Then when GX actually started having substantial plots, it seemed like another series taking itself too seriously. A white hole in space sending proxies to bring about destruction? A deranged hermaphrodite demon seeking her lover? A force of darkness wishing to unify all existence in nothingness? Sorry NAS, not buying it. What probably made these plots worse was that they were arranged in a &amp;quot;What enemy will I face this school year?&amp;quot; fashion.<br />
<br />
The art was average. It didn&#039;t thrill me, but it didn&#039;t disgust me either. No more to say on that. Now as for music, that was actually GX&#039;s best asset. The OPs and EDs weren&#039;t the best, but the OST soundtracks were. They did their job of accenting the situations quite smoothly. If an upbeat song came on, the situation was happy or comical. If a slow and sad song came on, the situation was depressing or dark. And if that one song that raised your spirits came on, you knew the protagonist of the duel was making his comeback.<br />
<br />
NAS dropped the ball with its characters. Too many characters introduced at a time with too little development reserved for each one. Judai, the main character, was a Gary Stu that didn&#039;t get a background story until season three. The background wasn&#039;t even good either, turning out to be a contrived DM reincarnation rip-off with pathetically shallow &amp;quot;I need to grow up&amp;quot; development in season four that made him nothing more than an ass. And the other protagonists only got their little development in season one, and were shafted in season three with the appearance of the Academia champions.<br />
<br />
Still, I found myself enjoying the series while watching it. Much of the bashing GX gets is in hindsight, when the fans start looking back and realize the flaws they overlooked when they first watched it. In the end, the GX anime turned out to be run by a group of people who had no idea what direction they wanted to take the show in; they would rather insert any random and unnecessary bit of occult history and symbolism if it made viewers think they were actually putting any thought into the series. (And let me tell you, GX is riddled with occult stuff if you know how and where to find it.)<br />
<br />
I suggest that rather than watching this anime you read Kazuki Takahashi and Naoyuki Kageyama&#039;s manga adaptation.

    Yu☆Gi☆Oh!: Duel Monsters GX is oftenly known as the weakest Yu☆Gi☆Oh! series aside from Zexal, which in my honest opinion is under rating it a lot. The show may have it&#039;s flaws but it&#039;s actually an outstanding experience for anyone who looks for long running shows with great characters, funny interactions between them and entertaining story since it begins until it ends.<br />
<br />
The show features a lot of one shot episodes and characters thrown in the &quot;filler&quot; category, which is the first point in trashtalking the show. When the story begins it takes a bit long to get into the first arc so the first 30

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197233">
        or so episodes are the ones that introduce you to the show&#039;s premise and characters that stay for the longest, which I found alright since they take all of it&#039;s time to be properly introduced in a completely non-boring way. Aside from them, there are a bunch of one shot characters that stand in the bad side for silly yet entertaining reasons that never try to hard to be serious but still is pretty fun to watch. It&#039;s an original anime so the fillers will still be considered originals and skipping them will just take out from the experience the enjoyment they give. Even the one shot characters are likeable with many ways they have to express themselves, so no one feels the same as the last one as it goes on. They even come back in a later second season episode which actually give them the credit they deserve and it&#039;s a nice touch from the staff to not forget about them.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, during the show each one of the main bunch have their own proper development and mini arcs too, so they are not there just to support the main character (as it was in the original Duel Monsters series) but to acomplish their own goals and make a better experience out of it and in the end you&#039;ll just can&#039;t help but feel happy for how everything went for them (and miss them like I do...). <br />
<br />
The second main criticism the series get is regarding the first two main arcs of the story. While it&#039;s certainly true that the plot gets impactful and more interesting the last two arcs where &quot;shit hits the fan&quot;. The first half tries something completely different as it goes in a light-hearted (with serious moments) slice of life perspective (in a school where people learn to play card games to do something with their lives related to card games, as silly as it sounds it&#039;s pretty cool). It takes it&#039;s time to build up the world it presents and success because coming back to the point of the characters and their interactions it will always feel fresh and fun to watch.<br />
I consider a mistake to watch GX skipping the first half just because the second half is more serious, if it&#039;s done like that anyone who starts from season 3 onwards won&#039;t feel empathy for the characters, which are the show&#039;s strongest point in the experience of the story, so from the get go if you don&#039;t like them this animation is not for you and most importantly you will for sure miss a lot of crazy shit during seaons 1 and 2 that&#039;ll make you think the writers were in drugs during production.<br />
<br />
The actual plot though it&#039;s not perfect since at some point it foreshadows a lot of stuff that is never explained or brought back again later on, leaving a lot to think about without any answers, but looking for the silliest or serious outcomes will actually feel good.<br />
<br />
Production values-wise is the most solid of all the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, the designs for characters, monsters, environment and even duel disks are pretty interesting and the animation lacks mistakes in it (QUALITY). The soundtrack is also likeable since every background music fits perfectly the moment they play, the voice acting and dialogues in the japanese version is also excellent since every character feels natural with their voice actors representing them.<br />
<br />
Regarding the duels, well, it&#039;s Yu-Gi-Oh! so it&#039;s a standard so liking and understanding the card game is the first step to like or dislike GX.<br />
<br />
Opening and Ending songs are also good. In my opinion openings 3 and ending 4 are the best.<br />
<br />
Overall it really is an enjoyable experience and it&#039;s a shame that we will probably never see something GX related again (;_;)<br />
<br />
So if you like Yu-Gi-Oh! and card games animeys to begin with give GX a shot, it might feel like a hit or miss but if it hits you, you&#039;ll feel an eternal void inside of you the moment you see the last minutes of the show and try to move on by watching something else (the cycle of anime).

    Yugioh GX is a strange and confounding show. It has one of, if not the best casts in the Yugioh franchise, but it heavily underitilizes or derails most of them. It has perhaps the most likable, fleshed out, and developed protagonist in the franchise but at the cost of a lot of characters the show doesn’t know what to do with. It has some of the most conceptually interesting and narratively sound arcs in all of Yugioh, but one of them is rushed while the other has an ending that almost killed its season outright. GX has a lot of potential that finds itself capitalized

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377756">
        on brilliantly at times, but the show is just an inconsistent mess. <br />
<br />
That being said, this is easily the best Yugioh anime, at least in context of the original timeline. Unlike Duel Monsters, GX doesn’t treat you like a moron while padding itself out to oblivion with characters whose existences become increasingly confounding as the show’s nonexistent sense of logic somehow takes a nosedive for the sake of establishing threats for the main protagonist to beat over. Unlike 5D’s, it wasn’t the subject of a complete shift in focus following real-life scandals, causing the entire show to devolve into a jumbled mess of bastardized characters, intentional as well as accidental retcons, and nonsensical plot-points. In spite of all of this, GX has generally been seen as inferior to both. In fact, prior to Zexal’s miserable first season and all other Yugioh series that followed, GX was seen as the black sheep of the franchise. Even after Zexal II supposedly redeemed its series and the later entries found their reputations dwindling sometime after coming out, GX has always lived in the shadow of Duel Monsters and 5D’s. Why? Outside of the initially dismal reaction to the fun cheese dub which has gained a lot of fondness in the 2010s, it’s still puzzling as to why GX is looked at as the middling step-child in the original trilogy. While getting a definitive answer may be impossible, asserting the notion that GX is perhaps the best series in a lackluster franchise by virtue of being semi-decent is something at least someone might find worth doing as we examine some of the highs and lows of this strange, erratic entry.<br />
<br />
The first thing to dive into is the cast, which is both GX’s greatest strength and biggest weakness. Main character Judai, as well as other characters such as Manjoume and Chronos are incredibly likable and well-developed characters. That’s actually kind of the problem, though. They are pretty much the only characters that get used well on a remotely consistent basis outside of some of the ones introduced in season 3. In terms of the major characters introduced in the first half of the series, most of them find themselves largely relegated to the sidelines, or get absolutely derailed after the first season. <br />
<br />
A great example of the former is Asuka, who largely loses relevance in the series after her season 1 plot of trying to find her brother. She’s certainly a formidable duelist, and she even has a few instrumental wins in the first season, but by the second half of the show, she barely gets to duel anymore and only has a couple of single-episode arcs and showings. It’s telling that her only bearing on the main plots of seasons 3 and 4 amount to her essentially being assimilated around the halfway mark of those two respective seasons after dueling once...each. As for an example of the latter without touching on the broken mess of spoilers that is Kaiser, we have Daichi Misawa. Good lord in Heaven, what happened to one of the strongest characters and friendliest rivals of season 1? After being one of the few decent duelists in the first half of season one, they decided to play more into his “science” gimmick while making him a joke for the rest of the first and second seasons, culminating in his only significant on-screen duels amounting to losses and questionable forfeits as he randomly becomes insecure about being seen as weak. By season 3, he isn’t even dueling anymore, though the once friendly rival to Judai at least has his own interesting plot revolving one of the antagonists from season 1 who beat him.<br />
<br />
There are several other characters that suffer from these bad writing decisions. Judai’s sidekick of sorts, Shou, goes from a wimpy loser struggling to prove himself in the first season to a whiny coward who picks on freshmen just because season 2 decided to be the worst. The season 2 mainstays, Edo and Tyranno, have miserable introductory seasons, as the former has an annoying revenge plot, and the latter’s on again off again bickering with Shou over who gets to be Judai’s sidepiece is perhaps the most insufferable character dynamic in the franchise. However, a lot of these characters either barely matter in the latter half anyway, or become genuinely endearing once they find their own new personality traits, character dynamics, and big moments such as Tyranno nuking an entire wave of zombie students with a meteor attack just so his friends can reach season 3’s main antagonist.<br />
<br />
That’s the thing about GX. Whenever it knows how to develop a character well, it can produce some of the best characters in the franchise. Judai’s development is the best of any character in the series, as his fears over losing his friends to some of the more supernatural and dangerous aspects of dueling are weaponized in later seasons to great effect. He’s already a likable character at the start, with how his jovial, laid-back attitude eventually contrasts with his greatest fears. However, seeing how far the series goes to both break and reshape him while a bit flawed in some cases, is absolutely harrowing. They’re the main draw of seasons 3 and 4, as the darker tone of the series takes hold and legitimately sympathetic or at least interesting antagonists bring out the worst of Judai before he and his friends can overcome it. The show actually conveyed the messages of not giving into your greatest fears in life quite well, as those who do either give up on life, or become a more desperate, depressed, and inconsiderate version of themselves whose actions and failures haunt them at every turn.<br />
<br />
On a less cerebral note, there’s still Manjoume and Chronos. Out of the major side characters established since the beginning, they’re the only two who don’t get derailed or underutilized. Manjoume’s eventual development from the most abrasive elitist to a somehow more AND less egotistical powerhouse clown is honestly astonishing. While they perhaps could have done a bit more with him in later seasons, the dichotomy between his egotistical and borderline tsundere clown side growing simultaneously while sandpapering his more abrasive edges is a treat. He steals the show almost every time he’s on screen throughout his entire journey. As for Chronos, him learning to be less of an elitist professor who hates all of the students on the lower rung is equally compelling. Watching him slowly go from constantly trying to expel Judai to putting his line and career on the line for his students multiple times, makes for some of the most impactful scenes of each season. His final duel with Judai makes for the best, most compelling duel in the entire series as Chronos’ arc comes to a heartwarming close. There are other entertaining characters with their own arcs and gimmicks, such as Austin O’Brien’s militant and crafty nature leading to a compelling mini-arc and some of the third season’s funniest moments, and Jim Cook’s devotion to friendship being so powerful that he legitimately has a mystical item related to it and an alligator as his partner. However, we’ll be here all day if we go over every aspect of GX’s strangely inconsistent character writing.<br />
<br />
A cast of characters makes up the bulk of a series’ heart and soul, but the story that drives them along is similarly important...and often weak in this case The first half of the first arc is largely devoted to hilariously absurd, albeit inconsistent episodic plots, as well as a few minor character arcs. This is where a lot of the show’s charm is found, as the characters interact with the strange setting of their duel academy with hijinks ensuing. Chazz’s gloriously bizarre conquest in preparation for the mid-season finale is the best part of the first 26 episodes. The second half of that season is a rather weak “stop several bad guys from doing bad things for immortality and world domination” plot. The only interesting aspect of the arc is how Judai starts fearing the weight of the consequences that comes from losing whenever things get serious, and therefore has to learn to overcome that. There are contrivances and several odd filler episodes interpurced with the somewhat more serious arc, which makes the narrative of S1 even weaker. At least, the show goes through a beautiful transition period in the last few episodes of the season to send off some of its side characters.<br />
<br />
The second season/arc is even more drawn-out, as the first half largely has sequences of Judai bumbling through a forest, two of his classmates bickering back and forth on who gets to be his side-piece, and several filler duel episodes of inconsistent quality. The idea of someone slowly brainwashing the students is somewhat neat, as is the idea that Edo is looking for his father’s killer. It’s just that the former is dragged out for too long, and the latter isn’t really fleshed out or interesting here. The absurd nature of how Chazz launches a counter campaign later on and how Judai and his friends combat a deadly satellite are the only things of interest this time around beyond how some of the eclectic characters from the first season’s more bonkers slice-of-life half wreck shop here as Chronos, who tried to end Judai’s education in S1, gets multiple opportunities to stick his neck out for his students and occupation.<br />
<br />
The later seasons take on far darker storylines meant to utterly break Judai so that S4 can restore him into a more mature version of his old self. The execution of these ideas is a bit inconsistent, relying on breaking the rules of the game to defeat certain antagonists or just flat-out using lore to absolve the third season’s main antagonist of all of their atrocities because apparently it’s Judai’s fault anyway. However, some of the previously derailed or lackluster characters get significantly better portrayals with character-defining scenes, and the new cast members get their own fun arcs. Additionally, things such as Judai’s temporary downfall after throwing his friends’ lives in danger just to rescue a new person close to him, and some of the apparent character deaths are standout moments of the series. Season 4 would then expand upon these ideas with the darkness consuming all into collective consciousness plotline and how his depression and guilt over both what he put his friends through in S3 and everything that has ever transpired over the 3 years they’ve been at the duel academy. It does take a while to get there, as the show has to retroactively ruin one of the best deaths in the franchise. Despite that and how some rather important characters that would make perfect sense to feature more frequently are largely absent, this is still the best season for what it does with Judai and how thematically resonant and emotionally impactful it is. The middle episodes have some of the most resonant duels and storylines in the series with Manjoume and Chronos’s final moments of relevance.This is sadly where all relevance for most characters not named Judai come to an end, but at least some of them go out on a high note before getting sucked into the final plot of the show. The way it’s presented with the evil light from S2 being defeated and now S4 evil, uncaring darkness taking over so it can also be defeated is hokey, but there’s a lot that gets said here.<br />
<br />
The latter half of Season 4 becomes one of the best “human instrumentality” storylines for how it showcases what it’s like for the characters trapped in misery and the collective consciousness as they’re pressured into giving in, letting their lives go once and for all as they escape into the temporal abyss to end their cycle of failure and misery. It’s allegorical suicide, and only the most damaged person is left to fight it off as he weighs off his guilt and depression thanks to his friends’s attempts to reinvigorate his passion, as well as the responsibility he knows he has to those he cares about. This is the perfect capstone to Judai’s arc, and why in spite of the somewhat iffy and inconsistent execution that makes it hard to appreciate in the moment, the plotline is perhaps the richest of the series. It’s what allows the finale to truly feel earned and impactful.<br />
<br />
The final aspects to mention are the show’s audiovisuals. Much like Duel Monsters, the music in GX is great, albeit often overplayed in the first two seasons. Yutaka Minobe became the composer for the franchise from GX to Zexal. While this OST doesn’t have the grandiosity or sheer emotional weight of a lot of the Duel Monsters tracks done by Utena composer Shinkichi Mitsume, there are still plenty of energetic, chill, and beautiful tracks to choose from. Majoume’s theme is a somewhat mysterious yet somewhat lax piece, Fierce Attack goes harder than perhaps any track from the show, and Duelist is a personal favorite for how perfectly it encompasses the bittersweet nature of season 4. Other great tracks include Wicked Grudge, Sad Duel/Supreme King theme, Judai’s theme, and Beyond the Sorrow. Judai and Supreme King’s themes in particular are perhaps the most iconic pieces in the entire show as the former is a satisfying yet laid-back piece that’s sure to incite a mix of hype and a willingness to groove, while the latter is as fierce and downtrodden as Jaden grew to be in the third quarter of S3. The later seasons did get a ton of newer, often darker tracks more befitting of the grimmer tone, which is part of why the OST did not feel as repetitive in the show’s latter half. It’s a good thing, too, as several of these tracks are outstanding.<br />
<br />
The lineup of OPs and EDs is perhaps the most consistent in the franchise, with the only real dud being the first OP. Personal favorites include “Teardrop” by BOWL, “Precious Time, Glory Days” by Psychic Lover, and “Endless Dream” by Hiroshi Kitadani (OP 3, OP 4, ED 4). “Teardrop” is a beautifully somber song that speaks about opening up and letting out one’s sorrows from the perspective of someone they saved and therefore are devoted to, and seem to be directed at Jaden as he goes through primarily negative development in that season. “Precious Time, Glory Days” is a lot more hopeful and energetic, aware of the sorrows that took place but still being a fun and optimistic song in spite of everything just as Jaden grew to be by the end of S4. “Endless Dream” is a beautiful and somewhat bittersweet piece that opens up with a serene sequence as Jaden sleeps on a field of grass in broad daylight. It truly conveys the bittersweet nature of the final season as everyone moves on and gives it one last go with smiles on their faces.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the visuals are...about as mediocre as you’d expect from a Yugioh series. The franchise was never one to be sought after for sakuga or anything compared to most long-running shounen anime. This could mean that the series would focus more on detailed artwork and generally decent presentation. However, that’s not exactly the case, either. Studio Gallop returned to work on this show, and there are a few minor improvements as well as unique issues. Starting with the positives, there do seem to be more moments compared to Duel Monsters where important summons or attacks result in explosive sakuga cuts. The artwork is more consistently on-model than Duel Monsters, though oddities do still pop up here and there. While the characters are more consistently on model, there are still moments where they look particularly awkward from lower angles. The character and monster designs are often more pleasant as well, at least until the later seasons decided edgy BDSM-esque designs were the new “hip thing” for a lot of antagonist decks and boss monsters. The characters also get to have more visual interactions with the game, as field spells crumble around and affect them, and monsters get a bit more dynamic with their engagements. The early seasons in particular often look worse when characters aren’t dueling, as there are moments where character models very blatantly and awkwardly bounce around, snap, or hover from one part of the screen to the next as a substitute for animating any actual flight or walking. Any CG is thankfully limited to the occasional ugly game effect and a couple of episodes that use ugly water effects, compared to DM’s occasional grotesque CGI background. This would change forever once 5D’s rolled in, so it’s good to appreciate what’s here in Duel Monsters and GX before the franchise became CGI hell. Still, it’s hard not to say that the series fares a little better than Duel Monsters, which notoriously went through some rough patches in certain filler arcs. Both are largely still slideshows, though.<br />
<br />
It’s sad that the best of the original YGO trilogy is a depressingly inconsistent mess. There is a lot to like about GX, such as its cast of characters, the bizarre yet lax nature of the early episodes, and the stories the later seasons told. It has perhaps the most well-written and defined protagonist in the franchise, and tells a rather important message via one of the only decent post-Eva “collective consciousness/human instrumentality” plots. However, the show largely sidelines or derails most of its otherwise stellar cast, and a lot of ideas are fumbled in the most critical moments, like the insultingly awful conclusion to season 3. For everything fascinating or great about the show, something stupid counterbalances.<br />

Yugioh GX isn&#039;t not the easiest thing to recommend, but if you want a decent nostalgia trip, feel free to watch some of season 1 in dub form and switch to sub at your leisure until it becomes the only way to properly appreciate S3 or even watch S4. Your mileage will certainly vary with the first two seasons, but if you make it to the end, you might get a lot more out of it, emotionally and thematically, than you’d expect.

    Well, what&#039;s to say about Yu-Gi-Oh! GX? Well nothing much really. Basically they just added a new theme to Yu-Gi-Oh! that doesn&#039;t seem so good. When I first thought of the sequal of the Yu-Gi-Oh! series, I thought that this one had to be good, but yet I was wrong. On the other hand there are a few good things about this show. Many of the cards that Yu-Gi-Oh! players loved appear in the show more often and shows a different approach toward Duel Monsters. Usually we thought that the theme of the Cards were Egyptian Monsters and what not, but in GX they change

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147">
        it to modern day Monster themes. Many of the Characters have pretty well rounded themes, and it&#039;s nice to see what they&#039;ll draw next.<br />
<br />
Basically they began where the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters was near its ending. While Yuugi and friends were facing off the dangerous Yami Bakura in one last game, this Duel Academy was getting praise from around the world. Duel Academy not just teaches kids to become better duelists, but  also better Buisness men. Then appears Jaden Yuki, a kid that has one thing on his mind, becoming the next &quot;King Of Games&quot;. He&#039;s not the only one though. Once he joins Duel Academy he faces several opponents, some stronger then most. But does Jaden have what it takes to become &quot;King Of Games&quot;?<br />
<br />
Some advice to you about this series, don&#039;t watch the 4Kids TV version! If you know how bad 4Kids TV ruins many other good animes (ex: One Peice, Tokyo Mew Mew, etc), then you best know how bad it turns out. Try going on Youtube or some anime fourm where they show the anime in Japanese. You&#039;ll see that the characters are more serious then the ones 4Kids turned them into. Besides, we all know that Japanese anime is better then dubbed American versions, right? So take my advice and be more open minded about animes. Once again so it&#039;s refreshed in your heads.....4KIDS TV IS BAD!!! Thank you.

    I have a little confession: Yu-Gi-Oh: Duel Monsters GX wasn&#039;t that bad, BUT wasn&#039;t that good. <br />
Okay, let&#039;s begin:<br />
<br />
10 years have passed after we broke up from our beloved Yugi, Atem and their friends, here comes a new story about Judai, a dueling dreamer, who is going to a duel academy to learn how to be the best dueler all over the world. Without to notice, Judai meets Yugi on his way to school, when Yugi gives him a luck card: The Winged Kuriboh (Judai calls him at the beginning &#039;Partner&#039; and after that, the real name). Since then, Judai comes to school and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13111">
        adventures begin.<br />
Until here everything is good and pretty. But the 2 first seasons were unnecessary to me. Why? Because they were such as fillers and boring. The improvement is seen in the 3rd season, when there are good episodes and good new characters (Johan of course ^__^). One more surprising thing is the 4th season, that actually is the main portion, during the previous seasons are the appetizers. <br />
But what&#039;s the matter? Also on the original Yu-Gi-Oh there was an improvement, But it was since 2nd season. There is a different.<br />
<br />
Art was very great and very good, such as any anime I love. Quality? Excellent (Although the dub version has a bad quality LOL)<br />
<br />
Sound? Very good. I am also buzzing the soundtrack any single moment(The dub version sounds like a drag-show). The japanese voices very great and the songs also. <br />
<br />
Characters? Very great. Judai is so cute, and when he grew up, he was very valued (That&#039;s why am I calling him:&#039;Pet-Yugi&#039; XD). Sho sounds twetty, but he was cute. Manjoume? My favourite. Asuka? Very good character. Chronos? was annoying a little. But still, There were many good characters to me. Any character that was a villain at the beginning, has changed to good (Remember Kaiba, Pegasus and Malik?), but in any anime is like that, no?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment? I told when I reviewed on the story, but I can tell that I stayed because of many great characters, such as Manjoume, Edo, Fubuki and Ryo (My faves+Johan and Jim from 3rd season and up) and that&#039;s why I love the 3rd and the 4th seasons of the anime.<br />
<br />
And overall? If you look for bishies (And shipping xD) and you are a fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh series, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters is the perfect anime for you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    The tightrope between absurdity and existentialism. The setting is not what it appears to be.<br />
<br />
The series has remained fascinating to me for many years, despite its status as a tie-in to a trading card game. The expectations going in are low, but the show dazzled me as a younger man for its surprising depth of character writing and the journey of the characters. GX is absurd, but also unafraid to go to dark places. It&#039;s about growing up, the meaning of games, the pain of adolescence, and the Jungian shadow.<br />
<br />
Judai is at first an annoying main character. Blithe, casually arrogant, undisciplined. But there is also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291662">
        an innocence to him that is in equal measure endearing and disturbing. There is something &quot;off&quot; about him, and as we learn more of his past in the later seasons, it all starts to make sense. His character is a microcosm for the series as a whole - boyish playfulness and youthful exuberance masking inner darkness, shadows bubbling madly beneath the surface. Minute by minute, the youthful ideals are stripped away and the child is thrust into adulthood.<br />
<br />
The side characters suffer from the problem most shonen side characters do - lack of plot important battles and victories. But what they lack in those they make up for with strong character arcs. Manjoume is a great twist on the usual &quot;shonen rival&quot; archetype, Shou is a similarly unique take on the &quot;insecure shy best friend&quot; cliche, Ryo and the &quot;aloof big brother&quot;. All of them deconstruct the usual templates. The character writing is pound for pound superior to Yugioh Duel Monsters, and that is a FACT.<br />
<br />
The technical aspects of the show are fine. The animation is generally good, with peaks and valleys seen in all long running series. Japanese soundtrack is decent, Sad Duel is a great track. The openings and endings are very good, except for the first OP and ED, which are booty in my opinion. 99% is both melancholy and hopeful, Precious Time Glory Days is a rousing anthem.<br />
<br />
The dub is hilarious, and cheesy enough to capture the more absurd elements of the show. It surpasses cringe and leaps headlong into meme territory. It fails utterly at the serious moments though, and the sub is overall the superior product by leaps and bounds.<br />
<br />
This series stands apart from Yugioh Duel Monsters, there is a serious argument to be made for it being better. Those who call it a knockoff are ignorant and fail (or refuse to) see the series&#039; merits. The depth is there - choose to see it! I will defend this series any day any time.

    Please note before you read this, the scores i gave it were all 10&#039;s. I&#039;ll explain in detail shortly<br />
<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh!, as we all know it , is a super successful card game show, and downright franchise. Most of the content that spill&#039;s out of its universe, is made purely, for cash. The original series people will argue, is the same. And they are right, but here&#039;s how I look at it. So fucking what? As a child, me and the kids my age were absorbed into this show and its card game. I was about maybe around 9 when GX came out, and as a kid

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38326">
        I could not see the huge flaws that make up this show. We loved it so much, all these franchises, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon. Hell, maybe even some Digimon. These things, make up what I liked to do as a kid with friends and alone. And at the age of 16, I am secure enough to say I fucking love this show. Not that i would watch it or play the card game, Hell no I&#039;m no fucking loser, but i love the memories and I still have a tremendous respect for this show.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&#039;s all horrible, or it&#039;s all good. Does not matter. The story is shit. We have no development and all their is for characters are Archtypes. But that&#039;s OK. The dissection is redundant at this point! It was more about the cards then the actual show. But still this show had our tiny brains absorbed into this spikey haired, over the top, repetitive show! But at least it was consistent! If i had to pick most show&#039;s that game out now, or this, THIS in a fucking heartbeat. No not Angel Beats, Shoo weeaboo. <br />
<br />
<br />
We basically got our dumb protagonist Jayden, who only losses when it suits the plot accordingly, our evil pedophile DR who wants to take him down, A stuck up rival who has a Ojama complex, a chick who does not want to show us her titties, a pussy for a best friend, Fat albert if he was a white Koala, and a strain of side characters that have more meaning than some. <br />
<br />
<br />
This show sounds like shit! But when we were kid&#039;s we could let that all go and take it simply for what it was. Any review criticizing this show for its countless flaws is redundant. The only thing that matters to rate this show, No, this universe, is how it affected YOU. Fuck character and art and sound (Get your game on) YOU are what this show is about. Now take all your cards from you closet, or if you sold them remember the times, and just take a gander at yourself. This to people who grew up with any franchise, That IS YOU. Take it or leave it.

    Perhaps the only case of anime where the dub actually did a better job than the original, and we&#039;re talking 4kids here.<br />
<br />
Set approximately 10 years after the original ended, we meet Jaden, a student who enrolls in the famous Duel Academy, that trains people to becomes pros. Since it&#039;s a yugioh anime that&#039;s not Arc V (or 5ds) you can already guess that there isn&#039;t much in terms of character development, backstory etc etc. Jaden is nothing short of a hyperactive cheerful clown who has the occasional kinda-badass moments, and then we have the background cast of Alexis, Bastian, Chazz, Cyrus and a few others,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189784">
        though you will only remember Chazz since he&#039;s in almost as many episodes as Jaden (they&#039;re rivals... kindof... Usually it&#039;s Chazz making a fool of himself and then dueling Jaden for insertstreetfighterlogichere). The villains will settle for nothing less than world domination (minus the 3rd arc villain who... Lets not spoil it, she is pretty unique though), and will stop at nothing to destroy their opponents... That is to say minus the rules of a duel that more ofter than not they have no reason to play. But this is yugioh, all conflict is solved with card games. <br />
<br />
Now for the duels themselves, definitely an improvement from the original. Pretty much everyone uses fusions, or otherwise will end up using fusions. The only exceptions are the occasional one-episode villain using a lockdown burn deck, and the final bosses of each arc. The duels are from start to finish intents, starting the long tradition of the yugioh anime (&amp;game) of changing who has the upper hand per turn. Obviously this manages to keeps the tensions up and give you quite a spectacle. And this is where the highlight of the dub comes in, for once 4Kids puns&amp;insults are not AS horrible as you would expect. Surely there are a lot of retarded lines along the way, but certain catchprases like &quot;Game On&quot; will definitely make an impression to you. Another thing that 4kids did right was replace the (mediocre at best) original soundtrack with various techno themes that REALLY get you going (seriously, kudos for that). The voice acting isn&#039;t half bad either, with various characters other than Jaden managing to make an impression, especially when it comes to villains. Satorius (the second season&#039;s villain) especially had some amazing voice acting done for his part, which is also the reason the second season (Light of Destruction) is bound to be your favourite of the four.<br />
<br />
Honestly there is not much to say about GX, I suggest watching the dub as far as it goes, for the awesome music (and kinda barable puns) if not for nothing else, and then continuing to the final season with the original, since 4kids decided not to dub it due to overly diabolical themes (despite the series actually going well in terms of viewers). Game on!

           This is my first time righting a review for an anime, but I will explain this as thoroughly as possible. I watched this in Sub because 4 Kids did a terrible job.<br />
<br />
        Yu-Gi-Oh! GX follows a time period after that of the original Yugioh and we follow Yuki Judai, who is on his way to an elite school for duelists &quot;Duel Academia&quot; , as he progresses his success often grabs the attention others negatively, much like the original series with Yugi and Kaiba. If you watch the beginning your going to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150891">
        feel like this show is one of those normal high-school settings just with the addition of dueling, however as you progress things become much more intense. The first two seasons in a way are created for Judai to develop himself and for that reason they are the worst seasons of the series. <br />
<br />
      Once you get to season 3 that&#039;s when the true enjoyment starts to kick in. This is the period of time where Judai has to use everything he learned from his time to solve situations that are extremely difficult for him. Not only does the intensity grow but he starts to make decisions that can cause grief and sadness to those around him. If you are looking at this series and thinking should I watch it or not, here is my recommendation to you, if you want to go through the complete character development and all the experiences he has watch it from the beginning.<br />
<br />
      If you want to get right into the juicy part of this start watching at the start of the 3rd season which I believe starts at episode 105. The reason I believe this is fine is because major characters of the story come into play right into this episode and the plot starts to pick up from the slow pacing that was occuring before that.<br />
<br />
       The soundtracks for GX were good but nothing too special, the best opening imo being the third one. However the sound matches in the setting always in a good way to give the viewer the idea of what is about to occur.<br />
<br />
      Overall, GX was the deepest and most enjoying of the Yugioh series, the reason being the hardships that Judai had to go through, and how he overcame his situation. Also his emotions and the way he reacted when things did not go his way becomes a very enjoyable thing to watch. I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of duel monsters and rate it the highest out of any of the series over the original as well.<br />

    After the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime was finished, Konami commissioned a sequel to be made. Already this would prove a bit difficult for the guys at Studio Gallop as the Manga had ended, so they would literally have to pull stuff right out of their asses for this show.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it paid off magnificently, as to this day I consider Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX (GX standing for Generation NeXt) to be the best anime in this franchise, if not straight up the best thing to come out of it. Why is that? Well, let’s find out:<br />
<br />
1st Arc: Seven Stars Arc (Episodes 1-52):<br />
<br />
One thing I loved about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295882">
        this show is that it deliberately starts off slow. No hints of an ongoing narrative are shown until a few episodes in, which really helps to set the tone for the rest of the show: The characters come first, the story is simply a vehicle to develop these characters.<br />
<br />
That said; these early episodes are a bit hit or miss. Nothing truly terrible, mind you, but sometimes it feels as if they were seeking for excuses to promote new Cards. That said, the actual main plot itself is perfectly fine, even if it just… kinda ends without much fanfare now that I think about it.<br />
<br />
That said, the actual end of the Arc (The Graduation Duel between Judai and Kaiser) was fantastic, and a hell of a way to end it all.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, we have a lot to unpack so let’s get through them.<br />
<br />
Firstly is the main character, Yuki Judai, and I just adore this guy. He’s adorkable, confident yet also isn’t a complete idiot. His studies may suck, but that’s because he’s just lazy, if he actually wasn’t he’d be a brilliant student. I’ll talk more about him later as his growth is pretty much the main focus of the show.<br />
<br />
His supporting cast is also pretty good. Tenjoin Asuka serves as an effective female lead, even if she loses a few too many times. Marafuji Sho is definitely a different kind of best friend character from Jonouchi, but in a good way. He’s meek and insecure, which leads him to cling onto Judai, and while his growth in confidence does end up eventually causing a rift between the two, it’s never quite enough to completely shatter their bond. Manjoume Jun is an arrogant dumbass to be sure, but damn if I don’t love him for what he is. Much of the same can be said about Tenjoin Fubuki, just replace the arrogant thing with a penchant for theatrics. Finally there’s Cronos de Medici, a character that by all means should be a one and done, yet had some of the best development in the whole show.<br />
<br />
Now, GX had a couple of rivals, however the one I consider to be the main one is Marafuji “Kaiser” Ryo. He’s probably one of the more dynamic characters in this show. For now, all I’ll say is that I do like his initial personality. Somewhat arrogant, yet not as much as previous and later rivals and has a general air of nobility around him.<br />
<br />
As for the villains in this arc, I honestly didn’t care much for them. None of them were awful or anything, but none left that big an impression on me. The only one to note is Darkness, who’ll become important later.<br />
<br />
The rest are D-List characters so no use in talking about them.<br />
<br />
2nd Arc: Society of Light Arc (Episodes 53-104):<br />
<br />
This arc is really more of the same when you get down to it. I don’t hate it (In fact, I quite like this arc) but it just goes on for way longer than it needed to.<br />
<br />
In my review of the original Duel Monsters series, I mentioned how the Doma arc served as a bit of a blueprint for this arc. I less so meant that in terms of plot progression but moreso in terms of themes. Characters being turned to the dark side because of manipulations by the big bad? That sounds kinda familiar, doesn’t it?<br />
<br />
Judai’s development begins this season. He suffers a very nasty win at the beginning that completely crushes him both physically and mentally. Most of his arc here revolves around moving on from said trauma (Which is done in the first half of the arc) and eventually admitting that he was so caught up in his own problems that he didn’t even realize that his friends were also in trouble.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Kaiser suffers some radical changes this season. Similarly to Judai, his arc begins as a result of a loss; however it has moreso to do with the fact that he’s been a perfect Duelist for so long that he doesn’t know how to deal with loss. This all eventually devolves into him slowly losing his mind before becoming an Ax-Crazy psychopath. Think Mai’s arc during the Doma arc, just on a larger scale.<br />
<br />
As far as the characters that are introduced here, only a few matter. The first is Edo Phoenix, Judai’s sorta rival for this season. He’s definitely the one who’s the most different yet similar to Judai, to the point both run similar Decks (By the way, try mixing those two up in real life. It makes for a rather effective combination). His own arc is mostly set around his past and how it has haunted him even after so many years. I do like the guy, though I wish he had slightly more screen time after this arc.<br />
<br />
There’s also Tyrano Kenzan, a character the show tries to treat as important, but he really isn’t in the grand scheme of things. I don’t hate him or anything; however he’s just not that interesting a character to me.<br />
<br />
Finally there’s the villains, and boy are these an upgrade over the ones in the last Season. Firstly there’s DD (I really hope that’s just a stage name), who’s just a bastard in every sense of the word and I was happy when Edo killed him. Then there’s the Saiou siblings, Mizuchi and Takuma. Mizuchi is nothing special, basically just a retread of Ishizu from DM. But boy is Saiou Takuma a great villain. He’s basically Dartz on steroids, as in, everything about him is exaggerated. I love him, and I’m at least 90% sure that he’s at least part of the reason Koyasu Takehito got the role of DIO in Jojo, given that he got to say ZA WARUDO way before that show came out.<br />
<br />
Overall, a pretty good, arc, though not perfect.<br />
<br />
3rd Arc: Dimension World Arc (Episodes 105-156):<br />
<br />
Hands down, the best and darkest arc in the whole show. One of the things GX is infamous of is that even though the first 100 or so episodes were rather lighthearted, the last 80 or so are some of the darkest in the franchise. From this point on, the show effectively decides to deconstruct its premise, with it being reconstructed in the final arc. I’m a sucker for reconstructions, so you cans see why I would love this show so much.<br />
<br />
The pacing is once again rather slow, but this time I actually think it works to the show’s benefit. This arc has a lot going on at once, and the slow pacing allows for everything the arc wants to focus on to get some spotlight. At the same time, it allows it to create a dark and uncomfortable atmosphere, which fits the new setting.<br />
<br />
Judai’s development really kicks in this arc. At first, he tries to keep his happy-go-lucky attitude he had for the rest of the show, but his selfishness and the stress all finally catch up to him, leaving him as the perfect puppet for the show’s antagonists. By the end of this arc, he’s but a shell of his former self.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Kaiser gets some massive development. He’s softened out since the last arc, and while this can come kinda out of nowhere, given that we learn later on that he’s dying, it could be interpreted as him just trying to get some closure. I kinda wish that he had actually died instead of just being relegated to a wheelchair, but oh well.<br />
<br />
As far as characters introduced, there are three that are parts of the good guys. The first is Johan Andersen, and if you’ve been around this community for long enough, people can’t make up their minds about him. I think he’s okay as he does have a very believable friendship with Judai, but I will admit he’s my least favorite of the three new characters. Jim Crocodile Cook is one of those; he’s so delightfully charming and quircky that you can’t help but love him, yet he’s also competent and knows when to get serious. However it was Austin O’Brien who stole the show for me. He’s a badass, has a very interesting backstory, and an honest to god character arc. Needless to say, I was more than happy that he came back the following arc.<br />
<br />
However the best thing about this arc is its villains. The first of any major importance, Satou Kouji, does have some rather backwards-ass logic, but he does have a massive impact on Judai, to the point that despite appearing in only two episodes, Judai answers a question he asked him almost 40 episodes after that. Then there’s Professor Cobra, who’s effectively Leo Akaba from Arc-V, except he doesn’t suck. This man is wrapped in his own delusions, ones that don’t even allow him to see the reality in front of him, which all ultimately leaves to his own admittedly tragic death.<br />
<br />
However it’s the other two that stand out. Amon Garam is definitely one of the most unique antagonists in the franchise. He has a God Complex, sure, but it’s not as if he can’t feel empathy, and ultimately the sacrifices he had to make to achieve his status do haunt him, which definitely makes him an interesting character to talk about. But let’s face it, the one that really matters is Yubel. This… whatever the hell Yubel is, is messed up beyond belief, but given all of the crap that happened in Yubel’s past and how Yubel’s own love for Judai ended up causing Yubel’s own fall into insanity, it’s no wonder that it was Yubel of all people that was the one villain to survive this arc (Oh, and the reason I have only used Yubel’s name instead of using pronouns is because I have no idea what Yubel’s gender is meant to be given that Yubel is a hermaphrodite).<br />
<br />
Overall, the best arc in the show bar none, if not one of the best in the whole franchise.<br />
<br />
Final Arc: Darkness Arc (Episodes 157-180):<br />
<br />
This is where the show’s reconstruction begins. Since most of the initial supporting cast was sidelined last season, the majority of this arc is focused on tying up their character arcs. It’s all very well done, and thankfully everyone gets at least two episodes to tie everything up.<br />
<br />
The main plot is, ironically, a bit of a subplot when you stop and think about it. The arc is the shortest in the whole show, sure, but it’s kinda funny when you stop and realize that most of the main plot just happens in the background. Thankfully it’s well done, so I don’t have much to complain about when it comes to this.<br />
<br />
What does deserve mention, however, is Judai. The guy is almost unrecognizable from the last two arcs, to the point he got a massive redesign just for these last few episodes. Most of his cheeriness is gone, often replaced with him sulking or just being rather cold to everyone around him. He’s still a nice guy, but you can tell that most of the times, the smiles he does show are no longer even genuine. However by the end, it’s clear that this was all a result of stress having caught up to him, and he just can’t enjoy what he loves doing anymore. In fact, the fact that the final duel had no stakes whatsoever was what allowed him to regain most of his cheeriness, though he does know he has more responsibilities from now on.<br />
<br />
As for the final villain, Darkness, he’s perfectly fine. He’s basically Don Thousand from ZeXal, except he doesn’t completely suck. He’s a bit generic, sure, but he’s a competent enough antagonist and his goal, while extreme, does have a bit of a point to it.<br />
<br />
Overall, a really good final arc and a fitting end to the show.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
It’s… middle of the road. To be fair, it does mostly stay on model, but it never reaches any moment that looks particularly amazing. The show just kinda settles into being just… average looking.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
By contrast the soundtrack is fantastic. Once again, classical instruments are often used; however I noticed a larger use of the electric guitar this time around, which I really liked. As for the Openings, while I didn’t care much for “Kaisei Jōshō Harerūya”, but it’s not awful either. I also didn’t care much for “99%”, but again, it isn’t awful. That said, I loved the third opening “Teardrop” and I have yet to meet a single person who doesn’t love “Precious Time, Glory Days”, myself included. I also quite liked the Endings, with the exception of the third one “Taiyou”. My absolute favorite, though, was the second one “WAKE UP YOUR HEART”.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Funnily enough, this is probably the only show in the franchise that averted having an amateur cast. Yeah, more than a few of the voice actors don’t have much experience, however there’s also a large amount of big names here, and most of the main antagonists have big name voice actors. As far as said big names go, we have talents like Yamaguchi Kappei, Kobayashi Sanae, Inoue Kazuhiko, Gouda Hozumi and even the late great Tsuru Hiromi as Yubel, pulling out her best performance in her whole career.<br />
<br />
However there are two Seiyuus in particular that stand out. The first is Maeda Takeshi as Kaiser, who had a superb performance as him and I’m confused as to why he hasn’t had more roles yet. However the absolute best performance in this show (And indeed, this was his big break and debut) was KENN as Judai himself. He captured all parts of Judai’s character, and I’m happy he still comes back to this role from time to time.<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
<br />
So yeah, I loved this show. Is it perfect? Hell no! However I did really enjoy it, and the hatred it’s gotten never seizes to confuse me. It’s a wild ride to say the least.<br />
<br />
Also, the dub for GX is the worst thing ever and you should avoid it.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    I don&#039;t get why everyone says Yugioh GX sucks so much, I prefer it more than the other three. Probably because of the dub. But this series was amazing and heart-felt and I don&#039;t regret watching it.<br />

Okay, first off the story. The first season is what drew me to the series because of the light-hearted themes in it. At one point, things kinda got serious but nonetheless it still had its comic relief. The story was kind of scattered though. It wasn&#039;t until around later did it finally get into it&#039;s actual plot, not that I had a problem with. The second season was the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42855">
        same thing but with a different plot. The third season started off light hearted but then later on we see a much more meaningful plot that leads on into season four. I  loved that. Not even the duels turned me off. In fact, it had me on the edge of my seat. And I&#039;m a girl. :P<br />
<br />
The art was really nice. But at some points they didn&#039;t color it right. Like for example, they had once colored Judai/Jaden&#039;s eyes grey and they forgot to shade in the orange-brownish patch at the top of his head. Anyways, the art was really well done and not lazy at all.<br />
<br />
The Soundtrack was really good but I prefer the yugioh. The music really matched the scene that was playing and it really added to the mood. Also I fell in love with the season two ending - Wake Up Your Heart by KENN (Judai&#039;s voice actor) and the season three opening - Teardrop by BOWL.<br />
<br />
Another thing I really like about this series is the characters, especially Judai. The other protagonists for the other yugioh series (not sure about Yuma) have a sort of win-or-die attitude and have been slapped or punched for being so...ahem...&quot;EMOtional&quot;(once again not sure about Yuma). But not Judai. Well, before season four but still. Judai would probably get slapped for being so naïve or stupid. He had a happy-go-lucky air around him that draws people to him like moths to a light. Even when he lost, he still had his happy air. However, at the start of season four, Judai had undergone a major character change, which in other words he matured with a twist. And I also love his &quot;twin&quot; Johan/Jesse. I wished he came in around season one so he could get more screen time and character development.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed watching this series and re-watching my favorite moments over and over. I recommend this show to those who like Yugioh and school-based animes. Even if you dont, still just watch it, you wont regret it. Forget what everyone else is saying about how this show sucks.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this show a 10. As I said before, you will not regret watching this show and the duels are just as amazing. But if you want the full enjoyment of this show, watch the japanese version like I did.

    I honestly don&#039;t care what people say to this even if you watched the Eng dub and full of censorship, this anime will still be my childhood. (Eng dub = bad)<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve come to realize that in the later seasons the show has more to offer rather than just dueling, and it grounded itself by inserting consequence and growth toward the main character which he struggled at first which caused psychological trauma and an unforeseen shift to narrative which I think separates itself from the first yugioh <br />
<br />
The First half of the 1st season was a slice of life kind of yugioh but the 2nd half

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362045">
        got to the main story<br />
<br />
The 2nd season are mixed with filler episodes and the main story episodes <br />
<br />
The 3rd season didn&#039;t fool around and gave filler episodes and went straight to the mature side of the story which is why this is the best season and it focused on Judei Yuki character development <br />
<br />
The 4th season gave the side characters some development and it finishes with Yugi vs Judei  <br />
<br />
Also that droplet of romance in that one episode gets me all the time

    First of all, I came here, not to talk about the story, but to get rid of this burden after watch this series<br />
<br />
I have a lots of comments about this one<br />
<br />
I am a Yu-gi-oh fan, and I am the type of person who likes to see all series<br />
<br />
I got really disapointed, unfortunately I saw this GX series in 3 languages, the first season I&#039;ve downloaded in the original language (JAP) and I started to like it, but around 50th or 60th episodes, I couldn&#039;t find in Japanese, and downloaded Portuguese Version, which kinda sucks<br />
<br />
Around 80th&#039;s I had the bad luck to encounter the disgusting version

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40493">
        of Cartoon Network and 4Kids, which made me hate GX series<br />
<br />
It&#039;s all wrong in English series, the duel card format, the soundtrack, the voices and their accents, the fuckin&#039; american lame jokes that completely ruined the Anime scene<br />
<br />
Well, I would love to see this one all in Japanese, but I couldn&#039;t find, so... life sucks, and that&#039;s why I scored as a 4<br />
<br />
After this experience, I am completely against DUBBED versions<br />
<br />
And one more thing, sorry the bad english

    This isn&#039;t a perfect series, it has it&#039;s ups and downs, the first season suffers a lot from introducing a lot of characters and no real over all plot, though that improves in the second and third season.<br />
<br />
What the show does have that I love is some really nice themes, and doesn&#039;t seem to suffer from 1 card syndrome like other yugioh&#039;s I&#039;ve watched, where the main char only ever uses the same card every fight to win.  His deck is varied with enough surprises and new editions, along with everyone else.<br />
<br />
What I do like is how every characters deck has it&#039;s own theme

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250072">
        and feel to it that progresses for the most part as the series goes on.  We see a evolution in most of the characters deck&#039;s and themselves.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this one over all, recently having watched the third season I had skipped before, and found it enjoyable, despite being darker then previous stuff.<br />
<br />
I would suggest checking it out if you love the card game, or just like the anime in general, I originally was concerned about the theme of a school wasn&#039;t sure if there would be enough there, but while the first season like I said had some of that issue, it got better over all, and still enjoyed the first season.

    Following up the original yugioh series, we have yugioh GX. Now if you are looking for something to top the original, this is sadly not it. While pretty fun to watch the story lacks a lot from the original yugioh which has a pretty deep story, GX offers a more childish and fun story to watch.<br />
<br />
Story 5/10: Jaden goes to a dueling school and just goes threw seperate arcs. It is a simple story and not very in depth. Fun to watch, nothing more. <br />
<br />
Art 7/10: The art in yugioh GX is average, the monsters look alright but some are made childish, too childish and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127677">
        annoying.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10: Music is very catchy, game on get your game on! <br />
<br />
Character 7/10: Most of the characters develop throughout the anime and there are some hilarious characters in the pack, although also some annoying ones. Kid show, variety isn&#039;t massive. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10: It&#039;s a very fun series to watch but nothing that will change your life.<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10: Watch it for fun if you&#039;re bored but don&#039;t expect much. I recommend watching original yugioh instead its better or the abridged series, even better than that.

    This is going to be a rather harsh review so skip it if you do like the series. Also it contains spoilers for some bits so read at your own risk.<br />
<br />
I honestly do not understand how anybody is giving this series above a 5. It is one of the most painfully mediocre anime series I&#039;ve come across in all my years of watching anime. The second half of 5D&#039;s which is a trainwreck compared to the first half is HIGH ART compared to GX. I&#039;ll admit I&#039;ve only watched random bits of the series, but I&#039;ve watched large chunks across the first three seasons, so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209410">
        I think I&#039;ve seen enough to be able to judge it. However, if you do like this series, I commend you and am glad you can find some redeeming value in this series.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
These characters... Calling them &quot;characters&quot; is too kind. Even calling them cardboard cutouts would be too generous. These are some of the most static, cliche, bland, forgettable characters I&#039;ve come across in all my years of viewing anime. There is almost no character development to speak of. Even when they DO get development, they tend to act like their development never happened. <br />
The best example of this is Chronos. He starts out as an antagonist then drifts to being a bit of an ally to Judai and co toward the end of the first season. He even ends up being proud of Hayato and recommends him to Industrial Illusions. But by time the second season starts, he&#039;s actively trying to destroy the Osiris Red Dorm. <br />
The characters are also inconsistent.<br />
Manjoume is extremely driven, hard-headed, and independent, but during the last bit of the first season, he falls in love with Asuka quite literally out of nowhere. I mean I skipped the first half of the first season, so maybe there was some interest shown before. However, there was absolutely NO indication of that during the previous episodes of the Seven Star Assassin&#039;s arc.<br />
The worst part is that the characters are static beyond belief. I watched half of the first season, part of the second, and half of the third, but I saw absolutely no character growth in anybody. Judai was still the same, boring shounen protag he always was. Manjoume was the same joke he always was. Shou remained the same coward he always was. Misawa wasn&#039;t even there for half of the third season. <br />
There is no character to growth to speak of. I&#039;m a writer so I know what real character growth look like.<br />
Mostly static characters are not bad in and of themselves. In fact, they can be very interesting. However, when the entire cast is static, that&#039;s when there&#039;s a problem. None of the characters grow at ALL. <br />
<br />
Art/Sound: 5/10<br />
The animation and sound on this series are...mediocre at best. There&#039;s nothing that really makes it stand out from other serialized anime. <br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
Admittedly, I am not the most qualified person to judge the story since I&#039;ve seen maybe 20-40% of the series, so I&#039;m going to more use this category to judge the quality of the writing from what I saw.<br />
As you can tell, I thought it was absolutely dreadful. this is one of the most filler-ridden, soulless pieces of garbage I&#039;ve ever seen. To put into perspective just how trashy this anime is, I started watching at episode 27 and I had NO trouble keeping up with what had happened. I was admittedly a little bit more confused when I jumped over basically all of season two into season three, but I felt like I had lost nothing when I skipped so much. The stories were mostly self-contained enough to not really need too much backstory on what had happened in previous seasons. Even for when season two bled over into three, I jumped in without much of any trouble. I know this was one way to attract viewers as the anime progressed while it was airing, but it&#039;s still pretty bad.<br />
The worst part of this series if the FILLER. I know it&#039;s to be expected of any long-running show especially in shounen, but that doesn&#039;t excuse just how tedious and BORING it is. I admittedly skipped over the majority of season two, but the first ten episodes at least have next to NOTHING related to the plot. The main plot during those episodes focuses around trying to get rid of the Osiris Red dorm. The main plot for the first bit of the seconds season is literally just trying to get rid of one of the dorms. <br />
However, the worst part of the lazy writing is the deus ex machina. It happens three times in the last bit of season 1 and the first bit of season 2. The first one is when they need to get the spirit gates open so they have Manjoume randomly fall in love with Asuka and take the keys. When he loses to her, the gates open and Judai faces Kagemaru. What&#039;s supposed to be the first season&#039;s climax is a rushed clusterfuck. It takes only about two episodes to resolve which would be fine if it were any good. But no. I don&#039;t care if they established the Philosopher&#039;s Stone card a few episodes before, but they didn&#039;t establish its effects. It grants Judai three wishes for cards he needs and that&#039;s how he wins. It&#039;s anticlimactic at best and offensively lazy writing at worst. I know they were probably strapped for time, but if you&#039;re going to have this duel be the climax, THEN GIVE IT THE PROPER TIME IT NEEDS. DON&#039;T JUST HAVE IT END BECAUSE JUDAI CAN GET WHATEVER HE NEEDS TO BEAT THE BAD GUY. The other example comes in season two when Judai gets his new deck. He&#039;s literally just whisked away to a planet to resolve an emotional crisis and is handed the cards he needs to defeat Ed.<br />
The writing seems to get somewhat better in season three since you get the plot moving forward unimpeded without filler for awhile...but then it just stops for a small filler arc with zombie students.<br />
This is where I gave up on the series and couldn&#039;t continue due to the painful mediocrity. The story is admittedly interesting, but there&#039;s an old adage in writing that holds true here: &quot;Strong characters can carry a weak plot but a strong plot cannot carry weak characters.&quot; That is so painfully true in the third season of GX. The plot is interesting but the characters are so one dimensional you just cannot care about them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
If negative scores were a thing on this website, my enjoyment would be in the negatives. This series bored me at best and insulted my intelligence at worst. <br />
I&#039;ll go into my personal reasons for watching the series at this point.<br />
I don&#039;t remember exactly how or why I started watching 5D&#039;s last year, but I did and I absolutely fell in love with it. I&#039;m a test-based roleplayer, so it was inevitable that my main partner and I started messing around in the 5D&#039;s universe. My main character is Aki and my muse of her has grown and drifted from canon in some ways. Mine can actively see and interact with the duel spirits in her deck, so I picked up GX since it&#039;s the series that delves into them the most. <br />
Needless to say, I gave up before I got through the entirety of the third season. <br />
Is it unfair to compare GX to 5D&#039;s? I don&#039;t think so, but it&#039;s basically apples and oranges. 5D&#039;s is a great series with strong character development and interactions (for the most part) with a compelling plot and characters. GX is a mediocre, stale, cliche, cookie-cutter shounen anime that has little to no redeeming value. Even the worst of 5D&#039;s is far better than the best of GX. I&#039;d rather watch the Pre-WRGP arc of 5D&#039;s which is 90% filler over a ten-episode stretch of GX. <br />
I honestly do not understand how anybody legitimately enjoys this series.

    Yu-Gi-Oh! GX had big shoes to fill, being the second series (and a sequel in-universe to) the iconic first season of duel monsters. It took a lot of risks to create its own identity as opposed to going the Pokemon route and recycling the characters and plot while changing the setting, which can be alienating to people who grew up on DM and likely led to its polarizing reception at the time.<br />
<br />
On the surface, GX feels like somewhat of an affectionate parody of the original, especially in the dub. The first episodes of the first season take the premise of yugioh and largely play it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354136">
        for comedy, as it slowly edges into darker waters and deconstructs both the premise of the original show as while as the characters it built up over several seasons. While the shift in tone can feel very sudden, the show generally handles it well.<br />
<br />
The best part of GX is definitely its characters. Most of the characters are designed to appear to be like the original cast of characters, but with a twist. The main rival acts like Kaiba at first, but the rivalry is never serious and he quickly develops his own character. The token girl of the cast actually gets to be a strong duelist, although this unfortunately isn&#039;t shown too much. In general, the characters in this show are fantastic, but the supporting cast doesn&#039;t get to advance the plot too much despite the scores of character development. Standouts include Jaden/Judai, Zane/Ryo, and Dr. Crowler, but most of the main recurring cast qualifies.<br />
<br />
While it&#039;s difficult to say why without spoiling, the four seasons/arcs are all solid in their own ways. The first season takes a while to get going, but each of the antagonists of the arc are fun in their own way, be it comedic, threatening, or something else, and this season more than any other shows off the wide range of characters in the show as duelists, with multiple supporting characters landing plot-important wins and multiple duels. The second season is paced much better, with the story starting almost immediately and being woven into the smaller acts of the season, growing until it becomes too big to ignore in-universe  and leading to some fantastic moments. The supporting cast continues to grow both in number and development, with several episodes apiece for most of them.<br />
<br />
The third season is where the show takes a different turn. It spends the first two seasons building up its cast of characters and plot conventions, and then spends an entire season deconstructing them, especially the lead character. It&#039;s very dark, and the tone shift can be quite jarring, but it&#039;s well worth the ride once you  adjust. The villain of this season can be pretty divisive, but is overall enjoyable, as are the rest of the new characters with the standout being Johan/Jesse. <br />
<br />
The final season, which was never dubbed, is extremely difficult to talk about without spoiling anything. You&#039;ll either love it or you&#039;ll hate it, but overall I personally loved it.<br />
<br />
While the sub is obviously the best choice, the dub for the first two seasons isn&#039;t bad and fits with the more light-hearted nature of the show at that point quite well. <br />
<br />
And lastly, if you care about lgbt+ representation/subtext, there&#039;s a canonically intersex character, and in the sub the main character&#039;s orientation is speculated on in universe, with a ton of (barely) subtext that the dub downplayed but didn&#039;t remove.<br />
<br />
Overall, Yugioh GX is different. Very different from the original, and if you don&#039;t like it, that&#039;s fine. But if you stick around to watch it you&#039;ll find a show that&#039;s just as good as, if not better than the original.

    Yu-Gi-Oh GX, how I love you so! I don&#039;t know why this is one of the most hated Yu-Gi-Oh series, because in my opinion, it&#039;s the best! I&#039;m not quite sure why, but perhaps it&#039;s my nostalgia for it. Of course, the original Yu-Gi-Oh is a VERY close second to this for me, but for some reason this kind of just takes the cake. Let me give this a quick review.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
It&#039;s Yu-Gi-Oh. Don&#039;t expect a deep plot obviously, because there won&#039;t be one. It&#039;s about people playing a children&#039;s card game for fun and to be the best, but there are also a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257147">
        of villains that appear that have the power to steal souls! It&#039;s not bad, but it&#039;s silly, don&#039;t you think? That&#039;s why I give the story a 6, which is fair. But surprisingly, there actually are some pretty damn deep moments within the anime, some of which could maybe even make me cry!<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
The art is very nice to look at. There are some continuity errors at times with the wrong card being displayed on the duel disk, but nobody really cares about that, anyway, right? Regardless, the art style is nice but it&#039;s nothing groundbreaking.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
The OST is actually really good! The intro is really catchy, and a lot of the music that plays in really serious and dark moments is VERY creepy and cool! It definitely really adds to the theme of the show!<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
<br />
Probably Yu-Gi-Oh GX&#039;s best trait are the characters. It has a very lovable main character with many lovable side characters, and some really cool and interesting villains! I think that the characters are the reason why I prefer this to the original. I just think that they were a bit better for some reason.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll always keep coming back to this anime and watching some of the epic duels. The show can be hilarious at times, and overall it&#039;s just a lot of fun to watch! Maybe not so much if you didn&#039;t grow up watching it though. If you watched the original Yu-Gi-Oh as a child and didn&#039;t watch this, and you tried watching this, you probably wouldn&#039;t like it at all, because it&#039;s quite a lot different and more light-hearted.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a deep psychological anime or anything, and it does have quite a few continuity errors, but those can be ignored. For example, a lot of the card effects differ from how they work in real life, along with some of the game mechanics. Also, there are some instances when Jaden only uses a card once or twice, and then it&#039;s never seen from again. It makes you wonder where it went! But yeah, definitely watch it if you love the Yu-Gi-Oh series in general, because you&#039;re missing out if you skipped over this. Seriously, it&#039;s great. Quirky, funny, cool, and overall just a great anime!<br />
