    I don&#039;t normally tend to point fingers at people, but just this once I feel like I need to get some things off my chest here.<br />
<br />
Almost every single season nowadays, it seems there has to be a scapegoat. An anime which you are somehow obliged to publically hate on or you&#039;ll be looked down upon by the community and no one will take you seriously. I&#039;m honestly sick of this kind of group pressure/bandwagon mentality. We&#039;re now halfway through the year 2017 and yet hating on popular stuff over the internet is somehow still considered to be the coolest and best thing since sliced bread.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250858">
        *Especially* when it&#039;s gross, creepy and immoral shit made for closet pedos, am I right? Shows like this really bring out the most toxic sides of the anime community.<br />

When you have an anime which totally wears its heart on its sleeve and doesn&#039;t try to hide its true intentions in any way, why is it that so many people seemingly insist on still making themselves watch it even when it&#039;s clear as day that they&#039;re not going to like it and that they&#039;re not part of the target audience? Eromanga-sensei is one of the most blatantly polarizing series in the last few seasons, and quite frankly you should be able to easily figure out whether you will enjoy it or not just from reading the synopsis and by considering the fact that it is written by the same author as Oreimo.<br />
<br />
In short, Eromanga-sensei features the following:<br />
- A glimpse into the life of a young, aspiring light novel author in Japan<br />
- Lots of references to other anime, light novels, the industry itself and more<br />
- Pseudo-incestuous relationship themes (they&#039;re not actually blood-related)<br />
- Somewhat trope-filling and eccentric characters<br />
- Cutesy moe-style heroines<br />
- Frequent suggestive shots of various middle school girls<br />
- An abundance of romcom clichés and sexual gags<br />
- Memes<br />
- Cameos of characters from Oreimo<br />
- The perfect setup for providing tons of juicy ero-fanart and doujins<br />
<br />
Now if you have a problem with several of these themes, you don&#039;t need to watch this anime. It really isn&#039;t any more complicated than that. It is clearly not for you, and you don&#039;t need to go out of your way to force yourself to watch it just so you can go on a lengthy rant afterwards about how trashy it is, how it is &quot;pandering to otaku&quot;, label it as &quot;pedo-bait&quot; or anything along those lines. If you&#039;re not even part of an anime&#039;s target demographic then quite frankly you have no business trash-talking it for not adhering to your own standards—the problem lies entirely on your end in that case. Criticizing an anime for its execution is logical—criticizing an anime for merely belonging to a certain genre is not. You don&#039;t need to go on the aggressive from the safe place behind your monitor just to feel better about yourself. If your sole reason for watching an anime is to make fun of and insult the people enjoying it, you really need to get your priorities straight. Even more curious are some comments I&#039;ve seen basically saying &quot;i-it&#039;s not like I enjoy watching this terrible anime or anything, don&#039;t get the wrong idea, baka!&quot;, as if implying that either their morals or the group pressure is preventing them from admitting to themselves that they actually like it. Give me a break already.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, as someone who actually does enjoy those kinds of themes and absolutely loves imoutos in general, Eromanga-sensei is a pretty solid anime that does just about all the simplistic things I could ask of it. It&#039;s cute, light-hearted, decently funny at times, has a lot of sexy shots of ero-kawaii and energetic moe girls, and is just plain fun and enjoyable in general. And as a result, what you have is a thoroughly entertaining anime despite everything. Yes, that is in fact all that&#039;s needed, as shocking as that might be for some people to believe.<br />
<br />
In short, Eromanga-sensei follows the lives of a high school light novel author named Izumi Masamune and his hikikomori little sister Sagiri, who somewhat secretly works as an erotic illustrator for his novels amongst other things under the pen name Eromanga-sensei. The story follows both their struggles with their respective jobs as well as their relationship with each other as step siblings. There are also a number of other girls involved in one way or another, primarily the eccentric Yamada Elf who is also a top-selling light novel author, as well as the even more successful Senju Muramasa who on top of being an author is also Masamune&#039;s biggest fan. There&#039;s also Sagiri&#039;s pushy classmate Jinno Megumi who keeps trying to find ways to convince Sagiri to leave her room and go to school for once. It&#039;s a simple setup overall, but it serves as an easy way to get the protagonist and the various girls intimately involved with each other on both a personal and professional level, which is a good thing since the main selling point of Eromanga-sensei is the characters&#039; interactions with each other.<br />
<br />
As you can probably tell, it is all quite similar to Oreimo in not just the incestuous themes but the type of chemistry between the main characters and the side characters as well. And as it happens, they generally fulfill somewhat similar roles too. Just like Kirino, Sagiri is here the otaku imouto with a rather perverted hobby who is also quite obviously in love with her Onii-chan. In terms of personality though, they&#039;re very different from each other. Whereas Kirino was an outgoing honors student and a rather extreme tsundere, Sagiri is shy, reclusive and more of a dandere than anything, and she gets embarrassed easily whenever she&#039;s not hiding behind the mask of her online Eromanga-sensei persona. But perhaps most importantly, just like Kirino, Sagiri is incredibly sexy. The vast majority of the show&#039;s fanservice is centered on her in the form of various suggestive shots of her inside her room, but it&#039;s done in a rather smooth and natural way so it doesn&#039;t feel out of place. It&#039;s the type of eroticism which greatly enhances an anime&#039;s enjoyment value in my mind; the kind that makes you repeatedly pause the video to rape the screenshot button for academic purposes. I appreciate it quite a lot. It&#039;s no wonder that Sagiri has already been crowned the clear ero-fanart queen of the season by the Japanese portion of the internet, as is quite evident if you go visit just about any major anime image board at the moment (which is also a bit ironic considering that drawing such pictures is literally what Sagiri does for a living herself).<br />
<br />
Similarly, if Sagiri is supposed to be &quot;the new&quot; Kirino, then you&#039;d also have to argue that Elf is the new Kuroneko. Elf is the energetic and weird yet funny girl of the show, being an immensely talented writer but also a rather lazy one who only sees her work as a hobby, and thus only writes whenever she feels like it, much to the dismay of her editors. Furthermore, she&#039;s also a bit of a chuuni nutcase who consistently does stupid things for the amusement of all. As a result, while she&#039;s not quite as sexualized as Sagiri is, overall I would still say Elf is the most likable and entertaining girl of Eromanga-sensei due to how enjoyable her personality is. In other words it&#039;s pretty much the same story as with Oreimo where (in my opinion) Kuroneko was ultimately the best girl even though Kirino was sexy as hell. For all the old Ayase fans out there though, I&#039;m sorry to say but there isn&#039;t really a replacement for her in Eromanga-sensei. Instead we have Muramasa taking the role of the third love rival, but she&#039;s not particularly similar. If anything she&#039;s the most publically affectionate towards Masamune out of the trio, but for rather... questionable reasons.<br />
<br />
As far as the story itself goes, the viewers are pretty much told from the beginning that this will eventually head down the pseudo-incest route as Masamune and Sagiri are evidentially in love with each other and Masamune makes it quite clear on numerous occasions that she is the only girl he has eyes for. While he is still a little bit dense at times, Masamune at least has the guts to confess that he is in love with Sagiri from quite early on in the series, which is pretty commendable considering their relationship. However, it will probably take a while before that ship really sets sail, because in this (first?) season alone, there isn&#039;t really much in the way of romantic progression beyond that confession. It is more of a standard romcom in terms of execution thus far, but certainly not a bad one. Meanwhile we also have the ongoing subplot of the siblings trying to create the supposed &quot;greatest light novel ever&quot; together where Masamune writes the story and Sagiri draws the illustrations. It reminds me a bit of Bakuman in that sense, but of course it&#039;s not quite as forefront about it here. However, this subplot is most certainly something that really asks for a sequel one day.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the biggest problem with Eromanga-sensei though is that despite everything, Masamune and Sagiri aren&#039;t actually blood-related. The main appeal of incest in anime to me is the general taboo feeling of it, you know: &quot;it&#039;s forbidden, therefore it&#039;s exciting&quot; and all. Making them step-siblings instead is thus both a bit of a boner-killer as well as a cop-out move by the author, and it kind of feels like the anime goes out of its way to remind the audience of this annoying fact a few too many times. However, if you&#039;re familiar with the infamous ending of Oreimo and more importantly the backstory behind why that happened in the first place, this was most likely a conscious decision by the author in order to make sure the same thing won&#039;t happen a second time around. Oreimo was kind of ruined by its terrible ending, so having the knowledge that at least Eromanga-sensei won&#039;t suffer the same fate is a bit of a relief. I just wish he didn&#039;t have to sacrifice part of the show&#039;s main appeal to ensure this part, but I guess SJWs are unfortunately just that powerful in today&#039;s society.<br />
<br />
You probably shouldn&#039;t compare everything to Oreimo though—after all this is just as much of a standalone work as that was—but considering that even the main characters of Oreimo makes appearances in Eromanga-sensei, they&#039;re not only similar but evidentially also take place in the same universe and time span. For what it&#039;s worth though, minus its ending I would still probably say Oreimo was slightly better not only because of the blood-relation issue, but there was also more of a struggle there due to Kirino&#039;s conservative father being fully against her otaku hobbies, whereas in Eromanga-sensei, Masamune&#039;s parents are both conveniently absent from their house. It all feels a bit easier in Eromanga-sensei, which is not inherently a bad thing mind you but I think it makes it a little bit less unique. Then again, as they say: &quot;if it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it&quot;.<br />
<br />
As far as the production values goes, the animation (done by A-1 Pictures) is... okay, I guess? Nothing out of the ordinary but enough for the girls to always look attractive, which is about all that&#039;s required in this case. On top of that, both the OP and ED of Eromanga-sensei are honestly great; they&#039;re both incredibly catchy tunes that easily stand out as among the best from this season.<br />
<br />
Overall, Eromanga-sensei is a simplistic, cliché and quite lewd romcom which will surely turn off a lot of people due to its themes, but it excels at doing the exact things it sets out to do for its own specific target audience, and thus at least for me it was one of the more enjoyable shows of the season.<br />
<br />
I also find it a bit ironic how other shows like New Game for example (which I also really liked) get to receive general praise from the community for doing nothing but showing cute moe girls working in the entertainment media industry, mixed with comedy and fanservice, yet Eromanga-sensei is receiving so much hate for doing basically the exact same thing? Hypocrisy at its finest. Are the incest themes really *that* big of a deal? Or is it the supposed ages of the girls? I mean really now? I can&#039;t help but feel legitimately sorry for people who let something like that ruin their enjoyment of an anime.

    Something I find hilarious is that no one can explain why Eromanga Sensei is a good show. I see people giving this an 8-10 rating and saying it&#039;s a good show, but not once I&#039;ve seen anyone mentioning any legitimate good quality about Eromanga except for: &quot;it&#039;s cute&quot;, &quot;Sagiri is so cute&quot;, &quot;it has cute girls&quot;, &quot;incest is wincest&quot;. This may be unfair since I shouldn&#039;t be trashing on anyone&#039;s likings and I believe people have the right to enjoy whatever the hell they like, but I cannot shake the annoyance that some people are just satisfied with anything at this point. Trust me, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246562">
        like cute girls and lolis as much as the next guy does, but somewhere somehow we need to draw the line and notice when our intelligence is being insulted. Does the only thing that an anime needs is for it to have cute girls, some type of incestuous relationship, a copy/paste generic protagonist (that took no effort to create), a bunch of terribly forced memes and loli fanservice for us anime fans to be all over it on social media and be supporting this garbage? If this isn&#039;t an insult to the viewer&#039;s intelligence then I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
<br />
For those of you who do not know, this story was done by the same people who made the highly controversial Light Novel (later adapted into an anime), My Little Sister Can&#039;t be this Cute (better known as OreImo). Apart from targeting a niche audience with the sibling romance subplot, OreImo is infamous for receiving harsh backlash from fans upon its completion for its trash ending. Details were revealed that the LN editors did not allow Tsukasa Fushimi to go through with a full incest ending.<br />
<br />
Keeping this in mind, it becomes very apparent that Eromanga Sensei is trying to be OreImo. Not only does this series do a terrible job at copying all the elements that made OreImo successful, but it makes sure to establish the single fact that led to the downfall of the show. It utilizes one of the most used loopholes sibling romances do to get away with what they&#039;re doing by making sure everyone knows that the two main characters ARE NOT BLOOD-RELATED. Did you hear that? THEY&#039;RE NOT BLOOD-RELATED. The previews make sure you know this, the manga makes sure you know this, the anime makes damn sure you know this.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe anyone genuinely thinks Eromanga Sensei will not have the brother &amp; sister get it on at some point. It only takes a fraction of knowledge about the author, OreImo and its history to know this has been created just because the author hasn&#039;t gotten over his sister fetish. Even so, there are a bunch of other female characters (not)worth mentioning. The thing is, none of these characters seem remotely interesting or feel like real people. They&#039;re walking anime tropes that will only exist for the purpose of having the main guy hang around with other girls than his sister and to let the audience have a bit of variety. I have checked the manga and there is no indication they will get interesting enough to carry this bad comedy.<br />
<br />
I found it very sickening how cynical and shamelessly Eromanga Sensei tries to bait the siscon/lolicon audience. Countless promising shots of the girls (especially the FREAKING 10-YEAR-OLD) are shown to obviously excite the viewer and trust me, I don&#039;t want to be the normie guy who trashes the sexualization of kids in anime, but these are literally middle schoolers. Like, this show is WAY too in your face with fanservice shots. Only 4 episodes in and we&#039;ve basically seen the little sister naked at least 3 times already. It doesn&#039;t even try to hide the fact that they want to attract &quot;that&quot; type of audience, and what bothers me is that they&#039;re so out of place. Eromanga Sensei does this so much I&#039;m kinda creeped out that full grown men have such cynical mentality to attract people into their mediocre show with a few ass/breast shots of little girls (if this was an ecchi series I could understand, but Eromanga is not). Every episode gets so much worse with the fanservice it reaches to a point that is just absurd, even for modern anime standards. I honestly feel like I need to call the cops ASAP while watching Eromanga Sensei, just for witnessing the amount of pedophilic vibes this series gives off. If you&#039;re into that stuff, then knock yourself out I guess...<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk a little bit more about the characters: they all suck. Every single one gets on my nerve, and the one who doesn&#039;t (the black haired who works as a librarian) is so uninteresting it&#039;s shocking. First off, the main girl is the lolicon&#039;s/siscon&#039;s dream imouto, a ridiculously cute, empty shell of a girl who&#039;s only noteworthy characteristics are that acts like a tsundere, refuses to leave her room and draws porn for fun. The main guy is generic MC #198,567 (he&#039;s voiced by Kirito ffs) who has a terrifying obsession with his sister. People accuse Kyouske of being a terrible siscon, but Masamune is on another level. When he&#039;s not screaming, he&#039;s ranting on how beautiful his 10-year-old sister is and you can just feel this guy wants to bang her brains out. OreImo at least had the decency to slowly develop the sibling romance, and most of the side characters were interesting and felt like real people (Kuroneko alone makes OreImo a better show btw). The other characters in Eromanga Sensei are stock templates and not worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
People criticize OreImo for being a bad anime with nothing new to say, and solely aimed at the siscon/lolicon otaku audience. I find these allegations funny because I&#039;ve seen those same people dare to claim this is better than OreImo. Unlike Eromanga Sensei, OreImo HAD something to say (nothing that hasn&#039;t been explored, but nevertheless it was something). In part, OreImo&#039;s first season had a couple interesting themes like the exploration on otaku culture in Japan, the difficulties of liking something that is heavily looked down upon in society and those around you, and the evolving friendship (ultimately romantic interest) between two different types of siblings. Eromanga Sensei, on the other hand, is a soulless, empty copy of its predecessor that could only appeal to the type of people it is obviously intended for. <br />
<br />
One of the things that bothered me the most about Eromanga Sensei is that it tries so damn hard to create memes. This show is just asking, BEGGING to be the next meme on Twitter. From having a character&#039;s first trait being that &quot;SHE LOVES DICKS&quot;, to having the main loli have a cute (completely out of character) dance at the beginning and opening themes that is begging you with red letters to make a gif out of it and share it with your friends. The show constantly has looping, cute or &quot;funny&quot; moments that are obviously intended to be the laugh of the week (this isn&#039;t Konosuba, so it doesn&#039;t work). Since the show is trying so hard to be a meme, I propose we treat it as such. The meme of the season. <br />
<br />
Well, I have nothing more to say in this unorganized rant. I really needed to get this anger I have towards this show off my chest somehow and hopefully open some eyes. If you have nothing to watch this season, maybe you would want to check out Eromanga Sensei. Watching one episode a week is more easy to pass than when a series is completed (it&#039;s the only reason why I might watch some more; also to possibly rant about it some more in the future). However, expect a &quot;moe-blob&quot; of a series that shamelessly copies its big brother and all the cliches of the industry. As I indirectly suggest throughout this review, if you want to watch a similar show done by the same people and with the same ideas, watch OreImo if you haven&#039;t and do not waste your time on this. It has a more refreshing and interesting cast than Eromanga, it connects much better with the ideas it&#039;s trying to present and is overall more presentable than this garbage. The thing that bothers me the most is that Eromanga Sensei is becoming extremely popular amongst anime fans. To my understanding, it has been very successful in preorder sales in Japan and it is very talked about in online communities. Yes, all those meme attempts have been working so far, and people are loving the ass shots of Sagiri and Megumi saying she loves dicks. This motivates the industry into producing more of this quality of anime, and we all know anime deserves much better. All I can say is that I really hope Eromanga Sensei gets forgotten after the season ends and it&#039;s remembered as the cheap theatrics it is, or at least I hope so.<br />
<br />
This series is my proof that every day we stray further from Kamisama, and that Miyazaki-sensei was right about anime all along.

    For better and for worse (mostly worse), Eromanga-sensei is the successor to OreImo and its themes of sister-banging. But where OreImo had some interesting things to say about the otaku community, Eromanga-sensei possesses nothing, and is nothing, puerile and creatively bankrupt. <br />
<br />
Eromanga-sensei in many ways represents everything that is bad with light novels. It is a story (I guess, if we put aside its flagrantly incestual nature) of a group of twelve-to-fifteen-year-olds who are famous artists, as if adults do not and cannot exist. If Eromanga-sensei was taking inspiration from the scribbles of a bunch of middle school students, its rubbish writing would actually make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250878">
        a great deal of sense.<br />
<br />
Stop me if you&#039;ve heard this one before: the protagonist and a sexy lady, both being inexperienced in the affairs of love, try to imitate romantic situations with one another as a source of creative inspiration. No? How about the protagonist&#039;s rival conveniently being revealed as a cute girl who is desperately in love with him? Or the heroine angrily retreating to her room and screaming &quot;bakaaa!&quot; as the camera pans away? See, Eromanga-sensei isn&#039;t an anime that is particularly concerned with sharing anything you haven&#039;t already seen in dozens or hundreds of other equally brain-dead romantic comedies. (And seriously, if I have to watch another anime with a hikikomori heroine who is portrayed as some goddess of attraction, I&#039;m going to have an aneurysm.)<br />
<br />
I suppose the difference here is that Eromanga-sensei is neither romantic nor comedic. It sure as hell is not funny (unless you are the type who thinks burping is the pinnacle of comedic genius), and its &#039;romance&#039; is merely a thinly-veiled attempt to make it seem somewhat less like masturbation fodder. Fodder which, by the way, has a regularly sexualised heroine who is only twelve-years-old. Let that sink in for a second: twelve-years-old. She is twelve, and the anime frequently displays detailed shots of her ass, her panties, her naked body, and so forth, and even thinks it is amusing to have her friend (who is the same age, by the way) howling about how she loves penises. Yeah. Really. <br />
<br />
Even if lolicon pornography does not bother you, it would be an impossible task to claim this contributes to the story or the characters in any meaningful way. It actively sabotages whatever emotional value it tries to create between Sagiri and Masumune&#039;s relationship, and makes it impossible to take seriously anything that happens or could conceivably happen. For example, the anime will reveal Masamune&#039;s tragic past in the span of about one minute, and then immediately open the next episode with a girl clad in her bikini and flirting with him. Eromanga-sensei doesn&#039;t even do the incest part right since it is more concerned with creating some periphery harem for Masamune than it is with developing his feelings for Sagiri beyond &quot;hey I like you lol.&quot; It is stupid on the level of KonoSuba and yet has the audacity to pretend without a hint of sarcasm that it is some touching story. No.<br />
<br />
It is actually a fairly sad result when compared to the author&#039;s previous work, OreImo. OreImo, flawed and infuriating as it was, actually put a great deal of time into making Kirino and Kyosuke&#039;s feelings for one another feel meaningful. Kirino was no doubt insufferable, but by the end, you could at least look at her as something more than an assortment of tropes and incest appeal. Likewise, it also went into a fair amount of detail with regards to the life of a stereotypical otaku. It represented Comiket, eroge, offline meetings, and the conflict people can have when they possess hobbies they are ashamed of. It was no Genshikan, but OreImo did at least try to contribute something to the industry with more appeal than &quot;well, gee, banging your sister sounds like a fun idea.&quot; <br />
<br />
The same cannot be said for Eromanga-sensei, which does and says nothing about the industry. Any moment when it does display the struggles of Masamune&#039;s career, it is extremely, unbearably dull, and often propelled by silly plot devices like one of his love interests offering all their royalties in return for Masamune becoming their slave. The whole premise of being a light novel author is an accessory that may as well not even exist. If you stripped all the fanservice away, all that would expose is the show&#039;s unsightly skeleton. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t think of any situation where Eromanga-sensei could come as a recommendation. It is asinine dreck, without so much as a modicum of creativity. I suppose its colourful art and catchy opening animation may lead some people into thinking the anime is more than it truly is, but it is best to be honest: the sole reason anyone likes this show is because they want to bone the twelve-year-old heroine. <br />
<br />
Now how much merit is there in a story like that?<br />
<br />
I&#039;d wager not a whole not.

    Eromanga-sensei is a culmination of everything I hate in lazy, insipid, vacuous, pandering entertainment. Now, to clarify, first of all, I don&#039;t believe that just because an anime, or any piece of entertainment, panders towards a certain demographic, that it is inherently bad necessarily. There has been plenty of anime that pander towards the otaku audience while, at the same time, remaining fun, and some instances, good shows, but Eromanga-sensei is not such an example. It&#039;s a show that lives by the convention in terms of its plot structure, comedy, character archetypes and dives head first into trashiness at any moment it can get. What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250866">
        could have been an interesting look into why and how people who shut themselves inside their homes live on a daily basis, akin to something along the lines of Welcome to the N.H.K or something, the show just decides to opt out instead for loli fan-service instead, ditching anything that made Oreimo, somewhat enjoyable, and, in some parts, decent. Before I continue, I&#039;d just like to clarify that I am not hating on this show just because the original creator also created Oreimo. As I just said, I found that show to be decent (until the ending anyway) but it also had a few things that I could appreciate when it comes to meta humour about otaku and the anime industry as a whole. Eromanga-sensei has none of that. It&#039;s pointless, empty and has no value as a show at all. It&#039;s trash in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
Now, before I dive into the numerous reasons as of why I believe this show to be as poor as I think it is, let&#039;s discuss the plot first of all. Masamune is a somewhat successful, trashy light novel author who has been writing for several years now to support his younger step-sister, Sagiri, a shut-in, t, who refuses to go out and stamps on the floor of her bedroom whenever she wants anything. While Masamune writes these books and even has illustrations done for him, he doesn&#039;t actually know who this illustrator actually is, who goes by the name &#039;Eromanga-sensei&#039; who actually turns out to be Sagiri herself! That&#039;s right! A 13-year-old girl draws erotic pictures! Oh boy! Anyway, the rest of the show sees Masamune and Sagiri begin to bond and grow closer together, while splicing in some romance between the two (because that&#039;s needed between siblings, am I right?) while Masamune is challenged by numerous other light novel authors in the business for slots in magazines, eventually becoming their friends and going along their merry way. The show&#039;s narrative is incredibly simple and boring to boot since there is no objective or even direction in the story. It moves awkwardly from scene to scene with no sense of flow or reasoning behind any of the characters and the entire show just feels like one big filler arc from a long-running shounen series or something. Now, I&#039;m not saying that all anime need some kind of story, especially if it is going for comedy, but Eromanga&#039;s comedy in itself is poor, repetitive and so predictable, mostly derivative from seeing characters becoming embarrassed at removing their clothing, or from juvenile misunderstandings. One such example is a joke centred around a gay misunderstanding, in which another light novel author believes that Masamune is gay and has the hots for him, resulting in some of the most dreadful gags in the show. It feels like a 14-year-old wrote the entire thing, which is ironic, considering that I can only imagine that demographic finding this sort of weak comedy actually funny. <br />
<br />
Sagiri&#039;s problem of being a shut-in was the only, the ONLY thing that the show had going for it and it throws it out so fast! I was genuinely interested to see what the show may do with this element; perhaps comment on the bigger picture of shut-ins in Japan perhaps, or delve into the psychological reasons behind this character&#039;s reasoning for why she has to say inside, but nope! They ditch this element and Masamune doesn&#039;t even try and help her with this issue at all and instead panders towards. He doesn&#039;t try to make her see why this is a problem, nor does his try to help her go into the outside world or anything. Sagiri is there just to be cute and that&#039;s it! We hardly learn anything about her as a person and she is such a brat that I can&#039;t stand every moment that she is on screen. Like most bad shows, the anime attempts to throw incest into the mix, and it comes across as so forced and disgusting. As someone who has three little sisters myself, one of which isn&#039;t actually related to me by blood, the thought of Masamune and Sagiri entering into a romantic relationship generally disgusts me to no end and all I hear people shout is &quot;INCEST IS WINCEST&quot; constantly, actually hoping the two will get together in the end. I also just hate the general excuse of &quot;oh! They&#039;re not related by blood, so it&#039;s fine!&quot;. No, it&#039;s not. It&#039;s just as creepy and strange. To me, this aspect of the show baffles me, and I&#039;ve never understood the appeal of little sisters in anime. This problem is also highlighted by the fact that we have young 13-year-old girls proclaiming that they love dicks out in public, just for all of the filthy weebs to rub their dicks at the thoughts of seeing this in action or something. <br />
<br />
One of the things the show has received a lot of flak for is the excessive amounts of loli fan-service all around; most of the cast consists of young girls, who are consistently put into revealing swimsuits or underwear. Now, I don&#039;t necessarily have any problem with fan-service in a series, as long as it serves some kind of purpose or is not intrusive on the narrative at any point. <br />
It feels like Eromanga-sensei&#039;s fan-service scenes were made for the sole purpose of padding the episodes out and the whiplash from seeing a bunch of kids half naked, to a heartfelt speech about love is so jarring that it makes each one of these scenes an absolute chore to watch since you know that nothing is happening and is just killing time. Not only that, but the situations the show sets up for its fan service feels just as equally as contrived and weak, and it&#039;s not like the fan-service by itself is even that alluring either as the animation and art style is rather generic and uninspired. While not a good show by any stretch, the currently airing Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai, is a much better example of a fan-service vehicle since it is full frontal with its trashiness and doesn&#039;t try to hide underneath the pretence of being any more than that like Eromanga-sensei does with its terrible attempt of sounding more emotional and deep. The show has a plethora of more emotional moments and speeches between each of its characters, all of which are generic, but the main problem is that they feel like a cheap attempt at making these characters have more depth than they actually have. Nowhere is this more evident than in the penultimate episode of the show, where we learn that Masamune and Sagiri were contacting each other over the internet even before they met and formally became siblings. This twist feels needlessly convenient and lazy. That&#039;s the best word I can use to summarise this show: it&#039;s lazy. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the characters, every single one are essentially archetypes of already existing characters that have been done to much better effect in the past. As such, I often inadvertently find myself comparing them to similar characters, even when I dislike doing so as I wish to treat each piece of media as its own thing. Masamune is your generic main lead, who has a kind soul, is a hard, earnest worker, has a soft voice while getting embarrassed and flustered whenever a girl is revealing any clothing within his proximity. Oh, and every girl falls in love with him, just because the plot demands them to do so! Sagiri, likewise, has very little to offer in terms of character or personality. As I have already mentioned, I disliked this character, with a burning passion! She is so selfish, and acts so much like a brat, screaming &quot;ONII-CHAN IS A BAKA!&quot; at the top of her lungs that I feel like reaching through the monitor of my laptop and slapping her in her face. While, yes, she does warm up to her big brother to a certain extent (a little too much if you know what I mean) her character is just incredibly stale and unoriginal. She has no merits at all, and as I have already discussed, any possible potential for her development in regards to her shut-in problem is thrown completely out the window because the show is too lazy to even have one decent idea. We do learn the back-stories to both Sagiri and Masamune, something I can appreciate, it feels so tacked on and forced that it leaves no impact, and, instead, feels like, again, a lazy and cheap way for the audience to care about these two without building up their characters at all. A sad and tragic back-story is a good way to make a character feel tragic and helps the audience empathise with them, but the character also has to develop too and, at the same time, be well written, which this show fails at.<br />
<br />
Despite my hatred for Sagari (and little sisters in anime in general), even she is nowhere near as bad as Yamada Elf! She is another light novel author, only this time, stuck up her own ass, believing she is the greatest thing that has ever walked on the planet. She is also extremely selfish, but also EXTREMELY annoying to watch, due to her actions and her voice actress. Hell, one of our earliest introductions to her character is when she is playing the piano in her house while also being completely naked at the same time! Thanks, Eromanga-sensei, I am, as everyone else is, now on the FBI watch list. Oh boy. While her character does eventually confess her love for our dry-as-wood main protagonist, her character arc (or lack of character as a whole) goes nowhere. Her only point in the narrative is fan-service, and that&#039;s it. She is not interesting, fun to watch and every scene she was in only drew me closer to kicking the chair from beneath my feet to taste the sweet release of death from this shitty world. The only somewhat decent character is Muramasa, another girl who falls for Mr Light Novel Guy (our protagonist) and the only character who has some reasoning and justification into her love for him. As a whole, the characters themselves are very weak and the comedic chemistry the show attempts to build between them doesn&#039;t work at all, and, again, feels so trite and forced to boot. <br />
<br />
The overall aesthetic is just fine, very typical of what you&#039;d expect from A-1 Pictures. The character designs were somewhat cute (so much so that one of my friends said he would &#039;destroy&#039; Sagairi if you catch my drift) but it just feels so mundane and &#039;safe&#039;. The same thing can be said about the music too. While the opening and ending track were both fine (especially the ending track which was both catchy as hell, and, admittedly cute seeing Sagairi dance despite how much I hate her) the music as a whole is horribly generic, which, at the very least, is consistent with the show.<br />
<br />
Now, one thing people may say in defence of the show is that you&#039;re supposed to just enjoy it and not take anything seriously since the show doesn&#039;t really take itself seriously at all. With its outlook on the workers of the light novel industry, it presents its characters as all being rather incompetent and it seems to acknowledge, to some degree, that these writers are indeed bad, but tries to excuse and justify this by claiming that the stories are interesting to read. This philosophy presented in the show may also arise in arguments in favour of the show, which, I guess is fine, but I didn&#039;t find anything about this show interesting at all, and certainly not entertaining. The comedy is extremely weak, the characters are boring archetypes that go nowhere and the entire show sexualises young girls to ridiculous degrees. Yes, the show is somewhat self-aware of how trashy it is, but just because it is so, doesn&#039;t make the anime any good. In fact, it only makes it worse since it does nothing else to subvert or go against these troupes presented in the show, and instead decides to go down the lazy route, and just appeal to the lowest common denominator. Now, I want to make it clear now, that I do not begrudge anyone for actually enjoying this show, as the tone in this review may suggest otherwise. I honestly am glad if you managed to find enjoyment in a show that I found so repulsive, and more power to you because of that. But, for me, this show was abysmal in every possible way, and I&#039;ll be seeing you all in prison when the FBI eventually tracks us all down...<br />

    After watching Eromanga Sensei my eyes have opened of how most modern anime from 2015+ have been dumbed down in terms of story and characters.<br />
We have been recently getting a lot of shows that either decent or downright bad that have no real impact on the anime industry.<br />
Sure we got some great and memorable shows such as 3 Gatsu no Lion Assassination Classroom, Shokugeki no Souma, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju and Little Witch Academia (TV) but at the same time, we had to deal with mediocre to awful shows like Charlotte, Gangsta, Berserk 2016/2017, Scum&#039;s Wish etc.<br />
Now do I think for Eromanga Sensei. Is it a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250870">
        modern masterpiece or it&#039;s a train-wreck that represents everything wrong with modern anime?<br />
<br />
Spoiler alert this show is a dumpster fire that shouldn&#039;t seen the light of day.<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
The story of Eromanga Sensei is very similar to Bakuman as it follows a guy named Masamune who is a light novel author in high school. Masamune has a sister named Sagirl. A hikikomori girl who hasn&#039;t left her room for an entire year. Sagirl forces her brother to bring meals for her as well as washing her clothes. Masamune&#039;s novel illustrator, Eromanga likes to draw extremely perverted drawings who is very reliable.<br />
It&#039;s later revealed that Eromanga-Sensei is actually his younger sister. Now Masasume must bond with her sister so she can get out of her room as well as making a novel together.<br />
<br />
Now imagine Bakuman but with a poorly written story, cringe-worthy characters and Oreimo 2 dialogue and you got yourself Eromanga Sensei. A shit show filled with creepy incest with no substance whatsoever.<br />
As much I hate to admit it Oreimo Season 1 has some good theme exploration and social topics such as okatu cloture, hiding hobbies that you love from other people due to bad reputation from society and bonding with your family member.<br />
Eromanga Sensei has no themes, no artistic value, no message and no point other to be another shitty okatu pandering show with no soul whatsoever.<br />
<br />
This is actual dialogue...<br />
The writing in the show is downright abysmal that is filled with cringe-worthy and awkward the dialogue that insults the viewer&#039;s intelligence in many ways.<br />
One example of this horrific dialogue is in episode 5 where Elf asks Sagirl to make an illustrator of her if she shows her panties on a webcam where it can be possibly be tracked down by police. Instead of saying no and leaving the video chat like a normal person with a brain she shows her panties on the webcam.<br />
That scene gets followed up with horrendous jail-bait dialogue...<br />
Who the hell wrote this shit seriously!?!?<br />
Overall the story is utter shit and it features some of the worst writing I have ever seen in any anime.<br />
1/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
The chararters in Eromanga Sensei aren&#039;t chararters<br />
They are just a bunch cringe-worthy archetypes who have no character development and have no unique personally whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Sagiri is just your bottom of the barrel siscon/lolion character who does cute things as well as being a shitty tsundere who refuses to leave her room and does weird shit.<br />
Masamune or generic main protagonist #883 who has a creepy obsession with his sister. People may despise Kyouske for being a retarded siscon freak in Oreimo 2 along with that horrific Oreimo 2 special. Masamune, on the other hand, is on another level. When he&#039;s not screaming like a marron he&#039;s always ranting how beautiful his 13-year-old sister. &quot;Am not even joking when I say that&quot;<br />
The rest of the characters such as Elf Megumi and Muramasa are complete garbage and they are not even mentioning at all. They just exist for cringe-worthy dialogue and meme-service for the Meme community for many social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc.<br />
Hell one of the female supporting characters in this show has dialogue that was written by a horny 12-year-old.<br />
There is a girl in the anime where almost all of her dialogue is base around loving peoples dicks.<br />
Am not even joking when I say that. That&#039;s literally her fucking character trait in this fucking show.<br />
Overall the characters are downright awful with no redeeming values whatsoever.<br />
1/10<br />
<br />
Visuals. <br />
Visually Eromanga Sensei looks nice.<br />
The characters designs are good for what they are as you expect from a moe show, alright background scene recently and the overall animation is fairly standard. However, there is one thing about Eromanga Sensei that I utterly hate that literally destroys everything.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s the camera positioning as well as the camera angles.<br />
The camerawork and the overall camera direction is just fucking horrendous.<br />
Eromanga Sensei has a lot of unnecessary camera placement for fan-service that is both creepy and stupid. It makes the viewer feel uncomfortable as the anime like to show likes to show a freaking 13-year-old doing sexual things.<br />
<br />
There are so much unnecessary camera shots that honestly makes the viewer sick and uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Some of the pointless shots include.<br />
A close-up ass shot of Elf naked playing the piano. (Episode 3)<br />
An extreme close-up shot of Megumi panties where the label itself even had Japanese text (Episode 6)<br />
A panty shot of Sagirl from the first 8 seconds of Episode 11. (Am not even fucking joking)<br />
A close-up shot of Sagirl legs in a compromising position. (Episode 11)<br />
A close-up shot of Sagirl getting changed from her jumpers for 20 seconds in episode 5.<br />
There are still more pointless shots that I missed but I decided to mention these ones as they offended me because not only shot like these wasted time but they also made feel disgusted when every time these shots appear in an episode.<br />
Hell, the show at times doesn&#039;t know how to use The Rule Of Thirds correctly.<br />
<br />
In short, the visuals are decent but it gets ruined by awful camera positioning filled with underage girls and pointless fan-service.<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack for Eromanga Sensei is generic.<br />
The opening and ending themes are cute and quite catchy for what they are but they are nothing special.<br />
Voice acting is standard as you expect. what more needs to be said really.<br />
In short, the soundtrack, the opening/ending themes, and voice acting is pretty average.<br />
<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
Eromanga Sensei is an insult in every sense of the word.<br />
it&#039;s an insult to anime fans.<br />
it&#039;s an insult to Japanese Illustrators.<br />
It&#039;s an insult to women and its an insult to siblings who are portrayed in this anime as nothing but stalkers and idiots who do incest stuff on screen for no reason.<br />
<br />
The story is utter shit that is filled with some of the worst writing and dialogue I have ever seen in any anime. The characters are horrendous archetypes who are annoying and very poorly written from start to finish.<br />
The visuals are average that ruined by horrific camera angles and camera work that has no point other than to show underage girls in sexual positions and the soundtrack is generic.<br />
I don&#039;t recommend this show to anyone whatsoever and you&#039;re better off watching Bakuman or go watch Oreimo Season 1 instead of this pile of waste.<br />
This show represents everything wrong with modern anime and because and I will forever loathe this show with a burning passion.<br />
This show is nothing but jailbait material.<br />
If you liked or enjoyed Eromanga Sensei then good for you but for me, screw this shit!!!<br />
If I have to see Sagirl in a compromising position again am really going to lose it.<br />
<br />
Final Score 1.5/10

    Best show i have ever seen.  First of all I was struck by the beauty of the characters.  In the modern world, so much emphasis is put on the beauty of adult women and their assets aree oversexualized. <br />
 So when in the first 5 minutes of the anime it was clear that the main love interest was a 6 (i mean 6000 year old loli) year old, it was a refreshing change.  Not only do they explore the imouto loving trope which is overlooked by most other animes out there, but they also managed to combine the internship arc with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302828">
        beach episode.  I have never seen a more beautifully woven story with such deep plot and character development.  Furthermore, this show gave me the chills as every scene left me wondering if the FBI was going to show up at my door that very instant.  Thank god they are all 18+.

Oh no. Oh no...<br />
<br />
I was holding off on publishing a review until I finished watching. Not for any hope that something like this would get better, but simply due to the fact that I couldn&#039;t bring myself to write about whatever this is. Eromanga-sensei is everything wrong with the anime industry. And you know what? That&#039;s not funny. I see so many jokes about that concept. How viewers laughingly remark about this series&#039; and how horrible it is but eat it up regardless, promoting this utter shit until it becomes the most popular non-sequel of the season.<br />
<br />
And it is. Eromanga Sensei is the most popular

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250890">
        non-sequel in Japan. Can you believe it? A show about a fourteen year old trying to fuck his twelve year old sister while she molests other twelve year old girls is the most popular program in Japan. It is probably the most popular program amongst western anime fans too. It baffles me. Coming from a western background, series like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad steal that limelight. Sure we have duds like The Walking Dead drifting about with their cable appeal, but even that is understandable to me. At least that has elements of redeemable quality.<br />
<br />
Eromanga has none of that. Eromanga is the mutated lovechild of everything that&#039;s hate-able about this industry and the sole reason why anime series&#039; won&#039;t ever be taken seriously. For every angered fan of anime that realizes that their favorite show or non-ghibli film will never see the light of day in any extended theater run or any major awards show; this is why. Eromanga Sensei is hopefully the worst series I&#039;ll watch to completion. That&#039;s because as a viewer I&#039;ve mostly stuck with some of the most popular anime. I&#039;ve made my way through the highly-touted projects and ignored the seasonal popularity. Well, this is my first time delving deep into it and it yields an unforgettable, but totally forgettable product that fails at even the most basic storytelling. <br />
<br />
This will have spoilers. If you are reading this and haven&#039;t seen the show, good. Don&#039;t watch it. It isn&#039;t worth it. It&#039;s not funny, or engaging, and the memes you have seen about it don&#039;t give a holistic representation of the insane tedium which this show revels in. This show isn&#039;t &quot;so bad it&#039;s good.&quot; Far from it. <br />
<br />
Eromanga-Sensei is just fucking garbage. <br />
<br />

[A Dancing Girl and a Pedophile] <br />
<br />
<br />
This series follows a harem protagonist on a mission to fuck with a plethora of forgettable girl archetypes that you&#039;ve seen a million times in a million different anime. The girl that he will end up being with is Sagiri, his twelve year old NEET sister who has not left her room in years. He also happens to write shitty light novels, much like the ones this series is based on, and his artist just so happens to be the twelve year old non-blood related sister living upstairs. What a coincidence! And of course he finds out and helps her hide her identity. <br />
<br />
Then we meet a few other girls who are also light novel writers and play no role other than to create fanservice scenes that aren&#039;t just of the main girl. Honestly, the first ten episodes of this series really don&#039;t matter. The eleventh episode provides some much needed backstory which just renders the rest of the series up until that point completely useless. Anyway, Eromanga is just a series of empty husks waddling around on screen. It is a collection of sexual gifs that patrol the internet. From the totally inexplicable character writing to the horrendously boring direction to the non-story that is told throughout this series, Eromanga struggles to get anything right. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Visuals]<br />
<br />
<br />
The visuals are probably the most positive aspect in this series, and even they are incredibly uneven. You see, A-1 hired a unique key animator for Sagiri, the little sister, and only Sagiri. So her animation is often much more fluid than the rest of the characters. This creates an animated whiplash of epic proportions. You go from a well-animated movement to a seizure-like stutter within the same scene. So even if her animation is good, this show has a tendency to skimp out on everything else. <br />
<br />
Some highlights are absurdly off-model characters that kind of look hilarious. Really egregious oversights, even in the shows forgettable OP. A-1, like they do, put the minimal effort required into making this show palatable to look at while forgetting to actually give it direction. It looks like any generic as all hell sitcom. Bad. <br />
<br />
Every episode is mostly just a compilation of characters sitting around talking exposition for minutes on end before they get to the two minutes of fanservice that peppers the internet for the next few days. They virtually just include the last eighteen minutes for no discernible reason. This could&#039;ve been just two minutes of soft-core porn and I think the fans would have been just as happy, if not more so, with this series. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Sound]<br />
<br />
<br />
It&#039;s bad. The OP is forgettable but not painful, the ED I already forgot. The show has a seasoned atrociousness, as it&#039;s unfunny and bland writing is often back-ended by painful background music. Now this ranges from &quot;fat guy walking&quot; tuba to &quot;Squidward playing the clarinet&quot; and it was initially funny that this series had such abrasive background music. But it got tedious really quick and ended up just making me angry by episode four. <br />
<br />
What can I say. This show sounds horrible.<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />

<br />
[Characters/Story]<br />
<br />
<br />
Now lets get to the meat. And by meat, I mean the meat of a bunch of underage girls that are endlessly used as tools to turn on a bunch of creepy fucking virgins watching this series to get off. I get it, it&#039;s okay to imagine children naked if they are fake. And i&#039;m a supporter of the notion that thought-crime shouldn&#039;t be illegal because it doesn&#039;t harm anyone. I don&#039;t honestly care what you think about on your free-time and I care even less if it is totally fictitious and not exploiting anything.<br />
<br />
So my problems with this series isn&#039;t that it sexualizes kids. That&#039;s nothing new in anime (as disturbing as that is) and it is far from its biggest fault. It&#039;s pedophilic and gross, and I often felt ornery watching this series due to the kind of framing devices it used to express its sexuality. For example, instead of diagetically forcing fanservice on us, the director made the &#039;brave&#039; choice of literally just having shots of characters from below. It felt like a pedophiles hidden camera every time a character was talking. <br />
<br />
Whether the show is being serious and dramatic or light-hearted and unfunny, the fanservice never ends. Character is being cute? Show them being cute with a below-the-skirt shot. Character crying? Have it framed so their still developing tits take up half the shot. It&#039;s cringe. It is a repulsive way to shoehorn this nonsense into your show. But on the other hand, this is the only thing this show has going for it anyway. It is riddled with plot-holes and totally clueless characters that defy any logic whatsoever. <br />
<br />
In one scene it is established that Sagiri cannot draw girls with big tits. Why? Because she uses herself as a model for all her drawings and she is twelve. So her brother, being the great, enabling guy he is, tells her to look up idols on google to discover how to draw big tits. It works! She can now draw big meatsacks. However, two episodes later she regresses back to not being able to draw titties because... a girl showed her, her panties on skype. Let me get this straight, seeing panties made you unable to draw tits. <br />
<br />
But it gets better. <br />
<br />
The way she says she can resolve this issue is if her brother literally lures girls into her room and has them show her their panties. Not only is that fucking creepy, but more importantly, how does drawing panties even relate to drawing tits? Why are glaring issues like this not resolved in the initial adaptation phase?! <br />
<br />
This would be fine. Well, no it actually wouldn&#039;t, but not as bad if it didn&#039;t lead to one of the most genuinely disturbing scenes i&#039;ve seen in anime. Now i&#039;m not one to be disturbed, although I am definitely one to cringe. But her brother does it. He finds a girl and drags her to her room, ties her up and blindfolds her and has Sagiri draw her panties. But get this, Sagiri, the twelve year old girl, rips that other twelve year old&#039;s panties off. She literally molests another girl. And it isn&#039;t really played as anything either, that girl is genuinely uncomfortable and so was I. Get this. They become great friends afterwards too. Talk about Stockholm syndrome. <br />
<br />
I wish this was the only ridiculous inanity that occurs, but it isn&#039;t. A character called Elf exists. She has pointy elf-ears for literally no reason. It is never explained or mentioned. She just does. Her characterization is as confusing as she is repulsive. Very much so. She shifts between big-sister-esq and comforting to childish and annoying to a complete tsundere from episode to episode and it makes virtually no sense. She is also a part of our protagonist&#039;s harem.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to the third character. Muramasa. Who&#039;s probably the most well-designed of the bunch, but has the personality of a grapefruit.  She&#039;s a best selling light-novel author yet it is revealed that she was inspired by our harem protagonist&#039;s work ever since she was young. Well, younger. This was an element I guessed the second I saw the character simply because you can&#039;t have a character in a harem that is better than the male protagonist. You just can&#039;t. This is a power fantasy series for lonely kids and adults that want young girls to flock all over them in their dreams. So you can&#039;t have them be worse at anything. You need them to be virtually perfect. And our protagonist is.<br />
<br />
These days, i&#039;m developing a blase attitude towards the inherent sexism showed in anime. Which is a bit sad because I do love me a strong female character who &quot;don&#039;t need no man&quot;. But you know, when the entire medium is marketed towards teenage boys it kind of makes sense to have every male be the best and every women be a toy to be played with. Even if it is obnoxious and kind of distressing.<br />
<br />
This show is obviously not any different. In one titular scene we have our protagonist chat with the big brother of Elf, and when he discusses the great things about Elf the only thing he can say is, &quot;She&#039;s nice and is a good cook.&quot; Wow. What a charmer. And this isn&#039;t even played off as a joke, this was a genuine scene with sappy, saccharine music in the background. <br />
<br />
This kind of character writing extends throughout the series, too. The character writing is so bad that it feels like our protagonist is maliciously playing with these girls, since he&#039;s shown to be so oblivious that it becomes hard to believe. He rejects a girl, but obviously she keeps pursuing him, but then he proceeds to invite her to plenty of social events, as if it won&#039;t be awkward as all hell for her. It truly is a baffling kind of attitude. <br />
<br />
I get the excuse, too, that he&#039;s just a &quot;stupid teenager&quot;, and he is. But you know what? Using character stupidity as a plot contrivance isn&#039;t good writing. It doesn&#039;t make the protagonist or the story any better knowing this dude might actually be handicapped. It just makes it even more frustrating. <br />
<br />
We are getting front row seats to this idiot fucking with these girls. And it isn&#039;t funny. Whether he understands that he is doing this or not, it&#039;s happening, and it is the least funny thing in a show that is already aggressively unfunny. If it was well-written comedy then it could be played as dark humor, but it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s just a bunch of girls yelling &quot;baka!&quot; really loudly. <br />
<br />
To refer back to that scene of our protagonist talking with Elf&#039;s brother, who by the way asked him to marry her in that very scene. Get this, marrying a fourteen year old. He says that he would if he wasn&#039;t in love with someone else, referring to his twelve year old sister. However, the episode before he actually told the sister he would be with Muramasa if he wasn&#039;t in love with &#039;someone&#039;, as he puts it, since he&#039;s unable to admit his love of his sister, sometimes. So this entire scene played as a total contradiction, unless the protagonist was supposed to be a total lying scumbag fuck. I don&#039;t think that was intended, though. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
When it comes to script writing this show is a masterpiece. Much like a Michael Bay script, Eromanga has a tendency to describe everything that is shown. I&#039;m not talking about emotions, i&#039;m talking about literally shown. In one scene they are goofing off instead of working, and when the brother of Elf walks in to catch them in the act of goofing off, Elf stands up and literally explains what he is seeing. It is this baffling mixture of having to exposit a moment and also badly adapting dialogue from the light novel. <br />
<br />
You are seeing everything she is saying. It isn&#039;t even the whole &quot;show don&#039;t tell&quot; rule, that doesn&#039;t apply. That&#039;s a criticism for bad writing. This isn&#039;t bad writing. This is like the a new universe of writing. It is so abysmal that it bore it&#039;s way out of the crust of her earth and floated off into space. This kind of writing extends to multiple different episodes too, often times characters restate their purpose multiple times and it still leads to nothing. For example, the entirety of episode ten was about how Muramasa loves the protagonist, but that&#039;s been established since her second introductory episode. She literally just reuses the dialogue she used that episode. It is a special kind of absurd.<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
[Speed Round : This show is shit!]<br />
<br />
<br />
* After a one-episode tournament-esq arc finishes, there is an after party to which everyone who participated in the competition established gets to come. Elf ends up going, even though she wasn&#039;t in the competition and this wasn&#039;t addressed at all. It was just an excuse to bring all the girls together. <br />
<br />
* Everything ties back to the MC for virtually no reason but to make him the focal point of every characters lives. Every character backstory has something to do with our main character and it might be the most contrived bullshit I&#039;ve ever witnessed on screen. And I watched the entirety of SAO. <br />
<br />
* The backgrounds lack any detail whatsoever. We are in a character&#039;s room but their room doesn&#039;t have any personal mementos or knickknacks. In fact, the only room that has detail is Sagiri&#039;s, but she&#039;s a NEET with the cleanest room I&#039;ve ever seen. <br />
<br />
* To piggy-back off that. She&#039;s a NEET hikikomori, stating she hasn&#039;t left her room in years. Yet her room is perfectly clean. There is also no bathroom in her room. How does this even work? Does she shit out of the window? This entire show plays this seriously negative affliction as totally okay. <br />
<br />
* Uninspired character designs. The parents of our two protagonists are virtually just the same characters but aged up. It is lazy as all hell. <br />
<br />
* This show lacks any timing whatsoever. Not only for it&#039;s comedic punchlines, but for its fanservice as well. Fanservice can strike at any time and it is distracting and undercuts any potential catharsis this show is trying to establish. <br />
<br />
* Episode eleven changes the entire story of the series and renders the past ten episodes totally irrelevant to where the conclusion is heading. <br />
<br />
* The finale was completely and utterly pointless, playing more like an OVA than a finale. It was nothing. Much like the rest of this series. <br />
<br />
* Girls get embarrassed for virtually no reason. As in, in one scene our protagonist is getting hit on by Elf on the beach as she asks him to spread some sunscreen on her back. Then once he repeats her orders she gets embarrassed about it. Why? Why is girls being embarrassed about inane shit such a cliche in anime? <br />
<br />
* In one episode of the series Sagiri makes Elf and Muramasa her models so she can draw them in revealing positions. Yet, to describe the positions, she draws them. So they are models she already had drawn... so why did she even need them to model in the first place? It made no fucking sense. <br />
<br />
* Muramasa was often played as the really &quot;cute&quot; one, as in, the characters acknowledged how pretty she was. However, since she has the same kind of body-type as any other girl, apart from bigger tits, it wasn&#039;t convincing at all. The usual anime presentation of &quot;same-body, different standards&quot; that makes no sense. <br />
<br />
* If you&#039;ve noticed I haven&#039;t actually said what our protagonist&#039;s name is, and that&#039;s because it doesn&#039;t matter. <br />
<br />
* Every girl is a fucking slut. <br />
<br />

[The state of anime]<br />
<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe with this show isn&#039;t that it is bad. Well, it is, it&#039;s abhorrent in every way. But the biggest problem, and perhaps the most upsetting issue, is that it is so incredibly popular. It is, undoubtedly, in the mainstream. A show like Eromanga is the mainstream in anime. That is so fucking confusing to me. I tried to explain this earlier but the people who genuinely love this show seem incredibly insecure about their love for it. <br />
<br />
They explained to me that I&#039;m simply being bias and that I&#039;m &quot;trying&quot; to hate this show. When that isn&#039;t true at all. I actually discovered this show through a meme, which is ironically why it is popular in the first place, because it&#039;s made to be a  meme, and I thought the meme was kind of hilarious and I decided to watch the series. Sure, once I realized it is awful I went into every episode expecting nothing but terrible nonsense, but that&#039;s logical. You shouldn&#039;t go into a snake pit, get bitten, and then go into a snake pit again expecting not to get bitten. Maybe i&#039;m just a masochist, but I feel like I needed to finish this series simply to experience the most awful possible thing.<br />
<br />
However, to many people from what I&#039;ve seen, this is far from the most awful possible thing. I was constantly told that this is just a &quot;mediocre&quot; show. That i&#039;m over-exaggerating it&#039;s awfulness. To that I say, if this is mediocrity to you, then you might have the most incredibly low standard for television. If this is &quot;mediocre&quot; for anime, then anime fucking sucks. If this is &quot;mediocre&quot; for anything, then that anything is the worst.<br />
<br />
It is paramount we criticize it too. Supporting a product like this will help fuel more products like this. In 2014,  Miyazaki said something incredibly poignant about anime as an industry, and the fans, instead of taking it seriously, decided to take it as a joke. He made it clear that as an industry, anime is spiraling out into nothingness. There is an endless loop of self-inspiration that will never actually prompt original or groundbreaking content. <br />
<br />
As an industry, anime is otaku driven, and as a people, according to Miyazaki, otaku&#039;s aren&#039;t usually capable of understanding how people work. And if you are writing characters to represent people and don&#039;t understand how people work, your characters will take roles that are wholly unrealistic. We already see this in anime constantly. Completely stupid character archetypes that simply don&#039;t exist in the real world, from Tsunderes to the concept of a pure, yet sexual girls that seems to inhabit essentially every anime with inherent, childish sexuality in it. <br />
<br />
So when these totally unaware shows become popular and are roots for inspiration, they spawn more shows like them. Much like SAO did, much like Re:Zero is doing, much like Eromanga sensei will do, and it is a constant loop of something getting worse and worse. It&#039;s not funny. It isn&#039;t worth joking about. It genuinely makes this industry look awful. I care because I love animation, and while anime and I have mixed feelings about each other, I can&#039;t help but support animation as a medium and I want to see it succeed and be utilized to its full potential. But as it stands, anime is hardly scratching the surface and it will continue to scratch less and less as this loop of uncreativity continues. Which is deeply saddening. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Conclusion and Criticism]<br />
<br />
<br />
Criticizing something is important. Critics help spur movements and change notions and promote something of quality. Look no further than the French New Wave, the most influential movement in film history which was spawned in the palms of upset critics that wanted to change the status quo. This movement permeated throughout the world and ended up inspiring the greatest films and directors in of all time. Without the French New Wave, some of the greatest anime wouldn&#039;t even exist. Satoshi Kon wouldn&#039;t have edited like he did. Monogatari wouldn&#039;t have its signature style. At its base, this starts with a criticism. Bringing attention to something. It is incredibly important to fight for the kind of television you want to see. <br />
<br />
I get it, though, not everyone wants this in their television. Some viewers just want to see cute girls prance around on screen saying random shit and yelling &quot;baka!&quot; loudly. I get it. Some people don&#039;t care about a narrative, or characters, or even visuals half the time. This show being popular makes that clear. However, on behalf of everyone that does care. That does want television, specifically anime to push itself further away from the stigma regarding the quality of the medium, I ask you to perhaps watch a series with cute girls but in a narrative that actually exists. Characters that are actually there. And there are plenty of shows like that, too. You don&#039;t have to settle for something like Eromanga-Sensei.<br />
<br />
Kyoto Animation specializes in cute girls but with engaging characters, exceptional directing, and spectacular visuals. If you are looking for porn, look up porn. If you want to watch a series, make the sacrifice of watching something that at least has an element of positivity past sexualizing its objects. This&#039;ll promote series that will actually create maybe something a bit more interesting and original. <br />
<br />
Eromanga-Sensei is genuinely a saddening experience. It is so incredibly bad in just about every way, yet people really love it. It is so popular that it will spawn plenty of sequels and shows copying its already cliche formula that it truly makes me upset. An industry that is already a mecca for unoriginal concepts that virtually just copy one another will just continue to be an industry of looping inspiration and nothing to break up the tedious formula.<br />
<br />
Eromanga-sensei is truly the worst.

    The show ups the boundaries for what a bad show means and thus is worth the highest of marks. It can and shall break all your expectations on what a bad show is. Where it constantly gets worse episode after episode by 1- upping itself using all the cliches and fetishes in existence but sticking true to incest. It is slow but for a person who likes slow shows they won&#039;t have a problem.<br />
THE STORY<br />
is crap<br />
.....<br />
i should explain, shouldnt I, basically its a carbon copy of the writers old work oreimo but now step(you can see where this story will go) guess what it does.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249983">
        it has also elements of harem(sao style, rejected womens club). <br />
Music <br />
best part of the show is the op by far, now that is sad cause it is at best average to good plus the dances make me die a little bit inside<br />
THE ART<br />
is moe as all hell and thus suits the show completely. It is thus simpler to draw and less mistakes are done except for the op&#039;s end with the macaroni leg sagiri.<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
all anime tropes<br />
girl next door<br />
chuni<br />
imouto sister<br />
serious kimono wearing girl<br />
no parents to be seen<br />
all cliche as hell<br />
The most original thing about this show is sagiris hair <br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
8/8 GR8 B8 M8 no joke this is the first time i ever use that old meme but it works so well in this, <br />
jailbait check<br />
clickbait check<br />
but it works so well<br />
I have learned two things from this show ,anime is trash and the white haired girl always gets the boy.<br />
Overall i enjoyed cringing laughing and even found myself waiting for the next episode to know what new trash will be created. <br />
Now that the show finished i can say this show helped me explore myself both mentally and physically at times, making me understand that this show truly is the best trash i have ever watched

    Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past century, it’s no secret how perverse the Japanese culture can be sometimes, mainly in the medium of anime. Writers and producers litter their animations with heavily endowed females, ecchi harems bordering on hentai and lewd jokes about a ten-year-old’s panties. Anime like High School DXD and Masou Gakuen HXH continue to push the boundary of what is acceptable to show to its viewers, and I’ve been partly responsible at times myself of indulging in this trashy, sexual fanservice. However, with A-1 Studio’s 2017 release of Eromanga Sensei, I’ve officially hit a tipping point in my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255047">
        opinions of what is right and wrong. The series exhausts every effort to forcefully suggest an “incestuous” relationship between a teenager and his stepsister. What results is one of the most disgusting, tasteless works of fiction ever produced. It&#039;s a show that’s harrowing to my own morality, and whose influence could degrade the already thinning strand of legitimacy the anime industry has left. <br />
<br />
As soon as Eromanga Sensei begins, evidence of the writer’s true intentions come to light. Masamune, our main protagonist, lives with his mother, and Sagiri, the blushing lolli, lives with her father. Magically the pair’s parents become romantically involved and eventually make the decision to live together. Thus, their dramatic introduction begins, leading to the intended incest theme. Sagiri appears from behind her father’s back, timid and radiating with a brilliant light of angelic proportions. Masamune locks eyes with her and is immediately overcome with romantic intentions. It’s naturally what every 13 year old does when meeting their preteen stepsister for the first time...amirite? Apparently the manga’s writer Tsukasa Fushimi had a previous work in which he tried to force the ACTUAL brother and sister to be in a relationship, only to have the idea not get greenlighted for obvious ethical reasons. Hell, I guess even some of Japan has a moral conscience.<br />
<br />
Fast-forward a few years to the devastating yet convenient turn of events in which the two parents perish in an undetailed car accident and Masamune and Sagiri are forced to live with each other. Naturally Sagiri locks herself in her room, forcing her “brother” to answer to her every beck and call. Masamune is an aspiring manga author who works with an anonymous erotic manga artist in hopes of someday hitting it big in the industry. However, while anxiously viewing one of his masked partner’s live streams, Masamune accidentally discovers that Eromanga-Sensei’s true identity is that of his own sister Sagiri...<br />
<br />
THE PLOT THICKENS.<br />
<br />
The rest of the anime is rather generic from a plot perspective. Sagiri and Masamune are secretly attracted to each other, however neither of them admit their infatuation due to a plethora of awkward misunderstandings. More female characters enter the fray, further clouding Masamune’s perception of love, and at the end of it all we as viewers are left with nothing more than a shell of a stereotypical romantic comedy. There’s just one catch. It isn’t the overall plot structure that bothers me about Eromanga Sensei. It isn’t the apparent reality that every teenager in Japan is a manga author. It isn’t even the vanilla or recycled characters omnipresent in seemingly every facet of the series. What incessantly infuriates me about this anime is the shameless amount of forced sexual topics and fanservice shoved down my throat around every turn. I’m not by any stretch of the imagination an ecchi fan, but at least most of them have the decency to shy away from the taboo of lolita porn. Scattered shots of some rather private scenes involving Sagiri or other pre-teen girls, either blatant or subtle leave a disgusting taste in my mouth. Added to this are countless suggestive panty shots, only fueling the stigma many already possess related to the anime industry. Not to mention the mention the random expletive from a twelve year old about liking penises. Is the industry even trying anymore?<br />
<br />
All of the fanservice aside, the aspect of Eromanga Sensei I found most unnerving is the suggested incestuous relationship between Masamune and Sagiri. Countless anime before it have alluded to or even explored the romantic sibling complex (Koi Kaze, OreImo, No Game No Life), but Fushimi’s methods in Eromanga are so sloppy and pathetic it’s embarrassing. There is no “relationship” between the two main characters. It’s as if they are actors dropped into an improv scene with pre-assigned roles. “Oh, this is when I’m supposed to blush when he says something!” or “Oh, I better internal monologue about my sister now”. It all reeks of contrivance and agenda. At least OreImo seemed more realistic in its relationship development. And when are we going to draw the line with what is acceptable to release in an anime? Shock value scenes with large breasts and convenient erotic shots are desensitizing and generally understood to be exaggeratory. However, showcasing more personal themes like incest to such an impressional target audience can actually have long-lasting effects with their ability to discern what is moral and acceptable.<br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT- It’s not normal to want to have sex with your brother or sister. <br />
<br />
I digress.<br />
<br />
Fushimi’s creation of Masamune was flawed in how he appears to just “exist” without really creating much opportunity for relatability. The feelings for his sister are never really internalized or matured, but instead seem to exist from the moment he meets her. For the rest of the anime, viewers are now transfixed on what taboo thought or emotion Masamune will have for Sagiri and couldn’t care less about him as a person. His manga author career serves as nothing more than a vessel to exploit his relationship and complicate things as more loli’s are introduced. It’s cringeworthy characterization at best. In essence, Masamune is just a plot device for the underlying themes of the show. Well done sir, you created one of the most boring characters in anime history.<br />
<br />
Sagiri is the most forgivable character in Eromanga Sensei. She’s young, so in a way, she has an excuse for acting the way she does in terms of isolationism when her father passes away. Her interpretation of what an acceptable relationship is could also be skewed due to her young age, which is why she has strange feelings for her brother. Unfortunately, this does far less than make her an interesting character. At times, she can be really frustrating because of how irrational her behavior can be and it doesn’t help her build a strong likability case. Elf is cute, annoying, and is the tsundere trope in a nutshell. Another plot device with pre-installed emotions and perogatives. The rest of the cast does far from marvel, consisting of a gaggle of uninspired and forgettable personalities. Character development does little to nothing in justifying the existence of such a tasteless anime.<br />
<br />
Animation wise, Eromanga is what you would expect from an anime in 2017. Flashy, bright hues accompany each scene, with a plethora of cutesy blushing character models to boot. Each character was constructed with individuality in mind, so their appearance is unique and eye-catching. It’s a shame more couldn’t have been done in the art department to overshadow the supreme lack of depth in the characters themselves. And as attractive as the models looked, it wasn’t enough to salvage the eventual trainwreck bestowed upon them by Fushimi’s writing.<br />
<br />
The music in Eromanga Sensei was playful and fun, ad nauseum. Whether it was the seemingly innocent and bubbly OP, or the adorable ED sequence of Sagiri dancing in front of a laundry machine, the cute factor was never dialed down from 11. The rest of the OST fit in well with the scenes as much as I hate to say it, I really can’t fault the sound designers here. Voice acting was also believable and well cast.<br />
<br />
As I descend from my soapbox, I’ll leave you with this. Eromanga Sensei is not a “quality” anime. It may be disguised with endearing female characters and a relationship portrayed as innocent or normal, but when you brush off the surface you’ll find nothing more than a lewd and often inappropriately centered series. I wouldn’t even recommend it to someone that I know would like it, because at some point the spread of immoral content has to stop. Fans of shows like this are what gives the anime industry a negative light in mainstream media. Maybe when we start to take the medium serious and stop promoting crap like this, more skilled writers and producers will be drawn to it. Honestly, I’m embarrassed as an anime fan that a show like Eromanga Sensei even exists. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other reviews!<br />

    Introduction:<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know I&#039;m WAY late to this party. A friend requested a review though, so why not? Eromanga Sensei made quite the splash online as THE bad anime of 2017. Gigguk hyped it up famously as &quot;The perfect bad anime&quot; and &quot;The ULTIMATE bad anime&quot;. He made it seem like it&#039;s so bad it&#039;s amazing and hysterical. Sadly, I must disagree. Eromanga Sensei is NOT &quot;The Room&quot; of anime. It isn&#039;t uniquely bad or uniquely depraved. It&#039;s just an amalgamation of the shittiest cliches and tropes from other bad echii anime. <br />
<br />
Background:<br />
<br />
Art in general is highly subjective, but what qualifies as &quot;So bad it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281059">
        good&quot; is especially fuzzy. For me personally, the best examples either display extreme technical incompetence where the creators clearly didn’t know what they are doing, or batshit insane projects that beat all the odds by somehow getting made in the first place. Let&#039;s look at a classic bad movie with Dolemite. I’ve never seen a film where the director gave less of a fuck. The lead actor flubs a line? Who cares! Keep shooting. The sound equipment AND crew are visible? Who cares! An actor wasn’t ready and has to run to his cue at the start of a scene? Doesn’t matter. Every fight scene is our overweight protagonist awkwardly lifting his leg in the rough proximity of the bad guys and them hurling themselves backwards. The writing is astonishingly bad throughout. On a purely technical level, Dolemite makes The Room look like Citizen Kane. It’s that perfect type of mesmerizingly bad where it’s impossible to tell what was intentionally funny and what was honest incompetence. <br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s look at some underdog stories that beat the odds just by getting made. Look at every movie made by Troma entertainment. Lloyd Kaufman graduated from Yale and had the intelligence and the right friends (including Oliver Stone) to be a major Hollywood director. However, he hated that movies were greenlit or denied by a board of executives based on how well they were projected to sell. Kaufman rebelled and founded a studio based entirely around producing the ludicrous shit that would NEVER get greenlit elsewhere. Most of these movies were indeed horrible like “They Call me Macho Woman” and “Surf Nazis Must Die”, but Kaufman’s middle finger to Hollywood gave him cult status as a kind of anti-hero. It’s thanks to people like Kaufman that we get rare indy gems like “Six Stringed Samurai”. That’s a movie about a katana wielding Buddy Holly! He’s on a quest to find the last American city after a nuclear war and claim the throne from Elvis. The soundtrack couldn’t afford to use Buddy Holly or Elvis…so they found some random Russian band called the Red Elvises, who were willing to do the soundtrack for free. The Red Elvises specialize in playing 1960s Surf Rock and Rockabilly using a balalaika instead of a guitar! Six Stringed Samurai is the kind of insane shit that SOMEHOW exists and should be celebrated for that reason alone!<br />
Now let’s get back to Eromanga Sensei. Eromanga is perfectly fine on a technical level and was made by people who although lazy, knew exactly what they were doing. The series knew it had an audience based on the success of Oreimo and sure enough was a decent hit in Japan. It was no mistake that Eromanga got made, rather a cynical decision to milk some cash out of the lolicon otakus. Eromanga in my mind is NOT worth celebrating. <br />
<br />
Story and Characters:<br />
<br />
The story is about a light novel author named Izumi. He’s still in high school, but only cares about being a successful writer in the world of ero LNs. Izumi is extremely hardworking and prolific but is unfortunately a terrible writer. Izumi kind of acts as the avatar of series writer/director, Tsukasa Fushimi. Izumi’s novels only sell as well as they do thanks to his mysterious illustrator, who specializes in drawing lewd imagery. It turns out that this illustrator is Izumi’s obnoxious little step-sister named Sagiri. It ALSO turns out that their next-door neighbor is his arch rival in the world of erotic LNs. Izumi must try rise to the top of the ero LN world while also struggling with feelings of love for his step-sister. Basically, if you’ve seen Oreimo, you’ve seen Eromanga Sensei. If you’ve seen any of the dozens of shitty sibling incest echii, you’ve seen Eromanga sensei. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Eromanga Sensei isn’t funny. It isn’t erotic. It isn’t unique and amusingly bad. It’s just trite, boring, garbage. Well, at least it’s scratching an itch for loli lovers, right? Surely it features the most naked little girls of any anime in recent memory! Nope! Thanks to changes in Japan’s censorship laws over the last few years, there is no full-frontal nudity or unobscured rear-view nudity in the entire series. If you were hoping for something uniquely perverted, this isn’t it. Go watch Aki Sora instead. I have nothing further to say about this pile. It’s just this utterly mediocre echii with no reason to exist that you shouldn’t watch under any circumstances. <br />

    First of all, I do believe you shouldn&#039;t give any show a goddamn 1 from 10 score on review just because it has some tropes that you hate. <br />
<br />
Not to said I&#039;m against someone voicing their opinion, but as we wrote a review here that the others gonna read and probably &#039;Influincing&#039; them to watch or dropped a certain show, we should do our best to be as open-minded as possible. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Everyday we s̶t̶r̶a̶y̶ ̶f̶u̶r̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶g̶o̶d̶&#039;̶s̶ ̶l̶i̶g̶h̶t̶ get closer to jail. <br />
<br />
...JK lol. Long-ass reviews coming right noowww. (I&#039;m not really good at english, tho&#039;, so hopefully you who decided to read this anyway

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247509">
        can understand what I wrote)<br />
<br />
Well, When I first seen the trailer, what I had in thought was &quot;So... Another of that infamous Oreimo? but they&#039;re not blood related? ...It&#039;s like a cue for the author to get wild this time lol. Still can&#039;t watch it, tho&#039;&quot;. <br />
<br />
But damn I was wrong. The show is actually, even tho&#039; it shares the same element with Oreimo, actually differs in theme and feels more light than Oreimo in some sense that even someone who&#039;s pretty much against watching an anime with incest as its main theme like me could actually enjoy. <br />
<br />
Just like one of the reviewer here said, the show introduces us to the otaku community (just like Oreimo), but this time, it&#039;s more specifically about Light Novel. It&#039;s not really a show with generic MC, where the big bro doing everything he can so he will able to bang his imouto (The guy even actually against incestual relationships), it also give us a little hindsight on what LN&#039;s Authors through before he could publish their works.  <br />
<br />
It starts off with The Big Bro, Masamune, who wished he can see his lil&#039; sis face again as after the incident where their parents died, She never going out from her bedroom again. <br />
It shows how dedicated the big bro in still taking care of her sister although just from the other side of the door. <br />
A lot happen and after some &#039;Accident&#039;, they found themselves to be closer than before. <br />
<br />
-Story: 7 <br />
As I said, this kind of story already around since long time ago but it gave us a different theme from what&#039;s been around before (Imho). We really can think of this as OreImo v2, lol, but it really is different from it&#039;s big bro. <br />
<br />
-Art: 9 <br />
Well, it&#039;s another A-1 masterclass. Not really my favorite studio but they really done a good job with the visuals. <br />
<br />
-Sound: 9 <br />
ClariS song will always got 9 or 10 rating in my book lol. <br />
And the OP and ED is kind of adorable, too. <br />
<br />
-Character: 7 <br />
The MC is a generic MC we can found in many anime, but what differs here is his mindset, where he really do love his Lil&#039; sis, but he against the incestual relationships and still try to act as a proper big bro as best as possible (Even tho&#039; they&#039;re not blood-related, but this is &#039;That&#039; kind of show, so it can be expected they will ended up as couple in the end). <br />
And the main love interest too, Sagiri, is FCKING BETTER THAN KIRINO. Like She has that unique voice, ADORABLE LITTLE DANCE IN THE OP AND ED, not a bitch at all, and actually has a respect to his big bro. <br />
The other casts are pretty much really generic, that&#039;s why I give 7 scores in this category. Like, rival that ended up have a feelings for the MC, an easygoing boss, and so on. ...Except that one loli who said She loves &#039;D*ck&#039;. It made me freeze on front of my computer for a few secs lol. It&#039;s the first time I seen this kind of scene not from hentai. <br />
<br />
-Enjoyment: 8 <br />
Had many little giggling throughout the episodes. It&#039;s not the best anime I&#039;ve watched, yeah, but it&#039;s still pretty enjoyable, too. The conversation between the characters weren&#039;t really as bland as what peoples pointing out, especially between Masamune and Sagiri. <br />
<br />
-Overall: 7 <br />
If you enjoy a little lighthearted story, you might give this a chance. but this anime is certainly not for e̶l̶i̶t̶i̶s̶t̶ every audience, so try to watch at least 1 or 2 episodes before you decided to drop the show or not. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s all from me. For you who actually read the review, hope you can understand what I typed. Hope I can see you sons of gun again. <br />
<br />
Next time.

    This is easily the most enjoyable Anime of the season.  So much so that I want to go back and watch all the episodes up to the current one again right now.  First I want to preface this by saying, there is a lot of hate towards this show by really retarded people.  Before I even began watching the show, I knew what I was expecting to see.  The description is very clear, and knowing the mind behind it, if you don&#039;t want to see the new &quot;sibling romantic comedy&quot; then you shouldn&#039;t even begin watching in the first place. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247333">
        In real life, I don&#039;t purposely go looking for things I would hate and put hours of my time, effort, and energy into them.  If you understand that this will be an incest comedy, which it doesn&#039;t even try to hide being, then you will enjoy your experience with this show, if not, just go watch something more to your liking.  <br />
<br />
I really enjoy everything about this show.  I also enjoyed OreImo, but this one is completely different.  I guess it&#039;s because in OreImo there was a feeling that the main character might choose a different girl, and in fact the arc where he dated Kuroneko was one of my favorite parts of that series.  In this show, it seems that all the side characters are firmly supportive of the Masamune/Sagiri ship.  In OreImo, you had some pretty serious competition for the main character, with each of the girls wanting to get a piece of the action.  So unlike the harem aspect of that series, this one is much more of a romance anime.  The characters are all likeable.  The least likeable is Elf, but after learning more about her, you will warm up to her as well.<br />
<br />
Sagiri is one of the most adorable characters you will ever encounter in anime.  She is certainly not equatable to any real life human, so don&#039;t expect  to find anyone in real life that resembles her.  As Masamune comments, Sagiri is more of a fairy like, almost ethereal character.  On one hand she is so innocent, yet on the other, she is a complete pervert.  But one thing is for sure, if I were to ever have a little sister, I would want her to be just like Sagiri.  Tempermental, but not so ridiculously cartoonishly tsundere.  You can really feel the genuine love she has, even if she can&#039;t really express it properly.<br />
<br />
The main character, although clearly a siscon, also has the restraint to not want to pursue those feelings.  There is a morality that keeps him in check.  Yet being able to pour those feelings into his &quot;love letter&quot; of a story which apparently is so genuine that it would bring a reader to tears, it is a sweet thing to see the closeness developing between brother and sister who are destined to be together.  If this series were to end with them not being together in some way, shape, or form it would be a complete travesty.  <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think that there is anything wrong with non blood related &quot;family members&quot; having a relationship in real life.  Love is a strange thing and it&#039;s not two people&#039;s fault that their parents ended up in a relationship.  That happening should not make them having romantic feelings for one another something to be ashamed of.  Obviously two blood related family members should not pursue a relationship in real life.  However, despite my wanting Kuroneko to prevail in OreImo, I was still 100% behind Kirino being with her brother once she finally admitted her feelings.  <br />
<br />
Once again, if you aren&#039;t going to flip your script over the &quot;sibling romance&quot;, then you will love this show.  Very cute girls, great comedy, and overall a wonderful experience which will make you fall in love if you&#039;ll let it.  If you know you can&#039;t get past the premise of the show, don&#039;t willingly slit your wrists and cry to us while bleeding.  It just shows that you are childish and only care about people listening to you complain.  I hate country music, so, knowing that a music festival will feature all country music, you wouldn&#039;t catch me dead there... the same rule applies here.  Watch it if you are open minded and you will not regret it, it will no doubt become one of your favorites from this year.<br />
<br />
PS As a side note, the top commenter who tries to trash this Anime is incorrect in saying that Sagiri is 10, because she is in fact 13.  I&#039;m not sure if that is her age in the Light Novel or not, but considering this is a discussion of the anime in which she is 13, their point is invalid about claiming that the sexualization of her character is promoting pedophilia. Whether you agree with it or not, 13 is the legal age of consent in Japan.  This may seem &quot;horrible&quot; to some people, but even in parts of the US a person can get married as young as age 12.  If you don&#039;t believe me, feel free to look up the legal marriage ages across the US yourself.  Without parental consent a girl can marry at age 15 in Mississippi.  With parental consent, a girl can get married at age 13 in New Hampshire and 12 in Massachusetts.  Even more interesting is that there is no restriction on age of marriage in Mississippi as long as there is parental consent.

    I&#039;d like to start out by saying that I tried to read and respect the other users of this site&#039;s opinions, but it seems that everyone decided to watch one episode and call it garbage, or didn&#039;t even try to look past the lewded characters at all. It&#039;s sad that the number one most helpful review was someone trashing it because why not. People who gave it tens might have been over exaggerating, but giving it a one isn&#039;t fair to the show. The show does have lewded characters, but don&#039;t all animes have some sort of fan service? I don&#039;t understand how you could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249763">
        rate it this harshly without realizing this fact. This may sound stupid, but the plot isn&#039;t always what decides whether an anime is great or not. It surely is a great contributing factor, but there are other things that make an anime fun to watch. First of all, I&#039;d like to commend the great soundtrack of this show. I always sit and listen during the opening and ending, which I can&#039;t say I do for every show. To me, good ops and eds can make a show much better, being the hype in the beginning and the satisfying, familiar song at the end. The art is also amazing, and very appealing to the eyes. I will say that the shows plot isn&#039;t A+, but it&#039;s a rom-com, guys. The story is about the main character and the girls who surround him. It isn&#039;t meant to be full of action and adventure, it&#039;s meant to make you laugh and watch on as everyone becomes closer. If you want to watch a story with plot, Jojo is always there for you to watch. And obviously the age of the females in the show is a tad too low, but it&#039;s not like they emphasize on that. I&#039;m always satisfied at the end of each episode and would recommend this to anyone and everyone reading. Please give this anime a chance, and try to remember that not every anime is a plot filled tear jerker, and that some are made to be enjoyed for what they really are.

    I have a rule: I must sit through several (or all of them if the series is done airing) episodes before writing a review or forming any sort of opinion and I try not to be quick to judge a series with a few rare exceptions. But oh goodness, please, forgive me, I couldn&#039;t, I simply couldn&#039;t take this anymore because I feel like my nerve cells were irreparably damaged. Anime is supposed to entertain, not shorten one&#039;s life.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10.<br />
There is not much to say about it because I really cannot approve of a plot about a 13-year-old girl drawing lewd illustrations while her brother,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249046">
        a young novelist, pretty much allows it (despite a brief apology in the first episode). Yes, I am aware of how low the age of consent in Japan is, so this is my culture and mentality speaking here, but I fail to understand what&#039;s so entertaining about this, neither do I think it&#039;s okay just because the heroine is technically of age. This is downright unacceptable, as well as disgusting, and I am not willing to tolerate an anime that sexualizes minors and makes them say that they love, pardon me, dicks. To each their own, perhaps, but this anime is supposed to be a simple comedy yet it fails to find balance between risks and what can be considered funny and appropriate. Eromanga-sensei tries to be funny and fails on a scale so epic that it&#039;s practically cringe-worthy.<br />
Now here is the thing: I actually enjoyed the first season of OreImo despite its risky themes. Yes, I see OreImo&#039;s flaws neither do I approve of Kirino&#039;s favorite genre and maybe things get worse later on, but at least OreImo was entertaining in comparison to whatever this circus is.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10.<br />
Smooth animation and the fact that I like this show&#039;s art style are its only redeeming qualities, if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10.<br />
Cutesy songs plus forgettable soundtrack. I always give this aspect 5 out of 10 when I cannot seem to remember anything, which means that there was nothing worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10.<br />
I. Don&#039;t. Understand. Any of them. So here we have these two siblings-but-not-really as they are not related by blood, which is, apparently, an excuse to push their possibly romantic relationship down our throats. No, thank you. Masamune refers to Sagiri as his little sister, acknowledging her as one, so I do not think it&#039;s cute or funny. Not even a bit. These two are weird, painfully bland and boring and driven by horrible logic that is beyond my understanding. If it goes on like this, things will get out of hand. Of course, that&#039;s what this show is about, risky themes and relatively lewd semi-incest relationship between two kids and one of them just reached the age of consent (in accordance with Japanese laws, but most of us here still see her as a minor as we have our own laws to rely on).<br />
Both Sagiri and her so-called brother are as blank as a sheet of paper. Masamune is a cheap copy Kyousuke Kosaka and has a personality of a toothpick. He is not believable or relatable and, as a result, it is almost impossible to like him because he doesn&#039;t make you feel anything. Sagiri, in the meantime, is laughable: a loli tsundere that, apparently, doesn&#039;t even know what the hell she wants. Infantile to the point of acting like a 6-year-old (she&#039;s 13), she is a cute but very annoying character and her adorable face does not count as a redeeming quality. Summing it up, both Masamune and his sister-but-not-really are ridiculously immature and unlikable. Given that they are protagonists of the series, that is not a way to go.<br />
Don&#039;t get me started on the rest of the cast, Megumi Jinno in particular, someone needs to slap this girl once or twice, she collects friends like Pokemon and is too perverted for a 13-year-old. How is that funny? <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10.<br />
This show is boring and sometimes it can be pretty confusing and downright disgusting and, as much as I&#039;d like to be brave and believe that it gets better, I can&#039;t. Maybe it does, but I do not want to know.<br />
<br />
I do not have any siblings, but I have friends who are like siblings to me and I cannot even imagine how or why a show like this can be considered funny. I gave it 3/10 and maybe, just maybe I am not harsh enough. I don&#039;t know if it gets better later on or not. But the truth is, I do not care much enough to be willing to figure that out. It&#039;s better to watch something else. What an utterly disgusting disappointment.

    Personally, this anime is actually pretty decent when it first started, but when I try to compare its later episode, where are of his harem came together, It became quite uninteresting, and even, unengaging when a certain episode is dedicated to a certain girl in his harem. Though, if you are going hate this show for its depiction of lewd 2D girls, who are obviously premature, then hate all the show that&#039;s out there that does the same too. Even if that includes your favorite show. Konosuba is one, they lewd Megumin. Tbh, it should be pretty normal to see such a thing in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250872">
        community that you&#039;ve gotten involved in. You may also hate this show for the somewhat revolutionary idea of romance of legal incest story, that being said, no one are going to make an actual romance of that IRL, so what&#039;s the big deal. I live in the same circumstances as this, not blood related sister and shit, if you see her as your sister, no sane person (ones that have a sister) who even want to hook up with them as a lover or as a love interest. That&#039;s only in anime and stuff from the ancient times, where King arthur fall in love with his mother without both knowing that they are related, and got kill for it or something along those line. Or, tribes, emperors, king practicing that lineage thing, where only blood related sibliings or descedent can make love and reproduce in order to keep that, idk, snobbish tradition of treating a certain blood as a part of the royalty, or being special and superior in a way from other human beings. And ofc, Eromanga is different because she&#039;s not blood related, but the general theme of the genre is the same.<br />
<br />
This quality of animation is undeniably of a pretty high quality. The characters are consistently well drawn, and their designs or character are detailed and consistent through and through (we barely see the camera angle zoomed, or angled from afar for a very long duration). It&#039;s hard to bring in subjectivity, the way you felt about the show, and lesser the quality of the art/animation through subjectivity, in order to justify a 1/10 or even lower for the art/animation of the show. In order to explain how shit this show really is. It&#039;s irrational to take irrationality (subjectivity) and apply it to rational things such as art. Art are obviously something that we all can agree on. If something looks good and well drawn, that&#039;s a good quality art. some people tries to bend logic or idea of artistic around, to push their bias view that pampered to their own irrationality and subjective feelings, over evaluating things with a certain degree of maturity and objectivity in it. The evaluation on the story are entirety subjective, though, it&#039;s hard to say the same if you are going to evaluate the external content of the anime, like the art, music, voice acting, animation (the amount of frame to frame picture that is drawn to make the animation looks smooth or not smooth) and so on. And some scene in this is actually smooth as hell. There are some cartoonish art style here and there to charaterized the character (like when sagiri do popeye looking mouth thing). And the lewd of fanservice is justified, look at the fucking title name mate. <br />
<br />
Eromanga sensei is a very fun show for its early 5 episodes and so; though, I kinda lost interest once there&#039;s this trip event in the show, as the entirety of his harem grouped up, indicating signs of wanting to be his love interest to one another (basically to their rivals in romance). I mean, it&#039;s cool how at least this anime, unlike many other harem, are extremely honest about their feeling for the MC, and even be as bold to confess their love. And this is through the used of scenery, or subtle ways of confessing, and other dramatic elements to make that scene of the confession, less boring and more romantic than any other harem series that I&#039;ve seen. <br />
<br />
That being said, there are quite a myriad of negatives when it comes to the approach, the method of developing a character, and the overly clicheness of the anime, where the show tries to be different, but done it in a pretty half assed way.<br />
<br />
As we all know, a cliche harem show is basically a show where there&#039;s only one guy with multiplicity of women, who are seeking to fight one another (though, they will still care about one another either way as a friend) just to hook up with the MC, depending on the route that the anime may take for each or all girls. I&#039;m actually pertaining to the VN of any harem series, that tend to contain a harem route, or a route that solely focused specifially on one candidate of the MC&#039;s harem. This being said, the anime tries to bring in at least other male character that seem to have no interest in girls, or bring in some random dudes into the story, pretending to be different from other harem show that we&#039;ve seen. The pretentious part here isn&#039;t the fact that this anime have other males in it, ones that who are close to the MC and in a position to communicate with people from the MC&#039;s harem that is. The pretentious part here is bringing him out of nowhere, be a part of the different event that they took place in (like the beach episode), then forcely or conveniently put him away, making his existence seem quite unneeded. It&#039;s as if he wasn&#039;t even needed in the show but they just decided to keep him there anyway. There&#039;s no point of having him take part in a certain activities with the MC and of his harem, when you&#039;re going to get rid of him during it anyway (talking about the King&#039;s game screen, the game where you draw a number, and tell them to do whatever you want). <br />
<br />
The approach of the harem is done quite horribly, it&#039;s not to say that this anime is bad as a whole for creating this horrible harem after all of the harem are introduced. It&#039;s just their way of presenting and giving only a little bits of moment for the MC and the girl of interest for a very short moment. It doesn&#039;t progresses to anything much, though, it might have created a reaction from the MC, but that either stagnated just to add in some dramatic scene in the episode, or to make the girls became even more competitive in becoming the MC&#039;s love interest. And his love for his little sister is a barrier for the MC to not hook up with other women, just like the very popular meme, &quot;I love emilia&quot; scene, rip Rem.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
On a side note, you also call any author of such medium like a manga writer, light novel writer etc as sensei in the otaku community (everyone calls them that, see the anime man interviews with spice of wolf author, or konosuba author, or shirobako and bakuman, an anime on the production making of manga and anime industry). <br />
<br />
The actual story maybe about that rivaly thing in regards to being an author and all. So it&#039;s not weird for the story to be about it, but the anime neglected this aspect, and proceeds on towards the typical harem moment rather than focusing more so on the main aspect of the story, and that&#039;s, striving for success in the industry (mainly for the MC&#039;s case since other authors are more successful than him). And anime move the plot quite slowly as well, that&#039;s prolly a down side of the show if you hate seeing characters spending time together (having fun), and developing some kind of a relationship with those interactions. It&#039;s pretty slice of life-ish if I were to describe it.<br />
<br />
The anime followed a typical template of a typical harem show, though that&#039;s not a negative of the show, since every story in other community does the same. Deadpool for example, it follows the exact same template like any typical hero shows, and the hero&#039;s journey (the infamous outline for hero&#039;s story that everyone accidentally followed). The matter of criticizing the show here is how it was done, and how do you like it personally. This part is really subjective to one&#039;s taste, since people expect different things from a story, and our definition of entertainment are never entirely the same. <br />
<br />
And that being said, this show has a great start, the quality drops though from its early episodes once all the harem is introduced, however, this is not a bad show. There are a number of negatives and positive in this show. But tbh, this show is pretty cute and fanservice heavy it maybe, it&#039;s a fucking fanservice show on premature girls and that isn&#039;t new at all in the otaku community. It&#039;s for a very niche audience that likes it. If you hate people lewding premature girls, hearing them saying lewd things like, &quot;I want to see your panties&quot;, &quot;all girls my age love dicks&quot; etc. This anime is not for you.

    Best of All Time<br />
<br />
The noble pursuit of every man : to find the person he/she loves, is the very core of theme of this anime. The main character loves his little sister, the little sister loves his older brother, the main character&#039;s rival loves the main character, the main character&#039;s senpai loves the main character, and the little sister&#039;s friend loves penis.<br />
<br />
10/10 they don&#039;t put no shame and bullsht to this anime. No self-revelation bullsht. No Harem bullsht because the main character has stated to everyone that he wants to bang his sister. No misunderstanding bullsht, the main character not some dense fgt who doesn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268186">
        know anything about any other character&#039;s feeling. 10/10 no bullsht.<br />
<br />
10/10 classic romance, adolescence fun, and sister-banging. You know those anime with the main characters can&#039;t even confess their love? this has none of that bullsht. Instead, our main boy confess to his sister directly in the middle of the series with love letter as classy as he can get. <br />
<br />
That f-ing middle schooler girl just said : &quot;I like penis&quot; in her introduction, the first screentime she get and that what she said. It&#039;s genius, it showed her character immidiately no bullsht. And it made sense too, she said that to the much older brother of a main character, it showed that she is an adult psychologically and likes to be considered one by a fellow adult, main boi.<br />
<br />
The little sister, Sagiri, is the ultimate little sister. He loves his brother no tsundere bullsht. and she&#039;s NOT BLOOD RELATED to our main boi. (this is an important concept as why so many people don&#039;t understand this as why people get this rating 6).

    Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... And my arm... even my fingers... The body I&#039;ve lost... the comrades I&#039;ve lost... won&#039;t stop hurting... It&#039;s like they&#039;re all still there. You feel it, too, don&#039;t you? I&#039;m gonna make them give back our time. is what i thought after seeing tis anime it was a waste of time and to think its by a1 picture so the basic story id that our main protag is a mangaka and his illustrator who is a ero doushjin drawer turns out to be his shut in sister who somehow isnt

    Eromanga-sensei is the portrait of an unusual comedy that plays with the morbid side of the mind. Moreover, the show salvages some ideas from other anime in search of acceptance. In the end, Eromanga-sensei only offers an unsatisfaction with an overused harem story and with some misleading sexual concepts.<br />
<br />
The average: The anime started with a promising 8.23 and ended with a miserable 6.97. The 12 years old girl sexual behaviour. The silly and unrealistic story. <br />
<br />
The good: Some hilarious moments and few characters.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, the biggest mistake is the story. Even if we eliminate the infamous incest debate, we end up with an empty harem story.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264873">
        A laddie with a collection of girls between the ages of twelve and fifteen who fall in love with the protagonist, an overused story romance in the anime world. To deceive the viewer with a new plot, an erroneous perception is created in which this promiscuous group is as functional as any group of adults to the extreme where they are most successful and can take their own decisions that are not in accordance with their ages. No one has ever asked, ¿where are the adults in this series? So far you will notice two, but they are mere puppets who try to propel dysfunctional relationships. The show portrays three young characters (Masamune, Elf and Muramasa) who are famous light novels writers and a twelve-year-old lassie (Sagiri) who is an erotic sketcher known as Eromanga-sensei. The irony is that this lassie, despite her alleged inexperience has developed sexual tastes or fetishes out of nuffink that can not be explained logically and credibly. To play a little more with your mind, this lassie lives with the laddie. In addition, she is his sister, but with a small countermeasure, she is a step-sister. For some persons they can hook together for others could be a problem. It is up to you which one is your side. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s remove the sexual part for a bit because I need to be honest. The show is full of incoherency even for a comedy. ¿Are you going to believe that this little lassie locked herself in her room without any visual contact and this laddie never even bothered entering and see if she was ok? ¿Will you laugh after seeing a child, kid, youth locked in a room for several months without any visual contact? I bet that MOST all the persons will take the door down and see if the kid is ok or will try to seek help immediately. Don&#039;t play with our intelligence that argument is so lame that none will bite for it. Also, the irrational success case of the characters (they have published novels, and some have sold more than a professional writer).<br />
<br />
Now the sexual part, the main topic of the comedy. In one hand,  the relationship concept misleading the meaning of relationship or &quot;romance&quot; expressed in the constant sexual insinuation of a twelve years old girl. I need to repeat it, a twelve years old girl. The continuous  story twist hidden under the timid face of a kid &quot;Brother,  you are an idiot and a pervert&quot; twist &quot;I want Elf&#039;s panties.&quot; Scenes that play with the morbid desires of the mind, pushed by every panty angle in search of spectators. Second, the sexual misleading &quot;you are a pervert, but I like drawing erotic scenes&quot; or &quot;Can I see your penis?&quot; Third, the overused harem concept. All these ideas continuously resemble the fetishism introduced in this anime, and if you don&#039;t like them, then you will feel this anime as an immediate failure. I am not saying that this anime is a total waste, there are some exciting scenes and they could have used that scenes a bit more (final episode 9).<br />
<br />
About the characters, nothing is relevant. A guy and lots of lolis that love him or want to have a relationship with him. Most all them are more successful than any adult, and some have unexplained sexual desires. If we let Sagiri&#039;s relation out of the spectrum then we can appreciate some characters like the promiscuous and introvert personality of Elf Yamada to the timid and polite nature of Muramasa but sadly if we add Sagiri to the equation, Masamune&#039;s relations are unbalanced and in some cases forced. <br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t bad. The definition of the characters was good. However, you will enjoy it just if you like the story if not the art will be irrelevant. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED songs are good. The OP was part of the J-Pop Billboard and the Oricon ranking. About the score, it is simple and matches the comedy moments.   <br />
<br />
Finally, I don&#039;t suggest this anime for kids. It has some sexual concepts that aren&#039;t explained and can lead to a misconception if you don&#039;t understand the difference between the joke and the reality.

    I dont understand why people hate this series though.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna make myself clear first though. I liked this anime, even though I hated OreImo. I know its the same author, but this anime is really, really fun. I dont enjoy anime as much as I did before, so I watch a lot of ep1 of new season anime usually drop most of them (I didnt even watch one anime properly last season) but this anime... I&#039;ve been watching it a lot. I guess its because they really did a good job when to tell the story and when to make people laugh. Props to them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247086">
        for that.<br />
<br />
---Story---<br />
<br />
It&#039;s understandable to see people not liking it, because its really cliche at this point. But for those who say &quot;its OreImo&quot; no its not. I didnt even enjoy OreImo a bit. It was boring. Especially the second season. Story telling was bad, characters felt hollow. I didnt read the novels for OreImo but for anime it just felt like, they found a scene from it to make one ep, then found a completely different thing in it then made another ep from it. Story was really slow on that one. But in this one its really fun, I read the novels for Eromanga and they are really follow the novel well. Novel&#039;s story telling is great, and in anime they made it great too.<br />
<br />
---Art---<br />
<br />
Art is good, but its not detailed. Not like I want a detailed art from this kind of series though. <br />
<br />
---Sound---<br />
<br />
It&#039;s great. It doesnt feel like its a comedy soundtrack for a serious moment like it does for modern anime (check Saijaku Muhai) For anime ED and OP <br />
both of them are great.<br />
<br />
---Character---<br />
<br />
Now I dont understand the complaints here. None of these characters feel hollow except for Tomoe, but she doesnt have enough screen-time for it anyways. Characters are great. I wont talk each of them here, but heres an example. MC doesnt feel like he doesnt have a life other than the screen-time he has for example. Sure it isnt realistic but this isnt like Berserk or Steins;Gate really. It&#039;s a romantic comedy. <br />
<br />
<br />
---Enjoyment---<br />
<br />
I&#039;m quite happy that I finally found an anime that I can watch it without getting bored. It&#039;s been a while since I enjoyed an anime this much, I cant really explain it well, sure heroine is good looking but when they dont show her that much this anime is still fun. <br />
<br />
---Overall---<br />
<br />
go watch it
