    If you&#039;re not into ecchi shows, steer away. If you like them, maybe you&#039;ll enjoy Kanokon. If you like wolf/fox girls as well, Kanokon is a show you probably want to watch.<br />
<br />
The premise is basic, and not really original. The &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; girl (Chizuru), who also happens to be a fox spirit, is totally in love with the most lady-shy boy (Kouta) around. Then another one comes (Nozomu), she is a wolf spirit at that, and guess what? She happens to love him too. They both fight for his attention with a lot of ecchi antics, and the rest I&#039;ll leave to your imagination...<br />
<br />
The story itself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6534">
        is pretty much an episode-by-episode story; there&#039;s not a lot of stuff that binds the episodes together. The ecchi-ness isn&#039;t lacking; Chizuru and Nozomu&#039;s ecchi-filled attempts at winning Kouta&#039;s affection comes out of nowhere sometimes, and if you&#039;re a fan of it, you&#039;ll more than likely enjoy it..<br />
<br />
The animation wasn&#039;t all that; everyone looked much younger than they actually are - Kouta looks like he&#039;s an elementary school student when he&#039;s actually a high school student. That has its impact on the overall feel of the show (ecchi + people who looks like elementary school students = bad combination), but you&#039;ll probably get used to it. At least I did. Aside that, the animation quality is fair enough.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is average, nothing spectacular, but nothing out of place either. The OP and ED themes are fair too, but not something I&#039;d listen to aside when watching the show. Voice acting is okay too, though Kouta sounds like he&#039;s an elementary school student too &amp;gt;_&amp;lt;<br />
<br />
The characters are nothing really special. No character development, and no original characters can drag down the enjoyment factor if you&#039;re picky when it comes to that.<br />
<br />
Overall, this was a fair show, but nothing exceptional.<br />
<br />

    Kanokon never gave me a boring moment to think about why I am watching this. First off, this is a &quot;love it, or hate it&quot; anime. Those who can withstand the ecchiness will love it, else they&#039;ll find it very annoying or to some extend even disgusting (repulsive is the word I am getting at...). It is plainly obvious that the anime is targeting the MALE audience. Yes girls, this anime is NOT FOR YOU! With that in mind, we&#039;ll proceed with the review.<br />
<br />
This is perhaps THE closest anime to hentai you can ever find (well, lets just say it is at least on par

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4872">
        to the well know fan service friendly Ikkitousen series). The ecchiness of Kanokon is beyond imagination! Though the rating states &quot;Mild Nudity&quot;, I think it is more appropriate for it to say &quot;Heavy Nudity&quot; (especially after watching episode 7).<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
For a 12 episode long anime, the story is bit on the slow side at the beginning. Though I understand that some episodes were needed for character development.  It is nice on one hand that the producer managed to wrap things up with various couples in the show, but there were still mysteries left unresolved. The most notable one is the mystery behind the young girl with the teddy bear. Perhaps they will cover that in the manga (if it’s not already been covered), or perhaps there’ll be a 2nd season for Kanokon, we’ll wait and see.<br />
<br />
Artwork:<br />
The artwork was a bit weird for me at first (mainly the eyes and the cheeks…they look really “cartoon-ish”), but after getting used to it, the animation quality is actually quite nice.<br />
<br />
Others:<br />
Nothing particular to comment on regarding the sound (though the opening is quite good for the show). Characters are all very lively (though not always in a believable way). <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Overall, the anime is very very enjoyable if you are planning on watching ecchi anime to begin with. But for those who are in fact intending to watch hentai, then you might be disappointed (well perhaps you can try the DVD specials, those are known for intense fan service).<br />
Lastly, I would like to praise the director for doing a job well done. He has so cleverly made an anime just bordering the 17+/18+ line. I can’t imagine watching this on prime time anime channels here in my country.

    I really feel like I need a shower and a delousing after watching this show.  Kanokon manages to be one of the most perverted and in many ways disturbing things I have ever watched.  It’s fortunate that it was short, because I doubt that I could have finished it had it been any longer.<br />
<br />
Kanokon basically doesn’t have a story.  A weak an uninteresting boy starts his year at a new high school where he is inexplicably besieged by hot girls.  Standard echii anime fare here.  The problem is nothing interesting ever happens.  Kouta tries to avoid the affections of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7864">
        all the girls throwing themselves at him and the girls just keep trying, getting more and more outrageous as the series unfolds.  There is some comedy to be found though.  Kanokon does have its moments, if you can suspend your disbelief over Kouta and his lack of manliness.  The interactions between Chizuru and all her rivals for his affections are pretty funny.  Though after a while even this becomes less funny after you see the same joke for the tenth time.<br />
<br />
The thing that bothered me the most however was the characters.  Well one in particular.. Kouta.  Why are all these girls throwing themselves at a weak, boring, underdeveloped boy who looks like he should be entering the 3rd grade instead of being in High School.  High School? Really?  Seeing this boy get molested episode after episode made me want to call the police more than it made me laugh.  Chizuru and Nozomu are really the only highlights of the show from a character aspect.  They are the only ones who are genuinely funny or even slightly interesting.  However the fox/wolf spirit aspect of the pair are never properly developed and seem to have been added solely to bridge the time in between Kouta&#039;s next molestation.<br />
<br />
Visually Kanokon looks great.  Despite Chizuru&#039;s gravity defying measurements she is still pretty adorable as are the other girls.  Again Kouta takes points away because of the way he looks.  The voice acting is really good and it does save the series in some respects.  Though not even one of my favorites Mamiko Noto could make me like Kouta.  The music is also very strong.<br />
<br />
If you are a diehard harem fan and love fan service, loli&#039;s, fox-spirits, hentai, and huge breasts smothering small children this is your show!  Anyone else should preserve the IQ points you will lose watching it.<br />

    Holy crap, it&#039;s finally over! The anime of my dreadful loathing! This anime was just so bad, I HAD to write a review on it. <br />
<br />
Kanokon was obviously made with horny sex craving  boys as its audience. You want fanservice? It has fanservice. You want naked chicks? This anime has it. In fact, this anime goes over-the-top borderline with its sexual innuendos, activities and visual eye candy. The main character, Kouta, is stalked by two girls, both being what men usually crave. The ready-and-willing big-breasted pretty girl, and the ready-and-willing breast-less loli character. Both want sex from him, and will do anything to do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5755">
        it. To sum it up, this anime is probably the closest you&#039;ll get to a hentai without it actually being a hentai.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The story was mediocre, at best. I loved the whole &#039;demons and spirits mingle with the humans&#039;, thing, but that&#039;s about where it ended. The arc with the little loli-girl and her Nue partner was the closest this series got to an actual plot, and was probably the  only part of the series I really enjoyed, since it mildly turned away from the ecchi to focus on action and combat. The fact that two girls follow and want to bed one boy who looks like he should be in grade-school was enough to turn me off. I&#039;m a girl, and I love my shota, but this is just unbelievably unrealistic to a very fine degree. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
This is where the anime really shines. The art is undeniably some of the best in the anime released this spring, and I probably won&#039;t forget the beauty of Kanokon&#039;s style anytime soon. To be honest, it was probably the art that made me stick with and endure the show to the last episode. Even I have to admit that the animation remained smooth throughout the entire series. Maybe when animating the males it fell slightly, but when doesn&#039;t that happen when you&#039;re watching an ecchi or harem anime? The Art would have gotten a perfect 10 if it wasn&#039;t for my lingering thoughts that the animation was made like this solely to tune up the ecchi.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Not really much to say here. The only really great point of the sound is the voice-acting. Of course, to most that&#039;s the whole deal right? I don&#039;t really remember the music that much, so that goes to show that it wasn&#039;t all too good in my opinion. Yeah.... this is all I can really say about the sound.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
The characters were decent enough. I didn&#039;t really like the fact that poor little Kouta&#039;s called &#039;the ero-king&#039; by all the girls and is put down by that, even though it wasn&#039;t his fault. Of course, that seems to be the fate of all boys in harem and ecchi animes. Even if a face-plant into the nearest rack was an accident, it&#039;s ALWAYS the boy&#039;s fault. Poor, poor boys. There were only three characters that succeeded in putting a smile on my face whenever they were onscreen. And that&#039;s Tayura, and the twins Ai and Ren. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Is it over yeeeet?<br />
<br />
This anime had me checking my player&#039;s episode length to see how much longer I had to suffer through another episode of boobs, sex and girls that want sex. I was so bored through most of the episodes I would pause about every eight minutes to go see what was happening elsewhere on the net. Yes. It was THAT good.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Overall? Don&#039;t watch it unless you&#039;re a boy that gets off on this kind of stuff. Or a  girl that can tolerate this anime that greatly degrades women.

    First of all, hide this anime from anyone you live with. Unless they like hentai too.<br />
<br />
Yes indeed, this is THE closest thing to hentai you will probably ever see in an anime. It&#039;s nuts. But what&#039;s underneath all the fanservice, you ask? Well, a mediocre storyline, I&#039;m sorry to say. This anime focuses all it&#039;s energy on the fanserivce (like the manga does, so no surprise there). Let&#039;s jump right in.<br />
<br />
STORY: 6/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s really not that inventive; the whole story feels like a setup so that Kouta can get into ecchi situations. Two spirit girls start liking him, a bunch of random crap happens. No real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5823">
        movement of the story, but what can you expect...<br />
<br />
ART: 6/10<br />
<br />
The whole anime I was extremely annoyed at how young Kouta looks. That&#039;s like 10 years old, man! OH well... besides that, the eye styles for the anime were new and kinda cool for a change. The rest was just mediocre<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 7/10<br />
<br />
Nothing special, nothing at all in fact. You never really see what Kouta thinks about anything else, same goes for the other characters. I would&#039;ve liked to see more of the principal, that guy cracked me up. Besides that, everyones mind is filled with 75% fanserice...<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: ~8/10<br />
<br />
This one really depends on who watches it. If you enjoy fanservice, then 10/10. If you hate it, then realize this anime is fanserice, and walk away now. that would give this a 3/10. This combined with some actually genuinely funny moments are what make up Kanokon. I actually laughed out loud at some parts, but if you&#039;re only looking for comedy, you&#039;ll have to brave the storm of fanservice or walk away. I would suggest the latter. For me, however, this was an enjoyable series.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8/10<br />
<br />
I almost always take enjoyment to be the main influence of my overall, because it should be. This anime is not about a good story, or well developed characters. It&#039;s essentially about fanservice, and although that was enjoyable at the time, it really wears off, to be honest. I walked away from Kenshin thinking &amp;quot;YES, now THAT was a true anime!&amp;quot; I walked away from Kanokon tihnking &amp;quot;why didnt I spend this time to rewatch the first 12 episodes of Kenshin?&amp;quot; At the time it was enjoyable, though, so give it a try if you like fanservice.

    Omg, this has got to be the worst anime I have ever had the misfortune to stubbornly watch all the way through .___.; I finished it when the last episode was subbed, but I&#039;ve only just thought about writing a review. Also I&#039;m tired today, so please bear with me guys ;3<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Story? HAH. There pretty much is no story. Kanokon&#039;s story is none existant. It&#039;s just about how the overly-horny-for-a-little-shouta-boy Chizuru trys to get Kouta, the boy, to have sex with her.<br />
Right at the beginning there was certain potential involving the fight scenes and the concept of Chizuru being a fox deity, but nothing was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5939">
        ever played out into anything deeper than &amp;quot;oh look, she has a tail every now and then.&amp;quot; Seriously, the writers seemed to completely forget about the supposed main story line and just had fun writing this almost-hentai script. This series is as close to hentai as you&#039;ll ever get without watching hentai itself.<br />
It&#039;s aimed for guys who get off on seeing chunky chicks like Chizuru take all her clothes off at any given oppotunity.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
Nothing special here. The very few fight scenes that were shown were fairly average, Chizuru looked like she was covered in oil all the time because she was so damn shiny, and the characters&#039; eyes were drawn funny. Not to my taste really, but then again it wasn&#039;t dreadful.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The only reason why I gave the series a 2 rather than a 1 overall was because of the music. It was absolutely beautiful, totally what I enjoy and it fitted rather well with the series as both songs were about love and physically wanting someone. Especially the ending song, sung by Sakakibara Yui. It was so upbeat in the chorus and really made me want to dance XD;<br />
<br />
Character<br />
What can I say about them that&#039;s positive? Nothing. They were boring, standard, flat, 2D, recycled and had no depth. They were there to show panties and get naked and nothing more. Boring as hell.<br />
Nozomu made me laugh at the beginning, but then she got boring. She was only there to make Chizuru want to cling onto Kouta even more. And Kouta himself, he was such a drippy little thing. Even though he obviously didn&#039;t want to do those kinds of things with Chizuru he never actually tried to stop her because he was too much of a weakling. Seriously, he really pissed me off.<br />
The only highlight was the twins, but they were barely shown. If they had been in it more, then my rating would have gone up to around a 4.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I did not enjoy this series one bit. I only watched it right the way through to the end because I really wanted to say &amp;quot;hey look, I put up with it&amp;quot; and also because I hate dropping series. And I guess I&#039;m stubborn too ^^; never again will I watch a series as dreadful and brainlessly ecchi as this.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Only watch it if you want some hardcore ecchi that is on the brink of hentai. Otherwise, miss it.<br />
<br />
If you loved this series then I&#039;m sorry that our views don&#039;t mix. But I really truly hated this pile of rubbish. :)<br />
Yeah~ hate the review if you want. But deep down, you know I&#039;m only telling the truth ;3

    Now, I read a bit of the manga before watching it, was alright. Then, I saw advertisments for the anime in magazines, and damn, it caught my eye. So when the subs came out, I downloaded them every week, watched them, and this is what I thought about it.<br />
<br />
Story: There wasn&#039;t really much of a story, as this anime was quite the slice-of-life anime. Every episode was basically Chizuru and Nozomu trying to seduce and get into the pants of the main character, Kouta. There was a fair bit of comedy, but not gut-bustingly funny. Drama around the last few episodes were very meh, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6076">
        didn&#039;t really have much effect. Every episode, I&#039;ll admit, was repetitive, but the action definitely made up for it, as I will explain below.<br />
<br />
Art: Oh damn, out of all the ecchi animes I&#039;ve watch, this one has the best art, especially the characters. Tons and tons of bare skin, to the point where people blogging the show asked if this was a soft-core hentai. The bodies, especially Chizuru, were drawn oh-so-well, really showing her figure well. The other characters were also drawn well, the animation was solid, and it made use of lots of different colours and settings effectively.<br />
<br />
Sound: Voice acting was good, but I hated Kouta&#039;s voice. This boy must have no balls, because he has the highest pitched voice in the anime, and it got DAMN ANNOYING after a few episodes.<br />
<br />
Characters: Very cliche. Kouta is the typical useless/ball-less harem lead, and I didn&#039;t like him much, due to him always trying and avoid Chizuru&#039;s advances. Chizuru was the big breasted, main character loving female character, always trying to seduce him, but I never got the impression that she was slutty much. Maybe determined is a good word.  Nozomu is the silent loli also wanting to get into Kouta&#039;s pants, and she was boring to watch. I thought that the side characters were more interesting than the main characters to watch, especially Tayura and Asahina. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This is where the anime shines. Hordes and hordes of wonderful, life giving, bloodloss-inducing, bouncy ecchiness. I loved it, this show was intended to be eye candy, and it performed very well. Hell, the ecchiness alone is enough to warrant rewatching the series, and I do plan to do that sometime.<br />
<br />
Overall: It was a very fun ride watching Kanokon every week, it was interesting enough to keep you watching it, it had more than enough action to get your blood rushing, and it was generally enjoyable to watch. Definitely one of the better ecchi/harem animes out there, and if you aren&#039;t the type to analyse every bit of the plot, characters and logic of animes, you will like this.

    Today I&#039;m going to be reviewing this anime because it absolutely has to be the worst series I&#039;ve watched <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
There really isn&#039;t much story going on <br />
The only &quot;story&quot; I see is this big breasted fox deity trying to get with this pathetic male loli character<br />
I felt like I was watching a hentai<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is just generic The skin was too shiny <br />
Sometimes it looked like the characters didn&#039;t have noses<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Sound was the only decent thing about this series The OP and ED were alright<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
No character development in this series<br />
Girls don&#039;t even act this gross in reality<br />
Chizuru:<br />
For someone that&#039;s supposedly 400 years old you would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150707">
        think she&#039;d be more mature<br />
But she&#039;s just annoying and is just begging to get into this kid&#039;s pants<br />
I don&#039;t understand what she sees in him<br />
<br />
Kouta:<br />
He&#039;s one of the most disgusting male leads He looks like an 8 year old <br />
There&#039;s nothing attractive about him<br />
He acts like he tries to hold back but he still ends up doing sexual things with Chizuru<br />
I for one find it disgusting when he licks Chizuru&#039;s *ss<br />
<br />
Nozomu:<br />
Also begging to get in Kouta&#039;s pants <br />
She clearly has no respect for herself just like Chizuru<br />
She even tried to have a 3 way with them<br />
<br />
The other characters didn&#039;t have much purpose so I won&#039;t get into them<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
There really isn&#039;t any <br />
I forced my way through this series<br />
This is more aimed at the male audience <br />
<br />
Overall I give it a 1 I&#039;d give it less but I can&#039;t

    This anime is like an ecchi Mamoru-kun ni Megami no Shukufuku wo! and I&#039;m not kidding.So watching this show makes you feel like that Kouta is a lucky guy because he has two girls on him and wants to... you know... with him, but then you would feel sorry for him beacause he&#039;s been called the erotic king and everything is a whole misunderstanding. Well it is ecchi, but its not as ecchi as some shows like Girls Bravo and so.

    Hello boys and girls,<br />
I&#039;ve looked through several &quot;so-so&quot; and &quot;outright trash&quot; kind of reviews and I feel it&#039;s necessary to say a word in defense of Kanokon.<br />
Because I think that it&#039;s a masterpiece in it&#039;s niche.<br />
<br />
Ok, everybody open your eyes now.<br />
It&#039;s E C C H I (full stop).<br />
The essense of it. And all the rest just doesn&#039;t matter.<br />
No main male character - don&#039;t care (actually he is, but Kouta is as good as no main character).<br />
No plot - it&#039;s irrelevant.<br />
If you complain that Kanokon is missing some (or all) of those element - you are right. But don&#039;t forget that ecchi (as any other genre)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20010">
        rarely walks alone. You might have grown used to ecchi + romance or something else.<br />
And Kanokon is just ecchi that conquers all.<br />
<br />
Kanokon is walking on the very thin ledge: between ecchi and hentai (yep, 18+ strict!). And I found Kanokon to be even better than hentai (just like striptease is better than just boringly naked woman).<br />
<br />
12 episodes are just fine - it stops even before it could get boring.<br />
<br />
Concerning perversions (and necessity to be a pervert to watch this anime): my dear folks, you&#039;d better watch Disney ;)<br />
<br />
Finally, love it or just turn it off (as with any other anime)  ^ _ ^

    I was a bit bored and i heard that kanokon was pretty funny and it included a little bit of ecchiness which I&#039;m OK with.  Then after about episode 2 i thought to myself &quot;why am i watching this instead of porn?&quot;<br />
<br />
I found it incredibly difficult to swallow this anime mainly because i hated the main character, Kouta.  Kouta is the definition of pussy.  Hes some 10 year old super small, shy, gay, pussy assed little kid.  That&#039;s all i can say.  I really think that they could have made this show hilarious if they had replaced the main lead

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43061">
        with a more masculine douche bad type of guy.  It may sound bad, but i could see this anime being beyond hilarious if that happened.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  I just couldn&#039;t really enjoy this, because im just not into a little 10 year old being raped by a foxy babe. That&#039;s dumb. I mean some of the situations are funny, but the wolf is a bitch too.  The only person that i liked was Chizuru, maybe it was the boobs talking but she was the only fairly likable character.  <br />
<br />
The sound was ok, but if you really want to enjoy this a fraction of a bit more you would need to watch the Japanese version.  The dub was just bad.  You could tell that the people were reading that shit off a piece of paper and theyre reactions sucked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though this anime may have its faults (A lot of them) I felt that this anime could have been so much more, WHY?  Its because Kouta the little pussy just ruins it for me.  I have never seen such a little pussy in my life.  It makes me feel like beating him up and banging Chizuru myself and then replacing him with a more masculine guy to at least make the anime 500 times funnier.

    Between the 10 Freeway, Downtown Los Angeles traffic, and missing the first hour of a cyber security conference, what did I dislike the most of those eventful two days? That would be the anime show I was watching as I sat in the car. It took us roughly two hours to travel between Destination A and Destination B, both ways as the traffic wouldn&#039;t let up. Kanokon was the show that I was happening to watch; oddly enough, I was looking for an ecchi show as I waited. Its 12-episode length allowed me to finish the entire show within the span of the trips since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111101">
        it was a two-day conference, and it wasn&#039;t gridlock or 90-degree heat that made this show a horrible watch. I have determined that the show itself is the reason why this show is not a good show.<br />
<br />
Kanokon is your typical ecchi, your typical fantasy show, your typical harem-style show, with one minor detail: it&#039;s all completely pointless. How pointless? It&#039;s a knife that doesn&#039;t cut, nor is it meant to spread butter, nor is it heavy enough to act as a paperweight. It&#039;s a pencil that doesn&#039;t write and the eraser is as rock-solid as a brick. It&#039;s a love story that&#039;s actually worse than Twilight, as the notorious Internet meme goes. Don&#039;t get me wrong. I am attempting to avoid misleading you into thinking that I hate this show out of pure spite, which is why I will try to write what I saw in this show without giving it a personal bias.<br />
<br />
Well, I did say that I would try.<br />
<br />
Story: What if you were stuck in a world of spirits and &quot;yokai&quot; and demons and devils, and there were a couple of things that you&#039;ve been made aware of? Spirits cannot harm humans and a kiss can transfer powers between two individuals, and a whole mess of demons do not approve of your questionable love affair? I think I described the world of Kanokon in a nutshell, but for those who want to ask &quot;why does this happen&quot;, or &quot;what background does it have behind it&quot; or &quot;is there anything else?&quot; Unfortunately, that&#039;s all I picked up. There&#039;s no history behind the spirits aside from the given that they co-exist with humans and the storyline has no other motive behind it other than allowing fan service to exist. How can I rephrase that? &quot;It&#039;s the plot that works for plot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, look at that. A cheesy line to describe a cheesy storyline.<br />
<br />
Art: Fan service comes in droves; there&#039;s no end to it. The funny thing about it is the way they try to make it look important to the storyline, but when you come right down to it, take out the fan service and it has absolutely nothing to do with the way the story progresses. All they did showcase was  a timid prepubescent boy and a girl with an insatiable sex drive using any excuse they could to take a stab at attempted intercourse.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s such a shame as well. To make up for everything else that this show lacks in, fan service HAS to present itself. I&#039;m sure for those who prefer fan service in their shows, Kanokon will be an easy show for them to get along with, but for those who enjoy it in moderation, Kanokon is definitely a show to avoid like the ex-girlfriend that is desperately trying to contact you at 12:00 midnight.<br />
<br />
Character: If the characters rolled out of a factory, which I&#039;m sure was really the case, each one of them has exemplified everything that was wrong with Chevy in the 1980&#039;s. There&#039;s nothing special about them and most of them seem like they have a screw loose. The protagonist, for example, Minamoto Chizuru, has no reason to love Kouta, the male lead. We&#039;re never given a proper reason, yet she does (and it may be safe to say that dropping her on her head was a normal childhood occurrence). It doesn&#039;t stop at a simple interest, which is acceptable in this situation; it is a wild addiction that turns her into a first-class whore every time she is in contact with Kouta. Speaking of Kouta, I have never seen a more useless male lead, one that is easily molded by anything that flies in his direction, like grains of sand or the common housefly. He also objects to Chizuru&#039;s physical affection, but why is it that at the end of the series, he can finally muster up the courage to say he loves her? I&#039;m pretty sure down the line, he gave up and allowed Chizuru to have her way with him, however the hell that&#039;s about to happen.<br />
<br />
The support cast are somehow the most appealing characters in this entire show, with the exception of the antagonists. The antagonists make just as much sense as the main cast, who will set the stage for a fight for a few reasons: to declare love for no good reason, to test someone for no good reason, or to pick a fight for no good reason. One of the antagonists that picks a fight tries to take Chizuru from Kouta, and after he is hit with one energy beam, he packs up and leaves as if nothing happened because he is a cowardly pretty boy who was more worried about the smudge on his leather coat than losing the girl he &quot;likes&quot; to a 6th grade kid. Another spirit comes along, begins attacking Chizuru, and after trading one or two blows, she leaves and says, &quot;oh, I was just testing you.&quot; What&#039;s the point of that? If I wanted to test something, I&#039;d just become a teacher and hand out tests to everyone that walks into the classroom. The last couple just attacks them. Why? Why would you want to attack someone without any reason? &quot;Oh yes, it would be fun, wouldn&#039;t it-&quot; come off it already. Now you&#039;re just confirming your stupidity.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I mentioned above that this is a fantasy show. Fantasy shows generally come with action. Kanokon, unfortunately, has fighting sequences. Why is it unfortunate? Because fight sequences stop themselves halfway before finishing. Each of the antagonists flee halfway through the battle, and this paves the stage for multiple anti-climactic sequences, which become quite tedious to watch. Maybe I&#039;m expecting too much from an ecchi show, but what if I compared it to a show like Omamori Himari? That&#039;s a harem with ecchi scenes AND action, and they pulled it off correctly. Why couldn&#039;t Kanokon do it? Or rather, what blender did you use to screw up this show so badly, and what setting was it on?<br />
<br />
As always, I&#039;m only a fan of ecchi in moderation. Since I&#039;m not the type of guy to enjoy shows filled to the brim with fan service, I&#039;ll have to let you decide that for yourself; do you watch for the plot or do you watch for the plot?<br />
<br />
Overall: Believe it or not, I have a least favorite anime that&#039;s not called Kanokon. Despite all that I can say about this show, I would still watch it in front of Air Gear, which would be as rock bottom as rock bottom gets for me, unless another show wants to take its place. Sure, it avoided being one of my most disliked shows, but it&#039;s still much closer to the bottom of my list than it is to the top. I do know that shows have potential to reach greater heights if they would just throw out a good number of useless elements, but Kanokon lacks any of that potential. There&#039;s no story, the characters are flimsy pushovers, and fan service has always been a useless addition to any show. I know a good number of people out there enjoyed it much more than I did, but Kanokon isn&#039;t just a bad show. It&#039;s a bad show with a fanbase. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mind if you took my words and said, &quot;oh, I&#039;m watching this show anyways.&quot; In fact, I couldn&#039;t care less what you did with your time just as long as it doesn&#039;t cut into mine. But there are only two paths you can take with this show: love it and dismiss every word of offense towards this show or hate it and end up realizing that you wasted a good chunk of your time watching bad characters look like they&#039;re about to do something.<br />
<br />
And a note to the writers: next time you want to blend something, I recommend that you use my personal choice, the Vita-Mix 5000. It juices everything in the cup fairly well and the end result is a delicious smoothie.

Boobs. Bothered yet? Boobies, melons, bosoms, fun-bags, playthings, tits, breasts. Still not bothered? Well, you have passed the &quot;Kanokon&quot; test, my friend. Welcome to a magical anime, filled with boobs, boobs, and, yet, more boobs.<br />
<br />
The way the story begins sets the tone for the rest of the story. Not in the way that they continue to develop it, more like they let you know that it&#039;s there, basically causing all the drama in the series, but let &quot;mini-arcs&quot;, spanning an episode or two, act as the story for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20853">
        the show.<br />
As you could imagine - it&#039;s predictable. And, oddly enough, it was a nice predictable. I was never, EVER, bored watching &quot;Kanokon&quot; and I don&#039;t think you should be either. Unless you didn&#039;t pass my Kanokon test.<br />
To me, it&#039;s not really a harem as much as it is a borderline hentai/rom/com. There&#039;s one other girl, but she seems like a third-wheel. You know from the get-go that she won&#039;t win our hero&#039;s heart and the other, more &quot;main&quot; heroine will likely come out on top. However, each mini-arc is enough to keep me entertained, and the base arc of her being a fox deity keeps up the quickfire pace (as it should be) of this 12-episode-long anime. 7/10.<br />
<br />
The art, well... it acted like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you have fabulously drawn characters and their movements are captured flawlessly. On the other hand, you have a hero who acts and looks like he could be a 10-year-old girl. I don&#039;t want my hero who&#039;s involved in a HAREM to be a 10-year-old girl. Coy and shy is okay to an extent, but when you put his animated character and personality together you really get an immature hero that&#039;s hard to root for, hard to identify with, and too childish. 6/10.<br />
<br />
Sound is sound. I found this anime&#039;s sound to be a nice, refreshing change of pace from the constant yelling in &quot;Seto no Hayame&quot;. The voice actors are good; that ten-year-old girl lookalike hero just bugged the hell out of me and his voice definitely matched his small presence and stature. 7/10.<br />
<br />
Like I&#039;ve stated above, I had a big problem with our hero being the hero. That said, the rest of the cast was good and solid. I wished that I would&#039;ve seen a little more of the wolf deity woman (the name slips my mind at the moment) and that her involvement with the main character was more substantial. The supporting cast is variously funny and witty dialog is interjected here-and-there by the likes; a solid batch of characters. <br />
<br />
You know, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought I would. Coming into this I knew I was going to be bombarded with hentai-esque images and ecchi moments everywhere, but that really gave the show its own, specific, identity. &quot;I am &#039;basically a soft-core porn show and so what?&#039;&quot; <br />
If the anime that I watch has comes to terms with what it IS, instead of catering to something that it is NOT, I will enjoy it much more thoroughly than an anime that seems to be &quot;faking&quot;. (Pun intended.) 8/10.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think the 1-10 options and word classifcations pretty much nail this one of the head: &quot;Good&quot;. Nothing spectacular, nothing revolutionary. Just some good ol&#039; ecchi/harem/rom/com fun that&#039;s a fun time to watch and let your mind drift elsewhere - probably under the chair. 7/10.

    Hey all, Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews are rampaging across the internet once again! Today&#039;s pertinent information is that I&#039;m discussing the dubbed version of this anime, and this includes the two episode OVAs. To get to the quick of things, this anime is just terrible. It needs to be taken out behind the barn and shot. If you could only skip one show, this one would be a very strong contender. I would burn down the RTLR wall before putting anyone from this anime on it. Let&#039;s begin this fox hunt.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
I make no bones about enjoying the ecchi or harem genre of shows. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310875">
        watched Highschool DxD, Testament of Sister New Devil, Omamori Himari, and while I didn&#039;t find all them stellar, I have to say that they are all cream of the crop when compared to this series. This anime is nothing but walking plot holes, and is full of nothing but fanservice without reason. Now I said in my Testament review that the sexual parts were horribly abused, but it at least had a shred of a storyline, this show does not. We are expected to be happy as bugs in a rug with ecchi content purely for ecchi&#039;s sake. <br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re not interested in sexual innuendo sprinkled LIGHTLY with a half assed plot of the primary female being a fox girl who can sprout a tail and fox ears on command, then you&#039;re in the wrong neighborhood for sure. The fox girl does nothing throughout the entire series than sexually proposition the MC (who is around 15 but looks and sounds as if he&#039;s 12) to the point of sexual harassment, and follows up most of the time by shoving the MC&#039;s face in between her tits, whether he wants it or not. That&#039;s pretty much how the entire thing goes, her demanding sex from the guy, him turning her down, then her groping or performing indecent acts on him. Throw in a romantic rival that is basically her opposite that he has to fend off as well, and you&#039;ve got about all your going to get from this anime. The other girl is a wolf girl as opposed to the primary being a fox, wolf has very small breasts where fox has huge knockers, wolf is rather calm in her demeanor and fox is overly emotional, and all that usual &#039;competing for attention&#039; nonsense. <br />
<br />
Do we ever find out why the fox girl is in love with the MC? No. Do we find out why wolf girl is too? No. Do we ever learn why fox girl and her older brother live alone when her mother and sister live elsewhere? No. As an aside, fox mom hits on this 12 year old looking boy as well, to the point in the OVAs to where she LITERALLY whips out her tits and jiggles them in front of the MC. We basically don&#039;t get a single shred of background or world building of any kind in the entire series. It&#039;s all about fox girl begging for sex and MC continuously rejecting her only to have her smash her breasts in his face. Fox girl sometimes goes to great lengths to set up a situation where she can attempt to prey on the MC always to have it, much to the MC&#039;s relief, be ruined by wolf girl or other circumstances. <br />
<br />
An example, there is literally a scene where fox girl has her panties around her knees, and is bent over asking the MC to spank her. Fox girl has no problem at all in showing off her tits as much as possible to the guy, and sadly neither does wolf girl. The best character in the show really is a girl who is utterly outraged at the two girls&#039; behaviors, at least the flirting she witnesses. If she knew about the constant peer pressure to have sex, her head would explode. It&#039;s a bad sign when the straight laced side character is the only one that doesn&#039;t appear to be a sexual predator. <br />
<br />
Speaking of, if this anime was gender swapped, there would people marching with torches and pitchforks. If a teen guy continually pressured a younger girl to have sex, to the point of mounting and getting into position, sometimes while nude, we&#039;d all be outraged. But because it&#039;s a girl coming onto a guy, it seems to be played for laughs. I don&#039;t think its funny at all. If a guy committed sexual assault like fox girl does with her face to titties move, that would be decried as supporting &#039;rape culture&#039; and demeaning women. And that would be a fair assessment. But again, since the MC is the one not wanting sex instead of fox girl, that seems to make it all okay. <br />
<br />
It is still disturbing without the idea of a gender swap as well. If you, no matter what gender you are, do not want to have sex with a certain person, then no means no, period. Even if you&#039;re supposed to be a hormone crazed teen boy. Our MC doesn&#039;t even fit that pattern, he literally spends the series saying over and over again &quot;stop, we can&#039;t do this.&quot; He has every right to be secure in his own body, and the right to determine what he does and who he does it with. Consent in this show does not exist. Fox girl, and to a lesser extent, wolf girl are both like Bill Cosby level sexual predators. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a throwaway plot about how fox girl can kiss the MC and somehow possess him but that&#039;s only trotted out a few times, and basically forgotten for more sexual harassment. Now in the regular aired series we see that the older brother of fox girl has a crush on the straight lace girl, but if the OVAs are omitted, they have no development or resolution whatsoever. Not only that, in the ending episodes a mysterious girl and a silent bodyguard appear, make menacing comments about making the MC &#039;all hers&#039; and calling him &#039;big brother&#039;, but the pair just vanish and never come back. No explanation, nothing at all. &quot;I&#039;ll make big brother all mine next time&quot; I think is the last line this mysterious younger girl says, and then is never seen or referenced again in any manner. <br />
<br />
The two OVAs bring a scant bit of story into the mix, only with more HUGE helpings of predator fanservice. We get to see fox brother ask out straight lace girl, and she agrees to go with him to see a fireworks display. He stretches like he&#039;s going to pull the old arm around the girl act, and she shuts that down with a look that could kill, but a little later does compliment his choice of spots for viewing the fireworks. So they get a slight resolution that they might just start dating though she is still VERY conservative in her ways. <br />
<br />
Yes, at one point the MC says he loves fox girl, but I can&#039;t take that without the lingering doubt that it&#039;s coerced out of him. He also in the late episodes mentions he kind of enjoys a face full of breasts, but he hesitates to say so, making me think that maybe he says so out of fear of what would happen if he said no. There&#039;s a few moments dealing with a pair of friends from the MC&#039;s class, but they are basically throwaway filler. So we have a show about an older girl trying to have sex with a younger guy against his will, and we&#039;re supposed to find that amusing. Yeah, not happening. <br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
The show doesn&#039;t look too bad, we have the monster tit disorder that seems to plague all nudity in anime. If you&#039;re going to see nude breasts, then in most cases, her melons will be bigger than her head. Holds true here too, and that&#039;s yet another tired trope. The art doesn&#039;t look all that bad, it&#039;s just mediocre at best. <br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
The MC really does sound like he&#039;s 11 or 12. Sounds very young. The fox gilr and the wolf girl both have super annoying voices that are damn near intolerable. The rest of the cast is middle-of-the-road at best. The themes get the job done, but they are forgettable. Again the only bright spot is the straight lace girl, who is always snapping at everyone about their indecent behavior. She does sound genuinely annoyed.  Maybe the actress in real life was annoyed at the quality of the series itself. <br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
We&#039;ve talked about the characters pretty extensively there in the story section, so we&#039;ll not retread that ground so much. No one seems to have any motivation for what they do. Fox girl&#039;s mother admits to being 400 years old and still feels that it&#039;s appropriate for her to expose herself to a teenage boy, and brag about how guys still want to bang her. The fox sister seems only to be there to take up space, hardly ever saying a word. Fox brother and straight lace girl are about the only ones not over the top. And let&#039;s not forget mystery girl and her obvious preparation to become a villain later on but disappears. Maybe someone, for reasons I cannot fathom, believed they would get a second season of this bullshit. Thank God that didn&#039;t happen.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
Yeah, kinda obvious on this point, is it not? I&#039;m not being puritanical or hating on ecchi content or anything like that. It can be fun when it&#039;s done properly, but we don&#039;t have that here. We have an MC that literally tries to run away every time fox girl says &#039;let&#039;s do it!&#039; and I can&#039;t roll with that train at all. <br />
<br />
Best Girl: Bet you can guess this one already: Asahina Akane, aka straight lace girl, probably because she is the only voice of reason in the whole series, and the fact she handles herself in a mature manner. <br />
<br />
So yeah, totally a pass. The only reason I didn&#039;t drop it is that I&#039;m a completionist at heart, and a little morbid in that I wondered how they were going to up the offensive material every episode. They got it done, I gotta give them that. I tend to be positive and write good reviews, but I just couldn&#039;t let this one go. Not even bouncing titties every few minutes could inspire any optimism in me. If I convince one person to pass on this show, then I feel I have achieved something of value. Life is too short for crap like this, doing absolutely nothing is a better use of your time than watching this. Excuse me while I go find a stiff drink and try to forget this anime even exists.

    I have only seen one episode and I wondered how I even watched that, curosity I suppose, I agree with most other reviews it is fan service all over.<br />
<br />
No real story just very soft porn or hentai, a few pantie shots and boobs, just a bit of joke, how they made a series of this I do not know, and like someone else said it wouldn&#039;t be too bad if the boy was the same age but it looks like rape almost.

    Oh god, When I first heard of this show, I thought that it would be different. Why did I even think it was going to be different? The characters are perverted, and act strangely odd.<br />
<br />
The story goes way to fast, bringing up more questions then answers. All the story is becomes a love triangle with a short little kid in the middle of it. This is pretty much Hentai without the sex. It’s messed up and would be much better if they just used the sex in order to have a more interesting story line. AND THERE IS NO ENDING! It gives us a ‘read

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78283">
        the manga’ ending that always pisses me off. If I wanted to read the manga, I would of done so already or read it instead of watching the anime.<br />
<br />
Chizuru is a really interesting girl who is really hangs onto Kouta all the time. She is extremely pushy and keeps wanting him to go out with her. All this teasing really pushes him from her all the time. It also seems that all the time, she ends up trying to sleep with him. When she shows that she’s a fox, he actually for some reason doesn’t care much. Then we have the problem with him falling in love with her slightly. There is also the fact that he and her end up becoming one whenever they kiss and she wants to be with him. Nozomu doesn’t seem to have much personality in the beginning but and always seems to act like a love rival.<br />
<br />
Characters rarely have any personality out of just a standard archy types with not much of a story behind how they act. The characters are all 2 Dimensional. <br />
<br />
Now, the show actually got better as it went on, and around the 4th episode, it actually got a lot better artwork and the voices weren’t as stale. It feels like they got into the show more. Not only that but I believe it was the 5th episode where my favorite character was introduced. To bad he only stayed for one episode though. I really liked Saku Ezomori.<br />
<br />
The music in the beginning is pretty standard as well as the animation. It pretty much has a loneliness walking style to it and showing the characters. And then somehow, the main character turning into a ‘fox boy’ for some strange reason. The animation is really butt ugly in many aspects for the background characters, making them lose much detail. The main characters may be detailed in a sense but the personality is really bland. <br />
<br />
The voices… dear god the voices… They messed them all up. Chizuru is really high voiced and can probably hurt my ears. Kouta sounds like a little child, not like he would be in the same grade as all the other characters. The script is a bit choppy and again really doesn’t explain much. Sometimes the script is delivered without much feeling. Also some of the lip sinks are bad, they don’t work right.<br />

    My first review heads up.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
While lacking any real meta story (other than maybe the last two episodes), the story of each episode is what&#039;s important. However no real character development happen during these episodes and nothing really affects the overall series. If you like a series with story Kanokon is not for you.<br />
<br />
Art:6<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say about the art. The character designs are pretty generic, even the &quot;spirit form&quot; of the main character. However it is fairly fluid and there aren&#039;t any major animation kerfuffles.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Again not really a lot to say. The OP and ED are pretty unmemorable. I tended to skip

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66023">
        past them.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
This is where the series really takes a nosedive. The rule of &quot;status quo is god&quot; seems to be in effect here. The events of one episode tend not to affect the characters in a later episode. With this there is little-to-no character development. The characters seem to be exactly the same, and be acting the exact same way in the first episode as the last episode. I found the supporting characters to be egregious and more than anything annoying, with one exception (the twins). The main characters themselves are extremely annoying. Kouta, the male lead, has very little personality other than the fact that he looks like an elementary student and is extremely passive to the sexual abuse he endures throughout the series. Chizuru is the aggressive and horny 400 year old fox spirit, she spends most of her time obsessing over Kouta, to the point where when she thought she couldn&#039;t be with him sexually she was willing to die. Nozomu is the more passive, and less sexual but still aggressive foil to Chizuru. She spends most of the series playing &quot;raised by wolves&quot; antics, interrupting Chizuru&#039;s &quot;naughty&quot; plans for Kouta at the worst time, and trying to match (and failing) Chizuru&#039;s sexual abuse of Kouta.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
This is where people may differ. If you enjoy ecchi anime then there is the possibility you&#039;ll enjoy Kanokon. However if you&#039;re looking for a series with more than just fanservice then this is likely to disappoint you.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
While I didn&#039;t particularly enjoy this. Others may find this less than not enjoyable. I don&#039;t recommend this for anyone looking for a &quot;good&quot; show to watch. However if you&#039;re a fan of ecchi and fanservice this is just the show for you, and that&#039;s okay.

    Alright. This is going to be my first review here on MAL, but I figured I would get off to a good start. However, I&#039;m rating Kanokon first, so I hope my review doesn&#039;t sound too cynical. Here goes.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s really -no- story to this anime. The only thing I managed to get out of it was a bit of arousal. But I suppose that&#039;s why they call it ecchi. It&#039;s borderline hentai, in my opinion. I think I saw up Chizuru&#039;s skirt over one hundred times. But seriously. It was really pushed to the limit to the point where it wasn&#039;t even entertaining when it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12729">
        happened. The flashing was just too common. Fanservice is nice, but there&#039;s a point where enough is enough. This is definitely NOT a family anime. Hide this. Far away. Out of sight.<br />
<br />
The main character, Kouta, looks like he&#039;s in preschool. Yeah. I said preschool. And his eyes are ridiculously... large... and... and well. Yeah. It&#039;s bothersome. He would have looked better with a bag on his head. And then you have Chizuru who, surprise surprise, falls in love with Kouta. But what would any anime be without the rival? As a result, you then have Nozomu, clinging to Kouta nearly just as much as Chizuru. Throughout this whole anime, you&#039;re probably asking yourself why you&#039;re watching this. I&#039;m surprised I didn&#039;t just toss this halfway through. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m perverted. Yeah, actually, that&#039;s probably it. Oh, did I mention, Chizuru and Nozomu are spirits? Yep. A fox and wolf spirit to be exact. Sounds cool, but it really doesn&#039;t affect the anime too much. My favorite character ended up being Tayura, probably because he was one of the more normal characters. But that&#039;s enough of that. The characters were mediocre at best, and whenever I watched Nozomu, I swear she reminded me of Yuki Nagato from The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya. XP Probably because she was the silent type. OH WELL.<br />
<br />
This anime is one of those things that you&#039;ll end up liking, or end up hating. I&#039;ll give it an award for maintaining an &quot;ecchi&quot; label, even though most of the show, you&#039;re listening to perverted comments, and watching Chizuru push Kouta into her breasts so she can, lol, &quot;spoil him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall, if you&#039;re looking for fanservice, this is it. It&#039;s just so blatant that it&#039;s IMPOSSIBLE to miss. Just don&#039;t expect too much out of this one.

    If Kanokon was real life, we&#039;d live in a world of inverse sexual attraction. Meek little men that look like they&#039;d lose in an armwrestle with a hamster would be getting all the attention from strong overconfident women. I shit you not, the &quot;male lead&quot; here squeals like a weasel and apologises to his deceased grandfather every time girls try to initiate sexual contact with him. I&#039;ve never been so fucking rustled in my entire life. <br />
<br />
The plot... there isn&#039;t any. Just one weak boy that was probably manufactured with a flaccid dick and a horde of one dimensional nymphos. They force themselves on him,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192648">
        he starts looking like a rotten tomato and runs away screaming some shit about his grandfather and how immoral sexual activities are. Rinse and repeat - whole 12 episodes. I had to light up a joint and pretend he&#039;s just playing hard to get to avoid slamming my monitor against the wall every time he went full retard. <br />
<br />
The art was decent however and I imagine this would be the only reason why anyone in their right mind would ever want to watch this perversion of natural selection - ecchi fanservice. There are nicely animated tits and asses in every episode for your viewing pleasure but if that&#039;s all you&#039;re looking for... just look up hentai. Saves you the headache of wading through this apocalyptic disaster of a &quot;plot&quot;. <br />
<br />
The sound &amp; OST were horrid at best. The male lead sounds like a castrated chipmunk with guilt issues and the females squirt over his skinny pale ass like he&#039;s mandingo. The music will make your ears bleed and the OP &amp; ED themes like the ones here have been confirmed to be the cause of erectile dysfunction in young men across the world. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - there is none. This shit will infuriate any man or woman. It doesn&#039;t matter what you believe or where you hail from - this anime is a rape of the natural balance of nature we observe everyday. <br />
<br />
Wasted best bud to try to get through this. I&#039;m being extremely lenient when I give this steaming turd 2 points only on the merit of good art.
