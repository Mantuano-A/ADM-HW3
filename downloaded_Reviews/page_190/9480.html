    You know what I hate about game adaptations? It&#039;s not the final product that&#039;s the anime itself, but the production staff, or more precisely anybody who has the cheek to say that they can prolong these works to something like a 2-cour show (meaning 24 to 26 episodes). Please Japan, even if you won&#039;t listen to the Western fans that we absolutely DO NOT NEED shows like this, at least please consider that making a show is not cheap at all, and you can make-do with another show that will serve your budget better and have a better audience reach.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never even heard of Blue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418125">
        Reflection the video game itself, but based off of Metacritic scores for the original 2017 game, it&#039;s &quot;mixed to average reviews&quot;, but the same could not be said for the anime adaptation, which is a spin-off of the main series. And boy oh boy, I suffered through this hellhole just to make this review to tell you the TL;DR that this show is already doomed for failure from the start. And if the anime Blu-Ray release was cancelled mid-way through the show&#039;s life, you know that the message to completely skip this show is warranted, even if it&#039;s for &quot;various reasons&quot; (it&#039;s clear that it wasn&#039;t popular, geddit?).<br />
<br />
To be clear, magical girl series are a dime a dozen. We&#039;ve seen this with Madoka Magica, Assault Lily and many others like it, but not all of them hold the distinction of being a rip-off imitation of (especially) Madoka Magica and one of my favourite recent underrated masterpiece shows of the modern age, Granbelm. There&#039;s just something about Blue Reflection Ray that kinda divulges from the whole Mahou Shoujo formula, but yet have no staying power because of waning interests that &quot;nothing else is going for it&quot;. Look, like some people who can recognize that this show is good for them, it&#039;s that it tried to be emotionally mature with its setting, and it&#039;s a decent start and ending all things considered, I&#039;ll give it that. But to pad it out in the span of 6 months, man, does this become so tiring and boring to look at. If it was a game that I cared about, I&#039;d not mind if it was that long if the story and plot had some substance to it, but Blue Reflection Ray, unless you played the game before, as an anime-only, your interest is as good as &quot;Dropped&quot; after the 3-episode rule.<br />
<br />
The plot is so barebones; the characters feel like one-toned characters (especially the main female MC Hiori Hirahara because she&#039;s just a walking plot device and nothing more); this is kinda the best of the worst that J.C.Staff (that stands for Just Crap Stuff) could muster without much effort and all; and the music really is the only aspect I&#039;ll call decent from reputable music artistes like EXiNA, Eir Aoi and ACCAMER (especially the 1st Cour OST set I really vibe to it a lot, that set was really good).<br />
<br />
I am not disappointed, it&#039;s kinda to be expected when Japan tries to pump out game adaptations to its own audience, and got the short end of the stick when even the anime fails to capitalize and influence people to the relevant IPs. For the rest of the world, you can pretty much just skip this one, there&#039;re other noteworthy Mahou Shoujo shows that will make your time investment a lot better than this turd.

    Blue Reflection Ray is an anime spinoff for the PS4/PC game Blue Reflection released in 2017. From my understanding none of the main characters (Yuzu and Lime are recurring side characters) and plot points carry over from the game, so it definitely qualifies as a spinoff that uses the concepts from the in-game universe but nothing else. So it should be fine watching this without playing the game. Disclaimer that I actually haven&#039;t played Blue Reflection, so someone who actually has can correct me on this because their opinion will be more valid than mine. <br />
<br />
Getting into reviewing the actual anime, you have already probably

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418162">
        noticed my score is very high for this show. This doesn&#039;t mean that this show is some hidden gem of an underrated masterpiece that I think literally everyone should be able to enjoy, far from it. The rating reflects (haha this guy is funny) my bias that comes from how I interpreted the narrative and plot points of the show. The singular reason why I personally enjoyed Blue Reflection Ray so much is because this show is the closest thing we have to a Kingdom Hearts anime adaptation. Let&#039;s go over the similarities between Blue Reflection Ray and the Kingdom Hearts series.<br />
<br />
-main characters that fight with weapons and powers that are the manifestation of their emotions? check.<br />
-the main conflict of the narrative centers on opposing ideologies on how feelings and emotions should influence relationships with others? check.<br />
-over the top light/darkness motifs that really hammer home how edgy this is? check.<br />
-a grand collective entity of emotions that holds absolute authority over all emotional power? (The Common = Kingdom Hearts) check. <br />
-emotions being used as a resource or catalyst to reach this grand collective entity of emotions? (Fragments = Hearts) check. <br />
-memories being altered, influenced, or erased by being tied to emotions? check.<br />
-the side characters and antagonists are much more interesting and fleshed out than the happy-go-lucky main character who is a walking plot device? check.<br />
-very slow and seemingly nonsensical story that only makes sense as the narrative approaches its conclusion? check.<br />
<br />
This very biased framework was the foundation for how I went about watching this show, and is probably the only reason why I didn&#039;t drop it after a few episodes. Blue Reflection Ray as a standalone show isn&#039;t very impressive. The art, while unique and fluid, is really inconsistent and looks unappealing to the average 2021 seasonal anime consumer; though, I do give props to them for continuing to draw out every scene regardless and not using some ugly ass CG to fill in the gaps. The soundtrack was good but not outstanding compared to shows with higher production value. The characters I thought were really good, but unfortunately the two weakest characters by far are the two main heroines Hiori and Ruka who we are stuck with for like the first few episodes. Only after a while are we properly introduced to the much more interesting antagonists, and Momo and Miyako become more involved in the main narrative. The strength of the cast in this show is their chemistry together and how they organically come to rely on each other like a very big family, but this also does not occur until the second half of the show. There are a lot of yuri undertones in the show, but there is a whole mountain of shows better for that, so people who are here just for lesbians will likely be disappointed. Blue Reflection Ray is a show that takes a long time to ramp up and can appear as slow to most anime consumers. The narrative also doesn&#039;t make much sense which can be frustrating for most anime consumers as well. <br />
<br />
The thing with Kingdom Hearts is that while it is quite popular, it&#039;s a very flawed series. The writer for Kingdom Hearts, Tetsuya Nomura, oftentimes writes stories that are so far-fetched that we can only imagine what he smoked before working on the script. And Kingdom Hearts fans have come to just simply tolerate or even embrace how ridiculous and nonsensical the franchise is. So when watching Blue Reflection Ray, a lot of the downsides of the show like the very slow pacing, the beginning of the show not making any sense, and the two main characters not being nearly as interesting as the other characters, were less like flaws to me than they were features of the show due to its uncanny resemblance to Kingdom Hearts. To get to the heart of things (haha this guy is funny you should really check out his other reviews), that is the main reason why I enjoyed Blue Reflection Ray so much, flaws and all. I ate up Hiori&#039;s monologues about feelings and how precious they are, just like I ate up Sora yelling &quot;Kingdom Hearts is light!&quot; as the light engulfed Ansem. I had blind belief (okay I believe you) that the nonsensical narrative at the start of the show would all come full circle so I could see the whole picture, just like I had blind belief that understanding the story of the Kingdom Hearts mobile game would fill in the all the plot holes in Nomura&#039;s writing. I got hyped over every fight scene where the characters were talking about the weight of their feelings while literally hitting each other with their feelings. I embraced the ridiculous flawed nature of Blue Reflection Ray because it was flawed in just the same way as the Kingdom Hearts series, and I had a blast every single episode. <br />
<br />
So what does this mean for you as the reader? Most likely, nothing. This review isn&#039;t here to change your opinion. If you didn&#039;t like Blue Reflection Ray, then it means you probably will hate Kingdom Hearts as well. However, if you are an avid Kingdom Hearts fan, then I&#039;d very much so recommend giving Blue Reflection Ray a watch. Vice versa, if you liked watching Blue Reflection Ray, then you would probably really enjoy playing through the Kingdom Hearts series. Thanks for reading.

    Blue Reflection Ray, Tie and Sun are sequels for the game titled BLUE REFLECTION released in 2017. I&#039;ve completed the game and love it very much. I can&#039;t review the game here even though I would like to, but do give the game a try. It has LIT ASS music and beautiful art designs. <br />
For those who never played the game, Ray is a separate story and setting from the original game so, plot-wise, you won&#039;t be missing anything. However, Ray so far rarely explains the mechanics of Blue Reflection, so it can be slightly mind boggling. <br />
For fellow cultured people who&#039;ve played the game,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399938">
        Ray has a few new things to offer. It doesn&#039;t have Hayato Asano&#039;s LIT ASS music though, that&#039;s the only letdown. On the bright side, he must be working on the upcoming BR games. <br />
<br />
Ray&#039;s art and animation is consistent for the first few episodes, then starts to slack off and melt later like most anime. There are just a few nice scenes with gorgeous background or fluid action. Half of the action scenes&#039; animations are either wacky or subpar. Art is fair 6/10.<br />
<br />
You like bass? The guy who worked in Fate/Apo, which featured bunch of ear-raping bass(I liked them a lot), continues to bring those bass to other works. Luckily, he has toned it down to acceptable levels due to complaints of ear damage. On the other hand, I don&#039;t know who composes the music, it&#039;s definitely not LIT ASS like the game, it&#039;s still okay. Voice actresses are all non-mainstream and refreshing to hear. Sound is good 7/10. <br />
<br />
Characters are well done in Blue Reflection Ray. Within 8 episodes, almost all characters received balanced exposure and the main characters have developed smoothly. The best part of Blue Reflection is how organic it treats drama, there&#039;s no huge motivational speech to inspire the damsel in distress, there is only a quiet support and words of comfort to cheer you on. That is a much more believable and reliable approach, even in real life. Ya, the girl-girl wholesomeness is great too. Characters are outstanding ten per ten!<br />
<br />
Story is progressing on a steady pace for me. I was expecting a lot more SoL CGDCT content but the girls are surprisingly busy. I think the plot is quite simple and predictable so far and should only rate a bleh 5/10 but there is an excellent character backstory so... Story 8/10.<br />
<br />
As a fan of Blue Reflection, I enjoyed Ray a lot. Ray offered a lot more depth in characters than the original game could, and isn&#039;t afraid to spice things up with a little edginess. Unfortunately, if I have to rate this anime objectively, it gets a normal 6, pulled down by its subpar art and animation. Overall, a biased 8/10.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m Reviewholic. My favorite Blue Reflection OST are Vesicular Membrane Transporter and DNF FW15C (yes it&#039;s an actual track name).

    Recommendation: A strong mahou shoujo series if you can get past the terrible animation.  The anime is standalone, it&#039;s neither an adaptation nor a sequel to the video game Blue Reflection, and features only a handful of characters from the game.<br />
<br />
Story: A pair of magical girls called Reflectors, Ruka and Hiori, fight to protect other girls from a group of predatory Reflectors that try to steal their Fragments (analogous to a person&#039;s emotions or soul, they become emotionally dead and zombie like, and later fall into a coma without it).  The story takes some wild turns (which I won&#039;t spoil) building off that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418154">
        premise, and ends up in a radically different place than where it starts.  It&#039;s certainly never boring, though occasionally it gets a bit too convoluted or abstract to follow exactly what&#039;s happening.  Tone wise, it&#039;s squarely in the camp of &quot;dark mahou shoujo&quot;, though it isn&#039;t excessive about it.  It deals with some very heavy issues though, including child abuse, abandonment, suicide, self-harm and teenage prostitution.  Listing all those off in a row makes it sound more depressing than it actually is though.  The series doesn&#039;t wallow in despair or revel in the suffering of its characters.  It&#039;s actually a pretty positive series overall, even a bit corny.<br />
<br />
Audio/Visual: This show has a phenomenal OST, it adds so much to the series.  Battles feel more epic, tragic moments hit harder, and moments of triumph give you chills.  It is everything you would want from a soundtrack.  The VA work is solid but not notable for the most part.<br />
<br />
Then, we have the elephant in the room.  Frankly speaking, this show looks awful.  It isn&#039;t even the often-lampooned character designs, those simply have a shoujo manga look that&#039;s different than what you&#039;d expect but not bad in and of itself.  The animation is absolutely atrocious though.  Characters are frequently off model, have eyes pointing in different directions, and have some of the most poorly drawn hands you&#039;ll ever see in anime.  Aside from the battle scenes, which actually have some cool effects at times, and the nice, unique looking backgrounds of the Leap Range and the Common, there is almost nothing positive you can say about the series visually.  It&#039;s a major letdown that a series this good was failed by its animation so horrendously<br />
<br />
Characters: This series has excellent character writing and a wide variety of interesting characters with unique personalities.  Ruka&#039;s character progression is very well done in particular, as she goes from a shy girl with no friends to a crucial voice of reason and motivator of the group.  Hiori&#039;s initially generic &quot;genki girl&quot; attitude is also memorably subverted during the second cour.  The side characters are complex and each have their own roles to play, and no one is extraneous.  With so many things stacked against this series (the low budget, video game adaptation, etc...) it&#039;s kind of a miracle that it ended up being good, and the excellent characters are the main reason for that.<br />
<br />
As a final note, this series has a lot of content warnings associated with it, as mentioned above, but there is a particularly extreme sequence of child abuse in episode 22 that most viewers will probably find troubling, especially those that are sensitive to that issue.

    I do feel that this show has gotten kinda of a bad rap, especially by people who write 1/10 reviews for attention and publish them the moment a show ends in Japan before subs are even out. But Blue Reflection Ray has been a rather captivating, if flawed experience that actually made me interested in the greater franchise.<br />
<br />
Full disclosure, I never played the original game, and without knowing the show is actually a sequel to the game&#039;s events and it fully expecting you to understand the plot of the first game, I didn&#039;t have a good time the first time through. After reading and watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418212">
        a quick synopsis though, I began to appreciate the show more. The animation is lousy, and unlike Sonny Boy it doesn&#039;t have much of a cinematic flair to it to compensate for it. But perhaps because of that, I ended up appreciating the plot and characters a lot more. <br />
<br />
The show does feel quite aimless in the first half, up until the 10th or so episode I wasn&#039;t actively engaged; but come the second half, the show starts becoming a lot more focused in the story it&#039;s trying to tell, and by then I was hooked until the very end. Up to the point where I&#039;m even seriously considering to get Tie to see where it all continues. Hiori and Ruka are really cute as leads and I do like the charm their social awkwardness adds to the show. I will say that the show does have one of my personal pet peeves, with abuse victims being main antagonists. It&#039;s not depicted that well here too, with it basically giving a lousy justification to Shino&#039;s actions. But aside from that, the core cast is still likable enough through and through.<br />
<br />
It is a shame the Blu Rays were cancelled for this. I think maybe giving the show more polish can help in its presentation, but hey at the very least, the show did its job in convincing at least one other person out there in the world to give the series a proper shot. <br />
<br />
6/10

    I&#039;m not huge on magical girl animes, but this one however is different I love this anime so much I know it doesn&#039;t have the best ratings and it&#039;s not a popular anime. But I really love this anime a lot and I don&#039;t know why. But this anime is really enjoyable it may be a bit boring at the start but it gets better the more you watch and on top this anime has hints/elements of wlw in this show so just know that. But over all very good I&#039;m sad we only get like two weeks left until the anime is completed. It&#039;s

    I tend to stay away from the MAL page of show&#039;s I&#039;m in the middle of. I don&#039;t like seeing ratings until I&#039;ve seen a whole work and have come to my own conclusions about its quality. This might be the lowest rated show (in terms of its site-wide rating) that I&#039;ve reviewed, and I find that absolutely baffling. Because I found this so, so surprising, and while it&#039;s far from perfect, I think it&#039;s so much better than its rating suggests.<br />
<br />
Getting the bad out of the way, I imagine a lot of the low rating is its animation which is, to be clear, definitely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419502">
        rough. I think I see what they were going for with the art style, and I really like the watercolour stylisation that a lot of its characters and settings has. But, to be really generous, the actual character animation is... it&#039;s not great. Things tend to improve a little in action scenes, but even then, JC Staff is capable of far better than this (I&#039;m a particularly big fan of &quot;A Certain Scientific Railgun&quot;, and this is nowhere close). My opinions on the animation sort of align with what I wrote about &quot;Farewell, My Dear Cramer&quot;, it&#039;s a similar state to that.<br />
<br />
But, if you can get past that, there is an awful lot to love about this show. <br />
<br />
When we see &#039;dark&#039; Magical Girl shows, they seem to pretty consistently swing towards being edgy, violent, and depressing. What&#039;s refreshing about this is that, with this show, we&#039;ve got a Magical Girl show that doesn&#039;t just want to be edgy nonsense, but to actually tell a darker, slightly more thematically interesting story than its kids show roots. Here, that means a fairly interesting, if imperfect, exploration of what it means to feel, of the importance of feelings, positive or negative, and does so through an emotionally resonant story, with a conclusion that feels like it holds to those ideas. It&#039;s not perfect, of course; a couple of the more specific aspects of mental health it explores could perhaps have done with a little tweaking, and while it does work surprisingly well, the main antagonist&#039;s backstory, when we learn it, is utterly buck-wild, and is the only time where the show does slip a little into those edgy places. It just about makes it work, but it also feels a little dissonant with the rest of the story. The show&#039;s full of tragic stories, sure, but they largely tend to feel mostly grounded and believable, which this last story just doesn&#039;t quite manage to.<br />
<br />
The characters tend to be where the show hits its stride the most. It&#039;s a reasonably big cast, that grows a lot over the course, but pretty much all of them manage to feel well-crafted and get at least some development over the course of the show. That development really is the core of the story, which makes sense given the thematic emphasis on characters&#039; emotions, so watching different characters come to term with their pasts and embrace the feelings that make them who they are has a lot of weight to it. The two core protagonists, Hiori and Ruka, naturally get a lot of this, although Hiori probably fits most closely into the main protagonist role; a good choice, in my opinion. While Ruka definitely has a lot interesting about her, and is definitely an invaluable part of the show, it&#039;s Hiori has both the go-getting, optimistic attitude to make you root for her and the more complex emotional life needed to make her the central part of a story like this. Outside of those two, the cast is interesting and likeable, with only one or two important characters feeling a little left behind where development is concerned. It&#039;s a very character-driven show, so those characters need to be ones you care about, and this does the job well.<br />
<br />
Overall, despite the rough animation, I really did enjoy this show a lot. I liked the characters, found the world-building compelling enough to keep my attention, and found the whole thing really thematically interesting, pulling just enough twists to keep me on my toes, and ultimately giving me an ending I can&#039;t be dissatisfied with. Definitely more successes than failures, at least in my book.

    This plot is decent, but it feels like it was stretched out too much. The start was also sub-optimal, as it was unclear what the story was even about until almost half the show had passed. The second half was an improvement, primarily because I actually knew what was happening. The series also has some decent slice of life episodes. <br />
<br />
As for the ending, it was actually pretty good, the only disappointment being that the epilogue felt really rushed, and a few things were left unclear, presumably to promote the game. <br />
<br />
The audio is amazing in most cases, with the op&#039;s and ed&#039;d being some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418284">
        of my favorites of the season. Character design, while unusual, was also pretty nice, and their personalities were also fleshed out, and weren&#039;t 2 dimensional.<br />
<br />
But the excessively slow start of the show is why I cant give it more than 6 stars, since it will probably kill most people&#039;s desire to continue to watch the show.

    This has to be one of the worst series I&#039;ve watched in a good while. I&#039;d have dropped it, but I thought &quot;It&#039;ll improve!&quot;, in fact the first handful of episodes were pretty good, visually it stood out from other magical girl shows and it seemed like this would be a hit. It just falls into mediocrity however, leaving you to not care about the plot or characters ultimately. <br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give them credit where it&#039;s clearly due. They try to present an emotionally mature story, but they fail to that, rather this &quot;emotionally mature story&quot; is just boring.  Evil Magical Girls is a trope

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418183">
        not done very often and I had so hoped this would have been interesting, but instead it just leads me to wonder how anyone thought this series needed to happen. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation wise it looks like they cheaped out after the first handful of episodes. What started as an interesting look at the genre I enjoy so much, has ended becoming one of the worst looking shows of the season I feel. Maybe I need to have played the games to know what&#039;s going on, maybe I just need to pay more attention, but one thing is certain, this is just boring. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re wondering &quot;Is this worth my time?&quot; it&#039;s not, it&#039;s incredibly skippable and you would be better off doing such. Go watch Precure or something, if you want magical girl, or the new season of Magia Record, at least you won&#039;t wind up disappointed by what you watched.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upon viewing the finale, I&#039;ve asked myself &quot;Why did I watch this awful series?&quot; And I don&#039;t know. The animation didn&#039;t hold up, it looked sloppy at many points. The characters themselves had no real motivations, they were just there to have depressing things happen. There&#039;s no payoff, there&#039;s no villain, it&#039;s just all sadness. Maybe the game is better, but I don&#039;t even know if this has anything to do with the game. It ultimately doesn&#039;t matter, as if this is what&#039;s meant to represent the game, I&#039;ll avoid it at all costs.

    This anime feels like there&#039;s no passion put into it. Just about everything is lacking. From the plot, to the characters, to the animation... It&#039;s pretty much just a half-baked made anime. I won&#039;t even be surprised if this anime was made by a bunch of high school students as a side-project.<br />
<br />
I feel like there&#039;s something that happened while watching this anime, but I don&#039;t remember. I sometimes think to myself whether I actually watched this anime everyweek since the only things I remember from this anime is &quot;Onee-sama&quot; or &quot;Onee-chan&quot; or pretty much just yuri-bait.<br />
Well, even though I said all of these things, there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418182">
        are some things that I liked from this anime. The music is good. Oh wait, that&#039;s only one thing lmao<br />
<br />
Welp, overall, it&#039;s okay. Probably? lol<br />

    I saw other reviews claiming that they had never played the game, so here&#039;s a review from someone who spent way too much time on that game. Long story short, that game was terrible too, but my review will contain several cross-references to that game, so ignore this if you will ever consider playing it. (pretty unlikely even the state of this show)<br />
<br />
Blue Reflection as a series is intended to reflect the personal growths between youthful women and their various emotional interactions. In simple terms, a Mahou Shoujo focusing more on the SOL part. This is heavily defined between the numerous interactions between the game&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418398">
        protagonist and the various other collectable female friends you are supposed to make in the game. The conclusion one should achieve after the Blue Reflection game is probably to re-appreciate the peaceful youthful times of our school lives. <br />
<br />
Quoted exactly from Wikipedia, The developers describe the game as a &quot;heroic RPG&quot; that serves as a &quot;life-sized&quot; portrayal of youth for women, themed around &quot;human essence&quot; and connections between people. The central concept is interaction between women, with the player character growing as a person through experiences she shares with her classmates, such as the beginnings and endings of friendships.<br />
<br />
So with this kind of experience, we should naturally expect the same kind of thing from the animated series? Except no.<br />
<br />
The anime starts off strong, clearly defining several Reflectors, both good and bad Reflectors. The show drags on with episodic clashes between both parties. Protagonists keep finding excuses to suddenly be stronger. And almost nothing is achieved or resolved in the show, except for several girls constantly prancing around in cosplay throughout the series. In the end, I was completely left disappointed. Every episode feels pointless, and almost nothing is resolved or concluded. You will constantly be left wondering, why is this something happening, and what is this even? The show&#039;s plot is completely based as an indirect sequel to the game, so the show references it occasionally, WITHOUT CONTEXT. A great example is the monster (Sephiroth) shown trying to attack the Reflectors, and the show easily concludes without any explanation or whatsoever about it. Lime and Yuzu, two major characters from the game, make direct appearances in the show without adopting any sort of role or purpose, which would be fine if it was just a mere cameo. Instead, they reprise their newfound roles (which is a major spoiler for the game) in the show, and still achieve nothing. There are several more references in the show to the game, and the timing + relevancies of these cameos are so disappointing and pointless. <br />
In the end, I suspect there was some sort of a grand plot. Every character eventually has their background revealed, and their motivations within the show. However, the studio has wonderfully collapsed any sort of resemblance towards the concept, and often has their characters doing pointless dumb things like running errands and making unkept promises. I also found it really dumb how they had characters like Nina constantly quote some irrelevant nonsense over and over again.<br />
If you want to understand anything about the show, you absolutely need context from the base game. Then you can watch this, and you can change your confusion into just disappointment.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s art and theming? Completely destroyed. In the original game, Mel Kishida, the character designer perfectly captured the essence of &quot;beautiful girls&quot; with his doll-like style and a strongly themed vision. The game straddles between an anime-styled approach and real-life visuals to deliver on its promise of an enjoyable experience.<br />
In the anime, Mel Kishida is still the character designer. Only this time, his signature art style has been completely defaced, and the &quot;youthful beautiful girls&quot; theme has been disregarded. The characters now look like something a 12 year old kid would draw. In fact, Mel Kishida constantly posts his interpretations of the anime character designs on his twitter, so you might want to compare both anime and his concepts, just to see how the show butchered his art. <br />
So why are the characters so low-quality now? I suspected it was impossible to replicate Mel&#039;s designs onto the animated screen, and that they were redirecting the focus to that, but I was wronged again. The animation, which promised Mahou Shoujo INTERACTIONS, turned out to be episodic 5 minute fights between both good and evil parties. And the common conclusion was nobody won or lost. The animation is choppy to say at best, and the camera angles could easily be positioned better. The Common, a really beautiful place in the game, feels super slimy in the anime, how did they even achieve that??? <br />
Remember when I said there were occasional references to the game? It was difficult to pinpoint several references, given the art&#039;s slimy feel, and the bastardized conceptual arts of locations within the city.<br />
What could have easily turned out to be one of the most beautiful animes of the year has been defiled into a low-tier mahou shoujo clone. If I were Mel Kishida I would sue this studio.<br />
<br />
Blue Reflection easily claims the top spot in my list for boasting perfect JRPG music. The game studio GUST is famous for developing such masterpieces, and Hayano Asato has perfectly encapsulated the feeling of a &quot;youthful summer feel&quot; within the game, as well as the various &quot;emotion&quot; themes littered throughout the game. I would absolutely recommend you to listen to it.<br />
In the anime, the studio has picked Daisuke Shinoda instead. Shinoda has chosen to use more orchestral-like music to fit the scene, which should pair nicely with the Mahou Shoujo fights. Instead, as the fights are extremely lacking, the music is left hanging to develop some sort of ominous atmosphere with a small tinge of hope. The music constantly feels misplaced, with some areas not having any music at all. And the biggest atrocity of all? Absolutely zero references to Hayano Asato&#039;s music. The expected feeling of a youthful summer feel has been transformed into a bleak future with little hope.<br />
The sound effects are atrocious to listen to as well, especially whenever any girls fall into despair, I would instinctively brace my ears.<br />
As a GUST adaptation, music should be the number 1 priority, as it is their biggest selling point. Completely shafting Hayano Asato is a crime, and they have paid for it with terrible music placements.<br />
As a side note, I am just saying, Shinoda has done way better in other animes, but this fault probably lies in the studio&#039;s incompetency.<br />
<br />
Character wise, there is not much to talk about. Mel Kishida has done a wonderful job of designing these characters, and their unique quirks, traits and background. The anime has efficiently crumpled his efforts into a jumble of trash, with characters barely developing. Girls falling into despair is not a new thing, but it is a guilty pleasure for many. The anime exceeds beyond at this point, to making you, the viewer, fall into despair with its terrible animations.<br />
<br />
I really love the game. but even I knew the game was bad enough to be shafted one side for eternity. Therefore I was extremely excited when I saw a possible standalone adaptation of this series. Fully expecting the worst (due to the simplicity of the original game), my low standards were easily devastated from this adaptation. Bad animation, bad music, the list goes on. However, this anime has one singular silver lining, and that was showing me this series is not dead. A sequel to the game, Blue Reflection Tie, will come out soon and it invites several characters from this show into it. <br />
<br />
Blue Reflection Ray is a masterpiece in disappointing. There are not enough words to express the rage and sorrow I feel from my favorite game being obliterated like so. However, if you want the full Blue Reflection experience, you absolutely must sit through 24 episodes of agonizing void to feed on the tiny crumbs of lore this show provides for the Blue Reflection Multiverse.<br />
<br />
I have not logged in MAL for years. I just had to let my anger be heard somewhere else. I hope you guys understand my perspective and understood any part of my &quot;review&quot;.<br />
