    In the writing of this review, I noticed one big problem, spoilers. As you can probably guess from my rating of this show there is a whole lot going on here and there is so much more of it than what one would expect at first glance. The issue is, it’s hard to convey all of that without going into what happens later on. And so what I can do is tell you what I think this show does well, while sometimes the why will be somewhat obscured, I will do my best to convey what I can. The main thing that you should know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265712">
        is that Urahara manages to do a whole lot of amazing things.<br />
<br />
One of the unique things about fiction is it’s ability to connect to people. There is something powerful about stories that not just remind us of our own lives but those that can add even more meaning to them, or present something in a way that just facts can’t. When one looks through people’s favorite anime it’s usually filled with all sorts of anime that have reached out to the viewer in question, at least in some way. While it’s not the hallmark of a good anime, it’s a very good trait for a show to be able to do that.<br />
<br />
Urahara is a show about young creatives in every sense of the word. It’s not just that the characters are young artists themselves but rather that the whole series is filled up with style and creativity that matches up with the subject matter they’re talking about. Every part of the show connects to the two main themes of the show and their representation. To say why they are so brilliant, it needs to be understood why they are that way, and how it reflects on the subject matter and themes of the work.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with the art and the animation. The best way to describe the art of the show is by stating that it’s aesthetic. So very aesthetic. While the animation itself can be simple and lacking at times, the background is almost always detailed and filled with all sorts of random items that may or may not fit in naturally. Things like floating sweets and random tanukis sometimes make up the backdrop. And then there is all of the color. There is never a dull frame in the show as pretty much every frame is a colorgasm with each object radiating its own color. Frequently lines aren’t connected together but rather are loosely drawn close enough. <br />
<br />
Each person will react to that differently. aesthetic for the most part is a matter of taste. While some won’t enjoy the chaoticness of the screen and its focus on colors rather than animation there are others like me, who love the aesthetic. But the brilliance of it isn’t related to whether I like it or whether someone else doesn’t but rather how it’s able to relate to its themes. First off it perfectly melds in with the setting. Harajuku is the capital of kawaii and creativity in Japan. There people who dress up in all sorts of wild and interesting styles in order to carve out something unique. Which is exactly what Urahara does with its art. Whether one likes it or not it’s hard to deny that there is no anime that looks exactly like Urahara. Furthermore, lots of kawaii art features the same sort of ideas: lots of colors, lots of random cute items, a cute cluttered mess. I remember looking through various kawaii art books in stores and often there was a common trend of filling up the page with all sorts of random colorful items. So in a city that is focused on that kawaii aesthetic, that is colorful and norm-breaking itself, Urahara lives up to that with its own unique artistic style. Not only carving out its own niche but also in representing its subject matter in a way most anime couldn’t even dream of.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not just the art that is able to live out its themes but it’s also the story that connects well with its themes. On its face, it’s a simple story about some girls who try to defend the place that they love. Which is fine but doesn’t look notable. That is until one looks at what that means and how that relates to the story as a whole. Urahara is just as much about these girls protecting the place they love, as it is about creators protecting their creations and their imagination from the pressures of those outsiders. <br />
<br />
This is further proven by the enemy that they face, the scoopers. They’re basically aliens that only know how to steal. They can’t create and so they steal the works of others to use as their own. This basically goes into one of the issues of being a creative. Especially if someone wants to be able to profit from their works. When art becomes a business there is a lot of murky details that get added into the discussion. The artist isn’t allowed to just do what they want but rather they have to live up to what the audience wants or else they won’t be able to get profits and they’ll fade into obscurity broke. The mirror, in this case, is the scoopers are the consumers while the three girls are the creators. Consumers are interested in nice things that they can take and enjoy. The artist’s intent and thoughts behind it no longer matter as much. Each consumer is going to use the product in a different way, and have different thoughts about it. In a sense, publishing one’s work is also letting one’s work be stolen. If one were to keep it to themselves it would be theirs and only theirs forever, but once it floats into the public it’s no longer that simple.<br />
<br />
This cuts into one of the core issues that the girls have to deal with. The difference between doing what they want and doing things for attention. In a perfect world one would be able to have both, but sadly this isn’t a perfect world. One can either do what they want and get nowhere or do what other’s want and be successful. Trust me, this is a pretty significant problem in the art community. Any artist who does both fanwork and Original Creation drawings will know this. While the fanworks is usually drenched with praise and love, the Original Creations are often ignored. People want to see what they like. It’s understandable but it puts the content creators in an interesting position. Do they compromise themselves to please others or do they go with their heart? The girls have this issue throughout the show and face it in multiple ways.<br />
<br />
The characters too face the issues of creators and each represents multiple parts of creation and what is needed for it. One of the brilliant parts of the characters is their ability to not just be good characters with flaws and pros, but also to be examples of both main themes of Urahara. With regards to Urahara’s musing on creating each of the girls represents a different part of creation. They each have different skills whether it be social skills, knowledge, or pure creative talent that makes them a good unit together. But more incredible than that is how accurately they are able to represent the young creative lifestyle.<br />
<br />
First off the character designs do this well. They are quite varied and show the unique personality of each of the girls in what they wear and look like. The accessories, like the cat ears and tail, and oni horns may seem out of place, but this is the land of Harajuku were weird creative things exist. Furthermore, on the internet, I have often seen creatives using sonas as a representation of themselves rather than using something &quot;truer&quot; to themselves. I feel like this is what the designs of Rito and Kotoko are. Representations of themselves based off of their imaginations. It fits with the characters they are and the scene that they’re in.<br />
<br />
Second, the interactions between the girls and their character traits also show this well. Often times they’ll do weird things or just do whatever they feel like just because they want to do it. This is best shown in the first episode when Rito decides to meow like a cat in order to get a cat&#039;s attention. It’s a bit weird, but it’s something that I’d expect. In fact, one of the most amazing things about these characters its how real they feel to me. Especially Rito. They remind me of various people I’ve observed in the past. As well as their bonds. There’s this rapport in creative groups, and often times there is a pattern of collaboration of support that is gotten from them. They become close friends and with that comes encouragement and the desire to see them succeed. The way the characters interact feels very genuine like they really do care about each other from the bottom of their hearts. When things go well they’re willing to lay it all down for each other and help what they can. This too reminds me of how I’ve seen others act. However even with all of this niceness that doesn’t stop them from having issues. All three of them have issues that lie underneath the character. These issues are explored adeptly and show what sort of problems can arise from this creative struggle. The path of a creative is a hard one. What is success? What is good enough. It&#039;s not like other paths where there can be one simple answer. It&#039;s murky, and with murkiness, there&#039;s so many opportunities for something to look off. And those things are the sources of their issues. The anime does a very good job of painting a complete picture of who these girls are. <br />
<br />
All in all, Urahara is a complete package. Not only does it have good characters that are great to root for, but it has a strong compelling story that not only stands as being entertaining but also has a lot of value with the message of the show. Added to that it’s unique art style and the aspects of the young creative’s life that are rarely touched upon so well. There’s a lot here. Every idea in this anime was well thought out. It’s all on purpose. The characters, the art, the sound, the story, they all come together to tell a compelling story, muse on its themes, and be relatable. At the end of the day that’s what it was to me. A show that was able to show the struggles of being a creative, and most importantly being a young creative. I felt many of the struggles they went through. I could relate to them all. And it felt so much like times I’ve spent before. It feels nostalgic in so many different ways. As I said from the start, one of the amazing things about fiction is it’s ability to connect to people. And this show most certainly connected to me. And while it did that, it also got me to love the characters, the setting, the style, and everything about it. I don’t know how it was able to capture all of this so well, while also providing meaning, but I am in awe. I don’t know if I’d label it a masterpiece but it’s pretty dang close to one. But I can say for sure that this is one of my absolute favorite shows, and for me well deserving of a 10.

    Note: This review contains minor spoilers.<br />
<br />
Urahara is a highly entertaining joyride rich in craze and color. However, its inexperienced staff fails to blend its creative concepts in a cohesive fashion.<br />
<br />
Set in Harajuku, the show does a great job at adopting the district’s zany culture. It celebrates art and creativity, both of which are sought after by the Scoopers - the alien invaders threatening to steal all of Earth’s culture and creativity. What initially seems like trivial tale of weekly mahou shoujo-esque monster-of-the-week turns out to be a commentary on what constitutes creativity and the relation of artist and popularity. The transition between the two may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265714">
        have been aptly foreshadowed, but still ends up feeling rushed and jarring; the second half puts a nice bow on the show as a whole, but the surprisingly cruel twists end up clashing with its overall silliness.<br />
<br />
However, that is not to say that the show doesn’t stay entertaining at all times. <br />
The monster-of-the-week format of the first half is carried by its short and simple, but smart fights. Enemies are first examined and their weak points determined, the main trio then acts accordingly. Be it abusing a certain vulnerable time frame, luring a horde scattered throughout the town to one place, or just simple combat techniques - the diverse Scoopers and the great coordination of the protagonists makes the fights wholly enjoyable.<br />
The messier second half on the other hand is mostly carried by the great foreshadowing of the first few episodes. Hidden in plain sight, it’s easy to miss these hints, but they serve as the cornerstones necessary to hold the plot together:<br />
<br />
The inhabitants of Harajuku are shown fleeing from the district; until the bubble surrounding the city due to the girl’s wish appears, there are no people in sight. When the people then showing up in the city are first shown, they are depicted as shadows - not as people.<br />
<br />
Episode 1 first shows the key plot twist without any context - we are then introduced to the colorful culture of Harajuku. <br />
However, the paneling and camerawork suggests that what is shown on screen is actually the view of a rather important onlooker. <br />
The clownish nature of Park’s peculiar visitor also reminds of another character introduced just a few minutes later. <br />
Through these subtle hints, which at first seem rather irksome than meaningful, the later plot is already laid out in the first handful minutes of the show’s runtime.<br />
<br />
Sadly, this subtleness isn’t at all present in the rest of the show. Rather, it often resorts to indiscreet infodump dialogue to e.g. characterize its protagonists. However, there are moments when these introduced character traits are used to great effect, especially pertaining Mari’s anxieties. <br />
<br />
Therein lies one of Urahara’s major strengths: in the second half, the character’s minor traits and weaknesses are exposed and exploited while serving as cornerstone for the parallel narrative of artist and popularity. While initially the protagonist trio seems unassumingly simple, they are actually a lot more nuanced than they are made out to be.<br />
The calm and caring Rito first followed her gut feeling; she drew what she felt like drawing. But her art isn’t praised or recognized like other’s is and thus she grows frustrated. However, when Mari and Kotoko praise her art and she is granted the opportunity to sell her art and be recognized, she grows dependant on the two and their praise.<br />
On the contrary, Mari has copied other people’s art; she follows trends and copies the vogue - and she gets praised for it. She also grows dependent on praise and popularity, but wishes to keep up her appearance as self-confident designer, which results in ever-growing anxiety and her eventually being broken by the illusion of losing her followers.<br />
Kotoko’s curiosity, often highlighted through cat-like appearance, led to others being annoyed and disgusted by her urge to discover. Unable to suppress or express her curiosity, she grows insecure about annoying or talking to other people. She also ends up finding solace in and depending on their group of three.<br />
<br />
The visual style of Urahara oozes creativity; it uses tablecloth as backgrounds and highly-saturized candy colors which paired with the usage of panels instead of new cuts create a colorful and delightful experience. It’s designs are a sight to behold: be it casual clothing, battle suits, Scoopers or Harajuku itself - they are diverse and use a huge repertoire of animation and coloring techniques to underline important characteristics and create an amazing visual experience. <br />
Unfortunately, whatever excitement might stem from its gorgeous designs, Urahara is often sparingly animated - at times even lazily so. During important scenes in the second half, the lackluster animation completely ruins all immersion and dampens what should have been the show’s high point.<br />
<br />
But it is not only during the dramatic scenes that Urahara fails - the music and sound effects are mediocre and straight-up misplaced all the way throughout the show. It restricts itself to generic gleaming sounds and uses dramatic orchestral music when the scenes themselves actually aren’t tense at all. Because of this, the actually tense scenes, playing these very same tracks, feel less special and not as emphasized as they should have been.<br />
<br />
Urahara may stumble along the way, but remains an enjoyable watch. However, it is a niche show in a niche medium and as such I only recommend watching if you can look past its childish and amateurish presentation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Score: 60<br />

    I honestly have no idea why I stuck on watching this, knowing that the 3 episode guideline has already broke down since Episode 1, and am feeling like now&#039;s a good time to drop this travesty of an abomination.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Have you watched Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation? (Spring 2017 season)<br />
<br />
Take that, add the CGDCT moe factor with the sugar, spice and everything nice, you&#039;ll get Urahara. One obvious thing to get out of the way, there is ABSOLUTELY no originality towards the storytelling (well, aside from what the creators intend to do anyways).<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Moe girls? Check.<br />
Insane amounts of food just to get their attention? Check.<br />
Having a fried ebi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261684">
        as your Master? Check.<br />
BUT YET, somehow the characters are easy but also difficult to understand at the same time. Unappealing (don&#039;t say appalling) and uninteresting, nothing much to say about the cast.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
If there&#039;s a good thing about this show, EMT Squared has envisioned the help of the studio Shirogumi with its art and visual designs to help along with the animation, and I gotta say that the environment of Harajuku is made within a 3D space that looks lush and watchable. Even during boss fights with the Scoopers, when they burst after defeat, candy starts to form from the waste, so you know where the focus lies in its attention to detail.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OST ends up being decent at best (aside from the cheesy OP which is by far the best for the show), and they were made like &quot;you know, we have to input this to get our desired result&quot; and such nonsense.<br />
<br />
Verdict (after Ep 4):<br />
Need I say more? Even with the good looking art and decent sound, the story just outright EPIC FAILs for me, because what I got out of this show is nothing but the feeling of watching another clone Akiba&#039;s Trip (of which the former was WAY better), and just wasting close to an hour&#039;s time watching this and catching up with other promising shows this season.<br />
<br />
AVOID IT, PASS IT UP.

    Creativity is a weird thing, but why do we even make art? Is it simply the strive to be original and make something that doesn&#039;t exist? Is it a showcase of our talents? Is it something we do to make others happy? Maybe it&#039;s just a way of expressing ourselves.  But one thing many artists have in common is their emotional connection to their work; the anxiety and self-doubt that comes when that thing you made didn&#039;t come as good as you hoped or when you spend a long time on something only for nobody to notice it, but also the sense of accomplishment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265732">
        and fulfilment when you make something you&#039;re really proud of.  Maybe you&#039;re too hard on yourself and are never happy with your work, or maybe you just love creating regardless of what the end product comes out looking like.<br />
<br />
Urahara felt to me like an expression of that creative process. It&#039;s a show which itself is amateurish in many ways, but which has that underlying charm to it and passion behind it that made me respect and enjoy it much more than I ever thought I would. If you try to judge this show from a purely technical standpoint, you&#039;d probably conclude it&#039;s not that good; The art style is rough and the animation is anything but fluid. It looks low-budget, and it may very well be low-budget, but I feel like from a design standpoint, it absolutely works. It&#039;s an aesthetic that works wonderfully with with the premise, themes and messages within Urahara, specifically the positive view it has on the process of creating art as means of expression rather than as a laborious process to achieve a high technical standard for other people to consume.<br />
<br />
This is a stylish and eccentric and fairly abstract show which takes a ton of risks, many of which I felt absolutely paid off.  It&#039;s one of the most unusual and experimental anime I&#039;ve seen in quite a while and I couldn&#039;t help but tune in every week to watch another episode. It&#039;s a show that leans much more on its general themes, light-hearted aesthetic and charming, relateable characters than on trying to tell any kind of complex story.  If that sounds like your thing, you should definitely give this rather bizarre and colourful show a chance.

    Expressing yourself can be difficult. There is the chance that nobody will notice your expressions or the chance that somebody might be irritated by them. Everybody has a different experience, but these moments of self-expression allow one&#039;s creativity to come through. Even if you are inspired by others, the end product is something that is unique to you. In Urahara, the idea of creativity is explored through three girls in Harajuku.<br />
<br />
The anime starts off with an episodic format where the PARK girls encounter Scoopers and then proceed to take them out by using the amatsumara – items that are the physical embodiment of imagination. In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265768">
        the beginning half of the anime, there is a slow buildup of the plot. There is no set direction as to where the story will go from here, and the audience is stuck with cute girls fighting cute aliens for the time being. It comes off as repetitive and uninspired. However, as the second half of the anime comes in, we are given glimpses into the true nature of the mysterious Misa and the Scoopers. A new threat is revealed and explained, and the girls must try and fight against it. This half of the anime also provides more insight into the characters; it gives them more characterization by showing their flaws, troubles, and backstories. Although the latter half of the anime offers a more concrete threat and other important issues, there are moments here that are prolonged and seem to drag on. The girls&#039; reactions can especially test one&#039;s patience – which can be annoying at times.<br />
<br />
The PARK girls each have their own trope and assigned roles that they fill in for their group. Mari is the “ojou” of the group and works on designing clothes. Kotoko is the “cute nerd” of the group and works with the logistics. Rito is the calm “stoic” in the group and works with the drawings. In battle, Rito focuses on attacking, Kotoko provides support, and Mari deals the finishing blows. In general, the presentation of the characters leaves something to be desired. They come off as trite tropes. The characters are cute, but they are mainly flat and have tedious dialogue exchanges. The dialogue proves to be a challenge to get through at times when the characters keep an uninteresting conversation going and prolonging the duration of that specific moment. Moments where Kotoko was going on and explaining the situation in detail and when the characters were reacting to certain parts were not the most entertaining. Despite those faults, there is still some characterization to be had in the latter half of the anime. The girls&#039; insecurities are explored, and you get a sense of understanding of where each character comes from. Mari has a desire to be popular and gain many followers, Rito wants her art to be recognized and liked, and Kotoko wants others to accept her quirky and inquisitive self. Each character goes through a moment of self-reflection, and they work on overcoming their flaws. Even Misa grows and learns something through the power of friendship and creativity. Yet, even with the characters getting explored more, you are still left with the same clichéd characters from the beginning.<br />
<br />
The visuals are the most memorable part of Urahara as they maintain the creative element of the anime. A more stylistic approach is taken with colorful and vibrant designs mixed with sketchy drawings. Despite how rough and incomplete some of the designs look, it gives the show a unique quality to it that adds to its quaintness. Everything is cute, and the backgrounds are detailed with all sorts of adorable decorative features. One major gripe with the art would be the animation of it. The panels used in the animation may be considered lazy, but they could be considered as aiding in providing a different mode of storytelling – adding to Urahara&#039;s distinct style. There are also moments when the characters turn into chibis, and that adds to the cuteness appeal of the show. Despite these different techniques, the animation is lacking, leaving a desolate sort of feeling. This is apparent in the last major fight of the anime, and it comes off as disappointing and dull to have such a lackluster ending. <br />
<br />
The sounds of the anime are nothing too special – the voice actors do a good job portraying the different characters, but some of the voices can get annoying if you are not into the &quot;cutesy&quot; types like Kotoko and Misa. The music itself is not remarkable. The use of orchestral music is prevalent and there are lots of whimsical sounding pieces throughout.<br />
<br />
Overall, despite the flaws of the anime, the story is able to present its themes and ideas decently enough. The creative process is a daunting journey. Throughout Urahara, the characters go through trials and self-doubts of their own creativity. As seen in Urahara, expressing yourself can be troublesome due to insecurities, art thieves, and other obstacles. However, in the end, the characters overcome their obstacles and work toward their dream of working together in creating various unique pieces. If you are looking for a cute and simple anime with cute girls and visuals, this is the anime for you.

    Urahara is dreadful. <br />

It tries to trick you into liking it by having a unique style and plot twists but don&#039;t be fooled, Urahara has very little to it in the end. <br />

Story: 3<br />
The story in this show is nothing. Aliens called Scoopers come to earth and steal culture, because that&#039;s what they do, they have no culture so they steal it. It&#039;s worth noting that, in episode 1 the humans decide to call them Scoopers because of how they &quot;scoop&quot; up culture and that turns out to just be the actual name of the species. Anyway it takes place in Harajuku where three girls

        with a barebones ability to simulate human emotion are running a store called &quot;Park.&quot; A little girl and sentient fried shrimp show up and give them these little things that look like truffles and they get magical girl transformation sequences and go to fight the Scoopers. It could definitely be more generic but it&#039;s certainly not creative, despite its overuse of the word. <br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
Art is the only thing I give a decent score because the backgrounds at least are unique. It has a distinctive art style that does not at all translate into animation. The animation in this show is terrible, I&#039;ve seen One Piece episodes that were animated better. The character designs are interesting but none of it means anything. Kotoko has cat ears and a tail and Rito has devil horns but they&#039;re just like... a fashion thing. Kotoko doesn&#039;t act particularly like a cat, Rito doesn&#039;t act particularly like a demon, it&#039;s just a shorthand to make the characters look different. Also, after a few episodes the pastels start to hurt your eyes, so the art style doesn&#039;t actually work that well. <br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
I don&#039;t remember any of the tracks from this show outside of the opening, which changes tempo seemingly at random. I eventually started skipping it. The voice acting is pretty bad, though it does improve a little by the end of the series. Misa&#039;s verbal tick becomes flat out grating once she becomes a more important character though. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1<br />
The characters in this show suck. They are basic character traits extrapolated into people. <br />
<br />
Kotoko is the biggest offender. She&#039;s the smart character, and as such, they&#039;ll just have her say smart sounding things. One of the most obvious examples is when a character mentions DNA and she interjects to explain that DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid. <br />
Mari&#039;s personality is all over the place. In one episode she&#039;ll be a diva, obsessed with her followers, and in another she&#039;s always just been a clothing designer who really wants to own a store. <br />
Rito&#039;s personality is that she is the quiet one. She has at least some development in terms of accepting that her art&#039;s quality isn&#039;t defined by how many people see it. <br />
All three of them are terrible at expressing emotion, their eyes basically always look the same, which is weird in such a stylized show where they should really be going off-model more often. Instead they have a standard model and a chibi model. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
This is not a fun show to watch. It&#039;s tedious, some episodes have just actual filler. Episode 9 has 10 actual minutes of people begging with each other and getting nowhere. The end of the series in particular is really bad with its time wasting, and I get the feeling this was supposed to be a 10 episode series that got stretched on to 12. Seriously episode 11 has an almost Scooby Doo-esque chase scene that is just there to waste time. It&#039;s not even well animated. On top of that, some of the scenes in episode 9 are legitimately vomit inducing. <br />
<br />
Overall: 2<br />
I can&#039;t in good faith give Urahara a 1. It has inventive character and background art and I think someone there was trying, but there is just no appeal here. Do not watch Urahara.

    For a show which preached so much about creativity, expectations certainly weren’t met.<br />
<br />
In fact, I think one of the major issues with the show lies with the messages the show attempts preaching. While I can’t blame the show for having such messages having dug into the actual back story regarding this particular series, the fact remains the messages the show puts forth regarding creativity are unrealistic. There is an attempt towards the end to lampshade the messages, yet this ends up falling flat because of issues regarding the characters not to mention the plot.<br />
<br />
Would three girls in high school be able to start their own

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345815">
        pop-up store? Fundamentally, if the girls put in a lot of hard work AND their high school didn’t forbid having a job the answer is a resounding yes. At the beginning of the series one is actually led to believe this is the case, at least regarding the hard work part. The second tends to come up only when a high school does forbid having jobs. In reality, the pop-up store is handed to the girls, which would only happen if someone else saw their work and decided to give them a chance. There’s also the question of how they came up with so much product so quickly. Then there’s the girl’s wonderful friendship. The series does reveal the girls met in Harajuku and became friends, there’s the impression they’ve known each other for some time only for this to yet again be tossed out later on. In reality, they only met recently having met each other at their brand-new job, which then somehow led to them getting the pop-up.<br />
<br />
Of course, there’s issues with each of the three girls.<br />
<br />
Starting with Mari, I felt calling her a plagiarist a bit harsh given the fact she’s effectively an indie pop idol hoping someone might pick her up. This means copying the choreography of others to showcase how she is able to replicate moves to perfection which would then lead to someone choreographing original moves for her, yet the show places a lot of emphasis on her doing everything on her own. The show is also rather down on her use of current trends within the fashion, basically claiming the use of trends makes her a plagiarist when it does not, particularly if she put her own spin on the latest fashion trend. Coming up with a new trend isn’t something which should be expected of someone in high school. Is it important she starts bridging out – yes, but the show could have tackled this much differently.<br />
<br />
Then there’s Kotoko whom we’re supposed to believe gets rejected by all of the weird contraptions she makes even by her parents, yet there is nothing weird regarding her gadgets. In fact, the gadget she showed off to her parents would normally make the parents attempt to find some kind of creative outlet for said child even in Japan. There’s an inkling that what she thinks of as cute isn’t seen as cute by others, but this is undermined by her agreeing with what others thing of as cute. Her loneliness plays a major role within the series, but ends up falling flat because of this.<br />
<br />
Finally, there’s Rito. In some ways her character is relatable. Many young artists fear showing their art work to others, which is something they hit spot on. However, with her character comes the message of creating what one wants rather than what others want. Artists who live by this rule don’t survive unless they’re extremely lucky and talented – which apparently Rito is. In reality, an artist does need to be able to create to other people’s speculations in order to make a living. There’s also the issue of her art work apparently not being complete with the girl when in reality it was. The house ended up being an important theme only to be dropped. I mean, we never learn what happened to her parents because the message of creativity plays such a more important role.<br />
<br />
Then there’s the message of being able to do anything with the power of friendship. I’ve seen firsthand how the power of friendship actually hinders rather than helps the creativity process. Specifically, friend and family aren’t likely to tell one the truth regarding ones creative process thus one isn’t able to eliminate what doesn’t work. In fact, there is this idea that one should showcase all of their work, when a portfolio should focus on ones best works, but ultimately the show sets up for some very unrealistic expectations.<br />

    Temporary Edit:<br />
Just finished watching episode 9 and the turn of events as well as the pace of the story suddenly took a huge dip downwards. What I mean by downwards is in terms of viewer age, so originally I felt this show was meant for age 14+, now it felt more like 10+. I will suggest to new viewers to wait and see if future reviews will change their scores before starting this show. But with that said, the show is still decent with unique art style and is fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Currently due to the latest episode (ep.9) I adjusted my review from Story:8 -&gt;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263960">
        7 and Overall 8-&gt;7.<br />
<br />
As there are three more episodes I&#039;ll hope for the best, good things can still happen.<br />
--------------<br />
To paraphrase other reviews I read about this show:<br />
<br />
1. Urahara is an anime show that is like a fairy tale for adults. (ignore this for now)<br />
<br />
2. Urahara is a show for people who knows the virtue of patience.<br />
<br />
The show itself is quite enjoyable with good art and music, though it might take some time to get used to because of the clear difference to the average anime we have all been watching. But none the less, it is a good show.<br />
<br />
Though I can&#039;t say for certain the art and sound is on a whole different level, but the story itself is a master piece (hopefully not proven wrong by later episodes).<br />
<br />
Let me try to summarize as much of the story as possible without spoiling the show:<br />
<br />
1. Urahara starts episode one with most of the settings being already described to the watchers. While many dismisses the show and gives it a bad rating due to the typical Mahou Shojou genre activities, this show actually goes in depth to what can actually happen in these types of encounters. (I thought people would learn after Madoka and Ikusei Keikaku)<br />
<br />
2. Continuing on the previous point, unlike some of the Shounen battle type of stories where people complain about themselves overthinking about the plots. In Urahara, the plots actually got a lot deeper than what most people have thought about while watching.<br />
<br />
3. This is not a slice-of-life or Shoujo type of story, so people looking forward to a heart warming story, I warn you to stop.<br />
<br />
I will end this review by stating that I personally enjoyed this show quite a bit and leave with some thoughts that came by my mind while watching episode 8.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know who is sane, if the whole world is crazy? What is actually the reality?&quot;

    This synopsis gave me same feeling as Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven and that is the only reason i started watching this. I was not wrong.<br />
<br />
Story: Nothing is explained, you are completely lost,no plot, nothing just girls doing random stuff thinking its cute, AND IT ISN&#039;T DAMN DANIEL.<br />
<br />
Art: I will probably get epilepsy till the end of this show. It feels like they didn&#039;t even try to make it look nice, it was like fu*k it, lets just make some bad art cause we know from this synopsys its gonna be retarded.So we can maybe go intro history defeating Yoshiteru Satoru masterpieces.<br />
<br />
Characters: Now this is what makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262160">
        this show bad, i don&#039;t even know what to say to these characters, probably writter didn&#039;t know himself what to do so he just randomly put girls that eat whole day and do stupid things.<br />
<br />
Sound: This is only thing that is good in this show and i meant good compared to other aspects of this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This is torture, not a single thing of enjoyment, i keep watching this show only cause im not the type that drop shows, just a few.<br />
<br />
Overall: Honestly i feel bad for the writter that will get roasted cause of this show, combined with all that was in this show it got its max with overall 4

    Creativity is EVERYTHING<br />
<br />
Urahara is probably one of the most ambitious and experimental anime for Fall 2017 for LA with varying results.<br />
<br />
Urahara focuses on Mari Shirako voiced by Sumire Uesaka an amateur actress and the owner of PARK, Rito Sudou voiced by Luna Haruna, the illustrator of PARK and Kotoko Watatsumugi voiced by Manaka Iwami an eccentric inventor who helps around PARK. Harajuku soon faces an alien invasion where these aliens named Scoopers loves to steal the &quot;creativity&quot; and thus the members of PARK by gaining some supernatural powers to defeat these Scoopers so that they can keep their PARK and defend Harajuku.<br />
<br />
Urahara as an anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265748">
        obviously has a pretty focused theme around creativity, with our main characters essentially being creators themselves with Scoopers wanting to steal that creativity and even this seeps into how the animation looks as well. However with Rito, Mari and Kotoko this also goes into their character development and the stages of grief with creativity in many ways. <br />
<br />
LA cannot talk about Urahara without how it does it&#039;s plot twists and there are actually ALOT for what is a simple &quot;magical girl-esque&quot; anime about defending a city from creative stealing aliens. For one thing, Urahara does the entire &quot;look beyond the cover&quot; for such an anime and for LA at least duped LA into thinking this was a happy go lucky anime....it still is....but when it gets serious, they get serious no matter how cutezy they bring the atmosphere.  How the plot twists keeps stacking up as well as this affecting our main trio also  brings in their character development intrinsically linked to what else...creativity. From Rito&#039;s dilemma about her drawings, to Mari&#039;s popularity getting to her head and cling onto it to Kotoko wanting to help her friends in order to make her...her, because of how introverted and eccentric she is. LA actually got invested to Mari and Rito the most though LA&#039;s personality is similar to Kotoko in many ways as well. The plot twists &quot;makes sense&quot; as the anime unravels itself and soon enough brings us one of the weirdest true villain for Fall 2017 and actually becomes a threat to the plot.<br />
<br />
The animation by Shirogumi and EMT² is experimental to say the least, by bringing us what is essentially a kids-book-ish drawings background that also goes into the character designs of the chibified comedic moments of the anime. The animation is obviously hard enough to used to, but LA got used to it if only because of the uncanny valley feeling to the anime, but oddly enough this actually becomes a PLOT POINT, so this wasn&#039;t Shirogumi and EMT² being lazy. So yeah Urahara&#039;s main draw and something to put attention to in Fall 2017 was the animation, no doubt for better or worse.<br />
<br />
The voice acting has some problems for LA...yeah this was coming. First thing though would be that this is Luna Haruna&#039;s first anime appearance, you might know Luna as a Japanese singer who sung Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata&#039;s OP, now her performance all things considered, she sounded like an actual teenager which was rather nice to hear. Sumire Uesaka was also pretty decent as well. The &quot;problem&quot; however goes to Manaka Iwami as Kotoko and Kokoa Amano as Misa Maruno as they go into &quot;squeak&quot; territory and this was just LA but Misa&#039;s &quot;desu na!&quot; character tic got old pretty quickly to the point of annoyance. Luna Haruna obviously got best voice actor for Urahara with Sumire Uesaka being second. Nonetheless, the voice acting is decent overall even with the annoyances.<br />
<br />
Urahara seems to be a love letter in a ways to those experimentally crazy fun animes or just to an ode to creativity and how great it is or how it can lead to problems. LA enjoyed Urahara for trying something utterly different for Fall 2017 and sticking to it&#039;s guns, sure it has some problems from the uncanny valley animation and slow pacing that would have put off audiences, but Urahara is fine nonetheless. Urahara is neither insulting awful or the pinnacle of greatness....it&#039;s just in the middle trying to tell a story of creativity. <br />
<br />
Urahara is good. Urahara is CREATIVE thus, Urahara is good.

    I wanted a simple, colorful anime to mindlessly watch during quarantine. And while this anime gave me that, it had more story to it than what I expected. The pacing can be a bit wonky at bits but things add up to create a nice story, even though at first it seemed like it would be a &quot;one new enemy per episode&quot; type of anime. It lost me at some parts but I enjoyed watching it overall.<br />
<br />
Story: 6.<br />
Some aliens come to the Earth in order to steal culture, and three friends try to stop them with the help of a mysterious girl. It manages to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340979">
        keep a certain structure to the episode (new enemy appears, girls defeat it, they eat something together) while advancing the plot at the same time, even though by the end of the series they stop using that structure.<br />
<br />
It had a few plot twist and, while they didn&#039;t had a lot of foreshadowing, I didn&#039;t feel like they came out of nowhere either. Sometimes I caught myself thinking that I would&#039;ve handled certain things differently, but I&#039;m not the target audience for this and the series it&#039;s actually enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Some scenes were longer than they needed to be, with the characters repeating what they wanted or felt multiple times during them when it wasn&#039;t really necessary. Like have a little bit more faith in your audience. But they weren&#039;t unwatchable either.<br />
<br />
Art: 8.<br />
The main reason why I watched the series in the first time. I loved the colorful aesthetic that the trailer and the cover had, and I wasn&#039;t disappointed. The animation was a bit wonky at times but I enjoyed this regardless.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.<br />
The background music was okay, I guess. I enjoyed both the opening and the ending.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7.<br />
They weren&#039;t the most deep characters ever, but I enjoyed them regardless. They had defined personalities and struggles that I could relate to, so they contributed to my enjoyment of the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8.<br />
As I said, I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. The aesthetic was super nice to my eyes and I feel the story was well rounded even though it wasn&#039;t perfect. It didn&#039;t had me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next episode but it managed to keep me guessing at times. It isn&#039;t a groundbreaking anime but it doesn&#039;t need to, and I would love to watch something similar someday.<br />
<br />
Overall I gave it a 7. I wont tell you to go watch this anime immediately, but if you have some time to kill it will serve.

Not even try. Nothing new and poorly written.<br />

Art:<br />

One of the best art I saw in a long time.  <br />
I wish the artist had a better writer for this project.<br />
Well, I can just get wallpapers and admire the art. ;)<br />

Sound:<br />
Just kill me. Done by someone who played too many VN and now got a new job and doesn&#039;t know what the hell he is doing. <br />

Neglected. <br />

I dropped on this one and left a bad taste in my moths.<br />
Pity for the art. Art is amazing.<br />

    for those who dropped the show early, i can understand, the 3 eps rule ain&#039;t applicable for this show tbh, i was close to dropping it at episode 4 but the colorful tone is what was keeping me from dropping. Then after episode 6 and recently, episode 7, the show turned into a much darker tone, it feels like back when i was watching madoka the first time. Urahara took 6 episodes to deliver the truth to us, and as a result the show ain&#039;t so shit anymore. As the truth about misa being a scooper in disguise the whole time revealed, plus the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263412">
        heroines are turning into scoopers definitely brought the show to that level of madoka. Ep7 was filled with despair and drama, i&#039;m bad at recapping the contents to bring enough interests to the readers of this preview. I can only say that if you can manage to watch from the start up to episode 7, you&#039;ll feel the satisfaction, you&#039;ll see that this show is so underrated and you&#039;ll definitely feel the betrayal of the common &quot;mahoushoujo fighting evils with the power of friendship to save the city&quot; genre and instead, the feels when you see the characters suffering psychologically.

    URAHARA is a very unique anime. It is made to represent the city of Harajuku in Japan which is crazy and wacky, which this anime captures amazingly ((As I have been there myself)). Other than that, here is my look on each part of the show.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story is no doubt new. If you want something different from the cliche, you may enjoy this. I however found the idea interesting. Of corse they had the idea there, it just wasn&#039;t presented very well. The explanation they give is very confusing and you need a minute to take in just what it means. The pacing is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264742">
        also very fast as they just go from being normal girls to super girls all within&#039; 1 episode. At least it is wasting no time and is getting straight to the point which I like.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
The art in this is very memorable. Lots of colour and unique objects that are hard to forget. The style of the art though really turns me off. It&#039;s rough and done to be a scrapbook style. I don&#039;t particularly like that. Some might though as this is just all my opinion.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
I LOVE the Theme song and Ending song. They match up quite well with what the show is all about and I like that. The sound track is quite average as well as the sound effects. Nothing too special in that field.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
I should have marked this lower, but I&#039;m being very kind because I love Rito. She is a likeable character because of her calm and strong-willed nature. All of the other characters are very cliched though, some annoying. The designs of the 3 girls and the Scoopers are appealing to the eye though which I do enjoy. It&#039;s just their personalities that let them down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
It was quite enjoyable to watch because of the visuals and their voices. I liked that part very much. It held my attention and left me smiling, and thats all I ask for in a show. To entertain me which it did.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
I like this show, but it&#039;s nothing too special. It might grow more on me the more I watch, but for now, I think it&#039;s best for people who are just looking for something new to watch. Young girls should enjoy this, but don&#039;t expect too much. It&#039;s not going to be very big because it&#039;s not aimed at westerners clearly. It&#039;s just enough to leave you pondering with a happy feeling afterwards.

    Well I started watching Urahara because of the art style and animation and I had high hopes for it so I kept watching it. <br />

Well honestly the anime didn&#039;t reach my expectations and you need to be really patient for the plot twist that occur throughout the series. It follows the normal trend about magic girl&#039;s anime and I recommend you to watch it if you enjoy those types of anime with moe design. The art and animations is pretty good and I found it unique from the anime I have watch, but the characters and story seem typical and I personally couldn&#039;t like the

        characters that much. It has some good points with the story and art design but I couldn&#039;t enjoy it that well.<br />
<br />
 Watch it if you like moe magical girls&#039; anime but be patient because the story is slow. <br />

    If really nice art and cute (but ultimately boring, empty, and forgettable) characters can outweigh a story that lacks a sense of pacing and tone or feeling even I&#039;d highly recommend this show. The problem that I have personally is that I feel like it was not very well thought out, no aspect of it, like they were just making it up as they went, a lot of things like characters with personalities or a general mood seem to be secondary to putting out something that LOOKS cute and fun, and it does LOOK great but it feels not so awesome. The art was really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267148">
        good, just that was really what kept me watching through the entire show, but it just falls short in so many areas, the characters were all bland and flawed in really predictable ways, I suppose they were relatable but I didn&#039;t really like or dislike any of them, I don&#039;t really remember almost anything about any of them, they were either completely forgettable or totally obnoxious like the shrimp guy and the crepe stand woman. Overall I would say JUST FOR THE ART it&#039;s original and worth checking out but really not so great in any other aspect.

    The art is beautiful and the story concept is intriguing but the execution/writing/voice acting is lackluster and boring. If I could describe this anime in one word it would be: Loud. There is everything and nothing going on in this anime- too slow and too fast at times, horrible pacing issues. I wonder if a better format would be 5-10min episodes or perhaps a 3 episode ova because this anime is way too long for its own good. If you want to zone out or have some nonsensical brain/background noise (which sometimes I do and can apricate). Art is unique but everything else is cliche
