    I&#039;d like more people to give this show a chance.<br />
<br />
At first glance at the title, the first impression was that the show &quot;Tiger &amp; Bunny&quot; will be a cutesy show with talking tigers and bunnies. It is not.<br />
This may be a disappointment for some.<br />
<br />
And looking at the promotional art, people assume &quot;Oh it&#039;s some mecha anime. Since I don&#039;t like mecha, I won&#039;t watch it.&quot; I assure you, this show is not about mechas at all. Those &quot;mechas&quot; are in actuality the main characters of the show in their power suits. Calling them &quot;mechas&quot; is akin to calling Tony Stark (of Iron Man fame) a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35886">
        mecha pilot. <br />
<br />
Now, you must be wondering what this show actually IS. To be blunt, it&#039;s a hyperactive fluffy kid&#039;s show, much like the 7:00 Saturday morning cartoons many people used to watch way back when. The plot is extremely simple, and fast moving. It&#039;s basically a show about good old fashioned superheroes (attempting to) kick some bad guy butt.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re here to know more details, it&#039;s better to just look at the description and watch the show. It&#039;s extremely simplistic.<br />
<br />
However, that isn&#039;t to say that there isn&#039;t anything for the older viewer. Besides some of the nostalgia rush that I get from watching this show, I see some intriguing plot factors pop up that separate this from any other anime or superhero show (Western or otherwise). <br />
<br />
1.) This show is STUFFED TO THE GILLS in product placement. This is not a bad thing. To the contrary, it adds to the appeal to the show. Rather than tasteless placement, it adds to the setting. These superheroes are commodities. Capitalism has taken advantage of the charismatic heroes, and they are used to advertise products. It&#039;s not much different from now, with people slapping celebrity names onto products in order to sell. <br />
<br />
2.) This show is light. While modern day superhero stories tend to go for &quot;darker and edgier&quot; plots (Watchmen, Batman, etc.), this show remains untouched by such baggage and instead opts for optimism and feel good messages. &quot;Believe in yourself. Be proud of who you are.&quot; You&#039;ll be rooting for the heroes the whole time.<br />
<br />
3.) The main character is an older man with a daughter. Let me tell you: this is mind blowing. Instead of using a child/teenage character as the protagonist, they use an aging papa bear character. The protagonist is someone the audience has someone to sympathize with, and many anime go the lazy route and use a child/teenager as the protagonist for us to sympathize with due to age similarity to the target audience. But Kotetsu is genuinely likable despite his older age setting.<br />
<br />
^TL;DR: The story is great and unique, and is quite different from modern day anime offerings and superhero shows. It uses it&#039;s premise and setting to its advantage.<br />
<br />
The characterization is great. Kotetsu is an idealist, though not frustratingly so. He&#039;s basically balancing his own individuality against the expectations of his employers, and his ability to compromise prevents long drawn out misunderstandings. The other heroes seem to have their own agenda, especially Kotetsu&#039;s unwilling partner, Barnaby. Characterization through action, not description, is the series&#039; strong point. These aren&#039;t just archetypes with faces.<br />
<br />
Many complaints with the show deal with the CGI. Honestly, it&#039;s not to much of a problem. With some of the Karas staff on board, the CGI is integrated well, with no glaring problems. It beats some of the cheap 2D &quot;QUALITY&quot; animation that we are subject to every anime season.<br />
<br />
All in all, this show is wonderful. It makes me feel excited to see what&#039;s in store next, though I realize this may not be everyone&#039;s cup of tea: the whole &quot;Western&quot; feel of the show can throw people off. But it is this exact &quot;Western&quot; feel that made Cowboy Bebop and Trigun so successful, and I hope that this show continues to appeal to various demographics. <br />
<br />
I say give this show a shot for the first episode, and see if you feel like a kid waiting for next week&#039;s 7:00 Saturday morning cartoons.

    Superheroes have long been a staple of popular culture, especially in the West, and over the years characters like Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and even The Hulk have become household names. With their popularity at an all-time high thanks to video game tie-ins and movie adaptations, it&#039;s only natural that pretenders to the thrones that Marvel and DC sit upon should crawl out of the woodwork.<br />
<br />
The most obvious attempts to capitalise on the success of these comic-book creations have come from television and cinema, but while shows like &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Misfits&quot; have found a degree of success, the majority of attempts to reinvent, reboot or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56195">
        revamp the superhero genre have ended in ignominy.<br />
<br />
Which is where Tiger &amp; Bunny swagger onto the stage.<br />
<br />
Set in Sternbild City (a fictional version of New York), the story begins 45 years after super-powered humans known as NEXT first began to appear. In the decades that followed, individuals with superhuman abilities took on the roles of heroes and villains, and over time the constant to and fro between both sides became a form of entertainment. Fast forward to NC 1978, where the forces for good have their own specialised broadcast - &quot;Hero TV&quot;, corporate sponsorships, and a chance to accrue points in order to win the coveted title of &quot;King of Heroes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Every day brings new challenges for these intrepid do-gooders, but Sternbild City has been built upon many secrets, and when Barnaby Brooks Jr. takes his place amongst those who stand for truth and justice, the shadows of the past begin to move once more.<br />
<br />
At first glance Tiger &amp; Bunny may seem like nothing more than a super-powered &quot;buddy&quot; show, and to a certain degree that&#039;s a fair assessment. The plot is relatively straightforward (but also rather predictable), and although there are several elements that add a veneer of complexity, none of these affect the pacing or progression of the storyline - mainly because it has been split into two major chapters. This has the effect of setting a &quot;deadline&quot; for the conclusion of certain arcs, which in turn adds a brevity to the narrative that prevents the atmosphere becoming stale.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately some viewers may find themselves annoyed by the fact that certain episodes appear to deviate from the main plot by focusing on one or more of the supporting characters. Now while this usually a valid complaint, these &quot;fillers&quot; often serve as a platform to introduce themes, characters or events that may have a lasting effect on the story proper. In addition to this, the episodes in question have very little impact on the flow of the narrative, and in a very real sense this show is a good example of how &quot;fillers&quot; can add to the whole story.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the visuals, Tiger &amp; Bunny certainly looks the part, but it&#039;s not without its flaws. The artwork is of a good standard, with a nice variety of character designs, settings, and outlandish costumes that uphold the reputation of superheroes everywhere. The series is well animated for the most part, and while there are the usual (and very minor), anime-related problems when it comes to wardrobes, one particular issue continues to crop up throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Technology has progressed to the point where computer generated imagery can often be blended with more traditional animation to good effect, but for some reason Sunrise has decided to be a little more ostentatious in its approach - which has led to a few complications. The main problem lies in the movement of the heroes after they don their costumes, and in several action sequences the studio&#039;s attempts to exaggerate the actions of the characters can make the entire scene look more than a little ... odd.<br />
<br />
That said, many viewers may forgive the slightly weird feeling they get from the CG, but only because the overall look is decidedly refreshing and the show makes very good use of some rather nice visual effects.<br />
<br />
Tiger &amp; Bunny features two opening sequences, both of which introduce the main heroes (with particular attention paid to their sponsors), alongside a few short scenes that display their powers. The only real difference between the two OP&#039;s are the songs attached to them - &quot;Orion o Nazoru&quot; by Unison Square Garden (a rather upbeat rock song), and &quot;Missing Link&quot; by Novels (a surprisingly bittersweet rock ballad). The series also features two closing sequence, the first of which is a fairly simple affair that focuses on the characters of Kaburagi Koutetsu and Barnaby Brooks Jr. while &quot;Hoshi no Sumika&quot; by Aobozu plays out. The second ED is much more in keeping with the great traditions of the anime industry as it uses still images of the characters alongside some fairly basic visual effects - all to the J-Pop stylings of Tamaki&#039;s &quot;Mind Game&quot;<br />
<br />
When it comes to background music it seems like Tiger &amp; Bunny is on firmer ground, and much of the soundtrack is littered with anthems that echo of heroism, action, and good old comic-book cheese. In addition to this there are a wide range of well defined audio effects, and overall the series is remarkably balanced in terms of its choreography.<br />
<br />
As one might expect from a superhero tale, the dialogue is awash wish one-liners, catchphrases and other sentences that tend come out of the mouths of costumed vigilantes. That said, the script is surprising in both its intelligence and humour, and although there&#039;s the ever-present shadow of cheese, it&#039;s not enough to deter the voice actors from delivering some fine performances. Hirata Hiraoki and Morita Masakazu are in good form as the laconic veteran Kaburagi Koutetsu (a.k.a. Wild Tiger), and the fiery young Barnaby Brooks Jr., but while the two have a good on-screen rapport, the cornerstone of the dialogue is the camaraderie between the heroes as a group.<br />
<br />
One of the nice things about Tiger &amp; Bunny is that the characters represent a wide range of ages and backgrounds, and although the majority of them are adults, the show also tries to offer some insight into the personalities of the more prominent teenaged heroes. Koutetsu is a particularly interesting individual - a widowed father who rarely sees his ten-year old daughter (who lives with her grandmother), because of his &quot;work&quot;, and this lays a very strong and unusual (for anime that is), foundation for development. A big plus is that rather than travel down the Ikari Gendou route towards a &quot;bad end&quot;, the writers have decided to adopt an approach that&#039;s more akin to &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, with Koutetsu in the role of the aging veteran.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Barnaby Brooks Jr. is Batman.<br />
<br />
No, seriously.<br />
<br />
The problem is that where Barnaby is concerned, nobody has tried to think outside of the box (as they do with Koutetsu), and it&#039;s for this reason that his background is one of the biggest stereotypes in the world of superheroes. Because of his origins, many of the changes in his personality over the course of the series can feel derived, and this is especially true where his relationship with Koutetsu is concerned. Thankfully the show has a pretty good set of supporting characters, and unlike many other anime, the series uses the relationships between the majority of the characters rather well.<br />
<br />
If one compares Tiger &amp; Bunny to its Western counterparts then it manages to hold its own, but only just as the weight of the superhero genre in America and Europe is enough to crush almost any challenger. That said, the series is a refreshing change from the shounen fare that&#039;s being served these days, and one of the most laudable aspects is that Sunrise haven&#039;t been afraid to take inspiration from Western media.<br />
<br />
Which brings up one small but important point.<br />
<br />
The majority of popular heroes were created decades ago, and since then there have been many attempts to update them so that they always appear to be in keeping with modern trends and tastes. Unfortunately these changes are only skin-deep, and aside from recent titles like &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Misfits&quot;, &quot;Kick Ass&quot;, &quot;Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Super&quot;, the majority of Western tales don&#039;t really serve as a good reflection of modern times, even if their core message remains valid. It&#039;s in this particular area where Tiger &amp; Bunny stands above many other stories, mainly because of its focus on &quot;reality TV&quot;, celebrity culture and corporate sponsorship. In a very real sense the anime highlights a direction that has been blatantly ignored, and while the whole concept may seem alien to diehard fans of Western comic-books, the simple fact is that modern superhero stories tend to follow the same formula that has been the mainstay of the industry for decades.<br />
<br />
Overall, Tiger &amp; Bunny is an enjoyable take on the genre that blends several old ideas and puts them in a setting that, while futuristic, is more a reflection of modern society than many people might initially believe. The mixture of super-powered shenanigans, comedy and drama is very much in keeping with the best traditions of action movies everywhere, and in all honesty that&#039;s probably the best way to approach the series.<br />
<br />
But that doesn&#039;t automatically make it no-brain entertainment.

    Before it came out, I saw the title and a poster art, and I figured it would be Playboy-esque.  Or about Mafia.  Then on a fansub site, I saw it tagged as a shounen mecha with action and comedy.  Now I was confused.  But whichever it was (about Mafia or mecha) it wasn&#039;t gonna be good.<br />
<br />
Then I saw that episode 1 was on Hulu.  HULU?  Was this legitimacy?  OK, so I watched it.  It was not what I was expecting.  It&#039;s not about Mafia or mecha.  It&#039;s about SUPERHEROES!  Why couldn&#039;t somebody just come

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36371">
        out and say so?  But mind you, this isn&#039;t like the other Japanese superhero animes that are re-makes revolving around American-made characters.  This ain&#039;t Wolverine or Iron Man, folks.  No, this is good stuff.  GOOOOOOD.  Just count how many times I use &quot;awesome&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; in this review.<br />
<br />
Here we have bright and saturated visuals, comedy, some pretty sweet action sequences, loveable characters, and enough drama and melodrama to keep a sieve full.  And an interesting twist on athlete sponsorship.<br />
<br />
SYNOPSIS:<br />
<br />
This is Stern Bild, the bright city of the (American) future, where citizens are kept safe by the troop of the city&#039;s resident heroes.  But these heroes aren&#039;t freelancers or government employees.  No, they&#039;re privately sponsored.  After all, it takes big bucks to get those suits done at the dry cleaners.  But that sponsorship doesn&#039;t just mean they get corporate logos slapped all over them like a biker or racecar.  No, they have to let camera crews follow them around, to broadcast their feats in reality-TV style.<br />
<br />
Our main character is one of these heroes, Kotetsu, whose hero name is Wild Tiger.  Back in the day, he was cool.  But now he&#039;s older, and has lost his shine.   And his tween daughter thinks he&#039;s an absolute dweeb.<br />
<br />
When his current hero company goes under, he gets transferred to another, where they aren&#039;t too thrilled about having an old has-been hero.  So they make the unusual decision to partner him up with another hero, and sell them to audiences as a team.  They pick one that has the exact same superpower as Wild Tiger.  And it happens that this guy&#039;s everything that Kotetsu is not: fresh, new, young, arrogant, no sense of humor, dutiful to the sponsors, and he uses his real name for his hero work.  Everyone knows that heroes are supposed to have a secret identity!  Young upstart.  <br />
<br />
So Kotetsu&#039;s partnership with Barnaby Brooks Jr. gets off to a rough beginning.  And it stays that way for a loooooong time, while Kotetsu keeps trying to loosen &quot;Bunny-chan&quot; up.  (Yes, Barnaby is the &#039;Bunny&#039; in Tiger &amp; Bunny.)   But Bunny isn&#039;t a hero just to do good.  He has a specific goal in mind, and he won&#039;t let Kotetsu&#039;s goofiness distract him.  <br />
<br />
It turns out they will both need to learn a lot about each other to get this partnership to work.<br />
<br />
MOST EVERYTHING ELSE:<br />
<br />
I tried a few minutes of some of the animes based on Marvel characters.  I didn&#039;t like them.  And judging by their low MAL ratings, most other people don&#039;t either.  But this is an original story.  Fresher, brighter, and with no comic book (or manga) to compare it to.  But you can still see classic superhero roots, in the villains particularly.  They&#039;re generally very flashy, unlike real criminals.  And hey, we even get a mad scientist.  <br />
<br />
Even though Tiger and Bunny are our main characters, there is a whole cast of heroes that they work alongside: ice-caster Blue Rose (who has a crush on Tiger), the fire-shooting Fire Emblem, wind-warping Sky-High, hunky Rock Bison, tomboyish Dragon Kid, and Japanophile Origami.<br />
<br />
And there&#039;s non-hero characters.  Kotetsu&#039;s daughter Kaede, his mom, his former boss Ben.  His suit-maker, Saito, with the quiet voice (he gets his own subtitles, since apparently Tiger is the only one who can hear him).  Agnes, the producer of HERO-TV, the reality show that follows the heroes around.  Legend, the hero that saved Kotetsu as a kid, and encouraged him to become a hero himself.  The rogue Lunatic, dispenser of vigilante justice, who I think most people wanted to get more screentime.  (I wanted to see more of him too; after all, he&#039;s the only guy whose suit had bell-bottoms.  BELL-BOTTOMS.)<br />
<br />
It has a couple of story arcs.  Some are as short as one episode, and give us a close-up look at the life of one of the heroes in the story.  Other arcs span several episodes, as our heroes battle the villain of the moment.  But there are clues scattered throughout the series that are used later.  <br />
<br />
The action scenes are generally pretty cool.  There isn&#039;t one every episode, but when they come, they are, like, AWESOME!!!!  <br />
<br />
There&#039;s comedy aplenty, of the light kind.<br />
<br />
But what&#039;s at the core of the show is DRAMA.  Lots of it.  If the scene involving the little boy and the trading cards doesn&#039;t impact you some way, then you should just stop watching, because that&#039;s the melodramatic slant in this show.  There&#039;s the drama of a dad trying to get his kid to say he&#039;s cool.  Promising to meet with her, but then having to break his promise because he has been called to an assignment.  There&#039;s the drama of a man whose goal is to take revenge for his parents who were murdered.  You almost wonder if Barnaby suffers from depression, since he keeps getting bogged down in melodramatic angst, and takes it out on anybody who tries to get close to him.  And the one who tries to do that is our very own Kotetsu.  Barnaby is in serious need of some professional counseling.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, there is a bit racial variety.  Which is unusual for anime, but was probably obligatory since the story is set, after all, in a place much like the United States.  We have a couple of black characters: The mayor of Stern Bild (à la Obama, I&#039;m sure); Ben, who is Kotetsu&#039;s former boss and current mentor; and Fire Emblem (a lot of viewers chew out his character because he is the cliché gay character you see a lot in anime; oh well, the makers are still Japanese after all).  And Kotetsu and his family, and Saito are Asian...or more specifically, Japanese.  No other kinds of Asians around apparently.  And all the other characters are probably white.<br />
<br />
The animation is very awesome.  The setting is often the sparky-lit city at night.  Outlining is done in brown instead of the usual black, so the everything looks &quot;warm&quot; and alive.  Action scenes are done well.  And there&#039;s lots of CGI.  Which makes some purists mad.  The suits are where you see it most.  Some people squawk at this, which isn&#039;t fair, because it&#039;s usually done pretty well, especially for the chunky suits that Tiger and Barnaby wear.  The only place where it doesn&#039;t work very well is Fire Emblem&#039;s skin-tight suit.  Though his cape with the creeping-flames pattern is cool.  I&#039;d want one of those myself.<br />
<br />
Style.  There&#039;s lots of style.  There&#039;s something about this that almost says &quot;superheroes are a fashion statement.&quot;  Well, that and the fact that Tiger and Bunny almost ALWAYS wear the same clothes.  It&#039;s just begging for people to cosplay them.  And the music seems to fit in with the style.  The music is cool.  Awesomely awesome.  It varies from jazz to opera and places in-between.  I would be remiss if I didn&#039;t mention the Pixar movie &quot;The Incredibles.&quot;  Something about that retro-esque heroes-in-real-life feels very similar to this.<br />
<br />
MAKE SURE to watch after the ED in each episode.  Often, there&#039;s a little bit of extra story at the end before the previews roll.  And by then you might as well watch the previews too, since they&#039;re usually narrated by either Tiger or Barnany, and begin with him saying &quot;Hi, I&#039;m Tiger, the member of Tiger and Bunny who wears a beard!&quot; or something else idiotic.  Also, the episode titles are all in English, and based off some proverb.  Tiger doesn&#039;t even try to say the next episode title, but Barnaby does, and sound pretty horrible.  Some people said it was worth it to watch each episode just to hear Barnaby&#039;s Engrish at the end.<br />
<br />
Some viewers felt that the final arc in the series was a bit lame.  I wouldn&#039;t say it was terrible, but it definitely did go for the cliche situations of &quot;superhero meets the big boss&quot; and more.  Not necessarily bad, but it raised the bar pretty high for itself by then.  But fans are waiting to see if there will be a second season….<br />
<br />
WHAT IT&#039;S NOT:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not primarily action.  We don&#039;t get a full-blown action sequence every episode.  <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not primarily comedy, unless you want to laugh at Barnaby&#039;s childish attitude, or Kotetsu&#039;s blunders.  Which ARE funny.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s very little ecchi.  Unless you count Blue Rose&#039;s costume.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s little romance.  Blue Rose obviously has a thing for Kotetsu, even though he&#039;s a generation older than herself.  (It&#039;s OK Blue Rose, I sorta do too.)  Yaoi fans may be disappointed that nothing goes on between our two main characters.  (Though that hasn&#039;t prevented scores of Yaoi doujinshi from being made.)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also not hugely….intelligent.  I have to say this for people who are expecting an amazingly intricate and solid plot.  While the story overall is good and throws a few cureveballs, there are some mental goofs.  But that is all forgiven because the drama is SOOOO feel-good, and the characters are so loveable.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
<br />
I can say I&#039;m very happy to see this show as popular as it is.  I wrote a review after seeing episode 4, when the show&#039;s MAL rating was below 7.  Now it&#039;s above 8.  I&#039;m happy it&#039;s getting love.<br />
<br />
Unlike most shounen series which are primarily about an action or suspense-driven story, Tiger and Bunny&#039;s partnership, or attempt at a partnership, is the main draw.  You care about them, and the other characters.  You REALLY CARE.  You might even say this is meddling in seinen territory.  Which is probably why this attracts viewers from all sorts of demographics.  If you like drama, and a little action, comedy, nice music and animation, and an interesting setting, please, please give this a try.  But beware.  You might just get hooked.  <br />

    [Insert obligatory pretentious quote here]<br />
#3deep5me<br />
<br />
I have been told that I recommend this anime a bit too much.<br />
That&#039;s because it&#039;s so underrated. Every time i tell someone to watch it, they give me shit like &quot;I don&#039;t watch mech&quot; or &quot;Looks gay&quot;<br />
IT IS NOT FUCKING MECH. Learn to read the damn tags.<br />
As for the gay part, people can ship whichever characters they want, doesn&#039;t make it canon. As long as you avoid the doujins, you&#039;re good. Unless of course you like that kind of stuff, which is perfectly fine.<br />
I do admit the banner doesn&#039;t look too appealing. Trust me, the anime looks much better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story-<br />
Anime about people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205326">
        with special abilities are far from rare. But they are rarely done well. Tiger &amp; Bunny is about people with special abilities called NEXT. Some of these NEXT are chosen by sponsors to be superheroes. These superheroes are in a competition on live TV. Hero TV is the most popular show on TV. The hero with the most point at the end of the season is crowned as the &#039;King of Heroes&#039; <br />
I found the idea of commercialised superheroes to be really fresh.<br />
<br />
What is more important, the competition or people&#039;s lives?<br />
The story explores the main duo. It highlights the contrast in their views of justice and what it means to be a superhero. Another notable character is a vigilante, Lunatic, who believes that all criminals must die. He also happens to be my favourite character, his backstory was really touching. I actually gave a shit about him, and I&#039;m a sociopath.<br />
It&#039;s no just a mindless action, comedy though. It does make you think a bit. Since I didn&#039;t open with a real quote, here you go-<br />
&quot;The justice you speak of is truly weak and frail.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Art-<br />
The character designs are unique and I quite like them. The costumes/suits are all very different.<br />
The visuals are stunning, even Redline pales in comparison. There&#039;s just a slight problem when the characters are in their costumes, the CGI is a bit jerky and looks weird. But this isn&#039;t a major problem and is only noticeable in a few scenes. Other than that Eyegasm.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The two openings were very different from each other, but both were excellent. Orion wo nazoru is a cheerful song while Missing Link is a more emotional. The first ending was decent and the second was even better.<br />
The voice actors did a brilliant job, especially Hirata Hiroaki.<br />
I also checked out the english dub, but I wasn&#039;t too impressed. I didn&#039;t think Yuri Lowenthal was able to pull off Bunny&#039;s character very well.<br />
So I recommend sticking to the sub.<br />
The OST is absolutely brilliant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters-<br />
This is one of the major strengths of Tiger &amp; Bunny.<br />
Each and every character is well written. We are shown the backstory of all relevant characters. There is a considerable amount of development in most characters. The supporting characters especially standout. <br />
Tiger is a 40 year old man, with a teenage daughter. This is one of the things which sets Tiger &amp; Bunny apart. The main character isn&#039;t a perfect teenager. He has several existing problems. Including his relationship with his daughter.<br />
Bunny is a cliched character. But that&#039;s one of the reason he stands out. cause he&#039;s the only one like that.<br />
Lunatic is my waifu.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-<br />
Well we all love superhero movies and we all love anime. Why wouldn&#039;t we love this. <br />
The show really has something for everyone. Even a tad bit of fanservice, which you won&#039;t specifically notice unless you want to. It&#039;s pretty funny. And was a fun ride altogether.<br />
<br />
Overall-<br />
It&#039;s a 10/10 Masterpiece you will love it.<br />
<br />
Now stop reading this shit and go watch it.<br />

    Up in the sky, look!  It’s a bird!  It’s a plane!  <br />
No, it’s...  Billboard Man!  Fighting crime, defending the innocent, an whoring himself out like it’s his first night in Hollywood!<br />
<br />
It’s the distant future for us, and a bizarre mutation has started to occur among our population.  Human beings with superhuman powers are popping up everywhere, and we’ve taken to calling them Nexts...  Presumably because ‘mutants’ was taken.  We initially rejected these outcasts, until they decided to don costumes and assume the role of superheroes, defending the very people who judged them on live, national TV!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160133">
        the widowered single father Kotetsu Kaburagi, the human genome isn’t the only thing that’s been evolving.  In the decades since Hero TV was established, he finds that he’s become irrelevant, with younger and more capable fighters joining to overshadow him.  His rank is low amongst his co-workers, nobody ever buys his merchandise, and to make matters worse, a new superhero named Barnaby Brooks has thrown his hat into the ring, sporting the exact same power that Kotetsu has...  And to keep himself from getting fired, he has to take up a new mantle as this rookie’s partner!<br />
<br />
At first glance, Tiger and Bunny seems to have one of the most tired premises in recent anime history...  That is to say, a large cast of both heroes and villains who’ve mysteriously developed their own unique powers.  Just off the top of my head, I can name several titles with that exact same premise...  Darker than Black, the Index Franchise, Canaan, S-CRY-ED, Speed Grapher, and Getbackers, to name a few.  And that view point isn’t completely unfair, since the array of powers it features is probably the least imaginative in the bunch.  <br />
<br />
But where Tiger and Bunny differs from these other shows is in it’s core concept, which is essentially an amusing combination of X-Men and Nascar.  The heroes are sponsored and basically controlled by wealthy real-life corporations, who tell them how to act and dress while decorating their costume with different logos.  They advertise these logos by competing on Hero TV, earning points based on just how successful their defense of the city was that season.  I can honestly say I’ve never seen an idea even close to that one in my entire life.<br />
<br />
The animation was produced by a company named Sunrise, a prolific animation studio with a lot of very impressive previous work under their belt.  They’re known by fans as Sunrise Smooth, a reference to the fluidity of most of their efforts.  Unfortunately, the same can’t really be said for Tiger and Bunny.  It uses both 3D and 2D style animation, but it doesn’t blend them...  The 3D is used in action scenes, or just whenever the heroes are in costume, and the 2D is used practically everywhere else.  <br />
<br />
The 3D animation is actually very impressive, and yes, very smooth.  It turns just about every action scene into a pulse pounding, exciting thrill ride that it should be.  Unfortunately, the 3D is still in effect when our heroes are wearing their costumes outside of action, as well...  Whether they’re giving an interview, lounging around the company gym, or just interacting with one another, and at times, this can sometimes look really...  Really...  Awkward.  It’s mostly due to the fact that with so much money going into the 3D animation, the regular animation obviously took a huge budget cut.  With this side of the coin, we get some of the cheapest looking animation I’ve ever encountered, from hideous walk cycles to the heavy abuse of key frames.  Seeing that in the background, the three dimensional characters look out of place to an almost creepy degree.<br />
<br />
The artwork, however, almost completely makes up for it.  This show is set in a fictional American city, and as such, the art and character designs have a very surprising western aesthetic to them.  Aside from a few wide-eyed children, the characters almost always look more like American comic book characters than anime characters.  I’m serious, too...  Virtually every single frame of this show looks like it could have been taken directly from a Marvel or DC comic book, which is a touch that makes the sometimes stiff animation a lot more palatable.  The backgrounds, too, are highly detailed, and the bustling metropolis known as Stern Bild looks like a dead ringer for a futuristic New York City.  The architecture of this setting is beautiful and imaginative, even if some of the structures look entirely implausible in  design.  <br />
<br />
The characters inhabiting this city, much like they would be in real life, are racially diverse, forming a shockingly progressive melting pot with nary a stereotype in sight.  Normally, if I were watching an anime that featured White, Black, Hispanic, Russian, Japanese and especially Chinese characters, I would be on the edge of my seat waiting for something offensive to happen.  But aside from a few exaggerated physical traits...  Nope!  Every character’s given a proportionate amount of respect, with their ethnic backgrounds never even slightly becoming an issue in the story.<br />
<br />
Well, that is, except for the gay character.  Granted, he’s cool and likeable, and I appreciate that they made him the only hero rich enough to own his own sponsor company, but the homophobia in his design is still pretty blatant.  He talks in a throaty, effeminate falsetto and flirts with pretty much every other male character in the show...  Especially Kotetsu, who already has the barely clad Blue Rose inexplicably pining for him.  If you were to create a sliding scale that ranked all of the LGBT characters in anime history in terms of how offensive they were, he’d be somewhere close to the crossdresser from the Battle Royal manga.  It’s a disappointing step backward for a series that’s otherwise been able to take two giant steps forward against the abundant racial homogeny of the anime medium.<br />
<br />
Ironically, though, if this show were ever adapted into live action, there’s no doubt in my mind that every single character would be Japanese.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters?  Well, the main focus of the series is on the ups and downs of Kotetsu and Barnaby’s partnership, so several of the main characters got the short end of the screen time stick.  Characters like Dragon Kid and Origami Cyclone are barely featured outside of having an episode each to themselves, and Rock Bison doesn’t even really get that much.  Fire Emblem, Blue Rose and Sky High get a bit more than that, but they all still play supporting roles to our two mains and their families.  <br />
<br />
Thankfully, it wasn’t for nothing...  The titular characters are fleshed out, interesting, and very well developed.  Kotetsu, or Wild Tiger as he’s publicly known, is very thoroughly portrayed as the aging veteran trying his damnedest to keep up with new ideas and techniques while still holding on to his more traditional values by the skin of his teeth.  As altruistic as he may be, he’s a very flawed character, who refuses to let anybody ever worry about him...  This stubborn attitude causes strain in both his professional and personal life, as he has a lot of trouble connecting not only with his partner but also with his ten year old daughter.  Despite his insistence that saving people is more important than earning points or selling merchandise, he still clearly cares about his placement in the rankings.  This could make a lot of leading men unlikeable, but in Tiger’s case, it just serves to make him more sympathetic.<br />
<br />
His partner, Barnaby Brooks Junior...  Or Bunny, as Kotetsu irritatingly came up with...  Is in many ways the exact opposite.  He’s the newest super hero on the circuit, and he rejects a lot of the older notions to the point that he doesn’t even bother keeping his identity a secret.  He fights with his head rather than his heart, preferring logical strategy to Kotetsu’s bold, gallant approach.  He’s very direct with people, to the point where he jumps to conclusions at all the worst times.  His tragic past is your typical ‘Batman’s parents’ story, but the way it’s portrayed...  And the way it shaped his views on justice... is so genuine that you can’t help rooting for him.<br />
<br />
They clash a lot in the beginning, working together solely out of the interest of their employment, but as time goes on they do become closer, and they stop having to pretend to be friends.  This development is shown very naturally throughout the series, and it doesn’t hurt that it’s portrayed through the outstanding, flawless performances of Wally Wingert and Yuri Lowenthal.  The entire dub is very well cast, with nearly all of the actors melting seamlessly and in some cases unrecognizably into their roles, but it’s the main duo by far that takes the cake.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is the part where I have to talk about the writing, and it’s not a part that I’m really looking forward to.  The story in Tiger and Bunny is fast paced, well executed, and hits all the right notes, with exciting CG battles, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and just enough down time to let us form attachments to almost all of the main characters...  Even the ones that don’t get a lot of screen time.  However, that story wouldn’t have progressed at all without the help of inexplicably childish behavior, constant coincidences that directly challenge the suspension of disbelief, and foreshadowing so clumsily handled that a lot of the more serious plot twists can be seen coming from a mile away.  <br />
<br />
There are dozens of conflicts and mysteries that could easily be solved in ways that the viewer will often wind up SHOUTING at the screen, and it almost feels insulting when the answers you come up with are put into play at the last moment for dramatic effect.  Yes, timing is important in a story, but even Dora the Explorer doesn’t make the audience shout out obvious answers as often as Tiger and Bunny does.  Hell, some of the villains are so obviously villains that they might as well have had the last name Palpatine.  Early in the first few episodes, an astute viewer may start wondering things about the nature of Hero TV, ultimately coming to a conclusion that just has to be, and of course winds up being, one of the biggest reveals of the series.<br />
<br />
And that’s to say nothing about the lack of originality at play.  While the two titular characters and the final villain have some interesting and unique abilities, there doesn’t seem to be an original idea in the bunch.  Most of the heroic supporting characters have commonplace powers that manipulate ice, fire, lightning, and wind.  There are also powers based on Colossus, Morph, and a lighter version of Rogue from the Xmen.  As far as the villains go, you’ll find characters who’re based on Emma Frost(Or more likely the diamond woman from Speed Grapher), Sandman, The Hood, and others.  Even when you put Kotetsu and Barnaby’s powers aside, the Iron Man suits they wear are just that...  Iron Man suits.<br />
<br />
While the vigilante Lunatic may have a somewhat original power, think about this;  He’s a judge who experienced emotional trauma as a kid, and grew up believing all evil doers must be killed...  And he uses his powers to do just that, murdering the wicked while criticizing those who let them live.  He’s basically Teru Mikami, except that he has the long white hair and shady face that have become trademarks of any obvious villain.  And by comparison, he’s actually one of the better villains in the series...  He’s nowhere near as obvious as the main villain, whose convoluted master plan and backstory turn the entire final story arc into a rat-king sized clusterfuck of plotholes that had me more confused than excited.  It’s actually kind of amazing.<br />
 <br />
Tiger and Bunny was dubbed and released stateside by Viz Media, and is reasonably priced both online and on common store shelves.  Two films have also been released in the following years, but in typical anime fashion, they’re just slightly altered retellings of the series.  In other words, they’re full fledged cash grabs.  I haven’t seen them myself, but apparently the first one is available stateside, undubbed, and also fairly cheap.  <br />
<br />
For the most part, I really enjoyed it.  I connected instantly with Wild Tiger, as his story was undoubtedly and very effectively the heart and soul of the series.  It’s a really fun story, with an intriguing idea, great comedy, and it has a highly diverse cast of likeable characters.  It’s not very original, but it’s sincere, and it’s clear that some very real heart went into it’s creation.  It looks beautiful when it tries, but it doesn’t try often enough.  It’s also heavily flawed below the surface, and there’s a lot of points where you have to turn off your brain to fully enjoy it...  I don’t like doing that, so there were a lot of times where I just felt alienated from the fun that I should have been having.  But to it’s credit, the story is so engrossing that those problems didn’t really bother me as much until my second viewing, and even then, there’s still a lot to love about it.  It’s an enthusiastic love letter to American comic book lore, and it damn well feels like it.  I give Tiger and Bunny a 7/10.

    Alright, it&#039;s time for a new season and there&#039;s a chance that Sunrise is gonna make it a good one with this gem. Of course, Sunrise is probably the most incompetent major studio when it comes to handling a story and has been for years, but I&#039;m willing to put my hopes and dreams for anime&#039;s future on the line for Tiger&amp;Bunny. <br />
<br />
The premise: Superheroes are real, and they&#039;re the latest and greatest tool for capitalism. Anyone who&#039;s anyone that has a superpower is sponsored by a company, and they all compete on a reality TV show where they catch crooks and stop disasters from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35646">
        happening. Their catch phrases, names, costumes and everything else about the heroes are a corporate product designed to sell merchandise and stuff. <br />
<br />
Behind all this is our boy Kotetsu, an idealistic aging superhero who calls himself Wild Tiger. He&#039;s not cool anymore. His merchandise isn&#039;t selling, his sponsor&#039;s the victim of a corporate takeover and there&#039;s a new kid on the block with the exact same powers as him. The kicker is that he&#039;s been paired up with this new guy due to a new corporate deal and has to work with him on a daily basis. He also has a wife who&#039;s either dead or divorced and a daughter that he doesn&#039;t live with, opting instead for a semi-fancy apartment lined with empty booze bottles. The other heroes he works with are also real people, who have their own lives and takes on their situation.<br />
<br />
Like his superstar partner, Barnaby. Bunny-boy&#039;s a dead-serious realist who&#039;s all about efficiency, but still has lots of charisma and can lose his temper from time to time. His dynamic with Kotetsu is pulled off very believably. At the start, they both definitely have their issues with one another, but it becomes unclear who&#039;s really being the difficult one in the relationship. Their development and characterization is handled very well, with personalities and actions that change and interact believably in a well-paced manner.<br />
<br />
The backstories behind these characters have all been enjoyable and unique so far. Everyone faces issues involving things like friends, family, uncertainties for their futures, self confidence, money, etc. You know, really relate-able things. Melodrama that we&#039;re all used to seeing in anime has been pretty sparse, and when it has popped up it&#039;s been handled professionally. T&amp;B is very much a character driven series, and it knows what it&#039;s doing.<br />
<br />
Visually, the show is pretty cool. People will bitch about the CGI used for some of the superheroes, but those are usually the same people who find great interest in anime like A-Channel, where the style is so banal that they don&#039;t even have to think about whether it&#039;s good or not. In terms of art design, the heroes remind me of a Ultraman/Marvel/Ultimate Muscle/Karas mix, which is neat. You get a good meld of Western comics and Eastern Tatsunoko. The animation and CGI themselves are just dandy, every motion is smooth and the art is crisp with no &quot;QUALITY&quot; in sight, and has maintained that level of goodness for a third of the series now.<br />
<br />
The writing for the show is great, and delivers campy fun and a mature character-driven story to back it up. Dialogue is witty and engaging. The humor is actually funny and doesn&#039;t rely on outrageous visual gags, ecchi or references to Japan&#039;s asinine culture. The drama feels real and relate-able, especially in the later episodes, and doesn&#039;t rely on contrived nonsense, but rather on human emotion and conflict. The pacing for the episodes is wonderful, and even the parts without the CGI heroes jumping around had me interested and entertained. Each episode delivers a solid 23 minutes of content, with no meaningless filler or superfluous action. They&#039;re all put together very well. The series pacing as a whole has been fairly smooth, and even during the introduction episodes I felt like the show was going somewhere. Every episode develops the characters or background by a lot, this is a show that doesn&#039;t waste the viewer&#039;s time.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I&#039;ve seen some complaints about the &quot;lack of action&quot;, which I can&#039;t do anything but shake my head at. I guess I have to keep reminding myself that we live in a world where wanton garbage takes precedence over originality and good execution, both of which this show has. I highly recommend it if you like those sort of things.

    I really hate it when a potentially fun premise finds itself eventually getting bogged down by the conventional elements it was seemingly trying to subvert. Tiger and Bunny&#039;s premise was unique in the fact you had superheroes on a reality show competing for points and being corporate-sponsored, which had me thinking this series would get its fun off exploiting the premise and poking fun of the absurdities commonplace with superhero formulas when I first heard about it. Instead, it creates plot development out of Kotetsu and Barnaby getting used to each other as a superhero duo when the former&#039;s company gets bought out and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43605">
        two running into developments involving a vigilante hero and a crime organization. The series does decently flesh out both characters as the show prominently focuses on both of them and we get to learn what drove both men into becoming heroes. It also introduces some decent ideas explored such as said vigilante hero in the form of Lunatic and the idea of superheroes losing their powers, as what happens to a major character in the second half to Tiger and Bunny.<br />
<br />
In terms of visuals, Tiger and Bunny is easily one of the better-looking titles to come out for the year thus far sporting plenty of detail and color to go along with the vast environments shown through the city landscapes of Sternbild City. This same high-quality also went into creating the character designs as the costumes of the heroes are slick to look at, especially the costumes worn by Kotetsu and Barnaby. Action scenes are fluid to look at and get fairly diverse as there are chase scenes by foot and motorcycle, aerial fights and hand-to-hand combat.<br />
<br />
However, Tiger and Bunny finds itself getting bogged down quite a bit by its conventional elements which make it almost seem like a cookie-cutter shounen anime. A number of the characters are tacked on with an archetype that has been done to death in typical plot setups such as Kotetsu being the slow-witted and impulsive hero of the series, Fire Emblem your stereotypical gay man and Blue Rose a tsundere. The show also gets into the annoying habit of resorting to contrived plot developments or conveniently ditching certain points of the plot to help advance any major plot developments that the Heroes are caught up in, particularly with its major baddies in both halves of the show. I couldn&#039;t help but wonder the number of times the show resorted to deus ex machina just to force the plot into a certain direction without making sense of things, especially when the Heroes were put into situations where they were seemingly on the losing end of fights as they fought against villains who were either too powerful to be defeated easily or developed an elaborate plot that fell apart due to contrived developments. Both major plots had their potential yet the series fails to provide a solid resolution to both because things get too messy and/or cliched in their developments towards the final moments of both arcs.<br />
<br />
Overall, Tiger and Bunny had its potential yet fell flat due to it not escaping the more conventional elements that get tossed into its path. While still having some decent ideas it explores and having its moments in developments with Barnaby and Kotetsu, it still made for a fairly mediocre watch for me and I imagine enough folks will be eating up the news of the series having a sequel planned in the works.

    When I first saw this anime, I thought I wouldn&#039;t like it. This isn&#039;t the type of art I like and action superheroes are not my thing. That was my initial impression until my friend had highly recommend it. You definitely have to push through the first episode if you do not like episodic battle anime. The story will get better and you will have your darker plot!<br />
<br />
The art needs getting use to, I guess it is not very traditional. I can&#039;t remember the sound but I like the opening.<br />
<br />
What I love about this story.. ohh the characters. There are so many hidden facets and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100231">
        the characters are developed quite well (no one dimensional characters here). <br />
<br />
This may not be that appealing to people looking for a romantic anime (there isn&#039;t much) but if you are looking for x-men themes  like superhero woes and supervillains motivations, you won&#039;t be disappointed.

    Tiger &amp; Bunny is definitely not your average action anime. Actually, it is more akin western superhero comics than to the shounen and seisen that make up most action anime. From the comic-bookish hero costumes to the loose and fun atmosphere, this very much like the Saturday morning cartoons western audiences grew up on... except better. It&#039;s a breath of fresh air and welcomed diversity in the world of anime, but more than that, it&#039;s a damn fun show.<br />
<br />
Right from the start, Tiger &amp; Bunny sets itself apart from just about any other show with its &#039;superheroes meet capitalism&#039; premise. You see, in the city

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44015">
        of Sternbild, being a superhero has become a profitable enterprise. Hero TV, a show that follows heroes as they fight crime, is the most popular thing on television; not only are heroes beacons of justice, they&#039;re celebrities, not to mention corporate cash-cows. But all that doesn&#039;t matter to Kotetsu T. Kaburagi (a.k.a Wild Tiger), an old-time veteran of Hero TV, he&#039;s just in it to be a hero. However, his popularity has dropped, and before he knows it the company he works under goes out of business and he has a new employer. What&#039;s more, he is going to be part of Sternbild&#039;s first hero duo; partnered up with the arrogant and glory-seeking new hot-shot, Barnaby Brooks. This idea feels fresh, unique, and is brimming with potential.<br />
<br />
With this premise, Tiger &amp; Bunny could have focused on capitalistic greed and corruption, but instead opts to be a story about friendship and heroism with a capitalistic backdrop, and this makes it infinitely more inviting. The show is filled with heart-pounding action, colorful characters, and has tongue-in-cheek atmosphere which all make it a roaring good time. Later, some intrigue gets thrown in with the tragedy of Barnaby&#039;s past and introduction of the super secretive crime syndicate, Ouroboros. And let&#039;s not forget Lunatic, the violent vigilantly who has a very different idea of justice. This all comes together to make Tiger &amp; Bunny&#039;s first half a high-spirited superhero romp.<br />
<br />
Coming into its second half, Tiger &amp; Bunny shifts gears a bit. The second half has heavier emphasis on drama than the first, as Kotetsu, and later Barnaby, struggle with the life-style they have chosen because of forces beyond their control. Now, you&#039;d think that this shift in dynamic would be cripplingly tone-dissident to the show until that point but surprisingly it isn&#039;t. This is in no small part due to the fantastic lead the show has in Kotetsu, and never loses its tongue-in-cheek charm even as it ramps up the drama. Kotetsu character shines here (even more than it already has), and his struggle between life as a hero and life with his daughter aims straight for the viewers&#039; hearts. Barnaby&#039;s part is more melodramatic, but at the same time drives the plot forward, keeping the audience wanting to know what&#039;s next. The plot thickens with every episode, revealing unsavory truths about Hero TV, but at the same time never really loses its sense of fun, and once the clouds clear, Tiger &amp; Bunny is the awesome superhero romp it always has been.<br />
<br />
The shows cast is, for the most part, extremely likable. First and foremost there is Kotetsu, who is one of the most endearing lead characters in recent memory. He&#039;s a big goof and makes plenty of mistakes often coming off as an overgrown kid, but at the same time has a strong sense of right and wrong which makes it easy to stand behind him, and is incredibly charming in his own doofy way. His relationship with his daughter, Kaede, also provide the show with its biggest emotional punches. Barnaby is definitely not on the same level as his partner, simply lacking the charisma Kotetsu has, but serves the role as Kotetsu&#039;s foil well. All the heroes have their own distinctive traits which make them charming, whether it be Sky High&#039;s enthusiasm, Dragon Kid being a bit of a tomboy, or Blue Rose&#039;s crush on Kotetsu; they all also share a nice sense of comradery with one another which really makes you care bout them. Then of course, there is the anti-hero vigilante Lunatic and other antagonists like the Social-Darwinist Jake, who just bleed super-villain charisma. Unfortunately, the characters do have their short-comings, as most lack substantial depth which does cause problems for the series.<br />
<br />
On the technical-side, Tiger &amp; Bunny looks and sounds great. Character designs are stylish and attractive, especially the superhero costumes, and the city of Sternbild is a booming, well-detailed metropolis. Of special note is the show&#039;s use of CG. Now, CG integration is kind of tricky because you want it to pop out, but not feel out of place; this is something that Tiger &amp; Bunny does exceptionally well. The CG is noticeable but not distracting, and feels right at home amongst the vibrant streets of Sternbuild. The music is well composed and really pumps up the excitement. It really gets your blood pumping to hear the music while the heroes zoom around the city or are locked in battle. The show also uses its musical ques well, so you know when Lunatic is going to make an appearance, or when epic heroics are going to ensue.<br />
<br />
With all that said, the show is not without some glaring flaws. For one, there is a gigantic number of plot conveniences in the story. Plot points will often be brought up, then pushed aside for a while until the story conveniently uses them to explain or trigger certain events. Many of these are also rather silly. The tongue-in-cheek nature of the show is enough to cover for this and makes it forgivable for the most part, but still the story is hard to take seriously sometimes. Less forgivable is the fact that the show almost solely relies on Kotetsu for emotional impact. Barnaby isn&#039;t the most likeable of characters, and some of the dramatic moments of his story feel overwrought. While all the other characters get fleshed out a bit, it isn&#039;t enough to make the viewers truly resonate with them emotionally. The only one to really emotionally grab onto is Kotetsu, and while that works just fine for the show, most of the characters feel unfulfilled because of this.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what flaws it may have, Tiger &amp; Bunny is well worth checking out. Its a show that constantly tossing up oohs and aahs, and will keep a smile on your face. Deep and thought provoking this is not, but when a show is this fun, being goofy and explosive works just as well.<br />

    Coming in as a Western anime fan it is hard to not be skeptical of an anime about superheroes. Considering our own comic book industry and how it contrasts to anime in general, I almost would never consider the possibility of an anime successfully capturing the world of superheroes. Perhaps this is why I consider Tiger &amp; Bunny to be one of the most pleasant surprises I have seen in quite a while.<br />
<br />
Tiger &amp; Bunny is a story about corporate sponsored superheroes called &quot;Next&quot;, essentially mutants like those of X Men, who are constantly filmed on television in Sternbuild City. By engaging in heroic acts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43617">
        the superheroes are given points in a contest to determine who the &quot;King of Heroes&quot; is, and by doing better in the competition the heroes provide better advertising for their sponsors.<br />
<br />
The premise of the story lends itself to an interesting twist on superhero ideals. This is best represented by our two main characters Kotetsu who is known as the superhero Wild Tiger, and Barnaby, who Kotetsu nicknames Bunny. Kotetsu starts out the show as an old and washed up hero who believes in superhero ideals that are considered old fashioned by his peers. He values justice above all else, makes saving people his top priority, and could care less about what the sponsors want.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we have Barnaby, or Bunny, who got into the hero business as an avenger seeking justice for his parents&#039; death. At the start he only really cares about earning points in the hero competition, and doesn&#039;t place that much importance on Kotetsu&#039;s old fashioned ideas, and does everything to appease all the sponsors. The partnership that Barnaby would form with Kotetsu, Tiger &amp; Bunny, would go on to be the defining relationship of the show. Their clash of ideals would lead both on to balancing each other out, as well as serve as one of the most amusing sources of comedy throughout the entire show&#039;s run.<br />
<br />
It should be stressed that Tiger &amp; Bunny, while not afraid to get serious at times, is overall a very fun and entertaining story about superheroes. The character interactions and development are often very amusing, and the world is built up magnificently. While also having nice action scenes throughout the story, Tiger &amp; Bunny&#039;s greatest strength would definitely have to be its character building. As a great character driven story, the cast ends up being very likable and well made.<br />
<br />
Another remarkable aspect of this show is its seamless ability to blend Western superheros into the world of anime. The costume and abilities of Kotetsu as Wild Tiger are all too familiar of more Western heroes, as are the villains like Jake Martinez who capture the Western psychopathic antagonist really well. I give the show a lot of praise because of its ability to connect to me as a Western fan, especially when so many animes are so confined in the Japenese markets.<br />
<br />
Overall, the show just manages to be a fun, and adventurous tale. It is one of the least offensive shows out there, and can be recommended to almost anyone. This show is perfect for anyone who gives a damn about superheroes, but is also compelling enough for almost anyone to enjoy. I hope to see more anime like this in the future.

    Hi, and thanks for taking the time to read my review of Tiger &amp; Bunny! I have come to terms that I am obsessed with this show, and I&#039;d like more people to give it a chance.<br />
<br />
Story: I&#039;d say the biggest letdown is the story; the main plot has been done before. On the plus side, there is considerable effort put into the side characters&#039; stories that helps add to the overarching plot. <br />
<br />
Art: Another iffy spot. At times, the art is gorgeous. Other times, the art is very simplistic and &quot;lazy&quot;. I think that the CG implemented into the show is a bonus, rather

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84393">
        than a hindrance. While it is noticeable, it is well-done and very smooth.<br />
<br />
Sound: I&#039;ve watched both the dub and sub, and I love them both. Every character has the perfect voice actor attributed to them. The background music was hit-or-miss. Most of the themes are great, and have a very 40&#039;s jazz / golden age feel to them. Akin to the music of Pixar&#039;s The Incredibles.<br />
<br />
Character: The reason I fell in love with this show. Everything from the designs to the personalities is spot-on. While Kotetsu is my favorite, it is very hard to pick a second favorite, or even least favorite character. Almost every character goes through noticeable development, and they become even more endearing.<br />
<br />
Overall: A decent story backed by an incredible cast of characters and diverse themes. The show is equal parts action, drama, emotion (I connected with Kotetsu&#039;s storyline a lot) and comedy. <br />
<br />
TL;DR 5 words/phrases to desribe Tiger &amp; Bunny<br />
<br />
great characters, funny, emotional, good action, hot men :)

    -Expect the unexpected<br />
<br />
Surely we have a lot of anime series that gave us excitement on twisting what already is twisted from their stories and I&#039;d say Tiger and Bunny is a one great example of it all.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10<br />
Well, I love the characters and though there will always be those common(or usual) traits you&#039;d find similar in other anime series, characters in Tiger and Bunny will surely leave a mark on you specially the two main characters Kotetsu and Barnaby. They may have the cat and dog relationship but they executed their conflicting attitudes in a lighter way that the audience won&#039;t find annoying or tiring

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44277">
        to see over and over again. The other heroes as well have different behaviors towards each other but when united goes with a nice mix of teasing and fun.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves establishes the idea that anyone can be a hero as long as they have the passion to do so and speaking of passion there is also Agnes and his cameraman who will always be passionate on their job of getting higher ratings and is always on the go with adding spice to the anime.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
The art is really great, I love how the characters were drawn and it was actually their appearance that made me watch the anime at first thinking, I like the art and how it&#039;s mixed with lil 3d effects specially the colors incorporated with the heroes. I totally love Kotetsu and Barnaby&#039;s art with AND without their cool suits.<br />
<br />
Music 8/10<br />
All the music used(specially ot &amp; et)goes well with the whole series though they are not the kind of OST you&#039;d love putting on your ipod to play again and again, nevertheless, It wasn&#039;t so great but not a let down either.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
I&#039;m not into action genre because I&#039;m an adventure and horror freak watcher and I honestly thought that Tiger and Bunny is a mecha-anime series but thank god I know how to read reviews, synopsis and information that I decided to give it a try. If you&#039;re looking for an anime worth the watch and knows how to tickle you here and there while filling you up with tons of action scenes then this series have all the qualities not to be missed out.<br />
<br />
Watching the anime didn&#039;t disappoint me one bit and I&#039;m totally satisfied to have seen such a great series after a long time. ^__^<br />

    Out of all the shows to debut for the Spring 2011 season, Tiger and Bunny was the only I had the most reservations about prior the actually seeing it. The description was non existent and the cover art made it look like some sort of yaoi mecha anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m please to say that none of the above is true. The show is pretty awesome after two episode. The premise is a buncha of random people got super powers and some use them for good, others evil, but someone decided to cash in on this and now their exploits are set up on public television. <br />
<br />
The show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36135">
        does have massive product placement, I mean BANDI and PEPSI and such flash all over the screen everywhere. In any other anime I&#039;d drop it because of this, but it&#039;s almost amusing considering the backdrop. <br />
<br />
T&amp;B has a large lineup of characters/heroes, but the titular ones, Tiger and Bunny are already looking like they&#039;ll have strong development just based on the first two episode. Wild Tiger, a passed his prime hero who believes a heroes duty is to do what is right, no matter what, is often at odds with his counterpart, Barney (bunny) who seems more considered with a level headed and calculated approach. <br />
<br />
The anime seems a lot less focused on any form of super villain, or any type of villain, and more so on the conflicts of Tiger and Bunny themselves. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll be like an evil force in the works for later, but right now the plot progression is more of a personal journey for the characters instead of a point a to point b type of routine. <br />
<br />
Verdict:<br />
<br />
Watch. There is no reason not to pick this up and give it a try.

    Tiger and bunny I remember seeing ads for this show on youtube thinking &quot;Wow this looks like a complete sell out anime&quot; So I never gave it a try till I saw japan rated this anime rank 6th, 2nd and 1st place on all time anime. I was shocked so I turned I  on ep 1 expecting to hate it and I ended up watching 14 eps in a single day loving it...... Never judge a book by it&#039;s cover  <br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is about heroes saving the day but on a tv show to get points yep every time they save someone or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295336">
        beat the bad guy they get points the more points they get the more popular they are the better deals they get. The only hero who doesn&#039;t care about that though is tiger one of the main characters whose power is &quot;100 times&quot; which makes him stronger for 5 mins and he&#039;s been a hero for 10 years. Unfortunately he&#039;s one of the least popular heroes so he ends up getting a  partner who has the same powers as him. <br />
<br />
Art <br />
The is is pretty good but one thing does hold it back is the 3D it looks fine on the heros who wear armor but heros like fire emblem look awful cause he wears normal leather hero costume showing his mouth which confused me cause Dragon Kid and Blue Rose are 2D so it&#039;s really odd<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The music and voicing acting are great I think op 1 of the show really has a good song <br />
<br />
Character<br />
The characters are developed pretty well and are very likable I wanted to see more every ep with them <br />
<br />
 Enjoyment <br />
I had a blast watching this and even ended up watching the first and second movie right after I was done the anime <br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I really recommend this anime it&#039;s fun watch <br />

    In this day and age, I have often resigned myself into thinking that an anime, no matter the explosive and exciting start it has, will always fail to live up with the hype and expectation at the very end due to the virtue of just being an anime, since to a lot of titles(such as Code Geass S2, Guilty Crown, Valverave, etc.), having a trainwreck of a plot has totally become a standard. Rarely does an anime stay solid, explosive and exciting from beginning to end like Tiger &amp; Bunny, and I will go as far as to say that it is one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135641">
        best anime ever made in the last decade.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
Tiger &amp; Bunny is pretty much the usual superhero fare, with the protagonist duo embodying the usual red and blue, on red you have Kaburagi Kotetsu, the hotblooded, naive and passionate hero who tends to be the leap-before-he-looks kind of character, on the other is the cool and calculated Barnaby Brooks, Jr, the type of hero who tends to do his job as a hero as perfectly as possible. It&#039;s a dynamic we have seen almost everywhere in the Superhero staple, the twist here is like Captain Amazing in the movie Mystery Men, each superhero has sponsors, and their exploits are televised, and Kaburagi Kotetsu(who is under the name &quot;Wild Tiger&quot;, the &quot;Crusher of Justice&quot;) has to weigh the choices of whether he should be obeying his sponsors to make rescues and arrests look sensational and flashy or follow his superhero ideals wherein he has to do whatever is necessary to save people. Along with Wild Tiger and Barnaby Brooks Jr., the story also tackles the backstory of other superheroes as well and how their lives are no different from normal people, except for, y&#039;know, them being superheroes.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The visuals in this anime is delicious to watch, the CGI is amazing, so good to the point that it gives high budget visual anime such as Karas a run for its money. The superhero designs are cool as well. Wild Tiger and Barnaby&#039;s outfits look radical, and their tag team sequences never fail to keep my adrenaline running. I wouldn&#039;t even complain about their sponsors being in their outfits, it all fits seamlessly. Arguably though, my favorite here in terms of costumes has to be Sky High, his outfit just looks glorious. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
You may have seen me mention Karas in terms of costumes and CGI earlier, and the influence of Karas can be seen all throughout the entire series, one is featured prominently on the second arc alone. Same goes with the soundtrack, the soundtrack is highly reminiscent to Karas&#039; Soundtrack mainly due to the fact that they employed the same person(Both anime have their soundtracks composed by Yoshihiro Ike) for it, and bloody hell they sure picked the right man for the job. Each track that plays in the series just oozes with badassery and heroism, from Wild Tiger&#039;s Power To The Future to Lunatic&#039;s Voice of Thanatos, each tracks deliver their theme way too perfectly.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
What makes Tiger &amp; Bunny unique and fun is that for an anime with a simple premise, it&#039;s very well-written and well-executed, to the point that when you do see live ads in the anime, it doesn&#039;t feel forced or shoehorned in at all, each thing in the anime is there because the plot needs them to be there, it&#039;s not as blatantly offensive as Pizza Hut&#039;s portrayal in Code Geass, or Häagen-Dazs in Yuru Yuri and Kara no Kyoukai. The anime is sincere in its attempt to tell an amazing story, lastly, not only is it about superheroes, but it&#039;s an anime about friendship and teamwork, and I wouldn&#039;t take it any other way.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Ten across the board, every anime should be as sincere as Tiger &amp; Bunny. Rating it a nine is a slight disservice. I would gladly add this to my list of reasons as to why anime is worth defending, and I believe that you should do the same.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor, drop whatever you&#039;re doing and watch this show, you won&#039;t find something as good as this anytime soon.

    I know another Tiger and Bunny Review when there is so many other great reviews. But I really wanted to say, or rather type, why I loved this show. And how it is the only 2011 anime that I have kept updated with constantly. <br />
<br />
First let&#039;s start with the Story. <br />
<br />
When you look at the title its a little off putting, but honestly the title is what drove me to try this series. An anime called Tiger and Bunny with a cover picture of Mecha suits. It raises the curiosity.  So I tired it. And I was surprised. It was funny and the art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43099">
        was pretty neat (CGI is a little hard to get use to at first but I find that you eventually get use to it). Then the show really started. Episodes that seemed &quot;filler&quot; like, weren&#039;t. And it was brilliant. My only real issue with the story is that at times I found it to be predictable which didn&#039;t bother me to much, because if I wanted a serious anime I would&#039;ve watch Code Geass, Deadman Wonderland, or something like Durarara!!. The story is well written and parts where it seems unimportant come back and become well, important. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier the art is hard to get use to with the mix of CGI and anime-style. But eventually you get use to it and then it works. I think if the CGI wasn&#039;t in Tiger and Bunny, I wouldn&#039;t have kept coming back. The CGI makes it Tiger and Bunny (or rather the art of TnB) It adds to its overall quirkiness.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
I love the music for TnB. The second ending I listen to over and over. And when I watch the anime every Saturday I find myself not skipping the openings and endings like I normally do. Once you seem them its good enough. But the soundtrack is just amazing. Even the instrumentals in the backgrounds work so well. When they planned this show they didn&#039;t skimp out on small things, or the bkgd music. <br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
TnB&#039;s characters are amazingly brilliant. Kotetsu (MC) is your usual hero. Believes completely in justice and human lives and he can be a ditz at times. What makes his character better than every other one is his age. And the fact he is a father. Then you have Burnaby, that character you dislike in the beginning but grow to love by the end. His development through the story is well-written. Even the other characters and the way the interact with each other was well thought out. Each character has their story (except seemingly not Rock Bison (Idek what his NEXT is)) that affects the original storyline. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
I love anime and I love following it. And when a new anime comes out I try to follow it weekly but it is difficult with life. This show is the only one I have tried to follow every week (airs on Saturday). And every Saturday I feel so sad because it means that I can&#039;t watch it for another week. TnB will hook you. The characters, the art, the sound, the story it all leaves you wanting more Tiger and more Bunny. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would love for this anime to be sold in North America so that I can buy it and watch it over and over and show all my friends. I would also love for it to become more popular and for people to try it out. And I would love it if you readers would give it a chance and not dismiss it because its mecha (which honestly it isn&#039;t) or that the name is childish. <br />
Tiger and Bunny is my favourite anime and I wish others would come to see why. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review and I hope you try the show out!~<br />

    Tiger &amp; Bunny is a hero series from 2011. It was brought to us by Sunrise. I&#039;ve heard it mentioned a lot over the years, but never got around to watching it. But since it&#039;s hero month, it seems like a good time to check it out and form some opinions.  <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Our narrative is set in the future where mutants... I mean &quot;Next&quot; have started popping up. Naturally, this has led to a group of heroes who wear product placements like they think they&#039;re Captain Amazing from Mystery Men and who fight criminals &amp; rescue civilians alike to earn points for a television show. Enter newcomer,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299209">
        Barnaby, a hero with a dark past he&#039;s looking to unravel. He becomes the first hero duo with veteran, Wild Tiger. Unfortunately for both of them, they don&#039;t get along all that well and Barnaby&#039;s past may be creeping up on them. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest problems with the series is that it has severe tonal issues. It tries to strike a balance between darker and lighter moments like some of the best comic runs out there including Claremont&#039;s X-men run and the Wolfman/ Pérez Titans run. The problem is that it sucks at it and there are two reasons for that. The first is that it goes two far in both directions. If you look at those comics that shift tone well, they have pretty realistic degrees on both ends. For example, The X-men facing the brood and finding themselves in a seemingly hopeless situation on account of the royal eggs that have been implanted in them but still maintaining hope and doing everything they can versus Shadowcat telling little Illyana a bed time story for an issue. In Tiger &amp; Bunny, the lighter elements cross into Silver Age goofiness. Think Batman and Superman having a slumber party at the fortress of solitude but somehow dumber whereas the darker elements cross into 90s darker and stupider territory. Which means there&#039;s a lot more of a shift between the tones. Tiger &amp; Bunny also fails because it combines the elements. If you look at those good comics, they actually transition from one tone to the other instead of abruptly forcing the tone to change. In this, they&#039;ll have goofy silver age elements, like evil plush toys piloting mechs, side by side with more serious elements like Barnaby trying to get revenge for the loss of his parents and that&#039;s just highly dissonant. <br />
<br />
Another issue is with the main villain&#039;s plan. I don&#039;t want to go deep into spoilers, so I&#039;ll keep this somewhat vague. Even though who the villain is going to be becomes really obvious as soon as our heroes have a certain conversation in hospital. In any case, our arch villain gets caught with a tiny contradiction and all he has to do to keep things from escalating is pretend he also doesn&#039;t know what the deal is. Instead he gives a huge villain speech revealing everything and tries to cover things up by messing with someone&#039;s mind. Then he makes things even worse by unnecessarily lying and trying to frame another hero. Even though said hero has had a costume where they can easily be identified just by visually comparing him with one of his old trading cards or videos. To make things even dumber, this guy supposedly wants Next to be treated well and that&#039;s why he&#039;s manipulated the Hero media but when things aren&#039;t looking so good he decides to have androids kill all the heroes that the citizens know and love even though that will clearly interfere with his big plan. I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s possible to be as egregiously stupid as this villain. <br />
<br />
Although that does lead me with yet another problem I have with this series. They bring up this idea of their mutants being feared and mistrusted a couple times, but it&#039;s not something we see any real evidence of. There are, maybe, three scenes where someone is a dick towards the Next. Other than that, they&#039;re treated like heroes, people buy their merch, big companies sponsor them to make themselves look good. There&#039;s almost nothing to indicate that things are bad for them. The series also wastes its one opportunity to do something with some impact right at the end by having a cheap cop out. So, the ending is pretty shit. The series also likes to repeat itself way too much, going over plot points to a ludicrous degree. For example, the anti-hero appears and gives a big speech about how &quot;he is doing the true justice&quot; and there are about three conversations after that where our heroes can&#039;t figure out what he&#039;s after. It&#039;s like they think their audience is really, really slow. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve already described how bad the antagonist is, so let&#039;s talk about the other major characters. Our big characters are Tiger, Kotetsu, and Barnaby. Kotetsu is a horrible, neglectful father and obnoxious cretin. Barnaby is just boring. Which is kind of the way things go in this series. At best, the heroes are trite and bland. At worst, they&#039;re gross homophobic stereotypes, Hi, Fire Emblem. Sky High is probably the most likeable of them all, even though he&#039;s dumber than a wet cardboard box, because he&#039;s a paragon character with a dog. Blue Rose is an insipid twit with a really annoying crush on a dude more than twice her age. Which might not be so bad if they didn&#039;t bring it up constantly throughout the series. <br />
<br />
Dragon Kid and Origami Cyclone are dull. Rock Bison is so boring that even his &quot;best friend&quot; can&#039;t think of any personal information to give about him. Seriously, there&#039;s a scene where Tiger is giving out some information about all the other heroes and he has nothing to say about this guy. There&#039;s also Lunatic, one of those generic anti-hero characters. Although it is worth noting that he wants to be seen as seeking true justice, but he calls himself Lunatic. That would be like Mister Sinister trying to convince ordinary people he&#039;s actually the hero while still calling himself Mister Sinister. <br />
<br />
Art: <br />
<br />
The artwork is a bit mixed. Some of the city shots look impressive, but the character designs are kind of mediocre. and the action sequences aren&#039;t very interesting. One thing that&#039;s absolutely horrendous is the product placement. The hero costumes are plastered with logos to the point of it being really tacky. It&#039;s like Sunrise just decided this had no artistic merit whatsoever so they might as well just suck off some fat corporate guys for a bit of extra dosh. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s one aspect where I can give the series some credit, the actors are pretty decent. Maybe not great, but they&#039;re about as good as they can be with characters this insipid. The best is probably Inoue Go, who does pull off the simple-minded paragon character pretty well. The only truly bad performance comes from Tsuda Kenjirou. It&#039;s not really his fault since he&#039;s voicing a super flamboyant gay stereotype, but it is awful to listen to. <br />
<br />
Ike Yoshihiro does the sound track and it&#039;s the best part of the series. They may not be the best tunes out there, but they&#039;re quite good and well put together. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
It comes entirely from our gay stereotype, who has fire powers. Wow, that isn&#039;t the least bit subtle or clever. And I&#039;m sure one person is going to say &quot;didn&#039;t you have a gay character with fire powers in Omicron Squad?&quot; Which is true but I had a lot of gay characters and Anastasia wasn&#039;t a stereotype. So, not really the same at all. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Gives the characters personality beyond tropes. One of the things that makes for a good hero comic is a strong sense of personality from the characters and well developed interpersonal dynamics among them. Plus strong villains instead of total knob heads. <br />
2. Consistent Tone. If you want something stupid and goofy like the Silver Age, just go for it. If you want something darker and stupider like an early Image comic, go for it. This clearly doesn&#039;t have a strong enough writer to pull off something between, so let&#039;s not fluctuate between those two extremes. <br />
3. A Consistent World. If you want to be like the X-men and show powered heroes doing their best in a world that hates and fears them, that&#039;s fine. If you want to have a future where everything is built up around a culture of hero worship, that&#039;s also fine. These two things do not work together. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts: <br />
<br />
Tiger &amp; Bunny is a complete mess. It can&#039;t decide which extreme tone it wants and ends up awkwardly and really badly mixing them, its heroes range from boring to obnoxious &amp; offensive. It has plot holes so massive you could fly a 747 through them. The world building is wildly inconsistent. The &quot;twists&quot; are really obvious to the point of being bland. They treat their audience like it&#039;s made up of a bunch of morons. The sponsorships are tacky as hell and it&#039;s just never interesting or entertaining. My final rating is going to be a 2/10. This anime sucks. <br />

    listen i know this show looks AWFUL and just flat out stupid but let me tell you that couldnt be farther from the truth, without a doubt this is the best show of the season. when i first saw a preview for this i though<br />
<br />
&quot;oh god, what is this crap, well thats one show ill never watch&quot;<br />
<br />
im so happy my freind talked me into watching this, this show starts off just being really fun with a very nice color pallet to it. then you realy start to love the charecters ecpecialy the MC, then you start getting tot he serious part then the villian then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37621">
        the comedy. to sum it up this show goes from entertaining to legitimently very interesting and willl keep you interested in the plot<br />
<br />
the only real con i can give about his show is the over abundance of cgi, its obviously there to save a few bucks cause when you get to more serious scene and the budget kicks in they dont use any cgi and it is realy a sight to see. but it does just make the cgi when its there more annoying, i got used to it around episode 7ish but it may bother some at the start.<br />
<br />
nmbering the criteria for this show wouldnt realy do it justice and make it seem worse than what it really is, i dont know if you trust reviews like mine but i beg you, watch this show, theres nothing like it, never will be anything like it either, this show is ery underrated becous eof idiots like me that didnt watch it cause it looked &quot;weird&quot; without even bothering to try it&quot;

    Imagine a reality show focused around X-Men-este characters saving the day in very corny and cliché ways. Now imagine that idea, but good and is actually very entertaining and has characters you seriously can&#039;t help but to cheer on, despite the corniness and clichés.<br />
<br />
STORY: Saturday morning cartoons about superheroes were awesome, but that&#039;s the past and those shows are near dead, but this anime here, this lovingly homage to those flashy costumed hero shows is quite frankly one of not only the best, but one of the most important anime created in 2011, it&#039;s one of those kind of anime while it isn&#039;t the most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49813">
        original thing ever, but the execution of its premise is executed hundred percent perfectly you&#039;d look on similar anime and find them mediocre by comparison. Sure the series is heavy on being campy and borderline silly, but it&#039;s made that way, and works, it simply works. But there&#039;s a under taste of well thought up satire beneath the goofiness along with a future that is surprisingly dark and strongly character driven.<br />
Tiger &amp; Bunny takes your average cliché super hero show and almost turns the genre on its head by including the concept of a reality game like competitive television show with a points system where all of the heroes are sponsored by real life companies (Like Bandai for example) that adds an interesting depth to this series that others fail to achieve, challenging the characters to whether or not to take the call of justice and save the day or work for a superfluous award for popularity and bragging rights. That is where the most important development for the characters lay, and it&#039;s incredibly partnered up with two very fascinating main leads, Wild Tiger and Barnaby. <br />
<br />
Tiger is one of the most realistically relatable character in anime I&#039;ve personally ever seen, a single man in his thirties (Not a god damn teenager for once!) with a daughter with realistic problems such as putting his job as a hero (This show let&#039;s me say that being a superhero is job, like an office job even, if that&#039;s not unique, I wouldn&#039;t know what it would be) on a higher ground then his family, which isn&#039;t an easy decision to do, but with his dream that is important to himself he does what he has to do to achieve it despite that he comes off as, in the start of the show, a washed up has-been, the old fogey pass his prime who just can&#039;t keep up with the more popular heroes because he doesn&#039;t care for the points or for that matter what his TV directors tell him to do because all he wants to do is save the day, or for that matter get his merchandise based on him to even get looked at on the shelves, is forced to join up with the popular new comer, Barnaby, who even has the same powers as Tiger for the world&#039;s (Of this anime) first superhero team.<br />
Opposite of Tiger, Barnaby is driven by revenge (Hold your moans and groans for a sec) to be become a superhero, he doesn&#039;t care for Tiger&#039;s old fashioned way of thinking what superheroes should be, he&#039;s out there to make himself as popular as possible, getting the points, all for the sake of his revenge, which quite frankly, is similar to popular anime. Barnaby comes off arrogant and somewhat cold, but he Tiger have an incredible chemistry that alone is entertaining to watch as they bicker and argue (Which has most of the show&#039;s comedy come forth) and their ideals clash despite that they are partners. As the show progresses, they become more understanding of each other, while they both gain equally outstanding character growth and development, yes, a revenge based character development that actually has favorable outcomes. You want to know why? Because the target(s) of revenge are developed adequately enough to be easily hated by both Barnaby and you the viewer, I guarantee that. <br />
<br />
Not only the characters Tiger and Barnaby are fleshed out to extraordinary lengths, but even the other heroes too, heck even the villains (Of course not to the point where Tiger and Barnaby are fleshed out, I mean they&#039;re the main characters, it&#039;s understandable they get the spotlight, if a series main cast has no priority development, you simply failed at making a show). Other Heroes include, Blue Rose the series, unfortunately, the real commercialized character (Pepsi anyone? No? I don&#039;t want one either) and main female character of the other heroes, she is pretty much that teenager the usual shonen action show would start with, SkyHigh, your typical boy scout of a man, who represents the typical hero of any superhero show, Origami Cyclone, the background character, literally the background character, Fire Emblem, the painfully stereotypical homosexual man with real fire power, Dragon Kid the tomboy little girl with kung fu skills paired with electricity powers, and Rock Bison, the least shown character in the series. Each of the other heroes do get their little background episode with brief development (With Blue Rose getting the most attention out of all of them) but are hardly deeper characters than respective character archetype, but along with the heroes, there&#039;s even a vigilante criminal killer, Lunatic, who even gets his own episode that completely rocks the world of Tiger&amp;Bunny to its core, after kicking off the series surprisingly much darker tone later on than what the early episodes about friendship and whatnot was going about with.<br />
But it&#039;s each characters individual quirk that get fan reaction such as &quot;We want to see more of so-and-so&quot; is what makes these characters special to the series in their own right.<br />
<br />
While plot threads like Barnaby&#039;s revenge takes many twists and turns and Tiger&#039;s later on problems with his powers keep you on the edge of your seat with baited breath for happens next, Tiger&amp;Bunny may come off as too cheesy, or too silly at times for some people, but it&#039;s that cheesiness and throwbacks to superhero shows with a satirical twist is what can keep viewers returning for more, and it helps that the core characters are interesting with satisfying developments.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION: As great as the story this is, the animation is a bit iffy relaying on mostly CG animation (Similar but fortunately done better than that Gonzo is known for) is by Sunrises least talented animation crew, but this show is one of those kind of shows where it could only take off from the ground through endorsements from other companies, not just Sunrise. <br />
During the CG scenes, the models look great, and the action scenes are well animated but the anime still falls into the category of &quot;3d on 2d&quot; so it looks awkward most of the time. While the 2d animation is fine, not terribly great, but fine either way. Character designs however, look great, very diverse, and very creative.<br />
<br />
SOUND: As for the audio department, the background music sounds exactly like your average super hero show, which works perfectly for this series. The theme music however, is a bit bland, though as a bias opinion I like Unison Square Garden and their music is good enough to me. Voice acting is good and is probably the performance that stands out is definitely Tiger&#039;s, from bickering with Barnaby to just simple dialogue, he&#039;s a treat to listen to. No English dub has yet to emerge, but a show like this will definitely benefit from one.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
The Good:<br />
+ Perfectly executed theme with a fun and exciting story to boot.<br />
+ Great lead characters, Tiger is one of the best leads in an action anime I&#039;ve seen in a good while.<br />
+ Good humor and character interaction.<br />
+ Legitimately love to hate villains.<br />
+ Decent animation, with some of the best uses of 3d animation in 2d settings.<br />
<br />
The Mixed:<br />
+/- Side characters are likable / despite that they are stereotypes.<br />
<br />
The Bad:<br />
- Not enough attention to the rest of the cast.<br />
- Might come off as too campy for some.<br />
<br />
Why is this anime one of the most important anime of 2011? Because it has the potential to bring fans into anime with power equal to what Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist had, and is hopefully the first step of anime in general to finally move forward from the current and shameful trends of the anime of today.<br />

    I wasn&#039;t going to watch this show. Nothing about the preview appealed to me in the slightest. Over the top action heros? Fighting in suits? Boring. <br />
<br />
The funny thing is, that statement is absolutey correct, and absolutely false. Yes! it is over the top action heros fighting in suits. But it isn&#039;t boring in the slightest. From the first episode I was hooked. And the reason --&gt; Kotetsu - Wild Tiger, the main character of the show. <br />
<br />
Kotetsu is thick, honest, well meaning, and one of the most endearing characters I have come across in recent times! From the start, you find yourself totally on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45867">
        his side. As others have mentioned, it is wonderful having a character who is not child/teenaged. Kotetsu is in his 30s, a dad to a 9 year old, has a kind of sensible head on his shoulders, and a penchant for destroying buildings. <br />
<br />
The other superhaeros (which the exception of Bunny) play much smaller roles, but are still given their own story arcs. And, these were enjoyable too! I have noticed in some other shows where minor characters get their moment to shine the story is weaker, but these still ran along at a cracking pace, progressed the main story AND gave the viewer insight into the smaller ones. <br />
<br />
Unusually for me - I loved the end. I absolutely loved it! It has set it up perfectly for a second season (which I would welcome with open arms) but the if there wasn&#039;t one, I would be perfectly happy with it as is. <br />
<br />
So, to summarise: charming characters, cracking pace, loads of humour, and lots of fun. I definitely reccomend Tiger and Bunny.
