    This movie is a waste of time.<br />
<br />
This is coming from someone who absolutely adores the Bungou Stray Dogs series. Needless to say, Takuya Igarashi might as well be my pallbearer so that when I die, he can let me down one last time.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with some positives--the animation was pretty good (although that&#039;s to be expected for a feature length anime film), the voice actors did their jobs well, the music, while not exactly noteworthy, was decent, and there were a few interesting elements and events relating to the protagonist that I found to be genuinely interesting. The film, however, puts them to waste with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283852">
        a confusing plot, a seizure inducing climax, and probably the dumbest and most contrived antagonist to come out of BSD.<br />
<br />
The story is about a series of (presumed to be) suicides by ability users using their own abilities. The reality is that a fog causes their abilities to manifest into this ghost of sorts that attacks their own user. Defeating this manifestation will return the original user&#039;s ability. This isn&#039;t a bad plot device in it of itself, if only it were an actual plot device at all. Instead, this predicament (which is made out to be this serious and daunting problem) serves as a mere triviality as the heroes of the movie take care of it in a matter of a few minutes, save for the main protagonist, which I&#039;ll get to later.<br />
<br />
The cause of this entire conflict is the new character that is introduced, Shibusawa Tatsuhiko. BSD&#039;s strongest point is easily the lovable and empathy inducing characters. Kafka Asagiri lovingly crafted the entire life stories of each and every single character, and it shows without even needing a tragic flashback for most of them, even making a literal PEDOPHILE likable. The fact that no character, not even the villains, are tied to the good and evil binary is one of my favorite things about the series. That said, the new villain is absolutely dreadful. His motives are unclear--he wants to die? He wants to attain the perfect ability? What in God&#039;s name does he want?! The movie shoves down your throat that this character is simply too complex a person to understand and that only two other people (Dazai &lt;3333 and Fyodor) match his wit, but from a writing standpoint, it sounds like a poor excuse. If the audience is unable to fathom the sheer complexity of a character, there&#039;s no point in having him be that complex in the first place. You cannot write a complex character if you yourself are not that complex. It&#039;s simply impossible. It&#039;s not artistic or poetic or thought provoking. It&#039;s just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
By the climax, the movie had completely lost me. With all the information being thrown at your face, it&#039;s damn near impossible to piece together what the hell is going on, much less enjoy it. The movie&#039;s lack of exposition only makes the confusion worse--none of what happens is ever explained, and none of the information from the main series explains it either. The entire time, I was thinking, &quot;Why and how is this happening? Is that even possible?&quot; The film tries to surprise you by pulling a completely unnecessary move (for the sake of not spoiling, I won&#039;t say what) that leads to no consequence whatsoever and was so obviously only included for shock value, and it didn&#039;t even do a good job because it&#039;s a freaking anime movie, and nothing that happens in anime movies ever matter or affect the main series. The final battle against Shibusawa wasn&#039;t anything interesting either; just a generic shounen mindless punchout where Atsushi believes in himself enough to defeat him. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Atsushi, his character arc was very poorly handled in the film. The anime watchers know all too well of the tragic past he&#039;s had to endure and carefully watched him move past his insecurities. So that&#039;s it right? No more of him screeching about how he isn&#039;t good enough? Nope! The movie needlessly brings back what was already resolved in the anime by making Atsushi 90% less sweet and lovable and 200% more annoying. I cannot wrap my head around why the hell they would touch this internal conflict when it was so phenomenally handled in the manga. As a matter of fact, this was a common complaint of the original anime, that Atsushi was a whiner, so why, dear God WHY would you bring it back??<br />
<br />
And lastly, the little to no screentime from the supporting cast. They were discarded as quickly as they were introduced. I would&#039;ve liked to see more of them working together for more group dynamic material like in the manga, but they were never to be seen again after the fog settled and at the very end where they pop out of nowhere to remind the audience of their existence.<br />
<br />
All in all, disappointing. I&#039;m honestly surprised at how many stellar reviews there are for this movie when picking apart would show how bad and rushed it really is. It&#039;s a shame, I was hoping they&#039;d put the money towards a third season.

    I went to see this movie on the day it came out. Despite it being 8:30 in the morning, the cinema was absolutely packed with fans (mostly young women) showing just how high the expectations were.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m happy to say it didn&#039;t disappoint, and kept me hooked from beginning to end! Although the developments are not necessarily shocking, it kept my attention for the whole movie. <br />
<br />
The movie focuses mostly on Shubusawa, Atsushi, Akutagawa, Kyoko (the real MVP), Dazai and, to a lesser extent, Chuya. If your favorite character is one of the other members of the Armed Detective Agency, please understand that they may not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275844">
        get as much screen-time as you&#039;d like, which is perfectly reasonable considering how much they tried to squeeze into the movie.<br />
<br />
The artwork is stunning, although not particularly a step-up from the TV series. The action is well-done and I absolutely loved Chuya&#039;s fighting scenes!<br />
<br />
One of the biggest highlights for me was the soundtrack. I was a big fan of the TV series OST, but the new tracks for the movie are just as good, if not better. (I was listening to the movie OST on repeat for a few days after seeing the movie...)<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed the movie to the extent that I went to see it twice. However, I do want to give a warning to all BSD fans before they give this a watch. This movie is going to tire you out. It&#039;s almost only serious conversation or action, and is very low on the comic relief. Although there are lots of little funny moments scattered here and there, they are pretty subtle. When the movie finished, the other people in the audience were saying the same thing to each other: &#039;wow, that was great but it tired me out&#039;. <br />
<br />
In general, I recommend this for all BSD fans! It&#039;s fast-paced, action-packed and has a brilliant soundtrack. Unfortunately it is a little hard to follow if you are not familiar with the series and characters, so I don&#039;t really recommend it as a stand-alone work.

    (Originally posted on my blog, moetology. Includes a teeny tiny bit of spoilers)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not exactly your typical Bungou Stray Dogs fan; I rather disliked season one due to the stories being short and weak, but season two dived into longer arcs, and the opening backstory nailed the emotional component and turned me into a fan. And if I had to pick a favorite character, it&#039;d be Kyouka first and Osamu second, instead of fan favorites like Chuuya.<br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs: Dead Apple is the latest installment in the franchise. It&#039;s a brand new story in the Bungou Stray Dogs universe, much like the Ordinal Scale movie in the Sword Art Online

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279924">
        world. But even though it&#039;s a brand new story, Dead Apple nevertheless is built on season two as it references characters introduced then, and one should definitely watch the TV seasons before watching Dead Apple.<br />
<br />
As far as the movie itself goes, Dead Apple offers plenty for the fans. The plot is tried and true; the Armed Detective Agency is called upon to solve another problem arising from a gifted user, much like how the stories in season one are structured. This time, the gang has to fight a villain who&#039;s able to pit gifted users against their own abilities. It plays right into the theme of characters accepting themselves for who they are, even if their abilities may have caused grief in the past.<br />
<br />
If you are like me and want to watch more of your favorite characters, don&#039;t worry; every Yokohama character gets screen time in Dead Apple, from the good guys, the Armed Detective Agency, to the frenemy, the Port Mafia folks, and even the government guy from season two. We also get teases of new characters who might show up in a sequel. Some characters, like Kyouka and the lead character Nakajima Atsushi, also receive a bit more backstory, and Atsushi in particular has a past with the villain.<br />
<br />
Dead Apple isn&#039;t without its flaws, however. The biggest issue is its lack of clarity around motivations, especially for the villain. The movie opens with a flashback story from six years ago as Dazai and Chuuya fights the villain for the first time, but exactly what this flashback had to do with the plot in Dead Apple beyond showing that Dazai knows about the villain isn&#039;t clear.<br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs: Dead Apple is a movie made for the series&#039; fans. It offers plenty of action, and the plot, while typical and safe, doesn&#039;t detract from the series. And it even manages to endear some characters to fans even more. The only question for fans now is: when is season three?

    Spoiler free review<br />
<br />
I think the most selling feature here is definitely the hype. It&#039;s a great movie to watch in a group and if you&#039;re a BSD fan, but not if you&#039;re looking for a top quality movie. Still, I think it accomplishes its job pretty well and it was still very enjoyable overall.<br />
<br />
I got to watch the premiere at anime boston 2018. Going in, I had watched season 1 and 2 of bsd. You definitely need to have watched both seasons before this movie.<br />
<br />
The story is probably one of the weakest parts of the movie but was still overall enjoyable. There are some things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276134">
        are rather confusing and could&#039;ve been explained better. There are some small plot holes that show that it wasn&#039;t the main focus here. It&#039;s rather predictable but it makes an effort not to be so as long as you don&#039;t consciously try analysing what comes next it isn&#039;t too much of a problem. 8/10<br />
<br />
The art is absolutely stunning! It&#039;s the same art you&#039;ve seen in the past (I don&#039;t remember s1 specifics but s2 has really great art and this movie&#039;s art is just as great) The colors are beautiful and there&#039;s many scenes with really nice and diverse color schemes. The animation for the fight scenes are full of hype and keep you at the edge of your seat. It really just enhances the overall watching experience. 10/10<br />
<br />
The opening and ending are great. Past BSD soundtrack comes up which increases the hype. Only thing is sometimes the background music is a little odd but I still think it&#039;s very fitting. 9/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really expect much character development in a movie based on an already well-developed series. That said, they still tried but it was nothing special. It was very explicit but I don&#039;t expect much more given the short time span. The characters are still the same as the ones from the past seasons though and I think that was conveyed very well. It was especially exciting seeing all them again after all this time. Character dynamics were also very well done and definitely a major part of the movie as well since their interactions fueled the plot and just made things more entertaining overall. 8/10<br />
<br />
Maybe I enjoyed it more than others because of the hype in the auditorium but I did very much enjoy it nonetheless. If you&#039;re a fan of BSD you will too. The only thing is some small confusions that I felt like could be explained better but it ultimately didn&#039;t take too much away from the experience. I may have also missed it because I watched it in such a public space. I would have to wait until I can stream it online to say anything more. 9/10<br />
<br />
Overall this is definitely worth watching!! It may not be a movie you&#039;ll remember 10 years for now but it brings back the hype that may have died down since the ending of season 2 and I believe it&#039;s executed very well. 9/10<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy!

    I am a huge Bungou Stray Dogs fan and i have to say this movie is a masterpiece!<br />
<br />
 Not because everything went well in the end or they finally give Chuuya more screentime, it is a masterpiece because the main subject is very well done even tho its just a side story0!<br />
<br />
 Story is not so far from the original series and art has definitly no problem, sounds, charaters and all were from the same actors in the both 1st and 2nd season so if you enjoyed those before, you sure will enjoy it now too.<br />
<br />
 My only problem with the whole story (even tho

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288432">
        its very well done) Dazai&#039;s death and coming back to life scene was a little absurd. Of course they connected everything with the anti-dote and Chuuya punching him but its still pretty much made sense when you consider the whole 1st and 2nd season.<br />
<br />
 All i can say about the movie is that i enjoyed it a lot and can&#039;t wait for the season 3!

    I&#039;m a fan of this Anime. Even though some thought this was pretty boring, mine was the opposite. <br />
<br />
Yeah, to be honest it did felt like it was a side story, but after watching this it wasn&#039;t actually pretty bad. I really just LOVED it! The animations are so smooth, I could clearly see the effort that was made into the movie and that&#039;s why I appreciate this movie so much. <br />
<br />
They should&#039;ve tried to make it a little longer too since there was something missing in the movie, like the fight in first parts of the movie that included the members of the detective

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341798">
        agency should&#039;ve been shown how they defeated their enemies too. They were given less spotlight to be honest and I really wanted to see them fight too, not just skip and later on it acted like nothing really happened at all, it was kind of a bit rushed? I was disappointed in that.<br />
<br />
The sounds aren&#039;t a much of a problem, it&#039;s good. <br />
<br />
But let me say, I finished watching S3 of Bungou Stray Dogs without watching this movie first. I still understand the story without watching this movie.<br />
<br />
But hey, I still recommend you watch this too, it&#039;s really cool. I enjoyed it too, the thing is, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ll feel the same way.  <br />
<br />

    just to give some context: i&#039;m not a massive bsd fan, i&#039;ve watched s1 but it didn&#039;t interest me enough to watch s2, and i only really watched this cause i was bored<br />
<br />
pros:<br />
- the art is very impressive, definitely feels like an improvement from s1 with both action and simpler scenes well illustrated: 100% the highlight of the show<br />
<br />
- the soundtrack, though not outstanding, works well with the scenes<br />
<br />
- generally, good voice actors (not much really to comment on)<br />
<br />
- the plot&#039;s based off an interesting premise, and i enjoyed watching how the different scenes were all linking together towards the ultimate finale<br />
<br />
- tatsuhiko shibusawa, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289802">
        antagonist, is a good character. yes, there are a lot of plotholes in his design/development, and he&#039;s a bit of your cliche &quot;everyone bores me&quot; villain, but i did feel that he worked nicely with the plot and the other characters.<br />
<br />
- overall, i really did enjoy dead apple. it made for a good watch on a sunday evening, filled with enough action to keep you on your toes as well as the ocassional interesting, if not a tad bit cliche, dialogue<br />
<br />
<br />
cons:<br />
- the pacing is a bit all over the place, and dead apple generally feels rushed. it hits you with climax after climax; i&#039;m not usually the type of person to seek comic relief in a serious-type film, but dead apple really needed a little more chill scenes towards the end. it felt like the animators were desperately not trying to pass 1h30.<br />
<br />
- adding to that rushed feeling, there are a lot of plotholes in dead apple. every once in a while, it felt like the writers were making a desperate attempt at linking a two scenes together without telling the viewer at all how this link can be made, and none of these plot holes are really resolved by the ending.<br />
<br />
- as much as i did like the villain, i really would have appreciated a bit more of a backstory. when it comes down to it, he is a very 2d character with OP villain tropes thrust at him in a poor(?) attempt to explain how he&#039;s linked to everyone. (spoiler alert: it doesn&#039;t work).<br />
<br />
overall:<br />
dead apple is a good movie, it has a decent plot line with high quality enough art to pull it off. if you overanalyse it, it&#039;s not exactly a top class film but, enjoyment wise, i feel all levels of bsd fans can enjoy it and, ultimately, that&#039;s the important thing.<br />

    Bungou Stray Dogs is back at it again, but this time it’s a movie called Dead Apple!<br />
<br />
Plot: 7<br />
<br />
The story’s about Shibusawa who’s known as the ‘collector’, has created incidents all over Japan, stealing ability users abilities with his fog. Shibusawa was spotted in Yokohama, so it’s up to the Armed Detective Agency who have taken the case in investigating the incidents around him. <br />
<br />
Let me start by saying the story wasn’t well executed. The story could have been explained better because I have no idea what Shibusawa and Demon Fudou’s goals were. It became more convulted and confusing in the second half. <br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
If you’ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288044">
        watched the first two seasons of Stray Dogs, you’ll see that the characters are still as diverse, well developed and likeable as always! The dynamics were well done and really fuelled the plot. I like that the characters were separated and split off into smaller groups because it avoided any bloating/useless characters on screen that I feel some movies suffer from. <br />
<br />
I’ll admit, Atsushi’s whining and self guilt with his past did annoy me in the first half, but his character development was amazing. Atsushi overcoming his past, not fearing the white tiger anymore and coming to terms with it was the acculumtion of his character arc so far, which was great to watch. <br />
<br />
Kyouka was badass as always. I liked her character development of realising that she doesn’t hate Demon Snow. It’s the symbolic representation of her mother who she loves and maternal love to protect their child. Best girl by a mile xD<br />
<br />
I like Dazai and Chuya’s relationship. It was great to see Chuya finally go all out and his ability is overpowered af!<br />
<br />
I loved the dynamic displayed between Atsushi, Akutagawa and Kyouka, especially the teamwork they displayed in the final fight!<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
The art was as amazing as it is in the anime, but with the movie’s beautiful animation it really shined. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and hype, especially when the opening music was playing.<br />
<br />
Sounds: 8<br />
The opening and ending are still some of my favourite. The osts really stood out and were memorable <br />
<br />
What I didn’t like about this movie:<br />
<br />
The villain were the weakest part of the film. Shibusawa came across as a twisted, psychotic evil villain that’s trying to be complex and philosophical. His Momoshiki like appearance and god complex were awful. His motivation were unclear and confusing.<br />
<br />
Why did Daizai team up with the other two? Even though Daizai was a double agent because he wanted to save the city, his reasoning was unclear. It felt like he needed to be removed from the story so other characters could shine. <br />
<br />
On the topic of other characters, I would have liked to see the other detective agency members fights. I felt like they were supposed to show them, but cut them out because of the movie’s time constraints.<br />
<br />
Why does everyone want Atsushi’s tiger ability? They claim it’s the “special gift that’s envied by other abilities users” and the villain claimed it’s the “anthesis of all special abilities”. Why? Atsushi gains physical strength, better movement and can heal. Unless I’m missing something about Atsushi’s power that has yet to be revealed, I don’t see the hype. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie felt like a 4 part- extended episode which was great. It came at the perfect time to remind me how much I love this anime, while I anticipate season 3!

    For an anime based on literary figures, it is more than you would expect. <br />
Speaking from the viewpoint of a person in love with literature, this movie which stems from the BSD franchise earns an overall (8/10), and here are the categories supporting it: <br />
<br />
-- Warning for minor spoilers --<br />
<br />
• Story (6/10) <br />
The concept of having our beloved characters fight against their own personified egos is over used, especially in shounen genre anime, making it chaff more than wheat. <br />
Although fast paced and action packed, the plot itself does not truly address the issue of Shibusawa&#039;s motivations, glossing it over with a rather generic mad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306157">
        scientist/bored rich guy explanation. It also becomes rather confusing at the end, without a sense of catharsis accompanying the resolution. Other than a brief glimpse into past happenings, bringing up once again The Dragon Head Conflict, the story is more action than emotion. <br />
While that may be expected of a shonen anime, personally I wish they included some aspects which could have related to literature more, or planned a proper story which relates to the main series. Hopefully, if BEAST is animated, we would see that unfold. <br />
<br />
• Art (8/10)<br />
Sketchy at times, but you could not blame them because of their supposed budgets, the art itself is gorgeous as ever. Not to the extent of KyoAni&#039;s or Makoto Shinkai&#039;s picturesque backgrounds, but most of the credit to art should go to character design. The characters are given details in facial expressions, clothing and gestures which mirror their personality very well. <br />
Of course, the still backgrounds are beautiful too, mostly with a noir feel to them, especially due to the nature of the story this time around. <br />
Fight scenes were well animated, fluid and dynamic, though it pales in comparison to more popular anime like BNHA or Naruto. <br />
<br />
• Sound (8/10)<br />
The soundtrack in this movie was an absolute joy. The producers ordered in a whole new slew of sounds, ranging from tranquil to blood-pumping. Each track played made the scenes come to life, injecting a sense of realism and urgency in an otherwise predictable plot. <br />
The soundtrack is definitely worth listening to even on its own, able to evoke emotions without a backstory. <br />
<br />
• Character (7/10)<br />
Other than the characters who appeared in the main series and those of which we have come to love, two new characters were introduced: the elusive Fyodor and the eccentric Shibusawa. <br />
Fyodor is the bigger player and has a more mysterious character compared to Shibusawa. Evidently, audiences are desperate to know more about his true intentions and plans after the teaser in season 2, and the movie only serves to elucidate a little on the latter. It sets up the stage needed for Fyodor in season 3, which he will finally begin to put his schemes into action. <br />
Shibusawa on the other hand, seems interesting at first but soon morphs into a generic character with a personal vendetta. With more screen time he had the potential to evolve better, but since his character is limited only to this movie, he becomes another forgettable character if not for the in-your-face advertising. <br />
<br />
• Enjoyment (7/10) <br />
If I were younger (hah) or had yet to be exposed to so, so many shonen anime, I could have enjoyed it better. There is induced lethargy in a predictable plot, but there is also unbridled joy at seeing your favourite characters bond over ass-kicking. <br />
It is up to you to decide whether you still have a love for the shone genre or not, but even if you don&#039;t, just watch this series for the creativity of employing literary figures and tons of dry literary in-jokes.

    I don&#039;t normally give out 9-star ratings, but this movie deserved it. It&#039;s mostly biased from the actual series from before, but that would make sense as this movie is a &quot;sequel&quot; to that in a sense. I loved this movie, the character development wasn&#039;t the best, but it was great; the main reason I gave out this score was the ending. Not only was it the same as the actual series of Bungo Stray Dogs, but it gave out a deeper meaning of the same theme/moral.<br />
<br />
This movie is themed around the fact that people will always help those in need, and that humans will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301340">
        always save what they believe is important to them, even if it means overcoming the past and looking over regrets. Without spoiling it too much, everyone is protecting Yokohama City, from the criminals, to the government, to the Armed Detectives Agency. All of them &quot;hate&quot; each other in a sense, and there&#039;s always something keeping them apart, especially how one is for evil, one is management, and one is for justice. In the end, they all team up and still protect what they cherish.<br />
<br />
Dazai might have been the star of this show, but we also see Atsuhi-kun overcoming his past, as he opens the door to the future and learns the truth to whom he is. He finally accepts who he is and becomes one with himself. Chuya and Dazai are enemies from not only their side and opinions, but from past events. This movie shows the trust between two friends no matter how far apart they may go apart (as you see when Chuya uses Corruption knowing only Dazai can stop him, even though they&#039;re enemies).<br />
<br />
This movie ended in a fast paced manner, but I enjoyed it, and enjoyed it a lot. The ending theme, the sense of satisfaction you get, and the realization that humans will always protect whom they love, the places they cherish, and will ditch all or any past behind them to do so, gave me a thriller. From a sound-perspective, the soundtrack was amazing and the placing of the original ending theme at the final battle was amazing in my opinion, the placement of the new ending theme was also perfect along with that final cutscene that shows the &quot;and so they lived on happily ever after&quot; type ending.<br />
<br />
I gave this movie a 9/10 because it is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece I&#039;ve seen in quite a while. If you read this, you should watch the main series, and also watch this movie right after. It gave me a new outlook on life and my opinions on the separate character&#039;s personalities.

    The movie was a lot of fun honestly. Felt like a long continuation of one whole episode. Which is always fun if you enjoy the anime, or just the series in general. If you love the series, you&#039;ll like this movie. I&#039;d say give it a shot honestly. Sure it&#039;s not the best movie in the world, or one of the best. But it&#039;s a fairly decent movie, and a good watching experience.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d give it a go if you&#039;ve got good enough time to kill. With it being an hour and 30mins of course. But it may be worth it.<br />
<br />
Art is always excellent. Story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315592">
        pretty good, gives a bit more in depth of some of the characters, which is always nice to see. A good solid movie.

    A short review (without spoilers), as I feel it is warranted to counter the people who rate this movie lowly. <br />
<br />
This movie has many, many layers. I&#039;m a fricking nerd and a philosopher, so I love it when a movie keeps my brain working - not to understand the plot, but what goes behind the plot. I think some people overlook many of the layers in this movie, and as a result aren&#039;t able to enjoy it to the fullest.<br />
So when you watch this movie, try to understand not just the plot, but the point of the plot. <br />
<br />
The layers and the characters are the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313435">
        strong points of this movie. <br />
<br />
My main issue with the movie is that there are some plot points that are not sufficiently explained.<br />
<br />
I gave an 8/10, but a 9/10 wouldn&#039;t have been a bad fit either. I enjoyed it very much.

    Story (10/10):<br />
<br />
For me, the story in Dead Apple was incredibly interesting to me. From the beginning I was hooked into the idea that people would be fighting their own Abilities, but it&#039;s so much more complicated than that. There were even some moments that pleasantly surprised me, though I won&#039;t say anything about that here since I know the movie hasn&#039;t been released online yet (to my knowledge) and hasn&#039;t screened in every location. I think the story was very well written and entertaining.<br />
<br />
Art (8/10):<br />
<br />
As always, Bungou Stray Dogs has appealing art for me, but not enough to give it anything higher than a 8.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280380">
        Still, the art was very pretty to look at and there were plenty of scenes that were animated well and looked rather beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10):<br />
<br />
For me, the &quot;op&quot; of the movie was a very good song, as was most of the soundtrack. That said, there were a few songs that didn&#039;t catch me all too much, so that&#039;s why I&#039;m not giving the sound a higher rating. There&#039;s not necessary anything wrong with the music, it just personally isn&#039;t adding anything to me.<br />
<br />
Character (10/10):<br />
<br />
As per usual, I adore nearly all of the characters in Bungou Stray Dogs, and Dead Apple was no exception. I think the bit they included with Atsushi (to keep this as vague as possible) was definitely something interesting I hadn&#039;t expected to touch on. The connection that was right under our noses the entire time was obvious, but the actual EVENT was far from what I expected. All the characters made me feel good and I was (and I may be a little biased saying this) extremely pleased to see more of Chuuya even if he was still not in it as much as Atsushi, Akutagawa, etc. It was more than I was used to, and I definitely think he got deserved screen time.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
<br />
It&#039;s obvious by now, but I enjoyed the movie greatly. I assumed I would like it from the moment I heard there would be a movie, but it exceeded my expectations even then. I was completely sucked in the entire time and there wasn&#039;t a moment that I felt bored. In fact, I was a bit sad once it ended because I realized the joy I was feeling from it wouldn&#039;t continue since there wasn&#039;t much more. It was really something I enjoyed from start to finish and I would&#039;ve seen it multiple times if I wasn&#039;t busy<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10):<br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs Dead Apple was a masterpiece and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m over exaggerating when I say that. I&#039;m surprised that the rating on here is as low as it is, especially considering the feedback I heard from others. The movie was incredible in every shape and form. I will definitely be buying this movie the moment I get a chance.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, it was necessary to mention a certain plot points and characters&#039; story lines, since I wanted my criticism to be argumentative. I was waiting for this movie eagerly, especially because I was very intrigued by the new characters of Shibusawa and Fyodor. Bones studio was promoting this movie with a specific emphasis on these two and guess what? Eventually they got almost no screen time and their personalities and motives remained as vague as possible. That’s just a fraud from the movie makers, to bait viewers with posters of a new interesting characters and then reduce their roles almost to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291435">
        background. And who got all the limelight? Of course it was freaking Atsushi. The movie left me very disappointed and the main reason is this disgusting main character. It’s quite usual for shounen genre MCs to be the most irritating and worst characters among the whole cast. They are usually dumb, shallow and primitive, but always win against all odds with a power of plot shield. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the case for Bungou too. It’s especially sad because there are a lot of much more classy characters in Bungou, and there is a certain character who fits the role of MC a hundred times better than Atsushi - it’s Dazai of course. But instead the author chose to make a loud, dull and hysterical teenager his main hero. Yet the majority of fanbase still like Dazai more, he leads by a wide margin in all fan surveys. Perhaps the problem is with the manga publishers who force authors to create the same stereotypical MCs, since they think that’s what their main audience of teenagers want. But Bungou has more mature, detective feel to its story, so it’s just stupid to force it into the shounen territory with a typical and annoying shounen MC. He just looks out of place here and ruins the whole story.<br />
<br />
Almost all problems of this movie are caused by Atsushi and the absurdly large amount of screen time he got while other storylines and characters remained underdeveloped. Atsushi is a very irritating character by himself, but his storyline is also nothing really special. It just doesn’t worth the time wasted on it. Why should we watch how he ‘struggles’ against his freaking tiger (everyone can guess he would win in the end) while Dazai remains in the main antagonist’s castle? Wouldn’t it be much more interesting to follow Dazai’s  storyline more thoroughly? Also Kyouka takes too much time absolutely undeservedly too. She just doesn’t bring anything to the main story. Why is she and her sobby cliche ‘drama’ is even in this movie? She just fills the role of the obligatory boring MC’s girlfriend, but her problems literally have nothing to do with this movie’s plot. Why bring her here? In the battles she didn’t really help, she was like a like a third wheel.<br />
<br />
Because of a very small amount of screen time the motives for the two new characters remained more than unclear and vague. I wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t even thought out properly in the first place. What exactly Shibusawa wanted to achieve with all that abilities collection? It’s also very annoying and stupid how the author tried to tie his story to Atsushi. Apparently he was able to kill Shibusawa in the past and conveniently forgot about it, so they could just pull this amnesia nonsense out of nowhere. He also did it while his ability wasn’t even fully awakened, what an obnoxious mary sue. Shibusawa wanted his power… for some reason. Because he is the MC, right? That’s apparently enough explanation, he is special simply because he is. That actually always amazed me in Bungou - what the hell is so special in Atsushi’s dull ability, since it comes down to the most primitive brute force? Atsushi no doubt has the most boring and uninteresting skill while other characters have much more intriguing powers. So, speaking of Shibusawa, if the author implies that he did everything simply out of boredom - that’s the most lazy and stereotypical explanation possible for the cause of antagonist’s actions. Fyodor’s motive also remained undiscovered, most likely for the author too. Did he try to make an apocalypse by using Shibusawa and his collection? Looks like complete nonsense and again a very primitive banality. But that’s not the characters’ fault, the screenwriter is to blame that he couldn’t come up with a reasonable motivation for such promising and beautifully designed characters.<br />
<br />
Shibusawa and Fyodor themselves are wonderful characters, it’s truly sad that because of a little screen time amount they weren’t fully developed. Even a famous voice actors were invited for them. And after the great work of the character designer and VAs, the screenwriter just wasted such remarkable roles. These two deserved much better, the movie creators don’t respect even their own characters who they put on every poster to promoted this movie. Since their motives seem like a simple bad writing, I’ll be considering that Fyodor’s goal was to bring back Shibusawa’s memory. At least then his actions start to make sense. It’s also incredibly annoying and idiotic that author apparently followed the worst shounen cliches and couldn’t allow the MC’s enemies to unite - because if they made a true alliance they would have won against him. If there was a bit of common sense in this plot, there would be no reason for Fyodor to attack Shibusawa, since he could have brought his memory back simply by pressing a crystal on his forehead. He did that in the movie too and that was the cause for the memory return, there was no need for the strike. It was added for useless pathos and to bring discord between them while they should have stayed on the same side and united to bring down the MC since that was what they wanted. Besides, if Shibusawa already revived once even in this ‘ghostly’ form, what was stopping him from doing the same again? Actually nothing. That means the final battle was also pointless and he could have survived. Also it’s especially jarring that before no enemies of the MC and his agency died in anime. Even everyone from the Guild lived though they were practically at war with the agency. And suddenly the screenwriter decided to get rid of the new character, it’s simply not fair since literally every other enemy got to live.<br />
<br />
There is also another question concerning plot credibility - why did Shibusawa and Fyodor even allowed Dazai to join them? They know he wasn’t really on their side and acted as a double agent. Was it just for fun, because Shibusawa was bored? Then it’s a very convenient and incredibly forced plot handout for the MC and his team. It’s a distinctive feature of the bad written script, to make characters act intentionally stupid so the MC could win due to their illogical actions. If they acted more rationally, they would be victorious.<br />
<br />
The ending was turned into trainwreck. Such an interesting and enigmatic character as Shibusawa was transformed into some kind of a monster, apparently so MC could have won over some ‘scary’ opponent. And it seems he won simply with his retarded screaming, I’m not even joking he screamed like a psycho till the very end of the battle. I got so freaking tired of his instant screaming and loud hysterical reaction to everything during the movie, it made me sick. And of course the author forced Akutagawa to help the MC once again, despite him being Atsushi’s enemy and hating him. It’s so irritating how they make Akutagawa MC’s unwitting ally every time, apparently the author just can’t let somebody truly hate his mary sue MC.<br />
<br />
The main plot itself is also worth noticing for its secondary writing, if not to say a plain plagiarism. I think everyone who watched Bleach could easily recognise a Zanpakutou filler arc in this storyline about the abilities gaining their own will and separating from their owners. Akutagawa’s ability even has a very similar design to one of the Zanpakutou, Kazeshini. How is it even possible in the Bungou world to separate the powers from their owners? Nothing like this was ever implied before in the story, these powers are inborn part of a person, it’s not some individual spirits like in case with Zanpakutou. It makes no sense to separate them, where did they get an independent will from? It’s looks like a rip-off from that Bleach arc or at least borrowing of its ideas. Also the screenwriter apparently doesn’t care for the plot consistency even in details - it was said in the beginning of the movie that you can regain your ability only of you defeat it yourself. But in the end Fukuzawa and Mori joined forces and defeated each other’s abilities, and for some reason it worked for them.<br />
<br />
All in all the screen time was mostly wasted for Atsushi’s temper tantrums and the primitive shounen cliches. It’s truly upsetting, because as I said before there are so much more worthy characters in Bungou, as well as two new classy  antagonists. I think those two got about five minutes of the total screen time, not counting the ending with transformed Shibusawa. How is it even acceptable? Were there really so many people interested in watching the bland and boring Atsushi with his banal shounen shenanigans? I think not many, and if Dazai was the protagonist, the movie would have been much better even with all those other flaws. Though I guess the movie creators tried to make a distraction from all these plot holes and stupidity with an explicit fanservice, especially with Chuuya. But it can’t hide all problems of this movie.

    This was frankly just baffling, and unless you&#039;re into fanservice and don&#039;t really care about characters and a coherent plot, just skip this one even if you like the series.<br />
<br />
For context, I&#039;ve been enjoying the anime and the manga in the last few months or so, and I was looking forward to watch this. The art/animation in the anime is just beautiful and in this sense the film did not disappoint. The action scenes were all great as well.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the tone was somewhat off compared to the previous 2 seasons and the manga. It&#039;s in fact an anime original (not based on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292338">
        the manga or a LN) and it shows, because it&#039;s a lot of fan pandering, mostly to the fujo, I guess. The manga barely has any of that, the anime did but in a sort of lighthearted Gintama way so it never felt bothersome before. Yaoi pandering to me is like ecchi; if I can avoid it I gladly do, as I find it generally lowers the tone.<br />
<br />
The characterisation of many of the characters was also weird, as in characters regressing out of nowhere and making decisions that felt ooc, especially MC. The plot didn&#039;t make much sense, I kept thinking I missed bits and that&#039;s why I didn&#039;t get it, but turns out they were just plot-holes.<br />
<br />
I hope this isn&#039;t a reflection of what a season 3 will look like, although given that they&#039;ll (I guess, right?) adapt from the manga again that shouldn&#039;t really be the case.

    Bungo Stray Dogs Dead Apple Movie Review<br />
By: Asaguri Kafuka<br />
April 30 2019<br />
<br />
Unexpectedly, the antagonist at the end of the season 2 has been welcomed and introduced on this movie. This one is a continuation of the series and I&#039;m really glad that the animation does not change like what Kuroko no Basket did. It stays the same. Cool, great, amazing. This movie mainly focuses on Atsushi and his past. How he can overcome that darkness and accept it to be much stronger person. Though he is the highlight of the movie, I think it was already decided which is the most powerful gifted person, and the

        best partnership this anime have. Chuuya and Dazai, the most powerful badass and the most smartest suicidal maniac. Their combination is perfect and flawless.

    As a huge fan of Bungo Stray Dogs I had both high expectations and nervousness about this film-- my main concern was that it wasn&#039;t going to be as good as the show. I was wrong-- I really enjoyed this film and thought it was very fun! Although I did have some issues with pacing and scenes ending suddenly, I still really enjoyed it!<br />
<br />
The characters were brilliant as always although I wish we could see more of the other characters. The music and animation was dope and the story was enjoyable, although I can see why some fans were upset over this film and that&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345028">
        one of the reasons why I was cautious (because I saw people saying that it wasn&#039;t good)-- but even so, I think a lot of fans (like myself) enjoyed it! <br />
<br />
My main issue was the pacing- the film&#039;s pacing was too quick and they didn&#039;t leave a whole lot of time to explain much which left me and other viewers confused. I believe this film would&#039;ve been better as a full season or even half a season so they could take time to really polish it and make it more clear. <br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re a fan of BSD, give this film a go, it didn&#039;t disappoint me and I hope it doesn&#039;t disappoint you!

    i made this based on my personal opinion, sorry if it doesn&#039;t match your taste. also you better not read this if you haven&#039;t watch the movie because im afraid i might spill some spoiler.<br />
<br />
for me they better make a season 3 rather than this movie, seriously its a waste. there are a lot of scenes going on in the movie that are unnecessary, especially that incident with atsushi&#039;s past. we already know that atsushi has managed to deal with his anxiety in the previous series but then somehow they come up with more anxiety again that we already so done with. also the villain&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298613">
        motive to make yokohama into chaos and put all people in danger is too weak. like, doesn&#039;t he has a better excuse to destroy a town? he looks just so lame at the end. and of course the way atsushi blindly believe in dazai but others don&#039;t is so unclear for me, they should make a better explanation. there are also some gaps among several events that need to be cleared.<br />
<br />
but despite the main protagonist and antagonist i actually enjoy the other characters more in this movie like chuuya, dazai, akutagawa, fyodor, and somehow kyoka. they managed to blur the vagueness between atsushi and shibusawa to bring the excitement and make me enjoy this movie at the end.

    This was the last BSD animation I watched. I&#039;ve already watched all three seasons and Kunikida&#039;s special &quot;Hitori Ayumu&quot; before watching this, and from what I heard prior to watching Dead Apple from my friends, the movie was supposedly good. I had fallen in love with Bungou Stray Dogs (the plot is just very... chef&#039;s kiss, for a lack of a better expression) and, ultimately, Dazai, as most of the fans probably had. There is just something so attractive about manipulative geniuses that make viewers question their own feelings towards the character. Kidding. Well, half. Although I do think characters like Dazai are what pull

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331811">
        me into a series (see: Lelouch from Code Geass, Guren from Owari no Seraph).<br />
<br />
I had given Dazai the crown. He became my favorite character. So you would imagine how slightly disappointed I was when he didn&#039;t really appear in Dead Apple.<br />
<br />
Dazai&#039;s character is very, how should I say, dark? He&#039;s extremely smart at predicting the future and preparing for the chaos that would ensue with every single step he takes. He has proven countless times in the last three seasons how stupidly intelligent he is, and Dead Apple was not an exception. Putting an antidote in his mouth right before he got &#039;ambushed&#039;? Brilliant. He knew how it would all turn out. It was like he was controlling the whole chess game. However, they didn&#039;t really show him much and instead focused more on the others&#039; dilemmas and battles with their own special abilities. Although that was important to showcase (especially considering the ability the enemy had), I think it would&#039;ve been better if there were some kind of depth(?) to whatever Dazai&#039;s plan was. I don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
The lack of screen time for Dazai in Dead Apple was a bit of a disappointment, considering how great of an outfit he was given, as well as the fact that he was basically the &#039;mastermind&#039; or whatever. Dazai was just sort of... there? For the most part, kind of. Maybe I&#039;m just being biased, haha. Just felt like maybe there could&#039;ve been more tension or something. Not gonna lie, Atsushi&#039;s dilemma felt a bit prolonged, but I did grow to like Akutagawa and Chuuya more through Dead Apple. And, of course, fell even more in love with Dazai. The animation was great.

    Dead Apple is surprisingly cool and actually quite a good movie!<br />
When you know whats happening.<br />
As a HUGE BSD fan I mean this in the best way possible, but: This movie is extremely damn confusing to anyone who DOESN&#039;T know anything about Dead Apple, and that isn&#039;t Asagiri&#039;s fault, but BONES for not being able to condense it properly in a way that makes sense. I watched this movie 3 times and didn&#039;t get it, its just stuff happening and Dazai and Chuuya having, moments. The animation is good as always, very clean and pretty, I LOVE the way some of the scenes looked, but just
