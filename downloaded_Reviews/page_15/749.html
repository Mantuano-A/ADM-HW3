    Every Magi fan&#039;s favorite OP character Sinbad gets his own series. Being a big fan of Magi myself I was very excited about this.<br />
<br />
Fair warning, if you haven&#039;t watched Magi, you really won&#039;t get the same satisfaction from watching this. I suggest watching the Magi series first before watching this.<br />
<br />
It begins with Sinbad&#039;s birth. Showing the background story of how Sinbad ends up becoming the swashbuckling man he is in the Magi series. These episodes drew me in right away. If you&#039;re a fan of the Magi series you will really enjoy this part. I loved being able to see a baby Sinbad interact with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223214">
        his family and grow into this heroic, lovable teenager. You get to see him conquer his first dungeon and decide that he wants to create his own country and change the world. It leaves you feeling satisfied. <br />
<br />
However after the first few episodes it becomes less about Sinbad&#039;s character and more about the characters that will end up joining him on his journey.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong I love the nostalgic feeling of seeing the characters from the Magi series pop up in this series. However, it cuts the character development of Sinbad short. It becomes more focused on the character development of his comrades and how each of them has come to make their decision to join him in his efforts to change the world. The most touching story was Ja&#039;far&#039;s. His story and character development really provides those with prior knowledge about his character in the Magi series some interesting insight to when and how his unwavering loyalty began to blossom.<br />
<br />
As for the development of Sinbad&#039;s character, it continues to stay the same after the beginning episodes for the most part. I understand maybe the creators wanted to keep the image of Sinbad as this all powerful character untarnished, but we didn&#039;t even get to see how he discovers the true power of his Djinn. <br />
<br />
All we see after the first few episodes is how great Sinbad is and how wonderful he is at everything. I&#039;m ready for his world to be shaken a little. To see him transform into the complex character that he is in the Magi series. Riding the waves between good and evil. Taking the path less travelled on. <br />
<br />
Only in the very last episode do we see a small glimpse at an obsessive but mostly motivated look on the face of Sinbad as he contemplates his future. His curiosity about Magis grows intensely in this episode, and you can see in his face he is hungry for more knowledge. It foreshadows a possible adventure where he goes in search of a magi. This leaves a pretty good set up for the next season, which I expect to be a much more exciting season for Sinbad. I foresee some actual character changes and I&#039;ll remain hopeful for that.<br />
<br />
Even if the focus wasn&#039;t really on Sinbad so much as the people joining him on his journey I still enjoyed watching this. Seeing more of the unique world that Magi is set in, and getting to see the origin stories of Sinbad&#039;s party has been really great. It&#039;s an upbeat adventure and at times you&#039;ll find yourself smiling at the silly comedy. All that it is lacking is a bit of depth.<br />
<br />

    And so ends, one of the most greatest anime of the season. This was  rather impressive and the anime does a rather good job at adapting the manga about probably the greatest character in Magi, who is known as Sinbad to a certain degree. In this review, I will try to leave it spoiler free.<br />
<br />
Story-9<br />
The story is brilliant. Depicting the life of probably the strongest living character in Magi. This is a prequel series that shows us the life of Sinbad and his journey to change the world. Such as the struggles that he experiences and the people that he meets to get stronger.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226605">
        The pacing seems rather okay at times, sometimes it does feel a bit rushed, but apart from that I find it easy to get into the mood. I have found the story filled with adventure and comedic aspects that have honestly grabbed me, and have cracked me up.<br />
<br />
Art-8<br />
I enjoyed the art. Not much I can say about it. The characters are drawn rather well. Animation is great.<br />
<br />
Sound-8<br />
Having that amazing soundtrack present is what makes me engaged in Sinbad&#039;s story. Those opening and ending songs really grab you and make you want to join up with Sinbad as well.<br />
<br />
Voice Actors-10<br />
They have managed to grab the same voice actors from the OVA and from the anime adaption, so I would deem this impressive. The characters in this anime feel like they are being voiced according to how they behave. They have such fitting voice actors for their respective characters.<br />
<br />
Character-9<br />
Lets just say that if you want to know more about the characters that Sinbad has worked with then go with the manga as well. You have Sinbad, Yunan, Ja&#039;far, Dragul, Serendine, Badr (Sinbad&#039;s father), Esra (Sinbad&#039;s Mother), Barbarossa, Mystras, Spartos, Baal, Hinahoho, Pisti, Piprika, Zamil, Tabi etc. All these characters will be expanded on or introduced, the anime has gone through a few and helped set up the cast that Sinbad will be travelling with. Some of that cast has already been shown in the Magi Season 1 and 2 anime adaptions as well. So it would feel rather nostalgic.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10<br />
I am a major Magi fan. More Magi is never a bad thing. After waiting 2 or so years after the OVA(longer after Season 2), then you can realize how much of an amazing feel this is. This contains probably one of the most interesting characters throughout Magi. Finding out about his adventures and how he became the man that he is now is worth the adventure of watching this series. So, even though I didn&#039;t get a certain Fanalis or Magician I can say that I enjoyed the cast that we had and I found them rather hilarious.<br />
<br />
Overall-9<br />
I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. It does seem a bit funny at times, but just wait it will get so much better. Has always the manga is a preferred option, but this adaption is pretty good. The history of Sinbad, Sinbad&#039;s friends, family and so on. If you are here to witness who he was as a child, why he became who he is right now and what caused him to become great, then this is the anime for you. <br />
<br />
Let us all hope for that Season 2 everyone!

    Story:10/10<br />
I loved Sinbad since the Magi series and he easily became one of my favorite characters.It felt so good to be able to witness his journey to become king and to create Syndria.I loved the pacing and all his adventures that came,how he matured and captured all the dungeons.It was a series full of surprises as well because of the turns it took such as his quickly mastering the djinn equip and his courage to face everyone with an open mind.The story I enjoyed the most was his adventure in the Imuchakk kingdom as part of Valefor arc.Also to see elements such as amazons and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224239">
        legendary warriors assimilated into the lore of the series was great.I hope that we will get a season 2 because what is to come is even better.<br />
Art:10/10<br />
I loved Magi&#039;s series art and to see it back it was a complete delight given the fact it was by the same author.<br />
Sound:9.5/10<br />
There were very few occasions when I felt that the sound was out of the place but usually the songs chosen made the situation justice.<br />
Character:10/10<br />
Sinbad is a young man born into a war-torn world that needed desperately a hero and with his ambition,intelligence and ability to make the others follow him he ended up being a great leader as well as being really handsome.Hinahoho was transformed through Sinbad into a fierce warrior able to have a family and responsible enough to be a father.Jafar was a soul full of darkness and the moment when Sinbad hugged his dark and his pure self-was heartwarming because he gave him a purpose to live for.Hinahoho&#039;s father,the king of Imuchakk,the knight king of Sasan and the queen of Artemyre were all characters who despite the problems each had in their country and the traits each one exposed:fierce warrior,religious zealot and a lonely queen who rules by the law of iron were brought to a point where they needed to expose their qualities in order to face and join Sinbad&#039;s company.The Djin we saw are various and each I think was given time to shine individually and my favorite was Valefor.<br />
Enjoyment:10/10<br />
I sincerely enjoyed this series far more than Magi,each episode made me hunger for more and each time I wanted it to deliver it did,sometimes more than expected.<br />
Overall:10/10<br />
I loved the ending because I interpret it as a preview of a possible season 2 that can&#039;t come faster.

    I have mixed feelings about the existence of the Anime.<br />
<br />
So, as a fan of the Magie series, I am waiting for a third season of Magi... and when I ended the second season and the OVA of Sinbad with 5 episodes came out, I was like: Okay, it&#039;s cool, I want to know more about Sinbad and his comerades...<br />
But the 5 episodes did not statisfied me a bit.<br />
<br />
So now we have this! Why does it exist? The 5 episodes I have watched (OVA) are in this new Anime plus some other episodes (which are perfect, no doubt). <br />
But why did they not countinued the OVA

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226692">
        under the titel of the OVA? Why did they not took out the 5 episodes, which we saw before, and made new content?<br />
<br />
What I also must say, before my real review, I am afraid of the relase date of the third season of Magi, because the Sinbad series just had an open ending, which means that the fans want a Continuation ( I want it too! ). But what will happen to Magi?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
I am the type of a person which loves historical events, like wars and political issues. In Magi or here in Sinbad also we have countries, wars, alliances and trades. I feel like I have found an Anime which shows me my whole interests in a bundle.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The Art is nothing new. Every other Anime is like that colorful and it remindes me of the Kyoto Animation Animes. So here I am a bit disappointed because it is nothing special.<br />
What I disliked was the jumping between scenes. It was like they forget to show us a scene, when it comes to battle scenes. <br />
<br />
The animation was good though.<br />
Just kid Sinbad was really big for a child, it didn&#039;t fit in the scenery.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I did not enjoy the opening, not the ending, there is no soundtrack which I can call for. <br />
Nothing special here.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
There was a bit too much kitsch in here. Sinbad which babbled too much about friendship. For example the Ja&#039;far scene, where he cried a bit and Sinbad cames and rescued him. It could have been better. But it is okay. I am not complaining much.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Also Magi has many critical points, points which I did not like, but anyways I enjoyed it much, like this Anime. There was just one episode which was totaly needless (Artemyra Arc, when Sinbad got banned and was naked the whole episode).<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Art: 5<br />
Sound: 4<br />
Character: 5<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
All in all: 5<br />
<br />

    Magi: Adventure of Sinbad has a lot less of the flavor that made the original Magi entertaining. That flavor mainly being the themes that were brought up about kingship, genocide and the morality of war and peace alongside a very interesting medieval and arab setting that was well explored. But most of that was left absent from this spin off or not touched upon to the degree in which the original series went to, which made it feel very underwhelming and more shounen-like and superficial. Now lets get on with it, and let me remind you that I watched the original two seasons of magi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229051">
        two years ago so my memory isn&#039;t the best.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story begins with a boy being born, Sinbad of course, and when his conception took place the world&#039;s sky went crazy in a burst of magical energies because of how great he was and many characters from the original series looked on in awe and wondered &quot;wow a great power has entered the world&quot;. This is where i immediately saw red flags for what the shows&#039; story was going to become. The fact that the rukh (the magical energies of this world) reacted so heavily to his birth was because he was fated to be a great king. Which basically meant that because of luck or random chance he was fated to be great no matter what. It took away any chance he had of failing and removed a lot of his agency from his actions. Which means he is essentially doing everything he is doing because of destiny. Which makes the story seem less like an adventure and more like a checklist of things he has to do before he can become a king. While this could work from an existentialist perspective this show is very far removed from those ideas.<br />
<br />
So back on track. Sinbad is born and many years later in his boyhood experiences the horrors of war which end up forcing his newfound friend and farther to lead each other to their deaths. This motivates him on a journey to create his own kingdom and bring peace to the world. So he is enlisted into a force to capture a dungeon (basically like a dungeon in an mmo and if you complete it you get the power of a god). In his exploits here he makes an interesting idealistic contrast of his want to bring peace to the world to that of the more selfish and fearfilled actions of the state. While it was somewhat interesting at first to see some kid give a finger to the man it got old after like, I dont know the second time he did it. And he does it a whole hell of a lot in this show. Basically the entire show is just comprised of him going to point A and B and pressing his very idealistic and unrealistic views on people and being so fucking OP because he is blessed by god that they just believe him after he shows his power. So things quickly get stale. It gets to a point where Sinbad and his crew are captured and stripped and then thrown into a giant pit which is also filled with deadly snakes, and as if acknowledging their own inability to fail then proceed to make gags about it for 10 minutes like the audience isn&#039;t even supposed to care. While it would be interesting to see the turn the story would take if he failed and he had to question how ridiculous his ideals for world piece are, it never happened, and a sequel may also never happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
This is definitely the shows greatest asset. The characters designs are vibrant, varied and interesting. The settings are also visually interesting with some great and consistent background art. The fights and general visual presentation is way above the standards set by the standard Toei or Pierrot shounen.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound just faded into the background for the most part for me and I never really got attracted to any of the pieces. I&#039;m not sure if they were the same tracks used in Magi but I just wasnt feeling it. It wasnt bad enough to make a note of it but it also wasn&#039;t good. Then again that might also be influenced by the short run time and also my disinterest in the story. For several scenes they tried using electro music to make a moment more hype but was very off putting and clashed with the setting. It was also often overly bombastic like at the ends of character arcs where its expecting you to have a connection to a basic character you have only known for an episode or two.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Sinbad is boring. He is just goes through his same shtick of helping people and beating people who disagree with him over and over and never changes throughout the course of the series. Of course ignoring the first episode. He never really gets upset, doubts himself, doubts his friends, doubts his beliefs for long enough to make him feel human and in turn makes him very unrelatable. But what that does do is it makes him a good symbol for what a king is. Which is why the supporting cast follows him. An emotionally strong leader dead set in his ideals who backs down to know one and takes on the impossible. Which seeing how this show turns out makes me realize how he  was much better suited for his supporting role in the main series as a contrast to Alibaba. But he could still be an interesting character as long as the messages that he gives causes the supporting cast to change.<br />
While this does happen the pay off is not there as most of the supporting cast is only given a few episodes at most to meet Sinbad, go &quot;wow he is so kakui&quot; and have a renewed belief in themselves. After that they are basically background decoration and don&#039;t do much for the story besides comic relief or running errands. Not to mention they are mostly one note and only act seriously when its required which can make it hard to get engaged with them especially with the little screen time they get. Especially characters like Ja&#039;far who makes a complete 180 from a blood thirsty assassin into a cutie pie shota because magic and love. If only it was so easy.<br />
But there is still a glimmer of hope in the character Drakon, who was the leader of the troops sent into the dungeon with Sinbad. He was given his position because of his noble birth and ended up being a bit of a selfish snob because of it. So when he loses to sinbad and hears his ideals he rethinks and questions himself on why he cant win when he is trying his best and doing it for his country and his men and so he can come back alive to see the girl he loves. Only to discover that when he gets out of the dungeon he is shamed by his people for not being able to take the god of the dungeon for himself and he also discovers that the girl he loves has just entered a political marriage with his brother that doesnt care for her. This makes him a very interesting character in relation to Sinbad because he is going through a similar unfairness brought upon by war that Sinbad went through in his boyhood except he is in a position of power and therefore appreciates the benefits of a militaristic society and would be more apt to weigh the pros and cons. His character also changed a lot more slowly compared to the rest of the cast which felt more believable. But sadly the series ended and it went nowhere.<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
Magi: Adventure of Sinbad is a good time passer just to see the magi aesthetic again but it never managed to become anything more than that. Even though the beginning had some interesting prospects they weren&#039;t realized because the show did not end.

    Opinion?<br />
<br />
I love, love, LOVE, this anime to death. Sinbad is one of my all-time favorite characters. I personally ship him massively with ja&#039;far as well and this story really en-captured Ja&#039;far and Sinbad&#039;s roots together. I watched this before watching Magi so my opinion is more extreme than other fans, but my enjoyment of this piece still stands. I wish a new season continuing off this would air soon, I have a feeling my review might be similar if they keep up the amazing art and characters. Plus the fight scenes were to die for.  <br />
<br />
Flaws?<br />
<br />
I am biased towards this show so pardon me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328895">
        but the only flaw I see is that lack of. Whilst generic it can be in some regard I love it all the same.<br />
<br />
10/10 This show is beautiful and deserves more praise.

    It’s so bad it’s hard to watch. This sentence perfectly sums up this anime. Unfortunately, Sinbad no Bouken was a huge mistake and I’ll explain why.<br />
<br />
I’ve been reading Magi’s manga and I’ve watched a few episodes of the anime. I was so interested in this one because who doesn’t love Sinbad? He’s one of the more intriguing characters of this franchise. I remember that, surrounded by all the hype, I even made a FB fanpage about him when it aired.<br />
<br />
But Sinbad from Sinbad no Bouken is just so bad, he’s personality is flat, there’s nothing interesting about him. He overcomes every struggle without a problem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367767">
        which makes him look fake, it’s just too easy. All of the other characters that appear later in the story are undeveloped. I don’t even want to begin with Ja’far, he’s character arc is almost nonexistent.<br />
<br />
The story itself is too simple, there’s nothing that would invest me emotionally in it. I’m aware of the fact that they couldn’t change his past because we already know him from Labyrinth but they could’ve tried to make it more believable.<br />
<br />
Animation is also a big let down. It looks rushed and there’s nothing nice that I could say about it.<br />
<br />
I don’t even remember anything about the music so I guess it says enough about that.<br />
<br />
All in all, it’s just a bad anime. There’s so many more that are worth your time, don’t waste it on this one.

    What can I say this anime was a perfect balance of Action/Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy , all four of these genres are shown so well and I enjoyed it so much more than the the other magi series.<br />
<br />
The main character Sinbad has such a positive personality that it makes me want to be more positive in real life. The action was well done for a fantasy anime, the adventure of the dungeons and different countries and the comedy of the crew that actually made me laugh out loud!<br />
<br />
This anime definitely sets the ground works for more seasons which it truly deserves!!! There is so much more to explore

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292879">
        and to be honest I binged this whole anime in one day so I am sad there is no more :( but I really hope there will be another season, this anime is really under rated because it is a spin off series but to be honest you could watch this without having seen the other magi series. I feel like this should&#039;ve been a 24 episode anime so they could explore the characters more cause I really wanted to see more adventures!! <br />
<br />
Lets all hope we get another season!!!!!

    I really wanted to like this show more. As is the case with many people, I found Sinbad to be the most compelling character in the first two seasons of Magi. After watching this prequel, however, I&#039;m wondering if the mystery and mystique surrounding Sinbad in the original Magi series is part of what makes him so compelling. Telling his backstory didn&#039;t seem to work as well as it should have. But it was still a fun show to watch.<br />
<br />
STORY - 6/10:<br />
<br />
I felt like this was really where the show fell a little flat. What could have been an interesting story, outlining a long, hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243577">
        journey for Sinbad to become a king and form the Seven Seas Alliance turns out to be fairly rote and straightforward. After a couple interesting episodes involving his birth and parents and eventually capturing the first dungeon, the show basically devolves into small 2-3 episode arcs where he travels to some new country, gains an alliance with them really easily, and picks up a new crew member. It&#039;s almost like a grocery list - we know he has his little group of generals later on, so we&#039;re just going down the list, ticking them off one by one as he travels around. <br />
<br />
There doesn&#039;t seem to be any real challenge. Most of these people are eager to leave with him, despite barely knowing him (I guess Jafar is a bit of an exception, at first). All the places he goes are supposed to be super xenophobic and hate outsiders, but a teenager is able to change their minds with little effort. He pretty much just has to show off his super powers and they all fawn over him and gush to join his peaceful alliance. Even something as simple as his djinn equip - in the original Magi, Alibaba&#039;s experience learning to use his djinn equip was emotional and difficult and helped shape him. He had to overcome something in order to gain that power. With Sinbad, he just figured it out offscreen and suddenly shows it off at the opportune moment. It&#039;s all too easy.<br />
<br />
I was really expecting Sinbad to have to overcome more difficulties in order to succeed. Everything just seems to come so easily. Hell, even when he&#039;s not sure what to do, a Magi shows up and just tells him!<br />
<br />
ART - 8/10:<br />
<br />
The artwork is solid, and the animation is good. I don&#039;t know a whole lot about anime studios in Japan, but apparently this is done by a pretty new studio. They only have like 7 anime listed (as of this show&#039;s airing). All in all, I think this is a pretty good effort, style-wise.<br />
<br />
SOUND - 8/10:<br />
<br />
I watched the English dub. I thought the voice acting was good, the OST is solid and keeps the mood from the previous Magi seasons. Nothing mind-blowing, nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - 7/10:<br />
<br />
Just like the story section, I was a little disappointed with how easy things are for Sinbad. He literally pops out of the womb already OP - they actually have a scene where people around the world feel his presence through the rukh as he&#039;s born and say how he&#039;s going to change the world. I don&#039;t know where you go from there. The writer chose not to go very far at all. They just accept that Sinbad is a badass for life, and will power through any obstacle with ease. That tone might make for some cool moments or good wish fulfillment scenes, but it makes for boring character work. What we really want to see is Sinbad struggle a little. He shouldn&#039;t just innately be this person who is perfect in every way, wanting a peaceful world with no war, wanting to form his perfect country, understanding the ins and outs of trade, diplomacy, strategy, etc. I thought they were going to give us something good when Sinbad failed at trade upon first arriving in Rem. But no, the king of Balbad just hands him (literally) a win anyway.<br />
<br />
The reason I give this a 7 instead of something lower is because they actually do some interesting things with the minor characters. Sinbad is the constant, never really changing, but how people around him react or are affected does influence the show and its direction. Jafar, in particular, has some emotional advancements. Hinahoho struggles through feelings of inadequacy. Drakon and Sinbad have a good vibe going, until Drakon just leaves. I liked the queen of the amazonian tribe, I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing more of her around. She seemed to understand the djinn and rukh and everything a lot more than Sinbad does. So a strong secondary cast of characters helps save what is otherwise just a show about Sinbad showing off.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 8/10:<br />
<br />
Despite the negatives listed above, I still enjoyed watching this show. I powered through it in a couple days. I think a lot of that enjoyment is nested in nostalgia, as I did really enjoy the Magi series before this instalment. Despite a lack of Aladdin, Alibaba, and Morgiana, this still definitely feels like a Magi show, and if you enjoyed the first two seasons, you&#039;ll probably enjoy this one too.<br />
<br />

    I will make this short and simple.<br />
I think this anime is good. it has all the main stuff that makes a good anime. story, characters, character development, ect. my only real issue is the writing, god the writing....<br />
<br />
Magi Adventures of Sinbad is literally written by a high schooler with the vocabulary of a gymnasium. The characters speak “simple” you definitely understand what’s going on at all times but alongside all of the plot there are some odd character behaviors that are a bit out of character, that is mostly in the villains that for no real good reason start helping Sinbad. <br />
<br />
that’s pretty much it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338215">
        Aside from those big issues it’s a great story about changing the world buy becoming a merchant? I definitely meant to make that a question because how dafaq did Sinbad come to major plot decision to ally with foreign nations and become a salesman, it was cool though so I’m not mad.<br />

    So to start with I&#039;ve never watched the other parts of the Magi series so I will be reviewing this as a stand alone story. I&#039;ve watched 10/13 episodes which I think is enough to share my review. My review will contain pacing spoilers.<br />
<br />
Characters: All characters are one dimensionally and/or tropey. There is no where near enough development to care much about any of them. <br />
<br />
Art: The art is enjoyable but the character designs can be bland.<br />
<br />
Sound: Serviceable. <br />
<br />
Story: The story points are interesting. Because of the way the story is told it becomes unenjoyable and the characters become cardboard. The story needed 50 episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278192">
        instead of 13. Watching this anime is like reading the summary of a story, you&#039;ll find out what happens to the characters but you won&#039;t care.

    Personally I am a big fan of the the manga Magi so my opinion might be a little bias. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story follows Sinbad during his childhood, every event that takes place has a correlation to how Sinbad becomes who he is and what he achieved. The way that the story is told is based on the largest events that connected Sinbad to those who would help him created the Seven Seas Alliance <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art-style is faithful to the manga and the animation is extremely smooth so it is definitely nice to watch. The only fault with the animation has to be what I like to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223524">
        call the &quot;slide-show&quot; effect, where during certain scenes they will use a single frame to display an action such as a &quot;sword-clash&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack in this anime is great, ti definitely builds excitement and comes on cue in all the right situations. The music style is a more modern music style rather than the orchestra that plays most of Magi&#039;s themes. That however isn&#039;t why I deducted a point, my reasoning is the limited amount of soundtracks in the anime, there is around 3-4 soundtracks that are repeated very often and while they are good, more variety would have created a different atmosphere during certain situations. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
The main issue with both the Magi Sinbad adaption and the main series adaption was the amount of details that they skipped and the events that they changed. In this particular series they continue the trend by skipping character development chapters all for the sake of maintaining the action through a small 13 episode series. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Seeing a younger version of Sinbad is definitely fun and intriguing especially since I am keeping up with the main manga. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I loved the series and would definitely love to see a season 2. The way that they end the series leaves an opportunity for a season 2 and even gives a glimpse of events that would take place in the future.

    Firstly, I watched this before watching any of the others since it&#039;s listed as the prequel, whether that takes some enjoyment away I&#039;m not sure, but I was still really happy with it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s the story of Sinbad&#039;s beginning;<br />
We start off with little Sinbad, his birth and then it goes to showing him causing trouble for his dad. The beginning has lots of feels, so be prepared. <br />
The character style is great, they&#039;re very individualized, colourful and fit really well in the style of the anime.<br />
I loved Sinbad as soon as I met him.<br />
<br />
Sinbad comes across his new comrades in unusual ways, but they make great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236350">
        friendships. <br />
He doesn&#039;t want any more people to suffer the way he has, he&#039;s resolved to change it all, to bring everyone happiness. It&#039;s just going to be a difficult road for him to get there but he&#039;s prepared for that.<br />
<br />
He starts on his quest to capture dungeons and gain their powers and treasures. <br />
The story is really interesting, it&#039;s battles of Kings, gaining powers, traveling to different villages and laughs along the way. It has a very Aladdin-esque feel, which really helps the fantasy/magic genres.<br />
It&#039;s not always serious, there&#039;s a good mix of humor that really fits in. <br />
I really enjoyed it, watching them all adventure together, become closer as friends and Sinbad working and getting closer to his goal. <br />
Ja&#039;far, Hina and Mystras are great matches for Sinbad. They all compliment each other really well. <br />
<br />
Episode 12 would probably be my favourite. ;)<br />
I was hoping this would be good and it exceeded my expectations, I really enjoyed it and I can&#039;t wait to watch the rest of the series. <br />
If you like fun adventures, you&#039;ll love this.

    Magi: Sinbad no Bouken<br />
<br />
I&#039;d like to introduce you, the show that has been pretty much ignored in the mainstream shounen genre, while still has its loyal fanbase, it has been ignored by a lot of people of the modern generation (2020+).<br />
<br />
Magi: Sinbad no Bouken is a prequel to the much earlier released Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. It shows the adventures of Sinbad, Met with a lot of scenarios, challenges, and happenings that He constatly overcomes. Like He says himself; &quot;Don&#039;t be frightened by the waves. If we read the flow of the waves and accept them, we can overcome it. There&#039;s no wave that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397027">
        can&#039;t be&quot;. Moving on to the review<br />
<br />
The intro is fascinating giving us a feel of the emotions that is flowing in our main character Sinbad, a mix of hatred and hope, determined to change the world. The intro accomplishes all of its aspects, great introduction of the key characters, sequence and a feel for the pace of events, and most important of all is the reason for a goal. I always remind myself when watching action anime that; &quot;The battle is only measly important than seeing what you are fighting for&quot;. The anime is not just throwing out battles like there&#039;s no tomorrow, every fight has a sense, a goal, a purpose. There are a lot of shows that throw in battles just because they are awesome to look at, for example tournament arcs.<br />
<br />
Going through a different topic the show doesn&#039;t heavily rely on plot armor but more on a sped up timeline. Not showing any training arc whatsoever while still have some evidence that they have trained off-screen. All of the battles so far have reasonable outcomes, it happened unbiased to the mc, and well looked very natural. No burst of friendship power or anything like that that gives you some sort of red aura that gives off high physical prowess and some fox claws. yea.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the adventure part where it puts all of its efforts in. The mere concept of the series is Sinbad going to an adventure to change the world so pretty much the main goal is making the adventure exciting and enjoyable. This is accomplished by making Sinbad go through countries/places that have peculiar people/creatures. All having unique cultures and beliefs making it feel all new and exciting. <br />
<br />
Wrapping this review up I really enjoyed the show. Finished it with one go which I don&#039;t actually do often. It gives off a feel of sudden disappointment since it didn&#039;t really show a lot when it should (well maybe in the sequels but who knows). I don&#039;t understand how and why people rate the show though since in MAL this series is put off as 7.89 (as the time of writing) which is pretty underrated if I say so. Well different people may see different things so there&#039;s that but I would think that the majority would atleast rate it an 8.<br />
<br />
And goes the question, Do I recommend this? <br />
<br />
Yes, it&#039;s lighthearted on telling a story so it&#039;s easy to absorb, also being a long time premiere shounen of the past it&#039;s a good way to start your otaku life, either a casual watcher or an avid fan of the industry would likely still find themselves love this and indulge in. You may also consider watching this show only after watching the 2 other Magi Sequels that was released on an earlier date which is weird but the goal is probably to give it a flashback and looking at the past vibe. <br />
<br />
9/10

     Magi Sindbad no bokuen is a series that in a couple episodes does the impossible. In a short life spend of only 13 episodes we live through the history of Sindbad from a young father loving child to kid with high hopes and finally to wise cracking leader standing in a hall of fame. This life story is done by other series like naruto and one piece, but in my opininion less effective and far longer. Magi Sindbad no bokuen has beautiful colors and very vibrant animation. While you watch you are truly feeling the power grow of not only him, but other characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336349">
        as well. Writing is on point with more comedy anime like  nichijou or yahari ore no. I truly recomend this series to everybody, maybe it is left open with room for second season, but you won&#039;t regret.

    Magi: SnB (or SoB because it has an alternate meaning) is an extension of the original Labyrinth/Kingdom of magic which, for reasons both because of and beyond me, I liked much more. That being said, this show also has some.... eh.... ego problems. To elaborate, Sinbad is OP, the show knows this, doesn&#039;t do anything about it and instead puts him on this massive f*cking pedestal screaming &quot;Look what we made, we&#039;re so good&quot;... Well Magi, there are a number of reasons for you being just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
Having recently watched the first season of Magi (LoM), I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect from this prequel

        of sorts. On one hand, it could have been a load of pandering and displays of power, on the other, it could have been an onslaught of politics and sweet-talking.<br />
<br />
You get both.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story-<br />
Magi has an overlaying issue where the hero is given this massive plateau of power and free access. He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and be as crude as he likes but never suffers the consequences. It goes without saying that no story is without its hero but no hero is without a burden. Likewise, every hero struggles, for that is what makes him a hero over a simple opportunist. Now, I could have just pulled those quotes out of my ass, or, I could be on to something. Regardless, Magi seems to struggle -ironically- to establish a protagonist who himself struggles and as a result, our hero is depicted as nothing more than an opportunist with a very big mouth.<br />
<br />
Narrowing down the previous paragraph, Sinbad is given somewhat of a silver spoon from birth. Being labelled the &#039;miracle child&#039; who grew up in a poor village, he grows up to be both a powerhouse, wealthy business owner and a kings candidate. But you see, these are just titles, Sinbad, from episode 1, does not struggle. You could argue that his starting conditions could count as struggling but even at this stage, he has the power to take out groups of people and claim powers not even armies could claim. Why? because he&#039;s the miracle child? because he&#039;s the protagonist? because he was born that way? Who can tell, all I can say is that we are given the impression that Sinbad is leagues ahead of anyone else on the planet despite not having anything accept his determination... and I don&#039;t think that establishes a very balanced story.<br />
<br />
On a positive note, the story is much more engaging than that of the first season of Magi. While there is no &#039;struggle&#039;, we do get to see the plots of all of Sinbad&#039;s generals play out and in turn, watch them develop. The exploration and development of the world and its leaders is much more engaging and deserves credit. Likewise, the gradual progression of Sinbad&#039;s assets is a fun observation that we are regularly reminded of whenever a milestone in the story is reached and it gives us that sense of progress that we never really had in Magi: LoM.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Sound-<br />
Magi: SoB has a very standard art style yet does an amazing job of establishing atmosphere. This is critical when you establish your show on exploration and make your protagonists dream to be to &#039;have an understanding of the world&#039; and SoB does this really well. Sound wise, we don&#039;t have all that much to say, we got the decent application and a few good mood setting jingles but overall, I wasn&#039;t too fond of it. That is subjective, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character-<br />
I realise that I unloaded a lot of &#039;character&#039; stuff in the story section so, bar a few sentences about Sinbad, I will talk in a relatively broad manner.<br />
<br />
Sinbad is a powerhouse, he has a childish personality that suits him way better in this show than it did in Magi: LoM. Likewise, you get to see a lot of Sinbad in action. Simply put, he is a bad ass, and the anime makes sure you know it. One thing I did find annoying was that there was quite a bit of conflict over whether Sinbad was a quirky, ignorant and bold character (as portrayed by his seductive side) or an intelligent and quick thinking bad ass (as portrayed by his warrior/politician side) and this kind of creates a two-faced character that doesn&#039;t acknowledge this fact.<br />
<br />
As for the other generals, their nature is very well cemented and their personalities are consistent throughout. One thing I will say about them is that despite their entertaining and unique nature, their development basically ends the moment they join up with Sinbad. No adaptation. No evolution. Well... maybe there is a tiny bit for the assassin kid but that&#039;s kind of the one apple in a barrel of oranges.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment -<br />
I must say, I actually really enjoyed this anime. Despite the fact that the conclusion was left wide open and there wasn&#039;t really all that much of an end of season pay-off, the journey was still fun and there was enough going on (as well as enough nods to LoM) to justify watching it, not to mention liking it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion -<br />
I recommend that you watch this. It can be debated over whether or not you need to watch LoM to understand this season but despite a few unanswered questions and no telling where Sinbad ends up, there is plenty of material here to justify treating it as a prequel, maybe even an independent story, that you can watch right off the bat. I would really enjoy a follow up to this season, unfortunately, it tells a story that goes in hand with the &#039;real&#039; story involving Alibaba... which is a shame because I honestly thought this story was much more interesting.

    so i just wanted to say that i had enjoyed this spin-off of the original magi more then the original just becouse it was alot less confusing, i just wanted to say that i did enjoy the original magi but it was quite a strugle i think it took me around a year of trying to watch original.<br />
<br />
if you have not started to watch magi you might start off by watching this because its only 13 ep of you can watch the ova verson (4eps) that i have not watch and dont want to because its the same thing as this maybe less enjoyable tho.<br />
<br />
unfortunately

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262496">
        i dont think there will be a second seasson of adventures of sinbad.<br />
<br />
i can not make a deeper review comparing and contrasting this with the original because i dont have the fresh emotions after watching the original becouse i have finaly managed to watch it about 8 months ago

    Short description: It&#039;s Magi so it&#039;s always gonna be a good anime. But compared to the other seasons I have to say it&#039;s unsatisfying. This season should&#039;ve told us a lot more about Sinbad&#039;s past and his crew members (or at least to have more consistent action scenes) and try less to make random jokes for an entire episode (episode 12 was barely watchable).<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start of by saying that I really like the Magi series and I think that it&#039;s a unique anime with an outstanding plot, although I think it lacks pace, consistency and more and better battle scenes.<br />
<br />
This season focuses on what I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251121">
        presume will be the main antagonist of the series (didn&#039;t watch the manga but it has been hinted pretty obvious). I think Sinbad shares a lot of similarities with Itachi from Naruto, but with different outcomes. Both we&#039;re born prodigies and both have a life dictated by faith. While we found out that Itachi was a good guy who sacrificed his life for a greater good, Sinbad seems a good guy with noble intentions who will &quot;probabily&quot; turn to the dark side.  I personally loved Itachi from the begining, but I hated Sinbad from the begining, since he seems like an arrogant prick.<br />
<br />
Anyways, enough with comparisons, which many might not agree. Regarding this particular season, I was hoping to get to see how Sinbad conquered ALL the towers, which to my regret I didn&#039;t. I was hoping to see more consistent and more long lasting battle scenes, since he is the most OP character in the series. My favourite moment was when he scared off king Darius with his Bararaq Saiqa.<br />
<br />
Score: Why not heigher than 8? <br />
I can&#039;t go any highger.It was more about trading, travelling and &quot;fun times&quot; and less about the actual plot.<br />
<br />
Why not lower?<br />
This is a tough one, since I&#039;ve complained this much. Maybe cause it&#039;s Magi, maybe cause I&#039;ve been wanting to find out more about Sinbad, even though I didn&#039;t find as much as I hoped for. Treat my review as a 7.5 if u will.<br />
<br />
Final notes: Maybe I&#039;m being too harsh but that&#039;s because I really like this anime and I think the plot is there for an outstanding anime and I hope they will bring they A game with their following seasons.<br />

    Backtracking this series, I think I watched this in 2018/2019. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t remember much of this series apart from where MC enters a dungeon and fights his pursuers while also maintaining a good standing with the dungeon spirit thing. <br />
<br />
This series is very interesting and this specific installment doesn&#039;t fall short on an interesting plot. MC is restricted to the slums he and his mother live in but he is encouraged to join the hunt for pursuing the many treasures of the dungeons after she passes away in her bed of sickness; as well as a friend that somehow <br />
teleport in and out of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327930">
        world when he is needed by MC. He also had a childhood friend that turned out to be of royal descent, that left what was left of his family when they were both younger; which further encourages his pursuit of the dungeon. <br />
<br />
The character development is fairly decent, I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s flawless but for a shorter installment, it works well with the setting. The adventure wasn&#039;t uncommon but it was executed in a magi-style story line.

    I loved it!  I have just recently finished this 3rd season and deeply enjoyed it.  From the story to characters each left me with a unique vibe from other anime i have already seen.  I think it was a good idea to follow these 3 season in the order of Labyrinth -&gt; Kingdom -&gt; Sinbad. I understood what was going on from going in order.
