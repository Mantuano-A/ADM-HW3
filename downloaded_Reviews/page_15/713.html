    I don&#039;t write reviews often (or at all) but thought I&#039;d leave one for Gakuen Babysitters.  I spent 2 years in Japan working with kids aged 0-3 and this show brought back so many memories.  It really is quite spot-on with the behaviour and stereotypes of the Japanese toddlers.  Rules and regulations are far more relaxed in Japan compared to, say, North America, so this anime gave a fairly accurate portrayal of what life is like in a Japanese daycare.  Mind, the head teacher sleeping so much may be a slight exaggeration.. XD<br />
<br />
While a bit biased due to my own past

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275071">
        experiences, this show does offer a refreshing take on the SoL genre.  Would recommend to anyone in childcare, lots of entertaining quirks and relative topics.

    We’ve all been through a phrase where we were once a kid and behaved exactly as one. It’s human nature and God gave us a life to be part of society. What does that mean for a show like Gakuen Babysitters? The real question here if you ever felt experienced the feel of responsibility. No, I’m not talking about doing the chores and helping around the house. I’m talking about taking care of someone else in your life, perhaps a stranger or someone much younger than you are. Welcome to the world of Gakuen Babysitters.<br />
<br />
I should say right off the bat that the show is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274991">
        exactly what it looks like. Translated as “School Babysitters”, the series is about taking responsibility and being able to take care of kids. I’ve never took the task of caretaking before so watching this show felt like a refreshing experience to me. As a reader of the manga, this anime does what it has to do get its message across and that’s to deliver an experience about taking responsibility. <br />
<br />
The first few episodes lets the audience know about the situation of the protagonists, Ryuichi and Kotarou. Their parents died and with no place to be called home. Morinomiya Academy’s chairwoman decides to give Ryuichi a home along with free schooling in exchange for taking on the role of a caretaker. Now I have to admit, such a premise sounds like a potential moody story for tearjerking moments. However, the show really isn’t but instead formulated into a heartwarming lighthearted story. Ryuichi is really someone that’s kind hearted and has a bottom to earth type of personality. The show chronicles his life as a babysitter as he learns the ins and outs. While I can’t say there’s anything exceptional about him, it’s shown that Ryuichi is an incredibly helpful individual and puts others before himself. You’d think that after losing their parents, he would venture down a path of depression. No. Here, this guy makes a huge comeback after life knocks him down and it’s inspirational. Sometimes though, I feel like his personality is too friendly and can get him into unintentional trouble. Similarly, his brother sees the joy of life. While Koutarou is nowhere near as mature, he’s definitely a kid who is growing up in the right way.<br />
<br />
As I’m watching more and more of Gakuen Babysitters, I realized that the show really tried to make us experience something. The realism of being responsible is part of growing up and this show really feels like one to capitalize that. Besides just the Kashima brothers, we also meet other caretakers at the school. Most of their circumstances are in a better position and they have more experience than Ryuichi. Despite that, they get along fairly well with him because of his gentle personality. On the other hand, Ryuichi does meet someone at school with an underwhelming impression of him. Her name is Maria Inomata and it won’t take for viewers to quickly realize her blunt personality. Compared to others, Inomata is someone that is hard to get along with. She is extremely serious and dedicated to studying (as she claims as one of the most important things in life). However, she also gets involved with the kids at the caretaker after unusual circumstances and shows a much more caring side. The easy picture to look at is Ryuichi’s influence on her. She begins to realize that life is more than just about studying but also being responsible. Watching her development is one of the dynamics of this show as it shows how people can change. Similarly, Ryuichi learns a lot from his daycare duties and if I were his parent, I’d be damn proud of him.<br />
<br />
Featuring a cast of younger characters, Gakuen Babysitters does its best to create an atmosphere of innocence and youth. The kids in this show are very young and behaves in ways you can easily guess. Some of the things they say can be misunderstood or brutally honest. Because of their age, you can expect a lot of shenanigans in their daily lives. Characters such as Taka, Kirin, and even Koutarou can cause trouble despite being unintentional. It’s such traits that make them kids. Despite that, I find this cast to be very charming and realistic. Their attachment to their older siblings and parents is also heartwarming to watch once you understand them more. <br />
<br />
Similar to the manga, the anime adaptation follows more of a slice of life storytelling so you really shouldn’t expect a complicated story. Every day is an adventure of its own. Because the show takes place at school, you can also expect some drama to develop between the older characters. A prime example is Inomata as feelings are developed about Ryuichi. While this show isn’t a love story, it gets more and more obvious. While I can’t say the show is really well written in that respect, it does capture the feel of what school life is like for girls of her age. At the caretaker center, Ryuichi’s bonds with others is perhaps a key selling point of the show. He is able to earn the trust of the kids and other caretakers. However, the story itself still needs a lot of work. I’ve read the manga and as a 12 episode TV anime adaptation, it felt like a lot was missing. There’s also some uncomfortable moments in this show that ventures into controversial territory. (I’m looking at you Tomoya Yagi) The overall tone of the show can also be a bit dull once you realize it’s not the type of anime for you. It’s a blend of slice of life and shoujo so be aware of what’s ahead.<br />
<br />
Adapted by Brain’s Base, this show is an example of a realistic slice of life. While the raw visual quality isn’t overly impressive, every character in the show can be relatable and their character designs is an example of that. The kids are adorably charming and their character expressions is exactly how they should behave. Character chemistry is imperative to capture the mood of the show and thankfully, Brain’s Base and the director is able to meet such expectations. Some characters’ designs definitely stand out more than others such as the school chairwoman and her signature hair. To say the least, the artwork gets the job done and not be overlooked.<br />
<br />
To portray such a younger cast takes skill and thankfully, the VA skillfully does just that. From crying to the happy moments, every child in this anime make us believe that they are real. The students at the school all have their own personalities as the VA easily fits into their shoes. The only character that I have a problem with in this anime is Yuki. She’s the annoying type of school girl that I can’t stand and seems to be just there to make everything looks more than silly than it is. Compared to other characters, she isn’t likable and sometimes, I find the kids to be more mature than she is because of her personality. On the other hand, the theme songs in this anime is definitely appealing to watch with its pure innocence. The catchy and lighthearted tone of the soundtrack is also easy to get used to.<br />
<br />
After watching Gakuen Babysitters, I can easily say that the show can be recommendable to almost everyone. It’s probably targeted to a more specific demographic but anyone should be able to watch this with an easy and open mind. From its daily slice of life adventures to the charming character chemistry, this is a show that tells what heartwarming is really about.<br />

    Spoilers up to episode 4: Dropped<br />
<br />
Gakuen Babysitters is unsettling. There is no denying it teaches awful life lessons. To summarize why I dropped it; it’s a show about a kid who has to take care of babies, but it somehow fails at this easy plot conceit. It tries to teach the audience life lessons about responsibilities that come with growing up. Yet at the same time it is weirdly creepy.<br />
<br />
What makes it so unbearable:<br />
1. There’s a pedophile side character who gets nosebleeds when he sees the babies. His name’s Yagi he’s disgusting. He belongs in a show like Hajimete no Gal, not an anime about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269931">
        a daycare. It’s good that the other characters call him out for being a weirdo but why does he exist? I would have been fine if the show called him a weirdo and ended got rid of him, but he’s ”cute” recurring comic relief. He’s in the opening too so he’ll show up in later episodes. <br />
<br />
2. A shady hooded character is seen spying on the babies then is later revealed to be one of their fathers. Said father is an actor who played a kidnapper in his recent movie, therefore, his kid wasn’t afraid of him… A kidnapper. Let that sink in. The reason why the kid wasn’t afraid was that his mother showed him the movie and her reason for showing him something horrible like that she thought he looked cool in the role... AS A KIDNAPPER! It was like the show was teaching kids to not be afraid of kidnappers. This crosses the line between shockingly moronic writing into a dangerously stupid territory. The show is clearly targeted at kids so why doesn&#039;t it realize it&#039;s sending a message like this?<br />
<br />
3. One of the main characters classmates wacks his little brother. His baby brother. This wasn’t as big of an issue as the previous ones, but it was the icing on the bad life lesson cake that the show feeds to the audience. <br />
<br />
If I had known Gakuen Babysitters had so many off-putting creepy aspects, I wouldn’t have bothered to watch it. If you still aren’t off-put by the terrible morals, then at least you’ll enjoy the cute babies and occasional but well-handled drama segments. But I’m dropping it. How to Keep a Mummy is basically the same thing as this, except better. The writer of that show is actually aware of their audience and offers an adorable slice of life with much better vibes. Only show this to your kids if you want to traumatize them.

    Now that 4 episodes have aired, I can redo my review, but keep it true to what I originally had it as. I don&#039;t typically write reviews because I don&#039;t see the point. I can&#039;t describe it as well as others and most of the time the things I loved/hated have already been commented on in more detail than I could ever have written. But not for this one. Not this time. TLDR at the end. <br />
<br />
Gakuen Babysitters is fantastic. It is by no means thought-provoking or action-packed. It does exactly what it sets out to do: be a relaxing and sweet anime about children

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269921">
        and their families or, in some cases, what is left of them. If you&#039;re expecting more than that then I&#039;m sure that you&#039;ll be disappointed. This is Winter seasons &quot;I&#039;ve had a long day and I hate everyone,&quot; anime. Sit down, watch kids do stupid things and be adorable, and relax. <br />
<br />
The 3rd episode introduced us to this &quot;pedophile&quot; character as some people have described him as. I saw him as weird, but not once did he seem like a pedophile. His nose bleeds when he&#039;s around the children because they&#039;re adorable and he strains himself. People tend to forget that nosebleeds are from being overly excited and because the anime industry consistently uses nosebleeds as a &quot;sexual desire&quot; indicator. Yeah, no, you can get a nosebleed from strenuous activities such as being overly excited or being stressed. I&#039;ve seen a friend get a nosebleed because he was extremely pissed. Was he turned on? No. Is the character in the show turned on when he looks at the kids? No. The human body creates nosebleeds when the body undergoes a certain amount of stress. I know all the anime industry shows is nosebleeds when they&#039;re sexually interested but please take the time to research other causes of nosebleeds. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m sexually excited when I wake up in the morning and have a nosebleed from the stress of the dry season. If you remove the nosebleed from his character, does it change anything about the way he behaves with them? No, it really doesn&#039;t. If you saw him without the nosebleed, what would you think? &quot;Oh, he just really likes kids!&quot; That is what I see. I&#039;ve yet to see him display any pedophilic behavior but it&#039;s immediately written as such simply because of the nosebleed cliche. I want to see this sexual nosebleed cliche end and I&#039;m hoping this character is a step towards that. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for an actual pedophile character, watch Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai and then come back to this anime. They actually legit had him stalking her, taking pictures of her, and drooling over her. He completely wanted to be with her in every way imaginable and it was &quot;totally okay.&quot; Which one is the pedophile? The one who wants to pinch their cheeks and watch them be adorable or the one who wants to drool over a 10 year old in a bikini and act like it&#039;s totally okay for him to want to have sex with her?<br />
<br />
I really think this anime has the potential to break our hearts. It shows itself as just a nonsense anime about children and their activities, but then it takes a dark turn and reminds us that the protagonists parents are dead. It is not just about comedy, but the tragedy of loss and how it can affect the human mind. I enjoyed the 4th episode very much as we saw a side of our protagonist that we hadn&#039;t seen before. He&#039;s lonely. Jealous, even.  He has the kids but what about people his age? He has the duty of the babysitting club but what about his own interests? I want to see them expand upon this unless the babysitting club will just be full of people by the end of the anime. Either route will do. Every character is interesting and I hope to see them continue to grow and heal. <br />
<br />
TLDR: The character is not a pedophile. Nosebleeds are caused by being overly excited, not only from &quot;sexual desire&quot; like the anime industry tries to say. I&#039;ve been fangirling over how cute the kids in this anime are and I&#039;ve easily wanted to pinch their cheeks the same way. Am I a pedophile? No, they&#039;re just really cute. Get over it. If the character chooses to slowly devolve into what everyone assumes he is, then I will happily delete this review. Until then, I am getting serious grandparent vibes from him. Odd? Yes. Far too happy? Yes. Pedophilic? No. I have high expectations for this anime and they have been fulfilling them quite well.

    A trend I find with children in anime is that they&#039;re always painted &#039;cute&#039;.  Small human beings surrounded by glittery and sparkly effects who do cute things so that the audience falls in love with the tiny people characters.  It&#039;s not often that I see children portrayed as what they actually are, monsters, and it&#039;s even stranger to see a more realistic representation portrayed in a shoujo series of all things, a genre where virtually everything is depicted a lot more flowery than they actually are.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Kashima Ryuuichi and his little brother Kotaro have met with the unfortunate fate of becoming orphans after their parents passing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275013">
        due to a plane crash.  It is then that the boy is contacted by the headmistress of the high school that he will be attending, and told that from that day forward, he will live with her with room and board all taken care of, but in exchange, he must spend his spare time at the babysitters club, a daycare center at school dedicated to the teachers&#039; children while their mothers work.<br />
<br />
The show is pretty standard for what one can expect from a shoujo-style slice of life.  The story is very lax in nature with the only real high points being slight bumps that get resolved in the episode, thus leading to the show&#039;s mostly episodic nature with very few connecting points.  The episodes are based around Ryuuichi and his relationships with both the people he meets at school and the children in the daycare center, without really much weight to them since the show ends up going back to the status quo and resetting all but a few plot elements that don&#039;t get touched very much in the later episodes.<br />
<br />
But there are some points that I found irritating, mainly the fact that the parents of our two main protagonists ARE DEAD.  It is the story of a four year old and a fifteen year old entering a stage in their life with their parents just recently deceased.  Yes, this is a happy go lucky slice of life show, but you cannot ignore this looming fact.  They do touch on this point a fair bit in the early episodes, but it felt like it was played off and largely ignored in sacrifice to showcase Ryuuichi playing with kids, which does not feel right considering how heavy of a topic this is.<br />
<br />
Another more glaring problem is the romantic subplot.  There are two girls in this show that seem to have an interest for Ryuuichi, and everything about their interactions with him feels so unsatisfying, as these scenes feature either a tsundere who does the classic tsundere thing of being a bitch before regretting it later because that&#039;s apparently how people work, and a super shy girl who very clearly has a crush on the guy, but never gets the time of day because the show&#039;s not about her, but we still have to know she exists anyway.  The subplot eats up a surprising amount of the show&#039;s time and while none of the runtime is really lost since the episodic episodes featuring the children are wrapped up well enough to not warrant me yelling at Brain&#039;s Base for wasting time, I can&#039;t help but feel cheated because they set up the potential romance only to have it not go anywhere because audiences apparently like unresolved plot points/ideas.<br />
<br />
Overall, Gakuen Babysitters is pretty much a show that&#039;s what you get on the box.  It&#039;s a show about a guy babysitting kids with the occasional funny thing happening cause it&#039;s a slice of life comedy show that entertains.  It wraps itself neatly at the end to show how far the two brothers have come, as a sort of recap episode to show the fruits of the labor the entire runtime has built up to, but largely what you&#039;re going to be seeing here are &quot;School babysitters&quot;.  Babysitters who babysit at school.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/-  Pretty much what you&#039;d expect with the title of the series<br />
+  Has some heartwarming moments<br />
-   Romance goes nowhere, so why even include it in the first place<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Ryuuichi is about as interesting as sandpaper.  He cares very much for his little brother (to be to an obsessive degree for various reasons), and is extremely passive, being far too nice to everyone and not getting upset in the slightest.  Honestly there&#039;s not much to say about this guy cause weirdly enough, he&#039;s not involved with the plot all that much despite being the protagonist and the story beyond the first few episodes doesn&#039;t do much to shed light on the reality of him now being an orphan despite a few choice moments.  Kotaro is sort of an off-branch of his character since the two in the show are basically inseparable, and Kotaro on his own doesn&#039;t really have any traits of his own either cause the kid is usually silent with this perpetual bored expression that makes me question whether or not he knows what&#039;s even going on in his life.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;re the kids.  Who, if you know what kids really are like, will probably be reflective in your experience with them.  Simply put; they&#039;re loud, they&#039;re jerks, they do whatever the hell they want, and they can be cute.  Sometimes.  As the core of the show&#039;s existence, the six children featured in the show each take turns and sometimes altogether being the show&#039;s focus (some more than others), taking the protagonist and various members of the side cast along with them on their little adventures doing what children do.  The brat, the girl, the twins, Kotaro, and the baby; I have my own gripes with each of the kids, as their actual characters are something of personal preference, but I have to say they did a good job at showing their audience what snot-nosed brats children are actually like most of the time.  So I guess they did get the important thing right.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast involving recurring characters like Kamitami Hayato and Yoshihito Usaida, two characters who are commonly seen around Ryuuichi, the childrens&#039; parents, and other members of the side cast all weirdly enough have more personality than our main protagonist in that they fill in the gaps to enrich the world surrounding Ryuuichi with people who&#039;re more experienced with the other kids in the series, being family members and other people who simply have been around the children longer to be able to handle the little headaches much easier.  The outliers to this rule are Inomata Maria and Ushimaru Yuki, both of whom are the girls that seem to catch Ryuuichi&#039;s fancy, but don&#039;t do anything about it cause even if you try, romance isn&#039;t wanted in this story.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Realistic depictions of toddler behavior<br />
+ Amusing sidecast (for the most part)<br />
-  MC&#039;s not very interesting<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Produced by Brain&#039;s Base, Gakuen Babysitters focuses more on the light aesthetic with very few points of animation to take note of.  The show itself is very consistent with its art quality, vying for a simple style with pastel colors that emulate the show&#039;s normally cheery and bright nature cause the show isn&#039;t a slice of life shoujo for nothing.<br />
<br />
Comedy is relegated primarily to very simple comedic faces that at times don&#039;t even feel like a real anime comedy cause nothing&#039;s exaggerated which I guess by extension makes it less intrusive on the situation as a whole.  Though I do question what kind of comedy can be derived from a family who disciplines their members with a sharp blow to the head.  I mean it&#039;s kinda funny, but it got kind of stale after the twentieth time they did it, which doesn&#039;t help when the Kamitami family has the most irritating child in the entire series as one of its members.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Consistent quality<br />
+  Soothing and simple style<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Both Daisuke Ono&#039;s &quot;Endless Happy World&quot; and Hyorotto Danshi&#039;s &quot;Oshiete yo&quot;, which is sung by the VAs of Ryuuichi and Hayato are both mellow songs that emulate the slice of life/happy go lucky tune that the show sings to featuring the day to day lives of looking after children who spend half their time drowning in their own imaginations playing.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, they&#039;re not really the most memorable tracks, but they do their job in emulating the feeling the audience is supposed to get when watching this series cause everything about these songs is meant to create the feeling of children having fun more than anything else.  Personally though, I&#039;m not much of a fan and I found them to be kind of generic and nothing really noteworthy.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Honestly, I watched this show more for the novelty of the idea more so than any interest in the show itself.  I sat there looking at &#039;Gakuen Babysitters&#039; and thought to myself what the actual hell they could do with a show as literally titled as this.  The show pretty much met my expectation on what I thought it was going to do, but kind of killed them at the same time cause the show&#039;s attempt at a romantic subplot was one of those things that shouldn&#039;t have been there, but surprise surprise, was there because why not.  I was actively upset at Yuki&#039;s lack of involvement in the plot because she kept showing up in the series with nothing of value to add with every appearance.  Which is sad because they try to mix her into everything by the end of the series and every fiber of my being was asking &quot;Why didn&#039;t you do this earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
But I think the one part of the show that irked me the most was Taka, Hayato&#039;s little brother and quite possibly the worst character in this entire show.  Simply put, he&#039;s a brat.  An annoying kid that spends the entire show trying to get his way and shove his way into everything without any acknowledgment for anyone else&#039;s thoughts or feelings.  I don&#039;t like him because not only is he an annoying character, but he reminds me of a member of my own family who is the exact same way, and that&#039;s not a fun comparison to think about when you&#039;re watching an episode of anime on Sunday night to relax dreading the coming week.<br />
<br />
But all in all, Gakuen Babysitters is a show that I felt was...alright, I guess.  I don&#039;t think it helps that I&#039;m not much of a shoujo fan, and the shoujo-style of storytelling isn&#039;t my favorite, so I think my enjoyment of the show would&#039;ve been skewed from the beginning.  If you&#039;re a fan of the shoujo genre and you got some time to kill, this would be a fun show to watch if you&#039;re trying to fill in time.  Just be prepared to turn down your volume at times cause like a real group of children, the kids in this show can get pretty loud, and Taka&#039;s voice is like cheese graters, so here&#039;s your early warning.

    The story is about two young...well one High School Student Ryuuichi and his VERY young brother Kotaro. These two brothers end up losing their parents in a plane crash and are sent to live with the Chairwoman of a high school. The reason being is that her Son and Daughter in Law were also in said plane crash and felt like it was necessary to take these two into her home. <br />
Of course the catch is for Ryuuichi to live in the house he must become part of the &quot;Babysitters Club&quot; in his High School. So basically the babysitters club is a club where the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275008">
        teachers leave their young kids who are not able to attend Pre or Elementary school yet. It&#039;s actually a pretty cool thing because it shows a development of Ryuuichi being accustomed to high school life, and Kotaro breaking out of his shyness being surrounded by kids his age and not being with his brother constantly.<br />
<br />
Along the way we get some awesome characters introduced in the show. Of course we get the kids in the Club, but we also get to meet the person in charge of the club when Ryuuichi is in class, the kids parents and Ryuuichi&#039;s classmates as well. The development and story over time in this series was really well done. At time you find yourself holding back tears, and other times you find yourself rooting for certain characters to come over there fear of doing something, for example just playing with the children.<br />
<br />
The art and animation were not anything special. Not the worst thing in this word since there&#039;s no action or over the top scenes. Considering this was a more relaxing anime the animation did not have to be top tier to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The sound was pretty average as well. I enjoyed the ending more then the opening, but that&#039;s not saying much since overall the ending was &quot;meh&quot;<br />
<br />
The characters were super enjoyable. From the teachers down to the Ryuuichi&#039;s classmates this was one awesome cast of characters. Even the kids were super enjoyable. When it came to the High school kids you could really relate to most of them especially if you have young siblings, or even issues when it comes to handling small children. I was constantly comparing myself to Inomata. While she enjoyed being with the children it was hard for her to control them or even understand them without making them cry or be hurt in the end. However over time she was able to better her self while spending more time with Ryuuichi and the kids.<br />
<br />
I found myself waiting patiently every Sunday afternoon so I could watch this anime. That is how much I enjoyed it. <br />
<br />
Overall this was a unexpectedly great anime. Even with the score it has now i feel like it super underrated and definitely overlooked. I think the title of the anime plays a huge role in that. I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who would like a break from anything serious or over the top and just enjoy a very conditional slice of life anime.

    This anime is so adorably fun to watch! The first and second episode made me excited to keep watching, but when I got to episode 3- I was sold! I was a bit nervous when I saw people reviewing negatively because of a potentially &quot;Pedophile-like&quot; character. I proceeded to watch with a friend and am STILL confused as to why people call this character a pedo.. He got a nosebleed around the small babies and became excited. That does not mean that he wanted to act out anything sexual.. It isn&#039;t just an anime thing when people get nosebleeds over getting excited. Some people can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269936">
        get them when their blood pressure sky rockets suddenly in real life too. This character was just excited to be around the babies and was just happy in general. So, I am still going to watch because the rest of the episode was simply adorable and so lovely. Episode 4 is even better than the last too! I adore this anime to bits :D

    this anime is a GODSEND! i&#039;ve watched it so many times i&#039;ve lost count!! it&#039;s such a cute and peaceful anime that i can&#039;t help watching whenever i&#039;m feeling depressed or anxious. it just takes my mind off of things and the plot doesn&#039;t drag on for long or make you lose interest.<br />
<br />
also, i love babies A LOT  so maybe that&#039;s why i&#039;m addicted to the anime? it&#039;s just so funny and lighthearted and such a nice change from action/romance/horror anime and i wish it was more popular because we NEED a season 2 already! <br />
<br />
very enjoyable, highly recommend it!

    Wow, this anime really melts your heart with cute and wholesome moments with life lessons as extra baggage. If you want a heartwarming anime then this is the one. <br />
<br />
The story is about two brothers Ryuuichi and Kotarou who just lost their parents in a plane crash, a stern chairwoman of an elite school who also lost her son and daughter in law in the same plane crash decided to take care of the two brothers who had nowhere else to go. In return, Ryuuichi had to take her off the babysitters club who had no club members and only one caretaker. He already had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380049">
        experience taking care of the kids as he took care of his brother Kotarou when their parents were on tour most of the time. Ryuuichi now goes to this new school in an unknown town with a job of taking care of his brother and the other kids in his spare time.<br />
<br />
This anime had amazing voice actors, great animation, great life lessons. The storytelling was not linear they just showed us wholesome moments in their life with a very subtle life story in the background. The atmosphere was always heartwarming, got some great characters, this is a happy anime.

    This anime is about two brothers named Ryuuichi  and Kotarou who lost their parents in a plane accident. Ryuuichi was a student of middle school 3rd grade and Kotarou was a boy of maybe of two years. They didn&#039;t had any relatives who can look after them. Then some one suggested him that there was a chairwoman of a school who was interested to take care of them. She will take care of them but in return he had to work as a babysitter in the daycare which was supposed to be known as babysitter club. Ryuuichi agreed with it and started a new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378869">
        life with new people. Ryuuichi and Kotarou had a deep relationship with each other. They never fought each other. Kotarou and Ryuuichi always wants to stay like this forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really loved this series because it described how an elder brother or sister should behave with their brothers and sisters. We have to be patient and accept what our siblings do. They don&#039;t mean harm to us. If they do anything that breaks our heart we have to think that it was an accident. We always have to love each other to make a peaceful life. <br />
<br />
My Ratings for this anime:<br />
Story - 10<br />
Art - 9<br />
Sound - 9<br />
Character - 9<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
Overall - 9

    I saw it, it was simple, yet effective. I won&#039;t lie, in the first episode, I went crybaby mode. If you haven&#039;t seen the series and you&#039;re just scrolling through the review section to know people&#039;s opinion, I highly recommend you to watch this show. I won&#039;t further extend my review because there&#039;s nothing really to talk about, instead, I&#039;ll give you three words to describe it. &quot;Inspiring, Cute, Euphoria&quot;<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s further talk about the elements. The story takes off after the sudden death of their parents, two young brothers named Ryūichi Kashima and his younger brother Kotarō are left alone and having no place to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325316">
        call home. The chairwoman of the prestigious Morinomiya Academy offers to take the boys into her care, giving them a new house and free tuition, but in a condition that Ryuichi helps out with the school&#039;s daycare center while also attending normal classes during school hours. It&#039;s unique in its own way, I haven&#039;t really found some plot holes so bare with me. I really liked the story.  That&#039;s all I can say since there are no flaws that are too serious about the plot.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the art is simple and VERY FITTING. Ryuichi reminds me of Kazehaya from Kimi Ni Todoke. He even has the same personality as him. Sweet and loving. And also attracted. At first, I didn&#039;t like the OP very much, but I grew fond of it after discovering the episodes step by step. The ED is fantastic and supports the series well, also, the OST fits the theme very well.<br />
 <br />
Further on, the characters. My personal favorite is the chairwoman, at first she seems infuriating, but oh boy I love her. Her hairstyle is unique which I haven&#039;t really seen in any other anime series. Ryuichi is the typical main character who is seen to be loved by girls. Inomata is my love-interest for Ryuichi, while Ushimaru can have Kamitani. By the number of characters, I can&#039;t compliment all of them but I&#039;d like say they played their roles very well.<br />
<br />
Okay onto enjoyment, did I enjoy this-? Well, two words. VERY MUCH.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Overall: 8.4/10<br />
Rounded Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
I highly recommend you to watch this, it&#039;s so exciting!! Thanks for reading my review!<br />

    So, this...<br />
<br />
To be honest, the only real reason why I watched this show is that I was really bored and while playing with the Crunchyroll app I found it.<br />
<br />
After ending the show I came to the realization that... it wasn&#039;t something special, in fact, I don&#039;t remember most of the names of the characters...<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Any dramatic set-up that the show could have is pointless because of the fact that the show doesn&#039;t really want to be realistic, so, any concept that could generate an interesting drama is resolved in minutes,<br />
<br />
so, instead of a coming-of-age history about a teen and his younger brother had to survive after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332024">
        the death of his parents, we received a happy-go-lucky full of fluff slice-of-life.<br />
<br />
The appealing of this show is good comedy and cute babies, and both of them aren&#039;t really strong.<br />
<br />
The &quot;funny scenes&quot; mostly joke that we have seen a lot of times in countless animes, this doesn&#039;t mean that occasionally a few jokes can make laugh, but they are really few and mostly played safe with the generic high-school set-up.<br />
<br />
Seeing the babies interact is cute in the first 3 episodes, then it became repetitive and monotonous.<br />
<br />
This show doesn&#039;t have a plot in another way to say it<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
They are the basic archetypes of the genre. I don&#039;t have a problem with archetypes if you do them good, but here is not the case.<br />
<br />
Not of the characters has a development or a distinct personality outside of his &quot;Joke&quot; that is supposed to represent. Maybe The main character and his brother could be a little interesting because of all that thing about the dead parents and... you know, shit that is supposed to be important in a coming-of-age history. But it is badly explored and is, mostly just an excuse for jokes and some meaningless drama in one of the episodes.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
Is ok.<br />
what? there&#039;s nothing special in the presentation, character design is average and the backgrounds look pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
The only thing is the occasional slapstick and some fluidized movement, but that&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
<br />
Voice acting is average, the theme songs for this are rather forgettable but fitting well with the feeling of the show.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
This show is the definition of generic, the characters are boring, any interesting part in the plot is treated as a joke and the animation is mediocre, is fairly entertainment as long as generic Slice-of-life goes, but is you are waiting... something good, this isn&#039;t for you.<br />
<br />
i don&#039;t recommend it at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />

    This is such a sweet and warm slice of life anime! I&#039;m sooo glad i watched it coz its been on my list forever!<br />
<br />
A story about two brothers survival after their parents death. its a 12 anime series where in every episode there are 2 short stories. It makes it a lot easier to digest and hang on to. <br />
<br />
The characters are sweet and cute most of them being babies&lt;3 the older cast is also pretty good. there is a hint of highschool romance and nostalgia. <br />
<br />
I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a everyday normal life obstacles and fun.

    Gakuen Babysitters is really cute for what it is. It&#039;s about babies. I’m not a baby person per se but babies are cute, and that’s the only cute thing about the whole show. Rest of the characters are as archetypical as they can get. The story thrives on cliché after cliché. In a nutshell the main focus of the show is sibling love between Kotaro and Ryuichiro. Of course such a setup always has potential if one wants to work with it. This is a slice of life theme that will never get boring. You know, babies grow up, they mature, brothers can drift apart,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401629">
        growing up is hard etc. etc. It’s supposed to be relatable.<br />
Except in Gakuen babysitter it’s just a superficial and cutesy shojo anime without any real substance. For those who enjoy these overused tropes all in one, it’s a nice time pass. <br />
There’s a stoic hot guy who constantly hits his 3 year old toddler brother. Yeah, he hits little toddlers. That’s supposed to be a gag btw. I’m just glad Kamitani is living in Japan where maybe it’s okay to harm kids because in my country you can literally go to jail. Yeah, no he’s quite serious when he hits them. Taka is his brother and the only fault is that he behaves like a toddler of that age. He’s not even that troublesome except for he’s loud and stupid. But hey, let’s laugh and swoon over Kamitani for abusing Taka mentally and physically. If this show was ever taken seriously it would have far more repercussions by mentally imprinting that behavior in little kids. I hop Taka doesn’t grow up being a dick, because the only thing he’d remember was his brother being a stoic asshole (dumbhole) who says he doesn’t love him and verbally hurts at every opportunity. <br />
Then there’s an archetypical cute guy pedo. Comedy again. I’m really sure he isn’t but that’s the gag and you’re supposed to get the humor mistaking him for being a pedo but he’s not. Oh wee haha how funny. Because there aren’t real pedos who have raped 3 months old babies.<br />
Yeah sometimes they just don’t know how to do comedy without being so gritty.<br />
There’s then, a paranoid father of Kirinchan, where you have to laugh when he flirts with minor school girls. Mom doesn’t mind obviously. <br />
Oh and this other guy who is in love with his teacher (yes in love). Omg so funny and cute. And we are supposed to take him seriously.<br />
Anyway even if you don’t, you have the googly eyed MC who for actuals god’s sake consoles this nut head and is apologetic as apologetic word can go. There’s no comedy except that something’s are just so weird. He feels bad for telling Kamitani not to hit his baby brother. In this one episode I wanted to throw off my cereal bowl at the screen. It was supposed to be a lesson for 3 year old Taka on how to behave and. Yes, I was expecting a deeper message like kids ruin your stuff but they grow up and stop needing you without taka having an idea exactly but holy it was an actual bad lesson for Taka.  . The kid bowls his eyes out saying he is sorry, but his older brother is cold as ice. And mother is useless. I feel like there’s not a fucking adult who knows how to deal with a situation involving a child. I’m pretty sure I’ve never seen anyone being so tough to a 3 year old baby for anything they do except calmly make them understand. But you don’t hurt a child, ever. In Gakuen Babysitters, they do.<br />
Not to mention that there’s absolutely no safety for the kids. The babysitter is almost always sleeping, the windows are open, kids just roam around in school with no supervision. <br />
Characters are dumb but not unbearable. <br />
Apart from that this anime was a nice time pass. You’re not supposed to take it seriously. Yeah I know I’m talking but I have to write fax in reviews so. <br />
Oh yes there’s a mandatory beach scene and boob press scene because….it’s wholesome that way <br />

    I started this anime out LOVING it, I really enjoy cute animes and this one seemed really good. The premise starts out a little sad but it starts picking up and becoming something cute and enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Then it hits episode 3 and we get a new character in the mix.<br />
<br />
He&#039;s explained as someone who&#039;s usually seen glaring at children, so I was wondering if it was another instance of someone disliking children, which is fine! I don&#039;t like children myself so I get it. However, we find out later, that&#039;s not the case. <br />
<br />
He&#039;s a pedophile, played for a joke. He stalks children because they&#039;re

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273224">
        soft and cute and he really likes them because &quot;he&#039;s a degenerate&quot;. And his pedophilia is played for a joke. The whole time. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t want to support an anime like that, so i dropped it immediately.

        After watching countless shows about ecchi and shounen I thought why not watch this show about babies. Seeing so many babies run around made me feel good, and when I mean good I mean GOOD. In the sense that they were cute and what not. Or as you people prefer to say: Kawaii. Anyway, let me move on into detail about why the rating I have given it is a below average 3.<br />
<br />
    The story is about high-school kid Ryuuchi and his brother Kotarou who get abandoned, but get adopted by some rich old hag with a cranky

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275198">
        attitude who just puts up the &#039;ol &quot;I&#039;m a big old mean lady and I hate everyone&quot; act and in truth is a nice &#039;ol tsundere archetype lady. The reason for their abandonment is so cliche and forced it feels completely unrealistic and lacking in emotional impact. Ryuuchi handles it well, but maybe it&#039;s because he doesn&#039;t give a crap about them or because it is irrelevant to the main plot about watching babies. Anyway, &#039;ol lady or chairwoman lady runs a school with a daycare club and has Ryuuchi run it as a babysitter during his off time from classes, which is then how we get introduced to the cute babies. <br />
<br />
    Most of the characters are bland archetypes we have seen already. Three examples being Hayato, the chairwoman, and butler guy. Hayato and Youko a.k.a chairowoman chick each have a competition with the audience to prove who is the most tsundere out of the anime. I&#039;d have to give it to Hayato since he seems like the tougher egg to crack. Butler guy is just your stereotypical anime butler guy - quite and useful. Although who would want a useless butler anyway. Moving on, there&#039;s a girl who craves Ryuuchi&#039;s dong as soon as he appears in class and some other tsundere girl who also craves it, but not as much.  Ryuuchi is alright, but his clinginess to his little brother Kotarou and how he makes Kotarou cling to him as well is quite annoying. Usaida or the first babysitter in the club is chill and probably the most likable of the cast, though his presence usually just consists of him sleeping.<br />
<br />
On to the baby tier list: <br />
S-tier : Kotarou<br />
A-tier : Kirin<br />
B-tier : Takuma and his crying brother (forgot his name) <br />
C-tier : weird-eyed toddler<br />
Shit tier : Taka<br />
<br />
The music is there... I think. If it was memorable or moving in some way I would have mentioned it by now.<br />
The anime felt more like a drag as I continued to watch it, but I still got some enjoyment from it. Only watch this if you like typical cute anime crap.<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
Art: 5 <br />
Sound: 3<br />
Character: 3 <br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
Overall: 3

    MINOR SPOILER WARNING - contains information from the first few episodes<br />
<br />
Gakuen Babysitters is an excellent anime to watch. The anime came out during a time when I was really getting back into anime, and was like a second gateway anime. It draws you in with its simple premise and story, and sticks to it throughout the entire show. <br />
<br />
The story of Gakuen Babysitters is very simple. Our main characters, Ryuichi and Kotarou, currently don&#039;t have a home due to their parents dying in a plane crash. The Academy Chairwoman decides to give the boys a home, and gives Ryuichi free education should he help at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306505">
        the school&#039;s daycare centre after school. However simple the premise is, it is able to constantly deliver on it, and shows us a great time that we can appreciate at home. <br />
There are many shows that have filler episodes to stretch an anime out, but this is a show that develops each of your characters at an excellent pace and in great ways. In every single episode, the simple story is progressed through, with problems being presented, and then solved in a timely fashion. <br />
<br />
However simple the art style and music are, they help to create a simple and ecstatically pleasing anime, showing off how not everything needs to be flashy or sparking to be attractive. The anime keeps everything nice and clean, with Brain&#039;s Base animating, keeping everything pleasing to look at. <br />
<br />
The show is an easy comedy and slice of life, and with a simple plot and excellent characters (even though they are 3 year olds!). It is something you can come home to and just sit and enjoy. Something pleasing to watch as you relax. <br />
<br />
Gakuen Babysitters is an excellent show, and although I won&#039;t speak for every single person, it is a really good watch. Set aside an afternoon, sit down with friends (or by yourself, I&#039;m not judging), and enjoy.

    This anime is too cute. I have read/been reading the manga, and it&#039;s quite similar, but of course there are some things that are not accounted for or rushed. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s basically a student in a babysitting club with his younger brother, a sweet and simple anime that is just too adorable. <br />
It is sometimes annoying because in the manga, you don&#039;t hear the children actually crying, but what can you do? <br />
The first few episodes were a real tearjerker (for me), which was quite surprising.<br />
<br />
Some say there&#039;s a pedophile character, but honestly this anime is really innocent and there is no &quot;hidden&quot; meanings. It is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269944">
        just a response to seeing something adorable. It is just a show on kids being cute and doing cute things. <br />
<br />
Story: 7, there&#039;s no real story, just a slice of life<br />
Art: 9, very cute, I love her art style and have read many other manga that she has drawn.<br />
Sound: 6, I dont hate the sound track, but it isnt great, perse<br />
Character: 8, there are few, but they are unique<br />
Enjoyment: 8, a good show to relax <br />
Overall: 8. It is a cute show about children, nothing more, nothing less<br />
<br />

    Gakuen Babysitters seemed like a decently good anime for me at the beginning. But as Gakuen Babysitters played out with more story clichés, and started making some parts unbearable, I stopped liking this anime that much.<br />
<br />
Story: (6/10)<br />
In this anime, all the episodes are disjointed and have no connection whatsoever with each other. The storyline in every episode is fine, I just felt that using clichés, such as the &#039;beach&#039; cliché degraded my experience with this anime. However, to make up for it, it has some well-thought out drama scenes. <br />
<br />
Art: (7/10)<br />
The art was decent and enough to discern most characters from each other. However, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275360">
        believe they could have still worked on making some characters not as noticeably similar in design.<br />
<br />
Sound: (5/10)<br />
The op and ed were just normal anime songs. However, none of the soundtracks themselves pop out and really give a special feel to the anime itself imo.<br />
<br />
Character: (4/10)<br />
At first I found the babies outright extremely cute. However, over time, the anime makers used the babysitters as a cheap way to cover up so many moments that could have been used to develop other parts of the story, becoming very annoying. The characters also are mildly disturbing, such as a father who dresses like a kidnapper, and a high school student who bleeds from excitement when seeing one of the babies.<br />
<br />
Overall: (6/10)<br />
Overall a decent anime that may or may not be worth your time. If you like babysitters and babies a lot, go for it. Otherwise, you should look for other slice of life animes instead
