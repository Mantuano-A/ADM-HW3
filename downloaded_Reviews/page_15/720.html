Give this anime about 2minutes, and you&#039;ll already be laughing your ass off. I&#039;m usually very picky with my comedy animes. I need them to be surprising, unique, and more than anything --weird. (Seriously...nothing normal is EVER FUNNY.)<br />

Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
What you get:<br />
<br />
- A tougher-than-anyone yankee<br />
- ...paired up with a Demon-Lord Baby (who is adorable)<br />
- ...and is perpetually naked.<br />
- A giant beefy man whose ability to transport people is nothing short of NUTS, not to mention GROSS and disturbing. <br />
- VERY easily distracted Demon-Lord-King who puts Mahjong over destroying the human race<br />
- AND MORE.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
Beelzebub is so evil AND cute you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34680">
        just want to squish him.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
It&#039;s good, what can I say other than that?<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
When a writer takes a Cliche and twists it into a product of Genius then you know you have a winner. The chemistry between the characters is also wonderful --especially between Beelzebub and Oga.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
It&#039;s funny, it&#039;s exciting, it&#039;s fast-paced, it&#039;s GOOOD.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
All right, there are probably funnier animes, but this is still one of the best. =D<br />

    Beelzebub is a genuinely funny anime. And I mean laugh out loud &#039;til your sides hurt sort of funny. You know you&#039;re in for a good time when we are introduced to the basic storyline in the first episode... a huge guy floating down the river spots a “handsome and good looking young man” &quot;who cared nothing for his follow humans&quot;. He proceeds to then bestow the green haired demon baby (Beelzebub) unto our protagonist, Oga Tatsumi, in one of the strangest fashions imaginable, before taking with an impressive ballerina pirouette. Hijinks ensue when the baby&#039;s beautiful demon maid servant, Hildegarde comes looking for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79322">
        toddler and finds him attached to Oga. Hildegarde is not impressed but is intent on forcing Oga to fulfil his contract with baby Beel. Oga spends many many episodes trying to pawn the baby off to someone more badass than himself while trying to keep his family, who comically misinterpret his situation, off his back, with varying degrees of success, and lots and lots of comedy. Along for the ride are Furuichi, Oga&#039;s best friend and the show&#039;s resident pervert, and a host of other delinquents from his infamous Ishiyama High.<br />
<br />
As you can probably tell, Beelzebub is a show that doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, and this approach works very well for the story being told. The main characters, particularly Furuichi, seem aware that they part of a show that routinely sets them up with ludicrous scenarios, as if to test their reactions, and they are not shy about calling out some of the more preposterous elements that arise. Characters also address the viewer directly, which adds a nice touch of humour to the show while making the situations more relatable. I found this approach more satisfying than one where we are asked to accept ridiculous circumstances at face value. <br />
<br />
The show has a lot of heart, and can also be surprisingly creepy at times; these are demons and the underworld we are dealing with after all, but this never lasts for very long, which is a pity because I think the show would have benefited from playing up the darker themes for longer periods to counter the otherwise jovial tone, which becomes a bit tiresome over a 60 episode arc. Still, the show maintains enough originality to entertain and the delivery of punch lines remains top notch for the most part. <br />
<br />
One place where the show does disappoint terribly is in character development. Its remarkable how little the main characters change over the course of the series. This actually turns out to be a main detractor for the comedy as the show goes on because I often found myself wishing for fewer farces and more feeling. Some decent character growth would have solved this issue, but alas there just isn&#039;t enough of that to go around. Relationships are especially frustrating. Waiting for something interesting to happen between characters other than fights with comically named &quot;special attacks&quot; is like watching paint dry; there just isn&#039;t a lot going on there. The supporting characters fare a bit better in this respect, in particular with an entertaining story arc involving a multi-player FPS.<br />
<br />
To add to this, the filler episodes quickly become an annoyance. Simply put, there are too many of them. This wouldn&#039;t be so bad if these episodes contributed something towards developing characters, however, they do not. And in the end I kept feeling like these episodes were simply taking away valuable time that could be better used oh say, developing characters.<br />
<br />
Overall though Beelzebub is a well written series which keeps track of its story plots, at least until the last episode, so you almost never see characters “forgetting they did something”, or acting out of character, which is very impressive for a farcical comedy like this. Eventually though, lack of character development and some nonsensical villains make it hard for me to call this anime great. Halfway through this series, if you&#039;re not being entertained by the humor, chances are you aren&#039;t being entertained by anything else. And this is unfortunate, because the show had all the right ingredients to make it absolutely amazing. Still, I would recommend watching the series because you will not regret doing so, if only because it is very different from a lot of what is out there. Moreover, I managed to find a much more satisfying end by basically ignoring the last episode and switching to the manga to get more out this series. The story of Beelzesama and his contractor Oga Tatsumi, does not end at episode 60, and for my money, is definitely worth catching up on.<br />

    Let&#039;s get right to the central point because I writing like short reviews.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re probably asking to yourself when picking up this Anime &quot;Will this make me laugh so hard I can&#039;t breathe?&quot;. The simple answer is YES and let me explain why.<br />
<br />
The names of the central characters the story of Beelzebub revolves around is Tatsumi Oga and Baby called Beelzebub. Tatsumi is a delinquent at the worst school in his area and Beelzebub is the son of a demon who was destined to take over the world. From there, wacky stuff happens in EACH EPISODE that will have you on the floor crying for laughter.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205770">
        Honestly, I would say that the story is of less importance than how the characters were executed since it is a comedy.<br />
<br />
Before watching Beelzebub, I didn&#039;t think that Anime could be so funny that I would consider it a masterpiece(This was also before I watched Gintama). Most Comedy Anime to me at the time seemed too tryhard/forced and that you would essentially need to be Japanese to laugh at the jokes. That all changed when I watched Beelzebub. I loved EVERY CHARACTER. Each of them had something to offer as a whole for the comedy so that nobody was left out. What would have played out as a normal thing in other Anime, Beelzebub turned on it&#039;s head into pure laughter. I don&#039;t want to spoil much but just keep what I said in mind because it&#039;s true.<br />
<br />
The music is pretty good also and each episode doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s dragging on. I honestly wish I could watch it all over again for the first time because I love it so much. It&#039;s up there with Gintama as the funniest Anime of ALL TIME.<br />
<br />
So just give it a try and see if you like it.

    I will not deny, I&#039;ll be a little biased towards this anime cuz my favourite genre is comedy and the supernatural, so this was quite the perfect show for me.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Once upon a time, in a land faraway, there was a barbaric, ruthless, defiant, demon-like bastard who thought nothing of his fellow man. And under some strange as heck circumstances, he started to raise a baby.<br />
<br />
Correction. Not just any baby. The next great demon lord!<br />
<br />
And so we follow this man, Oga and Baby Beel with their wacky so called &#039;adventures&#039;. The story&#039;s plot is not deep or anything, however it does feature something out of our

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34187">
        daily lives and the humor is hilarious. Oga is always dealing with weird situations (which I kind of feel sorry for him) and all of them have to do with Baby Beel. But there are certain moments in the story that will make you go &quot;aww&quot; just for abit as well. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is mediocre. But there are certain times where humorous exaggerated facial expressions are drawn very well which I will give a thumbs up for. They do have a little bit of fights, which are short enough and not too long.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP and ED suit the anime very much. OP is a kind of rock-ish song which is kind of catchy and the lyrics are all of Baby Beel&#039;s words while ED is slightly more toned down and mature. The background music in each and every episode is fufilling and goes very well especially in comical scenes.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be honest-I&#039;m a little biased because of Baby Beel&#039;s seiyuu, Sawashiro Miyuki who has done a great job on him and his baby-like noises.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Okay, so I gave this one a high score but of course with reason. The characters inside are not that usual in animes and so is Baby Beel (of course, why would Baby Beel be usual? He&#039;s the cutest thing on both hell and earth.)<br />
<br />
Oga, as said by many as the bastard who never seems to have any sympathy for fellow men, actually shows a slightly (reaaaal slight) tender side towards Baby Beel. You can see him actually developing for a bit in the anime as the story progresses, I would say that it&#039;s because he faces the hardships of raising a baby and being a parent etc. <br />
<br />
Baby Beel is the great demon baby as you probably know already. He exerts great demon-like qualities, yet for some reason can still manage to maintain that innocent image. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I enjoyed this anime quite thoroughly, each episode had me laughing my ass off. If you&#039;re looking for something out of this world (or perhaps under instead) and something to laugh at as well, I&#039;d highly recommend this anime.

    I give this serise a 6, which may come as a suprise to others, yet carefull though has gone into this...<br />
<br />
When the manga came out, I though it sounded promising and in all honesty, it came off to a good start; it was entertaining and the plot is actually fairly brilliant.<br />
Unfortuantley, it slowed down. I gave up a while back, hoping to start reading when it became eventful.<br />
Around a year ago however, I heared an anime was in production; so I dropped the manga in order to fully enjoy this serise in motion picture and erase predictability; at a faster pace, this wasn&#039;t the case.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36089">
        above is my decliration informing people that I did really want to enjoy this series and have invested time into it over the past few years...<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;ll get back on topic...<br />
The problem with this serise is it&#039;s slow pace and characters...<br />
<br />
Story...<br />
<br />
A delinquant youth must raise the infant demon lord, who thrives on conflict, into becoming a fearsome leader who will dominate the world.<br />
The comdey comes into place as this teenager has no choice but to furfil his duty, dispite the fact that he wants no part bringing about world distruction and is far from ready to be a dad.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s wrong with the story is there&#039;s way to much &#039;humor&#039; and not enough focus on the enitial plot.<br />
Comedy or not, the &#039;humor&#039;, which mainly consists of; comical violence, mediocre villians getting beaten up and the babies tantrums, quickly becomes repetitive when you concider how much potential the series actually has.<br />
<br />
Another major flaw is the fact that the manga is still so young, yet it seems production want this to be one of those serises that runs indefinatley, meaning it&#039;s pace won&#039;t speed up and chances are, fillers may be incorporated.<br />
<br />
Characters...<br />
<br />
My personal problem with this serise is the cast of characters.<br />
<br />
Oga is a teenage boy who seems pleasant enough, however, alledgedly, he&#039;s scary, an established delinquant feared by all. We are suppose to simply accept that nobody can beat him - every guy fears him, thoses who don&#039;t are overconfident thugs, some of whom are also established and unbeaten, still, somehow, they all prove no match for him. <br />
There seem to be little quirks to his character apart from the fact that he doesn&#039;t really want any part in what is going on, minus the scenarios, the writer hasn&#039;t really given him a great deal of attention.<br />
<br />
The other characters consist of; a pretty icequeen and a pretty tsundere (cliche of shounen&#039;s today - grumpy girls supressing their feelings); these are the two &#039;love interests&#039;. <br />
There is a fairly interesting passive friend/sidekick who represents the &#039;normal person&#039;, aswell as a submissive supernatural aid, lagging in the attention department in comparrason.<br />
Finally, the baby, simply a baby.<br />
<br />
<br />
I check out the manga now and then, hopefull, something will occur to enspire me to get back into the serise and re-consider this review, yet after two years and 12 episodes, this serise is, unfortunately, dropped. :(

    Plot/Story: 10/10 I just want to start off by saying that this anime is SO fucking funny. You&#039;ll be laughing in the first five minutes. Unless you know......you don&#039;t have a sense of humor. Super original and unique plot. You got this yakuza looking guy looking after a baby. I mostly watched this just for the comedy. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Art: 8/10 Very good art. Not too shabby.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Sound: 9/10 Nice voices. The baby&#039;s voice is adorable.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Characters: 9/10 Super likable characters. Most of them are so funny. Decent character development. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Overall: 8/10 If you like to laugh. Watch this anime. If you&#039;re one of those people who THINK they

    Beelzebub... I was eager to try it at first, found the first episode cute and from then on I found it to be progressively tedious and under-entertaining.<br />
<br />
Story - Skipping the summary, we have a continuous series of who&#039;s tougher than who without any kind of emotional investment or deeply convincing romance. Instead we have low grade manufactured comedy that can&#039;t even crack my lips into a smile if it were as inflexible as water. It has not and I do not expect it to ever give me a laugh where I cradle my gut in my arms in joyous pain.<br />
<br />
There is nothing here of value

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45007">
        here. Nothing... The distinct level gap between the story that actually tries and anime like these are unfathomable unless personally experienced over a period of many years of watching different types of anime.<br />
<br />
Art - Art... I don&#039;t remember any art. You call this art? Character designs don&#039;t really do it for me, not once have I ever stopped to wipe my drool to appreciate it&#039;s animation.<br />
<br />
Sound - Nothing in the sound track, the voices are not memorable.<br />
<br />
Character - They&#039;re all just archetypes, characters we&#039;ve seen done so much better in other animes.  I don&#039;t give a crap if any of them died, honestly, my tissues are doomed to collect dust in the corner of my desk.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - balls, tits, penis, that is all.<br />
<br />
Overall - Unless you enjoy wasting your time because you can&#039;t realize that there are animes that can offer more in less time, by all means watch this...<br />
<br />
This review was not helpful for your ass. Go ahead, screw me like this anime did.<br />

    Raising a baby isn&#039;t as easy as some people might make it seem, especially if the child is the son of the Demon King. His urination has the power to flood the entire country of Japan, oh and make sure to stay within 15 meters of the baby otherwise you will suffer an electrical shock that will instantly electrocute the life out of you.<br />
<br />
Beelzebub is a 60 episode anime series following the high school delinquent protagonist, Oga Tatsumi, whom one day sees a big guy floating down the river, split in half, and is thus given the responsibility of raising the demon baby, Baby Beel.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108259">
        A pretty crazy way to introduce the anime right? Well that&#039;s just the beginning. Accompanied by the demon maid, Hilda, and the dimensional transporter, Alaindelon, Baby Beel has been sent to the human world to destroy humanity. But in order to do so,he  must find a strong human who cares nothing of his fellow man to be his parent and raise him to destroy the human race.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
I loved the story in beelzebub it was something unique and appealing to me right from the start and most importantly, lasted until the end. The anime carries an underlining plot throughout, but most of the episodes are really random and in aspect have really nothing to do with the story whatsoever. But, the comedy and the randomness of each episode was something I loved and made me keep watching. Despite many of these random episodes, the anime does come back to the story and later on the story even becomes a little more complex with new characters and obstacles coming into the picture. The ending did leave me a bit unsatisfied though for I thought we didn&#039;t see everything there was to see in which case some of the random episodes did get in the way.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art was something I felt that really made the anime series enjoyable to watch. The character designs were done really nicely and consistently and it followed the vibe of the anime perfectly. For example, in comical parts of the show the expressions of the characters would fit the part perfectly making it much more funnier.  <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters in this show is what really makes the anime great. Oga is just this badass first year student who beats the crap out of anyone who messes with him all while doing so with the lovable cute demon baby on his back. We have our typical anime best friend to the main character who is a creepy pervert who has gotten into some of the most hilarious situations making me laugh countless times. Even the supporting characters like other delinquents and Oga&#039;s family were great. As you can tell by now this isn&#039;t really the anime to be taken seriously so character development isn&#039;t really a big concern in the anime. But you do see Oga get along and bond and become like a parent to Baby Beel and as far as character development goes that&#039;s pretty much it. But because of all the random episodes there isn&#039;t a need for that at all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
If you couldn&#039;t already tell, I loved Beelzebub. It made me laugh a ton and I just wanted to continue watching the random adventures of Oga and Baby Beel and the rest of their friends forever. If you&#039;re looking for an anime series that&#039;ll make you laugh and is really enjoyable to watch then I recommend Beelzebub. Give it a chance, you won&#039;t regret it.<br />

    This is a purely enjoyment show full of violence and naked baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a story of a delinquent high school student who ended up having to raise a baby due to unexpected occurances, but this isn&#039;t just any baby, it&#039;s the Demon King.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is what you&#039;ll hear at the beginning of each episode. It is a constant reminder of what the show is about... as if we&#039;d forget. The show is pretty random throughout, but the show does carry an underlying plot, so not everything is random. And by random, I mean each episode has some kind of different aspect that needs to be learned

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39549">
        in order to raise a Demon King. Anyway, when the baby isn&#039;t being focused on, the story mainly involves a lot of violence and sometimes... comedy. Mind you, I haven&#039;t found myself laughing very much.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty good, however, a constantly naked baby, isn&#039;t really my thing. The art style changes from time to time to show suspense and anger, but overall the art was consistent and detailed. The backgrounds were more detailed than most anime shows I&#039;ve seen, so that was refreshing. However, the artists reused some scenes a few times which really didn&#039;t sit well with me. But overall, the art was good.<br />
<br />
Same for the sound, the sound wasn&#039;t fantastic or genre-defining, but there wasn&#039;t anything too annoying, other than the constant yelling and screaming.<br />
<br />
There really hasn&#039;t been much character development yet. Everything seems a bit bland and when a character can get depth, the show goes back to attempt some comedy rather than giving a serious moment of character development. This show so far... hasn&#039;t been all that interesting to me, but I am still watching it and hoping that a little romance will develop.. but it seems that hell will have to freeze over before anything serious is introduced. (Sorry for the very bad pun, and no I&#039;m not proud of that sentence.).<br />
<br />
Like I wrote before, this is mainly a show about mindless enjoyment, which is something that is needed every once in a while.<br />

    To put it simply Beelzebub is a show that has overstayed it&#039;s welcome. The first several episodes are enjoyable, exciting and funny, which is why I watched this show until now. <br />
<br />
Sometimes shows should be given some time off to keep us interested at times, I felt that way towards Bleach and now with this one. It&#039;s just become way too predictable. The gags aren&#039;t funny anymore, the animation hasn&#039;t improved one bit, in fact, I think it&#039;s worse! What&#039;s going on with this show? Just feels so empty now. I&#039;ve decided to drop this, which is a shame, since it had some potential. <br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48923">
        story while it keeps progressing, just doesn&#039;t seem as exciting as it used to be. Too predictable as I said. The characters have become so damn annoying and boring I find myself skipping scenes. The music is still crap (never liked it in the first place.)...and my enjoyment well...not there anymore! <br />
<br />
Would I recommend it...hmm I&#039;d say watch the first few episodes to decide that and then drop it once it gets past the whole battle for the most powerful because after that there isn&#039;t much to be excited about.

    I&#039;d like to start off by clearing one thing up.<br />
<br />
I like Beelzebub.<br />
<br />
I like Oga, the unbeatable 16 year old delinquent with his ass-pull power ups, and I absolutely adore Baby Be&#039;el, who - for a baby whose only forms of communications seem to be the phrase &#039;Dabuh&#039; and the victory sign - is one hellishly insightful character. I like watching Oga destroy everyone that happens to march in his way in sadisticly inventive ways. I really like the visceral beauty that is Beelzebub, and giving it a 4 out of 10 must seem extremely outlandish after such statements.<br />
<br />
The thing is, what makes Beelzebub work for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94313">
        me is how bad-ass Oga is. While being perfectly capable of goofing around from time to time, when shit hits the fan, you can expect him to throw all that aside and fluidly assume the role of the ungodly avenger. Fists connect with tangible cracks of impact and bruised enemies, as well as allies, slam into walls with shattering force. Demonic energies are tapped into and buildings crumble down. I&#039;ve read the manga as far as it has been published, and in it, Oga is just that: a demonic harbringer of violence. <br />
<br />
However. This has not been the case in the anime.<br />
<br />
Let us throw all that out the window. Out with the dark, primitive vibe of the fight. Enter pretty, vibrant colors and horribly retarded faces. Let&#039;s get rid off the violent energies ripping the air and replace them with vividly violet sparks. Let&#039;s cut down on the emphasis on short, brutal hand-to-hand combat and slap in some slap-stick humor. The gruntings will get across the physical struggle well enough, surely.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Beelzebub lost its focus when the animators decided to center the show around some of the incredibly hilarious faces Oga pulls off in the lulls between battles. I&#039;ve watched the anime until the end of the first arc, and that was only because I was hoping that the transition towards the harder fights would breathe some new tension into the stupidly over-exaggerated comedy. I was to be denied even this, and proceeded to drop the show without a backwards glance. Beelzebub needs its comic relief, for sure, and it is brilliantly funny, just as surely, but not in these mental quantities that ultimately shrug the novelty out of the jokes and make them annoying at best. Who knows, maybe the show picks up in seriousness later on, but I have no motivation to see if this is the case. I doubt it, anyway. <br />
<br />
I would be interested to see, though, if I would have enjoyed this anime if I hadn&#039;t read the manga first. I enjoy a brains-on-vacation comedy as much as the next guy, if not more so, and this anime does deliver that. From the stupid faces to some of the awkwardly weird scenes, manga-Beelzebub&#039;s crooked twin brother throws a bunch of humoristic punches straight at the viewers ribs that will surely have them hurting from laughter. Although I have to say I grew weary of the jokes by the time the credits of episode 4 were rolling. The following episodes were gratingly painful to bear as a result, but I do have some pretty heavy bias influencing my view on the characters and how they should act.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, there&#039;s not that much to say. Oga and Be&#039;el easily steal the gig for me, with Hildagarde the demon nurse-maid providing some entertaining backdrop, and the rest of the characters fit along snugly with their various, though pretty one-dimensional, gimmicks. Kanzaki is probably the only other character that has actually grown on me, but the predictability of all the characters in the various scenarios of the plot does somehow add to the skewed humor of the series. Plot-wise, Beelzebub is a typical shounen publication, running on the general theme of: bad guy! Smash! For me, the lay-out of the fights makes up for this well enough, and hey, we all know what we&#039;re getting into with these kinds of series. The villains are interesting, with suitably varying powers and bra-sizes (I kid, I kid - though some fan service is present) to keep the battles different.<br />
<br />
To conclude in as brief a manner as possible, as this went on a little longer than I had originally intended, I highly recommend Beelzebub as a series. If you&#039;re looking for some serious bad-ass feels and bodies slamming into walls admist diabolic grins, turn over to the manga. Then again, if a care-free dicking around is more to your liking, I guess you should give the anime a go. Personally, though, if I see that bloody old-Batman-movie-transition-esque fist one more time, I&#039;m slapping someone over the head, hard.

    Beelzebub is a great Anime in every category. Each and every episode will make you laugh your ass off. Actually, I randomly watched an episode from this anime and straight up fall in love with it.<br />
<br />
Story:       10/10<br />
-Story is not completely original but overall it seems as though (a naked baby hanging on the back of a teenage delinquent).<br />
- The baby is absolutely NAKED. (You can see his private parts).<br />
-Transportation is quite amazing done by Batim do Emuna Alaindelon. He is a dimensional transfer demon who split him-self up and can transfer anyone who enters within him to the demon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49735">
        world and the human world back and forth. (Usually he has a weird relationship with Takayauki Furuichi). (Forbidden Love).<br />
-There are many kids of the &quot;Demon Lord&quot; (who has a mind of a teenager) and has more than just one kid that Oga carries. And he has his own battalion called the 34th Pillar Squad (they are quite strong). <br />
-Demon servants and alien like creatures in the demon world. <br />
-Women with big boobs and so on. <br />
-Some funny phrases.<br />
<br />
Art:    9/10<br />
-Some aspects of the art I just don’t like but overall it is great. <br />
<br />
Sound:   10/10<br />
-I didn’t find any glitches in the sound and overall everything I have heard is good. Well a more serious/demonic type of music will be well suited for the scenes which contain violent fights. But that is just my opinion. <br />
<br />
Character:   10/10<br />
-Each one of the character contributes a lot to the Anime and keep it interesting. (NO OBJECTIONS &quot;said by Kanzaki&quot;)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:     10/10<br />
-Well, as I have said before each and every episode will make you laugh like a monkey who just found his precious banana. The reaction of the other character upon other characters is the thing that will make you laugh and enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall:        10/10<br />
-I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for an Anime that is funny unlike other animes with a little twist to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Beelzebub means “Lord of the Flies.”  Plus you might not understand some of my phrases that are in parentheses until you watch the Anime. Right now I have seen at least 45 episodes. <br />

    Beelzebub, a story about a ruthless defiant who doesn´t care about his fellow man at all, paired with the baby of the demon king. <br />
<br />
At first i was skeptical about it, but still gave it a try due to the ratings that the manga had. And if i may say so, i wasn&#039;t let down the least. <br />
<br />
The mixture of action, comedy, supernatural and maybe a little drop of romance makes up a delicious meal. <br />
<br />
The story begins with Oga being chosen as the parent of the demon king&#039;s son, Beelzebub IV. Oga who sees Beel-bo as nothing more than a nuisance tries to get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34595">
        rid of him and in the process beats up some of the strongest delinquents in the school that he is attending, Ishiyama. Although it might not look like it at sometimes, the bond between Oga and Beel-bo is growing and getting stronger. As seen when Oga refuses to give Beel-bo to a group of robbers when they say that they are just going to use him.<br />
<br />
The Art and Sound go well together and the seiyuu&#039;s were perfectly chosen.<br />
As for the art itself, it is what i&#039;d call your average style. something that we have all seen once or more. <br />
<br />
And then we arrive at the characters, alot of typical characters but some with a little twist to them. The real surprise is the main character Oga, he doesn&#039;t look like your average shounen &quot;i need to protect&quot; character. Oga looks evil in any situation even if he tries to be nice. but that is just physically, Oga is portrayed as ruthless but as said many times he is not the ruthless defiant who doesn&#039;t care about his fellow man. In times it is shown that he helps others even if it might mean trouble for him. As seen when he kicked a police officer in his nuts and threw him into the garbage can to prevent Kunieda Aoi from slapping him. <br />
<br />
A 10, yes i gave a 10 for enjoyment. Why? Since it never ceases to make me laugh and look epic at the same time. Whenever it is out on Sunday morning (for me) i usually watch it even before One Piece.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8, because the story is not really that deep yet, so the first 7 episodes are given an 8. I cannot know what happens yet since i don&#039;t read the manga but i&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;ll only get better. <br />
<br />
I hope you guys and girls will give Beelzebub a try now, and when you do i can assure you that you will like it. <br />

    This anime started out great. It has a lot of comedy that works well. In fact it was the comedy that really drove it for me. There is a story of sort, but the storyline is the weakest element in this series. The idea is great, but all in all it&#039;s a fair delivery at best.<br />
<br />
The main character is an incredibly strong delinquent. The connection he forms with Beel is pretty solid, and their relationship is key to the story. The supporting characters are all delinquents as well, and though they have a lot of humor they are all lacking. The fight scenes build up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84727">
        to be a little disappointing, and a lot of great ideas just fall short. By no means is this a bad series, it&#039;s just missing something. Though I loved the comedy at first, it all became a little monotonous. <br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t recommend skipping this series because it does have it&#039;s high moments. I just wouldn&#039;t set your expectations too high. Some will love the comedy all the way through and others will feel as I did. I loved the premise but was disappointed in the execution. Keep this on the back burner, but no rush to watch.

    Now, LET&#039;S BEGIN! Beelzebub huh? Ever since I saw it in the upcoming spring anime, It never really caught my eye. That is until it came out.<br />
<br />
The first episode will leave you in tears. I&#039;m serious! You&#039;ll be laughing so hard that you will begin to cry! The whole concept is hilarious! Definitely watch this anime if your looking for a good laugh!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Well as funny as the show is, the story is kind of weird. Really not something that I would have expect when I saw the anime at first. It&#039;s basically about this normal teenage kid who under certain circumstances is raising a, to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34750">
        be, demon lord. Of course, this is anime so the sense of reality is already gone. But that doesn&#039;t prevent this story from being funny!<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Great art composition. But almost all new animes have great art composition. Fluent movement, and at times really detailed. There are parts when the animation goes really dark, but that&#039;s mostly for the atmosphere they are trying to create.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Awesome! All their voice acting is great, even Baby Beel. I didn&#039;t know how they were going to dub a babies voice, but they found a way! The intro is...not bad, I personally like that it&#039;s not a pop or hiphop kind of opening but a rock theme. It also fits very well with the show, fun and upbeat!<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
All the characters are awesome! Unique, funny and a riot to watch.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I enjoyed this show and will continue to enjoy watching it as new episodes come out.<br />
<br />
I hoped you enjoyed reading my review! :)

    &quot;Let me tell you something good—Beel won’t destroy the human world, do you know why? It’s because I’m his parent, I won’t ever let him do something this stupid.&quot; - Tatsumi Oga<br />
<br />
I shall go straight into this, hopefully it&#039;s an alright review.<br />
<br />
Story: There are many stories about devils/Satan and such, but this one is a bit different. Satan sends his baby to Earth to pick a strong person who then will raise him to be able to destroy Humans. He then picks Oga Tatsumi, a delinquent, and faces many tough challenges of raising Beel. <br />
<br />
Art: The art of Beelzebub was nice. Good colors, backgrounds, details,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180290">
        and the faces the characters will sometimes make are priceless. I don&#039;t really have any negatives on the art.<br />
<br />
Sound:The first opening was very catchy, and I really enjoyed it. The voice actors for each character, especially Beelzebub, were very enjoyable and were perfect for them. The voices sounded right for each character.<br />
<br />
Character: Each of the characters of this show are different, unique, and very funny. Not much to say.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: To be honest, when I started it I wasn&#039;t expecting it to be so hilarious or a favorite of mine. I was took by surprise by how funny it was, you will be crying from laughter every episode. The only problem I had with the series really, was how rushed the ending was. The main focus of the last episode should have been Beel going back to Hell, but Satan sends him back. That happened, but in literally the last 5 minutes. It felt very rushed. <br />
<br />
Overall: It was a really enjoyable series, with many laughs. I would re-watch many times in the future, and would recommend to many people.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you find any flaws you want to point out in this, please message/comment it to me. It would be greatly appreciated. <br />

    Hello everyone, welcome to my beelzebub anime review...*seethe*... if any of you remember my manga review then you&#039;d think I&#039;d br praising this too right? WRONG!! I CAN&#039;T STAND THIS ANIME ADAPTATION, I SWEAR BEELZEBUB&#039;S GOT THE WORST LUCK IN THE WORLD TO GET THIS PILE OF GARBAGE AS A ANIME ADAPTION!! well, I&#039;m going to beging being a bit more mature reviewer here and explain to you why I despise this  piec of sh- anime, so much, while I have nothing but love for the manga.<br />
<br />
Story: Its pretty much the same, which really should make me hate it less, but its exactly this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56183">
        reason why I hate it. It comes off the same, but they twist and turn so many things that made it awesome in the orignal. for example, Oga was supposed to blow ishyama into rubble after his fight with you know who, but instead it gets disoriented with a retarded punch mark. how... is that possible? I know beelzebub is batshit insane but thats just dumb! not to mention how they pretend like every deleinquent knows DBZ style ki attacks, when its really just the wind force from their blows. you don&#039;t even want to get me started on the fillers, the magical girl one was the most ridiculous. I really lost my shit during  the rooftop battle arc, where stuff begins to happen that dosn&#039;t even exist in the manga, and they dare go back to the original plot. I just dropped it right then and there. basicly its the &quot;same&quot; but with many retarded twists and turns, its stupid for even beelzebub.<br />
<br />
Art: it sucks. Just flat out sucks. I always thought fairy tail&#039;s anime had crappy animation, but beelzebub&#039;s anime made fairy tail look like BONES did the animation in my eyes! The designs into the anime range from semi ok to really annoying(why does hilda have elevator shoes?) the movements acctually seem to dull out the jokes rather than improve on them and the fight scenes... my god the fight scenes. the only one I liked was the last one against the THKH, and even that was just barely, the fights before hand were just pathetic only aoi&#039;s managing to entertain. The fights afterwards try to give everyone DBZ like ki attacks when its supposed to be OGA who can only do that, and he scarely does it! the rooftop fight with the three generals, which was my favorite supernatural fight in the manga, got completely butchered due to the pisspoor movements and hits not even seeming to connect. I&#039;ve seen students in a animation class do better than these clowns!<br />
<br />
sound: I barely acknowledged the sound track. nothing really struck me as memerable and only did its job to keep me awake while watching some of these episodes. I only liked the first OP and ED pair, the 3 end had pretty animation better than the damn show and was a nice song in general while op 3 was meh is, all the other themes were either mediocre, or can burn in hell for all I care.<br />
<br />
Characters: all the characters I&#039;ve come to love so much in the manga, the anime just pulled out the darkest, most cliche&#039; parts about them and milked them for all its worth. I know oga&#039;s a dumbass but in the anime he completely looses whatever coolness he had in the manga. There he was dense but also had a decent understanding about how delinqents roll and knew what action was right, here he seems just as cliche as any other shonen hero, Furichi&#039;s pervness gets to the point of disturbance, Hilda&#039;s barely there, increasing my lack of intrest in her character, Alendelon is much more gayer than the manga, Lamia&#039;s voice makes my ears bleed, Beelzebub&#039;s shocks become more annoying than funny, Kanzaki and Himekawa...well I didn&#039;t care that much for them in the manga anyway... but worst of all, AOI. my favorite female character there, her &quot;cute&quot; onesided love for oga gets WAAAAAY overplayed, to the point where I understood WHY her haters disliked her, plus she isn&#039;t nearly as badass as in the manga, need I bring up the fact that she never flipped Mikki in the rooftop fight? Tojo is the only one they didn&#039;t ruin fortunatly (seeing how he&#039;s allready dumber than oga its kinda hard to make him dumber) and shizuka&#039;s crush is more played out a bit, seeing how it never got that way in the manga but oh well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Do I seriously need to fill this out? <br />
<br />
Overall: The manga was, and still is, shittons better. Maybe if sunrise did this and they didn&#039;t start when it was only on chapter 90!! it could have played out alot better,  but for now, I curse this anime to burn in the deeptest pits of hell, and I gleefully await when this trash ends in april and stops ruining my beloved manga.

    Okay, there comes a time when you might begin to take animes too seriously. You see yourself overthinking events that occur or you take characters words seriously and begin to reflect on them. This eventually becomes REALLY tiring later on.I took Beelzebub as a breadth of fresh air from all this seriousness and I found meself VERY entertaining and relaxing anime.<br />
You must have read the synopsis, so you can guess what its about. The execution however is amazing!!! Surprisingly, this anime develops a really nice plot as the show progresses and there are tons of funny moments to keep you smiling throughout half the show.<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209062">

    I really love how this manga and anime is turning out. <br />
You think it might be boring because it is just your average high school delinquent who goes around beating people up to be the best, but can you imagine that kind of generic storyline is definitely awesome ! <br />
It is that kind of humorous trait in this manga that makes it special. <br />
I would also be very much surprised if you did not even find one joke or gag humorous or funny. Usually making light humour in a serious life or death situation is done badly, like bleach. But Beelzebub does it really great,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192674">
        so much so it is natural like One Piece. In the end read it for the awesome fights!<br />
<br />
I hope can Get another season or continuing  ! :&#039;)

    The story follows Tatsumi Oga, a first year student at a school for juvenile delinquents called Ishiyama High. The story starts with Oga telling his best friend, Takayuki Furuichi, the strange story of how he found a baby. One day while doing &#039;laundry&#039; by the river, Oga saw a man floating downstream. Oga pulled him to shore but the man split in half, revealing a baby boy inside. This baby turned out to be the son of the great demon king, and Oga has been chosen as the one to raise him, along with the baby&#039;s maid, Hilda. The manga follows Oga&#039;s life as he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150871">
        tries to raise the child while enrolled at Ishiyama High.<br />
<br />
In the early chapters, he attempts to &#039;pass on&#039; Beel to other students at Ishiyama, thinking that if he can find someone stronger and more evil than himself, the baby will attach himself to that person instead. He decides to try to pass the baby on to the Touhoushinki, Ishiyama High&#039;s strongest four students. Oga meets and fights Hajime Kanzaki, the first member of the Touhoushinki and the one who is closest to dominating the school; however, Oga defeats Kanzaki, which causes Beel to find him even more appealing.<br />
<br />
Later, Oga discovers a peculiar symbol etched on the back of his right hand. Hilda explains that it is the fly king&#039;s seal, more commonly known as the Zebub spell, and serves as the family crest of the royal family. The appearance of the seal means that he has officially made a contract with Beel. She also explains that the more evil the bearer of the seal is, the more complex the design of the seal will become. Oga attempts to prevent the seal from growing by avoiding fights with other students, but gives up when Himekawa, the second member of the Touhoushinki, captures Hilda and Furuichi. Oga infiltrates Himekawa&#039;s base to rescue them and defeats him by using the Zebub blast for the first time. The consequences of using the seal&#039;s power cause the crest to stretch across his arm. Hilda comments after looking at the crest that the amount of energy it used would have driven a normal human mad.<br />
<br />
While visiting the park, Oga meets a girl named Aoi and her brother, Kouta. Oga asks her immediately to go out with him, which causes a misunderstanding that stays within Aoi&#039;s heart. Oga tells Beel to fight Kouta, possibly as a joke, but Kouta accepts the challenge and easily pushes Beel off a bench. This event sparks a rivalry between the two babies. It is later revealed that Aoi, who was in disguise the whole time, is in fact Aoi Kunieda, the leader of the Red Tails and another member of the Touhoushinki.<br />
<br />
Aoi, who was away from school during the earlier events of the manga, has returned to Ishiyama High to defeat Oga in order to prevent him from causing any more trouble within the school. When they encounter each other in battle, she realizes that she has already met Oga in the park, but he doesn&#039;t recognize her. After he dodges her attacks twice, he notices Beel&#039;s interest in Aoi and asks her to become Beel&#039;s mother. Although he means for her to replace him as a parent, his request causes another misunderstanding similar to the one in the park. The fight is postponed, and Hilda soon arrives to give Beel his milk. The MK5 make their debut in the story, only to be defeated in a five panel pattern which appears again later in the story. After the fight, Beel senses something which turns out to be the last of the Toushinki, Toujou. Oga, however, does not notice.<br />
<br />
Aoi sees Oga and Hilda&#039;s fight with the MK5, and believes the rumors that they are husband and wife. She is challenged by Hilda to a fight so she can test her ability, but the fight ends quickly with Hilda deciding that Aoi isn&#039;t on the same level as Oga. At the same time, Oga is confronted by Chiaki and Nene. Two female students tell Aoi that Oga injured the two of them, which later turns out to be MK5.<br />
<br />
Aoi fights Oga to avenge her two classmates, while Oga assumes that she wants to accept the role of becoming Beel&#039;s parent. At the same time, Nene wakes up in the infirmary and goes to warn Aoi of MK5&#039;s trap, which turns out to be Miwa&#039;s scheme. MK5, however, prevents anyone from interrupting Aoi and Oga&#039;s fight. Nene is about to get shot, but Natsume appears and fights with MK5 to allow Nene to tell Aoi. She was unfortunately too late, as Aoi seems to have defeated Oga, and she comes just in time for Miwa and Ikari to take over.<br />
<br />
Oga suddenly gets back up and defeats Ikari and Miwa with ease. It is then shown that Furuichi and Hilda have been watching the whole time. Oga, Furuichi, Hilda and baby Beel go to the beach in search of Toujou to hand baby Beel over to him, not knowing that this is a plot set up by Kanzaki and Himekawa, who want Toujou and Oga to crush each other. Aoi goes to the beach as well to warn Oga of Toujou&#039;s strength. Oga and the gang have troubles searching for Toujou and are sent on a wild goose chase. Oga decides to write a letter of challenge to Toujou and have Aoi pass it to him. Aoi attempts to tear it up, but one of Toujou&#039;s henchmen finds it. They are supposed to meet between the two rocks at 5 PM. Oga is confronted by the MK5 once again, but quickly defeats them and arrives late. Toujou has left after crushing several motorcycle gangs, which inspires Oga to find Toujou. Later, baby Beel starts feeling sick and it appears that he&#039;s come down with a cold. However, Oga&#039;s tattoo mysteriously vanishes, and later that night Beel disappears. Hilda kicks Oga out of the house and leaves to find help in the demon world. Oga goes off to find Beel, but runs into Tojou, who, as it turns out, has Beel on his back. After a scuffle, Toujou comes out as the victor, and asks Oga to challenge him again sometime. Once Oga gets home, he is in a surprise to find Hilda there waiting for him, with a strange demon doctor known as Dr. Furucas, and his assistant, Lamia. Furucas reveals that the cold is actually Beel&#039;s way of coping with a rise of his power, by keeping the energy within himself, and that he cut off the link between him and Oga to protect him. Lamia then injects Oga with a drug that allows him to reestablish the connection with Beel. Oga then goes to confront Tojou with the aid of the three other Tohoshinki. Once he makes it to Toujou, Beel returns to normal and goes back to Oga. Toujou and Oga then have one final duel in which Oga is victorious, but baby Beel&#039;s influx of power causes him to destroy Ishiyama.<br />
<br />
Due to their school being destroyed, the students of Ishiyama can only go to their sister school, Saint Ishiyama. Initially, they are constantly looked down on, but after a volleyball match against the Six Knights, the negative views towards them stop. During the volleyball match, Oga&#039;s demonic power is displayed due to a fight with someone who had a grudge on him, though it is covered up by the Saint Ishiyama president who claimed that it is just a trick. The president turned up to be a demon himself.<br />
<br />
A new teacher soon arrives to replace the one teaching the Ishiyama group, knocking out both Oga and Toujou on the same day before carrying them to the classroom. The teacher, Zenjiro Saotome, later appears when Oga, Hilda and Aoi are attacked by Hecadoth, and puts up a fight against the demon. Later, Naga and Graphel, the other two demons who came to the world in search of Oga, appear before Saotome, but Saotome uses his Spellmaster spell to attack them. After realizing that he is a Spellmaster who is too powerful for them to win against, Naga uses a teleporting jewel to take the three demons back to Demon World. After that Saotome, the spellmaster althogh having Oga refuse he ends up training him.
