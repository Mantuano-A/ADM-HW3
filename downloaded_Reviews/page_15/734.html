    I didn&#039;t expect to like this series so much. The animation is average and of an older anime era, and military/sci-fi anime is always a hit or miss with me. But you can&#039;t NOT love Captain Tylor. As the title says, he&#039;s irresponsible... on of my favorite anime music videos has hime singing &amp;quot;Reponsibility, what&#039;s that?&amp;quot; But he&#039;s also a very happy, easy going or care free individual who thinks life should just be fun. Though he makes enemies within his own fleet due to his idiotic luck, he manages to win the respect and eventually friendship of many of their foes (I&#039;d say he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2852">
        could sweet-talk himself out of any assassination attempt). Somehow this misfit crew becomes the most notable in the war. <br />
<br />
In the same regards as Luffy, you can sympathize with the crew with who they have as a captain... you have to scoff and laugh that anyone like Tylor managed to become captain. And yet through unimaginable luck, gets out of every mishap still smiling. This series is just plain fun to watch. My dad and everyone in my anime club are always happy to sit down and re-watch episodes. The ending was also a great climax and conclusion (especially for a series largely bent on comedy or entertainment). I would recommend the series to anyone. I also don&#039;t mind watching the dub for this series which is rare for me.

    One of the most popular archetypes of pop-culture is that of the accidental genius: the guy who achieves outstanding success with little visible effort or awareness. The most popular example of this as of late is that of Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates films, but it goes back all the way to such classic fables like &amp;quot;The Brave Little Tailor&amp;quot;. Again, the accidental genius finds itself in Irresponsible Captain Taylor, and it&#039;s just as effective and entertaining.<br />
Justy can&#039;t be bothered to look up his middle name Tylor is in many respects the idealic hero. While caring and compassionate, he remains firm in his persuits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5569">
        and rarely suffers any of the moral conflict that plague other protagonists. Whatever emotional issues the rest of the sizable cast might suffer, Tylor stays Tylor through it all, and that alone earns this series major points in my book.<br />
The plotline is farely simple, which is actually something of a disappointment considering this type of story really lends itself to plot intricities (see &amp;quot;Cerebus&amp;quot; graphic novels for an excellent example of such). Still, it remains accessable and entertaining for all viewers. The art isn&#039;t anything special, but by no means bad; simply put, it accomplishes what a series that isn&#039;t aesthetically focused requires. The music is pretty good, what of it there is. <br />
That pretty much covers all the bases. Really, when a show is this good, it&#039;s hard to describe it technically. All I can do is recommend it to anyone who loves a good story (with a great character) and hope you&#039;ll take my word for it.

    There is a time and a place to be irresponsible...the military, is not one of them.<br />
<br />
*MILD SPOILERS AHOY! WATCH IRRESPONSIBLE CAPTAIN TYLOR BEFORE READING THIS. THIS SERIES DESERVES MORE ATTENTION. IT GUD*<br />
<br />
I got nothing for this intro. Like Tylor, I&#039;m just to irresponsible. Did this series even deserve one in the first place? Let`s find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
STORY: 9/10<br />
<br />
So, a &quot;dumbass&quot;, two hardasses, two beautiful identical twins, and a bunch of weirdos join together in a dump of a destroyer, and hilarity ensues, as they wriggle through encounter after encounter with the Raalgon empire. That is half of the premise. The other half is that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233827">
        of a ridiculous rise to power by Tylor, via crazy ass situations that lead him into becoming the captain of a dumping ground of a destroyer, The Soyozake, where his crew is just as outlandish as him, but we`ll get to that in the characters section. This is in the middle of a war between Earth and Raalgon. After some encounters, a medic/Raalgon spy is sent to their ship, Tylor gets captured (and the spy is revealed as such, even though Tylor already knew due to an earlier encounter, but is accepted nonetheless) and starts to bond with the empress before she gets captured along with Tylor who is caught by his own ship, both guys go back to their posts after a big party, a suspenseful encounter to end them all ensues, and after leaving his ship after an old friend dies (in which his friends in both sides attend to in a heart-wrenching scene, especially when Tylor shows up) Tylor and co. eventually come back, knowing that even amidst all the fun they went off to have, the war is still not over. That last part was the ending, and an amazing and crazy one at that. <br />
<br />
It seems impossible that Tylor would get so far, but given who he works with, it makes sense that he ended up where he did. Also, don`t let this series fool you, while it is definitely bombastic and quirky, it is definitely serious at times, to a deceptive level given what came before. The last 4 episodes really take you for a loop, one that would later be rivaled by the likes of Code Geass R2`s final 4 episodes. It puts you through something so sudden and drastic before revealing the curtain that really sells the finale to you in a satisfying and impressive way. I&#039;m not gonna lie, the ending cop-out was glorious and of course, the show ends it by the crew getting ready for more adventures (that we may never get to see).<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 9/10<br />
<br />
As I said before, we have a radical bunch. Tylor is mellow, a bit pervy, and definitely irresponsible. He can be both lucky and either stupid or smart, depending on the situation, and the ending really embodies it when he goes seemingly depressed and absurd. An enigma to be sure. Yuriko Star has a hard time putting up with him, as she is a bit uptight, moreso than anyone on the ship, as she tries to make the captain more responsible, up to her standard. Still, by the end, we can all see that she loves him regardless. Yamamoto originally hated his guts, due to his irresponsibility, as does Mifune and the other asshole (both of whom never really get their comeuppance for trying to sabotage Tylor aside from loads of constant failure and embarrassment),  but grows to like him after his luck lands some nice close calls. Kim is more laid back than most, is a bit rebellious, and oh so gorgeous, but even she has standards about Tylor`s recklessness. Katori is more zen-like, but unfortunately hasn&#039;t a chance to stand out. Shame really.<br />
<br />
Yumi and Emi were originally saved by Tylor after he barged into a hostage situation involving them, Yuriko, and Tylor`s friend, Hanner, as hostages, and as such, become total (pretty) fangirls toward him. They also attempt to get chummy with the crew&#039;s ace pilot, Kojiro, a proud pilot who is laughably petrified of women, and as such, often pushes them away. He also has a beef with the rough-housing, insubordinate, punk marines, such as Andressen, Jason, and Cryburn, who are a total riot, but get the crew into a lot of trouble, almost as much as the captain himself. Kitaguchi is a dunk doctor who really relates to Tylor more than anyone on this ship. As mentioned, there is a medic (an angelically beautiful one) known as Harumi. After some attacks gone wrong (and scenes in which 90% of the crew`s men get super attracted to her), she eventually grows to love Tylor. Yes, this does mean that Tylor has a harem. Lucky bastard. Well, he has been described to have the devil`s luck. <br />
<br />
As for the Raalgons, they are colorful too. Azalyn is a very pretty empress who is a bit soft but acts tough (kinda like a tsundere) but eventually grows to love Tylor after her encounters with him. She even gives him a cute nickname. Dom is the closest person she has, and is definitely a mysterious and alluring leader that takes a particular interest in Tylor after he is tricked by him. Shia Has (another heart-stoppingly attractive woman) is a lot more cold and wary, and unfortunately doesn&#039;t get the screen time that her superiors get. Some of these guys are assholes, like Wang (the scheming prime minister who is in the same boat as Mifune in many ways), but some of them get their just desserts. Too bad this war may never end. Regardless, to keep almost each and every member of such a giant cast as likable as possible is quite a feat since man do I wanna have more fun with these guys. Just try to tell me that you dot wish you could be part of the crew, I dare you!<br />
<br />
ART: 9/10<br />
<br />
This is one of Tatsunoko Production&#039;s best-looking work yet. I adore the shading on the town, and on the ships, and considering that often we`re in space and the town is often at night, we get to see this marvelous shading quite often. Plus, the character models are downright lovely to look at, as well as every female in this series. The space battles aren&#039;t amazing to look at, but are serviceable. I love the use of lighting in the final one though. The OP is also well done in its animation as well. It`s really the character models and shading that sell the art of this show, above anything else, and boy do they ever sell the aesthetic of this show.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7/10<br />
<br />
The OP, &quot;Just Think Of Tomorrow&quot; by Mari Sasaki, is a rather pleasant and catchy track that really works with the mostly upbeat nature of this series. The ED, &quot;Downtown Dance&quot; by Mari Sasaki is also cool to listen to, and makes a great way to chill after whatever hilarity just ensued in the episode you just finished. The OST was done by Kenji Kawai, and some of the tracks are definitely catchy, and a lot of them really blend well with the scenes, even if a few of them feel off in emotional moments. the vocal songs, like the one Tylor sings at the end of episode 24, are a nice touch too.<br />
<br />
The dub, isn&#039;t so great. It&#039;s good that the translations are on point, but the voices often don&#039;t fit, and it just doesn&#039;t work with a lot of these guys, especially Yamamoto and Andressen. This was another pre-Bebop dub, and it shows.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
<br />
As I stated, the colorful cast is definitely a treat to be around, and like with future series with colorful crews, like Gurren Lagann and Blazblue, I&#039;m gonna miss these guys. The humor was chaotic and fun, the characters were great, and the last 4 episodes were great and really strung us along for as ride, especially that ending. It was definitely a crazy ride, but a fun one to be sure given the extremely lovable cast and their endearing misadventures. I&#039;d actually like to see this get a real continuation just to journey with these guys again, to the point where I wish I was part of their crew since I&#039;m sure I&#039;d have a blast hanging out with them.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 8.88/10<br />
<br />
Again, I&#039;m irresponsible, so no wonder I don&#039;t have anything to really say for closing thoughts. Just, watch this series, if you haven&#039;t already. It&#039;s a fun classic for any space military fan. I&#039;ve got nothing else to add, unfortunately. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nah, I&#039;m just kidding. Musekinin Kanchou Tylor is a blast that is out of this world, literally and figuratively. With great music, lovely characters and equally lovely designs, it&#039;s also real pleasant to binge. Not to mention that glorious gauntlet of final episodes and how hilarious the finale was. This is a must watch classic for any space anime fan and 90s fan. With all that said, now I bid you adieu.

    Hey there, you!  Recent university graduate!  Are you looking for a cushy, simple job with great benefits and a generous pension upon your successful retirement?  Are you looking to kick back and enjoy a peaceful, relaxing life of little stress and even less responsibility so you can spend the rest of your days getting paid for goofing off amongst friends?  If you’ve answered yes to any of those questions, then get dressed, get out of bed, and sign up for the United Planets Space Force!  If you can flirt your way through our thorough job interview, then you’re already well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180149">
        on your way to joining the crew of the Soyakaze, a space ship full of rejects and degenerates from across the globe, and Commanded by the decorated yet perpetually Irresponsible Captain, Justy Ueki Tylor!  You’ll get free room and board, at least five different lovely ladies, and the instant respect of your peers!  Oh, and remember, don’t take your position too seriously.  It’s just a war, after all!<br />
<br />
It should go without saying that Irresponsible Captain Tylor is a very old series.  In fact, dating back to 1993, it’s actually the oldest anime I’ve reviewed thus far.  And yet, surprisingly enough, it just might be one of the best looking shows I’ve ever reviewed.  It isn’t just surprising because of the show’s date, but also because of the company that released it, Studio Deen.  I’ve known at least a few people who call Deen their least favorite animation studio, siting shows like Higurashi and the original Fate/Stay Night as their reasons why.  Which is a fair assessment, because those shows were nowhere near visual wonders, but the truth is that I’ve seen just as much good from this company as I’ve seen bad from them.   <br />
<br />
Yes, judging from the visual style, Tylor is incredibly dated.  Despite the fact that it’s a sci-fi show, there is not a single drop of CG in it’s 26 episode run...  At least, not that I could notice.  It carries the classic aesthetic of it’s time, and I haven’t seen any new anime following that aesthetic in at least a decade.  There’s no moe girls, no bishies...  Okay, maybe one or two of the villains...  No, this show looks purely like a product of it’s times, and the fact that only about a fifth of the characters have big eyes should be your first clue to that.  But while the visual style may be dated, the animation itself could easily hold up even in today’s market.  You can tell right from the first episode that Studio Deen had no shortage of money to sink into this series, despite being limited by the technology of the time.  The images on screen aren’t always moving, but when they are, they move fluidly, with such great attention to detail that even the fluttering of somebody’s cape gets the same loving treatment as the ships and characters themselves.  It wasn’t exactly rare for a show in the early nineties to look this good, but it’s always a treat when they do.<br />
<br />
The limited technology of the nineties is also apparent with the show’s soundtrack, a purely instrumental collection full of tracks that don‘t just repeat the same notes over and over, like a lot of the more modern osts that I’ve had the misfortune of listening to.  Throughout the series, Toshiyuki Watanabe goes full orchestra, utilizing every instrument from piano to drum to pipe organ, striking many different moods in the process.  There are very few OSTs that I’ve actually found myself compelled to buy, and this is definitely one of them, although my only real gripe about the actual CD is that it doesn’t include either of the classical music pieces that were played towards the end of the series.  The soundtrack can be found relatively cheap if you buy it used on Amazon, and if you’re looking for a taste of it before committing, I’d recommend testing the waters with Samurai of Space, Strange Love, and the jubilant Forward Tylor!<br />
<br />
When watching the English dub, you’re going to run into three voices that should instantly strike a chord in your heart...  Crispin Freeman, who plays the loose goofball and titular captain Tylor; Rachel Lillis, who plays the by-the-book Lt. Commander Yuriko Star as well as billboard Idol Noriko;  And Lisa Ortiz, who pulls triple duty playing the twin pilot trainees Emi and Yumi as well as the fiery teenage empress of the Raalgonian empire, Azalyn.  Ortiz had some major experience coming into this, having already performed the central role of Deedlit in Record of Lodoss War, but for the other two, this was their first ever attempt at starring roles...  And it’s an attempt they succeeded at beautifully.  Rachel Lillis, who would later be known for several important roles in the Pokemon franchise, brings an air of love, discipline and patience to a character who could have easily been played as yet another tsundere love interest.  Seminal voice actor Crispin Freeman, despite this being really early in his career, shows off his trademarked elasticity all the same.  He plays up the mystery of his character, peppering a light-hearted air-head delivery with a sense of knowing, and in some cases, he even winds up sounding condescending as a result...  And it winds up being the perfect balance when you consider just how little we ever learn about how the character’s mind works.<br />
<br />
There are several other well known actors in minor roles throughout the series, like Dan Green and Ted Lewis, and Professor Oak himself Stan Hart playing the boisterous, alcoholic surgeon who looks about 20 years older than the series claims he is.  For the most part, the acting in this series is subdued and natural, and aside from Tylor himself, the only really over the top performances come from a pugnacious young fighter pilot who’s afraid of women and a couple of large rough and tumble marines.  It’s a very solid dub overall, but even if it wasn’t, I’d still recommend it just based on the fact that it’s an important title in the careers of three legendary voice actors who are still pumping out work to this day.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you enjoy this title will ultimately depend on what it is you’re expecting out of it.  It presents itself as a sci-fi comedy, and if you’re looking for a comedy, you won’t find any problem with this material.  The jokes are constant, mostly character-based, and inventive, rarely ever relying on such cliched devices such as awkward situations, misunderstandings or random slapstick.  I say rarely because that kind of humor does slip into the story now and then, but it’s never present enough to get old.  It’s also really careful with it’s use of romantic comedy tropes, as the harem angle only really comes up in one episode, but it’s played for laughs while something much more original is happening in the background.  To put it bluntly, every girl on the ship makes a pass at Tylor while all the poor guy is trying to do is keep a porn tape from getting erased while desperately trying to keep it a secret from them.  Even the swimsuit contest...  Yes, that happens, and it’s as confusing as it sounds, as there’s no reason any of these characters should need to have swimsuits on the ship in the first place...  Plays the part of a larger and more important plot going on in that episode, and winds up serving as character development.<br />
<br />
If you’re watching it with the expectation of it being a sci-fi title, however, you may come away from this series a little disappointed.  I’m not going to say there’s nothing sci-fi about Tylor, because it IS a show about the crew of a spaceship getting caught up in a galactic inter-species war, but the universe of this series is a very small one...  We barely spend any time on a vaguely defined technologically advanced planet that may or not be earth, and aside from that, the only real settings we spend any time in are the UPSF main station, The Raalgon Empire’s flagship, and the Soyokaze itself.  Extraterrestrial planets occasionally factor into the plot of an episode or two, but they’re never utilized as anything other than plot devices.  The reasons behind the war between humanity and the Raalgon Empire is also very vaguely explained...  It’s stated that humanity may or may not have killed the former Raalgon emperor, but this plot point is never explored.  How did he die?  Why do they think it was us?  What actually happened?  Azalyn’s emotional response to this is portrayed with a great deal of subtlety and maturity, but it’s kind of an important plot point to just drop cold after episode 1.<br />
<br />
Ironically, Irresponsible Captain Tylor’s greatest strength is also it’s greatest weakness, and that would be Tylor himself.  On the one hand, he’s every bit a cult of personality...  He comes into a ship full of the aforementioned rejects and degenerates because the higher-ups want him to screw up in the most contained environment possible, so they can find an excuse to fire him without having to suffer any major losses in the process.  And what better place to put him than a ship where no captain has ever lasted more than three days?  But this winds up backfiring hard as his loosey goosey attitude winds up fitting in perfectly well with this wretched hive of scum and idiocy.  As one of his first orders of business, he orders the crew to, and I quote, ‘do whatever you want!’  This does result in quite a bit of anarchy and some justified outrage from the few cool heads on board, but amazingly enough, everybody quickly settles back into routine, with the only major change being their attitudes towards one another.  It’s through stunts like this that he proves that as long as there are no outright villains involved, a community really can support itself without strict rules and regulations.  There are a lot of moments in the series like that...  Tylor bumbles his way through a situation, and things just happen to turn out for the better, and it’s never really clear whether he’s accomplishing these feats by accident or design.<br />
<br />
No, scratch that...  It isn’t just never made clear, it’s the main hook of the series.  The viewer is meant to determine for themselves whether Tylor is a careless idiot who happens to possess the best luck in the galaxy, or if he’s actually a genius who’s just pretending to be stupid in order to enforce his decisions more smoothly.  One of the hallmarks of good writing is the ability to inspire debate and discussion amongst fans and haters alike, and this series is very good at that.  The debate over the method to Tylor’s madness may not be as deep or profound as the political, moral, social or even philosophical discussions certain other shows inspire, but the fact that both sides can make equally valid arguments is proof that it’s still in the same ballpark, so for that alone, Tylor is well written enough to hold it’s own under the scrutiny of even the harshest critics.<br />
<br />
The main problem I had with this...  Which is the show’s biggest weakness, at least in my opinion...  Is that while both answers are equally valid, neither answer really paints the series in a positive light.  First of all, if Tylor is really an idiot who just happens to have the greatest luck known to man, then the circumstances leading to all of his victories are some of the most badly written, contrived coincidences I’ve ever seen.  There are several moments throughout the show where the events unfolding, if we’re to view them as random, would have certainly allowed the captain and his crew to perish had they not occurred.  I’ve called other shows stupid for far less than this, and those are shows that pulled miraculous occurrences out of their asses ONCE to save the lives of it’s characters.  The reason Tylor gets away with it is ultimately because of the mystery involved.<br />
<br />
But there’s also the possibility that Tylor’s just clever like a fox, right?  Well, frankly, that’s even worse.  To explain this, let’s take a look at the first few episodes of Trigun.  For a long stretch in that series, Vash the Stampede would act like a moron, insert himself into dire situations, and find ways to orchestrate solutions to these problems that don’t result in any lives lost without ever overtly taking the credit for any of it.  He does this to save as many lives as possible without attracting attention, due to the weight that his name and reputation carry.   Now imagine how these episodes would make you feel if his exploits resulted in hundreds of deaths, and he just smugly shrugged them all off as unfortunate accidents.  It isn’t as funny now, is it?  <br />
<br />
Now imagine that he doesn’t trust even his closest friends and allies enough to let them know about his opinions or desires, and instead just manipulates them for his own selfish purposes without showing any signs of remorse or compromise.  Imagine he’s been trusted with accomplishing something that every single one of his allies wants, and only he doesn’t.  Imagine if he goes along with the plan for most of the way, then bales on it and intentionally side tracks it so that he can have his way without appearing as selfish and stubborn as he really is.  Vash would never do this, which is why you can’t classify him as a sociopath.  But if we’re to believe that Tylor knows damn well what he’s doing at all times throughout the series, then...  Well, he did exactly that on at least one occasion.  That explanation makes him look like a sociopathic asshole, and a very difficult one to redeem at that.  That kind of person should under no circumstances be allowed to lead anybody, let alone the crew of a military vessel.<br />
<br />
The saving grace of the series that makes up for these problems almost completely is the ambiguity of it all.  This series is extremely careful to not sway to either side of the fence in terms of what Tylor’s motivation and method really is, which will keep most viewers so busy guessing that they’ll never even bother to analyze just how troubling either answer is.  Or hell, maybe it’s a mix of both answers!  There’s one episode taking place inside of Tylor’s mind...  Yes, that happens, but I won’t spoil it by telling you why or how...  And in one scene, you hear two distinct thoughts in his head.  One of them says the key to a long military career is to run away, and the other one says that it’s easier to play the fool than to be tortured.  Not only do these two thoughts perfectly represent both sides of the argument, but they still seem like two thoughts that could just as easily exist in the same mind.  You’ve gotta give Tylor this...  An anime’s ability to recognize and safeguard it’s own weaknesses is a strength all it’s own.<br />
<br />
Irresponsible Captain Tylor was originally available from Manga entertainment, but after that company ceased to exist, it was picked up by Right Stuf, who have released the series in several different DVD sets that vary in terms of size, price and box art.  You can buy whichever set you want off of Ebay or Amazon, and while I personally cheaped out and bought the thinpack from Rightstuf.com during their winter sale(cost me like fifteen bucks, hell yeah!) I’d have to strongly recommend the Ultra Edition.  In addition to being a much more attractive item in general, it comes with the series itself, the soundtrack, an artbook, one of the original light novels, and a bunch of supplemental materials.  You can find that collection for anywhere between forty and sixty dollars on Amazon and Ebay.  <br />
<br />
I had my complaints about this series, and while I do feel that they’re valid, it does make up for these issues just enough so that I can still highly recommend it to pretty much any viewer who’s looking to have a good time.  It’s a bit of an underachiever as science fiction stories go, but it’s not a bad one by any means.  It’s an episodic character-driven story, which actually redeems a lot of the weaknesses in it’s plot when you consider jut how funny the story is and how awesome the majority of the characters are.  It’s aged surprisingly well despite being over twenty years old, and still has a lot of laughs to offer it’s audience even to this day.  Grab a copy for yourself, lighten up, and don’t think about it too hard.  I give Irresponsible Captain Tylor an 8/10.

     I remember like it was just yesterday, it was a cold Thursday in November and Thanksgiving break was just around the corner. It was the night before my Organic Chemistry I midterm and I was doing a bunch of last minute cramming. I had enough of NMRs, SN2 backside attacks, and reaction mechanisms, so I decided to take a study break and watch Irresponsible Captain Tylor. What was suppose to be a 30 minute break became a 26 episode marathon, and I ended up staying up all night watching the series and failing my midterm in the morning. That&#039;s how damn good the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49623">
        is. Tylor, the protagonist, is basically a master strategist or the luckiest, most clueless idiot that ever lived, due a bunch of circumstances, he ends up being the Captain of a space ship and his interactions with the crew and various (life or death) circumstances  are freaking hilarious. You&#039;ll just want to keep watching the next episode just to see what kind of stupid crap he&#039;ll pull next to upset his enemies, woo the ladies, advance the story etc. The dub is also excellent and Crispin Freeman who voices Tylor actually adopts a happy go lucky, aloof, goofy tone of voice that you don&#039;t often hear from him. If you&#039;re looking for an anime with comedy, space battles, an awesome Captain, this show is for you<br />
<br />
Bottom line: I failed an O Chem exam because I decided to marathon this series instead of studying, AND I&#039;D DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. The fact that I was able to drop that said exam from my overall grade had no influence on my decision. &gt;___&gt;

    I generally love shows that take themselves seriously. Shows that know what you&#039;re here for- a journey that involves deep, interesting characters, in worlds that are interesting to explore, with beautiful art and dramatic sakuga. <br />
<br />
This is not one of those shows. <br />
<br />
The Irresponsible Captain Tylor is a show about one specific character- the namely Tylor- and how he infuses the serious, dramatic, somewhat scary world he lives in with a flare of comedy. He hasn&#039;t got the seriousness, anger, or power of anything that is common at all for people of this world. Instead, he&#039;s simple minded, somewhat lazy, and does whatever he wants,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379003">
        whenever he wants. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story of The Irresponsible Captain Tylor is one that can&#039;t be easily surmised. It&#039;s initial draw- Tylor himself- is what forces the show forward for its initial first half. The comedy of this tired, simple, rumored genius of a man is what drives the story&#039;s comedy for the first half as well. <br />
<br />
The main plot is about a war with the Raugon Empire, who, after losing their leader to what is rumored to be an assasination from the UPSF(United Planet Space Force), have to rely on a young Empress Azazel to lead them through war. Meanwhile, on both sides, there are people looking to churn the gears of war to thier own gain. <br />
<br />
Tylor, however, is having none of this war nonsense, and charges straight in... only to surrender 5 minutes in. It&#039;s a comedic dynamic that&#039;s absolutely hilarious, from the serious personnel around him, to the rowdy crew, to many of the other unique personalities that are aboard the ship, Sozokage.  <br />
<br />
However, as the show goes on into the second half, it develops into a truly stunning space drama that will leave you stunned. The twists that come up are stunning, the romantic chemistry tangible, and everything about it is wonderful. Well, except for episode 23. There&#039;s a whole plot point about underage pregnancy, and its explicitly stated that the person in question is 16 by the narrator that talks at the end of each episode. It&#039;s awkward and creepy for western audiences. If you get uncomfortable from that, then please, don&#039;t watch episode 21. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art of the show, especially the character design, is peak 90&#039;s. The lithe girls compare very well to sailor moon, without looking like copy pastes of each other. The raugon are essentilally designed with a mix of a turkish dressing style, and elven features, which is interesting. The ships are massive, insectoid, steel things. The men, especially the crew, looking like 80&#039;s action tropes. <br />
The final thing I have to talk about are the fights. And by that, I mean the mega lasers that come in the battles between the humans and raugon. The fights are exactly what you&#039;d expect. <br />
<br />
Overall, however, there&#039;s nothing extraordinary here, except for maybe the detail that&#039;s put into the ship. You get to know everywhere that the main show takes places- namely, the Sozokage- very well, and it stays internally consistent, which is amazing. <br />
<br />
That doesn&#039;t mean the art isn&#039;t really good, though. This show makes me think &quot;Evangelion lite without a budget&quot; and that&#039;s entirely a good thing. The art was really great, but if you don&#039;t like that sort of trigun/evangelion style, then this isn&#039;t your show.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The actual, physical pieces of music themselves aren&#039;t that much to talk to your mom about. &quot;Just Think about Tomorrow&quot;, the OP, is probably the best of it, being a classic 90&#039;s piece, all in english- odd for anime. The rest is general fare, however. Nothing special. The ending was kinda lame and forgettable, which gave me reason to click the next episode as soon as it ended. The dramatic tracks were average, but good enough for what they were meant to do. The classic comedy track that was used constantly throughout the anime was good enough not to be annoying by the end of it, though. Though that might have just been because I was laughing during those times too much to notice. <br />
<br />
However, the sound effects are on point. I found that everything had sort of an old, rusted down sound to them, which let me get immersed even more in this wacky ship that takes us around space. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Welcome to where this show shines. I&#039;ll start with the supporting cast, and then get to tyler.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast for this show could fill up an entire 3-4 other anime. It&#039;s split into a few different groups. You have the bridge, the marines and pilots, the raugon, and the UPSF. <br />
<br />
The bridge is filled by possibly the only 2 serious LG goody goodys in this whole show- Captain Makoto Yamamoto and Commander Yuriko Star. Both of them have been &quot;Dumped&quot; on the Sozokage, a ship notorious for short lived bridge crews. The two try to get the ship in order, and in a sense, I guess they succeed. It&#039;s mostly through Tylor though. They&#039;re the two who spend the most time around tylor, and lots of the comedy stems from them being shocked and angry at his rule blowing attitude, without being able to do anything. However, they also soon grow out of that, learning how strict they were, and growing for the better.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The marines and pilots are the reason why many bridge staff end up leaving. They&#039;re rowdy, don&#039;t listen to order, and generally like to mutiny their own ship. However, Tylor doesn&#039;t really give them any reason to, as he earns respect through his sheer luck. The marines and pilots soon change to a bunch of rough and rowdy 80&#039;s tropes, eager to get into a fight and prove themselves. It&#039;s awesome to see them change to more rule abiding people, and grow for the better. <br />
<br />
The raugon are weird. We really only see a few people, the notable ones being Azazel and Dom. Dom initially looks like any of the Empress Azazel&#039;s council members, but after noticing her cry when on her own, becomes a confider of her secrets, and grows to respect Tylor on his own. I won&#039;t spoil Azazel, however, because that was really interesting to me. <br />
<br />
The UPSF consists of two people, Admiral Mifune, and Admiral Fuji, who both adamently hate Tylor&#039;s blind luck and laziness. Despite his results, they make for the &quot;Jesse and James&quot; of this show, scheming to take him down and have a reason to demote or fire him, only to fail hilariously because of circumstance and Tylor&#039;s dumb luck. It&#039;s one of the funnier tropes that the show plays into. <br />
<br />
Finally, Tylor. There&#039;s not much to say. He&#039;s the comedic and dramatic centerpoint of this show, and it shows. His dumb luck gets him out of the craziest situations. His inability to &quot;take things seriously&quot; leads to lots of comedy with the other cast, especially Dom, Yuriko, and Yamamoto. Without him, this would be a boring space drama. However, his antics eventually pull the whole group together to a sort of family, which becomes heartwarming at certain points to see. We even learn about what actually breaks the facade of normalcy around Tylor, as the show leans more into the drama in its back half. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a show i&#039;ve enjoyed more that went as hard as this one has. There are contenders for sure- Konosuba comes to mind as something that went from comedic to heartwarming at some points. The comedy in this show shines as a true subversion that was designed for the 90&#039; space drama. In a world where Trigger style endings exists, this show is perfect if you&#039;re getting bored of that. I know I was after Darling in the FranXX. The show was funny, but never felt like it&#039;s goal was to get me to laugh at one specific thing, which is refeshing. I don&#039;t have to be told what to do, just like Justy Ueki Tylor, and the fact that I can say that is credit for how damn good this show is. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
9/10. There are a few things holding this back from a true 10/10. Firstly, the OST for this is kind of average at best, and never really gets a chance to shine. Secondly, episode 21 was disturbing as a western viewer with western standards. Finally, the art could stand to innovate a little more.<br />
<br />
Those are small compared to the magnitude at which this show got me to laugh, however, My dad came in multiple times to see what I was watching, just because i was laughing so much. The OP is decent, the comedy is amazing, the characters probably couldn&#039;t be better suited for a comedic drama, and the story itself fits itself around Tylor perfectly. Also, seriously, Tylor is amazing. Like, REALLY good. Like, &quot;one of my favorite characters of all time&quot; good. Seriously, watch this show. It&#039;s free, on youtube, cuz Ritestuff are cool like that.<br />
Just watch this show, please.

    Have you ever worked under a boss who only found negatives in your performance and ignored literally every positive? He/She abides strictly by the company policy and allows no leeway for you to have fun or express yourself individually, fearing you may upset customers and ruin the reputation of the organization. He/She puts on the persona of being a hardass because they feel as if treating you like an actual human being will make you lazy and content, so to be a drill sergeant is the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
Justy Ueki “Captain” Tylor is the opposite of that. He refuses to carry himself as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302845">
        haughty authoritative figure and lowers his status to that of his subordinates so that he can communicate with them on a personal level. Each of his employees are allowed to express their full personalities and establish their individuality away from being homogenized dogs of the military. He routinely breaks protocol for the sake of maintaining the morale and safety of his crew, ensuring that they will not be needlessly sacrificed to fulfill the political agendas of a corrupt military operation. Go figure - treating your employees like human beings actually makes them better at their jobs. Send the memo to my supervisor. <br />
<br />
Tylor is truly among the great boss figures in anime. He makes you want to be a member of the Soyokaze where everyone is treated equally and with respect, a scarce reality in the world we live in today. This is where Irresponsible Captain Tylor shines most - immersing the viewer into a fictional work environment that is conducive to personal growth and where everyone is having the time of their lives on a grand adventure within the endless bounds of the galaxy. <br />
<br />
That this adventure is led by an &quot;Irresponsible Captain&quot; brings up an important question that the anime throughly explores throughout the narratives - how can a successful captain possibly be irresponsible, and what determines irresponsibility? Tylor is certainly responsible in caring for the safety of his subordinates in contrast to other commanders who willingly sacrifice human life for the sake of honor. But because he dresses sloppily and uses unconventional tactics to overcome obstacles, that makes him irresponsible? The show does a lot to offer a definition of the term through the actions of Tylor relative to other captains who are not nearly as successful as he is, despite being more formal.<br />
<br />
Another dilemma this anime stresses, and certainly the most important, is if Tylor is truly a lucky moron who miraculously pulls victory out of the jaws of defeat, or is he actually a strategic genius who pretends to be an idiot to avoid responsibility? The truth of which is never fully explained to the viewer who is encouraged to interpret in whatever way they wish. My take is that he’s neither a brilliant strategist nor is he simply lucky - he’s phenomenal at enabling people to be their best and cares more for their safety than anything else. By being nice to people, they in turn desire to help him succeed and play a huge factor in the successes of his missions that appear to be miraculously achieved by his lonesome. Kindness drives the success of the greatest space captain, not intellect nor luck, very similar to the charm of Monkey D Luffy who’s greatest strength stems from his ability to make friends. Neither would be successful as captains without relying on the strength of their allies. <br />
<br />
Similar to Luffy, Tylor’s kindness extends beyond his race and includes the alien Raalgon empire who are mortal enemies to the human space federation. The leadership of these groups have historically relied upon stereotypes of the opposing factions without knowing the individuality of each person, and Tylor is the perfect person in command to bridge the gap between them. That his laid back demeanor and sloppy appearance rapidly becomes the face of an entire military organization is a purposeful satire of misaligned military priorities that emphasize strictness over compassion, exact order over variation.<br />
<br />
This anime is usually referenced for being a funny parody of space opera narratives - of which is definitely true, you’re going to laugh a lot  - but there’s also serious commentary on military corruption and wrongfully stereotyping individuals by the faction they belong to that can be found in most other sci-fi/war narratives, most notably Mobile Suit Gundam. Corruption and greed are not exclusive qualities of a race or social group - that there are bad apples everywhere is consistently emphasized within the narrative.<br />
<br />
Irresponsible Captain Tylor deserves to be recognized not only for the comedy, but also the powerful message of a leader treating their underlings like the individuals that they are rather than soulless drones whose only purpose in life is their job description. That this anime can work both as an hilarious parody of space opera tropes AND provide relevant commentary on social concerns that we all face every day is really outstanding. This anime has aged remarkably well and should continue to be relevant forever.<br />

    Brilliantly written and exciting, this is an anime that should not be missed. The series centers on the career of the young and Irresponsible Captain Tylor, who is easy going, laid back and in general, someone you would not want to follow into battle.<br />
<br />
The drama that unfolds and the weaving plot only help to excite the viewer.  Facing into the jaws of death and an Irresponsible Captain in command of the ship... how long can he and his crew survive? Tylor not only faces danger from a superior alien race but also from his own crew, as his antics raise their anxiety and fears.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39525">

<br />
The cast of characters work together brilliantly; - with an Irresponsible Captain, a drunken doctor, a seductive nurse, a responsible second in command and a very serious lieutenant not to mention the delinquent crew of misfits.  The crew does an excellent job in expressing their `unease’, which only adds to the comedic effect of the series.  <br />
<br />
Whilst the plot may not be the most complicated, you will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat wondering how Tylor and his crew will get out of each situation with amazing suspense and laughable surprises.<br />
<br />
Irresponsible Captain Tylor is definitely a unique sci-fi comedy and hopefully one day the series will be continued... long live Captain Tylor!

    Warning: This review contains light spoilers.<br />
<br />
First impressions: So when I first heard about this series, what I was given to understand that it was some sort of parody of Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Space Battleship Yamato. Not exactly a setter of the highest of expectations. As the saying goes though, you can&#039;t judge a book by its cover, something that’s especially the case with Irresponsible Captain Tylor.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
At first Tylor seems like your very run of the mill 90’s anime, featuring space, aliens, an episodic plot structure, light ecchi elements and lots of comedy. Fortunately though, this proves not to be the entirely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307604">
        case, as while the story progresses, it becomes more than just a happy-go-lucky space adventure. It does this through the addition of the themes and messages it explores, such as learning how to deal with responsibility and the virtues of avoiding fruitless pre-existing reasoning constraints. Possibly the biggest draw to the series though is the comedy. There’s a running joke in the series that arises from the juxtaposition between the results of Tylor’s actions and what those actions imply about him and the reality behind them and him. Thus the question arises in the minds of tangential forces to Tylor as to if he’s just a idiot with the devil’s own luck or an unrivaled tactical genius. It’s this contrast between expectation and reality, as well as the moves that are made as the result of that misunderstanding that the show makes its comedic break and butter, to excellent effect too. Not only does Tylor manage to make this joke funny, but it even manages to somehow keep it fresh throughout by also playing on the show’s nature as a space opera parody. It’s damn impressive and very moving that the people making this series put so much effort into it as far as storytelling goes, specially considering the state of light novel adaptations now. Unfortunately, a big issue with it is that it&#039;s an incomplete series, even considering the existence of the OVAs. While the TV series may have ended on a high note, there’s still uncovered content and plot points in need of expanding on. This necessitates the viewers search for the unfortunately unavailable light novel for proper closure, cheating them out of the full experience. Other that this glaring issue though, the story’s pretty good.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
Main character Justy Ueki Tylor is at face value is a happy go lucky idiot, who always maintains an indifferent policy towards the concept of rules, regulations or anything getting in the way of his good time. Or at least so he would seem initially. While that is indeed a pretty accurate statement, there’s a lot more to him than what meets the eye. Some of Tylor’s core values can be boiled down to &quot;don&#039;t live according to someone else&#039;s rules&quot; and &quot;do what you want the way you want to&quot;. Values that manifest themselves as a casual disregard for orders and basic military structure, which are the most telling of his character. As such, the Tylor we get is basically what happens when you give a free spirited, lazy, irresponsible airhead actual authority. Despite his accidental success though there are some things he does which actually warrant praise, as well as merits he possesses that contribute to his overall success as a leader. To name a few, his understanding of his crew and how to get them to their full potential, his very unpredictable nature, his unusual humility, his honesty and when push come to shove, his selflessness, indicated by his willingness to risk his own life for the safety of his crew. <br />
<br />
Aside from the man himself though, I’d like to mention a few crew members that I believe are worth mentioning. The first one I’d like to mention is Yamamoto, Tylor’s right hand man and one of a few straight men to Tylor and his many antics. He’s a massive stickler for rules, regulations, proper protocol and all that good stuff, although despite this fact he starts to develop a deep respect for Tylor as the series goes on. This is triggered by Tylor giving himself to the Raalgon empire, so the crew of the Soyokaze could be saved. It’s only after seeing this act of self-sacrifice that Yamamoto starts to question his perception of Tylor as an irresponsible, airheaded idiot. As a result, he quickly begins to feel unworthy of his military and social position. This is turn inspires him to re-evaluate his way of doing things and go against everything he knows in his pursuit to rescue Tylor from the Raalgon empire.<br />
<br />
Another character which also stands out is Azalyn, the newly appointed empress of the Raalgon empire. The interesting thing with her is that she starts out as a normal teenage girl, at least for a princess, until the assassination of the preview Emperor, when an unfathomable level of responsibility for a normal person is foisted onto her. As a result, recognizing the importance of her new duties, puts on the front of being a level-headed and authoritative ruler, despite the pressure being very close to too much for her in the inside. Then somewhere down the line, she meets Tylor. It’s then that after being exposed to his personality and way of doing things, new desires and feelings are awakened inside her, prompting her to want to relinquish her position empress. Fortunately for her people, after talking to she reaffirms the importance of her position and leaves aside what might have been. This time with a stronger than ever will to improve herself as an empress and become a better leader for her people.<br />
<br />
There are also other characters I could talk more about in greater depth, like Yuriko Star,<br />
the straight woman of Tylor’s crew, but for the sake of brevity I’ll abstain from doing so, instead opting to give sound thoughts of the rest of the crew as a whole. That being said, the rest of the cast are decent. Some of the characters are better than others, although even then, in the case of Tylor’s crew that’s made up for by the fact that even the simple characters, through their relationships and overall dynamic, as a whole are amazing and manage to give the Soyokaze a real sense of life. Other than that though, most of the other characters are just kinda whatever.<br />
<br />
Visuals: 7/10<br />
Tylor’s animation is just amazing, looking very fluid and lively. Not only does its looks brilliant for the time it came out, it still looks great even now at the time this review is being written. The backgrounds look decent for their time, with special attention going to the excellent job this series does at capturing both the emptiness and viscerally surreal beauty of space. The billions of constellations, that glow and shine of the stars, but also seemingly endless cold, empty void. Included are some very nice, and definitely most appreciated 90’s visuals, energy shields and lighting effects, essentially any old school fan’s dream come true. Character designs while being bog standard for the time, have a lot of charm to them, especially marine core members of the crew, who are the craziest looking bunch of characters I’ve seen in this series to date. Looking at you Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. So quite a few visual comically quirky touches to be found. All in all Tylor does really well in the visual department.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
The opening theme is amazing, both the japanese and English, so much so that I opted to add the song on my pc. It’s not only catchy, but comes with a very up-beat message that fits the series very well. The ending theme on the other hand while fitting for the series, just doesn&#039;t really click with me. Maybe it&#039;s the somber tone or just the visuals. Whatever it may be, the ending’s just not my thing. The ost by Kenji Kawai of Ghost in the Shell, Ranma ½ and Mob Psycho 100 is decent. While not good enough for me to listen to on its own, the tracks never fail to add something special to the scenes they’re in and help give the series its signature charm. The sub and dub are both viable ways to consume the series, although It’s worth mentioning that while the sub is fine, I prefer the dub for this series, The the English voice actors just manage to put so much emotion into their roles, making them feel more convincing than in the sub as a result, with a special mention going out to Crispin Freeman giving 110% at giving 0% as Tylor.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Captain Tylor is the GOAT and honestly one of the reasons I continue watching anime. It&#039;s very rare for a series to keep me entertained this much even after multiple rewatches. Maybe it’s the 90’s aesthetic elements that I’m oh so very biased towards, but the story and characters while simple, have a lot of cham to them. The series feels like it has a real heart and soul to it, rather than just being an empty product placement for the light novel it’s based on.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
Irresponsible Captain Tylor is a bonafide 90’s anime classic and one of the best series ever produced during that period, and is perfectly indicative of the type of anime that gave that period its soul. Not only that, but as a comedy it works so well on so many levels and has a wide cast of characters that feel so very alive and human. It’s the fucking GOAT! End of story.<br />

    I had an itch to watch something from the 1990s a few months back and thus stumbled upon Irresponsible Captain Tylor. Right on the front page of this Anime&#039;s MAL summary page, it has almost all 10/10s across the board. Me personally I tend not to listen to MAL when it comes to review scores but even upon seeing great scores for this Anime, I&#039;ve also researched about the Anime from old school fans who are way older than me and still the Anime was met with high praise.<br />
<br />
Thus I set out to watch Captain Tylor and boy was I not disappointed. From just the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229204">
        first episode it kept me sucked in. This is first and foremost a comedy Anime, but at times it got emotional. Each and every character in this amazing Anime had a distinct yet familiar personality. They will stick with you long after you even finish watching the Anime.<br />
<br />
The story is set up in a way that seems typical from Anime of this era. Alien race wants to fight humans so people fight in space but that&#039;s where the cliche ends. Taylor as a character is the highlight of the entire show and his role is the most important. <br />
<br />
This anime is so good because the characters were at first set in stone in terms of what they were like on a personal level but Tylor&#039;s personality influenced each and every person around him. His easygoingness shaped the very foundation of these influences and connections to other characters.<br />
<br />
Tylor is your typical 20 something guy who didn&#039;t know what to do in life so he joined the military maybe to get some excitement and that&#039;s where it goes from there. I do not want to spoil anything you just have to experience this masterpiece for yourself. You WILL be laughing every episode. Each and every episode is so well executed and balanced with both life lessons and comedy.<br />

    Let me first say I didn&#039;t think I was going to like this anime, my older brother recommended it to me so I decided to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
Irresponsible Captain Tylor is truly a remarkable anime series.  It blends all the types of tv shows perfectly.  Drama, action, romance, comedy, Sci-fi, are done perfectly.  At the end of the show you don&#039;t know what type of anime it truly was.<br />
<br />
The story follows Lt. Commander Justy Ueki Tylor who stumbles into the Space Navy.  He has no real purpose in life, and knack for getting into trouble.  He some how manages

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1444">
        to get command of a destroyer to the crews dismay.  Though the crew are the rejects of the Space Navy.  So this band of screw ups and rejects along with perhaps the only two sain officers in Lt. Commander Yuriko Star and Lieutenant Makoto Yamamoto begin their misadventures in space.  It starts off being a pure comedy, but by half way through it&#039;s so much for.  At the end you don&#039;t really know whether now Captain Tylor is a genius or a complete idiot.<br />
<br />
I have to recommend this anime to everyone.  I really think anyone who watches the series and OVA will love it.

    This is my first review, so bare with me please. Anyways about Irresponsible Captain Tylor, where do i start, i got started into the series  because of a recommendation from a friend. Little did i know how much i was going to enjoy the series, because when you look at it at a first glance it doesn&#039;t look anything special, or unique. However Irresponsible Captain Tylor proved me wrong, the humor was very unique and interesting and the characters just keep you laughing, as well as hard to stay on your chair without falling out laughing, as well making me curious whatever if Captain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25286">
        Tylor is really a genius, or a absolute fool.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY = 9<br />
<br />
<br />
The overall story is a mixture of humor, drama, romance, and sprinkle of little action all boiled in a pot. The humor is predictable and unpredictable, as you know what to expect next from Captain Tylor, but at the same time you don&#039;t know what else he is going to do. The main titular character Tylor, as you watch just suddenly appears at a recruiting station wanting to join the army of the Earth Federation, thinking being in the army would be a easy life. The drama is slightly over the top, with &quot;What&#039;s going to happen how are we going to get out of this mess&quot; however there are occasional seriousness at parts, which shows its not all fun and games, well sometimes its not all fun and games. The action i do not know if to consider it action since i laugh so hard when watching the action happening, but as with drama there are serious times of actions. The reason i gave the story a 9 is that there are some parts in the story that i think they could&#039;ve done so much more with, especially in the later part.<br />
<br />
ART = 9 <br />
<br />
The Art style is more impressive especially the time period when it was produced in the 90&#039;s, i say the art is more impressive than most of the other series produced in the 90&#039;, the art looks smooth, shading looks very wonderful.<br />
<br />
SOUND = 10<br />
<br />
The soundtracks impressed me very much, the music set the overall tune of what&#039;s going to happen. To prove my point just go to this link<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLO2rpEz9eo<br />
<br />
In this link has the teaser trailer of Captain Tylor, that has the background music of series<br />
<br />
CHARACTER = 9<br />
<br />
The character is what really give the show its shine, especially the main Titular character Captain Tylor. Captain Tylor is the lucky man who things go his way on luck, he also a slight womanizer. This man who joins the army because he wanted a easy life, somehow manages to become a captain of a cruiser. At one point in the series, the commanders don&#039;t know whatever Captain Tylor is a genius or a complete Idiot, though the crew beg to differ. So the character development is up to you, the viewer.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT = 10<br />
<br />
The enjoyment is outstanding i never had so much fun watching a series and laughed so hard because of unique sense of humor. This is also the first anime series i have seen that gives homage to the american pop culture with the reference to Jason Vorhess from Friday the thirteen since there is a crew member whose name is Jason and also has a hockey mask on.<br />
<br />
Overall i recommend this series to anyone looking for a good laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />

    There are many &quot;protagonist focused&quot; shows like this one that I really enjoy, the most popular being &quot;One punch man&quot;,&quot;Trigun&quot; and &quot;Violet Evergarden&quot;. These series focus around a strong MC and concept. This show is amazing because it is very easy to sell to anyone who likes anime or comedy just by giving them the premise, more so to nerds who grew up on space odysseys like Star Trek. <br />
<br />
The plot and characters 10<br />
<br />
A very strong cast and events that hook you in instantly. You will find yourself asking every arc- &quot;How will they get out of this one ?&quot; and by the end you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407830">
        will feel a sense of deep satisfaction. Much like the before mentioned &quot;protagonist focused shows&quot; this one has much to say about the involved parties drive and motivations towards life. The strength of the premise and character writing creates fun, memorable situations.  Somewhere by the end of the plot there will be a great surprise waiting that made watching it to the end a rewarding experience.<br />
<br />
The rest 8 - 9<br />
<br />
I am not one to judge the technical quality of the show from the year I was learning to walk and speak, so I will give it this rating because it did not bother me, but did not seriously impress me either.

    Captain Tylor became one of the first anime to truly touch on a comedy space opera, a dimwit main character, and eventually his very own harem. Directed by Naoyuki Yoshinaga (Maison Ikkoku, Patlabor) gave some hope that this could be a good comedy like Ikkoku with some space comedy elements emanating Patlabor in the mech genre. It was not too far off, but since the anime was produced by Tatsunoko Production (Genesis Climber, MegaZone 23) there was bound to be some disappointments in what could have been something special.<br />
<br />
Much like the companies past works, nothing spectacular in animation, sound, or music; just a plain average

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210334">
        feeling anime. The character designs were plain and somewhat irritating (Tylor’s jacket for example), characters were incredibly ‘arche-typed’ with little to no development, and the little plot was distracted by needless fillers and bland comedy.<br />
<br />
In a setting focusing on a space war between an alien race (Raalgan Empire) against the humans (UPSF), the main character Justy Ueki Tylor fits the role of a lazy bonehead who joins the military wanting an easy-going life working as a salary man. However, Tylor accidently does many things and succeeds without a plan lands himself a captain position on a run-down ship called the Soyokaze. The ship is known for housing people who could not make it in the normal military. Over time Tylor wins battles, the crew’s hearts, enemies within the UPSF, and the enemies respect. This anime does have its charm, and the simplicity of it is there.<br />
<br />
The Irresponsible Captain Tylor stays true to what it is: a simple plot, simple characters, with average production. Tylor never changes his ways, which also attributes to the shows charm. In many ways, this is a spoof on the space opera taking away from the Yamato series. Take it for what it is.

    Musekinin Kanchou Tylor a pure comedic anime which i love from the bottom of my heart. in general i don&#039;t like space anime that much but this anime change my thoughts about this genre. Everything in this anime is completely outstanding. This anime is a pure masterpiece which excellently blended the parody and space genre.<br />
<br />
Story-9<br />
<br />
The story of this anime is very simple and excellent. The true focus of the story was comedy and parody but in times some drama and action can also be seen. Without giving any major spoilers i will give a little summary of this anime- The story revolves around the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306044">
        character &quot;Tylor&quot;. He is a stupid person who just wants to earn some money and makes his life better so in order to do that he joins the space military force and with help of his luck he manages to become the commander of the spaceship but in times some redeeming quality of him was also shown.<br />
<br />
Art-8<br />
<br />
The art of this anime is very good compared to the year it came. As we all know the space genre is one of the genre which is tough to draw the spaceships , cities , characters all was drawn perfectly. Almost every details can be seen in the anime. This type of art style perfectly fits this type of space anime.<br />
<br />
Sound-8<br />
<br />
In this area i can not say that its best but its also not that worst. The crew of this anime can do better in this area. The op of this anime is good but the ed was not that good and and as for the voices of the characters it did a very fine job. I personally liked the voices of all the main character its just fits them perfectly.<br />
<br />
Character-10<br />
<br />
This is the area where this anime stands on the top. Every character is just perfect and you will not come to hate any of them. I personally liked the main character his personality, attitude , stupidity everything just suits him. without any confusion he is one of my all time favourite character.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-9<br />
<br />
From this anime i was able to redeem a very good quality of enjoyment. I enjoyed every moment of this anime the comedy of this anime is very good Even for a second the thought of dropping this anime never came in my mind. From the very first episode you will able to enjoy this anime so rest easy and go for it without any doubt<br />
<br />
Overall-9<br />
<br />
As you can see Overall this anime is just perfect. After watching this anime i can say proudly that every episode is worth watching. One of the best space anime with comedy in it. So i do say you should go for it.<br />
<br />
Atlast, I just want to say this anime is very underrated if this anime came in this decade instead of 1990s i can surely say it will be a mainstream anime so if you are a mainstream anime watcher you should go for it. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time. If any way i was able to help you please click the &quot;it is helpful&quot; button.

    I&#039;m a big fan of &quot;obfuscating stupidity&quot; (look it up on TVtropes). So, I was looking forward to watching Irresponsible Captain Tylor despite my general dislike for space operas and military anime in general. And with good reason. <br />
<br />
After a google search, I caught a snippet somewhere that theorized Captain Tylor is a bodhisattva who is attempting to enlighten his crew. With that thought in mind, I got great enjoyment out of reading into Tylor&#039;s behavior and guessing his motives. Episodes 25 and 26 particularly make sense if you believe the series to be an allegory for &quot;the nature of a Bodhisattva&quot;:<br />
<br />
&quot;The nature of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21180">
        Bodhisattva is apparent from a teaching story in which three people are walking through a desert. Parched and thirsty, they spy a high wall ahead. They approach and circumnavigate it, but it has no entrance or doorway. One climbs upon the shoulders of the others, looks inside, yells &quot;Eureka&quot; and jumps inside. The second then climbs up and repeats the actions of the first. The third laboriously climbs the wall without assistance and sees a lush garden inside the wall. It has cooling water, trees, fruit, etc. But, instead of jumping into the garden, the third person jumps back out into the desert and seeks out desert wanderers to tell them about the garden and how to find it. The third person is the Bodhisattva.&quot; (From Wikipedia)<br />
<br />
You can enjoy Irresponsible Captain Tylor for the light comedy it is on the surface. And you can fall in love with the series if you feel like analyzing the Buddhist message underneath.<br />
<br />
Philosophical undercurrents aside, this series was just plain fun to watch. Tylor&#039;s antics are hilarious. His crew is eccentric. The music is quintessentially 90s J-pop, and is thus made of awesome. I could watch the trippy OP over and over.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I want to have Paco-Paco&#039;s baby too!

    Irresponsible Captain Tylor is a comedy. The main character, Tylor is the captain of a destroyer, THE SOYOKAZE, in the UPSF (United Planets Space Force), who is fighting the Raalgon Empire. He is the commander of characters such as: Yuriko Star - Lt. Commander, Yamomoto - First officer; a bunch of marines, 3 pilots (Kojiro, Emi, Yumi), and several others.<br />
<br />
Tylor is always doing extremely stupid of highly intelligent things (they never say if he&#039;s a genius or just an idiot). For example, he defeats entire Raalgon  fleets with his single destroyer, just by &quot;luck&quot; as he calls it (others call it stupidity or ingenious

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21287">
        tactics).<br />
<br />
My interpretation is that Tylor is a genius. After all, he definitely seems to act wise in front of his crew, like saying things such as, &quot;Don&#039;t live under someone else&#039;s rule; live life like you want to.&quot; Furthermore, he definitely seems to have exceptional plans in some episodes.

    The Irresponsible Captain Tylor resides in the niche realm of feel-good space shows. There&#039;s no real drama or tragedy, despite Justy Ueki Tylor deciding to join a military unit because there&#039;s a sexy lady in the ad. This series is laid-back and it focuses on the slice-of-life misadventures of the crew. It reminded me a lot of Oscar Wilde&#039;s The Importance of Being Earnest, but it more extolled the virtues of not taking life so seriously, rather than being a parodical take on the fickle values of the aristocracy.<br />

⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️<br />

—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
Justy Ueki Tylor is like if Yang Wenli from Ginga Eiyū

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361205">
        Densetsu, except if Wenli gave zero care about anything! Despite all of the staff on the Soyokaze initially being angry at Captain Tylor&#039;s lackadaisical attitude, they are eventually charmed by his simplicity and they discover that being chill often gets things done more efficiently, rather than being stressed out! The cast and crew are showcased with each subsequent episode of comedic hijinks. Tylor&#039;s lax attitude even makes the threat of the Holy Raalgon Empire look like child&#039;s play!<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t spoil anything for anyone wanting to watch this series, but there&#039;s actually a romantic relationship that actually goes somewhere in this series! I know that a lot anime fans get peeved about the excess of platonic relationships!<br />

Commentary: Mr. Mashimo is the CEO of Bee Train and he has a specific style. You can compare and contrast the animation sequences from every Bee Train show with the sequence in the ED of The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, and see the similarities! Captain Tylor is very much a product of the 1990s though, and with that, each space-adventure show has similarities to series such as: Seihō Bukyō Outlaw Star and Kidō Senkan Nadesico! Despite that, the cell animation frames are very clean and the animation is fluid for its time, you can tell the nuance in the directing of certain scenes! Musekinin Kanchō Tylor is a beautiful visual spectacle!<br />

Commentary: One of the best composers in anime worked in this! Personally one of my favorites, as a teenager, Mr. Kawai was one of the first composers in the anime scene that I knew by name. His tracks are often ethereal and otherworldly, and his work on Musekinin Kanchō Tylor is no exception! Mr. Kawai presents us with a stunning, space-centric soundtrack. There&#039;s a notable OST track in Episode 2 that I quite enjoyed where a comedy sequence is interluded with a punchy, marimba track! It&#039;s always a treat to listen to Mr. Kawai&#039;s compositions bring a series to life!<br />
<br />
I watched The Irresponsible Captain Tylor with the English dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors.<br />

Commentary: Mr. Freeman is one of the most famous talents in the dubbing industry, and for good reason! Although I prefer his voice with the dark, brooding, mysterious characters... his works on characters like Justy Ueki Tylor and Hideki Motosuwa (Chobits) have a certain charm to them as well! Wonderful vocal talent!<br />

* Martina Zoana Mel Navratilova, Slayers Next ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: I grew up hearing a lot of Ms. Lillis&#039; work, so I have a nostalgic fondness in her feisty, tomboyish characters! Though it did make me chortle a little bit, to know that Yuriko Star practically has the same voice as Misty from Pokémon!<br />

* Zodd Nosferatu, Berserk ✅<br />
* Suberoa Zinnerman, Kidō Senshi Gundam Unicorn<br />
* Bason, Shaman King ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: Mr. Brimmer doesn&#039;t have nearly as stacked of a filmography as his seiyū counterpart, but I really enjoyed his voice in Berserk and Shaman King! And he&#039;s able to perfectly convey Makoto Yamamoto as a neurotic, butt-monkey!<br />

* Lina Inverse, Slayers ✅<br />
* Amy Rose, Sonic X ✅<br />
* Shizuka Kawai (&quot;Serenity&quot;), Yū-Gi-Ō! ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: Ms. Ortiz is near and dear to my heart, because I grew up hearing her voice... as Lina Inverse in Slayers! And I freaking love that character! Her role as Shiori Takatsuki in the Central Park Media dub of Shōjo Kakumei Utena almost made me have Shiori as one of my favorite characters, even though she&#039;s the &quot;Queen Bee&quot;, master-manipulator! Ms. Ortiz made me fall in love with Deedlet in Lodoss-tō Senki and pine after Echidna in Queen&#039;s Blade! A great talent in the anime-voicing industry!<br />

This series is a laconic look into a time passed, and although rather slow-paced and straightforward, I&#039;m still planning on purchasing the boxset for this series on Blu-ray! If you want to kick your feet up on an ottoman and watch a bunch of fun characters, and a random cameo from Friday the 13th (there&#039;s a Jason Voorhees look-a-like in a ski-mask)! The conclusion is very heartfelt, too, it&#039;s apparent that the creator of this series genuinely loved all of the characters and even expanded the universe into a ten-episode OVA series! I strongly recommend this series for anyone looking for a wholesome, science-fiction adventure!<br />

    Absolutely terrible. If you are 12 years or older or you don&#039;t have brain damage, then you will not like this. guaranteed. it is very stupid, very unrealistic, not funny, terrible art, a complete waste of time. It takes itself too seriously to be a complete parody, yet it&#039;s dumber than any parody I&#039;ve ever seen, with absolutely horrible characters. the base conception seems good, an idiot lucky guy. too bad the implementation is -1/10. the guy is beyond stupid, too unrealistically stupid to be funny, because it doesn&#039;t have any resemblance to realism, so it just becomes meaningless. He &quot;acts&quot; so stupid that no

    Musekinin Kanchou Tylor or The Irresponsible Captain Tylor as it is better known, is the story of a lazy but idiotically lucky man - Justy Ueki Tylor. His goals in life are to join the space military, get a desk job and then get pension without tension after retirement. But, when he accidentally manages to rescue a retired admiral from a hostage situation, he is promoted as the Captain of the spaceship Soyozake. On top of it, the space military is almost at war with their arch enemies, The Holy Raalgon Empire. Now, how Tylor manages to save the universe from a great war through

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142691">
        a series of comedy of errors forms the rest of the story. By the end of the anime series, you&#039;d probably be left wondering if Tylor was foolishly lucky or were his actions, the strokes of an absolute genius.<br />
ART: 7/10<br />
Well, we are talking about an anime which was aired in 1993, so one cannot obviously expect to get KyoAni quality of 2014. Nevertheless, the art could have been quite better. It&#039;s pretty average stuff out there, the space scenes could have been a bit brighter and a few characters could&#039;ve been designed a bit less cartoonish. However, that being said, the main characters are all well crafted.<br />
CHARACTERS: 8/10<br />
This series sticks to the tried and tested formula of having a bunch of wacky characters in all sorts of weird situations.... and.... guess what? This formula delivers hilarious results! The main characters include the very laidback and goofy Tylor, Miss Obey-All-Rules Lt. Commander Yuriko Star, the military man by birth Lt. Makoto Yamamoto and the I-am-no-more-a-kid, Raalgon Empress - Azalyn Goza.  The other characters onboard the Soyozake also have great character structure and at first they do not get along, but as the series progresses, you&#039;ll find them standing up for each other and even risking their careers for the sake of their comrades. The characters from the Raalgon Empire are also well thought out and justified. All the voice actors have done a very commendable job indeed.<br />
STORY:9/10<br />
This is where this anime nails it. This genre of space-war-comedy is pretty rare and executing it rather well is usually tough. However, rest assured, the people behind Tylor have nailed this aspect all too well and the story is excellent, at times quite funny and at times thought-provoking. This series is actually a satire on war, on military mindset and how sometimes it&#039;s cool to be laidback and idiotic.<br />
MUSIC: 9/10<br />
Both the opening and ending songs seemed good and catchy to me. I particularly liked the ending song &quot;Downtown Dance&quot; out of the two. Although I do not have a really great ear for music, I particularly found the background music within the last few episodes very nice and melodious. I do not know which songs they are from, so if someone finds some info about them, please do inform me.<br />
CONCLUSION:8.5/10<br />
The Irresponsible Captain Tylor may not be the funniest comedy out there in the anime realm, but it really is worth the time invested in it. It has got its share of plot twists, laughs and philosophy. On the surface, it might look like another stupid sci-fi anime, but it definitely isn&#039;t. If nothing else, then it is one of the most brilliant pieces of satire ever made. <br />
