    (Please note, there are many spoilers in this review)<br />
<br />
I typed up probably seven different openers for this review before realizing that nothing I say can possibly prepare you for what&#039;s to come. This introduction, or lack thereof, actually goes on to mimic the underlying themes of this series in more ways than one. WorldEnd (Which also goes by the incredibly long title of &#039;What Are You Doing At The End Of The World? Are You Busy? Will You Save Us?&#039;) is more than just the hyperdramatic adaptation of a light novel going by the same name, it&#039;s a story about never being prepared; it&#039;s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251449">
        story about how everything in life comes and goes far too quickly for us to comprehend. But, at the same time, so much of the beauty in life can only be leeched from it due to its apparent absence in the first place.<br />
<br />
WorldEnd is a series that can, by no means, be nailed down to one general concept. The scope of its meaning is as vast as the world it takes place in -- a world in which humanity has all but vanished. The remaining life forms have taken to the skies, building civilizations upon floating islands and relying on creatures known as &#039;Leprechauns&#039; to fight in a never-ending war. The leprechauns in WorldEnd, however, are not your typical Irish, fun-loving drunkards. Instead, they are girls born from children who died before having anything to live for, and the main leprechaun who we follow throughout WorldEnd goes by the name Ctholly Nota Seniorious.<br />
<br />
Ctholly initially comes off as a sort of aloof, curious girl, struggling to fit in with a world full of disfeatured humanoids. The irony in this, however, is that those without extreme physical deformities (Or those who appear human) are actually the ones known as the &#039;disfeatured&#039; in WorldEnd. Partway through the pilot, we are also introduced to the second protagonist, Willem Kmetsch, as he encounters Ctholly for the first time. After showing her around the island for a bit, Ctholly departs and Willem is left on his own. Having recently fallen on hard times, he reluctantly takes on a job as the caretaker for a nearby military facility. Of course, he doesn&#039;t really understand what he&#039;s getting himself into until he shows up and it&#039;s less of a warehouse and more of an orphanage full of young girls. And while this seems like a pain to him at first, his attitude takes a dramatic shift when he realizes that these girls are the only weapons civilization has left.<br />
<br />
This is the first sign of tragedy out of many. Yes, the idea of young girls being used as weapons is rather unfortunate and incredibly sad. But throughout the next eleven episodes, the series begins to steamroll down a path in which we grow attached to every single one of them only to have those relationships severed and beaten by the end of the series. The most dramatic of all of these relationships, however, is the budding romance that slowly begins to flourish between Ctholly and Willem.<br />
<br />
Without giving away everything, something happens to Ctholly that begins to drain her sanity. Slowly but surely, her memories begin to fade and her hair begins to change colors, turning into a violent shade of red instead of her normal, subtle blue. The shift in hair colors is not just a shift in appearance, however. This physical change mimics the drastic mental change that is occurring within her at the same time. Ctholly is bombarded with confusing images and the voice of tortured young girl, speaking in eerie metaphors. And while none of what this voice is saying makes sense to us, the sheer manner in which they are said is enough to signify the deterioration of her psyche. The worst part of this is that Ctholly knows what&#039;s happening to her.<br />
<br />
Day after day, Ctholly remembers less of herself and clings tightly to the one thing she knows for sure -- that she&#039;s in love. She tosses aside her slightly-tsun outlook from earlier in the series and simply adopts the fact that she loves Willem, making it known to him every chance she gets. And while he spends a decent amount of time avoiding the subject, it&#039;s clear that Willem feels the same way. The steamrolling tragedy that we all know is coming screeches to a halt and, for just the slightest moment, everything is perfect. <br />
<br />
But then it&#039;s not.<br />
<br />
Willem takes Ctholly to a nearby military ship after catching wind of a weapon that could help her fading consciousness. When tuning one of the other leprechauns weapons, however, he discovers something that stays with him for the rest of the series. The monsters that these girls have been fighting have actually been humans the entire time. And while exactly how that happened remains open to interpretation for us viewers, it&#039;s crystal clear to Willem. His vision and outlook become distorted and he begins to lose his grip on reality in a way both incredibly similar and incredibly different to Ctholly. <br />
<br />
The final episode is like lightning -- it comes and it goes quicker than we&#039;re able to comprehend. Ctholly loses her grip on reality as battle breaks loose and slips into a coma. Willem, incapable of coping with the thought that this might be the end for her, erupts into a hate-fueled rage, slaughtering any monster he comes across as the rest of the army and several of the other leprechauns fight for their lives. One of the girls, Nephren, has a particularly harsh time with this, ultimately sacrificing herself so that a few others might live. Just as she collapses, however, Willem finds her. And, in a last-stitch effort so save something, he dives after her as she falls off of the airship.<br />
<br />
The following five minutes go on to create one of the most heartbreaking and tear-inducing scenes I have ever seen. Ctholly manages to persuade the girl inhabiting her mind to let her come back to reality one last time -- all so she could save Willem. Then, as she stands surrounded by corpses on the edge of the airship, her last strands of blue hair change to red and she dives. Freefalling thousands of feet in the air, Scarborough Fair and the endless barrage of strange, psychological metaphors from Elq assault our ears and our hearts as we watch this girl we&#039;ve fallen in love with trade away her sanity for someone else&#039;s happiness. A dual-monologue between Willem and Ctholly breaks out as she reappears out of thin air and desperately attacks the monsters surrounding him. As the monologue loses steam, Ctholly does as well. Her attacks slow as she is impaled by countless tendrils and lifted high up into the same sky she descended from just minutes ago.<br />
<br />
The battle comes to a close and everything we have grown to love over the past three months is stripped from us quicker than it was given. The few scenes that follow only make it harder.<br />
<br />
In Summary:<br />
What an incredibly heartfelt and gorgeous series this was. The amount of love put into this project is palpable on all accounts and, thanks to one of the most well-written female characters in years, the mark that WorldEnd leaves will be a lasting one. The harmonious blend of intimate Celtic music meshed with tragic fight scenes and flawless acting creates something much more immersive than you would normally find in any visual medium. For a few seconds, it even feels like we&#039;re there. Something that important is hard to put into words, but if I had to limit my description of this series to one, it would be &#039;beautiful&#039;. Please, set aside a night and watch this all in one go. You won&#039;t possibly regret it.

    Did you ever get that feel of &quot;this could be great if&quot; while reading or watching something? This feel is exactly what this anime is about. A story with huge potential, but undermined. Undermined by the author&#039;s lack of proper writing skills. By conventions of a degenerated form of writing. And by a not so good adaptation.<br />
<br />
This show can pass by as your average light novel adaptation with ease. Hella long title you won&#039;t remember no matter what. A cast of characters with names difficult to read or memorize. Male MC that shoves up people&#039;s ass his set of morals once in a while. MC&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251227">
        love interest that goes melodramatic and cry several times. Yet you can find here the tragedy of a man. A man that lost everything, and ends up in some state of suspended animation until he is awaken many years later in a &quot;foreign&quot; world (Captain America, huh?). The cute heroine is actually a weapon of mass destruction that can die any time for the sake of the world. High stakes for the love interests and the risk of emotional loss could make this a great love story, right?<br />
<br />
Problem is, the show couldn&#039;t decide whenever it wanted to be a dull light novel adaptation or a good story. This leaded to a confusing presentation and lack of self-awareness. Say, they present you with a little depth of Willem&#039;s character. It is reedeming and set him as a &quot;not your typical LN male MC at all&quot;. And, show a few seconds later one of the most cringe-inducing reactions that a plain tsundere girl can have. Breakdowns like this are destructive to suspension of disbelief.<br />
<br />
But in the long run, the show saves itself from the mediocrity valley. Remember the love story? What blooms here is the most organic romance I have seen in anime, at least in a while. Never two people falling in love with each other felt so natural. Chtholly (I swear I didn&#039;t look up the character list) slowly evolves into a housewife in hopes to become a better person for Willem. Willem in turn tries to overcome his own fears of another loss so he can give Chtholly the love she deserves. Both of them reach the stage of mutual love step by step. It&#039;s simple, but it works.<br />
<br />
The show goes up and down since episode one, between LN&#039;s conventions and good writing. There&#039;s a immersive post-apocalyptic setting. A well-tied set of emotional stakes, great OST and some gorgeous visuals. But there are one-sided characters, with single tropes defining them. Also a typical LN setup, and some crappy CGI.<br />
<br />
As bad as this series might sound, it&#039;s good enough. At least, the LN medium isn&#039;t completely doomed. The guy who wrote this is talented, but needs to polish his skills and broaden his writing experience, which seems narrow yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you fall in love at the end of the world?&quot; - This alone would be a better name, although still long. Keep your titles short and easy to read they say. The name &quot;SukaSuka&quot; means nothing to me. So how I&#039;m supposed to call for this show?

    When you see a title this long, it really raises the question if the creator put as much as creativity into his work as they did into the title. The original light novel is 5 volumes long while the anime adaptation is 12 episodes. So in essence, it shouldn’t be hard to adapt this into something fans can accept right? Well, that’s not entirely easy to answer as this show isn’t so easily recommendable to anyone. I will say this though, SukaSuka isn’t your typical fantasy thriller that just jumps right into the action. In fact, it’s far more than that as this series attempts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251212">
        to craft a tearjerking fantasy drama to reach expectations.<br />
<br />
I have to admit, watching SukaSuka took me some time to accept the story. The first few episodes has an atmospheric feel with its world setting, characters, and plot. We meet Willem, the male protagonist who happens to be the last human in a post-apocalyptic world. The show makes it clear that humans are extinct as the anime opens up with a battle scene involving them and the Beasts. Flash forward into the present timeline and we see how the world has changed since then. Now there are floating islands that feel so isolated from each other despite being populated with otherworldly species. One of the most prominent of these species are the Leprechauns, characters who can wield ancient Dug weapons that can destroy Beasts. In the meantime, Willem meets Chtholly, a leprechaun with a mysterious past. The show establishes Willem as a friend, father figure, and comrade for the Leprechauns.<br />
<br />
Right off the bat, I can say that SukaSuka’s characters are quite mysterious. Chtholly has a peculiar past that is explored throughout the show. Willem also has a past that I can say it’s too pleasant to remember. Then, there are the Leprechauns. The show creates an eerie feel as it blends them with child innocence and unsettling fear. It’s through revelations that Willem realizes what they really are and their roles in this series. Now, the more I got curious about the show, the more I wonder how the story plans to develop Willem and Chtholly’s relationship. Thankfully, this series doesn’t neglect their presence together and as each episode progresses, we learn more about the both of them. Character chemistry between Willem and Chtholly is also what I describe as charming that develops from friendship to romance. Willem also serves as a father figure for the younger Leprechauns. And in turn, the Leprechauns seems to grow really fond of him. This also brings a different side of the show as Willem realizes that the Leprechauns has a lack of fear. Because of this, the show makes it clear that Willem wants to avert any tragedy that can bestow on them. This goes to show how much Willem cares about the Leprechauns. It may also be possible that Willem doesn’t want history to repeat itself because of the way humans were wiped out. Regardless of how others treat him, he hopes to be a light of hope in this post-apocalyptic world.<br />
<br />
As a show with many species, you’ll often see characters that are far from ordinary. Besides Leprechauns, there are also trolls, goblins, and many other type of characters with animal traits. This also brings a racial issue into the show. It puts Willem into a compromising position at times as certain races does not like his presence in their world. (for their own personal reasons) However, what I do find interesting about this series is Willem’s main role. Does he play the role of a hero or someone that just wants to avoid tragedy again? It’s hard to judge entirely based on the characterization alone so in retrospect, the show leaves it more open ended for viewers to decide. <br />
<br />
Despite my initial impression of SukaSuka, I still find that the show suffers from several problems that holds itself back. First, the show really doesn’t avoid generic pitfalls you see in typical light novel adaptations. While the show has minimal fan service, it still has the cringe moments between Willem and various female characters. One particular trope (played out more as a joke) are the massages that attempts to make scenes sound much more lascivious than it appears to be. Not to mention, SukaSuka’s comedy feels really dry at times. It hardly make me laugh and although I realize the show isn’t built for that, it doesn’t even manage to ever draw a chuckle from me. Furthermore, I can’t really say the character relationship building outside of Willem/Chtholly to be worth mentioning. Oh and in terms of adaptation standards, the show does add some original content in attempt to make the story flow better. Does it really work out? That’s for me to know and you to find out.<br />
<br />
Taking a look at the animation, I have to admit that SukaSuka captured the atmospheric setting right along with its world fiction. Essentially, the atmospheric setting brings a spiritual feel. The character designs also has variety with the wide range of different hair styles and colors; with a credible reason too beyond just being decorative especially for the Leprechauns. The action is captivating and feels magical with getting its point across. While the series doesn’t have graphic violence, it does contain blood to show the dreadful feel of its story. The Beasts are also designed with a malevolent nature and some of them reminds me of Lovecraftian horror fiction. Character expressions is realistic and very human like with most of its characters.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is distinguishable with a combination of being melancholic, haunting, and cheerful. As I had expected, the theme songs are very moody with its choreography. The character voicing acting also connects well with their personalities in particular with Willem, Chtholly, and Grick. As most of the Leprechauns are quite young, stepping into the shoes of these characters is not easy. However, I am proud to say that the show captured their roles pretty damn well and make you connected to them.<br />
<br />
The tenderness of this show is what attracted me to watching this. I have to admit, SukaSuka has a sublime-like creativity with its world setting and story. I wasn’t too invested into the characters at first though over time, Willem and Chtholly’s relationship started to really grown to me. Still, like most light novel adaptations these days, SukaSuka falls into the trap of generic tropes. Furthermore, I don’t think this series is recommendable for anyone especially those that have less tolerance towards moody shows. I’d still give it a try though. It’s not a masterpiece but for a title that’s longer than 3 sentences, it does earn more attention than that.<br />

    This show is hard to talk about, because it&#039;s a sad story.  It&#039;s the story of how a promising show can be undermined by an unnecessary adherence to convention.  Oh, you thought I was talking about the plot of the show itself?<br />
<br />
Allow me to put this into perspective.  The Japanese light novel has a fair bit of history now, but allow me to be glib and say that they&#039;re a modern sort of pulp fiction.  Pulp fiction was a type of media engineered for popular entertainment.  It was printed in periodicals on cheap paper (the pulp in pulp fiction). 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247175">
        If you were to simplify all fiction into either, &quot;genre fiction,&quot; or &quot;serious literature,&quot; pulp fiction was all the way on the genre end of the scale.  The medium gave rise to some storytelling trends of its own, such as the two-fisted tale.  Much of the same can be said about the modern Japanese light novel.<br />
<br />
This show wears its light novel trappings on its sleeve.  This is apparent from the title alone.  It&#039;s entirely too long to remember, much less recite, inviting people to invent some marketing-friendly fan nickname.  It&#039;s set in another world.  There is exactly one guy in the main cast.  There are some vaguely-defined superpowers involved.  The main girl has long hair, at least past the mid-point of the back.  There are probably many more examples I could have listed here.<br />
<br />
Very little of this is obvious from the start of the show.  The first episode was so enjoyable and well-crafted that I paid these sorts of things no mind.  In retrospect, there were a few fears which had gathered, though I hadn&#039;t put words to them yet.  A good show draws you into its world, and lacks annoying distractions.  You aren&#039;t likely to think about this sort of thing during a good show.  However, the rest of the show wasn&#039;t up to the standard that first episode had set.  By the end of the fourth episode, I had put words to the fears, and found justification for them.<br />
<br />
The first concerns the plot.  This is one thing which isn&#039;t necessarily light-novel-ish, and seems to be more like one of Key/Visual Arts&#039; so-called &quot;utsuge,&quot; or &quot;crying games.&quot;  I disliked these sorts of stories for being emotionally manipulative.  They would unabashedly use cheap tricks to get you to feel sad.  Thus, the fear, &quot;Will they have these girls dying off one by one for cheap tears?&quot;  Now, a little tragedy isn&#039;t a bad thing.  However, the end of episode four was troubling.  Right after stirring the depths of main guy&#039;s trauma, main girl did a stupid anime rom-com thing and broke the tension.  Thus, at this point, I don&#039;t trust this show to handle tragedy appropriately.<br />
<br />
That isn&#039;t even the only problem I have with the plot.  Main guy&#039;s backstory is presented a bit out of order such that it induces a bit of a plot hole.  It made it clear that he was there to see the destruction of the surface world, yet also that this occurred about 200 years ago, long enough that his native language has become a dead language.  How this is possible wasn&#039;t made clear until later.  Even though we can accept the explanation via willing suspension of disbelief, since it&#039;s arguably necessary for the story to exist, there remains the question of why it was presented in this haphazard way.<br />
<br />
The setting has a bit of a similar issue, though it&#039;s more of a mixed bag.  The airborne cities are beautiful, and I&#039;m happy to set aside questions of how such things exist to admire them.  The fact that they&#039;re filled with the so-called, &quot;featured,&quot; humans with animal traits, or maybe sentient human-like animals, is also interesting.  This actually creates a bit of a problem, since the story only deals with these things superficially.  I want to see more of the world outside the orphanage-prison, but the plot isn&#039;t really interested in these things.  The plot really only cares about the fairy-girls.  The &quot;featured&quot; seem to only exist to isolate them, and to not-so-subtly encourage the viewer to empathize with them.  You see, this is a harem show.<br />
<br />
In fact, it&#039;s a themed harem.  The theme?  Lolis.  Yes, inner cynic, the orphanage-prison really is a lolicon paradise.  It was a totally gratuitous fanservice shot, of one of the younger girls, that verified this for me.  The presentation is a bit misleading in this (Black Bullet was a lot more transparent).  It&#039;s even possible this wasn&#039;t the author&#039;s intent, but it&#039;s what we got anyway.  Main girl is supposedly 15, which should be outside the lolicon range, but she&#039;s drawn like the object of a hebephile&#039;s wet dream anyway.  In some other show, I might have written this off as her being the flat one, but it&#039;s hard to interpret her any other way in this context.  There is a full-grown woman around, but she&#039;s treated like a joke by the narrative and as a nuisance by the main guy.  It&#039;s normal for a harem show to feature a character, the &quot;harem nanny,&quot; whose purpose is to manage the harem; this is literally her job.  She is a walking TV tropes entry.<br />
<br />
Several of the other characters are easily dismissed in this way.  Nephren is the nigh-emotionless girl.  Ithea is the gadfly.  Chtholly, a.k.a. main girl, is the tsundere.  Up until the end of episode four, I had a better opinion of her.  After that, it&#039;s clear that being a tsundere is her defining character trait.  It would be easy to declare main guy, a.k.a. Willem, to be the typical slightly moody light novel protagonist.  For once, this seems to be a bit unfair.  His broodiness stems from understandable guilt and unresolved grief, and he doesn&#039;t seem to project the typical too-cool-to-care nonsense that generally goes with the archetype.  Whether he&#039;s as overpowered as the typical escapist protagonist remains to be seen, but the fact that he&#039;s been defeated at least once, and even shown as mostly helpless in the scope of the narrative, makes it hard to compare him to the likes of Tatsuya Shiba.<br />
<br />
All in all, this show could have been something good.  This isn&#039;t mere speculation, as the first episode stands as testament to this potential.  It has aspects I like without reservation, such as the scenery porn and the soundtrack.  However, the medium of the source material, and the expectations associated with it, soiled it a bit.  There were too many annoying distractions to allow me to enjoy the good things.

    Tragedy... <br />
something that many know..... but a few would experience . Tragedy can happen with anyone anytime. They are impossible to avoid... they may be forgotten but they leave a deep scar too.... And the same happens here with willem (the protagonist) who has literally lost everything in his life..his family, friends and everyone he knew. But that isn&#039;t the end of it .. he didn&#039;t gave up hope... instead gave others the hope to survive for themselves and the ones they love.<br />
<br />
As  mentioned above.. story takes place 500 years after extinction of human race and the planet is now home to various other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246818">
        species of living beings... and Willem is the last surviving member of human race. He works at a warehouse for secret weapons... which are Lolis...and we then follow the tale of willem and cutholly (female protagonist) as they stuggle to survive and uncover the secret behind the &quot;Beasts&quot; who now rule the land.<br />
<br />
Anything about characters will be a spoiler so i am avoiding this section.<br />
<br />
The art is extremely beautiful and character design is pretty damm amazing. The op  and ed are extremely well done.... though its the scores and background music between the episodes which takes the cake.<br />

    SukaSuka is a post-apocalyptic fantasy anime that follows Wilhelm, a human that has been frozen for 500 years, who after being recovered finds out that humanity and the entire world has been decimated by some plant like beasts. He now lives with all the remaining races in some islands in the sky, and during one eventful day he conveniently meets a human looking girl and they spend the day with each other until it was time to depart home. After a few circumstances, mostly pertaining to his physical appearance, Wilhelm as tasked to take care of a certain place for the military which he accepts.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251272">
        When he gets there he is meet by a group of girls who live in an orphanage like building and it is revealed that they are fairies known as leprechauns who are the islands defence against the beast due to them being able to handle certain weapons that can fight against the beasts. <br />
<br />
The first part of the series mostly focuses on wilhelm taking care of the girls along with Nygglatho a human looking women despite being a troll. There are a plethora of girls in the show, but most of them are young and get very little focus except one who serves more as an example for the way leprechauns are. The main girls are Chtholly, Nephren, and Ithea, but the story mostly focuses on Chyholly and Wilhelm and how they build a mutual relationship over the course of the show. The show also does some decent world building, or at least better than most fantasy anime. Many fantasy races live within close proximity to each other(  a common staple in most fantasy anime), but for this show it’s not because they want to, but because they have to since the islands are the only safe places to be. Even then it doesn’t hold will as there are some scenes of racial tensions between races especially against disfeatured due to how human looking they were. Some bits of a city&#039;s culture were explored due to how one race was influential to it. the orgin of the islands and leprechauns are looked into and how they came into being.the mechanics of the dug weapons are neat as well. However in the end it’s at best decent since most of it is really skin deep due to the anime having to focus on the otherwise lackluster story. <br />
<br />
The story is lackluster since the anime is overtly melodramatic throughout it’s run time since it promises a tragedy at the end of its course and tries its best for the viewer to feel emotional in the end. The anime always tries to make sure of this with its focus on Chtholly, our tragic heroine of the show, as she has to undergo external internal mental struggles after her fight with the beasts. She was a decently written character, but it’s a shame how most of it will be discarded in order for the show to make her death more tragic. Along with her on the ride is Wilhelm who is also a decently written character as the show goes through his past as a “brave”, a group of generic heroes, and some of the things he’s done that lead to the present despite being gone for 500 years. He has a easy going and collected attitude, but underneath that demeanor is someone with regrets and pain, and will do anything to make Chtholly and the other girls happy. However other than them not many other characters are that well fleshed out despite some of them having some importance to the story.<br />
<br />
Production wise the show looks and sounds good. The art looks very standard as well as the character designs and setting. The animation was decent as well with mostly consistent quality throughout its run. Some notable parts for the art/animation are usually for the wings as well as Chtholly’s mind scenes, but the downside would be how dull the beasts look. The sound for the show is good as well with many of the voice acting fitting thier roles. The Ost for the show is also good mostly to fit the tone of the scene, but sometimes it’s allowed to be the only sound playing in order to set a certain atmosphere<br />
<br />
Overall there are alot of good things about this show when it comes to the production, and some of the ideas of the story. However the problem is what the story tries to focus on as well as how it tries to execute it. It’s a show that tries to present something well meaning and emotional, but fails to deliver.

    Start watching after, one&#039;s song? which you find on youtube randomly, and then decides to watch the show, and it was yet both a good and a bad idea.<br />
Because, watching the first episode of this song, I already figured out what, would be the end, &#039;&#039;my tears said it&#039;&#039;, but nothing can be known that it really will be.<br />
<br />
Very fit soulful romantic drama: a beautiful and tragic love story. The design of the characters is nice, there is a bit of fan service. The story tells about cute fairy girls who are doomed to a harsh fate to be a &quot;weapon&quot; in the world after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408794">
        the apocalypse. The plot for the drama is well developed. Despite the toughness, the title envelops its own tube atmosphere. One of main character Willem unusual guy saving everyone left and right, he has weaknesses (which makes him &quot;alive&quot;). He is a teacher from an orphanage with loli, the girls gradually become attached to him, and he to them, and he even falls in love with one. No less attention is paid to the main character Chtholly: a wonderful housekeeping girl, whom you gradually fall in love with, behaves like an older sister for the rest. With the appearance of Willem, she begins to experience the joy of life. Nygglatho is a troll in every sense, she is like a mother to the kids. Nephren is a cute kuudere kitten. Ithea will find something to surprise. The final kept in suspense until the end. Of the minuses - the series is not enough, because of which, after viewing, a certain understatement remains. <br />

Bonus- typing on my keyboard was wet from tears.<br />

    Sometimes an anime will come along that is obviously intent on tugging on your heartstrings. Sukasuka is another example of such anime. But man is it effective. <br />
<br />
While the show&#039;s rather predictable plot, based upon a more or less common premise might not seem all that interesting at first, the show uses what it has to it&#039;s full potential.The characters are given enough moments for the viewer to empathize with them. The cute albeit generic artwork coupled with a solid soundtrack, a lovable couple that you want to root for and likable side characters  are utilized to create powerful moments. <br />
<br />
The show oozes melancholy.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246827">
        I can&#039;t say that I &quot;enjoyed&quot; it but I will say that it&#039;s a compelling watch. <br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the dread of more to come.

    Despite the description, this anime isn&#039;t about a damaged man becoming a father figure to a bunch of cute, tragic little girls. It&#039;s about a forced romance between the adult male lead and a 15 year old main girl. It&#039;s masked as a father/daughter kind of relationship in the beginning, which only fuels my rage about it being turned into a romance that has the chemistry of drinking toothpaste with orange juice.<br />
<br />
What I assumed to be the core conflict of the series was the issue of using children as expendable weapons. In the end that didn&#039;t seem to be the case as the issue was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249696">
        solved in less than an episode, with the main character going &quot;don&#039;t do it&quot; and that&#039;s pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Then there was the conflict of the main girl leaving for battle. It was obvious from the start that they wouldn&#039;t kill her off there but the fact that she was brought back not only within the very same episode as the death fake-out, but RIGHT AFTER the main character gets the news of her possible death. Their inability to hold the suspense for at least a single damned episode is cheap to say the very least.<br />
<br />
Art style is beautiful and the world-building had potential, all wasted in a story that is unable to focus on the aspects that would have truly been interesting to see develop further. All in all the anime is an unfocused mess that could have been great, had it not been for the whole forced romance plotline.

    When a new anime season comes around; consumers of all tastes keep their eyes peeled for new fresh blood that can potentially have an impact on them and become a new favourite. As years have been going by it’s been getting harder and harder to spot potentially good shows as generic titles embracing the mediums current tropes are flooding the seasonal charts and no signs suggest this will stop anytime soon. So when something comes around with a premise that highlights potential, it’s understandable that people would get excited for it, especially if the source material has an existing fan base who are spreading around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255393">
        exhilaration for the adaptation. I am also one such consumer who looks out for potentially interesting shows that can stand out. I had my eyes peeled at an anime that I really thought could have been good. The production values were there, the premise was there, the potential was there. But as per normal with a lot of anime nowadays; the execution was not quite there. So this anime gets the honour of a review dedicated to how it missed the mark. And what is this special anime? Enter Sukasuka. A light novel adaptation that could have been good; except it wasn’t.<br />
<br />
Sukasuka had a nice set of ideas to become a good light novel adaptation. But the foundations weren’t set right; the characters being the first problem. With a multitude of characters introduced in the first few episodes, the show should have explored them all a little more thoroughly to bring its themes to life. Furthermore, some side characters introduced in the latter half of the show lacked any authenticity and served only as plot devices for information on the plot without playing active roles as proper characters that can serve the themes and story.  The setting also had a lot of potential for some exploration on issues such as child soldiers, war, conspiracy and potentially other themes relating to the situation that the anime presented. There were plenty of instances where some side characters had potential to be explored to support the larger narrative and the setting, but the show opted to go for a more passive take on fantasy conflict by attempting to depict a romance between the two protagonists which isn’t  necessarily a bad thing. It could have given it a unique edge against other anime in its genre that all rely on action as their main appeal to attract an audience, but it’s unfortunate that the romance between the protagonists was poorly illustrated.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 From the very first scene in the anime, the main male character Willem conveniently stumbles upon the main female character Chytolly and within an instant they go on a date together. From the beginning of the anime their relationship began on a forced note making it already feel unnatural as both characters fell for each other far too quickly and it could have benefitted the story more had the progression of their love felt natural and realistic. In effect, this makes the development between them not as engaging as it could have been and took away emotional value in later events. What also doesn’t help the case is Chytolly’s overabundance of emotional breakdowns which led to a lot of excessive melodrama that came off as unwarranted and annoying rather than genuine emotion that could also have made for some touching scenes if they weren’t excessive and had the romance being good enough for me to care. The only sort of silver lining the romance between the protagonists has is some of the quirky dialogue the two share that managed to at least put a little smile on my face and it was quite endearing to see, but overall it’s clear to see that the romance could have been portrayed with more care and its clumsiness is clearly visible.<br />
<br />
<br />
In contrast to the side characters, both of the protagonists as individual characters were fleshed out and developed. Each with their own dilemmas and this is the only worthy praise that I will give sukasuka excluding the audio-visuals. Chytolly’s and Willem’s traumas tied in with the central themes of the show and were also used as a way to reflect their progression to mutual love. As they got closer to conquering their ordeals, the more they fell in love with each other.  Also the subject matters of happiness, finding a place to call home, fighting for people you love and loosely family were all present as themes in sukasuka. They were all expanding upon and depicted thoroughly enough to make the backstories of the protagonists engaging. Its execution in this department was rather straight forward but satisfactory enough to get a pass mark. Everything the show aims to accomplish is brought together in a thematic sense and the relationship between the mains hits a surprisingly enjoyable and well produced emotional climax. But once again; its lack of care in the romance department hindered the emotional impact of the ending a little and it could have been far more emotionally gripping had the romance been depicted better. <br />
<br />
<br />
The setting itself is what showed the most potential in sukasuka out of all its features. World-building is of utmost importance in a fantasy anime. In a story that doesn’t take place in the world we know today, viewers have to be informed through the plot how the world works, how people in the world interact, the lore of the world and more. Sukasuka wasn’t completely devoid of world building. On the surface level it had established an interesting world that set the stage for a tragic story.  The tragic backstory of the protagonist Willem was also tied in with the lore of the world to provide some much needed synergy between the characters and the setting, especially in a show that was lacking any sort of connection between the world and its characters.  What ultimately let the show down in this department was not using the full potential that its setting provided. It set the stage for some potential theme exploration on controversial topics that would have made for an interesting experience. The group of children Willem has been tasked to care for are all ancient weapons fielded off to face the enemy and misleads the audience into thinking this would be a very important plot point for the anime, but due to the direction the anime took this plot point was sidelined. As a result the show spent time on cheaply telling the audience on the dilemmas faced by the children rather than showing many consequences as a result of them being used as weapons of war.   <br />
<br />
By far the best element of Sukasuka was the beautiful OST which was used to perfection. Placed in important and impactful scenes to heighten emotional impact and never overused to make the soundtrack feel redundant. Both the OP and ED were a pleasure to listen to and even work well as standalone listeners at any time. Alongside the audio the visuals also thrived. The show had a nice clear and neat colour palette that was exquisite to look at. The character designs were quite generic in appearance but were drawn neatly and attractive. Backgrounds were up to standard and the animation was quite good at times during some of the fight scenes.<br />
<br />
This anime certainly isn’t an outright calamity. Compare it to most anime that air today and it will look like a gem to recent catastrophes like Eromanga-sensei. The ideas were all there. Under the hands of a more competent and experienced writer the show could have flourished into a fine fantasy anime. Yet it never set the foundations well enough for all of its ideas to wholly blossom which is a shame considering the show did have good intentions. Under the rubble it still has some merits to take away, and it’s these positives that set this anime apart from the vast majority of light novel adaptations that are pumped out consistently every season. It is fully recommendable to hard core fantasy anime fans or just casual fans looking for an anime that offers some easily digestible entertainment. But it is instantly passible for experienced fans that are demanding more out of the medium than a simple romance story that isn’t competent enough to do a satisfying job and would turn out rather average for those people. Sukasuka is not a bad show. But it simply has far too many shortcomings to be considered a success story.<br />

    WorldEnd:What are doing at the end of the world?Are you busy?Will you save us? is quite a ride.  The title is long, but don&#039;t let it deter you from watching the anime.<br />
<br />
The story is really emotional as it goes along.  It simply starts out with Willem being the last human alive after the rest dies out from a fight 500 years ago.  He was apparently frozen, but that isn&#039;t shown in the show.  He meets Chtholly while she is visiting Earth and they have a wonderful day together as he takes her to everything she wanted to see.  He ends

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251237">
        up accepting a job as a technical officer for the military and he assigned to a floating island in the sky to care for a group of Leprechauns, whom are faeries who can use ancient Dug Weapons to drive away the Timere monsters that attack the lands.  The stuff that makes this show stand out is certainly the emotions and how the characters develop.  Even though he lost pretty much everything years ago, Willem quickly becomes accustomed to his new life as a care take for the children .  He rows along with the children every step of the way as he comes to realize the true nature of how they live their lives.  Chtholly takes a shrine to him pretty quickly as the two of them help each out in the roughest times and form a very touching relationship that demonstrates how much they are willing to do and sacrifice for each other.   The plot becomes a great story of tragic love as the two of them grow with each other, and other characters like Ithea and Nephren develop too.  Characters like Chtholly go through a lot of psychological trauma throughout the show and have to deal with part of themselves slipping away, in addition to dealing with other problems.  The ending is amazing and gives the show the tragic closure that you should expect to come. Overall, the story is very coherent and doesn&#039;t have all that many plot holes, but it does have a random episode in between that develops a character that&#039;s barely shown to be of any major importance later.  It easily gets a 8.5/10.<br />
<br />
The art is just great too.  It&#039;s  not necessarily a mongatari type of stand out art, but it&#039;s still great art.  No matter if it&#039;s the memorable character designs, the backgrounds, weapons designs (you probably won&#039;t recognize the difference between each weapon, but they do look different for other ancient weapons in shows), the blending of hair colors, or even the different take on wing designs.  Faeries always have wings of some kind, but the ones here look almost mosaic like with their design.  In short, the art is great and stands out.  A 9/10 is deserved.  <br />
<br />
The sound is amazing.  Every track complicated the scenes very nicely and they give off the feeling the show is meant to have.  The opening theme song is amazingly done.  The music is extremely pleasant to listen too and it sounds divine in a sense, and it&#039;s get across the tragedy and sadness that is everywhere throughout the anime and it has amazing visuals to go along with it.  This is technically an edit here for my my review since I wrote the review like 2 months or so ago from the date I&#039;m changing my ending thoughts on the music.  10/10 for music.  At the time I wrote the review, I think I was just looking for a way to take off a minor amount of points because I didn&#039;t feel like this was a 9.4/10 show, but after thinking a little, I realized that swapping my sound and enjoyment scores  expresses my thoughts more accurately.  <br />
<br />
The characters are great.  You really grow attached to them, especially Chtholly and Willem from a very point in the anime. Willem is basically the dad for all the Leprechauns he is in charge of, while Chtholly is more like their big sister.  Both of them have a lot more going on behind the scenes though and it starts to unravel as the plot goes forward.  Even Ithea and Nephren, and some of the younger faeries show personal growth along the way.  The story is filled with characters that just belong together.  Many of girls are examples of the cute girl on the outside, who has a lot of inner problems behind the scene and the way it&#039;s handled allows everyone else to grow alongside with the character experiencing trauma.  There are many characters that don&#039;t get much development, but they were younger side characters anyway.  Another 9/10 category.<br />
<br />
Now, I enjoyed this from start to finish and I never had a major feeling of dissatisfaction.  The ending cinches my enjoyment score since it is was so touching even though it was a tragic ending, but the show probably wouldn&#039;t be as good without the tragic closure.  My enjoyment earns a 9.5/10.  I recommend you watch this if you want to see some great character growth, great emotional and happy music, and all the good aspects of tragic love story all in one place.  I feel similarly about this show as I do about Angel Beats!, although, I enjoyed Angel Beats! slightly more but not enough to reflect it in my score since I&#039;m not going to give .6-.9 as a score( no 9.6 for example) since it&#039;ll make my overalls core look weird.  I recommend you  watch Angel Beats! after this if you like Worldend of course, since both have similar vibes and quality.<br />

    First of, this kind of story is not for everyone, the audience of this story is more to the &quot;mature&quot; audience one. Second this story more to slice of love, this tell you about how life, how happiness mean. If you expect an action, or cliche, fanservice or moe, you go in wrong show.<br />
This one story is one you called hidden gem<br />
Why it called &quot;hidden gem&quot; because only some people can understand the meaning of this story that&#039;s why it beautiful<br />
<br />
I just want to copy one of the quote of this show main theme song<br />
&quot; I don&#039;t know the meaning of life, but I know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251724">
        what&#039;s truly precious ~&quot;<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
This is probably the best mixing of romance, slice of life,tragedy story that I ever watched in my entirely life. It&#039;s tell of slice of life, happiness and love. About a man who already lost everything then gained again then lost again. About a woman who finally find her happiness on the short moment of her life. About a man and a woman who love each other but no matter what happen, they wont&#039; never be together. Even they lost their &quot;memories, even they lost all what they called themself and even on their &quot;empty shell&quot;, their feelings will always stay in their heart.<br />
<br />
The author/writer basically touch these two most important things on life :<br />
1. Memories<br />
2. A place where you called home/where you belong to<br />
<br />
And last thing, from episode 6 and onwards, this damn show trying to make you feel on every freaking episode<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
Art kinda feel off on some episodes but kinda paid off with the atmosphere they build. Well it&#039;s not like the anime from godlike studio, so it understandable. It still very good and still got the feeling<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
The music is making the anime more dramatic and tragic. The opening, ending and insert all dedicated for the main girl of the show. All the lyrics tell her feelings that she want to convey and story of how her struggle on her life, it describe her feelings and her story very well. Even the music is so sad and tragic. What&#039;s wrong with this show seriously?<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
Because this show is more to slice of life, the character development is expected to be strong on this kind of show. Yeah you will be see that, and it&#039;s too strong and sad the same time, every character have different perspective. The main character interaction is pure too. The main girl especially, it really hurt my heart where they can still and enjoy their life to the fullest on those cruel fate and become the &quot;happiest girl in the world&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
Though this kind of show is not suitable if you want some happy or cheering you mood after daily life of work/school, but I still enjoying the ride. This is one hell of emotion rides from start to end. If you love to read or have some hobby to read, try to see the LN, it have beautiful story, this kind of emotion ride is kinda rare to find on today era, so if you like this kind of genre too make sure to see it :)<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
I&#039;m glad I live long enough to see this hidden gem/rare show. Their tales, story, sorrow, tragedy and adventure will always in my heart :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    It&#039;s great!<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t quit to quickly, the anime needs some time to build the world.<br />
<br />
The Story is good, funny and BELIEVABLE! (Sorry but this is missing out in many animes)<br />
<br />
The Art is also without any visual flaws, it&#039;s not as outstanding as in other animes like Karneval but it fits the style of the series.<br />
<br />
The Sound is great!<br />
If you don&#039;t understand this you just have to listen to this: https://youtu.be/DJiMN7h50zs<br />
<br />
The Characters fit the world, with fewer mistakes (as a mistake I see if the character does something really untypical to them)<br />
<br />
I really enjoy this series and its definitely in my top 10 animes.<br />

    A masterpiece.<br />
It was a very complicated yet good anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I loved everything about it. Its story, art, characters. and the music. Man that ending song was so good. Scarborough Fair was a perfect match for that moment. It represents everything. Haven&#039;t read the LN but I think this adaption was decent for the LN. That cliffhanger though in the end got me. One of the only anime that made me emotional and actually made me cry. <br />
<br />
It is one of those anime that actually makes you think about life and the complex things of the anime itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amateur here hahaha

    Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? otherwise known as SukaSuka<br />
<br />
So let me begin by saying that I have completely put this anime on hold after watching the first episode of it around the time it came out in April/May.<br />
Reasons to that was the first episode was kinda not that interesting to me. About a guy with a mysterious past takes a job to look after a bunch of lolis (wow amazing right?). <br />
Nah what I mean is that, there were too many anime at the time coming out that were highly recommended that I simply couldn&#039;t care much of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266269">
        SukaSuka after that, however 7 months later I continued SukaSuka and I can honestly say that I am so on another level glad that I did (literally feels bad not giving it a go the first time). Well to my surprise SukaSuka was so flipping amazing!. If it wasn&#039;t for the opening scenes of the first episode which made me more than enough curious to come back to it, then this anime would have been long gone from me. <br />
<br />
From there were do I begin? The music? geez the music was absolutely breathtaking, which ended up hitting me so hard towards the end of the series. You get this truly wonderful love story that inspires and builds throughout the anime, culminating till the very end which is executed in such a way that may seem extremely desolating at the end but gives the viewer so much more to imagine and take in (FEELS). All carried beautifully by an truly stunning soundtrack that elevates this anime to another level. That is thanks to Scarborough Fair performed by Tamaru Yamada (Hits so hard on the emotions I tell you).<br />
<br />
The setting is a beautiful enigmatic world of numerous floating islands that are each home to small towns and are inhabited by animal humanoid-like people, to the dreaded surface that is filled with beasts being the reason why the races had to take it to the sky. The story behind this lies with what the humans had done centuries ago which in turn saw the demise of their race. There is no doubt a substantial amount of mystery throughout this anime and one watching would definitely consider that maybe they had missed a season or two before this, which is completely understandable. Yet this storytelling in this sense where the viewer is suddenly flug into the world is moderately rare. I am tired of anime series blatantly explaining the entire world in the first few episodes like an overly hyped New York times bestseller novel list of teen fantasy/sci-fi getting a Hollywood movie adaptation. This being a light novel the original creator had his hands in the adaption (Akira Kareno) so I fully trust that the 12 episodes is what was originally intended and hopefully a second season of this anime is on the horizon (please!).<br />
<br />
Little things I really liked was that Willem was not portrayed throughout the show as a badass overpower warrior, he had more meaningful ways in protecting his love ones. The fact that this MC doesn&#039;t take centre stage is very refreshing. The world and lore isn&#039;t forced on you like most anime, I like the fact that throughout it is talked upon here and there leaving more mystery for us to piece things together about the world. There is this equilibrium of the cute funny side of Willem and the girls, to the more seriousness side of the state of the world which you can see during the time Willem spends with the girls and the battles the girls face respectively. The love story is slightly forced but in an understandable way to Chtholly’s character being a young girl at that age where she is able to think for herself, especially after meeting someone (Willem) who she thought she will never see again. I mean there are so many other things that gets to me about this anime, that makes me want to come back to, especially the music.<br />
<br />
I can therefore say that SukaSuka has lowkey stolen my heart, has also made me reignite my love for anime. You know those endings that leaves you so empty as fuck BUT make you wish and wonder, that throws you in a room with your own interpretations and thoughts of what has happened and what will yet to come. Damn this anime made me laugh and most importantly cry so damn hard, that no anime has done for me to be completely honest.<br />
<br />
This is my first review and i am completely new to MAL, because of this anime I just had to make an account.<br />

    I just love the synonym name of the anime: Suka-Suka<br />
<br />
In my country, Suka-suka means like. It is a Bahasa Melayu language and a mother tongue for our citiziens. Google search it to know more.<br />
<br />
At First, I don’t plan to watch it, however the curiosity and the interest to watch this sparks in. Hence I decided to binge watch it for the first 4 episodes.<br />
<br />
And For that reason, I “suka suka” it, even though their title is quite long. <br />
<br />
The pace of the plot is slow but is understandable, because to me it doesn’t look like they rush the story, this is just based on my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246935">
        opinion since I didn’t read their light novels. I love the plot of this anime where the setting takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has long gone extinct with only one sole human survivor remaining and has gone to slumber icy sleep for 500 years, and woke up to a world where furry creatures, fairies, goblins and lizards and etc. exists.  He adopts the post-apocalyptic life very well, though not the first few days when he woke up.<br />
<br />
In addition, the first moments of the first episode show the foreshadowing of what is going to happen in the final few episodes that will be aired soon, pretty early indication there. Another addition, is the comedy skits and moe moments added in the anime so that it doesn’t make it look dark and gloomy series, just like 3 gatsu, the good thing is they don’t put too much moe otherwise.<br />
<br />
There is also romance setting in it, as Chtholly has romantic interest on Willem, I ship those two so bad till it sink. There were those moments when they show Chtholly and Willem scene, they’re really cute together, even in the first episode. I second this.<br />
<br />
Animation is amazing, artwork, character designs, background set up. I fancy this design, kudos to the drawing staffs who made the output of the anime pretty amazing. Studio Satelight is the studio in charge of this anime, and it already made few anime that I previously watched, one of it is Haruhi Suzumiya’s spin off which is based more on Nagato Yuki. Very decent studio, hopefully they wont fuck this anime up.<br />
<br />
The OP song and ED song are music to my ears, while the VA Selection are quite decent too, Willem voice actor is one of the highlights, with him still in debut year, he is doing quite well in his main role, hope he would get more main voice role in the upcoming future. Chtolly VA is one of the few VA I heard in the past anime, her roles are quite active and has decent and satisfying performance, overall most of the VA in it are very decent.<br />
<br />
I would recommend you guys to watch this anime, even though is more of drama, tragedy, romance genre type of setting, it has the slice of life feel to it too, and of course the fantasy since this takes place in the post-apocalyptic life, I’m sure you guys would love it.<br />
<br />
What do you do at the end of the world?<br />
Are you busy?<br />
Will you save us?<br />
Do you play Nintendo Switch?

    I usually don&#039;t watch seasonals, moreover reviewing it the instant right after completing it, but for this occasions. I just can&#039;t help to do it. Yes, that&#039;s how &quot;Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka?&quot; or SukaSuka has tempt me by its bewitching allure. People may meme about how studio Trigger saved anime with their originals such as Inferno Cop, Kill la Kill, and other shows. But this word comes genuinely from my heart, without any sense of irony, in which that, SukaSuka is the flawed savior of anime.<br />
<br />
Enter Willem Kmetsch, a human survivor from the world destruction. As he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252022">
        met Chtholly and worked as a carekeeper on her dormitory, he learned what does it takes to be a parent figure, and the importance of family itself.<br />
<br />
From the midst of superhero action anime and Light Novel adaptations with donkan overpowered protagonist which recently gets viral lately in terms of both popularity and quantity (or if I have to be more blunt, have plagued anime quality/is killing anime) yet I can never see much enjoyment or merit of them (such as Boku no Hero Academia, One Punch Man, and many other titles), experiencing SukaSuka is like finding a cure after being bit by 10 cobras. SukaSuka can be seen as a criticism for these types of anime but yet, it&#039;s still a really sincere work that doesn&#039;t come as being pompous on its criticism. It subverted the fundamental tropes of them. As much as I see the heroism theme portrayed in Boku no Hero Academia or being a donkan is the way to get girls attention are a total hypocrisy and delusional, I saw that the theme about heroism portrayed in SukaSuka as the most mature portrayal of it so far. The setting of SukaSuka is nothing new, but the implementations of it&#039;s core themes towards this kind of settings is what makes SukaSuka unique. I also found that this theme about family is rather barely explored in most anime so this is also where you can enjoy your stay for it.<br />
<br />
Our protagonist Willem, who now lives in a sky continent in a post-apocalyptic setting, begins like no more than your typical Light Novel self insert character. However, throughout the series, it&#039;s proven that despite being slightly dense, he never went full donkan that it makes his personality more believable. Despite also being quite overpowered to some extent, Willem has a worn-out bodies that limits him for being a Gary Stu and throughout the series, we can see on how his inner conflicts due to his undying fighting spirit in order to be a hero that fight against the beasts to protect the people. Or is it what it means to be a hero? Can it also mean about something else which is more trivial to be protected? Willem can be distinguished from your typical hero by his limitations in conjunction on the redefinition of what does it meant to be a hero.<br />
<br />
The heroine, Chtholly Nota Seniorious, is a mysterious 15 year old Leprechaun whom little is known about her past until the series went further. Leprechauns are the continents trump card in their battle against the beasts, and they are trained in order to have no fear of death. However, due to their appearance that resembles those of humans, whom are thought to be the one responsible for the world destruction, they are being shunned by the common society and regarded as being &quot;featureless&quot;. At the first few minutes of the anime, Willem saved Chtholly from slipping and being the object of hate by the mass, and then took her stroll together with him. After they lives together and he taught many thing Chtholly never feel before due to her lifestyle, she began to question whether all the &quot;fighting with bravery&quot; mindset which had been planted on her since her birth was really the way of living on its truest. Her quirks really shown in a detailed manner, more than even the protagonist, which makes the watcher attached to her all along to her, for a very nice reasons.<br />
<br />
To be frank, the romantic relationship between the two main characters sprouts too fast. But once it sprouts, it develops in an excellent pace. The bashful nature of both parties, yet knowing that they do love each other can never fails to made me smile. Unlike many other romance I have experienced, SukaSuka gives both views towards the other, which is something important in order to make a good romance since I believe that romance is a double sided relationship and portrayal of just a single party will make the other party an object instead. SukaSuka knew this well and avoided it.<br />
<br />
Portrayal of humans on SukaSuka are very evil. It&#039;s believable on how the settings took place most likely on the far future where humans might got overboard with their greediness and exploitation. It serves as a contemplation for the watchers on what have we become so far, did we have turned to be nice to the mother earth or is it the opposite? Does all experiments make the world a better place? Homo homini lupus, and this actually fits really well after you learn some truth regarding the plot point. Of course, like other works which has living biological weapon plot point, it also portray on how it&#039;s unethical on the usage of it or I can say that war in general is a futility.<br />
<br />
Unlike most popular post-apocalyptic anime nowadays, the focus of SukaSuka isn&#039;t the action, but rather the family themed character drama instead, but it still realized that the characters are in a life and death situations without abusing many fight scenes. Balancing such a lighthearted tone with a darker one is hard, but it still manages to can have a mostly light tone without forgetting the situation they&#039;re in. More good news, this tone blends well with the core theme of he show.SukaSuka have an ok worldbuilding, in which starts out delivering few expositions towards the world they lived in, and manages to give a slow but steady and sufficient amount of it as the series progress. A lot of information still being missing however, but I can comprehend that since it only adapts about half of the Light Novel. It explained why the people took refuge on the sky island, how it was made, about the war against the beast in depth, and so on that the essential information make the watchers can follow the story easily. Sometimes, bombing the watchers with a lot of expositions is obnoxious, especially if done by monologues but none of them happens in SukaSuka and it feels natural. One other thing worth mention is that SukaSuka is feminist friendly, as how the Leprechauns done most of the fights while Willem being a nurturing figure for the Leprechauns. It also added by the fact Scarborough Fair was sung by a female singer, but use the masculine lyrics that modifies female third person into the male ones. Scarborough Fair also blends perfectly with the medieval esque settings of the Sky Island, to add up for the overall quality.<br />
<br />
Despite my praise, SukaSuka have a considerable amount of flaws too. The theme presentation is kind of childish for the earlier episodes and the type of comedy doesn&#039;t fit with the show settings, as most of them are more befitting to a school harem anime. The visuals is quite nice but can be improved in a lot of ways, especially the characters expressions most of the time. Lastly, due to the amount of focus to the main character, almost all of the side characters fell flat out one-dimensional which is barely memorable, although those who like characters with said personality might remember them very well. Aware with all these flaws, I still think that the pros really outweighs the cons.<br />
<br />
SukaSuka gets better over time and the ending made me overflowed with feels towards it. The slow motion scene power was also backed up with the song which have been tuned at the first episode. How the ambience, melody, and the lyrics can&#039;t fit any better to the situation they&#039;re on the ending is outstandingly scary. Trust me, even when the buildup from the prior episodes don&#039;t affect you that much, the ending is still golden, despite its predictability. The execution of cinematography went all out on the ending, especially that scene which is more than a satisfactory for me that usually don&#039;t feel for a melodrama. If such scene isn&#039;t emotionally engaging at the slightest, then I don&#039;t think emotionally engaging anime moments existed.<br />
<br />
SukaSuka is one of the best beverages for the pacifist soul like me, and it has become one of my most enjoyable anime so far, if not the most. It also restored my faith to seasonal anime and become my medicine for generic action anime nowadays. The accurate depiction and thought provoking message about what does it take to be a human, heroism for the adults, family, valuing the present over the past or a vague future, living one&#039;s own life to its fullest, and the delicate wrappings of all these mature themes into such story is what enchant me to this Light Novel adaptation. SukaSuka might not the savior the community deserves, but SukaSuka is the savior that the community needs.

    The setup of this is the cutesy/anime version of Kazuo Ishiguro&#039;s book/movie &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;. Right from the start we have their moral dilemma; a few young people&#039;s deaths are perpetually necessary to protect the lives of the many. I don&#039;t know why this isn&#039;t mentioned more in the synopsis, it might have bagged a bigger adult viewership when you can only really see some cutesy pics and very limited info. I am enjoying it for this so far but it is a very large subjective matter to deal with. I hope they handle it carefully. It could easily degenerate into a &quot;save them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247295">
        and everything will be okay&quot; scenario which would make the original dilemma invalid.<br />
<br />
The main trouble with the show is the motivation of the characters; their actions often don&#039;t make sense. There can often be no reason for their actions other than what the story needs to happen. Or, scenarios that seem important are ignored the whole epsiode. These things happen especially in episode 5.

    World End (aka SukaSuka) is not a bad show but it is a very unbalanced one.  It has it&#039;s good moments in front and back ends, but crammed in the middle is a lot of forgettable plot and characters.  Outside of the the leads, Wilhelm and Ctholly, I struggled to really even recall the names of the other characters.  While there are some interesting moments with the side characters, most notably Ithea, I mostly remember the characters by either their stereotypical trope and/or hair color.<br />
<br />
The world the show has created is really fascinating and has a lot of potential.  It also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251368">
        has some great artwork and character designs.  But all that is wasted.  There are several episodes that are very much almost entirely filler and in a short 12 episode show, there is not much time to tell the narrative.  A lot of the fascinating parts of the story too, Wilhelm&#039;s and Ctholly&#039;s pasts are only very casually explored.  <br />
<br />
I understand that is that this show is ostensibly a romance set in a fantasy environment but I cannot for the life of me even recall why they have feelings for one another short of Wilhelm&#039;s almost pathological need to save someone and Ctholly for the first time seeing that there may be a reason to fear death because she wants to has things she wants to cherish.  Oh and then there is the awkward, completely-out-of-place orgasm scene.<br />
<br />
The strength&#039;s of this show really is it&#039;s artwork and if you want to see some great visuals, this is a good one.  It also has a pretty good, albeit unresolved ending that finally delivers on some of the action that&#039;s teased in the beginning of the show and surprisingly neglected for the majority of the run.<br />
<br />
Overall the show is decent, but is ultimately very forgettable.  Having just finished the show during its original run, I am struggling to remember much of what occurred in the show.  If you&#039;re looking for a better told story with romance and fantasy elements, I&#039;d recommend Re: Zero or Snow White with the Red Hair over this show.

    Well, I guess this story is not for everyone. I read the LN and part of the sequel and now I watch the anime. At the start, I will write, when I read the LN, it hurts me, but I was not able to stop because the characters and story were really good. Anime is a really good adaptation for this LN.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
<br />
From episode 1 you can guess in what direction this anime will be going. This is not your typical fighting or happily ever after anime. This anime focus more on way of thinking. How beastman people see this little girls as weapons and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249241">
        they don´t care if they lose their life or not. How our MC sees this little girls different, because of his past and his feelings or how Nygglatho have a different point of view on the whole situation. It is a story about a promise, fear, desire to love and to be loved. <br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
<br />
Well, there are some truly amazing scenes. But sometimes you see that there was probably not enough of budget.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
<br />
I guess that everyone who watch this anime understand. Music is used simply perfect and it fits really well. For example, Scarborough Fair version was outstanding.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10<br />
<br />
Willem, Kutori, Nygglatho, girls, I think it is really hard to don´t like them. They offer you a different point of view on the whole situation. Also Kutori x Willem interaction is in my opinion really nicely done. Also, Willem x girls´ interaction or Willem x Ren interaction is truly cute.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoy the story. Don´t expect a fighting anime or some fan-service. This anime is simply focused on feelings. Love, fear, tragedy and more, you will find them all.
