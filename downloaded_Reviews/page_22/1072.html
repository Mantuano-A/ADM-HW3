    A total score of 5 may seem hard on Nanatsu no Taizai: Imashime no Fukkatsu (The Seven Deadly Sins: Revival of the 10 commandments or simply The Sins S2). Especially according to its high score. But I´m disappointed. I really enjoyed the first season and was glad when I read that a season 2 were coming, and with 24-episodes at that. But my excitement was steadily replaced with disappointment and uninterest. My review will contain minor spoilers to specify why I had problems with this sequel, but they will be heads ups for those (₴).<br />
<br />
The biggest let down with The Sins S2 for me was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282584">
        the story and character developments. With that I mean a very uninspired story direction and an almost non-existing character development. What I truly loved about the prequel was the goofy but adventures story, filled with small surprises of meaningful meetings and overdramatic but interesting character interactions. I even didn´t care about Meliodas repetitively grouping of Elizabeth. Some shounen tropes were of course present, but it had its own style, feeling and inventiveness. The battles and fights made sense, they had drive and feeling in them, and some were really nice to look at. The mystic and allure of the sins and their past was thick, and some strong friendships and relationships were formed. <br />
<br />
And then S2 happened. The far from straight but entertaining story path took a straight battle shounen path, becoming randomly magic/power level face offs, and character interaction became either repetitive, cliché shounen troopy or melodramatic. Let me give you an example, spoiler alert is on ₴. The battles changes from being about enemies facing off each other in creative ways with emotional investment, to be about magic and power levels, tournaments and powerups. Spoiler alert off. Why taking that direction? If this is a faithful adaptation, I think Nakaba Suzuki (the author and artist behind the manga), abandoned the good adventures concept he had established in the first half, for washed out Dragon Ball power level bs. I´m sorry but it is really how I feel. <br />
<br />
Let me elaborate. You know the classic battle scene with the top bad asses, where you have proper build ups to get really emotionally invested in it? Well, don´t expect them here. The new threat appears, and in the beginning the whole thing had much potential. A demon clan has been freed (by Hendrickson in the end of the last season), and Meliodas seems to be connected to them. Many potential interesting meetings between the Sins and the Demon clan members, or plot/character developments/interaction as well as background stories. But most of it turned out to be pretty basic shounen trope encounters, with cliché battle speeches and brawly screams of their attacks with cool names such as “Death Breath” and wired mid fight power ups.  <br />
<br />
I really wanted to like this sequel. I was absolutely a bit enchanted by the prequel - the magical world with all its different inhabitants and magical functions was very enjoyable. I lost that feeling in S2. A few things are easy to pin point out, as the depletion of the story as well as the amount of new characters. In S2 the numbers of characters keep bashing in, diffusing the time and space from a lot of key characters. Some characters like Jericho got some nice development and time even if her Ban fixation could become a bit embarrassing. Ban gets more time as well (his background mini arc was one of the best parts of the show for me), Diane gets a solid number of episodes focused on her, and Meliodas is Meliodas so time has been spared for him as well. The rest? Is mostly neglected for new characters. Elizabeth? Gets less development than both Sakura and Orihime put together.<br />
<br />
It felt like the narrative both speed up and slowed down at the same time. The scenes took 1s or 10 episodes. Most things happened to fast or to slow. A crashing battle there, and suddenly is guy 1, 2, 3, 4 and girl 1, 2 in a completely different geographical location, training and unlocking powers to left and right for episodes, for them to next split up and be in like 6 different places, to end up little randomly together at a third place later on. The reasons behind it? Weak at best, and mostly poorly explained. I lost interest in who the demon clan members were and ₴ how in hell they can remember things from 3000 years ago so clearly. I lost interest in the powerups, I lost interest in Ban´s and Elaine’s relationship, and I lost interest in Meliodas grouping of Elizabeth. <br />
<br />
And here I think we are reaching the shows main problem. I just lost interest, in my eyes it didn´t carry this “new” direction well. It crumbled away along known and common battle shounen paths and ruining the atmosphere it built up to that point. The new stereotypical shounen approach just didn´t work well for me. <br />
<br />
The Sins S2 is as its prequel an A-1 Picture production. If your familiar with the studio, think A-1 on a good day there they are putting some in some effort and money in their creation. The style is simplistic but characteristic, and as most A-1 productions, with some nice colourful backgrounds and with curvy ladies and muscly men. And since A-1 actually put in some effort in it, the animation is more than decent, with some intense battle scenes as the one between Meliodas and Ten Commandments or Escanors swift encounter with the demon Galand. <br />
<br />
One of the highlights of the prequel was the solid rock-fantasy inspired soundtrack, which was affect full and well composed. Which they luckily stuck to this time around as well. No complains there. <br />
<br />
So, to summon things up, The Sins S2 didn´t get the job done in my eyes and ears, even if I have no complaints against A-1´s accomplishment. I can see why many still love the show, but the magical spell that The Sins S1 had put on me was utterly crushed. Generic battle shounen can absolutely work, but this direction felt cheap, especially since Nakaba Suzuki had established a very magical world which could been focused on instead of long ego speeches on who´s the toughest, strongest, and most powerful fighter. #disappointedatthemediocracy  <br />

    Stop me if you’ve heard this one before but it seems that battle shounen anime in recent years have been on the decline. Boku Hero no Academia became a big name that is able to carry itself but beyond that, there’s hardly any other that made a name for itself. Well, there’s Black Clover but that abomination is an example of giving battle shounen a bad name in recent years. Boruto has been an underwhelming sequel that looked more like a cheap cash grab for the franchise. Where does a show like Nanatsu no Taizai still stand?<br />
<br />
To be fair, the series already established itself from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282556">
        some of its other projects like the first season, OVAs, and movie. It isn’t as long as some other shounen like Naruto, Bleach, or One Piece. In fact, it’s not even part of the “Big 3” as Westerners would call it. However, Nanatsu no Taizai does make a name for itself by developing its own ideas. The first season established the principle cast and felt more like a way to get viewers familiar with the story. In this sequel, the business really picks up as new dangers are unleashed into the world.<br />
<br />
For those who don’t remember, the story picks up right after the first season as Hendrickson breaks the seal on the Coffin of Eternal Darkness. By doing so, he unleashes a group of powerful demons known as the “Ten Commandments”. Essentially, they are the central antagonists of this season. While we don’t know too much about them, it’s known that they hold a deep grudge against Meliodas for betraying them in the past. The first few episodes establishes their testament in power as one of their members is able to make Meliodas look like a jobber in a one-sided fight. This implies that the Ten Commandments are more powerful than anything Meliodas and his friends ever dealt with. In terms of characteristics, the Ten Commandments are known for their unique “Commandment” power and various personalities. For new viewers, you may be surprised at how much personality these beings show for their characters. It’s actually somewhat human for characters like Galand’s arrogance, Fraudrin’s manipulative nature, or Monspeet’s politeness. Unfortunately, there’s not much concrete characterization for the Commandments. I blame this mostly on the pacing because the manga explores much more about their past and roles.  <br />
<br />
There’s actually two sides of the coin regarding the pacing of the show. On the surface, it is indeed slow and some elements of the plot can really be condensed. I actually felt impatient after seeing the season focus so much on characters like Diane and Ban. The latter is actually more important but really should of been shorter than shown on TV. In addition, Meliodas’ past is explored only enough to give viewers an impression of who he is. In essence, it isn’t enough to show the more important side of his role as a “betrayer” to the Commandments. In addition, anime only viewers will probably question what it really means when certain characters call him a “demon” and “former leader”. The other side to look at is how faithful the anime adaptation is. Most chapters cover literally everything from the book with many chapters on a panel-by-panel basis. It’s loyal to the manga readers that really bought the show into what it is. Nothing is changed for fans of the manga especially those who are looking forward to certain scenes to be adapted.<br />
<br />
Despite the season focusing on the conflict with the Commandments, new characters are also introduced from the good guy’s side. The most noticeable character is Escanor, the seventh and final member of the Seven Deadly Sins. He makes a hell of an impression that will make viewers hunger for more of his role this season. Other important support characters also make returns that may surprise you. <br />
<br />
A-1 Pictures once again uses their resources to adapt this sequel although it actually impressed me for their work. There are certain episodes that really stood out that includes Escanor’s character debut, Meliodas’ confrontation with the Ten Commandments, and Galand’s rampage. Animation quality remains similar to the previous season although A-1 Pictures still falls into the occasional trap of awkward character models. There are also some scenes that didn’t feel as impactful as those in the manga especially in terms of character expressions. However, the battle scenes lived up to its expectations. This especially applies to climatic battles in the latter half of the show that also brings credibility of character power levels. <br />
<br />
The music and OST is still composed by Hiroyuki Sawano although I’m a bit disappointed that most of it is just a rehash of the previous season’s. The new theme songs also sounds less impactful. Despite that, I think character voice mannerism should be given praise especially for the Ten Commandments. Yuki Kaji is able to voice two characters with very contrasting personalities. Others such as Escanor makes their personality stand out much more thanks to the modern talent of Tomokazu Sugita. <br />
<br />
Nanatsu no Taizai: Revival of the Commandments is a battle shounen that is faithful but perhaps a bit too much for its own good. This series suffered from some pacing issues that I feel like some viewers will not easily forgive. Plus, some of the new characters didn’t really get the amount of charaterization it deserves. However, I would like to say to give this sequel a chance. It’s still part of the franchise that is committed to its ideas and continues to develop the main story as it’s intended. I just hope that when the next inevitable season comes, we get a real showstopper.

    The bad part about expecting a show to be good, is that you end up hating it even if it&#039;s ok-ish. That&#039;s what happened to me after watching Nanatsu no Taizai: Imashime no Fukkatsu, I thought it was gonna be good, very good.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know about you guys but what I care about most in Anime, Movies or Tv series, is the dramatic structure, the characters and the dialogues. <br />
<br />
The dramatic structure sucks, a lot of back stories and cheesy drama.<br />
I couldn&#039;t stand the dialogues. They were so dry and predictable.<br />
Nanatsu no Taizai&#039;s characters have never been good in my opinion, Ban is always mad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291769">
        and angry, Diane is a crybaby, cute wannabe, Eli is so annoying. This show has one of the worst cast ever.<br />
<br />
The Art style and the fights kinda saved the Animé from being a disaster.

    In my opinion, this anime series is particularly overrated by the anime community. <br />
What appears to be an anime with decent visuals, sound and budget simply disappoints in the story and character segment. <br />
<br />
The art, animation and sounds are no doubt well made, and this has blinded us to the fact that following the story is simply frustrating. <br />
<br />
First of all, there is no real price to pay for our heroes, no such thing as punishment for when the main cast loses. <br />
<br />
In one of the early episodes of this season, we are shown that most of the main characters get brutally (and fatally) injured,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273565">
        but actually we have seen that happen multiple times in season 1 already. Lo and behold, the characters aren&#039;t even hurt, just got off with a scratch. Viewers have already been conditioned to not feel shock or suspense when something terrible happens to the cast: Meliodas has regrown lost limbs, dear Elizabeth has revived everyone in the final episode of season 1 before, surely it can happen again when the MCs are all dead. <br />
<br />
Also, the story is riddled with annoying subplots that diverge from the main plotline: the revival of the demon clan.<br />
<br />
Gowther decides to screw with the crew&#039;s memory, and they have a pointless internal fight (they still let gowther travel with them, and gowther still doesnt know what he did wrong).<br />
<br />
The fcking giant loses her memory for the second time, disrupts the crew from focusing on the demon clan.<br />
<br />
Ban leaves the 7 sins so he can continue to mire himself in his dead lover (yes this subplot is still ongoing from the last season). <br />
<br />
And Merlin has stolen Meliodas&#039; power so now they have to first embark on a side quest to get it back. <br />
<br />
While subplots are necessary to pave the way for the final fight, the above plotlines seem to have little to nothing to do with the revival of the demon clan. The demon clan don&#039;t play a role in these subplots at all, and somehow steers clear of them so that our little heroes can level up peacefully. <br />
<br />
Also, the fucking pig is annoying, especially with its deal with the power level. The storytelling is crap when they have to rely on numbers to help us rank who is stronger than who.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is an anime that disappoints and that betrays our expectation of what is termed a &#039;well-made&#039; series. There have been many &#039;well-funded&#039; shounen series like this one (such as Magi and BnHA), but we should not simply believe that it is a good anime just because it has made itself to appear to have more potential than it credits itself with.

    The sequel I desired, but not the sequel I expected it to be.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the show starts off with a big thump, direct continuation from the first season. As strongly and unexpectable it could be, the rest of the show didn&#039;t follow the tempo.<br />
<br />
At the start we are getting familar with an old-new, even greater threat than before. To be honest I felt like it was the most generic way the show could possibly go and further on I realized I was right.<br />
Post-intro part gets only slower and slower while implementing stuff which doesn&#039;t feel that important for the main plot.<br />
A LOT clichés for fantasy-supernatural

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282653">
        anime world has been used, not many explanations that I wanted and some that looked like a filler... Well I feel like vast part of this season was one big filler.<br />
Getting to the point, I didn&#039;t notice much of the story development (possible spoiler here: show ends in like half of what it wanted to tell!), not much of the character development (well, it tries to tell us about one thing, it tells but then it repeats it over and over in next episodes).<br />
As long as the story is not doing its best, it can be still quite enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Getting to the art, I don&#039;t know if the previous season was similar, but I noticed quite a few scenes here and there that were literally boring which lead my attention to focus on the art and what I noticed was poverty... It&#039;s understandable to make some cuts on the less important moments or backgrounds, while focusing on the first plan, but... Literally when making some &#039;fill in&#039; dialogue, scene is one and long frame, with almost none movement, probably they expected to cover it with some nudity.<br />
I would say that it&#039;s fair most of the time with some really awful moments.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not really good with rating sounds, so I&#039;m gonna say that it&#039;s avarage with some good tracks and openings.<br />
<br />
Character development feels poor, focusing on few and neglecting all the rest, not much to say without a spoilers, but I didn&#039;t learn many new things about most of the cast.  Good example of decent character introduction, but poor development (that was present all the time) is Escanor - such potential, mysterious and undiscovered character has been revealed with flat backstory, well, atleast his behaviour was interesting, but not much time was invested in that.<br />
<br />
Coming to the end, show is fine, enjoyable but it got noticable flaws, that make it taste like an undercooked pork.

    First impressions of Nanatsu no Taizai: Imashime no Fukkatsu<br />
<br />
<br />
With much delay, I finally conclude the first impressions of Nanatsu no Taizai: Imashime no Fukkatsu, a series that I am following this winter season, which is already quite advanced.<br />
<br />
Nanatsu no Taizai: Imashime no Fukkatsu or &quot;The Resurrection of the Commandments&quot; is the sequel to the anime based on the original Nakaba Suzuki manga set in medieval Britain and partly inspired by the Legend of King Arthur. And I say partially, because although Arthur Pendragon is part of the story, those who have read the manga or watched the anime, know that he is not the protagonist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273359">
        ... despite the recent events of the manga.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I did not do a review of Nanatsu no Taizai at the time, but it is worth saying that despite its fanservice and its apparent superficiality, I consider it a good Shonen of Battles. Its protagonist Meliodas is of the type of characters that from the beginning is too powerful, but what makes him interesting is his personality. Although he appears to be a relaxed and somewhat perverted guy, in fact he is much deeper. His past is a great mystery in the first season, as well as the origin of his power and everything is to be revealed in this new series.<br />
<br />
That said, although the anime was entertaining, its production values ​​were not really high. The animation was not particularly bright and the adaptation is correct, without even matching the overall quality of the manga. However, just like the manga, in its second half, this first series improved a lot in its rhythm and ended quite epically. At the time of closing that season we already knew 6 of the 7 Capital Sins. Meliodas the Sin of Anger, Diane the Sin of Envy, Ban the Sin of Greed, King the Sin of Sloth, Gowther the Sin of Lust and finally Merlin, the Sin of Gluttony.<br />
<br />
We have one to know, and boy do I want to see that. But let&#039;s move on to the important thing.<br />
<br />
How is Nanatsu no Taizai: Imashime no Fukkatsu?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are a lover of the Shonen of Battles, this series is a mandatory stop. Having seen the first episodes, I must say that the series continues to be quite common in terms of its technical quality. It is not a series that surprised by its animation. However, its quality remains fairly consistent with respect to last season.<br />
<br />
Takeshi Furuta replaces Tensai Okumura and Tomokazu Tokoro as director for A-1 Pictures. Takao Yoshioka takes on the job of adapting the original Suzuki script. Keigo Sasaki continues on board in the character design, and fortunately, Hiroyuki Sawano is still involved with the soundtrack, along with Takafumi Wada. Kohta Yamamoto also joins them.<br />
<br />
The first episode picks up where it left us, Signs of a Holy War, the four-episode special that followed the original television anime. Princess Elizabeth of Liones has a dream in which she sees Meliodas face some shadows, but everything seems to go in peace. There is a ceremony where the Seven Sins are decorated, or at least the 4 that are present (Ban and King left before the ceremony). It is there where we get introduced to a new element in the anime that will be very familiar to fans of Dragon Ball: the power levels.<br />
<br />
Yes, Nanatsu no Taizai has power measurements. The system is simple, each character has a number of power that is extracted from the sum of the magical power, physical power and spirit or will power. Hawk will be in charge of giving us those numbers so that we have clear who is who in this world.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this is simple from the plot point of view: it is to put fear in the body. Basically, this was the simplest way Nakaba Suzuki found to help us establish a hierarchy, now that the Ten Commandments are the new threat.<br />
<br />
In any case, both in the manga and in the anime there is a certain coherence with this theme and the inevitable powerups of the protagonists are justified. In some cases because in fact his real power was greater than that known until now and in others with training, as usual.<br />
<br />
Finally, a detail. The opening, a collaboration between FLOW and GRANRODEO titled Howling, is in fact quite disappointing. Considering the previous work of both groups, the only thing that could be expected was a historical opening and in fact it left me quite cold. It&#039;s not a bad song, do not get me wrong, but it could have been better. In addition, the video does not favor it, too mediocre and unimaginative. It is a pity.

    There aren&#039;t great many things that make Nanatsu no Taizai a good anime or even worth of watching. There still are some, and I have personally been able to enjoy this season --or at least most of it-- better than I ever thought was possible.<br />
<br />
The main characters are not among these reasons. Our mc is pretty much the most boring and uninteresting shonen lead there has ever been. On the other hand, he is also so bland and empty character that he isn&#039;t very annoying either. Outside the fact that he is voiced by the same guy who did the main lead in Guilty Crown

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282555">
        which is always a minus. Elizabeth brings exactly as much to this series as Orihime did to Bleach. Pretty much all the rest are so forgettable that I had to spend 30 minutes reading FAQ&#039;s before even starting this season just to get some sort of recollection of who is who... only to see that it literally does not matter if you don&#039;t know who anyone is. Practically anyone can be criticized with more words than they can be praised with. The series is amazing like that. <br />
<br />
The story certainly does not make this series worth of a watch for anyone. Or if it does, then I surely am not among these fellas who watch this series for its story. One could say the story makes it hard to enjoy even (especially during the 2nd half of this season), but it doesn&#039;t require all that much effort to look past most of its problems. If you have the tendency to pinpoint flaws and count how many times a series aimed for 13 years-old youngsters chooses the most obvious outcome, then this show most likely is not for you no matter what I will say few paragraphs after this one. Smart choices have still been made here in terms of writing. For one, the series doesn&#039;t constantly rely on powerups, asspulls nor friends who come to save the day on the very last second. Even &quot;the best anime ever&quot;, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, did this constantly. In fact, being a cliche shonen story, Nanatsu no Tanzai has abandon surprisingly many of the common cliches and tropes. Few of the romantic subplots and the heart-warming conclusions to drama are actually pretty well-written, and the show can be praised for how well it succeeds in terms of the given drama and past stories.<br />
<br />
The art, sounds and overall production of this series are not the reason -- or even close to the reason -- why I considered this to be entertaining. In fact, the art is often eye-catchingly bad. Especially the character design on most of our main dudeouses seem to be the visual representations of their uninteresting personalities. The animated mouth movements seem the worse the more you pay attention to it. It&#039;s hard to unsee once you do. The OST is nonexistent, but during some of the drama moments, makes the series seem better than it is. Powerful, good songs right there. Otherwise the OST rarely serves the series, but on the other hand, it is fairly original and has practically no similarities with tracks commonly heard in FTS series. This is, at the very least, worth of noting. Now that all the reasons on why this show is not the best thing ever are over with, let&#039;s talk about why I was able to enjoy it: Let&#039;s talk about two amazing characters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apologize to me that you were born into this world.&quot;<br />
<br />
The not-even-a-bit-arrogant Escanor is the epitome of 3 things: badass, manly and bro. This fella is the manliest character I have seen in anime since the muscular, mute and shirtless Freddie Mercury seen in the anime &#039;Cromartie&#039;. Escanor speaks, has manlier mustache and occasionally even wears a shirt. Are you part of the Armstrong cult from Full Metal Alchemist? I have good news for you: You are now part of the Escanor cult. Remember that guy from Saint Seiya who only ever trained his grip power? Running around in the forest, strangling bears to death. Frankly, that fella couldn&#039;t even shake Escanor&#039;s hand. Overall, Escanor is the most interesting character I have seen in shonen anime since Hisoka (Hunter x Hunter). Man so manly, he is able to carry pretty much any content with his personality. <br />
<br />
&quot;This must be the nest of humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Galland is the other great character and also a real bro. Only cares about destruction, sees humans as parasites or insects. I admire this character. He does great job on creating the illusion that our main characters are in real danger and might as well die at any point. Without spoiling if this happens by his hands or not, he really does manage to convince me upon his introduction that this might as well be the faith of any character who is not protected by plot armor. The way he manages to corner our main characters is just really badass. It&#039;s surprising even to see how the author challenges his own writing skills by creating such hard-to-overcome situations around Galland. To put is simply: Galland is so merciless that if he had a role in Fairy Tail, I would still be convinced that he can actually kill someone of importance in it.<br />
<br />
As a conclusion, these 2 characters make this season highly enjoyable. The former season + OVA are air to me, I never cared about this franchise until now. The 2nd season of Taizai does one thing right, it is this thing, and it does in a manner which I can give it credit for. Despite all the problems the show has, this season was still of high caliber for approximately 70% of the time.

    This is a short and on point review about the second season of Nanatsu no Taizai.  A-1 Pictures adapted the source material as it did with the previous season but this time it did a good job regarding the characters. After finishing the first season nothing left a good impression, the story and characters become forgettable after some time .<br />
Season 2 solves all the previous problems from the first season and focuses on the bonds between our characters, their past and how they eneded up as the 7 deadly sins making them memorable for our viewers. We also have a new sin Escanor who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282588">
        is probably imo the main reason to watch this season.<br />
<br />
As you watched the ova series you know how Ban ended up being immortal , in addition to that season 2 shows his past as a child and the one who teached him how to be a thief and many more surprises who will bring  a litlle warmth to your hearth....We found out more about Melioda&#039;s lover more about his connection with the 10 Commandments and his bond with Elizabeth. Even the bad guys from season 1 get their reasons explained so they won&#039;t end up just as a tool for the 7 deadly sins to look cool after beating them. Long story short, less fights more worldbuilding and characterization which for I praise A-1 Pictures for sticking to the source material.<br />
<br />
The story overall is not something outstanding it follows the usual shounen formula but what gives some substance and depth to this season are the characters ! Music is good as always the animation top notch(A-1 Pictures always invest tons of cash regarding that..) and enjoyment guaranted nothing more or nothing less from this genre.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment has always been a + factor for this anime and season 2 doesn&#039;t forget to entertain its audience with the character&#039;s humour side and fights. The skills are mostly explained and also in each fight their is a stake involved.. What brought new season 2 in comparasion to season 1 are the Ten Commandments who among them are some interesting characters who you cannot hate them despite being evil. <br />
<br />
 In conclusion this season managed to make me experience a variety of emotions, managed to amaze me and entertain me to a certain point in each episode and finally it left a overall good impression after I finished it. I recommend it to those who are interested in this genre or for the usual Nanatsu no Tazai manga and anime fans.<br />

    Well, in my review of the first season I said that 4 was a lot for Nanatsu in Taizai, so I want to explain why 2 for this season.<br />
Well, I&#039;ll be more direct, the only good thing anime nese are the character traits and designs, that&#039;s it, nothing else.<br />
History: unlike the first that tries to develop something, here there is nothing to be developed, basically the villains appear at the beginning, and stay like this until the last episode, nothing walks, no character is deepened, some even have their moments, and no, the Meliodas does not have a significant deepening, it is simply a flashback

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302923">
        played and only. The story is VERY badly adapted from the manga, with a HORRIBLE, confusing ending, and that explains nothing, apart from a cut from one scene to another without any explanation, the lack of cohesion here is absurd.<br />
Characters: Ruins, but very bad, basically the minor characters are not important, and the curious, they go to a place to train, and guess what? No use, power goes from 1000 to 1050, something ridiculous, basically their existence has no meaning and value in the work, and worst, the work tries to force the contrary.<br />
The characters are hardly in depth, they are useless, they only serve to give spotlight to the principals. And one of the worst things, is to force a character to lose to generate hype on the villain, something disgusting and poor. The villains? Terrible, none of them has been deepened in AN ENTIRE SEASON, they are completely shallow and empty.<br />
The soundtrack here is disappointing, compared to the first one, it&#039;s bad.<br />
Environmentalism remains childish and silly.<br />
Bad and predictable script, no passing excitement, the protagonist remains almost the same throughout the season.<br />
Neither the fights lend, are cut and fast, without any emotion. Not to mention the animation that fell a lot!<br />
Nanatsu is an anime that would not recommend to anyone with critical sense, an anime with Netflix syndrome, that only makes success because of this, an annoying and annoying base fan, composed mostly by adolescents and children.<br />
A horrible anime!

    Very slight spoilers, Not really revealing anything.<br />
<br />
The first couple episodes of season two just pulled me right in.<br />
<br />
This is the best seven deadly sins to date. Everything which is happening are thing I never saw coming.<br />
<br />
I like that, I really like that. Thats the one thing which probably keeps me super interested, is the fact that I really don&#039;t know whats going to happen next.<br />
<br />
Some animes you just know. The MC&#039;s too strong he just destroys all without hitch (irregular at magic high)<br />
<br />
In this one, the mc&#039;s been out matched, out matched in the previous sin as well.<br />
<br />
Hes strong, but he&#039;s not strong enough to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279351">
        beat everyone by himself. <br />
<br />
The other characters aren&#039;t slacking either. King, Diane, Ban, Gowther, Hawk-chan, Elizabeth, merlin, and others they all build their characters through the episodes. It&#039;s awesome progression<br />
<br />
Especially hawk chan after the training. That was funny as hell. I almost couldn&#039;t stop laughing.<br />
<br />
This is my favorite anime atm. I think others should watch Seven deadly sins from the start if they haven&#039;t already.<br />
<br />
Really epic series. I&#039;m far more impressed with season two tho.<br />
<br />
<br />

    The devolution of Seven Deadly Sins into a garb-trash shounen anime.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is stupid. Main sexual assault victim Elizabeth dreams that something is going to happen as well as her father, and neither of them speak up, and the world goes down the shitter with the plot because two idiots who clearly knew something was up said &quot;oh it&#039;s nothing&quot;. Jeez where have I seen that one before.<br />
<br />
Art:The art is the same as S1 as far as i&#039;m concerned. Nothing special.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound is also pretty much the same. I still want to drag my balls across a sea of broken glass whenever Elizabeth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274240">
        speaks. Intro is- ha, you know you&#039;re gonna skip it anyways.<br />
<br />
Character: More of people who clearly dig each other not telling one another because (no reason).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I only enjoy this because the last season was serviceable and I&#039;m eventually gonna see Meliodas at his supposed full-power (which is now numerical because this show is going down the shounen-shitter).<br />
<br />
Frowny face to studio A-1 for ruining another potentially good thing :(

    Edit: I changed my scoring system around a lot and the scores in this review were not really up to date, so I tried adapt them (indicated with *new*) and changed my &#039;overall&#039; part.<br />
<br />
Note: This is my first review on here and I basically just wrote it because I was bored and thought I might just give it a go (I&#039;m kind of venting here so be ready for that).<br />
<br />
Well then, Nanatsu no Taizai 2nd Season (I&#039;ll just call it that). Tbh I don&#039;t really remember 100% how I felt during the first season of this show but this second season seems to be way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281654">
        more of a letdown to me. But let&#039;s go through the points:<br />
<br />
Story: 5 (*new*: 3) - The whole medieval-magical setting with a group of special, strong warriors (The seven deadly sins) fighting evil threats (demons) sounds rather interesting to me, and having those warriors fight a group of special, strong demons (the ten commandments) in an ultimate fight of good vs evil is a pretty cool base concept for a battle shounen.<br />
The problem, however, lies not in the premise but the execution: The clash of those two groups is the main focus of the show and of course you can not just have them start fighting from the very beginning, but the way their fight is delayed seems extremely tedious: annoying sub-plots (one character loses her memory for the 50th time, the characters have to train in a cave for like a day or so, another character runs off to visit his dead girlfriend etc.) are thrown in to keep the main characters from actually figthing the big bad evil guys while said evil guys sit around and do nothing (because they conveniently have to replenish their energy). Together with some uninteresting characters that get introduced (the kings brother or whoever that guy was and his whole squad, Dianes &#039;senpai&#039; etc) this seems to ruin the whole flow and pacing of the show. The build-up of for the final clash does not feel like a  build-up, just one little sup plot happens after another, and then, boom, now we fight the bad guys because we just ran into them.<br />
Speaking of that fight, pretty much the whole cast except maybe two people are utterly useless in that figth: Very early on it gets clear (thanks to some super lame power scale mechanic) that the commandments are way stronger than every character on the good side with the exception of Meliodas who just gets stronger and stronger leaving all his buddys behind as some useless exposition dummys.<br />
The show also has some pretty lame twists in it that were only shocking because of how dumb they seemed (Not trying to spoil anything but keyword Hendrickson for example).<br />
The writing in general seems actually quite horrible in some parts... I mean I don&#039;t expect a battle shounen to have a super complex, deeply thought out plot structure and what not but this show has some moments where I was actually getting furious as to how badly they were written (the mentioned stupid twists, characters coming back when they should be dead, the power levels escalating way too quick, stupid new abilities getting introduced out of nowhere etc...).<br />
<br />
Art: 4 - Just not a big fan of the artstyle (especially the faces and clothing) but it&#039;s not necessarily ugly I guess. Animation is nothing special and seems lacking in some parts but more or less watchable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6 - Does not really stand out to me which does not mean it&#039;s bad, it&#039;s just nothing special either. <br />
<br />
Chracters: 4 (*new*: 2) - Together with the writing probably the worst part of this show (also the part where my opinions influences my enjoyment of the show the most): I just don&#039;t like the characters. Like allready mentioned pretty much everyone aside from Meliodas is super weak compared to the commandments which does not help make these one dimensional, bland characters interesting in any way. A couple of examples: Elizabeth is just there to be sexually assaulted and whine all the time, King&#039;s dialogue seems to have &quot;Diane&quot; in every line, Diane herself does nothing except for... no actually nothing. Arthur, Gilthunder and the other Knights pretty much do the same as Diane and seem to only serve the purpose of showing us how strong the demons (and Meliodas) are. And the worst is probably Meliodas himself, getting stronger everytime the plot needs him to and being a goofy molester all the time (well mostly) when he is not in battle. On the other hand, the commandments do not seem to have any real depth or motivation to them other than &quot;we are evil because we are the evil ones&quot; but since that might get covered in the future I&#039;ll let that slide for now. (EDIT: being on episode 23 now, I&#039;m not really optimistic about that)<br />
Escanor and Ban are two characters I actually like but they are also not really well written in my opinion. <br />
And also what&#039;s with all the backstorys (Diane, King, Ban, Meliodas, Escanor, Elizabeth...)? I mean backstorys are fine and all but that many? For pretty much every important character? Is ist not possible to characterize them without the need of a backstory?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4 (*new*: 3) - In conclusion I don&#039;t find this show very entertaining, there were episodes where I was seriously questioning the authors writing abilities and I thought about dropping it multiple times. While the premise is interesting the characters and the writing are terrible and the animation is mostly mediocre. I don&#039;t want to be your typical Hero Academia d*ck rider but seeing the two shows airing together, thus comparing them, makes Nanatsu no Taizai look even worse.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3 - Because of the reasons listed above I scored this show a 3 out of 10 which indicates a &#039;very bad&#039; or &#039;poor&#039; show. <br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said this review was created on a whim and out of boredom, I pretty much just wrote this down for me but if anyone finds this angry wall of text helpfull that&#039;d be cool too I guess.

    Nanatsu No Taizai S2 is a direct sequel to S1 so please watch S1 first.<br />
<br />
In season 2, following the celebration of peace in Britiana, the member of the Seven Deadly Sins are awarded medals for protecting the country.<br />
<br />
In this season, it shows Ban the Sin of greed &#039;betraying&#039; his team to revive a girl whom he loves. He left the team following which King the Sin of sloth followed him to visit the place where Ban&#039;s love&#039;s body is. Ironically, the girl is King&#039;s sister (revealed in S1).<br />
<br />
With their leave, Meliodas senses a great danger approaching and that is the revival/ release of the Ten

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273936">
        Commandments, said to be the strongest of the Demon Realm, each wielding as much power as Meliodas.<br />
<br />
The story continues as Meliodas&#039;s team has to fight the Ten Commandments while Ban tries to revive his beloved.<br />
<br />
It is also said that the final missing member of the team, Eskanor the sin of pride will be coming into this season and I look forward to that.<br />
<br />
So far, up till episode 5, the anime is developing without a hitch and I hope this can continue.<br />
<br />
Nanatsu No Taizai is probably one of the funniest, most entertaining Shonen anime so far. I&#039;m open to hearing suggestions for other anime.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
<br />
I very much enjoy the new OP and the soundtracks used are not repeated from the previous season so that&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
<br />
Following my review in season 1, the art is made by A-1 Pictures. It&#039;s only normal that it gets a 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall <br />
<br />
Still watching, I just have to say something about the bad reviews which I feel are abit too harsh<br />
<br />
<br />

    This is the best anime I watched so far, and probably that I&#039;m going to.<br />
Not that I&#039;m going to die anytime soon or something, but the past is obliterating. Especially the past and the characters, though I think it&#039;s not presented in the way it deserves.<br />
<br />
Let me clear some points:<br />
The story is not SHALLOW: Not at all, not even 1%. You might think so if you watching the anime on a hurry just to put a check mark, but if you pay the slightest attention, you&#039;d fall deep into the story. A little bit is presented about the characters, or even 3000 years ago and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275115">
        the anime provided no hints about it. Personally I think the anime tells just a brief bit of the story and is going terribly fast without explaining the motives sometimes, this makes me think hard about the story and what might the characters be experiencing, especially those who lived 3000+ years, and it&#039;s frustrating, but deeeeeeep.<br />
<br />
Each character has a really meaningful story behind them, that is almost entirely shadowed, and they don&#039;t seem to tell the story from their expression, which is kinda absurd but deeep, what makes them do that ?<br />
<br />
Powers are O.K., I actually like the system, but they don&#039;t serve a major part of the story. I like the fact that each clan has something special, and how humans attainted significant powers, like godess clan level by making weapons. It&#039;s not free, Arthur sword took thousands of years to forge and is actually unique to humans. If you come from a hardcore fighting anime background like DBZ or only watch naruto fights, you might not like the anime right away.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO FAN-SERVICE, the only instance of this is Meliodas, which is the protagonist, X Elizabeth. And this itself has a story behind it in the manga, as Elizabeth is the .... doing let me spoil. We&#039;ve actually seen him reject doing that to other ladies. Actually the whole sexuality shit is absent in the anime which is kinda cool. But, we&#039;ve seen many characters yearning for their deceased loved ones.<br />
<br />
This is the anime to watch.

    Everyone is strong for no reason, everyone has magical powers capable of doing everything for no reason, the whole story make me nauseous from the very beginning, the show only works thanks to Escanor and Ban because they were funny and badass but otherwise it is horribly disgusting. Nothing’s been ruined it’s exactly the same trash show you’ve been watching from the very beginning it’s just that it was a little less exaggerated in the first season.<br />
<br />
I’ve never seen worse anime in my entire life with dragon ball super and boruto. My God it&#039;s so trash how can that have such a high score...

    I really loved the story and also everything was really new for me because I didn&#039;t read the manga so I gave it a 10/10. The Artwork was also amazing and was also anticipated because they spent a lot of money for the visuals so I decided to give it a 9/10. The sound was really amazing and always switched up my moods. The sad melodies especially the one during the conversation between Fraudrin and Griamore before he tried to commit suicide by making an explosion made me really feel the sadness and nostalgia so I gave it a 10/10. The character developments and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283445">
        new secrets that the anime shared with us was outstanding also a 10/10. I really enjoyed watching every single second of all 24 episodes of the second season of this anime and I&#039;d also say it was better than the first season so I gave it a 10/10. Overall a perfect shonen anime that&#039;s the reason why I rated it with a 10.

    This review might contain some spoilers, but I’ll try to keep it down.<br />
<br />
First of all, I can’t say I disliked this show. To be very honest: I bingewatched it and I enjoyed every single second of it (or almost every second). But, sometimes you shouldn’t judge a show by how much you enjoyed it. Sometimes, you have to have a critic view. And in my critic view, this show kinda really sucks.<br />
<br />
In the second season of Nanatsu no Taizai, we meet some new villains for or hero&#039;s to defeat: The Ten Commandments from the demon clan. This is exactly where I stumble upon the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283109">
        major problem with this second season. The villains are absolutely shallow. There are bad because… well, they’re demon’s, I guess all demons are just evil. They have no motivation whatsoever and their personalities are just… evil. The only villain that manages to go trough a little character development in the season finale, is Fraudrin. (spoiler) He was prepared to wipe away his evil intentions, because he actually loved Griamore, the son of Dreyfus, whom Fraudrin possess for quite some years. For the rest, the villains just get revived and start killing people to be able to reign over the land again – because reigning over a land full of dead bodies is totally fun.<br />
<br />
The second thing that really ruins this show (and this actually annoyed me a bit) is very lazy storytelling. If you need to give a character the power to see the ‘power level’ of others… then you’re just being a lazy ass storyteller. You don’t need to show us a number, show us exactly how dangerous these people are BY MAKING THEM FIGHT. The mangaka also made The Ten Commandments fight, so I don’t actually see the point in giving Hawk the gift to see power levels? Well, maybe that’s just me. That’s not the only part where the mangaka falls back into lazy storytelling. Having the character’s explain things, just weakens the plot. (spoiler) Like, for example, when Fraudrin literally says that he is a replacement, or when The Ten Commandments explain their powers… I mean, you don’t need to let the characters tell us that. We have eyes, we can see it.<br />
<br />
Another thing about power: why are The Ten Commandments so crazy strong? I know that the MC’s need a challenge and all… But really, the difference in power is a little overboard. The only sins that could do something, were Meliodas (cause, duh, he’s the main character), Merlin (because (spoiler) she could totally not take on Galand, but Greyroad, who is supposed to be stronger, is no problem at all) and Escanor (but only when he’s not useless, like, every night, and (spoiler) off course The Ten Commandments attack at day, because why the hell would they wait ‘till night?). For the rest, all other characters were totally useless and I didn’t really get why they were even there.<br />
<br />
Now, let’s go on to the characters. The mangaka probably noticed that Meliodas was not quite a deep character, so (spoiler) he gets some dark power and a shady history as former leader of The Ten Commandments. Elizabeth still has no character at all. I mean, c’mon, we all know the only personality she has, is being nice, helping other people and being high over heels for Meliodas. She has no flaws at all, ‘cause why would a princes need any flaws? The mangaka then decided to (spoiler) make her the reincarnation of a person from Meliodas’ past, while the only thing they have in common, is their hairstyle. (spoiler) Gowther did get some depth, looking for emotion (like that has not been done a thousand times before). And poor Diane (also not the most complex character) (spoiler) lost her memories again. I’m not a fan of memory loss, so when it is done twice, it just breaks my heart. I do think Ban is a nicely developed character though. For the rest, King also only has one characteristic, that being his love for Diane. (spoiler) He maybe did get some development when he saved the fairies, even when they hated them, risking his own life in the process. And Escanor… well, he loves Merlin (because yeah, you can’t have a male and a female character that are not in love with each other).<br />
<br />
Another thing with this shounen, just like any other popular shounen, is that the mangaka is just too afraid to let people die. I mean, the moment you become even a little important, there is absolutely zero chance that your life is in danger. You either find a way to win even against an opponent who is ten times stronger, or you come back to life, or you suddenly get some massive power (#Escanor, #Merlin). Or, not to forget, Elizabeth suddenly develops a healing gift. So, basically; no worries, MC’s aren’t going to die here. And even when they do, they just come back like in any other shounen. I don’t even feel sad when a MC ‘dies’ and I sure as hell don’t feel any danger when he/she has ‘a hard time’.<br />
<br />
Besides all of that, I can’t say one bad word about the music, sound or the art style of this show. The voice acting of Elizath and Diane annoyed me a bit, but maybe that’s just my opinion. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: this anime is perfect if you just wanna sit down and just watch the nicely animated action without thinking too much. If you are looking for something different, of something new, something… let’s say… refreshing… this show isn’t really worth your time.

    A very very very predictable series, and a very very very boring one too. I don&#039;t know why everyone is raving about this series. It&#039;s very predictable. I knew what was going to happen episodes behind. It&#039;s that predictable and boring. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s just too predictable, it&#039;s annoying. I found myself yawning and getting distracted by something else apart from this series, that isn&#039;t good for me. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best anime for the Seven Deadly Sins. <br />
<br />
With that being said, the artwork is great. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I liked the artwork, it&#039;s just the series that&#039;s boring. <br />
<br />
Netflix has the artwork down.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382931">
        It&#039;s good to be fair. <br />
<br />
The story is better than the rest of the series. But still predictable. No main characters dies, meh. <br />
<br />
I found myself saying meh a lot. It&#039;s just too predictable. Again and again, I do not like this predictable series. <br />
<br />
This series&#039; character development is like the first season. <br />
<br />
Overall, I found this series boring.

    This season of Seven Deadly Sins was really a rollercoaster ride. The first half made me want to drop it but by the end I eneded up loving it almost as much as the first season.<br />
<br />
Story: Just like the previous season, its all over the place. The power rankings are just whatever is convenient for the show at the time. Nothing really means anything. Its even more messy than last time. Its supposed to be like this as this show isn&#039;t meant to be taken seriously and its a lot of fun. Just be prepared to scratch your head at least twice every episode.<br />
<br />
Art: Animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294853">
        is very nice just like before. They work with a lot of cool darker tones and colours. Designs are all great, especially the new characters. No complaints at all.<br />
<br />
Sound: I had watched it dubbed becasue idk I just prefered it. Sometimes the voice acting was cringey and off. Merlin&#039;s speech as quiet awkward at times. Sound affects were all very nice. Music was great, it fit the time and place and was still epic. The first theme song will probably be in my playlist!<br />
<br />
Characters: They&#039;re all brilliant. I love most of them, especially Meliodas and Ban. This is what really kept me going and made me pick this anime back up.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: At times you will ask yourself &quot;wtf am I watching&quot; but at others you&#039;ll be laughing and enjoying it loads! If you&#039;re ok with things not always making sense and not reading into greater meaning, you may wanna give this show a go. <br />
<br />

    You know, it&#039;s my first one and english is not my main language so please be kind to a &quot;gaijin&quot; like me. <br />
It may contain spoilers, but as for me it isn&#039;t.<br />
Let&#039;s look at the pros and cons. For the pros, it&#039;s art and characters.<br />
Art 8/10<br />
Design, color and style of entire anime are at a high level and relatively unique. But not everything is perfect, the absurd and inappropriate ecchi accents spoil the whole impression. Btw, i really like ecchi as a genre, but Nanatsu no Taizai is kinda bad example as a realization for this genre.<br />
Characters 6/10<br />
The characters are different—it&#039;s good—but nevertheless not all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313266">
        characters shine with originality. Many of them appear for one short moment to say &quot;sample text&quot; and die. After that the surrounding characters mourn for few seconds and forget it completely. Exciting and cool deaths are not about this anime.<br />
As for the rest, the main characters are more or less interesting to watch, they&#039;re fine.<br />
And here we come to the sweetest part, to the cons. <br />
Plot 4/10<br />
Yes, the plot seems to be there, at least they are trying to bring it to us throughout the 24 episodes. The plot is not terrible, but just bad. Maybe something is happening, and maybe not, maybe someone died, and maybe not, maybe there is a plot, and maybe not. In addition, all these &quot;maybe&quot; are accompanied by inappropriate and ridiculous plot turns. &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;What a twist&quot; are the key concepts for the plot in this anime in general.<br />
Many points raise many questions. For example, the appearance of a device used to measure power levels, I imagine how Hawk breaks it and yells &quot;It&#039;s Over 9000!&quot;. Unnamed enemies whom we don&#039;t know about, but we got a ton of senseless romance instead.<br />
Earlier, I said that the characters are more or less interesting, but their presentation is bad. Ridiculous romance lines, appearence of new or long-forgotten characters for a short moment, which later will be completely forgotten, the terrible characters development and their contradictory actions bring all their brightness and originality to nothing.<br />
As a result, instead of an exciting well-built plot, as it could be, we get a curved and bumpy road for Paris – Dakar Rally.<br />
OST 6/10<br />
Average soundtrack. It is not supported by any strong plot moments, so you won’t remember it after watching. It&#039;s just Ok. <br />
Enjoyment 3/10 <br />
To be honest, this anime is not interesting at all. For me it was a challenge to watch until the end. I even wanted to drop it, but constantly gave a second chance right up to the last episode. There were some good moments, but more often it was boring. It seemed to me the second season would be exciting in all aspects, but I was wrong.<br />
Overall 4/10<br />
Well, that&#039;s the final part. Nanatsu no Taizai: Imashime no Fukkatsu for me was a complete disappointment, especially as a sequel. Everything could have been much better, but in the end we got nothing. I do not recommend this anime for viewing, just a waste of time.<br />
However, thanks for reading my review.
