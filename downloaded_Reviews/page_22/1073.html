    Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin is a 13 episode anime series based off a currently publishing novel series. Odds are, you already have realized a couple things, but if not here they are now: First, this series tidies up an arc at the end, but it otherwise has an open ending. Second, odds are there won&#039;t be a second season; if lucky, there will be an OVA in the future, but it likely won&#039;t even be that. So, if these two factors are a big deal, you may want to wait on watching the series. If you don&#039;t mind, continue reading for a more

        detailed review.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The anime is essentially composed of a few sections, which each section tidying up neatly, while still being open to the next section. This allows the anime to flow nicely, though unfortunately, also leaves the series with a somewhat open ending; though the arc is tidies up, the viewer is left knowing that much is to follow along with foreshadowing, and it just isn&#039;t covered. Granted, anime based off of light novels serve not just to gather and entertain viewers, but to serve as an advertisement of sorts for the novel series, so this is to be expected.<br />
As for the specifics, while the whole premise isn&#039;t made entirely clear, enough information is given to where the viewer won&#039;t dwell on the lack of information; also keep in mind, it&#039;s common for lots of details to miss making it from the novel series to the anime, so for minimal omission to seem apparent is pretty good on the anime&#039;s part. The setting seems to be perhaps a fantasy enlightenment period, with the main contrast being the female military uniforms, which have leggings and school skirts (since how could any anime girl not wear a pleated skirt as part of her main outfit?). Though the fantasy element is light, involving only the use of spirits (which some scenes may have you wondering whether they are fantasy or more sci-fi), the implementation of the spirits in the series adds to the fantasy feel.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
What can I say? It&#039;s not terrific, nor experimental, but it&#039;s clear and crisp. Nothing to wow over, but nothing to complain over either.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The voices suited the characters well I feel. The opening and closing also fit the series. The series does a good job overall with using music in scenes, though there were a couple times where it bordered annoying for me.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
While the main characters fall into stereotypes, they were portrayed well, to where they helped the story. A few of the characters remained rather static, while a few of the others grew over the course of the anime, which fit into the character types. The series also does a good job in reminding us that the characters are in a war.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
This series had a mix of my favorite genre, favorites character types, and was based of a novel series so I started watching it expecting to highly enjoy it; thankfully, for me at least, it met my expectations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this series a 9. I can see someone who&#039;s into &quot;typical&quot; shounen anime finding this series slow and boring, so if fast-paced action is what you&#039;re looking for, this series may not be for you. While this is a fantasy military anime, this is of a totally different strain than, say, the Gundam series. If you enjoy seeing what happens behind the action in war scenes, with action scenes involving character&#039;s planning counter-actions as much as actual action, this series is one you&#039;ll likely enjoy. If a semi-open ending is something that will bug you, you&#039;ll have to personally decide whether it&#039;s worth watching; if you enjoy this series, by the end you&#039;ll be wishing the light novels were being published by Yen Press. Hope this helped!

    Alderamin on the Sky isn&#039;t an overly impressive anime by all means, but it is enjoyable for what it is. It is a military, strategy themed anime which focuses on the cruel reality of war, politics, and how our MC, Ikta Solork, makes his legend by displaying his superb talents as a strategist. <br />
<br />
The plot isn&#039;t original, but that isn&#039;t always a bad thing. Alderamin is mainly focused on the war between two neighboring empires Katjvarna and the Republic of Kioka, and the struggles of Ikta and his comrades fighting in the war. Besides the ongoing warfare between the two countries, there are also tension

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230664">
        within the empire and other battles with various clans. The usage of strategies are pretty good and the battles are meaningful. Unfortunately, early on, Alderamin suffers from a slow start, taking around three episodes to really get going and not really explaining too much during that time. However, after a couple of episodes, Alderamin quickly grew on me. The first real battle scene they showed brought a lot of promise, and it brought a much needed darker tone to the story. One thing I would&#039;ve liked explained earlier though, was this little things called spirits who help fight in battle. They are there, but aren&#039;t exposed enough until late in the show. To be really honest, I feel like the show could&#039;ve done just fine without these little creatures.<br />
<br />
These problems could&#039;ve been fixed had there been more episodes. I always feel like 13 episodes or 1 cour isn&#039;t enough for many, especially action/war based anime to really accomplish their full potential in terms of storytelling, characters, and the overall depth. Most of the times, the story will be rushed, and in Alderamin&#039;s case, since it started of very slow, the anime suffered from pacing and development issues.<br />
<br />
The animation is the standout point of the series for me. Although a bit inconsistent in pacing at times, Madhouse still impressed me in the end. The efforts they put in each episode in terms of the action is refreshing to see. In an anime like this, awesome battles need to make you feel excitement and hyped, and madhouse delivers just that. The battles are brutal and bloody. The character designs are pretty good and the animation as a whole was crisp.<br />
<br />
The op and ed are great, but a part of me wishes that the soundtracks were more memorable. It is good for what it is; doesn&#039;t feel out of place or anything, but it could have been better and more impactful. The voice acting is pretty good for each characters and personalities. We could&#039;ve used a little bit more emotion in their voice though.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite aspects of the series is definitely the MC, Ikta Solork. He isn&#039;t like all those generic, hardworking MCs like other series. In fact he is lazy and doesn&#039;t hide his  love for women. However, beneath that layer, you really get to know that he is very intelligent and caring for his comrades. He isn&#039;t afraid to take risks in battles and forming strategies. He manages to somehow be badass while having a lazy personality. Although he isn&#039;t the greatest character, he is a breath of fresh air from the overdone MC cliches. In a way he could be compared to Itami from the Gate series. Both are lazy and aren&#039;t exactly that &quot;hero&quot; type but their other personality shines in battles. <br />
Although the other main cast is on the generic side, one other character that deserves a mention is the main heroine Yatori. Although she herself could be classified as a generic female MC of any battle anime, it is her relationship with Ikta that makes her likable. Although she is the stronger fighter, you can tell that she still looks up to Ikta&#039;s talents and believes in him during when others might doubt his strategies. She isn&#039;t annoying nor thinks she is supreme to the MC in any way, which was refreshing to see at times. <br />
Besides the two MCs, the other characters, besides Chamille are a bit underdeveloped. The unfortunate thing about this is that normally, if the characters were entertaining enough, I wouldn&#039;t have minded if the development happened later on in the series, but for Alderamin, the other characters aren&#039;t just interesting enough. One thing I did like is that the main cast all had a purpose for fighting in the war, whereas in many other anime, the purpose can be buried away without explanation. Also they are actually helpful. However, they certainly could&#039;ve been written a bit better.<br />
<br />
Overall, Alderamin on the Sky is an good show, but nothing outstanding. It starts slow but once the pace picks up, it becomes an entertaining show for what it is. The plot could have been better, the characters could have certainly be explored more, and it indeed stayed on the generic side of things at times, but the intense battle scenes and the fun personality of the MC kept me wanting for more. With the story not yet being finished, we are left with an open ending. Alderamin on the Sky is definitely a worthwhile show to pick up.

    &quot;Great soldiers die from overworking&quot; - Ikta Solork<br />
<br />
This anime was actually quite the surprise where it was presented at first as a typical battle harem anime, but instead brought us an anime about tactical warfare and two rather unique main characters.<br />
<br />
The plot of Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin is more focused on it&#039;s war themes as well as their religious elements that enforces the war themes and puts them in conjunction with it&#039;s interesting characters.<br />
<br />
Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin&#039;s chaarcter like Ikta Solork voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto and Yatorishino Igsem voiced by Risa Taneda are some very interesting characters, Ikta is forced to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230662">
        be in the army after an incident where he wanted to have a more relaxing life and commonly disobeys the the higher ups (or be smarter than them in general), he is by all accounts a genius tactician but wants to use the easiest or the most peaceful way to resolve things...sure he&#039;s a womanizer typical of the battle harem anime, but this really isn&#039;t a battle harem anime. As for Yatorishino, she is more or less the main heroine of this anime and is the &quot;OP class character&quot;, but she develops as to why she has her deadpanned and loyal behavior to both the Empire and Ikta. As for the other cast members like Chamille Kitora Katjvanmaninik voiced by Inori Minase, the third princess of the Katjvarna Empire, Haroma Becker voiced by Haruka Chisuga a medic, Torway Remion voiced by Ryousuke Kanemoto a sniper and Matthew Tetojirichi voiced by Junji Majima the second lieutenant in the main cast group although some do get their small character arcs like Torway and Chamille, the plot tends to focus more on Ikta and Yatorishino as well as it&#039;s more serious war storyline than anything else. But for LA&#039;s favourite character in the anime it easily goes to the badass Yatorishino...because she&#039;s a BADASS, not to mention her relationship with Ikta is a rather unique one from &quot;typical battle harem fair&quot;. Which brings up a good point, as much as Yatorishino is LA&#039;s favourite character and an utter badass, it&#039;s Ikta that steals the show with his genius level intellect and tactical cunning on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
Really the &quot;typical harem fair&quot; isn&#039;t a bad thing as it hardly IS a battle harem, instead it&#039;s more of a tactical warfare anime and brings up it&#039;s themes of war as a template, quite easily it tells us about how &quot;tradition&quot; although makes the foundation can&#039;t withhold without the passing of time as such Ikta is showing us that things need to change for the &quot;tradition&quot; to stay and &quot;evolve&quot;, tradition being in place of the Empire&#039;s military regime and it&#039;s evolution in Ikta and his strategies and evolution in military power and really even the themes of this anime can hold the anime on it&#039;s own as it is profound in how they execute it. On a grander scale, it also shows the corruption of the &quot;side&quot; Ikta is in and how he with his different outlook and genius intellect on the battlefield can change the tide of the WHOLE Empire and raze the corruption with his beliefs of protecting those closest to him and NOT for &quot;winning&quot; the praise of the corrupt Empire he&#039;s serving under forceful pretenses. <br />
<br />
As later down to line, the plot changes to two &quot;genius commanders&quot; going at it a la L and Light just under a warfare setting and really it really exposes how Ikta is on the OTHER side of the &quot;great battles that whittle down or outright decimate the opposition&quot;, it also once again develops Ikta by going into detail what kind of mental gymnastics he&#039;s trying to think up trying to both protect his army and defeat the opposing warring army (by the way it&#039;s these kinds of tactical warfare LA really gets invested in). On the supporting side it also shows that Yatrisino will always have Ikta&#039;s back even in DEATH really cementing this dynamic of commander and soldier. Because of this kind of focus on Ikta and Yatorishino as well as the &quot;other genius-equal to Ikta&quot;, the focus really kicks Torway, Matthew and Haroma into minor character status and are really turned into pawns for Ikta in the process. The least developed character all round actually goes to Chamille the Princess as she is essentially in the sidelines as Ikta and his army is trying to defend against this new warring army.<br />
<br />
The plot twists really comes in once Ikta has an equal fighting against him from the later storyline and just seeing the &quot;game of chess&quot; these two play and how they outwit each other makes the &quot;warfare plot twists&quot; all the more intriguing. Outside from that storyline, it is expected Ikta to survive along with his group and yes for the most part he does, but when other minor characters get into the mix and Ikta WANTS to protect them, that is where the plot twist deaths comes in and some are really unpredictable at times which again hones in in Ikta&#039;s belief to protect everyone but even if he has the intellect to do so but doesn&#039;t have the power to also comes in. Because of this, Ikta really is a fleshed out character from his beliefs to his intellect to his focus on the plot itself.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, the animation done by Madhouse, well it&#039;s expected of Madhouse to put this much detail in everything and they succeeded once again, from the tactical battles, to the medieval-ish anachronistic weaponry to the polished character designs make the animation look very nice to watch and as for the battles, well some of the best battles and gorn goes to Yatorishino&#039;s battles, but the more widespread out tactical warfare has it&#039;s animation moments as well.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, well across the board, the voice acting was amazing, though LA&#039;s favourite voice actor HAS to go to Risa Taneda as Yatorishino, her &quot;himedere&quot; vocals were always great to hear. Not much to talk with voice acting section other than it was amazing and expected LA was gonna go for Risa Taneda.<br />
<br />
Ohh boy the ending...guess Madhouse has ANOTHER sequel LA wants outta shows they made and Nejimaki is no exception. Yes the ending left at a really great  point in the story and focuses in Princess Chamille and Ikta about the Empire itself and because of what Chamille wants Ikta to do and &quot;complicated&quot; notion of doing such a thing has gotten LA intriguing and wanting more which was why yes, it left in a &quot;read the manga&quot; ending. Before that the previous &quot;arc&quot; between Ikta and Jean (the other genius commander) was left though anti-climactically, once again the tactics Ikta used was GREAT in making the climax of the battle of attrition Ikta and Jean went through all the more worth it no matter how anti-climactic it was.<br />
<br />
Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin by all means has it&#039;s problems and strengths as typical for any kind of media but for LA, Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin shined when talking about the tactical warfare element as well as Ikta and Yatorishino&#039;s relationship as well as in the animation, it&#039;s flaws came in that the supporting cast members were nothing but that and some people might see that Ikta as the source of the problem as he is your &quot;win all OP protagonist under the &quot;genius&quot; character&quot;. But with this LA can say that Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin has been more of a hidden gem of Summer 2016, seeing a fictional land give realistic terms of warfare and it&#039;s implications it has before and after the battle has been done and the dynamic between Ikta, Chamille and Yatorishino shows it in the form of the Empire&#039;s corruption, ideals and hierarchy.

    War is not without causalities. Or a purpose. Or strategies. I must admit, watching Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin (Aldermain on the Sky) reminds me of many war movies I’ve seen although it’s also quite different than what I had anticipated. Maybe it’s the military gimmicks or the character relationships. But for what’s worth, Alderamin may surprise you in more places than one.<br />
<br />
Adapted from the light novel, I was slightly disappointed that the show is only 1-cour. After all, there is more than enough content for a 2-cour length series so when I heard the show would only feature 13 episodes, my hyped died

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230637">
        down a bit. This may also feel more like a personal opinion but for most war themed series, there needs to be a coherent amount of storytelling that matches in par with its drama. Alderamin’s pacing is questionable at times but not something that gets in the way of itself from succeeding.<br />
<br />
The premise of the show is somewhat complicated. First, we have to understand the setting as it takes place in a world where the Katjvarna empire has waged war against the Republic of Kioka. All sorts of reasons evoked this war ranging from politics, imperialism, royalty, etc. At the center of it, we have 17-year old Yatorishino Igesm (also known as Yatori), a prominent member of the Imperial House noble family. Along with her, there’s Ikta Solork, a womanzing man that also gets involved with military affairs. From the start, their character chemistry is undeniable and it’s known that they have a history based on their background story. Meanwhile, Yatori takes the High Grade Military Officer exam and things get complicated when she, Yatori, and others are stranded deep behind enemy lines. It gets even more complicated when Ikta recuses the young princess Chamile Kitora Katjvanmaninik, who also happens to be the third princess of Katjvarna. Talk about a miraculous coincidence. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, we quickly learn that Ikta isn’t just a womanzing bum but also one with a strategic mind who is not afraid of taking risks. His heroic actions along with Yatori, Torway, Matthew, and Haroma earns them the title “Imperial Knights”. Their reactions isn’t exactly gratitude though so viewers will have to anticipate on the ‘why?’ I have to say, this series has a lot of mystery and most of it isn’t exactly so easy to decipher on paper. The political affairs and character dynamics itself are also part of that. First, we don’t know a whole lot about Yatori or Ikta. Both of them are very different in terms of personalities and background. However, it is shown that they have a good friendship from the past as they once fought for survival together. Meanwhile, Ikta proves himself as a skilled tactician as he is able to come up with brilliant strategies for his party and on the battlefield. On the other hand, Yatori is a top student at her military academy and proves it with her unmatched fighting skills in particular with a sword. She also proves herself as a very hard worker, another contrast to Ikta’s lazy personality. However, both of them do have interesting ideals and reasons to believe in what they should be fighting for. It’s also noticeable that Ikta never really makes a move on Yatori despite his playboy ways. Instead, they share a rather unique friendship. Having being raised under strict circumstances, Yatori discovers new wonders about the world thanks to Ikta during her childhood. All she did before was studying and training.<br />
<br />
Of course, Ikta and Yatori aren’t just the main characters. There’s also others that proves themselves worthy of their positions in the military. Torway is a known for his long range sniping skills and handsome face (amusingly, Ikta doesn’t like handsome men in general). Haroma, the healer of the group, is known for being one of the friendliest and shyest character in the series. Finally, there’s also Matthew who starts off as a newbie but steadily works his way up as a worthy fighter. While the show concentrates mostly on Ikta and Yatori’s role, it also doesn’t neglect their comrades. The fact is, war is a dark reality that everyone has to accept. It breeds controversy that leads to hatred which leads to death and sorrow. Ikta is a guy that hates war but still fights for what he believes in. Similarly, others have their own reasons to risk their lives.<br />
<br />
At its core, the show does a fairly decent job at storytelling despite some pacing issues. Most episodes connect each other while some others focus more on characterization. As smooth as it can be, the show does have some fairly predictable moments especially with death of certain characters.  I also have to admit the series does a good job at portraying mixed gender roles. Female officers aren’t always a major focus in military fiction but in this anime, it definitively captures their role and importance. In the meantime, the world building of Alderamin is also a strong factor. Perhaps some of it even has a connection to Japanese history or other related parts of the real world. I can also safely say that the show does a fair job at balancing the lighthearted moments between the more serious, focused segments. <br />
<br />
Adapted by Madhouse, I was initially underwhelmed by the character designs. They honestly look like something made from a shoujo manga with their same faces. However, it’s pretty easy to get accustomed to them especially after seeing the characters in action. Remember, this isn’t a love series but a war story. Weapons are also adapted well with fine degree of creativity ranging from the steampunk vehicles, guns, mortars, and elemental spirits. On the other hand, character expressions bounces between impressive to underwhelming. They are fairly well done when characters engage in battle (ex. Yatori demonstrating her sword skills) but during comedic moments, they feel more flat. I can’t say more than that though as this could be more of a personal perspective. However, the background sceneries are constructed pretty well with fine details, rich resources, and really gives the feeling of what a battlefield is like at war. As such, expect violence to occur with little censorship to portray a more realistic feeling of bloodshed. <br />
<br />
Well it’s not the best thing in the world but don’t underestimate the music aspects of Alderamin. The cinematics matches in par with the coordinated OST while battle segments are supplemented by the instrumental notes. I am also impressed by Ikta’s voice actor for portraying a character that I initially thought would dislike but convinced me otherwise with his ability to play such a complex character. Risa Taneda’s voice as Yatori is also recognizable if you’ve Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Katori), Strike the Blood (Yukina), GATE (Rory). <br />
<br />
Well, if you’re a fan of military fiction and war stories, this is definitely something to keep an eye on. Even if you’re not though, Alderamin takes a unique approach at storytelling with its main characters. Between the politics and character drama, there’s a deeper insight on why events occur. As a 1-cour adaptation though, I am disappointed that some episode feels rushed. In general, LN adaptations usually depend on how much story is being focused. And while Alderamin did its best at that, it still feels like the show didn’t explore its full potential. However, the show is more than just the generic LN adaptations we see with the main protagonist getting a harem. It’s more of a war story that shows no mercy.<br />

    Just what is going on with Alderamin on the Sky? (Re-Upload)(Mild spoilers)<br />
Today I rant. <br />
For way to long (~6 min.) about a character that way to many people like <br />
<br />
If the anime industry were a living, breathing person, she would likely be diagnosed with cancer. This cancer has a name; Pandering, Faceless Protagonists. Oh yeah, you’ve seen these guys around; anti-social drama queens like Kirito and Ouma Shu; bland bleeding-hearts like Tatsumi (Akame ga Kill); overpowered pretty-boys like Ayato; and, more recently, folks like Ikta Solork, the invincible, lazy pillock. These characters, and the shows they inhabit, are like Swiss cheese; they look good at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230845">
        first, but they’re full of holes, and if you keep them around too long they’ll stink to high heaven. <br />
These “your-face-here” protagonists shamelessly pander to their audience by fulfilling their fantasies; often surrounded by drama, veritably drowning in women, and eventually showered with the praises and victory the audience believes they deserve. Except for Tatsumi. Tatsumi dies. Tatsumi doesn’t get a happy ending. No I’m not mad, why do you ask? Baka!<br />
Don’t be fooled though; these characters are superficially attractive, designed to sucker in poor scrubs who don’t know better. They are, in the opinion of some, a proverbial sickness within the medium of anime. And guess what;<br />
that cancer just hit stage four.<br />
<br />
Alderamin on the Sky doesn’t deserve much praise, and the root if it’s many problems is none other than our resident lazy sod. Meet Ikta Solork, a character so bankrupt he makes studio Manglobe look rich. (sorry Manglobe) Ikta is a pathetic waste of hard-working animators’ precious time. Perhaps the worst protagonist I’ve seen this year, his character is full of contradictions and bad attributes that made the show an actual burden to watch. <br />
Here’s where things get complicated.<br />
It is indescribably frustrating and difficult to explain WHY a character like this is objectively terrible. The two biggest reasons for this are that enjoyment of a show and its characters is largely subjective, and can’t accurately be judged by one man’s standard. Although this holds true to a degree, it has become the rallying cry of people who’ve run out of sound arguments to defend their favorite shows and characters. The phrase “That’s just your OPINION!” has become a mantra for these guys; a convenient cop-out that you’ll hear everywhere on social media. Secondly is that, historically, the kind of people who admire an MC like Ikta are mainly lazy Otakus. People who would like nothing more than to have their lazy way of life affirmed. And Ikta Solork does exactly that. <br />
You don’t need to take MY word for it; lets let the story speak for itself. <br />
<br />
I wasn’t Joking about all those contradictions, and since they’re far less subjective we’ll start there. <br />
<br />
How about we begin by addressing the elephant in the room; the blatant disconnect between Ikta’s worldview and his skill set. <br />
From the get-go, Ikta is portrayed as a rather carefree, lazy person. Seriously, the dude worships hammocks; in the PV, he’s in a hammock; the first time we meet him on screen, he’s in a hammock; his group is trapped behind enemy lines and what does the magnificent bastard do? He builds a hammock. And while I did get a laugh out of his apparent hammock fetish, the point couldn’t be more clear; Ikta Solork is lazy.<br />
Despite this, by the end of the first few episodes, Ikta displays an inexplicable amount of tactical proficiency and knowledge of military strategy. Additionally, as if the ‘chessboard’ scene in the OP wasn’t enough, they paint him as a brilliant strategist, able to call the shots of a chess game he isn’t even watching. Brief rabbit trail, but using chess as an analogy or metaphor for someones genius is a trite and broken trope in and of itself; it’s an easy go-to when you want to make a strategist look cooler, and Alderamin seems to use it just to check a box on the ‘main character checklist’. <br />
On that note, lets get into the finer details. The gist of this contradiction is that it is highly unlikely, bordering on impossible, that anyone with Ikta’s worldview (lazy, arrogant attitude, disregard for authority, dislike of the military, general selfishness) would be able to, or would even want to, achieve a high level of knowledge and competence in military strategy. In short, I’m calling BS on his strategic genius, and here’s why; Achieving such a high level of skill in something as complicated as military strategy would require a lot of diligent study and practice; It would require years of hard work, something Ikta Solork actively avoids. Also, we learn as early as episode one that Ikta Solork doesn’t like the military, and he states on a couple occasions that he wants nothing to do with them. This flies right in the face of his abilities; WHY, when he’s that lazy, would Ikta devote so much of his time and energy to master the art of war, especially when he hates the military? It doesn’t make sense! Consider this; Ikta, for better or worse, is a real smooth talker, and apparently has the skill (or connections) to forge a new identity. Why then, if he’s that good, would he not choose an easy place, far from war and full of women, to live his lazy life, since that’s what he clearly desires? It just doesn’t add up!<br />
“OBJECTION!” a fanboy squeals, dropping his pizza to hammer on his greasy keyboard, <br />
“Ikta’s father was a general! His dad must have taught him all he knew! He only hates the military now because they put his father in prison!”<br />
………………………………Okay, I guess this was inevitable. <br />
Trite and lazy as this explanation is, it’s the best, and most logical response I’ve been able to find, but its still wrong. Here’s why; If you visit any high school, and even places like my college, you’ll find people who don’t want to be there; they take a seat in the back, clearly indifferent to whatever they could be learning. Many of them are actually decent people, but they’re lazy. They’re there because they have to be, or don’t have anything better to do. Just because you lead the horse to water doesn’t mean he’ll drink. I bring this up because Ikta is in a similar spot. In all honesty, I think it’s perfectly reasonable to assume his father’s imprisonment, and later death, sparked Ikta’s hate for the military. However, this doesn’t change the fact that Ikta Solork is, and was, a lazy, arrogant turd. It is unlikely that his father, as a general, would take his family with him on deployment (especially in that world/time period) and even more unlikely that he would have the time or patience to instruct a young Ikta in the ways of war. But even if you did try to burn some smarts into little Ikky’s brainpan, you can’t make him care; He just doesn’t have to, and I’d put money on the fact that he wouldn’t. Why? Well, they say like father, like son; his father, as mentioned before, died in prison. We learn in episode two that Ikta’s old man didn’t respect authority either, after disobeying orders one too many times, he had his command revoked and got thrown in the joint. <br />
Yes, Ikta Solork had a fine role model indeed.<br />
But even if Ikta did, for some reason, want to be a soldier as a kid, it strains credulity to think he could learn all that before his father’s humiliation and, we assume, his corresponding change of heart toward military affairs.<br />
None of it adds up. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. <br />
Oh look! The fanboy returns! Actually, this next objection came from a friend of mine who, in case you’re wondering, lives in his mum’s basement, and has probably forgotten more about hentai than you and I will ever know. <br />
Listen to this, <br />
“Well… Maybe he (Ikta) is just naturally talented, y’know? Some people take naturally to things. maybe he’s just good at it.”<br />
……………………………………………………………… Story time: As I’m writing this, the Olympics are happening in Rio, and Michael Phelps is out there doing what he does best; swimming. I don’t doubt that Phelps took quite naturally to swimming, but talent alone didn’t win him Olympic gold. <br />
I don’t need to explain this to you. <br />
Folks, if you think people like Ikta Solork are “going places”, or that laziness breeds success, life is gonna give you a hardy bitch-slap one day. “Maybe he doesn’t have to try, maybe he’s just that good at it.” This argument is morbidly depressing, and I have only one thing to say for it: You wish. <br />
But they do. And Ikta Solork turns right around and says “wish granted”.<br />
The contradictions don’t end there.<br />
Ikta is lazy, but he mastered advanced skills.<br />
He’s selfish, but he jumps into the ocean in a storm to save a girl he doesn’t know.<br />
He doesn’t think much of others, but gets sentimental when they bury a fallen enemy.<br />
He threatens the princess’ life for badmouthing his mum, but has no reservations about having sex with his squad sergeant’s mother. Seriously. If the dude&#039;s that protective of HIS mum, could he really do that to someone else without flinching? Thats a fucked up (and inconsistent) set of ethics.<br />
And on that subject, what about a few old ‘rules’ of storytelling? ‘Cause he screws them too, right up main street and not gently. It’s hilarious; the handwriting is on the wall in bold print by the end of episode one when the narrator drops the line “He will come to be known as the invincible, lazy general”. This statement renders all emotional stakes null and void. After all, why should we worry, let alone care about a character that can’t lose when his military exploits are the focus of the show? It’s a foregone conclusion that he’ll become a general, and when he does he’ll be the same old lazy bum he’s always been. Where are the stakes? This declaration of Ikta’s impending success tells us that Ikta is never going to change or develop as a character, he’s never going to lose, and he’ll never be required to exert any visible effort to achieve his goals. I’m baffled that they thought this was a good idea, but I can still see why; you see, Ikta Solork is first, and foremost, a product, carefully designed to sell to his audience. Despite Ikta’s obvious problems, his character is tailored in a way that makes its easy to rationalize absolutely everything about him, including his unrealistic skills. Its absurd; it makes me want to laugh and vomit blood at the same time. Even now I can hear the voice of that old fish dude from Star Wars in the back of my head saying “It’s a trap”.<br />
<br />
In the end, Ikta Solork is just a fictional person, and this aint the inquisition. Is he a bad character? Yes. Did I go a bit overboard? Yes, and for that I apologize. I like to keep things light, but after Alderamin I forgot how to smile. Guess I’ll be re-watching Konosuba again.<br />
<br />
There. I’m done.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, I actually care what you have to say, so if you liked this, or think I missed anything important, let me know, I’d be glad to hear it. <br />
Anyway, thanks for reading.<br />

    There are no words to describe my desire to rate this show highly. I want to like it, truly, I do. However I just can’t. No amount of rationalization can justify me giving this show positive accolades. <br />
<br />
So the premise is that we have a war between a generic Empire and an equally generic Republic, a war that the viewer barely ever sees over the course of the series. Despite that going on, the viewer spends most of their time with a group of small, but talented, military school students faffing about. It isn’t until a major shift in the conflict thrusts this stalwart group

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230930">
        into the fire and the flames. <br />
<br />
This premise should make for a satisfying, popcorn-munching couple of hours. The viewer witnesses the rise of a group of military school cadets, who are just trying to survive, amidst the backdrop of two civilizations waging war on an epic scale. Sounds all well and good, yet it falls majorly short of what it could be.<br />
<br />
There is very little reason to care about this conflict. It has utterly failed to give the viewer a reason to be emotionally invested in what is going on. Major questions are left unanswered: Why are these guys fighting? For what reason, other than the fact that the MC is on their side, should we root for the Empire? What makes the Republic the bad guys? Why should I care about any of this? For a show that is largely centered about a major armed conflict, there is hardly any reason to care about the nations involved. <br />
<br />
We are told so little about this world. I want to learn more about the Alderan Church, those spirit creatures, and more of the people of both sides. I want to see the history of these two nations, and how they came to be enemies. There are so many shortcomings in the world building. As a result, I grown to not care about the Empire, or the people that live there. I care even less about the Republic, because I know even less about whatever that place is.<br />
<br />
Another major letdown are the characters. The only real characters of note are Ikta Solork and Ms. Igsem, and the only noteworthy character relationship is between these two. Their classmates are uninspiring at best. The rival genius character that is supposed to go toe-to-toe with Ikta arrives far too late to establish any sort of history and dynamic rivalry with Ikta.<br />
<br />
The plot, while it does have satisfying moments, still leaves room for improvement. Until the final arc, there is no sense of tension for most of the show. Ikta is a freakishly smart military genius, his victory is assured. There is never any doubt in the viewer’s mind that he will win. It suffers the same problem that I had with No Game No Life: the characters are simply TOO GOOD at what they do. It’s just not fun.<br />
<br />
BOTTOM LINE: A Potentially great military drama seriously held back by sub-par world building and lackluster characters.  NOT RECOMMENDED.<br />

    Just skip to the TL;DR because i dont want to spoil the entire show.<br />
<br />
This show suffers from the plague that are LN tropes and a weak writer. While it was really easy to watch and the premise was somewhat interesting i found the final product to be quite average.<br />
<br />
This is a show that had a lot of potential and you could see how it could be amazing but it failed miserably, i would say it was disappointing to see what could have been a great show become this.<br />
<br />
Characters- The main character and the red haired girl have a interesting relationship, but thats about it, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230774">
        any of the other characters are worth mentioning. Yeah they exist, they have their place in the story but they are barely memorable.<br />
<br />
In fact i actually think the best character in the show was a side character that showed up in a few episodes, unfortunately i cannot recall her name, ill just call her soldier girl.<br />
<br />
The worst character was without a doubt clan leader girl, everything that happens around her is just one big coincidence, wouldnt really want to spoil things though.<br />
<br />
Story - It peaked around episode 8, its not exactly the best story ever but there are a few moments that where pretty well executed. The tactics used where pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
Its very difficult to stay immersed in this story even though it is a easy digestible and fun watch.<br />
<br />
Its hard to explain why for me this didnt work, while the story seemed pretty good. It had a lot to do with the dialogue of the show (calling things lazy when they are just efficient and repeating it over and over again. Or calling things scientific for no reason). A lot of the &quot;coincidences&quot; of the show just didnt sit right with me<br />
<br />
Art - Sound - its average, has its moments where its well animated has its moments where its not, the art style is quite boring and so are the character designs. Sound is also pretty average, doesnt stand out at all.<br />
<br />
TL;DR- While i do have quite a few complaints with the show i found it quite enjoyable and if you are checking this review to see if you should watch it or not, i say:<br />
<br />
yeah watch it, its entertaining.

    One of my favourite kinds of story is the one the involves an unlikely hero who leads a team of underdogs against a vastly superior opponent. Alderamin on the Sky fits most of the criteria and that&#039;s what drew me to the show.<br />
<br />
The plot of Alderamin is simple and easy to grasp; it&#039;s focussed on the war between two nations and the trials of a group of soldiers within that war. While the plot isn&#039;t unique or outstanding, it&#039;s execution in Alderamin is remarkable. The show focusses on the tensions that arise due to the warring nations and the various connectionss and conflicts involved. A

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233315">
        good example is a focus on the relationship between an invading army and its captives (for want of a better term).<br />
<br />
The show starts out a bit slowly but introduces us to its central themes almost immediately: the MC and his colleagues are involved in a brutal battle that&#039;s resolved by the MC&#039;s brilliant application of strategic thinking. We&#039;re also introduced to the main characters and the concept of spirit partners. Unfortunately, the spirits aren&#039;t explained until later in the show.<br />
<br />
The art in Alderamin is gorgeous and I&#039;m not exaggerating. The characters, both male and female, are pretty; sometimes, they&#039;re too pretty as is the case of Princess Chamille. The backgrounds often had the right tones applied and weren&#039;t too colourful or bland. The animation, especially in the battle scenes, is quick and fluid although it&#039;s a little inconsistent in the less excitable scenes. One gripe I did have with the art was the sometimes inconsistent body proportions. For example, Haru&#039;s shoulders were sometimes broader than they usually are.<br />
<br />
I wish the music in Alderamin was as wonderful as the sound. While the scores weren&#039;t, they weren&#039;t memorable either and often didn&#039;t evoke the emotions their accompanying scenes required. I often use music to remember key scenes in anime but none of the scores did that for me in Alderamin; the battle music wasn&#039;t epic and the sad melodies weren&#039;t gripping enough. On the other hand, the opening theme for Alderamin was full of action montages that always whet my appetite for each episode and closely matched the show&#039;s overarching themes. The ending was a little more dramatic and didn&#039;t seem to fit the show&#039;s theme.<br />
<br />
The sound effects in Alderamin were well-rendered and often depicted their associated objects accurately; I especially liked the booms from the weapons. They were sometimes exaggerated; the sound of blood in an open wound often sounded too &#039;squishy&#039;. The voice acting was at par with the sound effects, albeit not as emotional enough. Music and sound in Alderamin seemed to shine more in the action scenes than the more dramatic ones.<br />
<br />
Alderamin is a refreshing take on the unlikely military hero &#039;subgenre&#039;; Ikta Solork is a brilliant but lazy MC with interesting quirks. He&#039;s bold but not mindless and gives his decisions a lot of thought; he loves women but isn&#039;t shy and flirts freely; he&#039;s powerful, over-powered even, but is lazy. He&#039;s teamed with a cast of somewhat generic main characters; Alderamin&#039;s strength lies not in its characters but in their relationships. Yamori is a generic female lead in a battle anime but she shares an almost telepathic relationship with the MC.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t like the lack of character development and the mostly underwhelming antagonists. I would have loved to see some of the other characters push their own motives and encounter personal conflict. I felt like the show would have fleshed out a few extra characters had there been more episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall, Alderamin is a great tactical battle show that doesn&#039;t play down core war themes. It has great art and animation and passable music and characters. It does seem like a precursor to an even better show.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
Story: 6<br />
Art: 8<br />
Sound: 6<br />
Character: 6<br />
Enjoyment: 7

    War, HUH, what is it good for?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
This is an anime about war, but set in a fantasy world. This creates some problems for me, though. The point of war stories is the fact, that war is a terrible thing, kills people and hurts the innocent. To have this happen in a setting where technically, everything is possible, as we don&#039;t know where the boundaries of this world are, heavily weakens this point. On top of that, while we are presented with the downsides of war here, stuff like Yatoris killing rampages and Iktas tactical manoeuvring are presented as cool and awesome. There is a weird

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231355">
        double message going on here, that prevents this anime from having a real identity.<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The battle scenes look pretty good, but they aren&#039;t the focus of the anime. While the character design is solid, the animation is not very fluid at times. I&#039;m sure that with a higher budget, they could have done a lot more.<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The opening, while hardly fitting the setting, was pretty good. The ending was the usual &quot;so okay it&#039;s average&quot; ending. Voice acting was pretty good to be honest, especially the main characters did a very good job.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I found the two main characters, Ikta and Yatori, to be very unlikeable. Ikta is a pretty arrogant know-it-all, who apparently is smarter than the rest of the military combined and who can do no wrong, even if he does. He also has no problems with doing things, that would make you a war criminal in real life, like burning down a civilian village or threatening to kill somebody during negotiations. Yatori is merely a puppet of the government and army. She even outright states that she would kill Ikta (a friend who is like a brother to her) if she was told to. Are those characters supposed to be our heroes? The rest of the cast is a lot better, but none of them gets enough screentime to mean something.<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
You probably guessed already, that I didn&#039;t really enjoy Alderamin much. This anime doesn&#039;t seem to know what it wants to be, a grim war story or a boring shounen or maybe a fantasy adventure? It surely isn&#039;t all of that combined, it rather switches between those. In the end, I did not feel entertained by it. It probably could have been better, but the fact remains, that it isn&#039;t.<br />
4/10<br />

Overall:<br />
5.0/10

MAL won&#039;t allow only the Haiku, so I&#039;ll put in a useless explanation that you don&#039;t need to read.<br />

Alderamin is a military show about the military genius Ikta Solork and how he becomes known as the Invincible Lazy General. Code Geass parallel comes from the relationship of Ikta with Yatori as well as the obvious military aspects of the show, but Ikta is no Lelouch. If anything, he shares more similarities with Yang Wen Li of Ginga Eiyuu/LOTGH. <br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307301">
        the adaptation chooses to relay major plot events are two great clues that it will never get a second season. It is a giant advertisement for the Alderamin light novel, and great pity that it is merely an advertisement because of how well done it is. For that reason, I cannot recommend the show as a complete story, though for those willing to watch a 4 hour ad for a light novel, this is a very entertaining one.

    In the midst of the star-studded Summer 2016 anime lineup, there&#039;s one particular show that I missed out on watching at first and that show was Alderamin On the Sky.  <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get started with the story, shall we? The story follows the adventure of Ikta Solork, a lazy and laid-back teenager together with his friends and comrades. Using his tactical brilliance, he must defend his land. Yes, the plot may not sound original, but believe me the anime executed it brilliantly. How? It lies in the characters.<br />
<br />
Ikta is not your typical male Shounen MC. In fact, he&#039;s the exact opposite of it. He&#039;s the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235035">
        kind of character you can&#039;t help but hate at first, but slowly you will root for him later on. One of the interesting aspects of the show was the dynamic or one could call it platonic, relationship between the two lead characters which is rare to find in anime nowadays. Even Yatori is not your typical, damsel in distress heroine. I won&#039;t spoil anything, but if you liked your female MC to be strong and badass, she won&#039;t disappoint. The supporting cast, though, were just so-so in terms of development. The 13 episode count didn&#039;t help either.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the animation, I would say it looked gorgeous at times, especially during the action scenes which can be bloody and violent, but overall for an anime released in 2016, it just looks average at best. I certainly didn&#039;t expect that from Madhouse, the studio that produced a large number of stunning and beautiful anime adaptation. The same goes to the soundtrack. Nothing too memorable that I can think of, even the OP and ED.<br />
<br />
Yes, it&#039;s nothing outstanding, but it certainly was an enjoyment to watch as a whole. Just don&#039;t expect anything conclusive in the end, since the LN and manga are still ongoing which is one of the reasons why I kept the overall score at a 7.<br />
<br />
Overall, I can see why a lot of people decided to skip on this show, but if you have enough time to spare, give this one a try. It may surprise you-in a good way. <br />

    It is possible to state that this anime has serious problems in pleasing the public. The sales of the material are the clearest proof that people were not pleased, mainly in view of the script, characters and technical elements. Soon though a media note on my list is still an anime not recommended.<br />
<br />
The plot is pretty predictable on everything in the initial situation involving the first three episodes, thus being expendable and short of the rest which is not very good either. In every work even when it escapes from predictability it appeals to a nonsense, childish, unsettling and unpleasant. Partly because of the elements

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267909">
        of fantasy, for example the use of &quot;spirits&quot; that do not fit the proposal, or a more serious genre that is required for it to be good, and also of the unbelievable dialogues that plays the viewer to out.<br />
<br />
From the characters since the beginning of the anime already makes a bad presentation and continues with a poor development of the same in the following episodes. These are boring, shameful conversations that make you want to give up right there in the first episode. Some fall into oblivion and others do not gain charisma or weight due as Haroma, Matthew are two featured prominently and the rest are erased.<br />
<br />
Ikta, and Yatori are lacking in progression, they do not evolve at all with the passing of the anime, beyond the military patent. Ikta is the most complicated because he is a character who does not learn, but is given the duty to teach, and does not fulfill this role. As an example the scene of Ikta cutting his own finger in pieces, what a moral, valuable and intelligent conclusion can be drawn from it. Already the Yatori is one-dimensional, bodyguard superforte who was born and will die for it, this everything, end. If one day make a list with the worst protagonists of characters of animes they deserve place in her with certainty.<br />
<br />
Technically the traits are not pleasant, with noticeable variation between the episodes, the environment is terrible, the opening is without thanks and the soundtrack is forgettable. The contrasts of colors and senarios do not match, in some moments it seems that if it is leaving Simbad the Marujo and entering the second mudila war, in others it is not in neither of which is worse. Resulting in an environment that is not believable, it is too fantastical even for a work of fantasy.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a multi-colored anime, but it&#039;s not good either. After a bad initial bow, comes a medium, but soon pauses and comes a break of climax that extends through several episodes, until a new and last conflict. The climaxes are bad for invoking solutions of amoral form conflict, without reflective call and not even do not fulfill the intention, because they do not convince in demonstrating intelligence that the narrative tries to impute to them.<br />
<br />
There is lack of depth, dilemmas, philosophy, things to make people weigh, reflect, and take an interest in the work. There would be only fighting, but fluidity and special effects are not as interesting. In short it is a very shallow and forgettable work.

    If you like story and world building his Anime fails.<br />
<br />
The setting is some sort of medieval, not quite industrialized, with some sort of magical pets that have limited use. In a good example of world building the details of how things work and what&#039;s possible would flow naturally and the reader/viewer would have some means to understand what&#039;s going on. In this case it serves as just a lazy way to pull deus ex machina out of the writers rear. The opening arc has a couple of good examples. What the characters need literally drops out of the sky for them. That can be OK

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324571">
        but it keeps on going on.<br />
<br />
Characters, the other big part of story telling and world building. Could have been good, but fail. There is good character development, it&#039;s a little cliche but enjoyable. You&#039;ve seen  them before, uncertain girl, bullied guy, loser who all manage to grow and mature. The problem is what&#039;s good about their stories, is destroyed by the two real main characters, Itka and Yatorishino. <br />
<br />
Itka and Yatorishino, man these two make you ask were they hit by a truck before reincarnating here. Itka, got the cheat ability of plot armor that makes his plans work no matter how stupid they may be. Yatorishino, is as OP as however she needs to be. Need someone to take out 20 expert swordsmen in simultaneous close combat, she&#039;s your girl. That would be fine in another genre but this one is going for &quot;realistic&quot; and every time something like that happens it breaks immersion. It&#039;s bad enough that it makes it easier to overlook the other flaws, in the story because they are just that glaring. <br />
<br />
By far the largest fail though is the story doesn&#039;t resolve. It&#039;s a lead in sigh. Another first season that needs at least two more to do the job it started to but will never finish. <br />

    This show makes a brilliant antiwar effort with some common antiwar depictions and some completely new angles on war and while it does so, it doesn&#039;t disregard war completely as the last resort for change, so big it can&#039;t be gained in any other way.<br />
<br />
Some quick information before I get completely into this review:<br />
I have not read the manga (EDIT: I have read the manga now and wrote a comparing review on the manga!) or light novel (yet), so I will rate this from the anime only perspective, while that is the case, I will talk about more than the anime when talking about the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323685">
        scope behind the anime. I will show the difference by talking about the &#039;story&#039; (meaning the story in general) or &#039;show&#039; (when talking about the anime only, without taking the bigger scope into consideration).<br />
I do this for two reasons, for one the anime does a good job, but the scope is limited by the restraints of the medium and there are points in the story when this can be seen, and two, the story feels like the introduction and ends at the start of the parent story. The second point is not as bad as it may seem, because the story that is told is quite important and without this story any follow up wouldn&#039;t make sense, and the story even makes sense with the ending point at the start of the bigger story, but it should be clear that this is only a slice of this epic.<br />
<br />
Finally, I can talk about the show.<br />
The show begins slow and rather generic, with 5 young soldier candidates going on the journey to become officers in the army, but things go wrong fast. <br />
Before I go to far we have to talk about the world. The world is quite unique. It is a low fantasy steampunk world. Every person seems to have a partner, a small spirit that seems to be semi autonomous and connected to the owner and is gifted with one element. So much about the world for now, I will dedicate a larger section to the world later because there is a lot more to explore.<br />
It has to be said that all these more or less generic sounding happenings, from the typical 5 teenager group to some later school episodes at the military academy, are never as generic as they sound. The characters act more mature than expected from these kinds of stories, the problems that get thrown at this group are not softball problems, actions have serious consequences and death, intrigue, incompetent superiors are always around the corner.<br />
<br />
What I like the most about this story is the fact that nothing seems to get forgotten. In war are not just lost lives, battle tactics, fights and injuries, but also psychological, logistical and political consequences. Even smaller things are not handwaved but explained. When the group meets a character that gathers books, I questioned if that even made sense in this world, but shortly after it is explained that the printing press was invented and books, while not cheap, are at the point to be affordable.<br />
<br />
The general story is about the aforementioned group of young adults, but as they gain influence they get subordinates and with that more and more responsibilities.<br />
Torway is a shy pretty boy and the expert gunner of the group. His philosophy is to stay as far away from the enemy as possible to minimize the risk of injury or death, but he is no coward and if he has to he will put his life on the line for his friends.<br />
Matthew is slightly overweight and a jack of all trades. He has a decent tactical mind, is a decent leader, a decent fighter, and he can hold his own in basically every field. His pride could be seen as a weakness, but he usually keeps it in check so it doesn&#039;t get in the way in important moments.<br />
Haroma is the soft-hearted healer of the group. She is shy it seems rather generic, but she proves tougher than most when required. She is not a fighter, but her work as a field medic is invaluable.<br />
Now we get to the main character duo.<br />
Yatori and Ikta are friends since childhood and complement each other perfectly.<br />
Yatori is the strict sword master that keeps Iktas lecherous personality in check. She is disciplined to the max, but she can end up in a blood rage if her hand is forced. In these moments she is less &#039;soldier&#039; and more &#039;force of nature&#039;, and she is also the source of the best fight animation in the show.<br />
Ikta on the other hand is a laid back womanizer and the brilliant tactician of the group. He is the one that can take Yatori out of her blood rage and is, through his role as a tactician, often the linchpin of the story. His laziness makes him one of the least athletic members of the group and his escapades with women can lead to some complications along the way. While he is no pushover, a soldier is still a soldier, he often bites up more than he can chew in fights and needs Yatori to bail him out of fights that are not of the mind variety.<br />
The last of the important characters is princess Chamille.<br />
The princess is something special, she is five years younger than the group and is still a child, but she is already playing the political power game to an astonishing degree. She knows what she wants and what she doesn&#039;t want, and she knows how to reach her targets.<br />
She is a fascinating character that often looms in the distance due to her status, while she still stays connected to the group, and she is one of the few characters that can surprise Ikta.<br />
This is the core cast, but there are quite some more interesting characters we get to know over the course of the show.<br />
<br />
Before I go into more specifics about the story I need to go back to the world itself, because the world is quite fascinating. The low magitech setting at the brink of the industrial revolution is quite interesting in itself, especially when we see how the spirit magic is used to enhance the specialized weapons or equipment. What makes this world even more interesting is the political and religious situation and thankfully we get quite a bit of information about those parts. Unfortunately the anime doesn&#039;t present this information quite as clear as I would&#039;ve hoped for, but the information is there, you just need to decipher it.<br />
The religions seem to be different in substance, but all are connected to the spirits as their focal point. Unfortunately that is as much as I got out of watching, because the presentation is quite chaotic and you would need multiple watches or the manga/novel to understand it better.<br />
When it comes to the political situation things get really interesting, because at that point we as viewers realize that we see this world through the lens of the bad guys. Not that our crew of people are bad, but they fight for the Empire. The Empire is not the worst country to live in, depending on whom you ask, but it doesn&#039;t allow for a lot of freedoms and is eroded by corruption. <br />
The Republic on the other hand seems a lot more free and friendly, but isn&#039;t without fault either. They take in refugees from the Empire, but also force military action and reaction from the Empire while scheming through elite forces, destabilizing the Empire through civil unrest.<br />
Those two nations are not the only nations, but they are the biggest players on the world stage.<br />
There is no real black and white here, but the Empire seems to be the worse option and the Empire is the angle us viewers are presented with.<br />
There are also war rules or something similar to human rights in this world that include treatment of the spirit partners in addition to the humans. We never learn the full rules, but it is quite interesting that something universal like this exists and is honored (for the most part) in this world.<br />
<br />
I already talked about the story quite a bit, so I will keep this short.<br />
As we follow our group of young adults through this world, the stakes get naturally raised with every obstacle overcome. The only worry of the group at the start is their own survival, later subordinates also have to be accounted for until armies are on the line. This raising of the stakes feels natural and fits in incredible well with the story, characters and world.<br />
The only problem is the typical problem of source based anime that you can sometimes feel that stuff got cut out for anime restraint reasons. It is not as distracting as in other works, but it makes me kind of curious about the source material.<br />
<br />
Some quick words about the artistic side of things before we wrap this up.<br />
The artstyle is serviceable, but nowhere near the artwork we can see on the cover of the light novel. The fights on the other hand look good or sometimes even incredible and there is not much more we could ask for in a TV series.<br />
The music is on point, but not exceptional. Opening and Ending are fun to listen to and better than most.<br />
One thing deserves special mention and that is the handling of the blood-lust scenes. The voices get drowned out and the audio meshing is very effective in delivering the feel and tone of the character involved. It may just be a small thing, but it is exceptional work for such a detail.<br />
<br />
Overall I was very surprised how well written the source material must be to allow for that much detail in world building and characters. Especially if you expect an average light novel anime you might as well be very surprised by the depth and intricacies you might find in this show.<br />
While the show has some usual light novel to animation conversion losses, which keeps it from being even better, it is still very enjoyable to watch and nearly for everyone. Just don&#039;t expect a kid friendly banter fest like other mediocre light novel adaptions.<br />

    This is an incredible series with one fatal flaw not even the Lelouch clone could foresee: there is no conclusion whatsoever. Everything in Alderamin is geared towards successive seasons but those haven&#039;t materialized and it&#039;s been almost three years; I think it&#039;s safe to assume any further plot development is resigned to largely-untranslated light novels.<br />
<br />
So, what do you get for the 13-episode time investment? <br />
<br />
A meticulous world built around unique but similar technology, believable civilizations and the space they occupy, and characters with solid motives and backgrounds who are voiced to perfection (with the exception of the Captain). Most of the technology and spirituality is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303892">
        largely unexplained, but in my opinion this was deliberate as preparation for subsequent seasons in order to not overburden the narrative with filler; to that end, it&#039;s actually to be commended as I find artistic restraint sadly rare.<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much to be said for the plot without ruining it all (and anyway, every review on here spoils it and/or repeats the summary in order to sound erudite), but it was certainly enjoyable. For those who cannot stand discarded plot strings, though, you&#039;ll be enraged at how many loose ends there are--and that&#039;s beside the fact this series ends with no meaningful tie-off.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re able to overcome that this inches closer to a future without a followup season by the day, you won&#039;t be disappointed at all. If you can&#039;t, then don&#039;t bother starting it.

    Brilliant, intriguing, captivating &amp; thrilling.<br />
<br />
I wrote an earlier review before, giving this show a solid 10. After the conclusion of this show, I&#039;m proud to say it remains unchanged.<br />
<br />
By far, this is easily one of the &#039;MUST WATCH&#039; anime of 2016. Though SHORT, but they did a great job keeping me at the edge of the seat for 13 episodes. <br />
<br />
Thank you Madhouse for another brilliant light novel adaptation.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The story grew more and more interesting as time passes by. The show doesn&#039;t feel much of a rush, taking its own sweet time to develop each characters (particularly Ikta, Yatori &amp; Chamille). Soundtrack &amp; narration wise,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230868">
        I&#039;d say it fits &amp; blends well with the show.<br />
<br />
Viewers will often find themselves at the edge of their sits wanting for more. Though the 13 episodes felt kinda short, it has demonstrated the potential that this show has. <br />
<br />
To keep it short, you WON&#039;T be disappointed by what the show has to offer but you&#039;ll be disappointed if you skip this show. <br />
<br />
Short Conclusion:<br />
- MUST WATCH Military/Action Anime of 2016<br />
- A MUST WATCH for Military enthusiast <br />
- Romance Subplot<br />
- One of the &#039;top&#039; anime of Summer 2016 (which was a dull season)<br />
- Great alternative to Action Mecha/Supernatural shows (this year&#039;s anime industry are saturated with Supernatural/Mecha action shows)<br />
- Awesome animation &amp; art! Fight-scenes will leave you at the edge of your sit<br />
- Brilliantly lazy &amp; interesting MC, with an awesome cast<br />
- Each episode will leave you wanting for more<br />
<br />
With that being said, this show goes straight into my &#039;personal favorite list of 2016&#039;.<br />
<br />
Until then, I pray for season 2 to happen.

    I&#039;ve been searching a long time for anime like this.This masterpiece is combination of filthy truth about war,great soundtracks,pretty good combination of characters and drama with 8-9/10 picture.<br />
<br />
MC is combination of laziness,great tactics mastery,satire and humanity.Decisions during the story line will be really hard and game changing.<br />
<br />
Also all supporting characters are very colorful and you will remember them for a long time<br />
<br />
Highly recommend Alderamin for guys who like dramas.Because it is war,every one can die,your favorite characters are not immortal.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy watching Alderamin,like i did when Guilty crown came up.It is very upsetting that only 13ep. is planning to be,because it would be a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233044">
        good 100+ep.project.Many characters stories are not explained and many things are in fog of war<br />
<br />
P.S Don&#039;t judge me too hard,its my first review ^.^

    War strategies, war tactics, and war. This anime strays away from the everyday plot of magic and sport and cooking and focuses on the aspect of war in this WWI-esque anime. <br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story, by any means, isn&#039;t the craziest. It&#039;s a small part of something bigger. It mostly demonstrates the MC&#039;s genius as a commander.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I personally like the art style in the anime compared to the manga. People were especially upset about the anime not looking like the manga. However, the characters look more human like, and although they&#039;re not the prettiest faces, it&#039;s a unique change from other animes. The MC in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232902">
        the manga looks like a total dope, and Yatori looks like a generic anime character.<br />
<br />
Background art and anime are standard, which is bretty gud if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The opening is really good, the ending is ok (starts off with a nice mellow piano and vocal then all this techno garbage comes on 10 seconds in). Lots a gun noises and sword slices, which is appropriate for a war anime. <br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
Like I said, the anime is apart of something bigger. It&#039;s hard to create such depth in character in 13 episodes. I mean, the whole science complex the MC has going on is pretty neat.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I really liked this anime. I&#039;d rather watch it with this art style than read it with the manga&#039;s art style, to be honest. But, this anime didn&#039;t turn heads during the summer split so I really doubt this anime will get a second season. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
It&#039;s good. Something to tide you over, unless you really like WWI-esque stuff then you should read the manga. Manga&#039;s pretty solid once you digest the manga&#039;s hideous MC.

    Alderamin was one of the animes of the season that wasn&#039;t too hyped but enjoyable to watch. Normally, I do not watch many military themed animes, but the core aspects of a genre like so definitely shows here. The characters know that war is not all fun and games and the seriousness of war is depicted throughout the episodes.<br />
<br />
The story was reasonable - two sides are at war and the MC and his friends are caught up on it. However, I have found at times not much development happens for maybe 1 episode, followed by a great combat scene in the next episode. So yeah,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231138">
        the pacing did not suffice with me. I feel like Alderamin would have shown more success if we could spread out the story to 25 episodes.<br />
<br />
Not too much complaints with the art and sound. The art style was a bit different but nothing significant or bothersome to me.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the anime. By no means is it perfect but it is definitely worth a watch. The story may be slow to pick up but I would give it a few episodes before the pacing picks up.

    Tenkyou no Alderamin it is then.Well this anime is hands down the positive surprise of the summer season and propably the best if u exclude some anime continuations (like food wards). Fantastic pace and story telling with an extremely interesting MC.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10 : The Story wraps up around Iktra Solork a guy that joined the army against his own will in a sense, and he is left with no choise but to defend his country. THe story build up is exceptional episode by episode.In my opinion Tenkyou no ALdermin is a perfect example of how u can compress an anime into 13 episodes and still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230820">
        be satisfied by it.<br />
<br />
The pace of the story its one of the biggest prons of the anime, it is exceptionally balanced and it never literally never feels rushed or slow.<br />
<br />
The use of romance/action sequences /story telling and the tactical battle is very well handled. I am specifically impressed of how well they balanced the romance in this(IKtra is a big womanizer).They used as much time as they should.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10 : Nothing exceptional here, stylistic it was fine. Could have been much betetr though. especially in the xlothing aspect<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10  top tier music. Fantastic job by inaj Keji. High quality of music  during the anime and  right use of it in pivotal moments.But the quality itself is outstanding.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10 :  that would have been a 9 if some of the characters werent a bit under-developed. That being said  IKtra Solork is one of the best and most importantly interesting MCs i&#039;ve seen in a while. He is a lazy muppet a womanizer and an exceptional tactisian. I love his calmness and his reactions(too many overractive MCs  the last seasons) he has a very specific way of perciving things and confronting them.Igsem is also interesting but is one of the characters i wanted to know more about her past since she is close.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10 overall  8/10<br />
<br />
Definitly in my opinion the pleasant surprise of this sumemr season. I enjoyed every single episode of the anime with his fantastic music very interesting MC and very solid pace.
