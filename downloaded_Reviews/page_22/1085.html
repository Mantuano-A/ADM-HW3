    It&#039;s difficult to produce a shoujo romance that doesn&#039;t feel rushed, especially within that 12 episode time crunch. With shoujo romances I like to see a nice a steady progression between the two soon to be flowering pairings. That&#039;s that&#039;s exactly what I got with Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - it&#039;s a shoujo that&#039;s not rushed. However it ends at the climax - and without a second season to wrap everything up, the first season is quite pointless.<br />
<br />
The story follows a high-schooler named Kazunari Usa as he moves into a boarding house complex, illustrating the unique blossoming relationship he has with fellow roommate, Ritsu Kawai.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150075">
        On top of that we see the connections Kazunari develops as a result from meeting his roommates. <br />
<br />
The art and sound is an area where I find this anime excels in. The sound is perfect; everything from the pedalling of the bikes to the rustling of the bed sheets when someone wakes up is heard, it’s all there. The art is quite special as well, the colours are vibrant and pleasing to the eyes. I urge everyone who has not seen this series yet to download this series, do not steam this anime. Even if you are not a downloader, just download the first episode and compare the quality to that of streaming, you will enjoy and appreciate the art more and find the anime more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Charm and loveable characters are very difficult to radiate in an anime, specifically when we get to see a board spectrum of personalities from shy-introvert Ritsu to unusual/creepy Shirosaki to dysfunctional Mayumi. Even with that said everyone in this anime unusually interacts in harmony with each other, and I&#039;m sure you will find someone from this anime that will gravitate towards you. <br />
<br />
In terms of character development, we have Ritsu as our pupil. Her development is based off the main plot of this anime, which is flowering relationship between herself and Kazunari. If I were to use the caterpillar, cocoon, butterfly analogy; I would say that Ritsu evolved from a caterpillar to a cocoon by the end of the series (watch the anime and you&#039;ll understand what I mean). Which I find perfect because it just makes the concept of love more authentic and leaves an air of mystery for the audience for what&#039;s anticipated if a sequel is produced. <br />
<br />
My enjoyment of this anime surprised me in a good way, I was going into this series expecting two people to eventually fall in love, confess to each other and by the end have their first kiss and that would be the end of this anime; just like and typical romantic comedy. To my surprise, it was the complete opposite of what I thought, you will have to watch and see I don’t want to spoil it! I will add, if you&#039;re into witty humour and stereotypical iterations between characters in a romantic comedy, this anime is right up your alley. However, if you&#039;re the type who just wants an rom-com anime where the main characters profess their love interests to each other, then you should not watch this until a sequel comes out.<br />
<br />
Love in real life takes time and work, it doesn’t happen as soon as most romance anime depict it to be. It&#039;s refreshing to see that within a short anime, the important aspects of love is not crunched into 12 episodes. Overall I loved this anime and have absolutely no complaints, if you want an authentic romance anime with some witty comedy, I’d suggest you watch Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. It just needs a second season to finalize everything. <br />

    If you’ve attended school before, chances are that you’ve gone to a library once whether it’s for studying, research, reading a good book, or just hanging out with a friend. Not unless like you’re Kazunari Usa of course, who happens to wander into the school library not by a chance to dig into a good book but rather seeing a cute girl deep in her thoughts. Seemingly set by destiny and fate, we later learn that Usa also (again by chance) happens to share the same dormitory of this girl. Her name is Ritsu Kawai and here is the enchanting story between these two characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147623">
        of your normal life. <br />
<br />
Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou (aka as The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior) based off the manga of the same name is animated by Brain Base. Coming from the premise, one should expect this to be a normal slice of life show. But what begin during the first episode isn’t as very typical as Usa encounter a local pervert named Shirosaki. Also perhaps labeling himself as a masochist, his meeting with Usa almost has him arrested. It’s a classic and inspires laughter given how much of a contrast characters with such an introductory.<br />
<br />
The story itself is simple and straightforward but shouldn’t be labeled as romance tale. Sure, we have the nice guy (Usa) meeting stoic Ritsu alone in a quiet school setting. To add to the topping, we get a clear idea that Usa falls in love with her at first sight. There’s no clear word to describe the circumstance or what illustrate such feeling as it’s pure and natural human instinct. At the same time, there’s innocence as Usa’s feelings seems to be honest, sincere, and at times childish. Perhaps the rest is because Usa’s desire to explore the world by himself after moving out of his family’s house for the first time. The catch is that Ritsu is a polar opposite of his character. Whether he likes it or not, Ritsu is in love with books rather than seeking out a boyfriend or future husband. This sets a rather peculiar instance as Usa tries to appeal to her. But looking at it from a clear angle, we notice Ritsu as a character with resilience, a girl with innate sense for literature, and difficult to articulate a conversation with. Still, that doesn’t mean Usa should give him and throw it all away because his chance with Ritsu is always at hand when they share the same dorm. The problem? Some of the other characters’ interference and even Usa’s self-worth. And while the story initially sets up of what viewers may expect, the series hardly explores romance from a dynamic angle. The “will they or not” isn’t really a question that has answers so your patience will not be rewarded.<br />
<br />
To sum it up easily, Usa isn’t exactly an appealing main character. He is just too nice and plain for a guy. And like normal guys, he fantasizes about girls in particularly Ritsu. His initial introduction shows him staring at her for several minutes in awe of her beauty and figure. It doesn’t stop there as he often deludes himself from reality and formulates various fantasies involving him and her in some sort of deceptive dreamland. Usa’s dream turns into disfigured when he realizes the lack of attention Ritsu pays to him. Its’ a rather hard counter to his desire but guys like him always try, try, and…try. And tries he does on many opportunities but the results aren’t always favorable. He isn’t exactly an opportunist and takes advantage of a certain situation though. Rather, he is honest and genuinely wants to get to know Ritsu and hopefully climb out of the friend zone. But most times, their relationship seems to be one sided. Being the bookworm that she is, Ritsu is in a fantasy world of her own surrounded by the imaginative ideas of literature while Usa is hopelessly chasing after her like a puppy in love. Throughout the show though, there are times when Ritsu realizes reality and appreciates Usa’s efforts. She sees him as an honest man who is always willing to lend a helping hand when she’s in trouble. These often extend to aiding her with a task, sticking up to her against others, and settling against her worst fears. To express sincerity, she says simple gratitudes such as “Thank You” and sometimes apologizes when she feels something she has done isn’t right. While this isn’t exactly a confession, it appeals to Usa’s confidence and makes him feel appreciative for his actions. It’s innocent, charming, and strikes out as what friends do for each other. Yes, it doesn’t qualify as a love story but it’s delightful to find how such contrasting characters can get along in the same place, the Kawai Complex.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, there are other residents there as well. And if you thought either Usa or Ritsu might be hard to get used to, then these characters will strike out as complete oddballs. From minute one they enter the story, it’s easy to see just how different they are. We have Sumiko, the dorm manager. As the oldest member of the dorm, she speaks with wisdom but also strikes fear into others with her sarcastic tone of voice when she’s in a bad mood. Being old doesn’t make her frail at all but instead presents Sumiko as a grandma to be respected. The remaining three members of the dorm includes the pervert Shirosaki whom he met before, Mayumi, and Sakaya. The latter two are lovely ladies with the looks and charm. However, they fall under the stereotypical frenzy of college girls. Everything in their mind is about dating guys and partying. This is especially true for Mayumi who is known to dating the typical “bad boys” and having terrible luck with men in general. For Sayaka, she comes off as a mischievous troublemaker. Unfortunately, almost all the dorm members becomes a subject of her trickery at some points throughout the story. In particular with Mayumi, she pours out her endearing “feelings” to the point where some might mistake her as a lesbian. It’s all fun and jokes but the show itself sometimes feels far too forceful to accompany these ideas. Some of the jokes could even be labeled as a fetish whether it’s Ritsu’s obsession for books, Mayumi’s desire to date men, or Shirosaki’s obvious masochism. Yet despite this, the show obviously makes fun of itself and appeals to life in more of a recreational form. Rather than focusing on deep relationships or often dealing with complicated drama, the show settles for a quiet atmosphere with ironic doses of energy. It successfully pulls it off without being dull with this cherry energy and credible realism. Every episode offers something new that explores real life concepts with tastes of eccentricity. A major focus on the show also deals with youth, a reason why Usa moves out of his former home and into the Kawai complex to build a new life. We see how his life progresses with these characters, and although they are depicted as uncanny in some ways can be attractive with their own appeals. <br />
<br />
As the show often likes to have fun with itself, expect plenty of comedy. The word plays and gags are all over the place including its dialogues and references. The personalities of the main characters often pokes fun of itself as well with every given opportunity. Usa, perhaps the most normal resident of the Kawai dorm, often compromises himself with situations that seems to draw unwanted attention. The trollish moments Sayaka plays off and Ritsu’s responses to what’s around are also noticeable. Even Shirosaki gets some attention with the surprising attention of a puppy love crush from a younger character. All these are called a journey towards youth through experience, just like how Usa is living his newfound life. <br />
 <br />
Essentially, the artwork will probably stand out more as a an appealing technical factor of the show. The way it presents itself feels like a dreamscape with its decorative coloring. The Makoto Shinkai vibe may hit home with its artistic visuals that is glimmering with shimmers. Texts are often incorporated to enhance the experience of youth because people likes to explore ideas, and words are a centerpiece of that. Plus, the humor it brings out is charming. Character designs are also created to illustrate how diverse they are. However, some of them are designed to look stereotypical such as Sayaka’s college girl look with makeup aesthetics or Mayumi’s “mature” body. Usa hardly stands out with anything memorable about him and while Ritsu has charm with appearance, her personality can feel dull. However, her charm can come out explicitly when she’s wearing something decorative or putting on her innocent smile with sincere gesture. On another note, the Kawai Complex dorm looks normal without any glamorous features. It looks more traditional like one of those Japanese inns you’d visit during vacation. What it does have though is a girls’ section where Ritsu’s handy dandy kendo stick lies in wait for daring members of the opposite sex…<br />
<br />
Credit to the soundtrack can be given based on two dynamics – the characters’ voices which enhances their image and the OP song which is well coordinated with imaginative coordination. For voice portrayals, Ritsu’s soft tone comes from the talents of Kana Hanazawa, well known for her work with similar characters. Mayumi and Sumiko also gets some credit for their voices to fit their characters whether they can be sarcastic or intimidating. On the other hand, Usa’s voice is dull as a rock while Sayaka has the mannerism of a fourth grader. Technical wise, the OST is moderate with some moments that are memorable when the capture the expressive responses of the characters or situation. Other times, it almost feels like it’s not even there.<br />
<br />
Take this show as a story of boyhood and girlhood. We get a diverse cast of characters in a simple story, rather than multitude layers of love polygons. It’s set in a normal setting without any explicit violence or sex. And despite some of the generic gags going on, the show is a fun experience for its energy. Don’t expect relationships to develop in ways that tell a Cinderella love story. Rather, the show tells stories about youth and growing up with others who are so different. In the Kawai Complex, that’s something to be thankful for.<br />

    Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is a good light romantic and little comedy themed anime. The story is very unoriginal, stereotypical and blatant. Nonetheless it&#039;s a good romance anime that people can enjoy watching, get a good giggle out of, and feel happy about. Of course, I love almost all romance anime, so if you don&#039;t like romance anime, then this anime probably isn&#039;t going to be that appealing to you.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the plot is very simple. It&#039;s about a high school freshman, Kazunari Usa who movies into a boarding house and it turns out that the love of his life, Ritsu Kawai is living there too.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162229">
        The story focuses on the development of the relationship between these two. Basically Ritsu loves books (a little too much), and is easily bothered/annoyed with other people, especially those that talk too much. She really doesn&#039;t show any kind of emotion towards other people, and doesn&#039;t show any sign of &quot;love&quot; towards Usa. Usa basically tries everything he has to get Ritsu to notice him, but sort of fails due to his shyness. But that&#039;s where the other fun characters who also live in the same boarding complex come into play! Mayumi Nishikino, a psychopathic, lazy, inappropriate, and drunk lady who loves to make fun of Usa for liking Ritsu, says mean things in front to Usa, but in the bigger picture, is always helping/protecting Usa. Then there&#039;s Shirosaki, a perverted masochist, whom I always pictured as a godlike figure in the anime, hehe. That&#039;s because although he acts dumb and useless, he&#039;s actually quite perceptive and awfully helpful in many ways. And last but not least, Sayaka Watanabe, a &quot;pretty&quot; girl who is actually a slut. Pretty funny character though, especially her relationship to Mayumi. All the side characters add  excitement, comedy, and enjoyment to the whole, rather slow love relationship between Usa &amp; Ritsu.<br />
<br />
The art in music in the anime were mediocre, nothing that stands out particularly. But the opening was nice to listen to; I watched/listened to the opening every episode. The voicing didn&#039;t disappoint either, each character&#039;s voice fit their personalities. The art was very lively and colorful. Very beautiful city, with beautifully drawn characters, I loved Usa and Ritsu&#039;s green hair ^o^! <br />
<br />
If you like romance comedies, then this anime is one that you might want to check out. I really enjoyed it despite it&#039;s obvious, unoriginal plot. Kind of a relaxing anime, that isn&#039;t very serious, and there&#039;s absolutely nothing scary or confusing about the anime. Such a cute and sort of innocent anime!

    Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is probably one of the top comedy animes of 2014. its a good romantic comedy, slice of life anime that will keep you wanting more at the end of every episode.<br />
<br />
the story begins with Kazunari Usa, a high school 1st year who ends up living in a boarding house due to his parents working overseas. he finds out that the girl of his dreams Kawai Ritsu, also lives in the same complex, but just when he think things are looking up,he soon realizes that his other roommates are anything but normal.<br />
<br />
The animation for Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is rather average, nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180212">
        really sticks out as good or bad. But it looks very good. I definitely applaud the character designs, they are very well-done.<br />
<br />
the characters in this anime are all really different and each have unique stories. The characters are the main focus of the show with Kazunari Usa, being your average romcom anime herione that is always too nice at times and is easy to fall in love. another main character of the anime , Kawai Ritsu, is a 2nd year high school student that spends most of her time reading books and is alone most of the time , who is also very shy and can be quite cold sometimes. Of course you have to deal with stereotypes for the most part, but they are overall a good relatable cast, which have their flaws and never feel too one sided.It&#039;s also funny how characters become more likable the further the show progresses. It is evidence of character progression.<br />
<br />
as for the music and sound of the anime, it is nothing out of the ordinary Exepct the fact that Kana Hanazawa is the voice actor for one of the main character Kawai Ritsu, which makes the anime even better.<br />
<br />
overall i think this anime has a little bit of everything school, comedy , romance and slice of life. The romance was a downer, but that was just a small part of the story so it didn&#039;t take away from the overall enjoyment. To this day, I still hope will get a second season, because it deserves one. If you&#039;re looking for an anime show with great characters,tons of comedic parts and a solid story line with a mixture of light-hearted and serious moments, then this a good watch. I was very satisfied with this, and I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t be disappointed.

    Mediocrity at best.  While it could&#039;ve been a promising anime, in reality its another anime that doesn&#039;t know what it really wants to show and if does something, its usually bad executed. <br />
<br />
The story is nothing special, or why would i give it a 5? You know when there are so many ways to make an interesting plot, anime such as this only put it simple from the very first episode and theres no further developing.<br />
<br />
The Art. Well, i don&#039;t see anything awe inspiring, moving on.<br />
<br />
The Sound is forgettable and as mediocre as this anime in general. Can&#039;t remember a single track.<br />
<br />
Characters. Now this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154053">
        is where it is going very dull. Main character is your average Joe that wants to spend his high school days with a girl and thats his only motive. No back story, no charisma whatsoever. The girl, Ritsu, is never developed fully and is just an unlikeable character. The crazy guy Shirosaki is just driving nuts considering he is plain stupid.<br />
<br />
While the romantic aspect of this anime could be called a relationship, the comedy aspect however is not there. Simply put, the humor is missing. I didn&#039;t laugh a single time, not because i don&#039;t like comedy, but because this anime and such try to much to inlcude an uninspired humor that only mentally ill people would appreciate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is one of the millions upon millions of average shows that hide the real treasures of anime.

    In my opinion, I think Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is one of the best anime of the season.  It&#039;s cute, and funny romance series.<br />
<br />
Story 7: The main plot of the story is a normal highshool boy goes off to live on his own at the &quot;Kawai Complex&quot; where it is filled with bunch of, I suppose, &quot;unique&quot; people.  He has a huge crush on one of the residents there, who is his senpai that LOVES to read books.  Although I&#039;m not a big fan of the female character being older, I guess this is a exception.  <br />
<br />
Art 9: I think the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145399">
        art is really nice.  It&#039;s really colorful and matches with the series.  I especially love the close up of the eyes, which I think the art is well drawn. <br />
<br />
Sound 7: The opening and the ending for the show is cute, and fits in very well with the series.<br />
<br />
Character 9: Oh my god.  The characters are perfect.  Thats all I can basically say.  Each character has a unique personality, and they all fit in very well.  I think the characters are what makes the series really enjoyable and funny.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9:  I really enjoy this anime, it always cheers me up :)  Like I said earlier, it is one of the best series of the season.  It is so cute and funny, I love it XD<br />
<br />
Overall 9: If you&#039;re really into lighthearted romantic comedies, you should totally watch this :D and I&#039;m really new to this site so sorry if my review sucked...

    this is gonna be short and sweet, because, well, to be honest nothing about this anime really warrants in-depth review. its pretty simple and straightforward slice of life about some eccentric characters living in a complex together, mostly focused around our MC who just moved in and quickly develops a crush on a shy bookworm who also lives there.<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
the story never really feels like it takes off, or perhaps even intended to. while we do slowly see our two romantic leads warm up to each other over the course of the series, the plot never gets very deep and there is little actual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147505">
        progress or romantic payoff. at the end of the day it feels a little like fluff.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
the art production is stellar. the color palette is beautiful, backgrounds are well drawn, shots are well framed. the visual humor is wonderful. if i had to find a gripe its that characters occasionally look a little off model. but its hardly enough to mar everything else being done expertly.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7<br />
OP and ED are catchy and fun. soundtrack is effective, but nothing too memorable or noteworthy.<br />
<br />
Character - 7<br />
our two romantic leads, while not terrible, aren&#039;t the most interesting or original either. the side characters are pretty fun and play off of each others eccentricities well. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8<br />
the humor is what really carries this show. the back and forth between all dysfunctional inhabitants of the complex are a lot of fun and had me pretty consistently laughing though out each episode.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7<br />
While the show never really got as heavy as i hoped it would, the well executed humor and art kept me excited to come back each week.

    Kazunari Usa is a Japanese high school freshman who finds himself living the dream: his parents are out on work assignment, leaving him to enjoy independent life at a boarding house where he cohabitates with his cute bookworm senpai. Unfortunately for Usa, the other tenants at the Kawai Complex prove to be anything but normal. The title &quot;Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou&quot; (&quot;We Are All From Kawai Complex&quot;) is a play on words with the double meaning &quot;We Are All Pitiful,&quot; and the residents of the Kawai Complex all exemplify this in different ways. This anime chronicles Usa&#039;s misadventures amongst this new group of vexing personalities.<br />
<br />
Kawaisou

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154019">
        falls squarely into the &quot;slice of life&quot; genre. There&#039;s no continuous plot to drag us through the series. It is episodic in nature, with each episode introducing a new stimulus for the cast to react to. Most scenarios force protagonist Usa into uncomfortable (often socially awkward or sexual) situations. This is played mainly for laughs, though sometimes we get dramatic character-building moments out of it.<br />
<br />
Usa&#039;s discomfort serves as the main source of Kawaisou&#039;s comedy, executing manzai (the straight man/funny man act), with our protagonist playing the role of straight man and the rest of the household serving as a revolving door of ridiculous antics. This can sometimes feel redundant, however. Because each of the supporting characters is, for purposes of comedy, mostly defined by a single trait exaggerated to varying degrees, it feels like we go back to the same bag of tricks a bit too often.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Kawaisou&#039;s comedy pulls from a fairly large bag. In addition to our straight man/funny man pairings involving the protagonist, the supporting cast members are also able to spin new jokes off each other&#039;s embarassing situations. This gives us a good amount of variety in gags, enough to keep things fresh even if some of the beats feel familiar. The comedy hits more often than it misses, and perhaps Kawaisou&#039;s greatest virtue is that it always moves forward at a steady clip: even when gags do fall flat, they&#039;re in-and-out before they have the chance to get too annoying.<br />
<br />
Kawaisou&#039;s comedy is enhanced by its judicious use of visuals, frequently inserting highly exaggerated and stylized artwork to great effect during gags. Apart from this, Kawaisou&#039;s visual direction maintains an idyllic vibe by constraining the bulk of the action to the Kawai Complex, allowing the show to keep a consistent color palette, which is notable for its use of contrast and bright hues. Particular attention is paid to the lighting in each scene. While the animation is passable, Kawaisou is gorgeous within each individual frame.<br />
<br />
Most of the supporting cast members start off as two-dimensional, but even as two-dimensional characters, they benefit from being unique. The cast of Kawaisou is atypical not only in the sense that its members deviate from commonly-accepted social conventions (much to the irritation of our protagonist), but also that they&#039;re able to confront problems and support one another as a family. Each of the supporting cast members also gets some dedicated time during which the series explores their character, and we get a better idea of what makes each of them tick. These different character &quot;arcs&quot; are executed to varying degrees of success, but chiefly, these arcs allow the characters to feel like people rather than props that exist solely for our protagonist to react to. Despite the relative lack of progression inherent in slice-of-life shows like Kawaisou, there is real character development.<br />
<br />
Although Kawaisou doesn&#039;t make any radical attempts to innovate within the slice of life genre, the anime is often playfully and refreshingly subversive. Kawaisou is well aware of the ways in which it could be cliche, often feinting toward that direction and misleading the audience before pulling the rug out from under them and laughing both at us and itself.<br />
<br />
For example, Usa&#039;s &quot;nice guy&quot; behavior early on causes him to take a concerted interest in reaching out to his introvert bookworm senpai, Ritsu. In the interest of &quot;rescuing&quot; her from what he perceives to be a state of loneliness, Usa cultivates a series of habits which border on stalker-like: he enters full-on appeasement mode and begins following her around doing everything he can to &quot;help&quot; her break out of her shell. Rather than reward Usa for this faux-nice behavior, numerous cast members call him out on his behavior, Usa realizes that he&#039;s being a bit nutty, and we all have a good laugh at his expense.<br />
<br />
On that note, Kawaisou&#039;s respecful depiction of Ritsu&#039;s introversion is one of the show&#039;s more impressive feats. Ritsu is far from the tree as far as the &quot;shy anime girl&quot; trope is concerned. She&#039;s not anti-social, and she does have it in her to enjoy the company of others, but she prefers to be alone with her books. Ritsu&#039;s introversion is not portrayed as a problem to be solved, but rather just one facet of her personality that makes her a bit unusual at first glance without constituting the entirety of her character. Introverts will likely be able to relate and appreciate this.<br />
<br />
Also refreshing is the fact that Kawaisou doesn&#039;t beat around the bush when it comes to topics of sexuality, while at the same time refraining from over-sexualization. All of the characters in Kawaisou are sexual beings to some degree, and in the context of the home, none of them seem particularly bashful about discussing it, with perhaps the exception of our virgin protagonist. Kawaisou doesn&#039;t use sex as a tool to titilate or arouse the audience. Rather, the sexual aspects of the various cast members serve to further illuminate and color their personalities, and Kawaisou makes it apparent that sexuality is a critical component for each of these characters. Particularly notable is Mayumi, a bitter 30-year-old office lady who is constantly struggling to find a stable man who will respect her, a goal that seems at odds with her own sexual impulses. Mayumi is also haunted by the feeling that she&#039;s past the apex of her value on the dating market, and she constantly alternates between jealousy and disdain for younger couples. While Mayumi&#039;s constant sexual conflicts are mostly played as a source of comedy, if you remove this sexual aspect of her personality, you lose the character. Kawaisou handles sexuality in a manner that is respectful while still mining it as a source of laughs.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, the relationship between &quot;nice guy&quot; protagonist Usa and introvert senpai bookworm Ritsu serves as the bread and butter of our story. The story of an overly-accomodating borderline obsessed stalker &quot;nice guy&quot; might be a massive turn-off in other contexts, but Kawaisou incorporates his behavior in a manner which is both self-aware and funny. The stoic bookworm who seldom cracks a smile might also look cliched on the surface level, but there&#039;s real joy to be found in the story that centers on the relationship between these two. That said, if you&#039;re looking for a romance story, you probably won&#039;t find it here. Rather than attempting to tell a story about love, Kawaisou tells us a story about a teenager learning to coexist with people from different walks of life.<br />

    This show was a first for me, it was the first time I read the entire manga before watching the anime. As a result, I enjoyed it far more than I would have otherwise. I now recommend always searching out a well-translated mange before watching an anime whenever possible as it adds a lot of depth to the anime. Its not like it is here in the West where the movie or show versions are adaptations and highly altered. So far, I have found that anime really strives to bring the manga to life and tell the story as richly and accurately as possible, with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181589">
        frequent nods to story and character elements that can&#039;t be covered. <br />
<br />
I watched this a while ago and am still following the anime so apologies if its a little vague. The story is a little typical with a boy at the mercy of circumstance finding himself in various flirt-prone scenarios. However, the case of well realized characters also makes this much more relatable to older audiences than most, often moving back and forth between seinen and shojo/shonen themes.  The Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou makes almost constant visual references to the manga which may go completely unnoticed if it is skipped, and is filled with great portrayals of the romance and tender &quot;youth&quot; which highlight the series. Its a great comedy romance that focuses on modest and subtle interactions between the main characters and highly extravagant interactions between everyone else.  I highly recommend it and that you seek out the manga first!

    I always love to watch this kind of show, comedy combined with romance is one of my favorite genre, and Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou has found it self a place deep inside me.<br />
<br />
A stand alone episodes is always familiar as for these kind of genre, almost no core story but even so it still attractive. As we now, if it&#039;s full comedy anime then it&#039;ll never far from unique &quot;crazy&quot; personalities from each character, and this show are &quot;loaded&quot; of that point. With all those variant &quot;unique&quot; personalities, you won&#039;t be bored even for just a second. Pervert behavior and echi content are still in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180371">
        perfect portion and enrich the entire show with a bit mature jokes.<br />
<br />
Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou was also been made with a great graphic and effect. The animation are detailed, smooth, and bright. The design of the character are simple yet appealing. All makes it so fascinating. <br />
<br />
As for the staff there&#039;s Hanazawa Kana as the MC seiyuu, Kana chan cute voice&#039;s is always lovely to hear, her experience and skill as seiyuu are nothing less expected, not to mention she also sang the theme song for it, makes me gave an extra point. <br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoy this anime very much, it&#039;s really fun watching frenzy daily life like what happened in Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, I highly recommend it for any of you who likes comedy romance.

    Every now and then when I go out of my way to look for a new romance anime to watch, I can&#039;t seem to help but to come across the whole anime &quot;3 in one 1&quot; genre package where romance comes bundle up with comedy and slice of life/school life like it&#039;s one of those 3 in 1 instant coffee packets. I mean it&#039;s not like I have anything against the two other genres but sometimes I just want to watch something purely romance just like how sometimes I just enjoy drinking coffee without sugar and creamer. But I digress, this genre bundle seems to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147977">
        be more common with animes targeted towards male audiences, rehashing cliches over and over again, building an impression that male targeted romance would not likely subsist without being comical, as to &quot;being in love&quot; is in the eyes of others, that pitiful?<br />
<br />
Enter Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou literally translated as &quot;We Are All From Dormitory Kawai&quot; or serves as a double entendre for &quot;We are all Pitiful&quot; a foreshadowing for all the word plays to come. Truly the main gimmick of the series revolves around the pitiful love endeavors of the Kawai Dormitory’s claimed abnormal inhabitants, a place oozing of RomComs juices, focusing on the main protagonist Usa Kazunari and his love-on-first-sight heroine, Kawai Ritsu. Now, I&#039;ll admit that it doesn&#039;t take much for me to set eyes and commit to an anime. Despite alarms going off saying this would be another generic RomCom just based off its synopsis, if the main heroine is short haired, well that&#039;s basically my Kryptonite. Make it a short haired girl with a dandere attitude combo, well then you might as well just bury me already. So I lunge towards the series just like how I lunge towards old ladies giving out free samples at the local supermarket. Giving the anime a shot, I thought I could at least go down with a good eye candy but in the end what I got did not disappoint me. <br />
<br />
The story while does not bring much new or innovative addition to the RomCom genre did caught my attention for having the right balance of comedy, romance and slice of life. The comedy aspect was not too overbearing as it does not take itself seriously nor try to capitalize much on the pitiful love ideals of its characters until it becomes irritating as many RomCom had done before. It had enough just enough romantic elements which in my opinion does not alienate its audiences by giving us someone like Usa, to constantly cheer for instead of the common plot-line of directly implying from the start that they could both very likely hit it off perfectly. Every now and then, interference from the other cast does not annoy me as some other RomCom does but serves only to heighten the sweet release should the two ever hit it off. The slice of life aspect of the story is executed somewhat interestingly enough even though there were scenes which are mundane due to the slow progress of the plot and/or character development. <br />
<br />
The art style pretty much within my tastes, character design had hard colours reminiscent of animation style from a couple years back but with slightly more realistic body and face proportions. Soft tones and shades for the background design compliments well with the character design giving enough contrast enabling it to stand out. The occasional anthropomorphism of characters into their chibi forms goes well with the comedic scenes, not over-employing it too much until it loses its original aesthetics. I had sound and music on a positive note as well, with an mellow opening and an upbeat ending, whereas voice actors did approvingly well with their character portrayals.  <br />
<br />
The cast of characters had the most impact on me granted the bulk of my score, ranging from a variety of different personalities, each somehow related to their somewhat pitiful love endeavors. Though considered abnormal by societal standards, to me are not we more accustomed to weird characters in the anime scene which makes completely normal people like Usa seem to be the weird one for not fitting in. While the story occasionally revolves around Usa and Kawai, the other tenants do have their fair share appearance and contribution to the series.<br />
<br />
Usa Kazunari, the protagonist, the ring leader of the handful of claimed weirdos in his life, is pretty normal you can get and this is speaking on the real world perspective, not those anime definitions of normal. He is as plain as you can get. He does things what a normal boy would do to gain attention of his love interest, which includes but not limited to, trying to get her to open up to him, picking up common interest to initiate topics for conversation and having sexual fantasies. In his position, being a junior going after a senior is pretty uncommon as far as the handful of animes I had picked up. He has trouble conveying his feelings but this is not entirely his fault when he has to deal with such a dysfunctional personality that is of his love interest. He’s the nice guy type however girls do not just fall head over heels for him. He has a predictable personality but what else can you expect from a guy who gets elated over simply seeing a different expression from Kawai. Actually scratch that, I would too, that&#039;s the perk of liking a dandere, and the net gain from the emotional difference is truly staggering. Though, Usa often pushes his luck too far, overestimating his boundaries with Kawai, taking far subtle hints and exaggerating it causing for more discomfort towards her than benefits towards him.<br />
<br />
Kawai Ritsu, the main heroine, on the other hand is very reserved with her feelings though when she gets engrossed with a book she really likes, her emotions starts leaking out. A bookworm and loner in personality, she does not mind being alone as the thought of maintaining social etiquettes with friends and acquaintances could be overbearing. Putting on a friendly persona for the benefit of her friends is emotional taxing for her as such a typical response from an introvert. Though she eventually opens up more towards her dorm-mates or &quot;tenants&quot; since her parent technically owns the dorm, particularly towards Usa but this was squandered of course by his own insecurity or interference by third parties.  She may appear stoic at times but she does have her fair share of emotional distress at times as she is unable to cope with sudden social expectations.<br />
<br />
 Shirosaki, the pervert of the dorm with his overly masochistic personality, would not be crossed out as the comic relief of the show initially. However he is caring in nature and good at tying all sorts of knots but his sexual disposition makes him hard or seemingly incapable to requite feelings of love due to the constant mocking and physical abuse of his dorm-mates. Despite this, he always comes up with entertaining ideas to kill boredom at the dorm. Often his partner in crime, Mayumi, the mature adult woman, has trouble reeling in a keeper due to implicitly implied by the other tenants as being too &quot;loose&quot; or easily swayed or charmed. She is unstable in nature, always drinking to soothe her sadness and also has a weak tolerance to other people being happy or having fun without her. Not being one to be left out, she constantly tries to top Usa by foiling his attempt at youthful love with Kawai. Though it seems sometimes she genuine does not want Usa at his chance with Kawai, Mayumi’s actions makes it all the more worthwhile by making sure he actually puts in more effort and not simply resorting to cheap tricks to get on Kawai’s good side. I would take this sort of interference any day rather than the &quot;best friend whom never get laid&quot; or &quot;harem girls&quot; interference.  Sayaka, on the other hand, with her mischievous and sadistic attitudes may appear to be most favourable among the other tenants in terms of relationship. However she herself has trouble actually committing to one and prefers to ditch them like used tampons. Similar to Kawai, Sayaka has to constantly put up a likeable persona with her male acquaintances which could also be seen literally with the amount of make-up she puts on. Surprisingly she is still a good person at heart, never abandoning her old friends even after moving to the city from the countryside. As much as she toys with Usa, she does help him out on certain occasions, though the former proved to be much more. Last but not least the caretaker of the dorm, Sumiko, who is also Kawai’s grand aunt. Kind but knowing when to get strict and threatening at times, she make sure abuses from Mayumi and Sayaka towards Usa is kept moderately. She has a special rule where she cooks the favourite meal of the tenant for the evening if the specific tenant is depressed. Even though she is elder figure, she can be playful and optimistic at times but ensures that the strict dorm rules are complied by its tenants. Now I did assume everyone in the dorm had some kind of love related issues.  Sumiko may be unmarried given she kept onto her family’s name but I could be wrong. But if this stands true I guess she has a few problems of her own when it comes to her love life.<br />
 <br />
This series was thoroughly enjoyable despite initially thinking that the mundane slice of life aspect with eclipse any redeeming comical factor the anime have to promise. In the right amount of doses with well-placed timing, I had a good laugh at their antics just like how I laugh with my real friends. They are not obligated to get to know each other in the dorm but they do so knowing they would be much more entertained putting up with each other than locking themselves in their room (though maybe Shiro would be fond the whole locking idea) Watching this series makes me feel like I too am part of Kawai Dormitory and all its weirdness. Usa despite having a very associable personality does not want to make me embody his character but merely cheer him in his often botched attempts at getting closer with Kawai. Running gags and world play galore, this show is kept going by its cast, ensuring that even a dull moment could quickly be turned into a slapstick gag. While the slow pace of the show might be unappealing to some audiences, the relationship between Usa and Kawai shows how two people with polarizing personalities should not be rush. The series may be trying to portray that it is not their weirdness that is used as common grounds that keeps them together as a unit but their ability to tolerate and overcome each other’s abnormal behaviours. This is depicted as Usa, being the epitome of weird tolerance though he at times thinks it is better to just avoid these circumstances, always seems to be drawn towards it. Pitiful as it is, seeing Usa constantly trying to run away from his fate only to return it is somewhat entertaining to me.<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell, Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou may not be ground breaking in the RomCom + SOL genre, it certainly shows that the formula is still entertaining and engaging when executed properly. I may not have gotten my pure romance experience but it does instil in me the desire to continue observing the progresses of the tenants of Kawai Dormitory. I came for the short haired girl but left with a bunch of weirdos lingering in my mind. So the questions are, “Should I recommend this anime?” “Was I satisfied with the ending?” “Am I barred from my local supermarket?”<br />
<br />
The answer is “Yes”. <br />

    	English isn&#039;t my native language - I appologize for my mistakes beforehand. I just finished watching &quot;Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou&quot; (yeah, I know, it&#039;s August and I finished watching anime from spring season... I really don&#039;t have enough free time ;| ) and decided to make a short review of it. <br />
<br />
	This show is one of those love comedies which decided to take a different approach to romance and... failed. At least in terms of that type of romance I was looking for. But let&#039;s not rush, first things first. <br />
<br />
Story <br />
<br />
	The protagonist, Kazunari Usa (though I don&#039;t remeber a single time when he wasn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156641">
        called &quot;Usa-kun&quot;), is a completely average highschooler. Starting this year he&#039;ll be living alone... or so he thought. His mother rented a room for him in Kawaisou complex which, as he quckily finds out,  is full of weird people. &quot;Accidentally&quot; among them there is Ritsu Kawai - a girl Usa had spotted (and immediately got a crush on)  in his school&#039;s library. <br />
<br />
	No, there are no sudden plot twists or surprises - the beginning really is THAT cliche. The plot centers on craz...ekhem daily life in the complex and development of protagonist and herione&#039;s reationship. As you can see the setting for the story is pretty similiar to the one in &quot;Sakuraso no Pet na Kanojo&quot;.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
	Usa&#039;s fellow residents drive this show. They&#039;re not, by any means, orginal. In fact it&#039;s the opposite, but who said that stereotypical characters can&#039;t be good? So before we proceed to descriptions of the main couple let  me tell you a bit about this crazy bunch. <br />
<br />
	Let&#039;s start with Shiro (short for Shirosaki). He&#039;s my  favourite character in this show. Well, that sounds kind of weird once you know that he&#039;s a 100% M - a masochist, who&#039;s not even trying to hide it. Obviuosly that makes him a source of many gags, but there&#039;s more to it - I&#039;d say Shiro is the most mature character - you&#039;ll see him giving advices to other people quite often. Also he&#039;s the only character who gets to have his own side story.<br />
<br />
	Next we have Mayumi and Sayaka - two girls who seem to be always fighting each other. There&#039;s not really much to say about them. Mayumi - ~30 years old, had dozens of boyfriends, but still gets easilly tricked by men; currently single, and veeery unhappy because of it. Sayaka - university student, master of deceiving and manipulating others (especially guys); in short she&#039;s so evil she could easily terrorize the devil himself. <br />
<br />
	The last but not least is Kawai Sumiko - an old lady and a governor of the Kawaisou building who treats her residents as if they were her own children. She&#039;s the only one who can stand against Sayaka and win. For most of the time she doesn&#039;t get much attention but her infinite cheerfulness and wide smile contribute greatly to creating warm atmosphere.<br />
<br />
	Now it&#039;s time for the main protagonist. I should be able to easilly relate with Usa, after all I&#039;m a highschooler myself, right? No. Nope. Just no. I do understand the cultural difference between Japan and Europe, especially when it comes to relationships between men and women, are huuuuuge.Still I find it simply impossible to relate, even just slightly, with a guy who starts blushing and getting flustered just by looking at the girl he likes, or starts crying from happiness because she showed her care for him. I&#039;m not an emotionless bastard, I think it&#039;s nothing abnormal to fell stressed when around a girl you like, but still - there are limits to everything. However, aside from that annoying behaviour I just mentioned Usa isn&#039;t a bad character. He&#039;s a  normal guy and his only trait that stands out is his ability to attract weird people. <br />
<br />
	Most of the time you see the heroine, Kawai, she&#039;ll have her nose burried in a book. She pays little attention to the rest of the world (that includes Usa). Thanks to that she developed the hard-to-approach-and-lonely-girl-aura.<br />
<br />
	However, if you&#039;re expecting cold and dignified ojou-sama with kuudere personality you&#039;d be dissapointed - she&#039;s much closer to the shy girls from a typicall shoujo manga. The main difference is that she doesn&#039;t fall for the protagonist few minutes after he appeared. In fact it&#039;s the opposite - she&#039;s stays rahter passive, even after she realizes she may have some feelings for Usa. Therefore times when she behaves more lively and active, even if she&#039;s doing something seemingly insignificant, are very precious for Usa. She also gets some adorable scenes, for example the frog costume during the water-guns battle was ridiculously adorable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Romancy-thingy&quot;<br />
<br />
	I said earlier that romance in this show is a failure. Well it depends on what you&#039;re looking for. I&#039;ve alerady mentioned this anime is similiar to &quot;Sakuraso&quot; and that also applies to romance aspect . Unfortunately if I were to give a proper explanation someone would definitely yell: &quot;Ha, look at his review! It&#039;s full of filthy spoilers!&quot;. So yeahh. What I can tell without revealing any spoilers is that there&#039;s simply too little romance in romance (geez, that sounds terrible but I really can&#039;t think of any other way to put it).<br />
<br />
Art&amp;music<br />
<br />
	The art in this show is pretty good. The colors are nice, characters&#039; faces don&#039;t look too simple and the animation is smooth. The only outstanding thing about art were shots of the Kawaisou complex from above - each with different lightning and colors used looked really good, especially the ones during sunset.<br />
As for sound... even though I just finished the show I barely remeber it. Opening, ending, OST - they were all painfully average. <br />
<br />
	So to sum up, I wouldn&#039;t recommend watching this anime unless you have enormous amounts of free time. It has major flaws but none of them are crucial enough to make this unwatchable. On the other hand if I were to name something what would make up for those mistakes I could say: characters and humor. At the beginning jokes were pretty good, escpecially the ones which were a parody of typical scenes in love comedies, but in later episodes they get weaker and repeatable. That, unfortuantely, also applies to characters (except Shiro).<br />
<br />
	In conclusion Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is just as the description of the 6/10 mark on MAL says: &quot;fine&quot;.  Nothing less, nothing more. <br />
<br />
	This review came out to be slightly longer than I thought (OK, OK, to be honest I wanted it to be half as long as it is now) and if you managed to get the end - thanks a lot! I&#039;d aprreciate any kind of support you can offer. Feel free to PM me, be it about the contents of this review or the use of language.

    When I first saw this, I thought that it would be another Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (shudders). Thank god it wasn&#039;t. I would place Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou in the top 5 anime of 2014.<br />
<br />
Story [7/10]<br />
<br />
Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is a typical romantic comedy. Most of it is set in a boarding house. You have the main character, Usa, a seemingly normal male, surrounded by &quot;weirdos&quot;. Shiro the masochist, Mayumi the woman with crappy taste in men, Sayaka the bitch (lul jk i love her), and the main character&#039;s love interest, Ritsu. All in all, it seems to be a rather overused setup. Yet,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149175">
        every week I found myself excited to watch the next episode that aired.<br />
<br />
What sets Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou from other dorm life animes is how the story is executed. It&#039;s casual. It&#039;s relaxed. Everything flows so smoothly that it seems almost natural.  It doesn&#039;t try hard to force the viewer to sympathize with the characters. Yeah, I&#039;m looking at you, Sakurasou. It&#039;s a lighthearted anime that anyone looking to relax for half an hour can enjoy. <br />
<br />
Art [8/10]<br />
<br />
My first thought when I saw the artwork was &quot;shiny&quot;. Kawaisou enjoys exaggerating the lighted areas of scenery and hair. Which isn&#039;t a bad thing. The brightness worked well with the mood of the anime. The scenery was stunning and the character art was pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Ritsu&#039;s lips were sometimes too shiny for me, though.<br />
<br />
Sound [10/10]<br />
<br />
Outstanding OP and ED. I usually don&#039;t listen to OPs and almost never listen to EDs but dang, they just made me feel so happy.<br />
<br />
Character [9/10]<br />
<br />
Although the characters are somewhat stereotypes of typical weirdos, they show signs of having more than one dimension of personality. I might have been a bit biased because I love Ritsu&#039;s character. She&#039;s a great example of a normal, everyday introvert. Her character&#039;s not done in an extreme way, where she&#039;s either some cold, heartless bitch or a supershy book reading nerd. She&#039;s normal. And that&#039;s what I think is the best part of Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. Very well done.<br />
<br />
Ritsu&#039;s laugh is also super cute.<br />
<br />
Overall [8/10]<br />
<br />
I loved this anime. It was one of the few series that I looked forward to each and every week. Watching it was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience<br />
<br />

    Why do I like this series ? NO ECCHI, NO HAREM; SIMPLE SLICE OF LIFE, SIMPLE LOVE STORY . There is not much love, but there&#039;s lots of human to human interaction and understanding of humans feelings and emotions and this is what you can expect from a slice of life story. Genuine feelings. Genuine relationships.<br />
<br />
i really liked it because ANIME is ahead of MANGA and i dearly wish to know what happened in the story hence it increased value of ANIME more into my eyes.<br />
<br />
MANGA is SETUP in very good city &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which has lot of monumetal and beautiful places and the same you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152407">
        watch in anime hence visual treat. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; KAWAHARA TOWN, GIFU .<br />
<br />
ART: it has really good art. i can compare it to 5 cm per second in many ways. SENTAI FILMWORKS licensed it and this is why it looked me familiar to 5CM PER SECOND. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;licenesed by sentai filmworks<br />
<br />
STORY: story is quite good . i find MS. RITSU CHAN quite unique and realistic and natural . USA KUN seems the usual male character but he is more wise than others as well as quite authentic. He is quite NORMAL hence attract attention.<br />
rest of the characters are those cliched usual characters . again i haven&#039;t read much of romance or comedy having cliched characters but they felt like other characters we all have seen before. still they have their own unique points and stand out and show their worth and value in the story. yes i would like to say they have their own personality and now appear slightly more different than usual characters we see.<br />
<br />
MS. KAWAI RITSU CHAN is carrying the whole show. sensible,have feelings show great expressions, beautiful, adorable,cute, talk straight to the point. care about others.innocent and pure. MS. KAWAI RITSU CHAN sooth your heart and make you feel human emotions human feelings as well as humanity again.<br />
<br />
cliche in story i haven&#039;t found much . again i can&#039;t judge much regarding this matter. i am not a fervent anime watcher . this is an episodic series where 1 thing happens in whole episode but many important life lessons you get from it. simple SLICE OF LIFE story which makes it really attractive.<br />
<br />
humour is simple and good.actually this is the ANIME that was able to make me LAUGH much more.<br />
MOST important thing that caught my eye is LOVE STORY having little romance. simple relationship building. natural expressions and feelings. PURE INNOCENT LOVE . FEELINGS grow up slowly slowly but USA KUN is ALREADY in DEEP LOVE<br />
A SWEET LOVE STORY IN DAY TO DAY LIFE .<br />
<br />
Again i am not clear about what definition people think of in case of ROMANCE. if anime reaches far enough into the manga, then you will get 2 to 3 occasions of romance. nowadays even simple interaction between characters is considered romance hence i can&#039;t say much about what people consider as romance.<br />
<br />
it has LOVE STORY . simple straight and without any cliches . you will really love both MS. RITSU CHAN AND USA KUN . you will love their relationship. now if you have watched many manga/anime series having romance you will become desperate to watch more romantic scenes as well progression in relationship. their feelings are innocent and tender and undefined hence best to watch this relationship as it is.<br />
<br />
the other thing that makes the anime stand is usage of SFX/SIDETEXT which is thrown into the anime to give us more about what characters think and saying and feel giving us more info details and help us enjoy more understand more .<br />
<br />
SOUNDTRACK : SOUND : i enjoyed both opening and ending though i liked opening more . music really goes well with story and characters and easily blend and anime much more enjoyment. now SONG lines or LYRICS are really beautiful and completely give us depiction of the story and characters. BACKGROUND music isn&#039;t loud . you can feel the music going really well with the flow of story and emotions and feelings of characters. PEACEFUL AND SOOTHING MUSIC<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT : I&#039;m really enjoying this anime. I am too much attached to this series and want to know what exactly happened in series. enjoyed each and every episode and planning to re-watch again<br />
<br />
ANIME IS COMPLETELY FOLLOWING MANGA which makes it even more worth watchable as well as enjoyable .<br />
<br />
OVERALL : I GIVE IT 10 . for such a beautiful story such a beautiful manga and making such a beautiful ANIME.<br />
<br />
ANIME IS LIVING UP TO STANDARDS AND SHINING BRIGHTLY .

    &#039;Kawai Complex&#039; is like a blend of romcom, adult jokes, anime seinen elements and wackiness. The main character Usa moves into a boarding house, whom coincidentally meets the girl of his love, Ritsu. Unfortunately the rest of the residents consist of a creepy masochist, a bodacious drunk woman and a backstabbing troublesome girl who puts a mask of cheerfulness to lead men on.<br />
<br />
Depending on your preferences, you may either like or hate the characters. But the primary focus is based on the relationship of Usa and Kana Hanaz- I mean, Ritsu; a shy, introvert girl who has a love for books and nothing else. Usa

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147865">
        on the other hand is like a kinda a semi-beta who gets constantly teased and cannot read situations for LIFE at times. Their relationship is subtle and not forceful - which is nice - however the development hates speed. It&#039;s not like a snail crossing the road; it&#039;s more like a truck in a middle of a traffic jam. Running out of petrol.<br />
<br />
This anime is primarily comedy, but it has its serious moments. And the problem is that it has difficulties deciding what it wants to be. Comedy scenes are one after another. Other comedy moments are scattered all over the place during the course of the show, which can damage its pace of development at times. There&#039;s a few moments where there&#039;s no interruption (like episode 8&#039;s scene for example), but other than that, the mood gets killed by a punchline or silly occurrence. This isn&#039;t necessarily bad in entertainment&#039;s point of view, and I can ensure you this is a comedy series at heart. It just throws more cars in the traffic jam, so when you think &#039;oh wow plot is progressing!&#039;; no, it&#039;s really not.<br />
<br />
As a comedy though, it&#039;s a pretty entertaining show. But it&#039;s not for everyone, and can bring back the bad &#039;typical Japanese humour&#039;. Lots of pervy jokes, but note this is not labeled an ecchi. It has its hot moments, but it&#039;s not immature, which is a change. The characters aren&#039;t underaged teenagers surrounded by random boobies in highschool. The ecchiness is actually justified and so the perverted, romantic or older jokes seem more natural coming from the cast suited for this type of comedy. But a lot of straight-man jokes are present, and if you&#039;re allergic to Japanese humour then avoid. It&#039;s not a big offender though, so even if your fondness of it is low, you should be safe anyway.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no typical tropes of characters like tsunderes - somewhat refreshing - but their tropes aren&#039;t really unique either. Their portrayed as what their characters are supposed to be; a drunk woman getting dumped and two-timed, whilst picking on people. A bitch messing with other guys&#039; hearts with a violent nature. And the neck-beard who gains pleasure from displeasing words and pain. They offer a variety of jokes, and they do feel alive at times, but they&#039;re not particularly pass 1-dimensional either.<br />
<br />
But enough of the side characters. Usa can be plain, but he&#039;s bearable. Even likable at times. The other times is where his thought process passes comprehension. No, he&#039;s not completely beta, but he can&#039;t read the mood, nor can he tell whether he&#039;s ticking off another person  or not. He also tends to fixates his desires way too much and this leads to behavior of density. Expressions go over his head; this can be a large annoyance to some. And honestly, I&#039;m all open to incompetent characters, but Usa continues to have the attitude of &quot;SENPAI PLEASE NOTICE ME~&quot; throughout the show. He gradually improves though, so there&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
Ritsu wasn&#039;t favoured by me that much in the beginning. The first problem was how lazy Kana Hanazawa was with this voice acting. Just another Kana. Thankfully her voice actually starts to fit her actual character, and I can indeed say it&#039;s her most fitting role. This is because Ritsu&#039;s nature is quite intriguing, well, if not for Usa&#039;s monologues of grabbing HER LOVE 24/7. Despite being an overly quiet character, she&#039;s no kuudere... most of the time. Her development is interesting in a way that he deals with situations involving other people, and the way she opens up to particular people has some depth in it as well. But alas, her developing isn&#039;t so large either, especially for being the main girl.<br />
<br />
The two MC&#039;s relationship is subtle, and it actually has some depth without shoving it in your face. But unfortunately the impact of that development is lost due to jokes and random characters interrupting every time. They overcome misunderstandings, feelings inside of them and expressions, and strengthen their bonds. It&#039;s just not very consistent when labeled as a comedy because which one is it supposed to be? Comedy or serious?<br />
<br />
And well, you can argue it&#039;s never meant to be a serious show. I can accept that, but if it really was, like a proper full-on comedy show, then all the staggering development, plot points and serious events that is cut off mid-way wouldn&#039;t be present. And it&#039;s a shame, because I think it had potential to put forward those perhaps tear-jerking scenes with its in-depth characters. But yet it probably had no potential as well due to the concept of a complex having characters filled with... complexity of strange and weird.<br />
<br />
Brains Base took very careful consideration in the animation. Lots of filters for lighting effects were crafted well, and the art is stylized and well-drawn. There&#039;s no terrible quality, due to the fact that a lot of comedy remarks goes into chibi mode. Fluid movement, but not many anyway. A lot of the voice actors do well, even in the straight-man jokes, but sometimes the two MC&#039;s sound quite lazy. OST accompanies the atmosphere well, and overall the show looks very, very lovely compared to others.<br />
<br />
Despite my criticisms, it was a thoroughly enjoyable show. It was refreshing, and at the same time it wasn&#039;t. For every unique element and positive trope it made, it took another one down. Kind of like Usa. He gets into lucky situations, only to be damned by misfortune. In the end, I didn&#039;t really know what direction this show was even supposed to take, but I can safely say the premise, characters and setting were definitely refreshing and enjoyable to watch. I just wished the show had the ability to blend in both its funny and serious moments, instead of staggering them here and there.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if you aren&#039;t bothered with presented plot elements that are hardly fleshed out properly, then check this out for an amusing romance comedy.

    Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou a anime about a random group of people living together while exploring romance.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story is easily the weakest part of the show but not in a bad way just compared to other parts, as it is well done for a slice of life comedy romance with a SLOW developing romance which could have been fully developed if it was longer like 25 episodes instead of 12 and aside rom the romance the show is just made up of funny moments and cute scenes.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The art of Bokura was very nicely done as it had good detail in aspects both in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147835">
        characters and scenery which was used for the main animation but it does change to Chibi every now and again but is mainly used for funny scenes which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The opening and ending of the show are very similar and nice to listen so must that I never skipped them over the 12 episodes as well as fit into the nice and happy slice of life genre.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
The characters of Bokura all feel quite unique in there own way and fit nicely into the show except from Usai who is too generic as he is the typical overly nice guy who never snaps but aside from that they all feel special in their own way and not just the main characters even the supports are remember able and fun and will make more than one appearance.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I loved this anime as it was warm kind-hearted one that made me feel better after watching every episode. I enjoyed the comedy and heart touching romance. Needs a second season.<br />

    Its capturing the viewer with its special story. Of course the story progress slowly but the reason why is that it gives you time to think of how it will maybe progress and the characters are very unique to the story. The art is amazing and beautiful. Even the voice actors are a perfect match for the character. It may become slightly less interesting in the middle of the story but it gets more amusing afterwards. If you already have watched it before you are going to want to watch it again.

    When you look at this anime, your first though most likely is &quot;What sets this anime apart from all the other&#039;s.&quot; I&#039;m here to tell you what that is, and why you should watch this masterpiece of a show.<br />
<br />
First of all, don&#039;t you hate those shows that try so hard to be something there not. Thankfully, Kawai complex isn&#039;t one of them. This show new exactly what it wanted to be and it did it in full swing. <br />
<br />
The characters are all different in their own way, and the show just wouldn&#039;t have been the same if any one of them weren&#039;t there. They were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149117">
        portrayed exactly how they were meant to be, and they never changed throughout the show. <br />
<br />
The relationship&#039;s throughout the show were developed beautifully. Whether it be dealing with friendship, or romance. They were all handled amazingly. In my personal opinion, the relationship developed between Ritsu and Usa was probably the darn near cutest thing I have ever experienced in my life. I&#039;ve seen close to every single romance anime ever made, but there relationship top&#039;s the charts for me.<br />
<br />
The story is pretty basic and the plot...well I&#039;m not really sure If there even is a plot. The show is basically about Usa learning more about Ritsu and here loner personality. He wants to help her, but he isn&#039;t really sure how. <br />
However, don&#039;t think that made the show boring by any means. The process by which Usa learned more about Ritsu was done in such a real way, yet at the same time it was more touching and heartfelt than anything i have seen in a long time. Usa went to such extreme lengths to be there for Ritsu, yet he knew when to keep his distance when need be.<br />
<br />
The animation is beautiful...need I say more. The use of colorful screentones was used quite heavily in this show. It gave it a more simplified look, Yet the realistic style of the character&#039;s balance that out. Each character stands out in their appearance as well as their personality.<br />
<br />
All in all. Kawai complex is a top-notch RomCom anime that I would recommend to anyone. even the people that aren&#039;t into that genre. So stop reading this review and go watch it already. Oh and FYI, Ritsu is the cutest anime character ever. I&#039;m sorry Taiga, I love you, but you have just been surpassed.

    Okay, this is my first review &gt;&lt; so please excuse me if it isn&#039;t good, btw I will only do reviews on animes that I enjoy. I just finished Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, it was splendid. I loved how the characters progressed like how at the beginning Kawai barley even talked to Usa but as time went on they slowly began to talk more and the love story took air. This anime had a lot of funny moments, which made this a great experience. I specially enjoyed how Kawai got jealous, when Usa&#039;s former middle school classmate appeared. For me Shirosaki was one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189163">
        most enjoyable characters, he was unique. The art was nice, it was quite colorful and changed depending on the aura of the characters. I didn&#039;t really focus on the sound but it gave a massive effect on the anime. All the characters were great, mainly how Usa didn&#039;t notice that Kawai was falling for him. The supporting characters were the main reason Usa got closer to her. I must&#039;ve spoiled a lot. oops. I enjoyed this anime but one thing that ticked me off was that they never actually kissed. I hate when romance animes do this. In conclusion, it was very good. <br />

    Bokura Wa Minna Kawaisou is one of the animes that I was looking forward to in this spring 2014 season<br />
<br />
Even though the anime certainly doesn&#039;t have anything that is ground breaking, it certainly delivers what it is expected of it and it is certainly not a bad thing.<br />
<br />
STORY 7/10<br />
Kawaisou tells us a story about Usa Kazunari, a boy who will start living on an apartment complex called kawaisou, coincidentally an upperclassmen who he fell in love on first sight also lives there. Of course things aren&#039;t gonna be easy as Usa has to deal with the other residences and their odd behaviours. The story premise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149537">
        certainly doesn&#039;t sound exciting and there is a lot of pitfalls that can make this kind of story to be stagnant. But fortunately, the execution of the story and the dynamic of the characters brings a big help in creating a fun and enjoyable story, the romance are subtle but is sweet enough to make you go &quot;aww&quot; and the comedy is well thought out and again I can&#039;t stress this enough, executed perfectly (if not very well). Not to give spoilers, but I do feel that more episodes would have helped with the story as I feel that the endings are rushed and not satisfactory.<br />
<br />
ART 7/10<br />
The art style of Kawaisou is not great and to be honest, I am not a big fan of it since I prefer a more &quot;moe&quot; kind of art style but that is just my general preference. With that said the art style is not bad and I enjoyed how it sort of compliments the comedy. Some scenes are drawn beautifully while some scene made me think &quot;uuhh this is a bit jagged.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOUND 8/10<br />
I love the opening of Kawaisou and while it does not have any soundtrack that is memorable it certainly has a nice background music, the music are appropriate for the situation and serve as a nice mood maker for some of the sadder or romantic scene<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 9/10<br />
This is where Kawaisou excels at, every character is well thought out and brings a certain dynamic to the story. What makes this type of genre so good is that you feel a certain relatedness to the character and Kawaisou has more or less done that, Usa the main protagonist is your main archetype of &quot;nice&quot; guy but it is not generally a bad thing when it is executed in a right way. He doesn&#039;t feel bland or boring and you can feel that he has a &quot;personality&quot; and that is a big praise for someone with that archetype. Another thing that I like is how the anime explores the other character traits and personality as a whole and you grow to love the anime not just because a few characters but everyone as a whole. The character development is also one of the better aspects of the anime, Usa is first shown as unwilling to open up to the other residences but as episodes past, you can feel that he shows more care to the other characters not just the main heroine. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 9/10<br />
I enjoyed kawaisou, it is not something exciting or dramatic. But it is the pure essence of a romcom slice of life, it shows us how a group of characters interact and grow together, I feel a general sense od relatedness to the character and that is a huge deal for not this kind of genre but every genre as a whole, an anime can have a crisis that deals with the destruction of the world but you won&#039;t feel any urgency if the anime cannot make you relate to the characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL 8/10<br />
All things considered Kawaisou is a good anime if you want to find something that is relaxing, the romance might not be very showy but it has it&#039;s subtle moments which makes it worthwhile if you are only looking for something romantic. Granted it is not perfect with a rush storyline and some episodes does make you feel bored, but it is a rewarding experience and I am glad that it lives up (or gives more) to my expectation. I still want a season 2 though.<br />
