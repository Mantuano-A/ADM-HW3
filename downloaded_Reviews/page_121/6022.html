    My opinion: <br />
Clichefest merged with shitfest. <br />
For most of the duration of this show I was in a self-induced comatose state as a defense mechanism against the utter stupidity of the show.<br />
Fuuka is one of the most forced drama series I have ever seen and it was a painfully generic and cliched show to watch. Fuuka is one of the worst excuses for media-entertainment that I&#039;ve ever seen and this is no exaggeration. My reaction after finishing its 12 dreadful episodes is one of repulsion, disgust, and pure anger. <br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
I do not seek to offend anyone but this show’s plot seems to be written

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243367">
        in the image of a teenager’s sexual fantasies, following a juvenile course that I often found irritating.<br />
The story revolves around the unusual girl, Fuuka, and a new shy transfer student, Yuu Haruna and the popular singer Koyuki Hinashi. This plot is not just utterly generic but also filled with holes, conveniences, cringe worthy lines, it is cliched to the point that cliches form a large part of the story, it is poorly paced and poorly constructed with a poor execution.<br />
<br />
From the very beginning of this show I had the feeling it was going to be bad, very bad. <br />
In the first few minutes we see a forced and cliche scene where Fuuka runs into Yuu and both of them end up in an awkward and embarrassing situation where Yuu is accused of taking pictures of Fuuka’s underwear. Next thing we see is Fuuka smashing Yuu’s phone and then running off, where the f is she running to?... Never mind that, the following day Fuuka invites Yuu, who she a few days before accused of being a complete pervert, to a very requested concert… getting past the imbecilic story-line, where does Fuuka get her money from to be able to throw around front-row tickets to a popular concert. From here on, Yuu and Fuuka will grow closer through numerous plot conveniences and cliche scenes.<br />
<br />
There are so many unbelievable coincidences and imbecilic actions to the point you lose track of their number, they just keep coming, being shot at the show with a machine gun. <br />
For instance, we have members from the famous band “Hedgehogs” being school staff (what’s the chance of that?) but huge Hedgehogs fans can&#039;t recognize a single member from their favorite band. The protagonists just end up working over the summer with a member of that same famous band as their boss; the girl that ran into the male lead turns out to be in his class, etc. <br />
In one episode, far from the beach, Yuu almost drowns trying to save Fuuka from drowning and then he is showed on the beach being resuscitated by Fuuka, through the mouth-to-mouth method (cliche). How the heck did Fuuka mannage to carry the unconscious Yuu back to the beach before he died? <br />
That’s a shitload of hard to believe coincidences and actions.<br />
<br />
<br />
For a music show this is very poorly done. Apparently it is very easy to play musical instruments, you just need to be briefly told how to do it, no practice needed and you just need to be a random girl who sings in the shower in order to be a good cover artist and vocalist. <br />
This show is offensive to real artists and the work they put in… these few students start playing a song without knowing the notes or the song itself, their instruments or even which instrument they would like to play and succeed in playing that song. Planning to create a new song? Fuuka will compose it in two days. Oh, just give me a break!<br />
&quot;Here, Yuu-kun, you&#039;ll play bass while we see if Fuuka&#039;s got talent because reasons!&quot; - just another imbecilic course of action.<br />
<br />
The drama is made up of plot conveniences that are thrown together forming a complete mess and not only that but it is one of the most forced and cliche I have ever seen. We have the generic “misunderstanding” between characters that stretch out over 1-3 episodes only to be solved with two words, poorly done drama.<br />
Of course, we have a cliche love triangle made up by Fuuka, Yuu and the childhood friend, Koyuki. This drama failed before it began, I already knew Koyuki will lose based on her shallow and dull personality, not only did the love triangle drama fail but it failed miserably.<br />
<br />
Next on the list: Ecchi scenes. The ecchi scenes are so forced that they insult my intelligence. <br />
How the hell does Yuu pulling his jacket off Fuuka result in Fuuka with her arms out of the jacket and up, her shirt pulled halfway up her chest and his hand under her shirt? <br />
Jackets do not work that way, falling does not work that way. There is no way this “accident” could happen. You can&#039;t accidentally turn away from somebody wearing the same jacket, accidentally pull them underneath you and then also accidentally pull up their shirt and fondle their tits.<br />
This is levels beyond the dumb anime logic I am used to, it makes an art out of being an idiotic show. I can suspend disbelief but now you are asking the impossible! And what the fck is up with the “sisters” that are always half-naked?<br />
<br />
The plot is predictable and all the twists are predictable, once a character is introduced you already know how it will end up, removing any potential tension that may intrigue the viewer.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
The characters are generic, cliche, one-dimensional (absolutely no development), poorly built and ultimately hollow having no real personality. These characters live in the bullshit land too.<br />
<br />
The male protagonist, Yuu Haruna is a generic run-of-the-mill, dense high-schooler who keeps getting into perverted and embarrassing situations over and over again and later not understand what&#039;s going on.<br />
He is also unable to properly share his thoughts with other characters, especially Fuuka, therefore creating cheap drama and a state of confusion. <br />
When faced with an obstacle he adopts the generic “I’ll do my best” mentality and through plot convenience he will achieve his goal.<br />
In the very first episode we can see the excellent patience and kindness of the main character. Within just two days,Yuu gets his precious phone broken twice by the same woman. Normally, I would have been infuriated by this woman&#039;s actions, oozing with rage. But does our protagonist falter? No, he calmly just pays up several hundred dollars without protest or resentment. The story of our protagonist&#039;s kindness does not end here, no, no. See, the woman who broke his phone, twice, that is two fking times, did not ever compensate or apologize in the slightest for her actions, but luckily for her, our protagonist is a kind and patient man. Because he was such a gentleman, he took the lady out on a date to her favorite movie! How wonderful and kind!<br />
Enough with the jokes, Yuu is a shit character.<br />
He is shy, kind and introverted. That’s all I could get from him.<br />
<br />
Fuuka is a difficult character to decipher because of how poorly she is constructed, one moment she acts defensive and violent and next she acts cuddly and romantic so I am left here wondering what the hell is going on with her. <br />
Fuuka is the generic “strange” girl that stands out through her cheerful and free-willed personality, she has numerous mood swings and oftens jumps to conclusions creating even more cheap drama. <br />
She once saw Yuu with his childhood friend and jumped straight to the conclusion that this friend is Yuu’s girlfriend. After she runs away (cliche), Yuu tries to talk to her and to apologize (for what exactly?) but she gives him the cold shoulder until she punches him saying “baka” in a generic tsundere voice, giving me a cringe-worthy memory.<br />
Is Fuuka a female Naruto? She gets everyone to be her friend and follow her lead, if it’s creating a band or going to work, her friends will follow her lead.<br />
She claims to have never been in love only to later figure out she “loves” Yuu. Oh, give me a fking break! Can this get any more cliche?<br />
<br />
The other characters have zero, I mean 0 personality or development and are utterly forgettable. <br />
There is Makoto, the blonde gay guy who says lines like “I saw a really hot lifeguard, gonna go and try to land a date” who’s only trait is being gay, there is Nachi who is just there, and there is Sara, ah, I already forgot what she was like.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics: 7/10<br />
The animation&amp;art for this show is good at best. It is mostly fluid but has considerable flaws with the character design of adults, they look like teenagers as well with some of the backgrounds. While the animation is mostly fluid it does have moments when it feels laggard.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
Did I see a “music” tag? This show fails in the sound department.<br />
The opening theme is atrocious, painful to listen to and the ending theme is also bad but I didn’t mind it that much mostly because I didn’t concern myself with skipping it. The voice actors did a decent job but not spectacular in any way. <br />
In the end, the sound was really disappointing, having bad opening/ending themes and mediocre songs as an OST.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
Whenever I wasn’t completely annoyed, I laughed at the show, not at the jokes but at how bad it was and the number of ways it failed. This show is a joke, that’s the only excuse I can find for it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
Fuuka, a show featuring a bad plot accompanied by poor characters coming in a package with mediocre animation and sound. I recommend skipping Fuuka and never looking back at it.

    Synopsis<br />
Yuu Haruna just moved into town and loves to use Twitter. Out on his way to buy dinner, he bumps into a mysterious girl, Fuuka Akitsuki, who breaks his phone thinking he was trying to take a picture of her panties. How will his new life change now?<br />
<br />
Fuck.<br />
<br />
Story: 4, generic hareming it up into a light music band. Nothing original in concept. However, the plot moves a fucking mile a minute - bad anime misunderstanding that stretch out into 1-3 whole episodes in other shows get fucking slammed into 6 minutes and are done with, whether the characters really should be over them or not.<br />
<br />
Art:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239261">
        4, looks decent but has absurd, erroneous cinematography issues. MC&#039;s phone gets thrown in a bush so he searches the same spot in a bush for 8 seconds. A boy in a sweatshirt during episode 4 stands up in an up and to the right maneuver, which somehow results in him flipping 540 degrees, putting the sweatshirt fully back on, and grabbing a girl&#039;s midriff.<br />
 <br />
Sound: 6, yeah, sounds fine, except for whenever someone gets slapped by a male and it shatters their bones and the sound barrier.<br />
<br />
Character: 2, dear god, what? Character motivations for being into the MC stand on barely any ground or none at all. Side characters show some spirit, but a lack of human logic.<br />
 <br />
The main character&#039;s a bland shy baby that the girls like for no reason.<br />
Fuuka is an enjoyably enthusiastic character but she&#039;s insane - shatters his phone one day, asks to see the picture the next. Super sensitive about her panties for the opening plot point, but then hangs her ass in front of the MC&#039;s face in a swimsuit without any concerns at all for minutes on end (her end am I right? Ba dum chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I&#039;m so alone). Characters act inconsistently in this show if it&#039;ll move the plot points along.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Honestly, 10. This is where the big money is. I&#039;m having an amazing time riffing on this hot garbage with some friends and the experiences you have in life are all you have in life before you die and pass away and it&#039;s a good chuckle fest of laughing our asses off between the inconsistent characters, inconsistent editing and logicless mise en scène found in some scenes.<br />
<br />
Watch this if you consider yourself a pseudo-intellectual and like to riff on anime with friends. <br />
<br />
This quickly written review with a few holes in it brought to you by the fact that I couldn&#039;t just paste (from the synopsis, the bare minimum effort to characterize our blank slate MC) &quot;Yuu Haruna just moved into town and loves to use Twitter&quot; and the word &quot;Fuck&quot; and call it a day.

    Through all the shitty fanservice shows and idol/music anime airing for this season, the two categories overlapped at this show.....Only it&#039;s mostly music and barely fanservice. This was not the best.<br />
<br />
 First off, this show was one of the WORST dramas I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. It&#039;s so forced and the pacing of everything is terrible. Everything is forced i this show. Someone will say something then infer the exact opposite or take something personally that wasn&#039;t directed towards them.The pacing could not be any worse. One event will happen right after the other and then they&#039;ll get distracted and go on to something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238725">
        else entirely. (Also their &quot;problems&quot; are always solved within one episode.) The &quot;drama&quot; is just a bunch of plot conveniences and a stupid love triangle that makes no sense in the first place. The love triangle consists of Yukka(I think that&#039;s his name), Fuuka, and Koyuki. Only problem is that Yukka shows in one of the very first episodes to be more committed to Fuuka, than Koyuki and he does it time and time again showing he&#039;s more committed to Fuuka. This shows that it is unnecessary to even consider Koyuki an option, But for the sake of forced drama........<br />
<br />
The charaters in this show are so bland. Starting with Yukka, he is the most boring. We all know that he is a stick in the mud,and he is antisocial??? That was all I could get from him. The blonde one is basically there just to clear up any &quot;drama&quot; between Yukka and Fuuka. Finally Fuuka,she is maybe the most interesting out of all of them. She likes to sing, she jumps to a lot of conclusions, and wants to make her own decisions. Fuuka never really goes beyond her character. She stays consistent with jumping to conclusions singing, and talking about bands, or wanting to start hers.<br />
<br />
The art for this show is good at best. At times it&#039;s inconsistant and almost jarring to even look at. It&#039;s color scheme it has is very cool, to which I have to commend them for. They made it so that the colors flow smoothly but the focus is still obvious.  It&#039;s character designs are good-looking, but like had said, it&#039;s almost jarring to look at them when they gook so off model with them.<br />
<br />
Overall I was neutral to this show it was boring to be honest and the only things keeping me hooked were the opening song and fanservice. That can only get you so far though....<br />

    I haven&#039;t watched many &quot;Romance&quot; type of anime but this one seems to be really great! <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve watched 4 episodes so far and i can say im enjoying it! Fuuka, the main character, in my eyes is a person who doesn&#039;t afraid to take risks in her life but she is also too guarded and secretive. <br />
<br />
However the anime has suspense and it&#039;s being a little bit rushy at the beginning which makes you wonder, what it will become at the next episode? How things will end up now? So i see it as a positive thing! <br />
<br />
The art is magnificent and everything looks so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238692">
        realistic to me! It perfectly fits with the story and some backgrounds were outstanding! <br />
<br />
The characters are all mixed up i&#039;ll say. Like our society, they are a variety of characters that they have different personalities, weaknesses and strengths but there is always a balance in between! They are all acting so realistic which satisfies me enough to not skip the anime!<br />
<br />
I am really enjoying the series, my overall score (by far) it&#039;s an 8 and if i&#039;ll enjoy it even more at the end i might give it a 9! The show is good i&#039;ll gladly recommend it to those who love Music and Romance type of anime!<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
OK... So HERE is what truly happened to Fuuka.<br />
<br />
Why is the manga 7,5 and this anime much more lower rated 6,6 and also &quot;hated&quot; by some other people.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes were like allright everything was going according to plan all just to reach a certain point in which in the manga actually made the story good, but in the anime they decided to throw all of it away.<br />
<br />
*SPOILER ALEERT*<br />
<br />
[spoiler]<br />
In the manga Truck-kun comes and sends Fuuka to isekai(not really she just dies) and then the protagonist becomes all depressive on how he could&#039;ve saved her and how he lost THE LOVE

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340417">
        OF HIS LIFE, other girls jump onto him later tho. ON THE OTHER HAND the anime decided to go on steins;gate timeline not some deviated shitty timeline where for some reason his lover goes to &quot;isekai&quot;, BUT GUESS WHAT! &quot;The death of fuuka that actually made the Story good and how the protagonist deals with her death were just like MEH lets throw all of it in the trash&quot; - So the producers thought.<br />
I was Legit watching the anime Till I reached TRUCK-KUN scene, but then she escaped death And I was like &quot;IS this really Fuuka?????&quot; wtf happened to the original plotline. Then it went like &quot;aight&quot; she didn&#039;t dieded and the story took a whole other route<br />
[/spoiler].<br />
<br />
*END OF THE SPOILER*<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong The Plot of this anime was already average/good on the manga, but they just decided to take a bit of Pity on the Protagonist, after What happened to him in the original plot, and this actually took out the one thing about this show that made it different from many others.<br />
<br />
IN Summary: Read the manga if you want Depression Plotline <br />
OR<br />
See the anime if you want Average Plotline

    So I saw that this anime had a not of negative reviews, but life&#039;s too short to hate things, so I decided to make this review to touch on the parts that I found great and where it could have done better.<br />
First of All, this anime is a music/romance anime, at first I thought it was a weird combination, but i felt like it actually worked really well. It&#039;s also a music anime which you don&#039;t need to be ashamed of if any of your parents catch you watching it (No stages full of girls doing cringy cut/paste dancing in horrible fps). So the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270686">
        starts off weird, i personally did not enjoy the first episode as much as the others as i felt like the meeting of the characters was completely unnatural and felt a little forced. Regardless, the characters develop a friendship in the first episode despite their rocky beginnings. The more episodes I watched, the more I actually enjoyed. <br />
Fuuka is a sweet, adorable girl with a passion for music, and is incredibly friendly, and cares deeply about her friends. She is shy, and unexperienced with love, and likewise with Yuu, so their characters are quite cute as they eventually develop feelings for one another despite Yuu and Fuuka have a slight speedbump in their relationship, allowing for them to discover what the other means to them.<br />
On to the music side of things, the sense of time in this anime is a little weird being honest, like at times it skips days,weeks, months which i personally feel works with this anime, as it saves having montages of characters developing their skills. The anime did make it seem like learning an instrument and making a song is childs play, which we all know for a fact that its quite the opposite. The first song the band learns is Climbers high by a band in the anime called Hedgehogs (whom also play a vital role in the development of the music),  and the song was played at the schools culture festival which had a shaking start, but as the band began playing, the crowd warmed up to them and it was a great success. I have no clue why, but when the band was playing and having a great time, I was always getting goosebumps while watching it, i guess I was so happy for everyone. <br />
Anyways, im sick of writing a review so imma just say again that lifes too short to hate things, watch an anime and look for the things you enjoyed about it, and not the things you didnt.

    Will you watch a series that dropped from 7.5 to 7.07 after the last episodes?? The mediocre meter measured a change of 0.43, in other words, the ending and the last minute changes destroyed the animation. It is boring and mediocre. We want to block it in our memory next to Bing Bong. Usually, a series will rise in the last chapters, but Fuuka is one exception let me correct that, 2017 winter season deception. <br />
<br />
No matter if you follow the manga or not, you will feel that they took the wrong direction. We can&#039;t call the anime an adaptation because it is a side

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243359">
        story. <br />
<br />
The animation had potential, but the developments killed any chance of seeing a good narrative. The pacing is horrible. The characters aren&#039;t well developed. In this fantastic world, you can be a musician using the 24 hours magical training, and you will get a studio record contract after playing a school fair and a single club concert guaranteed, no hard training needed. <br />
<br />
The main characters are different in the manga. For example, imagine Vegeta. In the manga, he is arrogant, self- entitled and ruthless, but now we take him into the animation and change him as the lover of all the living creatures. It is like seeing a dog eating cat food and meowing.<br />
<br />
You can&#039;t explain why they focus several episodes on some characters if they were planning to trash them. The drama is forced. The romance is weird, from nowhere the characters start loving each other. Their actions and decisions lack background because the story isn&#039;t well developed. <br />
<br />
There is a big crater in the story, details that you can&#039;t explain or aren&#039;t needed for the new thing. Even if they wanted to change the story from the manga, they shouldn&#039;t tease the watchers with details from the manga (street lights). There were better solutions than this aberration, and we could have enjoyed it more. <br />
<br />
But not everything is bad. There are some cameos with Suzuka if you are a follower of that story. The art is fine, and the music is good. I am wondering if the main idea of the adaptation was selling the songs because selling the episodes is going to be a pain. <br />
<br />
Finally, if you want to spend some fun time, perhaps you should pick other animation, you could feel disappointed after watching this. My score is 5.0, I saw Suzuka, but I wanted to see this animated in a different way. All these decisions killed any opportunity for a second season<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s give this adaptation some awards (for more info read my profile). I will give this the Picard&#039;s Facepalm Award; the School Days give me other ending Award and the Sakura Haruno Character Award.

    ♦Why I think &#039;Fuuka&#039; deserves a better rating ♦ |||NO SPOILERS|||<br />
<br />
Not that I&#039;m an otaku but I have been watching a lot of animes. Personally, my favourite are animes about magic (lots of fantasy basicly) so any other must really try hard to get my attention.<br />
<br />
What drew my attention was the energy of the main character Fuuka, I tend to be alike a little (hehe). So it kind of swept me on board this anime and I continued watching. Whether you believe me or not, I really thought it would end different. You know what I mean I don&#039;t have to spoiler. But the fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269916">
        that it didn&#039;t, maybe I liked that even more. It was more honest this way, no matter how hard the truth can be.<br />
<br />
I liked the pace of the anime, from time to time you hear them say &#039;it&#039;s been x weeks&#039; so you know time is really passing by fast and you&#039;re only seeing the important parts. (Like you know, even in soap series you don&#039;t see everything like every toilet visit for instance.) They could have made this a 24 episodes anime but I like it better this way, it showed us what it wanted to show and no unnecessarily information to fill it up. <br />
<br />
The art work is also great, I just can&#039;t stand to watch those old or bad quality animes. (sorry) Art work is really important for me because it brings the emotions out better.<br />
<br />
Sound was great, I love how we actually heard their songs. (instead of skipping that part because of expenses) But also their practices and everything in between. <br />
<br />
It bothered me a little how long it took them to realize who was in love with who. But I guess even if that wasn&#039;t the problem, it&#039;s still not easy. Being in love that is. But besides that, there were also characters who seemed to know exactly what was going on and I wish them the best. ♥☺ <br />
<br />
Overall I really liked this anime ( I didn&#039;t cry!... I didn&#039;t!!)<br />
<br />
So I&#039;d definitely recommend it!

    (This review may have spoilers. I said &quot;May&quot;because truck-sama is pretty famous)<br />
<br />
Edit: Episode 5 and truck-sama hasn&#039;t appeared.<br />
Waiting.<br />
<br />
Fuuka, by the author of A town where you rage, he knows how to make his fans rage like a god. And in Fuuka is the same. Characters? The only good one is maybe Fuuka or Sara and I said, MAYBE. But this guy likes plot twists so, spoiler ahead, he killed Fuuka using truck-sama . Well, he is going to kill Fuuka again in the anime. And the rest of the cast is filler. The gay one, the childhood friend that is in love of the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239264">
        guy, the other one that god knows who is him but he plays the drums and Sara, the typical cold but later warm girl (atleast, she is cute). <br />
<br />
The ecchi is no sense. Or maybe, the skirts in Japan are so fucking short that you can easily see the panties of any girl wearing them. Btw, Fuuka is a little bit crazy. I mean, she broke the phone of a guy twice without any proof. Well, not only Fuuka but also nearly every main is retard. In the manga they dropped out high school like YOLO and only the gay one is the only one that graduated. <br />
<br />
Another spoiler ahead. Later the author makes another Fuuka,then, is pretty much the same when It was with Fuuka 1. And surprise, the father of Fuuka 2 was truck-sama&#039;s driver. <br />
<br />
The romance and drama and shit are forced like a rape. Even the love between an otaku and a dakimakura feel more real.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure this review I&#039;m writing is easily the resume of the anime.<br />
Don&#039;t watch this shit. Go watch Pokemon, the plot is much better. <br />
<br />
English isn&#039;t my mother language, sorry for the mistakes.

    I have literally created a MAL account just so I could write this review. <br />
<br />
Fuuka is one of the worst excuses for media that I&#039;ve ever seen in my life, and this is no exageration. My reaction after finishing its (currently) 9 dreadful episodes is one of repulsion, disgust, and pure anger. This anime does everything wrong and then some, but let&#039;s start with the basics.<br />
<br />
The story is stupid and unfocused. The drama is some of the most forced I&#039;ve seen in my life. The characters are unnatural and borderline retarded for the sake of petty drama.<br />
<br />
The music section of the show is no better.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241676">
        Yuu Haruna Twitter Man plays the D Chord and a C comes out, and that&#039;s all you need to know about it.<br />
<br />
The animation is terrible and lazy, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m opposed to anything with an Ecchi tag, and this anime is the reason why. I bet all the sexually repressed 12-year olds were fucking loving the bathing scenes. Congratulations to them, I hope your hormones were properly activated.<br />
<br />
FUCK Fukka. I&#039;ll probably be unironically writing a fanfiction where Yuu Haruna dies a slow, painful death<br />
<br />
EDIT: After the first 9 episodes, Fuuka stops being a forced, unbearable trainwreck and becomes obnoxiously generic instead. This apparently coincides with the point where they deviated from the source work, which is telling. I&#039;m a sucker for romances and good endings though, so the score goes up to a 2. It&#039;s almost sad, really. It could&#039;ve been the perfect example of a godawful show, but I&#039;m glad they at least tried to make it good in the end.

    There’s a type of show that has been showing up more and more in recent seasons, whether we as critics and reviewers like it or not. These are the shows whose success relies completely on how much the viewer likes a single character, with all of the show’s potential wasted on making this character as interesting and appealing as possible. Unfortunately, the result is, more often than not, a show with a cast of boring cardboard cutouts overshadowed by a single interesting character whose personality is a horrible Frankenstein’s monster of character traits that, despite not meshing, the show’s creators desperately hope will appeal to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239612">
        many fans.<br />
<br />
“Fuuka,” Diomedia’s latest production, is one such show.<br />
<br />
It’s a shame, honestly. Diomedia’s previous work, “Gi(a)rlish Number,” was thoroughly enjoyable due to its wide and well-developed cast of characters. Each character in “Gi(a)rlish Number” exhibited a specific set of character traits that could be identified and explained easily, character traits which managed to bounce off of each other and create legitimately interesting interactions. It came as a surprise, of course, to me when I was told by a friend that “Fuuka” was quite the opposite.<br />
	<br />
	CHARACTERS - 2/10<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve said before, the entire show is carried by a single character - Fuuka Akitsuki. As this is an ecchi romance, what ultimately decides Fuuka&#039;s success as a character is how appealing she is to the viewer. Her character hits on some of the right notes - She&#039;s very cute, for one, and certainly stands out in a crowd, given her pretty design and unique style of dressing. <br />
<br />
However, Fuuka only stands out visually. Personality-wise, it&#039;s very difficult to figure out what kind of person she actually is. One moment she&#039;s acting defensive and violent, and the next she is acting clingy and romantic. Fuuka seemingly has trouble understanding what other characters are thinking, as well. At one point she catches the protagonist with a childhood friend and immediately jumps to the conclusion that this friend is the protagonist&#039;s girlfriend. After she runs away, the protagonist tries to talk to her, but she gives him the silent treatment until eventually punching him and saying &quot;baka&quot; in a very generic tsundere voice. Now, it&#039;s only natural to have mood swings, and, for some characters, mood swings can become a very entertaining plot point. But Fuuka&#039;s mood swings are little more than an annoyance, and are especially jarring due to their stark contrast against the two-dimensionality of the rest of the cast. <br />
<br />
The main character is a run-of-the-mill, obnoxiously dense high-schooler, someone who can&#039;t help but get into perverted situations and then not understand what&#039;s going on. Usually, I can tolerate annoying characters as long as their annoying traits either make sense within the context of the narrative or advance the plot. However, this isn&#039;t true for our protagonist. When faced with a difficult task such as playing the bass for a rock band, he has the typical shounen-protagonist response of telling himself that he&#039;ll &quot;do his best.&quot; I mentioned previously how Fuuka reacts to his being with this childhood friend. Well, he barely attempts to explain to Fuuka what&#039;s actually going on. The two main characters are so infuriatingly unable to understand what&#039;s happening that their misunderstandings drive the entire plot. If there&#039;s a better definition of &quot;contrivance,&quot; I&#039;m not aware that it exists.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters, they&#039;re also pretty cookie-cutter. There&#039;s a gay guy whose entire personality is defined by his homosexuality, a controlling idol who would probably be one of my favorite characters if we actually learned more about her motivation and her reasons for existing other than providing forced tension between Fuuka and our protagonist, and a legion of sisters who always seem to be naked when our protagonist comes home for no purpose other than fanservice. There&#039;s not much else to say here.<br />
<br />
	VISUALS - 7/10<br />
<br />
Diomedia has impressed me pretty consistently with their visual style. The characters are drawn with realistic proportions (with the exception of breasts, but it&#039;s an ecchi show - they&#039;re supposed to be large and attractive) and pretty eyes, and there is solid animation of hair blowing in the wind and of ocean waves crashing. Diomedia&#039;s style is characterized by the fact that the lines bordering objects are not black but are instead darker tones of said object&#039;s color. This gives the art a very vibrant, fun-to-look-at feel. During the opening sequence, the lines are traditional colors, with the shadows darker than usual in a sort of comic-book style. This is also nice, because it not only sets the opening sequence apart from the rest of the anime, but it gives the feeling of an exciting rock concert.<br />
<br />
	SOUND - 7/10<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s a show about music. Of course the music is going to be good. The opening theme is performed well, and the female vocalist is especially talented. It reminds me of the ending theme from &quot;Mob Psycho 100,&quot; which is one of my personal favorites. <br />
<br />
My one complaint is that, although the song is good, we hear it multiple times in every episode. If something is going to be a shows opening, it&#039;s reasonable to assume that we&#039;ll hear it at the start of every episode, at the end of the finale, and perhaps one or two times during exciting scenes near the end of the series. However, whenever the band is playing, they play the OP. Once again, the song is good, but it gets old very quickly when you hear it as often as you do. <br />
<br />
	STORY - 3/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mean to sound crude, but the story feels like an eighth-grader&#039;s goofy sexual fantasy. The contrivances in the plot are absolutely hilarious, creating a perfect storyline for the protagonist that not only gets him into multiple perverted situations with Fuuka but that gets him making out with her not long after they&#039;ve met. It&#039;s completely and totally unrealistic to think that the girl who accuses you of taking photos of her panties would ask you out within the day. It&#039;s equally unrealistic to think that she&#039;d let you stare at her ass without noticing what was going on only a few short days later. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a subplot about a rock band which is, unfortunately, thoroughly unoriginal. It feels as though the band was simply thrown in for the sake of giving the story more substance, but the idea of joining a high-school band has been done many times, to a much better effect (May I suggest &quot;K-On!&quot;?). More coincidences are left for the viewer to simply accept - The band is missing a bassist and a vocalist, and it just HAPPENS to be Fuuka and the protagonist&#039;s favorite band, and these two just HAPPEN to be capable of playing the missing instrument and singing (Speaking of singing, the way that they establish Fuuka&#039;s talent is also painfully silly - She and the protagonist are walking home and she suddenly opens her mouth and belts out a really loud, really low song that most likely wakes up half of the people in town who are trying to sleep).<br />
<br />
I have a small amount of knowledge of the manga, so I know where the story is going. Without spoiling anything, I must say that the impending plot twist will certainly distinguish Fuuka from other ecchi romance shows. However, the effectiveness of the plot twist will, of course, depend on how much the viewer likes Fuuka herself. If the viewer doesn&#039;t feel any emotional attachment to her, the plot twist will likely feel like another contrivance, and will be another unintentionally funny moment. My friend who dropped this show burst out laughing and vowed to watch the rest when I alerted him to this twist.<br />
<br />
	ENJOYMENT - 4/10<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m not too impressed by the show. Having not read the manga, I don&#039;t know what direction the series will take after this nebulous plot twist hits, but I doubt that it will totally save the show. As of right now, I don&#039;t like Fuuka&#039;s character, and I can&#039;t see that changing before the end of the series. Of course, the art is still great and the music is enjoyable. I&#039;ve always liked to see shows about bands and musicians. And I won&#039;t lie - I do enjoy the fanservice. <br />
<br />
However, for a show that I started watching on a whim because a friend said it was &quot;aggressively average,&quot; I do think I&#039;ll keep watching because I&#039;m interested in what direction it might take in the future. If nothing else, it will provide me with a good laugh.<br />
<br />
I hope you found this review helpful.<br />

    Anime original adaptations have always been a heavily debated subject within the anime community.<br />
In some cases it has resulted in a far superior product than its source material, like with Usagi Drop.<br />
In other cases it has downright split the franchise&#039;s fan base in half, like with Fullmetal Alchemist 2003.<br />
And yet in other cases still it has been widely considered to have been a simply terrible decision, like with Akame ga Kill.<br />
Whatever your stance on those particular series may be, I think most of us can at least agree on the fact that going heavily anime original instead of faithfully following the source material is very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243368">
        hit-or-miss. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not. And in Fuuka&#039;s case, I am honestly not sure what to think of it, because its original elements ended up turning an already mediocre manga into an equally mediocre anime... but for totally different reasons.<br />
<br />
Before I get into this though, I would just like to mention that Fuuka is actually a next generation sequel to an older series called Suzuka. To get straight to the point, no you do *not* need to watch/read it before watching this anime as they are wholly separate stories. All you really need to know is that the protagonist and main heroine of Suzuka are Fuuka&#039;s parents, and that they are both national level athletes. That aside Suzuka is a ten times better romance manga than Fuuka has ever been so I would still definitely recommend it if you have the time (never watched its anime though but as far as I know it was a very incomplete adaptation so you are probably better off with the manga).<br />
<br />
In any case, Fuuka is to a large extent a rather old school and cliché romance drama. We begin with the fairly reserved and introverted protagonist Haruna Yuu who prefers to spend his spare time on Twitter over hanging out with friends, who one day moves to a new town. There he runs into a strange yet energetic girl with blue hair called Akatsuki Fuuka; a girl running around wearing a pair of headphones and listening to an old CD-player instead of using a phone. Some misunderstandings ensue, but the two of them eventually sort things out, and in the process end up befriending each other. And so begins the spark of a potential romance in the making. Fuuka is someone living with an uncertain future. Because of her parents she is largely expected to become a professional athlete as well, but that is not something she wants to become. Instead, she spends a lot of time outside hanging out with Yuu in order to try to find what she really wants to do in life. And eventually, the answer she arrives at with Yuu&#039;s help, is music, which alongside romance is the central theme of the story as the two of them set out to start a band together with their friends from school.<br />
<br />
It all sounds simple enough, but unfortunately, there are some serious problems with Fuuka as an anime. First and foremost, the drama is incredibly forced and unnatural more often than not. Numerous times we have girls just so happening to show up at *just* the right/wrong moment in order to catch Yuu in some interaction with another girl, leading to misunderstanding upon misunderstanding which the story then has to go about an episode or two sorting out only to return to the status quo again. There is even a scene in the first episode where Yuu and Fuuka are supposed to meet up in town and end up missing each other for a ridiculously long time just because they were standing on opposite sides of a statue at their decided meeting location. I mean seriously? Just how stupid is that? Or how about how she just casually breaks his phone in the opening scene of the show just because he (completely unintentionally) caught a glimpse of her panties? I mean people... would not normally do that, not to mention how Yuu actually reacts to the situation as if it somehow *is* normal. The story has a tendency of generating its continuity through quite simply retarded character behavior which in turn results in drama.<br />
<br />
The second problem is the characters themselves. While Fuuka is an all-round likable girl with her cheerful and constantly energetic personality, she, just like everyone else in the show, has a tendency to sometimes act incredibly abnormal just for sake of drama as mentioned previously. But you also have to ask just why she would fall in love with Yuu to begin with? Sure, he helped her find a new passion in music by starting a band together, but beyond that Yuu is kind of a doormat. He is cautious and anti-social in nature and generally just follows along wherever Fuuka drags him along, and just feels incredibly bland and uninteresting in general. And do not even get me started on the other band members, they are so forgettable and have so little character development that their sole purpose in the show is effectively to be Yuu&#039;s and Fuuka&#039;s sidekicks by providing instrumental support. The final character of note is Hinashi Koyuki: an old childhood friend of Yuu who has now become a popular idol. She creates what is a rather unnecessary love triangle by frequently trying to get in-between Fuuka and Yuu, which not only causes drama in-between them but also on a larger scale when her idol otaku fans find out about her feelings after some pictures end up being leaked on the internet. And now we are really getting into the epitome of ridiculous character behavior by seeing how aggressively and violently some of her fans react to the news. Granted I am well aware that there are in fact some really crazy idol fans out there in the real world too, but still come on.<br />
<br />
The third and final major issue with Fuuka is the anime original content. This is fairly difficult to talk about without spoiling anything, but basically everything from the middle of episode eight and onwards is all anime original. Now, the manga is quite infamous for having one of the most wtf plot twists ever a couple of volumes in which completely alters the story for all future, and not in a good way. This also happens to be one of the worst kept secrets in the anime community though so if you have somehow avoided being spoiled on this then... congratulations. As stupid as this development was though, it was at least quite unique, and really it is without a doubt the most memorable part of the entire manga. So when the anime then decided to not even adapt this at all and instead to go off do something different altogether, I was left with some rather mixed feelings. Sure, if the original version is bad to begin with then doing something else in the anime is not a bad idea on paper, but replacing it with something equally mediocre is not really an improvement. The manga&#039;s version was at least unorthodox and unexpected even if it was dumb, but the anime&#039;s version is bad *and* generic on top of it. I do not know about you, but personally I would rather take the former. Furthermore, the reason the manga&#039;s development is bad is not because of the twist itself (that was actually kind of cool I thought), but rather that the author seemingly ran out of steam completely because ever since it happened, there has been absolutely nothing good happening in it, and that is now over 100 chapters ago... which is kind of inexcusable. However, since the anime would not have covered very far beyond the twist with merely 12 episodes anyway, that would not really have been a problem so why not just adapt it faithfully for as long as the timespan allows and then stop? That would have made sense to me. At the very least it should have been better than the manga if so, but now... I am not so sure. Because instead, we are left with a bunch of additional forced drama between Yuu, Fuuka and Koyuki for our anime original ending, with a heavily increased emphasis on the latter compared to the manga. And while I guess we at least got a sort of conclusive ending for anime-only viewers this way, it still felt very underwhelming in the end.<br />
<br />
According to an interview with the anime staff and the original mangaka uploaded to Animenewsnetwork on March 17th, Seo Kouji said that while he had never regretted taking the manga in the peculiar direction he did, he had always been thinking about the what-if scenario where had decided not to, and thus said that if Fuuka was finally getting an anime adaptation he would like to take the chance to showcase this what-if scenario in the anime instead, and apparently the anime&#039;s producer thought the same. I guess that is a simple and understandable reason, but it also feels more like self-satisfaction than trying to come up with the best final product anime-wise to me. Also, if he really felt that way, was there any reason to throw in all these subtle teasers about the twist throughout the anime only to then never adapt it anyway? It literally feels like nothing but an attempt at trolling and baiting those anime viewers who had already read the manga, which would be rather unprofessional if so.<br />
<br />
If there is anything positive to mention about this anime though, it would definitely be the music. Of course this might be expected to go hand-in-hand with being an actual music anime, but either way the live performances in Fuuka are actually pretty awesome. Especially the first half of episode eight (right before the original content starts) was really enjoyable to listen to, and by far the best scene of the anime. Granted, this naturally depends on your taste in music as well, but at the very least I think the band performances were really well-made when they actually gave it their all (though it would have been nice if there was a greater song repertoire used throughout the anime). And that is one thing which was most certainly a hell of a lot better than in the manga; there are few things more awkward than reading about a supposedly awesome concert when all you are hearing is the deafening sound of complete and utter silence set to still imagery.<br />
<br />
Overall though, the main problems with Fuuka stem from the manga being mediocre to begin with rather than it being anyone at Diomedea&#039;s fault, and while the decision to go anime original is questionable and in my mind probably wrong, I can still somewhat understand it, and relatively speaking it still resulted in a final product which is not necessarily too much worse than its source material (which admittedly does not say very much). The music elements of the show also come across a lot better in anime format due to actual presence of audio this time, so overall I would still say this was an okay-ish adaptation relative to the manga all things considered. Unfortunately, that still does not make it a very good anime in this case.

    Intro <br />
Fuuka based off the manga of the same name is a drama/music anime. Usually music animes aren’t really a genre that I consider that often however from reading the synopsis of the plot and seeing what it was like it piqued my interest. Although I haven’t read the source material yet after this drama I’ll be interested to see it. <br />
<br />
Story and setting <br />
The story for Fuuka largely follows the character of Yuu Haruna a teenager that moved to a nearby town to live with is sisters after his father was moved overseas for work. In the town Yuu encounters several interesting people but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243946">
        the one that stands out is Fuuka who he meets in the worst way possible. After clearing up any misunderstandings that they had Fuuka and Yuu become fast friends and after some rather sudden inspiration decided to form a band consisting of five people that are from the same school though not known to each other. The story alternates between the performances and the struggles of the band and the interpersonal relationships of Yuu, Fuuka and several main and support characters like Koyuki. The anime is largely set in Tokyo although it moves to other places when needed. <br />
Like most anime Fuuka’s story consists of a main plot line that is interspersed with several subplot lines that provide greater insight into some characters. Although I haven’t read the manga some of my friends do and I know that some parts of the anime were changed better accommodate characters that didn’t have as much parts in the manga and give them more of a chance. While I did appreciate the fact that the writers gave the character Koyuki who is my favourite female character on here more screen time I feel that if Fuuka had her original fate things maybe would have been better. <br />
<br />
Overall I quite liked the story as it not only gave the chance for Yuu and Fuuka to create a band and have fun with something that they both enjoy but also meet others that have the same passion. As a music anime, the key thing is not only do they need to have a strong vocalist but they also need to have a great band backing them up. In this it was nice to see each of the members who originally did not gel to eventually discover that they liked it and get serious and practice. Watching it all come together in one of their performances was impressive. The other part of the main plot is the interpersonal relationships which for the most part are focused on Yuu and the girls Fuuka and Koyuki. I felt that the romance part of the show was well done with both girls being pretty strong characters that have great personalities. In the end, I felt that the romance plot line was handled well enough though I feel that Koyuki was the better girl. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fuuka <br />
<br />
Fuuka voiced by veteran seiyuu Lynn of High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and the character that the anime/manga is named after. She serves as the main heroine for the story. A positive, upbeat and cheerful girl that’s also rather hyperactive Fuuka acts as the heart of not just the story but also the band. Fuuka is an energetic girl who despite being quick to get angry generally will be the one that says sorry first and is quite friendly. Despite looking like she’s enjoying her high school life Fuuka has feels that she has a hole in her life that makes her life seem empty. This and her love with music was what ultimately caused her to form her own band. The most notable trait of Fuuka is arguably her positive and cheerful nature in that she can stay positive in just about any situation. The frustration that Fuuka feels as part of the emptiness in her life is one of the core reasons for forming the series titular band Fallen moon both to satisfy he love for music both in performing and creating and to enjoy her high school life properly. Fuuka’s personality changes very little over the series but meeting Yuu does alter some of her outlooks in life. Fuuka’s interactions with Yuu is actually quite funny especially when they are still unsure about the feelings that they have for each other. I feel that Fuuka’s seiyuu Lynn actually did a pretty good job voicing her. <br />
<br />
Yu<br />
<br />
Yu Haruna voiced by veteran voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the anime.  A Decent, quiet and good natured teenager that moves to Tokyo to live with his sisters after his parents were moved to other country for work Fuuka acts as the conscience and the glue of the band. A good-natured teenager that seems to have an unusual obsession with Twitter Yu can be best described as a rather normal looking teenager that doesn’t actually stand out that much. This isn’t helped by the fact that Yu is actually pretty quiet by nature which reinforces people’s views. Unlike Fuuka who loves music Yu’s love for it did not materialize until the band was formed. Even then his perception towards music which actually forms a part of the main plot didn’t start to change until much later. However, as Yuu continued to practice and perform with the band Yu grew to both appreciate not just the making of music but also of the fun that you get from playing instruments with others that share your passions. This caused his normal quiet and reserved personality to change and Yu become more positive and happy and allowed him to see that there is more to life than twitter. The gradual change in Yu’s personality I felt was well done and I feel that this change was quite natural as well. I feel that Yu’s voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi did a great job voicing Yu. <br />
<br />
Koyuki <br />
<br />
Koyuki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of the irregular at magic high school and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the second main female lead. Kind, caring and understanding Koyuki is a teenager and a popular pop singer that is quite popular in Japan. A childhood friend of Yu’s Koyuki and Yu used to hang out pretty much every day when they were little and Yu’s nickname for her actually comes from when he saw her sing a song and heard how nice her voice was. In the anime, Yu and Koyuki only met again recently as they were separated when they were little due to family circumstances. Being a childhood friend Koyuki actually is the one that understands Yuu the most and she tries to help Yu when needed. Koyuki also has feelings for Yu that slowly become apparent as the series goes on. Though im not sure how Koyuki’s act was handled in the manga I actually liked the romance between Yu and Koyuki as it felt natural and that both had feelings for each other both then and now. As a pop singer that’s also voiced by a veteran seiyuu singer the character Koyuki within the story was given several songs that she sung with my favourite actually being the duet between her and Fuuka. I felt that each of these performances was pretty strong. I also felt that the balance between a pop idols career and her personal life while certainly not as true as it shows was pretty well done. Overall I felt that Saori Hayami did a excellent job portraying Koyuki as a sweet and endearing childhood friend that still loves the main character after all this time.  <br />
<br />
Sara <br />
Sara voiced by veteran seiyuu Mikako Komatsu of Tales of Zestiria and Hai to gensou no grimgar fame is one of the main characters of the show and is one of the members of Fuuka’s band. Sara is one of the members of the band and one of Fuuka and Yu’s friends. A second-year student that attends the same high school as Yu and the rest of the band Sara can be described as quiet, reserved and shy and not good around people. In this she is pretty similar to Yu right down to the fact that both are twitter users. In the anime, Sara and Yu unknowingly know each other which when realized created a rather funny conversation in which Sara’s personality changed completely. In the beginning, Sara’s personality created a number of problems due to the fact that she preferred to do things her way while her quiet nature made it difficult for others to talk to her. Apart from her brother Sara’s closest relationship is arguably with Yu as to Sara he is the only person that she knows both online and offline and as such is one of the few that she feels comfortable to be around with. I feel that the change in Sara’s personality was quite natural and seeing her lose composure over Yu is pretty funny. I feel that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu did a pretty good job here. <br />
<br />
Makoto <br />
<br />
Makoto voiced by veteran voice actor Soma Saito of Divine gate and Rokka no yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of Fuuka’s band. Makoto is first year student like Yuu and Fuuka and is actually one of Fuuka’s old friends. A calm, friendly and good natured person Makoto usually serves as the voice of reason within the band. Makoto shares a passion for music like Fuuka and actually is an accomplished piano player having won many competitions. In the band, he serves as the keyboardist. Makoto is the only character in the series that seems to have a problem that’s causing him to worry that wasn’t sorted out in this series. In this case, it’s his relationship with his family. Despite this Makoto is well liked by many people due to his easy-going nature and he’s always the one that breaks up tense situations. I feel that his voice actor Soma Saito did a good job portraying him. <br />
<br />
Nachi <br />
Nachi voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuyuki Okitsu of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio and Orange fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of Fuuka’s band. A high school student and a former member of the school’s track team Nachi can be best described as a friendly, serious and solid person that is also passionate about things that he does. Originally Nachi was part of the school’s track team that was trying hard to recruit Fuuka having seen her run times but this passion of his soon changed to music after realizing how fun it could be. Nachi is perhaps the one character that took the longest to actually get into the band but later become a pretty good drummer and grew to like being in the band. Though Nachi did not want to do music at first and did not have high hopes about being good at it Nachi proved to be a capable drummer for the band having actually owned a drum set for some time. Though unwilling at first Nachi like everyone else in the band grew to love performing and having fun with friends. <br />
<br />
Hedgehog band members <br />
Hedgehog’s is a band that existed prior to Fuuka’s forming of her own and is one of the main casts favourite bands.  Formed of five members like most bands they went in hiatus before the events of the story but served as inspiration for Fuuka enough in that she formed her own band.  Over the series, the cast comes into contact with the former members that advice and assist them in their endeavors. The five are voiced by veteran seiyuu’s Yoko Hikasa of the Devil is a part timer fame, Manami Numakura of unlimited Fafnir fame and veteran voice actors Daisuke Hirakawa and Daisuke Ono and Yuichi Nakamura of Denpa Kyoushi and Fairy tail fame. <br />
<br />
Arts and animation<br />
<br />
The arts and animation of the series I felt was pretty good. Character designs I felt were reasonably good as was the animation that was used. <br />
<br />
Music <br />
As a music anime, the music of course is an important part of the anime’s charm and story. In terms of music I liked both the opening song climber’s high which was sung by the hedgehog through the lead singers seiyuu and the second opening theme Yukihanabi that was sung by Koyuki’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami. The cover songs that were sung by Fuuka’s band as well as Fuuka’s original song I felt was also well done. <br />
<br />
Voice acting <br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting I felt that Fuuka’s and Koyuki’s seiyuu’s Lynn and Saori Hayami both did a great job portraying their characters in the series. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
For a music/drama anime to be successful it needs to have both a strong music element that is able to dazzle the audience with strong songs and music and a good drama story to link the personal relationships of the series characters together in an interesting way. This balance of themes I felt was done reasonably well in this anime as firstly the music element was actually pretty good. This was helped greatly by the amazing singing ability of Fuuka’s seiyuu Lynn which combined with the music by the band members really made their performances a sight to see. The drama element though well designed and executed was not as good. While I did like the fact that the character of Koyuki who actually is my favourite female character on here was given more of a larger role I felt that the romance between Yu and Fuuka felt a bit dragged out. I would have been happy if the anime had followed the manga and let her have the same fate as she did in the manga instead. But in truth that part of the romance felt unnecessarily dragged out. Apart from that the music which was actually quite strong here with regards to both the cover songs and the original songs and the animation were relatively good. Voice acting as noted was also pretty good with Saori Hayami and Lynn doing a fantastic job here as always. <br />

    Fuuka&#039;s main character is the epitome of patience, forgiveness, and all around charity. We can observe some of this overflowing generosity in even the very first episode. Now our main protagonist here is a shining example of peace, perhaps comparable to Martin Luther King Junior or Ghandi, but that wouldn&#039;t be very humble or modest, now would it? See, I myself am not a very patient or forgiving person, I&#039;ll admit. I&#039;ll sometimes be hateful and rude to other who may not deserve that hate. After watching Fuuka, I&#039;ve realized the error of my ways and now strive to become just like the main character.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238998">
        Well what makes this main character so great, you ask? <br />
<br />
Listen carefully now. In the very first episode we can begin to see the shining purity of the main character. Within just two days, he gets his all important phone broken twice by the same woman. Normally, I would have been infuriated by this woman&#039;s actions, bubbling with rage. But does out protagonist falter? No, he calmly just pays up several hundred dollars without protest. But the story of our protagonist&#039;s charity does not end here, no no. See, the woman who broke his phone both times did not ever compensate or apologize in the slightest for her actions, but luckily for her, our shining hero is a kind and patient man. Because he was such a gentleman, he took the lady out on a date to her favorite movie! How wonderful and kind!<br />
<br />
See, we could all learn from this man&#039;s example- all of us; no matter who you are, whether it be the president of the United States or a young businessman. If your house has been robbed of tens of thousands of dollars worth of cash and property, don&#039;t take the hasty action of calling the police; instead, track down the thief yourself, apologize for not having more valuable items for him/her to take, and calmly offer to instead give your house to him/her as compensation.

    I guess Fuuka is another anime that has a decent rating, but mainly has reviews bashing it.  Luckily, I didn&#039;t watch it all and end up hating it so I&#039;ll be one of the few so far to give it a higher score.<br />
<br />
The story follows Fuuka and how she came to meet Yuu Haruna.  They end gathering a few other students and they form a band together.  There&#039;s romantic stuff thrown into the mix and it ends up just being an enjoyable show as you watch the characters get more attached to each other. <br />
<br />
The art is vibrant and colorful like it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243393">
        should be for a show based around music.  I really like the character designs and outfits too.  The outfits actually kind of help you tell what the characters main type of role is in the show.<br />
<br />
The sound was really good.  The slower music scores worked well for the romantic scenes and drama scenes, while the more upbeat lyrics worked well for their concerts/performances, and happy moments.  Both types of sound tied very nicely together.<br />
<br />
The characters are kind of lacking though.  I don&#039;t hate any of them, but not all of them are memorable.  At least, the main characters get development.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching this each week.  It is something different and all the elements came to together to make it a really enjoyable experience.

    Some of y&#039;all writing reviews really need to get a grip. If you really think this show is one of the worst animes ever then you need to watch more anime. Like y&#039;all hating so much for what? grow up before you write a review. Just because the anime has a different ending than the manga doesn&#039;t make it bad, I thought it worked well. The music was awesome and the characters were really enjoyable. So what if you think its predictable, shouldn&#039;t all that matter is if you enjoyed it or not? I was never bored once while watching and thoroughly enjoyed the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378178">
        as a whole. I cant even think of any super huge flaws about it, everything was wrapped up nicely. I would only say not to watch it if you aren&#039;t into music anime but other than that its a great one time watch. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re thinking about watching, give it a shot. Don&#039;t let others influence you giving it a chance because its nothing like what these people are making it out to be. I actually want a continuation to the story but because of all the negative feedback i&#039;m seeing sadly I don&#039;t think i&#039;ll get anything. Anyways give it a watch especially if you&#039;re into music anime, its definitely a fun watch. (Watched in sub)

    I believe that anime like Fuuka are a breed apart from the usual slice of life anime that we&#039;ve been struck with as of late. <br />
<br />
You guys all know what I&#039;m talking about; those anime that show great promise initially but then taper off into bitter disappointment or worse boredom. <br />
<br />
Fuuka manages to break the barrier set by these mediocre anime in several regards. <br />
<br />
I will be the first to admit that its story is nothing original but neither is it terrible and that&#039;s exactly what you want in a slice of life. The art style is great to look at and the soundboard of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239575">
        the series is better than many others I have heard (although I have found slice of lifers to have generally fantastic music). <br />
<br />
Where this series shines though is in its characters and its progression of the story. Rare is the anime these days where you feel that there is actual progression of the story with each episode. While the main character is nothing too special the heroine possesses a kind of bubbly charm unique to her character which really stands out, particularly as this is a romance anime. <br />
<br />
What I like the most is that there is a clear progression of the relationship between the two leads and it is neither at a snails pace nor breakneck quick in its development. <br />
<br />
5 episodes in and I am decently confident that in this anime we might actually be left off with a confirmed relationship rather than the &quot;friends but not friends&quot; endings we get with most &quot;romance&quot; anime.

    What makes a good character? In my opinion, the most essential thing of all is a relatable personality. Otherwise, the audience won’t be able to sympathise with the character at all. This is why people are criticising Kirito from Sword Art Online for being too overpowered; while at the same time praising Saitama from One Punch Man even though he’s litteraly one of the most overpowered characters in all of fiction including the bible. What makes us care about him is his altruism and normal life style. He’s depicted as a normal dude who just happens to be a godlike figure, whereas Kirito is depicted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243910">
        as a godlike figure who just happens to be a normal dude.<br />
<br />
This is also why the characters in Fuuka never succeeds in making me give two shits about them. From the get go we are presented with a main character whose actions are as logical as a flat Earth painted by Dali. Not only does he decide to hang out with the psycho who just smashed his phone into a million pieces, but he also decides not to mention the fact that the very famous singer said psycho loves is an old childhood friend of his; something he doesn’t tell her until episode four, after they’ve gone to her concert together. <br />
<br />
This is where we as an audience gets pulled out of the immersion of the show. Because just like a magic trick isn’t as effective if we’re able to see the card hidden in the sleeve, a show loses its credibility if the audience are able to see the hand of the director. In this case it’s painfully obvious that the only reason why the main character acts as he does, is to create drama later on. In other words, the show sacrifices its inner logic in favor of a spicy story.<br />
<br />
In fact, the whole show is a little bit too convenient. The main character just happens to be a childhood friend of Fuuka’s favorite singer. Their teacher just happens to be a member of Fuuka’s favorite band. The person Yuu tweets with just happens to be sitting in front of him. The list goes on. And when you have so many examples of coincidences stacked on top of each other, it becomes impossible to relate to anything that happens just because it’s so unbelievable.<br />
<br />
The shallow characters combined with the bad story structure results in a big ol’ mess. The show never seems to figure out what it wants to be, and by the time you reach the end you get a feeling of what was the point? The only real charachter development in the whole show is that Yuu learns how to play the bass on a professional level in the span of what feels like a few weeks, that’s it. In the end, Fuuka expects you to relate to unrelatable characters and believe an unbelievable story. And not to mention, it’s pretty &amp;#@% boring.<br />

    What makes a great anime is the story of the original author!A little detour is fine but stay on the time line!Like how Akame ga kill ended. It aint that far from reality. <br />
But  the screen writer of this anime just ruin Kouji Seo&#039;s master piece! Starting from episode 8 they alter the entire story just to give way to their goddess tama-chan! They could have hired a neutral screen writer than a worshiper. The drama is so obviously forced!<br />
I bet this anime will end up not getting any season extension. Good job screen writer! You delayed the anime release for a week just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242293">
        to ruin everything! Im begging the anime studio not to let that screen writer never to meddle with your future anime&#039;s again!

    Fuuka is one of the worst anime i&#039;ve seen this season. After sitting through the panty shots and bad charecter devolopment, I can&#039;t seem to find interest in the story. All the perfect moments were ruined by boobs or ass (The end of ep 4 mostly) and they didn&#039;t even try to be clever! I couldn&#039;t even get through ep. 4 without even rolling my eyes! It&#039;s fine if an anime has a bit of ecchi in it, but please, please make it bearable to watch. <br />
  Another thing that completley ruined this anime was the childhood friend. You knew she&#039;d never win the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238879">
        love triangle based on the main charecter&#039;s stupidity! He can&#039;t even realise when a girl is in love with him! Plus, who would fall for a bland, dull guy like that? It&#039;s just not realistic!<br />
  Fuuka is not even a good charecter. We don&#039;t seen enough backstory to this charecter to even like her  or not. She&#039;s just a big blob of drama in this anime and honestly, if they actually replaced her with a better, mofd realistic version of this charecter, I wouldn&#039;t complain.
