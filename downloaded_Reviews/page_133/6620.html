    Tokyo Ghoul except everything that was good is bad.<br />
<br />
As a fan of the first two seasons I can&#039;t see this season as anything other than a massive failure and disappointment.<br />
<br />
Story-5<br />
Very tiny spoiler: Haise is Kaneki. Wow this show is boring. I&#039;m not sure that a single interesting thing has happened in 12 episodes. Basically it&#039;s just 12 episodes of Haise and his new buddies fighting ghouls. Not a single fight is cool, interesting, or well animated, and not a single character is as good as a character from season one. <br />
<br />
One thing I found so great about the original is that the man-eating ghouls who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281565">
        couldn&#039;t possibly seen as good people were constantly and effectively humanized through the folks at Anteiku.  It presented an incredibly difficult and interesting conflict where ghouls and humans desperately want peace but simply cannot coexist. Kaneki and friends constantly tried to balance peace and protecting their friends and that&#039;s part of what made the show great. <br />
Well no more Anteiku. No more of Kaneki&#039;s old friends. And no more ghouls that are worth caring about. They&#039;re all gone and replaced with Haise&#039;s boring crew of half ghoul investigators and a bunch of ghouls who&#039;s most interesting and human trait is that they don&#039;t want to die.<br />
<br />
Art-6<br />
Significantly uglier than the original. The drop in animation quality is actually both astounding and depressing. A show that could be praised for it&#039;s stellar animation and dark edgy art has fallen so so low. It&#039;s production budget is likely close to half of the original and it shows. Not one fight sequence is cool or impressive and the art can also be incredibly inconsistent at times.<br />
<br />
Sound-6<br />
Also a big step down. The opening is good but not nearly as good as the original. The ending is also fine but kind of weird and not worth adding to any kind of playlist. All the background music is mediocre and totally forgettable. The sound does almost nothing to improve this adaptation.<br />
<br />
Character-4<br />
This is actually the worst part of the show. Haise has to be the most boring main character I&#039;ve seen all season, maybe all year. His only character trait is that he cares about his friends and his current lifestyle. It&#039;s essentially impossible to get anything more than that out of his character. Every time he speaks it&#039;s something about how much he loves his life or how he doesn&#039;t want to be Kaneki again because he loves his life so much right now. I was constantly wanting him to return to being Kaneki against his will because I was so damn tired of Haise&#039;s babbling.<br />
<br />
No side character is worth me mentioning with the exception of Urie (half ghoul investigator who works under Haise) who has untapped potential as of now. All the new ghouls are boring. All of Haise&#039;s new friends are a bore. They add nothing to the show whatsoever. The biggest internal conflict seen in a side character is &quot;Damn killing ghouls is kind of sad.&quot; Really groundbreaking stuff. Massive failure in character writing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-5<br />
Obviously I did not enjoy this show and my expectations were shattered. This show has almost no redeeming qualities, and I never once looked forward to the next episode. <br />
<br />
Overall-5<br />
I don&#039;t understand how anyone can watch the all three seasons of Tokyo Ghoul and say that this one stands up to the first two. It&#039;s clearly a massively overambitious failure of a project. <br />
I haven&#039;t read the manga and I don&#039;t plan to. This is a review of the anime only.

    Tokyo Kushu Re is bad excuse for a sequel. The story starts off as a complete mess, directly jumping into action without any build-up and focusing around characters that have not even been introduced. Somehow the series assumes that it doens&#039;t have to put any efford into explaining any of these new things because it&#039;s part of already existing franchise.This makes it very hard to actually care about anything that is happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soon after, it becomes clear that our main character has gone thru some trauma and now suffers from amnesia. Great, isn&#039;t this just perfectly cliche writing and also a way to turn all the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278868">
        character development seen in season 1 and 2 back to zero. I am not exactly sure what type of author hates their characters so much to go and do something like this. I disliked Kaneki Ken in the beginning of S01, but still came to like him because of his character development. And now I am supposed to see the same shite again? How about no. Alternative version in the same universe would have been a much better idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
I admit, I was never a big fan of Tokyo Kushu. I did see S01 twice, S02 once and read the manga once, but still this 3rd season is inferior in every way. All the good things were removed, the director was changed and now the OST - which made the first seasons seem better than they actually were, is now garbage, too. Thus far, there has only been one good scene in the whole show in episode 2 and even that was lend from S02. It&#039;s very hard to recommend this to anyone. Especially those who liked the original series for its characters should stay far away.

    !!POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start off by saying that Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul :Re are two of my favourite manga that I&#039;ve read and they both hold a significant place in my life. The anime adaptions before :Re had been iffy to say the best, Season 1 of TG whilst not terrible left out a lot of content due to how few episodes they had and Root A was flat out awful.<br />
<br />
So moving onto the anime adaption of :Re I was very apprehensive about how it was going to play out. Would they try and mish mash anime original and manga canon material

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281562">
        again like they did with Root A or would they ignore Root A and stick to the manga? At the time of these thoughts it wasn&#039;t clear on the direction the show would take, thankfully they decided to forget Root A completely and pushed forward with adapting the :Re manga.<br />
<br />
The fact that the :Re anime ignores the Root A anime is going to leave a lot of anime only people confused, my advice along with the advice of the creator of TG, go read the original manga chapter 1-143 and then you can watch :Re but perhaps you should read it instead. <br />
<br />
How well have they done? The short answer is not great, worse than season 1 better than Root A. <br />
<br />
The long answer, well buckle in. :Re&#039;s biggest problem is its budget. The animation and general art in the show are poor, it is clear that this is the work of people who aren&#039;t the best in the business and that are working under time constraints. There is very much a real lack of soul in this anime and I think a lot of that is due to the budget.<br />
<br />
The next major problem for the :Re anime is the pacing. Just like season 1 they&#039;ve got very few episodes / minutes to tell the story of the first 57 or so chapters of the :Re manga and as manga readers will know :Re starts slow and has a lot of content in those first 50+ chapters. Several episodes adapted 5-6 chapters worth of content the rest around 3-4 chapters per episode. Due to the budget and pacing, a lot of details were left out most notable Haise touching his chin and Fluffy hair Touka. These small details are what made the manga so good. <br />
<br />
Now :Re&#039;s anime didn&#039;t do everything wrong, once again the score has been generally A+ The opening Asphyxia is almost as good as Unravel and the closing isn&#039;t too shabby either. As well as the opening / closing tracks there are several other songs the names of which I do not know that are really quite good, especially the song when Haise and Touka meet. <br />
<br />
Another 1+ for the anime is in regards to the VA, there are 1 or 2 that sound odd (Suzuya and Kanae both sound pretty bad imo.) However, the rest of the cast put in a very strong performance and I was very pleased to see some familiar names return to voice characters that had previously voiced in past seasons. <br />
<br />
Ultimately the anime falls short it was handed a fantastic story on a silver plate and they did it a disservice with how cheaply they made this show. A lot of the focus was put on the fighting which is just a small part of what the manga is and when the animation is as bad as it is in :Re there is nothing to be but to be disappointed. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the Manga my advice is watch it if you&#039;ve really got nothing better to do, if you&#039;re an anime only well I&#039;m sure you&#039;re pretty confused in general about :Re and it&#039;s probably best you go and read TG and then  TG:Re if you really want to experience the story as it was intended. <br />
<br />

    This show is a hot mess. It is confusing due to its poor execution of plot; the animation becomes lazy and sloppy after episode 3; the soundtrack was disappointing and did not live up to the high expectations set up by the priors series and what was well developed characters were turned into archetypal and flat characters. After watching this train wreck I didn&#039;t even feel anger, as if at that point I was numb to the disappointment. All I could say was &quot;Well that sucked&quot;. A few day later I have decide to write a review, because I&#039;m just so bitter.<br />

        Y 3/10<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:Re&#039;s plot is carefully constructed, into a smart and clever story, leaving you desperately anxious and on the end of your seat as you watch the characters tragic tales overlap...- if only I could say the same for the anime. I was talking about the manga UwU The anime takes all these amazing things aND THROWS THEM OUT THE BLOODY WINDOW. It rushes important events and sometimes even pretends they dont happen. When these important events are ignored future events don&#039;t make sense, because they are meant to be a consequence of that past important event????? that you just cut out for no reason???? Also, since this show hadn&#039;t adapted the end of the first series, Tokyo ghoul, the whole plot makes no sense, because that is what triggered Tokyo Ghoul:Re to occur in the first place. <br />
<br />
A R T 3/10<br />
This really upsets me to give it such a low score, this is because at the start of the series the animation was pretty solid and nice to look at. However after episode 3 its just crashes right down into the mud. The animation looks lazy, boring, ugly, flat, silly and downright offensive. While most people for some reason praised the art style I thought it was generic and looked like any average low-budget anime. <br />
<br />
S O U N D 4/10<br />
The Tokyo Ghoul anime adaptations are famous for having its surprisingly good soundtracks that truly manipulate the viewer emotions, such as &quot;Licht Und Schatten&quot; plus &quot;Unravel&quot; from Tokyo Ghoul and &quot;Glassy Sky&quot; also with &quot;On my own&quot; from Tokyo Ghoul Root A. With the standard set so high you&#039;d naturally expect :Re to be the same. Well... ehhhhh. I Mean, its not bad, its far from bad... but nothing was good. There was no song that made you go like &quot;Holy crap that is amazing&quot;, it was all forgettable and just meh but with the bar set so high for the music in the TG franchise, &quot;meh&quot; isnt good enough. Thus it having a low score of 4, even if it would be forgivable with any other show.<br />
<br />
C H A R A C T E R S 2/10<br />
The characters were bland and left a nasty aftertase. In the Tokyo Ghoul:Re manga, at first these characters still do look bland and generic, but what saves them from staying this way is the amazing and well thought out backstorys and future character development. Annoyingly, the anime fails again to make a solid stride and doesn&#039;t give any of these characters the proper stoplight they deserve. Apart from Haise and Urie all of the developments and backstories are rushed. Instead of them spending a good episode length on the development (like I think they should be) some of them are mushed into a dreadful 5 minutes. I think that Urie&#039;s execution and portrayal of his personality traits, inner monologue and backstory were wonderfully done; so was Haise&#039;s. If only I could say the same for the rest of the cast, then it would have a much higher score.<br />
<br />
<br />
E N J O Y M E N T + O V E R A L L 1/10<br />
I think that what annoys me so much is the potential this show has, this show could be truly amazing if it wanted to be, it has the right material to do so. Unfortunately the studio behind it is too lazy to care and just wants to squeeze as much as the can get from the manga, instead of treasuring it and understanding how to correctly adapt the work. I have to be extremely harsh on this series because believe it or not; I WANT IT TO DO WELL!! So when it doesn&#039;t I&#039;m going to be very mad. I do not recommend this show to anyone, even if your an anime only just don&#039;t bother because the show wont make sense anyway and you&#039;ll just be confused. If you&#039;re a manga reader while it is nice to hear the characters voices and see the fights moving I still don&#039;t advise it, as it just is painfully frustrating to watch. Overall I have to give it a 1... Thank you for reading my review ( •⌄• ू )✧

    Note: This is a review coming from an anime only viewer.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:re is one heck of a series. From the start, you are taken on the world of Sasaki Haise, and the Quinx squad. The story, at the beginning, was quite confusing, having no context about the actual series at all. However, the pieces start to fall in much later, and the story gets more in depth than before.<br />
<br />
The story in here is really good, with a complex and unique story which surprisingly shocks me at some points, and makes me laugh at other points. I definitely didn&#039;t expect to cry in this, but I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281554">
        would be lying if I didn&#039;t cry at all.<br />
<br />
The art was alright. I mean, the animation and the styling done in :re doesn&#039;t match up to images of the manga that I&#039;ve seen, which looks a lot better than this, but then again, the first two seasons were just as bad.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack and the choice of really different sounds was something that really felt right. It&#039;s not the typical soundtrack that most people are accustomed to; it&#039;s different, dark, unpredictable and very suited to the story of :re.<br />
<br />
The characterisation here is another good point. The contrast of Kaneki and Sasaki is quite striking, and really well done. The Quinx squad all have their unique quirks, and I especially love how they managed to put a different spin on the characters than what I&#039;ve typically seen. The characters that were also present in the original series have clearly changed, bringing the story and characters to a different level than what I expected.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment was something I thought was alright. The series was definitely made for manga readers, and for a person like me who hasn&#039;t read past the two chapter of the original, I definitely couldn&#039;t enjoy it due to my lack of context. I think that if I knew the context better, and knew what really happened instead of what we got in Root A, then I would have definitely enjoyed it more.<br />
<br />
Overall, this series is a wonderful work, and was something I didn&#039;t expect that I would like as much as I thought. Although I&#039;m an anime only water, this has definitely incentivised me into reading the manga, and after watching the final episode, it makes me really look forward to season 2 of :re.

    For me as a long-term Tokyo Ghoul fan, the newest anime adaptation does little to redeem the troubled state the Tokyo Ghoul franchise, as a whole, is currently in. <br />
<br />
Tokyo Ghoul :re starts out strong, even if not as outstanding as the original. There&#039;s (still) the man-eating species known as &quot;ghouls&quot; terrorizing modern Tokyo. There&#039;s (still) the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG), a complex, very police-like organization tasked with protecting the populace from this menace. The job of a CCG investigator is hard: identifying a ghoul is only half the story, since ghouls will resist with superhuman abilities; prominently &quot;kagune&quot;, predatory tentacle-like appendages. <br />
<br />
While the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278874">
        original Tokyo Ghoul focussed on a group of &quot;pacifistic&quot; ghouls in hideout from merciless capture and extinction, the narrative focus of :re shifts, at first, to the CCG. We&#039;re introduced to a colorful palette of completely new investigators. There&#039;s timid outsider Mutsuki, likable simpleton Suzuki, lazy nerd Saiko (the only girl in the squad ... or is she?) and resentful careerist Urie. Our main character also appears in this underperforming CCG squad, as enthusiastic but ultimately unfit leader Haise Sasaki. <br />
<br />
Gradually, the one-dimensional ghouls-vs-investigators massacres will make place for a twisted, unpredictable narrative. Since Haise Sasaki isn&#039;t just a mediocre investigator: figures from his past will resurface -- and they&#039;re not only investigators-gone-missing from the first part, but also ghouls with a game-changing agenda. <br />
<br />
In particular, the namesake for the sequel is cafe :re, where old acquaintances are waiting for Haise to make his move. &quot;re&quot; may also reference to the one-eyed king: the legendary ghoul-human hybrid that will put an end to the dramatic inter-species war: but how? And what are the brutal ghouls of Aogiri, the human (?) elites of the CCG, the enigmatic V and the psychopathic Clowns up to? We&#039;ll find out, but as Kaneki from the original Tokyo Ghoul warned us: this story will become a tragedy.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a fantastic anime? Well, it certainly could&#039;ve been. If (!) the anime was well-produced and, more importantly, if (!) the source material (manga) had kept its shit together. My disappointment could not have been greater, as neither has proven to be true.<br />
<br />
The :re anime repeats the exact mistake of previous Tokyo Ghoul adaptations, by running through at a breakneck pace, which doesn&#039;t let story or characters breathe. The mostly great character designs from the manga haven&#039;t been built and improved upon in the anime; instead, they have been colored in a rather flat and predictable fashion, as far as I can tell. <br />
<br />
Yet, these minor complaints actually pale in comparison to my actual complaint: it&#039;s not about the anime-specific adaptation issues, as I may need more episodes to properly evaluate these. My actual complaints are about the source material, the Tokyo Ghoul :re manga series, whose deep flaws a middling anime adaption will only exacerbate. <br />
<br />
See, the original manga series used to have it all: a flashy and well-executed concept of man-eating humans, iconic art direction with memorable and unique character designs, an engaging story with a multitude factions and facets, fascinating characters, tense edgy atmosphere, references to highbrow literature done right, and, last but not least, gory over-the-top action.<br />
<br />
All of these perks placed the original Tokyo Ghoul manga far, far above yr average run-of-the-mill dragged-out-for-profit shonen action series (think of One Piece, or Bleach). Now, straight to the issue: what the sequel to the brilliant original, Tokyo Ghoul :re, turned out to be, is ... yr average run-of-the-mill dragged-out-for-profit shonen action series (think of One Piece, or Bleach). <br />
<br />
:re, currently amassing 170 or so chapters, managed to stay good for about 60, decent for about 90 and tolerable with a grain of salt for about 120 chapters. With infuriating rigor, Ishida Sui murders his story and forcefully drags its mutilated corpse so far away from the original direction that leaving it to fan-fiction aficionados may have been a kinder fate for this once great series.<br />
<br />
Starting with needless and anti-climactic deaths of his very best characters, Ishida proceeds to rush through long-awaited plot developments in the least satisfying way imaginable. Equally disappointing, populist and banal climaxes to formerly subtly blossoming romantic and personal relationships follow. What&#039;s left is a pointless and directionless exercise in continuing for the sake of continuation, as long as sales numbers permit.<br />
<br />
Along the bumpy path to ruin, we will be served city-sized monsters and banal melodrama as surrogates for psychologically compelling writing. Formerly interesting female heroines will be reduced to subservient breeding cattle, in &quot;best&quot; shonen traditions. <br />
<br />
Sound power balances will be abandoned; battles will be decided by kicks to the groin. In the increasingly rare case a confrontation becomes interesting, it HAS to end offscreen, lest this manga might become interesting again. Death flags will be ceremonially displayed in lame cliffhangers, but no one ACTUALLY dies in this manga. Unless it&#039;s an interesting and well-written character: then, its either offscreen butchering or poorly motivated suicide for ya. <br />
<br />
At his worst, the main antagonist acknowledges he had no idea what he had been doing the last 60 chapters. Well, neither does the reader. The authors&#039; self-awareness seems to slip through, as he ends his worst chapter so far with the line &quot;Stop. Just stop.&quot; <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not exaggerating. Read the manga. Or, rather -- don&#039;t. It&#039;s a tragedy.<br />
<br />
Super peace.<br />

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
0/10, Unfortunately a huge let down, an almost exact repeat of the mistakes made before, this anime is both an unusually bad adaption, sequel, and has been vastly overhyped.<br />
<br />
- Characters: 0/10 - Does what Tokyo ghoul does best, it ignores interesting characters, and instead focuses on the subpar, uninteresting ones. After establishing a bland and unchanging cast from the first series, this pointless sequel throws them all under a bus and replaces them with insert generic copy and paste characters here. This now includes the protagonist, the author waited until this sequel to reset him with a deux ex memory loss to retcon his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279537">
        development. Also with Nishio, he does get to come back but Re resets him too so, surprise, surprise he’s right back to what he was doing before. <br />
Similarly, Touka was the most popular character in popularity contests in the first manga, so naturally she had to be demoted to a side character here (remember Tokyo ghoul’s claim to infamy is that it identifies the good members of the cast fans like, and purposely boots them to the curb in favour of second rate, extra inferior characters. This fails in terms of concept, an audience would want to see cool and great characters, not insert wooden acting person or ghoul here, character wise it chose the wrong path to walk). <br />
Regarding Touka, the female lead, even though Kaneki at first fancied Rize, and didn’t give Touka the time of day, Tokyo Ghoul is somehow convinced that Kaneki would fall madly in love with the most trite, insipid person on the market. It’s because she was supposed to have her Emo black hair for Kaneki to fall head over heels in love with, so they can have a Marilyn Manson themed romance later. In a dire attempt to introduce a tender moment (Kidding you not, Touka is waiting for Kaneki to regain his memories/cut Kaneki right out her life, perfectly content with moving on without him, “two years later my life’s fine without you, seen you again, you mean nothing to me.”) It brings to mind the ‘Twilight’ comparisons, just bizarre, mismatched and wholly unconvincing attempts at romance with clumsy plastic characters, and it doesn’t work, unless it’s an Emo’s unite (spoiler, it is) series, funny that should be mentioned.<br />
Identically, Amon, the only one with some sense, a capable fighter and strategist has disappeared, again because he was a good character and, don’t forget, Tokyo Ghoul can only focus on the third rate, especially dull characters, all eyes on you Quinx squad.<br />
The added problem with this is the author already tried this by establishing the bad characters as the focal point in the first series. The animation studio made them worse than they were on paper, route √A spiral dived further underground. Now Re is out with a vengeance of a retcon, even direr characters to revolve around in the form of everyone, with the occasional call back to the least inspired props from before. It’s like some kind of aggressive belly flop to the bottom in making the poorest excuses for characters as possible, quite impressive in hindsight. “Interesting characters, and character development? What are those?” – author of Tokyo Ghoul Re, clearly. Not to be out manoeuvred the studio leaped on the bandwagon: “Nice looking, well drawn, emotive animated characters with good voices? Does not compute” – the studio’s apparent view.<br />
<br />
The other result of this is that Tokyo Ghouls main niche audience, the Emo “my life is such a black abyss” crowd have also been rejected and forgotten, by the author himself no less. I think the creator was like “it’s ok! In Re the Emo’s are gone! Even Juuzou’s had his body modifications toned down, look! Normal, ‘cool’ people now!” Disrespectful towards fans who come to this series for a certain validation (“my mom told me to do my homework, but I want to grow my fringe all over my face, I can totally relate to Tokyo Ghoul”) not to mention it remains unacceptable for anime fans that want to see something promising, and this reset couldn’t even provide it when it had the chance to attempt it. <br />
Characters, with good, bad, in between traits, whatever quirks they have, are vital to a great story; Tokyo Ghoul Re characters don’t warrant a second glance. To fail to create anyone likeable, or unlikable in a series that is supposed to flesh out the backgrounds of even minor players, there is something fundamentally unsound with the premise. The anime couldn’t even bring them to life with voice acting, expressions, or anything. How on earth an anime can be created where you don’t like a least one character and want to follow their story, hear their voice, see their expressions and who they are, I’ll never know, but Re has achieved that. <br />
Ignoring popular characters to focus on ones with even less likeability, and having no complex development in quite a harsh world that should draw something, anything out doesn’t work for a reason. It is not needed, or courageous for Tokyo Ghoul to play a necessary evil and remind manga and anime creators that sketchy characters and menial plot routes make for a subpar anime, everyone already knows.<br />
The repercussions of this, and the greater failure, is that the audience will find it challenging to become invested in a story. It’s more like looking at playing cards: that’s not Kaneki, that’s chew toy number one, there’s wall flower whoever, indeed Hide, not the best friend, rather the plot device is also missing. Whether it’s Hide, Rize, guy Mado, even a comatose Shinohara, whoever it is, the golden rule of this series is to stamp out the good characters, Tokyo Ghoul always makes that clear. <br />
<br />
- Story: what story?/10 - Decided to reset the previous Tokyo Ghoul and voila, here’s some detective, whatever the heck is going on with this plot (genre wise its a reminder of a show called ‘Descendants of Darkness’ which was effective in the sense that it done what Re is trying to do here but done it a lot better. That Re came out some time after but hasn’t added anything new to this genre is discouraging). <br />
Re’s animation couldn’t do anything for the clichéd and monotonous arcs, no need to describe the failures of the story in detail, but spoiler alert, Re is just essentially the same as the first manga. It just shows the human detective viewpoint, with the added bonus of missing good characters, the Emo’s have been white washed removed, and there is a cliché crime watch plot this time, in lieu of the fractured nonsensical one the first time round.<br />
The audience (especially those who haven’t read the manga) may not know what is going on with the story, and it’s not hard to acknowledge; you don’t actually need to care. This brief advert for the manga has too much material condensed in far too few episodes, and complicated further when there’s a fundamental detachment between the audience and this series. What does the casual viewer want to see? A bargain bucket police academy? What do the fans want? An anime where significant material has been scrapped, and a supposed seinan manga crammed into this? Have I missed something?<br />
That so many manga chapters are condensed into a 12 episode series was, quite frankly shocking to learn, and really sets the bar for the failures to come. Couldn’t even give some nice text or sentences worth listening to in this rock bottom adaption. The only suspicion is that Re was made with the express intention of being bad on purpose to big up other series, imagine: a studio could point to their other anime and say, “look doesn’t this look good in comparison to Tokyo Ghoul?&quot; Suppose it’s a shrewd business manoeuvre, it’s not like Tokyo Ghoul has any artistic integrity to preserve or risk losing at any rate.<br />
<br />
- Animation: 4.5/10 – objectively and technically speaking near average, not bad but not great either. But just not good enough especially considering other anime titles that will be commanding people’s attention. My Hero Academia continues to knock the ball out of the park, and who else is very keenly aware that Tokyo Ghoul is trying to ride on the success of Attack on Titan. Tokyo Ghoul can’t even claim to be a good filler anime until the time comes for fans of this genre, try being a good animation and build your own success by being a great series, free advice. <br />
Certain chapters of the manga are drawn reasonably well and you would have thought the anime would reflect this, or make up for the not so great parts, but major spoiler alert: you thought wrong. Just to maim the manga even more, and also ensure that the studio has matured and tried to edit out the Emo feel of, like the whole cast, they even had Touka’s haired dyed purple, not manga Goth black hair, “see! See! It’s OK for normal people to watch now!” Says the studio, undoubtedly.<br />
The animation needed to be optimal for this reboot considering the dive off the deep end the second season (route A, which is now officially irrelevant with Re, which still can’t clear up that travesty though) was, you would have thought the studio would really up their game with the animation to try and claw something back. Unfortunately, it’s clear that the good folks were like “oh its Tokyo Ghoul, here’s some basic stuff those weebs enjoy, they’ll lap up anything.” I do feel sorry for the fans, though it’s telling what the studio really thinks of Tokyo Ghoul when the environments and backgrounds are… just why, what wicked, unforgivable actions have people done to deserve this?! The Twilight/Tokyo ghoul fans deserve sympathy for them having their hopes built up and presented with this, and especially with a Spring time anime this should be top notch regardless of what it is. In hindsight, it&#039;s perfectly feasible that the creators are in fact cats, who thought they were doing good and were expecting some praise when they came in with a horribly mangled mouse/Tokyo Ghoul animation. <br />
<br />
- Sound: don’t even waste a rating/10 - sub fails to give emotions, anything at all to what should be an illustrative cast, as for the dub… just don’t, got to spare you, it’s too late for me, I’m gone, save yourselves.<br />
It’s quite obnoxious considering the Emo/Gothic niche that Tokyo ghoul is supposed to lay claim is now gone. The sound track could have been a great glue to cement that semi-unique status, the voice acting too. Honestly, it’s not certain how they could have got it so… wrong, but lets be self aware here and realise Re is a “oh splat, there you go Tokyo Ghouls all done for now, time to move on to the next project, what do I care about this series.” Not exactly reassuring, even for people who have moved on from this series but came back hoping there was something salvageable (I did want there to be something salvageable, I really did). <br />
They couldn’t even have another cheese ball of an opening song. Whilst it’s ridiculous, the male version of Twilight fans were all over the ‘unravel’ titular song from before, it reminds them of the dark times when their parents told them they have to stop dying their hair black and tidy their rooms, and they were the edgiest people alive, just ask them. But the songs here have failed to encapsulate the supposed atmosphere of Tokyo ghoul, and sound wise there’s nothing notable to enjoy or remember. <br />
A wasted opportunity in that sense, could have had music to match the tone of the series, but it is apparent this is a part of the white washing exercise to remove all traces of what fans liked from the start (must not forget the only golden rule of Tokyo Ghoul, the fans like something? It’s removed; this evidently applied not just to the story courses and characters, but has carried over to even the music as well). It was a bit suspect but it’s obvious now, we aren’t imagining things, and perhaps the writer and studio really do loathe the fans, let go of the hate people, treat your fans right, they’re the ones propping up this explosive train wreck of a show.<br />
<br />
- Homophobic undertones - (addressed) To its credit the glaring read between the lines prejudice articulated in the first manga have been acknowledged. It’s clear that the following conversation took place between the publisher and author. Publisher: “dude the whole Tsukiyama, Yamori, Nico, Souta ghoul villain thing is not subtle at all, son, people don’t use the magical N-word man, or the coin grabbing greedy Jew, or the homosexual stereotypes any more, they weren’t right then and they’re not right now. And the whole ghoul culture as an allegory for LGBT culture, with those yucky ghouls/gays out to prey on one another, who don’t have feelings for one another, who view each other as pieces of meat and only approach human/straight people to eat them/come onto them, someone will notice!” And then the author, after he had stopped frothing at the mouth, nevertheless continued to chug beakers of mercury and proudly proclaimed: “but Tokyo Ghoul is perfect! In the first manga we had Kaneki catching the ghoul/gay disease AIDS from a blood transfusion! He doesn’t have bad AIDS so it’s cool right?&quot; The author is a machine, nothing stops this train. <br />
&quot;And then! He goes over to see Tsukiyama for whatever purpose those gays/ghouls invite guys over for, (even showering before! I wonder what was going to happen?!) With the intention of having him torn apart for fun, and only spared because ‘that guy’ Tsukiyama wanted him for himself! After which Kaneki faints and wakes up on the sofa by himself, whatever occurred when he was unconscious and Tsukiyama was with him? What impression do you get?! What do you think I’m trying to tell you?!” Is or is not quite possibly the thoughts the author wants us to have.<br />
The author guides us through: “Tokyo Ghoul also explores Nishio struggling with his homosexual/ghoul desires but he rejects those foul urges and stayed with his girlfriend, a lady!” The editor, or someone who wasn’t totally clueless chimes in with “this is what happens when you don’t take your meds! We get it! Tsukiyama and especially Nico were made with the express intention of prodding our vulnerable audience to react with “yuck the horrible gays!” and the writer, giddy with excitement demonstrates how subtle he is “right! So after every arc being centrally themed around homosexuality (catching the gay/ghoul disease, Nishio inviting Kaneki and Hide, two guys back to his place where he makes his move when they’re on their own, you know? Then predatory gay Tsukiyama who just loves the smell of Kaneki, and wants to cannibalize him, just like ghouls/gays just look at you and want to be around you for whatever.&quot; <br />
Re continues in the same vein thought wise, this was after setting a foundation that Kaneki and the ghouls/gays can deny their carnal urges by drinking coffee, and resist their inner desires by being happily together with a member of the opposite sex, even when there’s little compatibility between them (Nishio and his girlfriend, Kaneki and Touka, Akira is literally thrown at Amon). <br />
The homophobic bedrock Re is built upon will bring up the past, as the author helpfully explains: “After that non stop parade, it’s time to switch things up!” Cue the daring stereotypes: Nico and Yamori, the latter who beats and kidnaps heterosexual Kaneki, after Yamori stabs Kaneki from behind with his kagune no less (can you see me ker wink) and then violates him (implied in the manga during the centipede scene) “because that’s what those awful gays/ghouls do of course! Not to mention that Kaneki learned his lesson not to approach those ghouls/gays, see Tsukiyama, but horror alert, they come and kidnap you and do what they do!” The author gives it his all.<br />
The editor, noticing that the author’s eyes had stopped rolling in opposite directions in his head must have said, “Just like straight people, LBGT people are awesome, do some good now, introduce people to offset this demonizing behaviour” to which the writer replies “of course! I’ll introduce a trans character but only because my hate infused homosexuals are horrible monsters apologue has been caught and my editor is making me do it.” This is good, greater representation is sound, but clearly Mutsuki is the result of an editor’s input rather than being present due to the writers choice, the latters views on LGBT+ people are clear, discreet as they were. <br />
The writer, having his homophobic anthem of stereotyped, crude prejudices called out, was strong armed into adapting his ways, with condescending attitudes such as: “We’ll show that Naki does care about Yamori! See! Those yucky gays/ghouls can feel human emotions too! Who would have thought?!” The author did try, and though Mutsuki has been introduced, these serious issues have not been remedied in Re. Souta, who is of course ‘fabulous’ because the author relishes his out-dated stereotypes from a bygone era, and of course the homosexuals have to be villains to be defeated. Re doesn’t do much to bring this back from the brink, indeed, in terms of grossly odd biased views it goes further over the edge! <br />
<br />
Note: (spoiler for manga, and where Re has set the stage, and will no doubt be shown in the later episodes this year) with Hide’s ‘because I love him’ comment, and with the commentary that came with Kaneki choosing Touka when fans wanted Hide (apparently Kaneki&#039;s mind was so severely damaged that he considers hat stand Touka to be the most beautiful person he&#039;s ever seen. To his credit when Arima wants to mangle someones brain, he does not mess around), first accept deepest sympathies for fans of either of these pairings. To begin with, Hide was taken out for largely the entire story, so much for that pairing, or indeed any exploration of what was clearly a special bond between Kaneki and Hide. Even Touka &amp; Kaneki shippers have a poor guy who really needs some psychological help and decent friends and loved ones around him, matched with a physically and emotionally abusive literal side bit of a character, now demoted here to a non-tier character. Be nice to Tokyo Ghoul fans, with this anime and series they don’t have much to be happy about, still the pairing options are a testament of how greatly Tokyo Ghoul can fail. <br />
As for Hide, the author’s rabid disdain of LGBT people may be the greatest clue to the outcome. It’s very subtle (lock me away for criminal sarcasm, and throw away the key) but the author is very keen to portray LGBT people as horribly as possible, whether because they’re made to be all harsh stereotypes, or through what the author makes them do and the message is resolute: ghouls/LBGT people are truly bad, and this will reflect in the treatment the author has in store for them, including Hide.<br />
<br />
We can infer that Hide is romantically attracted to Kaneki because of the appalling way that the author perceives and treats homosexual people. <br />
<br />
Can you imagine what the author thinks, and precisely what he wants his audience to deduce: “Hide is an amazing person in terms of friendship, bravery and skill, but behind that perfection he’s one of those yucky queerosexuals, and that therefore stops him being good! Turn on your dear, precious friend and hate him now because you’ve discovered he’s gay!” <br />
Though Hide is a great character, (don&#039;t make the silly mistake of referring to a Tokyo Ghoul drawing as a ‘person’, Tokyo Ghoul manga and animation has not ever, and does not bring its text and drawings on paper to life) but because of Hide’s sexual orientation he has to be relegated to a minor part in the entire series, his brief cameo on a ‘missing’ poster here says it all. Perish the thought that we can have a focus on those creatures now! But we can, only if there are negative depictions of homosexuals and have them represented badly, hence the myriad of characters like Nishio – ‘struggling’ with same sex/unnatural ghoul desire, and the crass steryotypes Tsukiyama, Nico, Yamori, Furuta, more or less every arc baddy of the day. Re lets it&#039;s hair down by plummeting head first right back into the mire with newcomers Torso, the woman hater gay stereotype that was designed to not exactly be ‘manly’ and drawn to Mutsuki “you know when those type of people meet, wink wink, nudge nudge” being the suggestion. There is also the man hating lesbian, Nutcracker, and of course the exaggerated super horrible villain of Big Madam. Big Madam, birth sex male, and the no contest parent of the year in raising Suzuya. Can you hear it? listen closely, it&#039;s there, guttural chanting from the deepest recesses of the earth: STAWP THOSE HOMOTRANSOSAPIENS! Must stop them adopting DUR children at all costs, look what they DOO!&quot; You can just about make out the token &quot;will someone PLEASE think about the children!&quot; The author delivers its hysterical, paranoid anti LGBT adoption audience a pristine example of why we can&#039;t allow LBGT adoption like ever. The author also walks the walk since Suzuya ends up dealing with that nasty awful LBGT caregiver, PHEW! Thank heavens! And then all the LGBT&#039;s were never allowed to adopt again, and the heavens opened up in a sea of sunshine and reclaimed rainbows, all thanks to Tokyo Ghoul&#039;s on point message.<br />
It&#039;s strangely awe inspiring how may blundering, degrading steryotypes of LBGT people the authors imagined, he&#039;s won every game of Bingo don&#039;t doubt it. The little rascals fervently, wackadoodle, maniacal prejudice drenched head must have been smoking as it went into overdrive to conjure the whole gang. Then there&#039;s the rest, Ghouls/gays in general are made to be horrible looking and acting, don’t forget depicted in such a heartless and sadistic manner, wanting to eat human flesh? As unnatural and revolting as wanting to be with someone of the same sex is the presumed meaning. <br />
The deeply rooted prejudice the author exhibits untoward LGBT people extends to Uta and Yomo, both single and meant to provide a theist example of how like Nishio, those evil gays/ghouls can be redeemed by resisting their impulses. Yomo is likely meant to be perceived as ‘the homosexual uncle’ (“see! Those homosexuals can be useful and they can be family! Praise me for my deep revolutionary message!”) It was more so the case for Uta if the author is associating Emo’s with homosexuals ‘deviant’ behaviour (which actually is the case in some cultures) and it’s why they’re given the time they’re given for the reader to get this poisoned, do you notice the gamma radiation, see the real story message for the whole of Tokyo Ghoul. <br />
The author also lays a heavy handed ‘code’ essentially stating that: “Kaneki as a straight person can end up experiencing the ghoul/gay scene with all its misery and horror but ended up living happily ever after, delightfully married to a lady!&quot; Never mind that it’s scrape the bottom of the barrel Touka, so long as it’s something, anything with female parts. <br />
Meanwhile his homosexual best friend Hide can look on from the side-lines because that’s the place of homosexuals in this series. Even if they are good natured then they can’t have main roles or happy endings, they exist to revolve around the straight protagonist. If Hide were heterosexual, wouldn’t be a problem, can be back-to-back with Kaneki in the thick of the plot (the way Banjou was despite him not serving much purpose fighting, or story wise, but Banjou&#039;s straight so it&#039;s cool, don&#039;t you know). But not straight? Not allowed (was also applied to the nice natured Yomo), homosexuals don’t get page/screen time in stories unless it’s in a negative light, just in case Nishio, Tsukiyama, Nico, Yamori, Naki, Torso, Nutcracker, Big Madam, Souta and goodness knows who else, didn’t give the game away. <br />
The author’s pathological sickness concerning his mind set on homosexuals is only fully realised when we see what he has happen to Hide. If you were invested in this series, and we saw more of Hide we could actually emotionally react to the terrible maiming that occurred. We see that the poor guy has much of his mouth bitten off, teeth gone, neck severely damaged needing a voice synthesiser, the lot. The author really turned on Hide like some demented animal snapping and trying to murder it’s own young after deciding Hide was that way. This was complete with the read between the lines message of “that horrific, life ruining scarring will teach Hide a lesson for trying to get close to Kaneki! Hope that teaches those homosexuals to try and kiss their friends! And kids! If you have someone who’s gay and they try and kiss you/dare to show you affection, inflict that horrible injury on them too, gay panic defence nice and legal! The gays aren’t your friends, they’re horrible monsters out to eat you/show you affection, how awful!” How awful indeed for the author to hold those toxic views, and to try and imprint them on an impressionable and resistless crowd. Make sure you’re not duped, as tough as it is to resist this very convincing propaganda. <br />
Add to the fact that truly amazing people like his best friend Hide, a really nice guy, really clever, courageous, selfless, best of them all, that Hide was reduced to a plot device, had his lower face badly mutilated for everyone to see, just because he loves Kaneki, “that will teach those filthy gays, to be gay!” (The author reinforces his concrete views by bringing Amon back, he too experienced the gay/ghoul treatment but like Kaneki he can be happily together with a woman, the ever bland Akira, oh how wonderful!... meanwhile the homosexuals/ghouls including the nice ones like Hide will end up with nothing, and that&#039;s if they’re lucky). Says a lot that the heterosexual relationships, however contrived are meant to be considered nice, and distinguishes them to the homosexual ones, say Nico who was made by the author to just see Yamori as an attractive man nothing more, but that&#039;s how they think and act, get with the program already. The series is not a fan of happy endings for ghouls/gay people, just in case you couldn’t tell.<br />
Overall we may accept the authors treatment of ghouls/LBGT people as proof that Hide does indeed love Kaneki romantically because of what the author has diminished Hide to be. <br />
Even their later reunion was to be superficially meaningless on another level, “oh hey best friend, always had my back, lost your face? Whatever I’ve got Touka now, you’re not a part of this story, still keep admiring the straight protagonist from over there, know your place now.” Leave the author at his basement dungeon lair bending over and squirting Tokyo Ghoul out of all his seeping orifices into his braying fan army of hooting human rabbit dolls, it can’t be any worse than this shoddy anime that was left behind.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Ghoul Re gets a mercy 1/10 in this area for doing something to alleviate the LGBT equivalent of all the black face racism of the past that is central to the first season. The presence of Mutsuki, better that than nothing. But as the points with ‘camp’ Souta, Tsukiyama whose entire life revolves around Kaneki, to &#039;eat&#039; him no less, and now Torso, Nutcracker and Big Madam, and especially Hide as explained above, the prejudiced undertones, well overtones now remain a central pillar of this series, and are still in the sludge filled pipeline to come. <br />
Don’t be deceived though, or lose heart, with the story, animation, the travesty of the cast, and now this, scraping Tokyo Ghoul off your boot is easy. The author can rest soundly, resolutely secure in the knowledge that he has completely and utterly failed to turn me against LBGT people. That one can immediately identify Tokyo Ghoul as not a thinly veiled jab at LGBT people, but correctly recognise this as the LBGT equivalent of some sort of crafted propaganda demonising Jewish people using crass stereotypes and behaviours. It can be viewed right now the same way we look at old racist Disney cartoons, interesting being modern, ancient history let&#039;s give it that. And appealing to the audiences suspension of disbelief to accept what is shown them, to be able to see through it all is a good skill for the audience to have. <br />
Despite the major league, full throttle conditioning (subconsciously moulding the reader to think these are the issues the ghouls/gays face, keep away from them, see how horrible they look/are, virtually every villain is some variation of a LBGT stereotype, don’t worry the good straight people all make it, but even the nice LGBT examples like Hide have to have the hammer fall on them) and the normalisation of extreme preconceptions this series espouses, Tokyo Ghoul’s efforts must prove to be futile, it would not be wise to drink from this radioactive lagoon. And though Re continues to be the must have quintessential tool for some lobotomised fear monger to illustrate how ghoul society and how all the awful villains are supposed to represent LGBT people and how detestable they are, it can fail to lay a claim to our views. For the real overarching villain isn&#039;t the LGBT/ghouls, their society or the humans, not Arima, Eto or Furuta, the true villain is well hidden within plain sight. Hint, it&#039;s in the form of the Tokyo Ghoul manga, animation, the series itself, and the foul hateful anti LGBT message it champions. <br />
<br />
- Summary - Deserves some praise because Re does actually somehow manage to be worse than both previous seasons, no easy feat considering the state they were in. Re was supposed to make it all better but it doesn’t. It could have righted the wrongs done before but it didn’t. Though there is an intuition that suspects this was done to be spiteful, not just to the fan base, but casual viewers as well (the ‘My Little Pony’ creator mocked bronies, the cast of the ‘Twilight’ movies look down on the subject material and fans, and it’s evident here that both the author and animation studio are repulsed by the Emo/Goth fan base of Tokyo Ghoul and are trying to shake them off). They also need hugs and whatever it takes therapy wise to cleanse them of their serious wrangle against LBGT people, don’t worry though who’s gullible enough to absorb anything from Tokyo Ghoul, right? It can&#039;t even patronise the viewer with some cutesy &quot;look Mom, I figured out gays/ghouls have feelings too just like us!&quot; Can we all agree to be beside our precious LGBT friends and family and disown the broken homophobes that had an accident on their failed expedition to the toilet and violently discharged Tokyo Ghoul? We can train them to be better, we’ll be that good.<br />
Additionally, Re does have a remarkable penchant for resetting the established narrative, characters and repeating the exact same events with a deux ex machine memory loss, so they can parrot entire events but with the protagonist as a detective this time, complete with new rusty old forgettable cliché characters as a bonus, whoop! <br />
This anime, in terms of plot, characters, animation, premise, everything is dull, and subpar, though nothing does dull and subpar like Tokyo Ghoul, and Re has taken that to a brand new, unprecedented tier of defective. Sorry guy versions of Twilight fans, and the Emo crowd, I actually am, for the author to cut his fan base loose, and for this series to plummet to ever greater depths must be hard, my condolences, though finding something good and leaving the series behind to wallow in it’s own squalid filth takes nothing, that’s for certain.<br />
<br />
- Overall verdict: negative points/10 – unworthy of your viewership or time, people are waking up and recognising Tokyo Ghoul as the ‘Twilight’ manifestation of anime. Identifying the male version of Twilight fans, who can see Bella and Kaneki in abusive, fake relationships with certainly no love, in no story, characters, everything is appallingly dire, why go on. Let’s acknowledge that land fills like Twilight and Tokyo Ghoul may have their fans, but that does not mean that they are good. Tokyo Ghoul is a block so shockingly deficient and worthless from a literary and personal enjoyment perspective, yet under propped up by… really nice people. <br />
Understand It’s Ok for you to feel let down by this latest soiled diaper unto our fair earth; at this point what’s important to note is that no you did not deserve this, and no it is definitely not your fault, you done NOTHING wrong to warrant this animation. Tokyo Ghoul Re was supposed to be everything to make up for the previous seasons, indeed the manga itself but, it just didn’t want to, or couldn’t. <br />
The problem is ingrained with the manga source material itself; it was already a fail by concept, character and story premise, had a reset in Re but repeated the exact same mistakes but to an even greater extent. To result in this animated abomination is an absolute travesty of our time. Try as you might you simply cannot polish excrement. You can strive to apply a glossy concealment but you can’t disguise the material that lurks underneath and forget about containing the rancid stench. You can give Tokyo Ghoul’s manga a shiny, well… at least not an eye exploding, hideous anime adaption, but the gloop within cannot be covered for long. And for all the production values, sound and animation, they sink into the heap that is Tokyo Ghoul. The good features on board go down with the ship. Whether it’s the point blank refusal to center on the appealing characters (of which there are fewer in Re) or ignore decent plot options, to choose the exact same boring story, again, Re cannot trip over the hurdles enough and repeatedly. <br />
Basic animation and voice acting can apply a cover, but what type of awful veneer is this anime? In hindsight the studio done the best with what they had to work with, and the weary and uninspired result is far from pretty. That they made a hippo mess failure of an anime, which should be safely disposed of, is actually a compliment considering the state of the actual manga. <br />
<br />
Casual viewers will likely have zero interest in the anime equivalent of an almost B-movie both in terms of the actual animation, sound and characters. Little here stands out, if you like police/detective stuff, find something that’s worth it, this will leave you hanging. <br />
Perhaps the fans can hope for an entire wipe the slate clean anime reboot, to properly polish out the swan dive to the bottom that route A was, and now this is. It happened with Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and that was astonishing, fingers crossed Tokyo Ghoul can also be redone and done as right as can be. Some people cling to anime to feel nice, that&#039;s fine, whatever makes them happy. Tokyo Ghoul, however is a life jacket made out of lead, a parachute that when opened is revealed to in fact be an anvil. Be decent and chuck people a bone here.<br />
<br />
In terms of dire, boring characters, uninspired dull plots, and always opting for the poorer choices instead of the enriching ones, nothing does it like Tokyo Ghoul. It may always be resented for choosing the worst when it could be the best, and the direction the whole dilapidated series took is a pale inferior shade of what it could have been. <br />
Re has once again used it’s tried and tested, super delicious recipe of baking a cake using ultra fresh cat vomit instead of flour, malevolent hobo droppings rather than icing, a choice collection of plague rat fur and tapeworm eggs for sprinkles, and who needs a cherry garnish when Tokyo Ghoul opts for a sublime bloated, fully loaded prolapsed rectum on top. The animation proceeded to make a malodorous finger paint, cave scribble with infected menstrual blood, savour Tokyo Ghoul to your hearts content, party people.<br />
<br />
Btw, If you’re a fan of Tokyo Ghoul make sure you watch this anime, it’s such a good adaption, you’ll be really happy, and it will be so worth it, and you’ll love it so, so much : )

    Tokyo Ghoul:re is a highly misunderstood anime. Manga readers condemn it for its rushing of the plot; anime-onlys enjoy it for its fresh storyline and decent action. To enjoy TG:re to the max, you have to find a balance between these two common opinions by acknowledging that the anime and manga are two different entities that should be viewed - and enjoyed - separately. <br />
<br />
Ishida is a phenomenal storyteller. There are a plethora of brilliant scenes that you can tell have been crafted perfectly and could not be any better. For instance, while the overall drive of the plot felt rushed and unnecessarily accelerated in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282112">
        some aspects, the focus on Haise regaining his memories was designed and paralleled perfectly with the original Tokyo Ghoul series; it made me feel nostalgic over Ken Kaneki&#039;s tragic tale. (&quot;If you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be a tragedy.&quot;) The only criticism of the story, for me, would be the rushing of the plot (and in the process) ignoring certain scenes from chapters that add to the atmosphere of the series. However, as previously mentioned, it is my belief that an anime and manga should be enjoyed - or hated - separately, in order to get the most out of it. <br />
<br />
Some people hold the opinion that the animation is lacking in particular departments. This could be referring to the action scenes, the character stills, and/or the overall art. It is true that during some action scenes, the animation could have done with a new animator. In fact, the reason as to why some animated scenes flumped is because the anime was outsourced, which means that different studios work on different episodes, so quality can, and often will, vary from episode to episode. In spite of this, it is important to remember that TG:re and TG are not action-driven works (shounen) - they are, without a doubt, character-focused stories. Even more so, I personally prefer the new colour tint and animation style when it comes to the still scenes. Especially when Haise was the main focus on the screen - he looked fucking great. <br />
<br />
One thing that distinguishes TG from other anime is its superb soundtrack. During the original TG, we were blessed with the work of art commonly known as &#039;Unravel&#039;. Its closing soundtrack, written by the J-Rock band &#039;people In The Box&#039; didn&#039;t fall behind the legacy of unravel much further, either. Ignoring the atrocity of the second season and its horrendous soundtrack, the opening song to TG:re, Asphyxia (written by Co Shu Nie) is almost as angelic as unravel. Some fans even prefer thus opening to its first, perhaps because of the chaotic buzz and fervent energy it installs in you as you watch and headbang to it.<br />
<br />
Another thing that distinguishes TG from other anime is its ability (or rather, Sui Ishida&#039;s) to construct groundbreaking characters that you can&#039;t help but adore to watch. Whether her is Haise or Kaneki, I love this character as if he were my child. Not to mention the warm and fulfilling relationship between the QS members, which is something worthy of a prize itself. But in relation to Haise/Kaneki, this character glowed brighter than any other character so far, as he does in every season he is in - because that is the final product of Ishida&#039;s hard work and spectacular storytelling.<br />
<br />
Overall, TG:re is a fantastic addition to the series. Now that the manga is coming to a close, the anime successfully provides its fans with the chance to fill their empty hearts as they wait - and beg - for another manga series in the future. As a whole, it is a work of art when you look at it from an outsider&#039;s perspective and refrain frm comparing it to the manga as an abundance of fans like to. Either way, if you read the manga or not, it is highly likely that you will find yourself enjoying the anime adaptation of TG:re, and hopefully, like me, end up adoring it. <br />

    Don&#039;t watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you&#039;ve read the manga, you&#039;ll be extremely disappointed by this mess of an adaptation. As someone who&#039;s been with :re from chapter one, I&#039;m actually appalled by how horrible this anime is.<br />
<br />
The story, although enjoyable in this part of the anime, is extremely rushed. I&#039;ve heard a lot of complaints about the pacing, and at first I excused it, thinking they&#039;d fix it by episode two, since the first episode tends to have weird pacing. But no, we&#039;re at episode five now and nothing has changed. Nothing is fleshed out, the interactions are rushed, and because of this, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279517">
        relationships between characters seem forced and fake.<br />
<br />
The animation is what you&#039;d come to expect by a Tokyo Ghoul anime. I didn&#039;t mind the original&#039;s animation as much, but I have to point out that the animation is as boring and tasteless as A1 Pictures&#039;s. No fluid movement, rushed, boring, and so many frames look dumb and wonky, I can&#039;t help but rush. <br />
<br />
I enjoy the ending song a lot, considering I&#039;m already a huge Queen Bee fan, and have mixed feelings about the opening. The music in the show is nothing to write home about- mostly just some weird synth beats that were made with no inspiration. It feels lackluster and boring and it really is. I feel like the performances of the voice actors are amongst the worst they&#039;ve done, especially Natsuki Hanae&#039;s portrayal of Haise, which sounds stiff and really forced. I&#039;m also extremely angry they decided to use a higher-pitched female voice actor for Mutsuki.<br />
<br />
Characters are the same as the manga, but are, as mentioned before, much less fleshed out. Can&#039;t say much here.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been with :re since the beginning of its serialization, and what a shitfest it&#039;s been. These first three books are my favorite, and have a special place within my heart (yes, the anime got through volumes one through three in five episodes). But I can&#039;t say I enjoy this anime at all. I love Haise, so I enjoy seeing him, but other than that, I can&#039;t find myself looking forward to the episodes every week.<br />
<br />
Overall, a three out of a ten. I&#039;ll most likely lower it.

    A couple of days ago, I decided not to wait, until the whole season comes out and there was really no way to watch another anime show so I decided to start watch.<br />
Tokyo Ghoul season 3- I will tell you honestly if I re watched the first and second season again (like 2-6 months before) then maybe my final raiting could be abit lower (6/10-7/10) but it was 3 years ago, when I watched for the first time.<br />
Okey.... lets start with&gt;&lt;<br />
OP intro 5/10- Song is like a wtf, what i was listening to???? srsly? It was so hard to ask Toru Kitajima so that he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281441">
        transfers one of his hits, like season 1 op intro music. So I skip the op intro every time I watch the series.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10- From the beginning I do not understand where is my Kaneki Ken? and end of first episode I see flashback and I immediately understood it, the story continues as it should be +/- our main hero in parallel (not knowing me) became it what they hated and fighting not by his will (first person not second Sasaki, Haise)... all this thought made me very interested.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10- I feel very satisfied with it as it is are drawn fighting episodes but if we talking about Sasaki, Haise&#039;s for his teammates then especially the two guys they could have been more beautiful but Sasaki, Haise I like even more than he was looked before now he looks like a grown man.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10- Music is also fascinated, especially this hype moment when sounded the song (unravel) and I realized that there will be something cool at the moment.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10- All the characters can be understood, nothing in them is less complicated, except one of them- Tooru Mutsuki- short and specific can not understand this is a guy or a girl :D?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10- 8 episodes in 2 days= waiting like crazy for 9 epizode.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10- It seems to me that the third season has really succeeded and I look at the fact that the fourth season will comes out this year too! Great!

    -Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime)-<br />
-Episode Watched: 4-<br />
-Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) (Season 3) Score: 3/10-<br />
-Status: DROPPED-<br />
(Seriously, Citrus was a MUCH better anime than whatever this is)<br />
<br />
So.....Tokyo Ghoul:re actually has gotten an anime series.....well.......that was a thing.....right anyways....I&#039;ve been a fan of Tokyo Ghoul ever since I started reading the manga back in high school in 2015 and ever since then I was hooked by its characters, story, world and neat little lore and everything and it pretty much became my 2nd favorite manga series of all time (All time favorite being Berserk, of course) and so when I saw the previous 2 Seasons of the anime I was beyond

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279001">
        disappointed with the whole thing.....<br />
<br />
-Season 1 adapted 7 Volumes of the manga into 12 Episodes which pretty much felt the whole thing to be a rush job and it also changed story elements both major and minor that didn&#039;t need changing in the 1st place. But the most damaging flaw was that it focused more on action than the story, world and characters.<br />
-Tokyo Ghoul (anime) (Season 1) Score: 3/10-<br />
<br />
-Season 2 titled &quot;Tokyo Ghoul √A&quot; (Pronounced: Root A), on the other hand, was an anime-original storyline that featured some story elements from the manga but painted in a different light. All of which was spun the original creator of Tokyo Ghoul: Sui Ishida. So what went wrong here? The answer was simple, the story was beyond disjointed, confusing and made no sense, the characters were basically pointless and the whole thing overall felt like a bastardization and betrayal of Tokyo Ghoul and worst of all, remember when I said Sui Ishida made the entirety of √A story? well the worst thing was that Studio Pierrot (The studio making T.G to begin with) pretty much threw Ishida&#039;s storyboards and drafts into the dirt and outright disrespected his work, granted they also did that with Season 1 but it&#039;s much more noticeable here and overall though, Tokyo Ghoul √A was REALLY BAD and no one, whether Manga Reader or Anime Watcher, should EVER waste their time with this at all.<br />
-Tokyo Ghoul √A (Season 2) Score: 1/10-<br />
<br />
So then, when I heard that Tokyo Ghoul was getting a 3rd Season was never looking forward to this whatsoever. Later on, witnessed more and more of the anime being showcase I was still never impressed but what I saw and even though it was sticking to the manga this time, like Season 1, but with no recap or anything didn&#039;t make matters any better and it seemed like Studio Clown didn&#039;t learn their lesson after all. Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) gave me the impression that it was going to be on autopilot for the entire stay and you know, THAT&#039;S a perfect description for it.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is the official 3rd Season of the Tokyo Ghoul anime series, &quot;adapted&quot; (adapted in Massive Quotes there and use that term very, VERY loosely) from the manga of the same name: Tokyo Ghoul:re (manga) which is a sequel series to the original series: Tokyo Ghoul (manga) which all done by the mangaka: Sui Ishida.<br />
<br />
---Story: 3/10---<br />
----DISCLAIMER: In order to avoid confusion for Anime Only Watchers, Listen up. This season is not connected to Season 2 whatsoever in anyway, shape or form. It is a continuation of the events that transpired in the manga. So in other words, Tokyo Ghoul √A IS COMPLETELY WORTHLESS!!!!----<br />
Set 2 years after the events of the original manga (Read the manga, the light novels and [Jack] to fully understand those said events), Tokyo has changed drastically due the influence of the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), however ghouls themselves still pose has a problem to them especially the terrorist organization: Aogiri Tree (Read the manga to know who they are) as such, the CCG has decided to start up a brand new project by created their own set of Ghoul Investigators comprised of Half-Human, Half-Ghoul Hybrids (Well, more human than ghoul to be honest, but again read the manga to fully understand) known as the &quot;Quinx Squad&quot; (or &quot;Quinx&quot; or just &quot;Qs&quot; for short) in order to fight off the ghouls while being led by their mentor, Rank 1 Ghoul Investigator: Haise Sasaki (Who is EXACTLY who you think he is) who has mysteriously suffered from amnesia as he can&#039;t seem to remember 20 years of his past life. (Again. He is EXACTLY who you think he is).<br />
-Anyways, despite the fact that this show is &quot;adapting&quot; Volumes 1-5 of the manga into 12 Episodes (Just like Season 1), it doesn&#039;t excuse the fact that the story and overall writing for the was just straight-up flimsy, unlike its original source material, this isn&#039;t a deep story and there&#039;s literally nothing here. A MASSIVE amount of story felt like it was removed (and that&#039;s because it is). A lot of moments and element from the manga have been completely removed and changed and what was &quot;adapted&quot; from the manga even I knew they would screw up at, so any tension, character development, lasting impact and even symbolism is entirely removed. But on top of that, for Anime Only Watchers, they&#039;re going to get EXTREMELY confused when they watch this show because they won&#039;t know what&#039;s going on here and to make things even worse the show starts off as if everyone knows about what happened previously....NOT A GOOD SIGN and also LITERALLY NOTHING is ever explained and the whole thing feel completely rushed, even more so than Season 1. Seriously, though did the writer just fall asleep or just not give a shit?.....But anyways, I&#039;m not gonna put too much energy into this simply because not much energy felt like it was placed into this. Tokyo Ghoul........could be enjoyable as its on anime series but with an anime series like this you can never really tell sometimes. However, if we&#039;re allowed to go back to that early comment I made about Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) feeling like it&#039;s on autopilot....I wasn&#039;t just talking about the story....-<br />
<br />
---Characters: 3/10---<br />
The characters are mostly comprised of returning characters like Kishou Arima, Akira Mado, Touka Kirishima, Juzou Suyuza, Hinami Fueguchi, Ayato Kirishima, so on and so forth and new characters like Karao Saeki, Miza Kusakari and of course, the Ouinx Squad: Rank 2 Investigator: Kuki Urie, Rank 3 Investigator: Ginshi Shirazu, Rank 3 Investigator: Tooru Mutsuki, Rank 3 Investigator: Saiko Yonebayashi and finally our protagonist: the amnesic Rank 1 Investigator: Haise Sasaki (Who is EXACTLY who you think he is). While all of this may sound like good idea on paper, it&#039;s terribly executed in practice because none of the characters both old and new aren&#039;t really that interesting most of them are either undermined, uninteresting or just flat out unlikable with no rhyme or reason. Most of the character&#039;s personal motivations make absolutely no sense and it leave you scratching your head wondering why any of what they&#039;re doing is happening in the 1st place and none of their actions at all make any sense. Which is left a very empty feeling. In fact, the characters are just there for the sake of being there. (Seriously, the manga got the characters right so what&#039;s this show&#039;s excuse?). Also, one more THE OPENING SPOILED THE ENTIRE SHOW&#039;S PLOT. I MEAN, WTF!?!?!<br />
<br />
---Art &amp; Animation: 2/10---<br />
Studio Pierrot is once again making Tokyo Ghoul and this time around they&#039;re not even trying. The art and visual style is a massive downgrade compared to Season 1, √A and even the manga for the matter. Everything looked extremely cheap from the environments to the character design everything just looks half-assed and color palette looked completely muted, almost like the studio&#039;s ink cartridges ran out of ink and forgot to go resupply at the office depot. Seriously, Season 1 at least looked like it had some effort placed into it. The animation is some of the worse the series has ever produced it&#039;s completely stiff, unnatural and empty and overall nothing is really impressive in anyway, I mean, Good God even the action scenes suck, the action in the show in is barely any actual movement but it instead a bunch of still frames and slideshows that you can easily make in Mircosoft Powerpoint as a mid-term project. Sometimes there are a few times where the visual are pretty nice but still though overall, this is just not a pretty show to look at. Also, Touka once again has Purple Hair when in the manga she has Black Hair and later in early :re she has Light Blue Hair.....I mean, WTF!!!<br />
<br />
---Sound:9/10---<br />
If there&#039;s always one actual good thing about the previous 2 Seasons was the GORGEOUS Soundtrack and Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is no different. Yutaka Yamada once again returns as the composer for Tokyo Ghoul (anime)&#039;s soundtrack and it&#039;s just as amazing as ever and it&#039;s overall fits the overall themes of Tokyo Ghoul, sporting some great piano and techno pieces and some amazing vocal tracks. As for the Opening and Ending Songs, Tokyo Ghoul (anime) has always had amazing songs as Unravel by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure, Munou (Incompetence) by österreich (which I&#039;m might by the only one who actually did like the song) and Seasons Die One After Another by amazarashi (The only song I did like was The Saints by People in the Box because I thought it was pretty dull). For Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) the songs this time around are: asphyxia by Cö shu Nie and HALF by queen bee and both songs are really incredible and fit very well with the early stages of Tokyo Ghoul:re. <br />
<br />
In terms of Voice Acting, the Japanese Voice Acting and the fit their individual characters quite I especially did like the performances of Natsuki Hanae, Kaito Ishikawa, Yuma Uchida, Natsumi Fujiwara, Ayane Sakura, Yu Kobayashi, Daisuke Namikawa, Takahiro Sakurai and Mamoru Miyano as Haise Sasaki/Ken Kaneki, Kuki Urie, Ginshi Shirazu, Tooru Mutsuki, Saiko Yonebayashi, Karren/Kanae von Rosewald, Kishou Arima, Uta and Shu Tsukiyama respectively. Overall, the Japanese Voice Acting is overall really good.<br />
<br />
The English Voice Acting, on the other hand, was pretty weak none of the performances impressed me in anyway and voices themselves range from just fine, to boring or in the case of Daman Mills as Ginshi Shirazu just plain awful. On top of the almost none voices don&#039;t fit very well the characters themselves with only 3 expectations: J. Micheal Tatum as Shu Tsukiyama, Brittany Lauda as Miza Kusakari and Jeannie Tirado as Karren/Kanae von Rosewald, while I could&#039;ve gone without the German accent but I think it kinda works. But still, I never did watched the previous 2 Seasons in English beforehand but if this seasons English Dub is anything to go by then I dodged a bullet I suppose.<br />
<br />
Overall, The soundtrack is once again absolutely amazing as ever and it&#039;s easily the single good thing from this show. As for the voice acting, this is the very 1st anime series where I prefer the Japanese over the English, so I really won&#039;t recommend the English Dub.<br />
<br />
---Verdict---<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) just its predecessors is the living definition of misused potential, like I said earlier, Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is basically on autopilot from beginning, middle to end. This show is going back to &quot;adapting&quot; the manga like the 1st Season but like that Season Pierrot&#039;s means of doing so are means of subtraction of designs, themes, characters, core mechanics, story elements everything feels lesser here. If anyone are fans of the manga or otherwise DO NOT watch Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) and the previous 2 Seasons, there&#039;s no excuse for such a sloppy execution as an adaptation of the manga: it fails, as an anime series on its own: there are so many better options. If you like anime as much as the next guy or girl, Don&#039;t bother wasting your time with this series (and read the manga). Black Clover offered a better experience than this although I&#039;d easily recommend My Hero Academia, Full Metal Alchemist, DARLING in the FRANXX and Citrus way above that show.<br />

    Compared to the prequels, be it the anime or the manga, this is nothing alike. The story just doesn&#039;t keep me entertained anymore, the action is mediocre and everything is just messed up. I tried to continue watching the series, but everything that made TG special was broken in TG:re. There is NO consistency and no intelligence. I feel like a foolish child watching this, not because I am one, but because the anime makes me feel so. The art and sound is average, but everything that makes the anime enjoyable is not there. That&#039;s all, I had to drop it.

    --There is no Tokyo Ghoul:re spoilers below--<br />
<br />
What the hell was this season. Ok so first off how can an anime which was goated in the first two seasons go from being goated to being absolute trash? Like when i was watching it i was always waiting for the episodes to be over and hoping that whenever i finished an episode, the next one would be better. But no, this season was just not it. It sucked in so many ways that i cannot describe. Tokyo Ghoul:re season 1 and season 2 were definitely absolute trash. I don&#039;t even know anyone who acually likes TG:re. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372232">
        has a very bad story, very bad character development, enjoyment was a 3/10. The only good thing in it was the animation. Let&#039;s not even talk about the final fight. Like in the first two seasons the final fights were FIRE. The final fight in this seasons was so trash that it made me believe that it was one of the worst fights in all of anime. Heck i even enjoyed Darling in the FranXX more than this (no offense to DITF fans but the ending ruined it for me).

    Tokyo Ghoul: Re I did not much care for this one until the middle, it seems like the story had no thought at all put into it, and the characters personalities seemed liked they were just threw together in a hurry, with no thought put in mind. It is like this sequel was quite rushly put together to say the least. The whole thing just seem like a pile of confusion to me. It went from ass kicking to random missions without any real purpose for what those missions were really for besides random executions. I found the whole thing kinda boring.

    The show pretends that it is going to be something fresh, then yanks the rug from under you. More of the same, but less enjoyable. It brings back old characters who maybe play a larger role later, but at the beginning seem to be there because they already existed in the first 2 seasons.<br />
Certain elements are very apparent immediately from the start, making me care less about the main character. Speaking of caring less, I care even less about the tensions between humans and ghouls since most of the main cast is some form of in-between, which just displays to the viewer that the tensions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280526">
        are less than they were, when really they were supposed to be more.<br />
<br />
In general, less enjoyable than the first 2 seasons. Don&#039;t bother.

    I cannot believe this, it is worse than the second season. Yeah, they somehow managed to do the unthinkable.<br />
<br />
Story-2/10<br />
Half the episodes are over and I am yet to find something resembling a story. It is just a series of disjointed events.<br />
<br />
Art-3/10<br />
It just keeps getting worse with time.<br />
<br />
Sound-4/10<br />
Opening is skippable and the osts are not that special. Ending completely ruins the mood of the anime.<br />
<br />
Characters-1/10<br />
By far the worst part of the anime(which is saying something). The new mc feels like a pussy compared to Kaneki(I hope I was kidding,but that&#039;s the truth).Not a single character whom you can root for.Most of the people do things just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281426">
        because they are crazy.One loli has been inserted into the show and she does nothing but irritate everyone and waste time.<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion,this anime is horror for anime-onlys and comedy for manga readers.<br />

    You&#039;re probably wondering whether or not I&#039;m being serious about such a low score. Long story short, yes this show is really that bad. Frankly, at times I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes while watching this. I hope that after reading this review you&#039;ll see just how bad this show is yourself. <br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Now, at that point most reviewers would recap the plot of the show, albeit in very broad terms to avoid spoilers and such. But here&#039;s the problem: this show has no plot. None. A thing happens, the characters respond to it, then they fight it out. Rinse and repeat. This has been a formula

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284986">
        for the second season as well, and surely enough it&#039;s back this season with no changes to it being done.<br />
It doesn&#039;t go anywhere, and even if character arcs are present, there&#039;s still no sign of an overarching narrative to tie them all together. Any story, in its essence can be divided into the beginning, the middle and the end. While Tokyo Ghoul certenaly had a beginning, we don&#039;t have a slightest idea if it progresses anywhere. The episodes feel disjointed and abrupt, pacing is all over the place. That is, however, the least of my problems with the series and this season in particular. Moving on to the <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Unlike the previous section I can at least say something about the characters of this show. While many of them are underdeveloped and bare-bones, it&#039;s definately the strongest aspect of the show. And by strongest I mean it&#039;s not completely abscent or all around terrible. <br />
Before talking about individual characters I want to adress by far the most outrageous aspect of the show. A lot of the episodes feature characters that were never introduced, but treated by the show like they have been, or like they matter. An episode can literally start with characters framed like we&#039;re supposed to care about them or at the very least know them. A lot of them end up dying dramatically, even though the viewer couldn&#039;t possibly have cared. I even ended up rewatching the previous episodes&#039; endings to make extra sure I didn&#039;t miss an episode or two on accident. I didn&#039;t. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s because half of the episodes got cut out from the show, or because the writers expect the viewers to be familliar with the source material or any other reason, it&#039;s simply unforgivable. With that out the way, let&#039;s talk about some of the more prominent characters. <br />
The Main Protagonist -- Is it even a spoiler to just call him Kaneki rather than Haise? I mean it was obvious from the start. And yet I don&#039;t feel like calling him by his real name. Why? Because Ken Kaneki is not even a character. They change him up, seemingly at will every single season, to the point where his name doesn&#039;t belong to any character. Kaneki from season one and Haise from season 3 are two completely diffirent characters, no matter what the writers want you to believe. Haise himself is incredibly dull, he lacks a character arc and prominent traits, unless caring for his friends a lot counts as one. You knew what was gonna happen to him, I knew what was gonna happen to him, so he really lacks any sort of hook. This guy is really hard to care about on any level. <br />
Urie -- he&#039;s the best character this season, but once again, &quot;the best&quot; as in not entirely dull or boring. He has a character arc, complete with a motivation and a goal. Sure, it&#039;s all basic, but it exists and I have to commend the effort. His only gimminck of being an egoistical hypocrite still gets old very fast. <br />
Saiko -- the token loli. She&#039;s listed as the main character in on the title page, but doesn&#039;t do anything. She can usually be found playing vidya or running around aimlessly with that big goofy-looking hammer. She&#039;s hinted to have an amazing power, but when she does it, it&#039;s kinda meh. <br />
Tooru -- no idea if it&#039;s a guy or a gal, either way had a lot of time devoted to him in the beginning of the season, only to be entirely forgotten about in the end. <br />
Shirazu -- the opposite of Tooru. Had nothing going for him at the beginning, only to rapidly develop a storyarc near the end. His only piece of characterization is having shark teeth.<br />
Juuzou -- I&#039;m only talking about him because he was my favorite character of the second season by far. Not only was he the only character to feature a proper arc and any sort of nuance to him, he also wasn&#039;t too boring in a fight. However, that was the last season (whitch was almost as bad as this one by the way). Here, Juuzou is a dissapointment, honestly. They skipped his character development to its conclusion, and so this season nothing happens to him. Even his fights have gotten boring.<br />
Shuu -- absolutely irrelevant as a character, despite having a hude arc of his own. I don&#039;t really get why I&#039;m supposed to care about anything that&#039;s happening to him, he was never even likable to begin with. Since his very first appearance in season one, he wasn&#039;t shown to have a single redeeming quality as a character. <br />
Well, that about covers most of the relevant ones, now onto the reason I can&#039;t see anyone ever enjoying this show: <br />
<br />
FIGHTS AND ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Every action-driven anime lives and dies by the execution of its fight scenes. And by execution I mean everything in them, not just choreography and animation. Nontheless, if I had to start somewhere, I&#039;d start with animation in general. It&#039;s all over the place, ranging from being legitimately not bad in some fighting scenes to being insulting in more somber moments. The low point to me was in episode 3 or 4, where, durning a conversation, animators used shot-reverse shot in such a way, that the speaking characters&#039; mouth would not be visible. When it was their turn to talk, we&#039;d only see their back, and not their face. I wish I was kidding. That being said, when the action heated up, the animation sometimes followed suit, for the more important battles. And that would even be sort of fun to watch, if not for two reasons: <br />
Firstly, I had a hard time caring about any of the characters because of the reasons described in the previous section. And even without that, I couldn&#039;t enjoy the action at the most basic level because, secondly, there was no stakes. Let me elaborate. The ghoul powers are basically never put in any sort of easy to understand but concrete enough to follow bounds. Because of that, the viewer is never sure what&#039;s dangerous and what&#039;s not. At the writer&#039;s whim any hit can hurt the characters badly, or be completely ignored by them. <br />
Is a gaping hole in your abdomen bad? What about being sliced in half? There are no answers to that. It&#039;s unknown just how much can the characters endure before going down, so you can&#039;t even follow the battles from that perspective. Some can die from a fairly normal looking wound, some can withstand being dismembered. You never know, so naturally, you never care.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, I couldn&#039;t even enjoy watching this show just to laugh at how bad it was, like I can with some other ones. It was a chore all the way through. I can&#039;t, with good faith, recommend this show to anyone.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and the sound was kind of alright, the OP was even good at times.

    [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]<br />
<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:re was just a disappointing<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:re&#039;s storyline is just messy and rushed. As a fan of the Tokyo Ghoul manga, I feel like they skipped parts of character introduction making Haise/Kaneki very dense. This also applied to the new characters they introduced, they also feel very dense compared to the manga. <br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art/animation for Tokyo Ghoul:re gets worse and worse the more you watch and compare to seasons prior this utterly garbage adaptation. The animation has low definition and low frames compared to previous seasons. This causes the fight scenes to not look as good as I personally expected as I had high

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380227">
        hopes from the manga.<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Sounds<br />
Tokyo Ghoul is pretty well known for its iconic OST such as &quot;Unravel&quot; and &quot;Licht Und Schatten&quot; but all of its potential was wasted this season as almost all of the OST this season will be forgotten.<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment + Overall<br />
My overall enjoyment for Tokyo Ghoul:re was atrocious, the storyline and visuals were disappointing compared to the great manga series. This is an ambitiously failure of an adaptation of a good manga series. If you&#039;re planning on watching Tokyo Ghoul in general, read the manga instead.<br />
5/10<br />

    I am going to be reviewing Tokyo Ghoul:Re as purely an anime and judge it based on its merits as simply that. Not some appendage meant to supplement its source material. This has been my approach when viewing seasons 1 and 2, which is why I enjoyed them for the most part (to the dismay of manga readers). Who knows? Coming in as a blank slate probably made it slightly easier for me to enjoy them. The world we were introduced to was lucid and well-established right from the first episode of season 1. The story was elaborate and well-paced, the character dynamics and relationships

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283735">
        were complex. The voice acting was emotionally laden and three dimensional. The music was superb and probably the best part of both seasons. While the animation, though tolerable, was possibly the weakest aspect. All in all, season 1 was a great watch and season 2 was not far behind.<br />
<br />
You would think I would’ve been overjoyed by TG:Re based on how I felt about its predecessors. And I was when it was announced. I stayed away from the manga for good measure here as well, so as to stay open minded just in case they opted for some creative liberties. Pointless. Tokyo Ghoul:Re was just difficult for me to watch... Part of why this was the case for me is that I kept convincing myself that it would get better. That somewhere in the episodes to come the writers would get on their feet and find their stride, that the studio was still setting us up for one huge payoff mid series. Just something. I kept making excuses to keep from losing interest and filling my head with as many excuses as I could conjure up until all that hope dissipated and I was left to confront my denial and convince myself that season 3 was a betrayal that should never have even happened. Everything that I loved about the first two was gone. They stripped it, left it unrecognizable and with nothing for it to stand on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Never mind that I didn’t know where Kaneki had gone much less that he was still the lead of this series lodged in there somewhere, or what happened to all the other members of Anteiku and why Hinami wasn’t a part of it anymore. It didn’t take me long to figure out that the narrative had shifted and that the story would continue to unfold from the perspective of the CCG and its mish mash of new albeit incompetent faces. The story ran amok with no discernible direction. <br />
<br />
With so much ground work laid from previously, it looked like none of that mattered here. It felt like a reboot more than anything else, but what really infuriated me was how it acted like we would somehow carry all that emotional package that season 1 and √A worked hard to build in its audience and adapt it to an unfamiliar setting with a landscape of characters we don’t even know let alone care about. It doesn’t take the time to establish any of its characters or why they mean what they do to one another and by extension, the viewer. When you have a death take place and you want it to elicit an emotional response from me but instead you get a “what on God’s beautiful earth is going on here?” then you ought to know that you lost a good moment to score points with me. Little two-minute flashbacks before killing someone off with the background characters watching in horror and disbelief doesn’t mean I’m going to follow suit. You legitimatelyscrewed up. If you’re going to start from scratch with a whole new palette of characters to kill off no matter how much I want you to win, emotional reactions are earned.<br />
<br />
The dialogue was another culprit that emptied this show of any evidence that I am on this show&#039;s side. It was so bad it made the voice acting seem awful. I know for a fact that the fault was in the writing because I looked up the cast and all of them are very capable voice actors with extensive work much of it laudable. These are all talented people who know what their doing if given decent material to work with. And no amount of talent could save it, unfortunately. <br />
<br />
But the music, of everything else that was done horribly wrong was the one biggest assault against the body of work that got me interested in the anime. I was shocked to learn that Yutaka Yamada composed the score here. He scored the previous seasons and did an amazing job of elevating even the most mediocre scenes and turning them into something to reflect on while holding back tears. Nothing akin to that here. This was the laziest score I’ve ever heard since the decline of Hans Zimmer in Hollywood. Even Yamada was utterly uninspired by the events of TG:Re. He has unapologetically done away with the sophisticated symphonies that accentuated the mood of first two seasons. His “compositions” here are, as if in protest, simple synth beats just as hollow as everything else about this show.<br />
<br />
The animation was never Tokyo Ghoul’s strongest factor, but with nothing else going for it, it seems to me to be unwise to lower your standards at that as well. The character designs were pretty basic with faces constructed from rudimentary shapes meant for colour in books. The action sequences are the notorious one frame movements that don’t spark any tension. They don’t feel even mildly exciting or rewarding in the few places they have been sprinkled in. They look like an afterthought of some sort much like the music.<br />
<br />
I really wanted this show to be good. I believed what was done before it was a work of art that though wasn’t flawless, was honest in its intentions to take us on an adventure. I have vehemently defended the anime against its own manga fans for years but I can’t stand behind this and still claim to be an anime fan. I stand on the side of art that showcases passion. Whether it stays true to the source or not is immaterial to me personally. The effort just has to be there. I don’t know what this was, sadly. I just couldn’t recognize any of this. But what I could spot could be summed up in one word: Lazy.
