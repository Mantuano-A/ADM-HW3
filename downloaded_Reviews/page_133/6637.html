    **REVIEW IS OUTDATED. IT&#039;LL BE UPDATED ONCE I FINISH THE ANIME**<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not the type of person to sit down and write reviews, but seeing as this astounding show has such a low score here on MAL, I want to clear some things up: While having musical knowledge really gives you an insight on the puns and references, you don&#039;t need it in order to enjoy it to its greatest. The jokes are top-quality, the art style is stupendous, and the characters absolutely make this show.<br />
<br />
ClassicaLoid is about certain famous composers, such as Beethoven and Mozart, who have been &quot;resurrected&quot; into the modern world. Obviously not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235868">
        as reflections of how they looked in the past, but their characters are based off the personality of the composer they are based off.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, this is definitely a very trippy and wacky show, having more jokes than it does a story. The &quot;plot&quot; is really more of background fodder, which explains why these guys are here, but up here &#039;til episode 11, it hasn&#039;t really had much of an effect on the story itself... Kind of. Whatever the case, this is definitely more of an episodic anime over a storyline one, so every episode has its own little mini &quot;story&quot; and without a doubt, you will always be experiencing one or two laughs along the way. Probably more. Most likely more. At the end of the day, the characters are all just so simply lovable and charming, and they definitely make this a show more than watch-worthy.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t let the low score steer you away from this astounding show. It&#039;s crazy and weird, but in a good way. This show definitely deserves a wider audience.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll edit my review once the show finishes airing to give a better review : &gt;

    Classicaloid is about all the great classical composers brought to life, not exactly but you can see Beethoven and Mozart. They have this mysterious power called musik. As it appears they were made for an unknown reason. It&#039;s a very funny and light show with some some action now and then. The best part is Beethoven&#039;s unnatural obsession with gyoza. You can relax and enjoy the comedy and the remix of famous classical pieces of music. The art isn&#039;t fancy but it goes well with the story. The Classicaloid characters are enjoyable and interesting to watch. Classical music lovers in particular will enjoy this show

    As a classical musician, I was really thrilled with the premise of this anime. I was excited to see what kind of characterization would take place and how each composer&#039;s music would be adapted in a modern day context.<br />
<br />
With that said, I couldn&#039;t finish the first episode the first time around. I wasn&#039;t quite ready for the experience ClassicaLoid was trying to give me. We&#039;ve got a rambunctious house full of maladjusted geniuses. There&#039;s a lot of fun, a lot of chaos, and a lot of music. Once you commit to the madness though, you&#039;re in for an interesting ride.<br />
<br />
The Story - 5; Without any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246604">
        spoilers, I must say that the story is a bit weak and takes a bit to unfold. I&#039;m almost sure that the storyline intentionally takes a backseat to the comedic antics and absurdity that makes the backbone of this show. The last two episodes really floored me, honestly. You watch an anime like this for the experience, not the story. <br />
<br />
Art - 8; I really like the style and think it works well. Love how each character really has their own aesthetic. Beethoven is undoubtedly Beethoven. What&#039;s also nice is that the style remains consistent and there&#039;s little/no change in quality over the span of the series.<br />
<br />
Music - 6; Man, was I let down by some of the arrangements featured in this show. Instead of lamenting some of the weak music, I&#039;ll highlight what I did like. The arrangement of the &quot;Alla Turca&quot; from Mozart&#039;s Piano Sonata No. 11 into a &quot;Thriller&quot; mashup was borderline genius and hilarious. The story behind and presentation of &quot;Fur Elise&quot; was also hilarious. These two alone kinda overshadow some of the duds and really heightened the comedy for me.<br />
<br />
Characterization - 6; This is a tough part to talk about because it&#039;s probably my biggest gripe with the show. Some characters are done nicely, even if their antics get repetitive or annoying--namely Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, and Tchaikovsky. Some characters are too one-dimensional for my liking, though. I would&#039;ve liked to see more out of Chopin, especially his friendship with Liszt. Schubert is basically thrown under the bus from his introductory episode until episode 21. It&#039;s a shame he was made to be not a whole lot more than a Beethoven fanboy, when he was quite a composer in his own right historically. It started to grate my nerves how lazy the script would get at times, with Schubert doing nothing more than agreeing with Beethoven or shouting &quot;sempai&quot; intermittently. There&#039;s a lot more content to explore with these characters and their musicality outside of odd quirks (like Beethoven wanting to create his own guitar...) wasn&#039;t explored a whole lot, which is disappointing, especially with the Musik they wield not having as much context without the whole notion that, hey, these men lived and died by their music.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6; Many enjoyable moments, but not an anime to be taken seriously or to go into with any expectations whatsoever. The first few episodes are slow, but as soon as you get the first inkling of an idea that this series might be as nuts as it is, you might be hooked.

    This anime is made by sunrise the same studio who make gintama and gundam. <br />
This anime is really underrated im watching this thanks to some highlited reviews that give score 9&amp;8.<br />
If u&#039;re fan of comedy well u will not be disappointed dont be fooled by music genre or classical music story plot! No its not focused on classical music at all! Idk why this anime get only 6,5. <br />
<br />
Firstly the art is amazing 10/10 for some reason I feel nostalgic when see this anime art. the art is like that you see on epic adventure fantasy anime like letter bee,gosick for example but at the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245134">
        same time it have a modern style too like sad anime anohana or ano natsu de matteru. Its like blend of both of it and its like an art for epic anime. But the art style is rarely used these days and you will see the hint of gintama in this anime. The way they make the jokes,characters, and even how the characters grinning are similar.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
I thought that this will be some serious music anime with little comedy but the comedy are so funny and whacky the first 2 min watching this u will already laughing or grinning at least. And this anime should have slice of life genre it have heartwarming story.<br />
it doesnt constantly tell about music but the characters life,pasts,family and friends too. The good news is we got 25 eps of it! So you will have quite long journey to the whacky comedy world, heartwarming slice of life story plot and some music. <br />
<br />
I can say that this anime is an undiscovered gem.

    Music is a universal language, but nobody understands Bach.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Famous composers have come to life (again) to do…something. The plot is very thin with this anime. There is an actual purpose for the creation of the Classicaloids, but it’s irrelevant for most of its run. Only within the last 2 or 3 episodes does something reminiscent of a plot happen, until then we are treated to a lot of episodic nonsense. I found the comedy to be very repetitive, it’s basically one of the Classicaloids acting like a total numbnut, causing a massive chaos or one of them gone missing and the others (for whatever reason)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246885">
        wanting them back. The introductory episodes in the beginning of the series were the best in my eyes, since the characters were still fresh by then and the interactions not stale yet. While many anime nowadays suffer from being only 1-cour, Classicaloid would have done so much better if it was, instead we get a heavily dragged out 2-cour anime that gets boring way too fast.<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It’s…colorful. That’s almost all the positive things I have to say about the art. The characters look somewhat clunky and unreal with those big borders around them. There are tons of off-model shots as well. The animation isn’t much to brag about either, only the times the Classicaloids use their powers look slightly appealing, but after a while these effects start to lose their charms. I sometimes got the feeling Studio Sunrise is trying to produce a Trigger show but they don’t know how to do that, but I have a wild imagination, so don’t take this as a fact. Bottom line, Classicaloid looks very cheap and lackluster and it doesn’t feel like the animation department was very ambitious with this show.<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
An anime about music should sound extraordinary good, shouldn’t it? Well, not really. Obviously, we get to hear a lot of classical compositions of the characters’ namesakes, but unfortunately they are mostly mediocre at best J-Pop mixes of said pieces. There are a few positive exceptions, like Mozart’s Turkish March remixed with Michael Jackson’s Thriller or the show’s version of Swan Lake, but most of them sound very lame. The voice acting is okay mostly, there’s nobody doing a bad job there. The opening song falls into the same category as the rest of the soundtrack while the endings are just reprises of songs used in the respective episode. I mean, it’s cool they use all those classic pieces at all (and possibly teach young viewers about their composers), but it could have been done so much better.<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The composers are portrayed as exaggerations of the originals. Mozart for example is a carefree, childish ladies man, Tchaikovsky is a grumpy alcoholic and so on. This may get old really fast (and it does), but it’s not that much of a problem. I was much more horrified by the sheer amount of dickery they evince towards each other and even more towards Kanae. That poor girl is forced to let them stay at her house, she does all the housework, cleans, cooks, washes, and all they ever do is make her life as miserable as possible. The same goes for Sousuke, who is basically a humanoid parasite. Maybe the show would have been more enjoyable if it had more likeable characters.<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
There are tons of anime that should be 2-cours or more, but are forced to squeeze themselves into 12 or 13 episodes. Classicaloid is the exact opposite. At least half of the episodes were screaming “FILLER!” into my face, provided one beliefs that this show has an actual ongoing story. Classicaloid CAN be funny at times, but these times are so rare, that it just bored me most of the time. I mean, just look at how lackluster this review is. It didn’t hurt to watch and I didn’t want to end my life or anything, but if I had another chance, I would choose not to watch it again. Maybe you will enjoy it much more, who knows, humor is subjective after all.<br />
3/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
3.2/10

    Classicaloids is. A lot to take in. It&#039;s not good, BUT it&#039;s fun. It&#039;s extremely fun, and the colors, sounds, and characters are all enjoyable, even if the story is just off the wall unusual. <br />
<br />
Classicaloids is, in short, about the clones? Reborn versions? Of classical composers like Mozart, Chopin, Schubert, ect. Living in the modern era with their creators(?) daughter in a huge mansion. They are all bubbly, fun, colorful, and completely different from one another, finding their happiness in daily life while also occasionally turning into classical music-themed magical girls and boys. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not a great anime, it&#039;s not even in my top

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273221">
        ten, but I enjoyed it so thoroughly that I couldn&#039;t bear to give it a score below 7. If you want an anime that&#039;s colorful, fun, and musical, i&#039;d highly suggest it.

    (this is my first review, please don&#039;t bully)<br />
<br />
well, this sure was a ride,and one that i enjoyed a lot!<br />
<br />
Story 8/10: <br />
Kanae is a young girl who just inherited her grandmother&#039;s house, but for some reason, Beethoven and Mozart are living there. <br />
no, they aren&#039;t the actual Beethoven and Mozart, they are classicaloids, artificial humans created in order to &quot;create the perfect instrument&quot; and have the power of musik, a magical girl-ish power that happens when they have strong feelings. <br />
Yes, this is a mess, but one that i enjoyed a lot! the show follows a mostly episodic format with one and another that creates an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257851">
        actual story, the comedy is splendid but really ridiculous and childish at times, to enjoy this anime you need to be chill and don&#039;t take it that seriously<br />
<br />
Art 7/10:<br />
Those bright and colorful colors were what got me here in first place, everything is so colorful and bright it hurts my ayes(and i love it), the drawing style in general is super cartoony and goes really well with the show in general. the animation is ok, it gets better when the &quot;musik&quot; scenes happen, but none than that is just fine. <br />
<br />
Sound 9/10:<br />
i must say i&#039;m not an expert in music, but this show&#039;s OST is one of my favourites of all time. All the songs( except from the opening, that is a really nice instrumental piece) are sampled versions of classical music mixed with pop-ish sounds and lyrics that are most of the time way deeper than what you expect. Voice acting is good too, nothing else i can say. <br />
<br />
Characters 7/10:<br />
they could be deep...could. All the characters are just exaggerated versions of their real life counterparts, Beethoven is an impulsive dude who gets obsessed over things easily, Mozart a care-free pervert, Schubert a gentleman obsessed with his senpai and so the lists goes on. i loved every single character in the series, but i think they deserved a lot more of development(we don&#039;t see any development for Schubert until episode 21 for example)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10:<br />
As i said, this was a ride i enjoyed a lot. i haven&#039;t laughed that much with an anime since nichijou, and it made me feel happy! when i saw that lot of negative comments i thought i wouldn&#039;t enjoy this, but man i did. Sit down, relax and enjoy classicaloid, even if it&#039;s ridiculous and surrealist, just fall in love with the musik. <br />
<br />
Overall rating: 8, nothing near perfection but enjoyable nonetheless

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
When I was in high school, prepping for my college-entrance exams, I would sometimes listen to classical music.<br />
<br />
I read online somewhere that it could calm one’s nerves and increase thinking capacity. Wanting every edge available to me, I made it a point to play these pieces when the opportunity arose. Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro, K. 492” was usually my go-to choice for its rising-and-falling notes.<br />
<br />
I don’t listen to a whole lot of classical music nowadays; metal has instead trounced everything else. But, as ClassicaLoid depicts, metal and many other motifs go together with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273620">
        classics more so than one may initially believe.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Kanae is a typical high-school girl who happens to be the caretaker of her family’s spacious mansion. A mansion that also houses the so-called ClassicaLoids, reincarnations of extremely famous composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, and so on. However, these now-modern geniuses bring both mischief and craziness through their quirks and their abilities, leaving Kanae, her childhood friend Sousuke, and everyone else to deal with one ClassicaLoid situation after another.<br />
<br />
As almost exclusively a comedy, ClassicaLoid attempts to tickle its audience’s funny bone not with a feathery quill but rather a conductor’s baton, filling the air with musical romps and lots of other noises. While it has its crescendos, the anime unfortunately has its diminuendos, too.<br />
<br />
One of the show’s biggest strengths comes through in its weirdness. For it can get very strange. A mother and her son fart in the other’s direction for some bonding time. A merleopon statue takes the form of a censored-out penis. Fried tangerines replace heads and give way to creepy flower monsters. At one point, everyone except Hasshie the bird and Pad-kun the device turns into a fish. Aliens terrorize the Earth until they hear the blissful tones of all Eight Sounds in unison.<br />
<br />
In other words, ClassicaLoid hits many different spots on the randomized map, going wherever it so desires to achieve laughter.<br />
<br />
This random nature doesn’t always seem to align with the anime’s goals, however. Liszt’s “girls’ day out” and Beethes worrying about creating the perfect cup of coffee using exactly sixty beans has very little to do with the classical, instrumental, and musical motifs that the anime so regularly follows. Indeed, their Musik applies to pretty much anything, meaning these elements aren’t so much a driving force for the comedy as they are an excuse for the anime to do whatever it wants without regard.<br />
<br />
That’s being too harsh, though. In fact, ClassicaLoid not strictly sticking with music-centric jokes and funnies is precisely the point of the premise. These ClassicaLoids are the modernized versions of their old-school counterparts. Watching them try to find the correct ingredient for jet-black gyoza or fail to do the simplest of chores makes for a silly contrast that helps with the anime’s comedic angle.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the anime does focus on the Musik, providing the audience with one new colorful performance nearly once every episode. Mozart’s “Symphony No. 25 in G Minor – K. 183.” Chopin’s “Nocturne No. 2.” Liszt’s “Liebesträume No. 3.” While they get reused occasionally, the show makes a clear effort to pack in as many of these famous pieces as it can muster.<br />
<br />
In doing so, more comedy comes forth through the very crux of these compositions. For example, in episode four, Schubert performs “Lullaby” whenever he gets particularly excited, infantilizing those around him. Then, in the very next episode, Beethes performs his “Piano Concerto 5 in E Minor.” It also goes by the title “Emperor Concerto” which, coincidentally enough, summons emperor penguins to do his bidding. And all the way down into episode nineteen, Tchaiko’s “Swan Lake” forces the residents of Kanae’s mansion to romantically pair up so that a bunch of “swans” can whisk them away.<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, ClassicaLoid has other, smaller jokes to fill the space between everything else. As Beethes plays his “Violin Sonata No. 9” (or “Kreutzer”), Pad-kun dons a Victorian-era wig to match the occasion. Or how, during Sousuke’s torturous “Boku Futsuu,” the eyes on Motes’ eel costume X themselves out as he “dies” from the aural pain. These smaller moments and details keep the comedy going even when the focus lies elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Beneath the comedy, a looming subplot exists, tying many of the episodes and their events together. It involves Bach, the “evil” ruler of a production company, and his plot for something grander. Unfortunately, it never really gains much focus, it doesn’t affect the characters to any worthwhile degree, and it ultimately doesn’t matter when his device breaks down (twice).<br />
<br />
ClassicaLoid also includes touchy-feely snippets. Kanae’s grandmother’s influence on her from the first episode brings a twinge of drama. And background scenes, like Kanae’s father saving Beethes and Motes from the facility that created them, offer minute explanations as to how this whole shebang came about. They slightly balance out the heavy amount of comedy and provide a better foundation for the plot, but these elements are either too infrequent or too unimportant to impact the anime, getting in the way of the comedy that ClassicaLoid creates.<br />
<br />
This combined weak subplot with weaker plot elements isn’t the best means for the show to get across its larger message, but at least it tries for something.<br />
<br />
Near the end of the season, Bach’s plan of normalizing music isn’t seen as beneficial but rather detrimental. Kanae describes such a musically averaged world as “lonely.” That “special music for special days” is only so because music isn’t everywhere. As her mini flashback depicts, the events her and the other characters went through are dear memories. Memories that, like music, are precious precisely because they represent one’s own experiences.<br />
<br />
Again, a nice sentiment. But, with the story steeped in ridiculousness, the anime makes it tough to walk away from this story with anything else besides Musik and comedy in mind.<br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION<br />
<br />
ClassicaLoid has a bit of an interesting style thanks to some specific artistic choices.<br />
<br />
A lot of the intrigue comes from the characters’ designs. They generally stick out from their surroundings due to thick outlines and loud outfits. Quirky colors and classical inspiration further their outspoken looks.<br />
<br />
For example, Beethes’ has his signature frazzled, white hair, but he wears a black leather jacket, contrasting his colors and highlighting his rocker gusto. Motes goes all pink with a big pillow-like hat and a tied sweater. In comparison, Schubert’s circular frames, mustard coat, and knee-high socks with brown pants hearken back to his era. Liszt’s orange eyes with embroidered-light-green dress, Bach’s disco attire with famous wig, and Chopin’s purple cape and long-silvered clothes continue ClassicaLoid’s nifty trend.<br />
<br />
Most notably, the Musik performances make a concerted effort to be as involved and as spontaneous and as weird as possible. Mozart will cause machines to literally dance in humanoid fashion. Bąda’s ritualistic sun both hypnotizes her fans and melts Tchaiko alive. Schubert spits fire, turning everyone into living graffiti which in turn pays homage to the classic PaRappa the Rapper video-game series.<br />
<br />
These segments go wherever they want to, introducing a lot of variety in the visuals. Moreover, they also increase the level of detail, highlighting the importance of the performances. Literal musical notes float through the air. Colors explode. Movement abounds. Entire settings morph. Altogether, these performances are some of the best moments in the show thanks to their involved, fantastical direction<br />
<br />
In general, though, ClassicaLoid doesn’t wow too much. The inside of Kanae’s mansion and the brief glimpses of the local city aren’t rife with pizzazz. Actual animation also remains barley passable whenever the characters are neither performing nor going overboard with their actions. Plus, it isn’t ashamed to reuse frames, like during Motes’s Musik performance at the end of episode twenty.<br />
<br />
Altogether, it’s a toss-up like that of the story. That is, the anime focuses a lot on a couple of specific areas, but many of the surrounding parts do not hold the same level of strength, ultimately reducing its final sense of worth.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
ClassicaLoid’s comedy only comes about because of the crazy cast of characters that wave their batons throughout the season. As legends of the classical era reincarnated, one would probably expect Beethoven and Mozart and the others to carry an air of power and formality. Instead, they stir up all manner of trouble through their large penchant for wackiness.<br />
<br />
Beethes cannot get enough of gyoza, a Chinese-inspired Japanese dish that wraps delectable foodstuffs in a doughy, grilled wrapper. More specifically, he can’t get enough of perfecting his gyoza, for Beethes strives for nothing less than mastery of the arts. Thus, he’s overzealous in almost anything he does (with a flamethrower often somewhere nearby). So long as his passions aren’t suppressed and his fate is his to control, he’s a very happy, very loud, and very musical man.<br />
<br />
Motes cares less about music and more about having a grand old time. He constantly pulls pranks, makes jokes, and creates extra, unnecessary problems for everyone else at the mansion. While he continues to not follow the rules by rolling around through the hallways on his roller-shoes, he still has a kind heart in that none of his actions are designed with malice in mind. Him becoming the local “unidentified monster” to mother a weak fawn demonstrates handily enough that this prankster isn’t so bad after all.<br />
<br />
Liszt thinks neither about gyoza nor pranks. Instead, she adamantly promotes a single facet of life: love. Thinking about her “little kitten” and watching out for her box-wearing friend, Liszt adores the expression of love in all its sincere, nonsensical forms. As a man-turned-bodacious-babe, she’s arguably the most normal, most mature of the group – but that’s not saying a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Chopin goes in the complete opposite direction; he cannot tolerate people. A recluse in all but name, he locks himself away in his room, shopping online for new items and playing video games to earn that next piece of rare loot. When he does leave his “cave,” he either hides beneath a box or keeps himself way off in the distance. Alongside his occasional blunt remarks, his generally pessimistic vibe keeps the outgoing personalities around him from overtaking the show outright.<br />
<br />
Schubert arrives a bit later than the others, but his oddball behavior fits right in. He idolizes Beethes, chasing after and defending the famous musician as much as humanly possible. In contrast, he hates Motes to the core and refuses to accept him as a friend. Schubert also accidentally loses control of his Musik whenever he gets too excited which, in turn, leaves him without much respect among his peers. That is, if they even remember that he is there to begin with.<br />
<br />
Outside of the main legends, Bach, Tchaiko, and Bąda watch from afar. Bach tends to converse in only musical jargon. Tchaiko flits about in fits of rage. Bąda is the only actual female composer – and, as she is often reminded, the only one-hit wonder of the group. They are the bad-guys-but-not-really of the show, and, while they’re not as prevalent as Beethes and the others, they add their own personality and their own fun into the mix.<br />
<br />
Despite their origins, none of the characters achieve comedic genius. Plus, their characteristics seem a far cry from their historic selves. Yet the anime incorporates the backgrounds of these real-life composers, often taking some creative liberties to make everything a bit more interesting.<br />
<br />
For instance, in one episode, Chopin falls for an online avatar named Jolly, connecting back to the light of his life during his original years. Tchaiko’s whole character also counts. Her real name is Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky, an old Russian composer. Now an underage girl, the anime plays up her angry attitude, her devotion to Bach, and the fact that she cannot drink alcohol.<br />
<br />
Certain characters, like Beethes and Motes, do get some more serious exploration of their characters peppered in throughout ClassicaLoid. Beethes contemplates the time when he was deaf, pushing him to achieve greatness. And Motes reels in the pranks and the goofiness to showcase that he can get serious and introspective when he so chooses.<br />
<br />
Of particular note, Schubert goes through what can only be described as tangible character development. Late into the season, he becomes fed up with how everyone either forgets or does not seem to care about him. In retaliation, he changes his whole persona, ditching the soft, classical approach and adopting instead a set of sick rapping beats.<br />
<br />
These moments aren’t too impactful, rarely pop up, and honestly don’t matter much when almost everything else seeps with comedy. Liszt not even receiving a specialized episode for herself when almost everyone else gets one argues for this statement well enough. Nevertheless, these slight departures keep the variety going while trying for something new that the anime never had to.<br />
<br />
The remaining important characters are not ClassicaLoids but humans: Kanae, Sousuke, Mitsuru, and Kyougo.<br />
<br />
Kanae is the technical main protagonist of this tale, but, understandably, the composers overshadow her presence. She oversees the mansion, “collects” rent, and yells at her tenants to go away on more than one occasion. Strict and unforgiving, she berates the others for their continual stress-inducing lifestyles. While she has a couple of asides about her deceased grandmother, and she rags on her dad for his irresponsible behavior, her main role is mostly to provide some semblance of sanity within this wild group of Musik-making crazies.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Sousuke is the non-ClassicaLoid music guy in the party. Unfortunately, he isn’t the best musician, and he usually finds himself with the short end of the stick. He’s Kanae’s childhood friend, he hangs out at the mansion because why not, and he’s more or less a pretty all right dude. He nearly kills everyone with his horrendous, self-made composition, but he at least got a few fans (even if they seemed to be laughing at, not with, him). Plus, he (alongside Kanae) helps to save the world from the alien invasion. So, even though Sousuke isn’t the most noteworthy character in the show, he manages to make a name for himself nonetheless.<br />
<br />
As for Mitsuru and Kyougo, they were the scientists who created the ClassicaLoids, sparking this whole story to begin with. Mitsuru views Bach as a deity, erroneously going out of her way to bring his plans to fruition. Kyougo is Kanae’s dad and means well, but he only does what he wants to do, traveling everywhere and appearing at the most convenient of times. Sadly, she’s a rather boring “villain,” and he’s hardly around enough to remain relevant to both the comedy and the story at large.<br />
<br />
That’s a lot of comedy-based characters in a show. If they were completely on their own, it wouldn’t quite work because their schticks can only be carried so far. In this big group, though, the anime can pick and choose among a variety of simultaneous craziness, leading to inevitable funnies that keep the spirit and the Musik of the show alive.<br />
<br />
MUSIC &amp; SOUND<br />
<br />
ClassicaLoid’s opening track does not get replaced despite such an occurrence being so common for anime spanning multiple seasons. A wise decision on the show’s part, for this OP stands as one of its strongest features. The guitarist rocks out, fretting with finesse and creating one slick lick after another. Loud, rousing notes stomp down in dominance. Classical inspiration can clearly be heard in its harpsichord and its violins, and the lack of lyrics calls back to that time when only the instrumentals truly mattered. It’s catchy. It’s dynamic. It’s fun. An all-around superb piece.<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, ClassicaLoid goes above and beyond with its choice musical pieces. Known as “Musik,” the anime modernizes classical compositions that befit the characters and their zany situations. Techno, rock ‘n’ roll, avant-garde. At about one new modernization per episode, the anime contains too many to list out in full. Suffice it to say, they maintain a huge amount of diversity while staying true to their originals, justifying the anime’s formal name for this collection of creations.<br />
<br />
In fact, the anime is so confident in its Musik that it reuses them for each of its ending tracks. That’s not a fault against the anime but rather a positive. Getting to hear these songs once again with the conclusion of every episode makes for a tiny treat that satiates the ear’s palate.<br />
<br />
Once again, like the story and the art, the anime has put its eggs all in one basket. Because, ironically enough, the rest of the original soundtrack, what comprises most of the music heard throughout the season, fails to live up to its lauded brethren.<br />
<br />
Lackluster and almost forgettable, it feels as if the Musik (understandably) stole all the attention to the point that these tracks miss out on any appeal. They don’t feel like preludes to the Musik so much as they seem like one-off opening acts at a concert where people only showed up to listen to the main, magical gigs that arrive on stage afterwards.<br />
<br />
And, while the voice acting performances do not reach incredible status, many of them bring what they can to the piano bench. Specifically, Tomokazu Sugita as Beethes pursues life with a determined, manly voice, Mikako Komatsu as Kanae berates her guests with chiding tones, and Aya Endou as Tchaiko squabbles with rage.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
After finishing this show, it made me think about something that I don’t always keep in mind.<br />
<br />
When it comes to anime, films, and books, stories exist out there that unfortunately get lost along the way. That’s almost impossible to avoid in these mediums given how there are so many to choose. Of course, some will be semi-popular, some will stick out in the minds of critics and fans alike, and some will earn an infamous reputation that keeps future viewers away.<br />
<br />
The majority of these stories, though, fall somewhere in the middle. They don’t do anything particularly egregious, but they don’t do anything particularly noteworthy either. Maybe they have an aspect or two that seems interesting, or maybe the project has a clear vision. Regardless, the show doesn’t hook its audience, and it slowly drifts off from the minds of those in its respective community.<br />
<br />
That’s what I feel happened here with this one. The anime no doubt has passion behind it: all the variations in the music, a wacky premise, twenty-five whole episodes with an entire second season to follow. Yet, be it because of the niche classical motif or the reliance on too random of comedy, however, the anime sadly misses the cut.<br />
<br />
To clarify, I’m not saying that the anime couldn’t improve in certain areas. It is often repetitive with its jokes and its setups. It tries to be extra loud rather than extra intriguing. It does not create more defined relationships between the cast members. But, if it tweaked the execution here and tried for something different there, I could see this one being more prominent in the eyes of the community rather than barely talked about in almost any capacity.<br />
<br />
As for myself, while I cannot say the anime entertained me throughout the whole season, I did have fun on occasion. Kanae’s “the pain…” karaoke song in episode eight probably went on for a tad too long, but it still had me smiling. The second half of episode eleven, with Beethes “confession” and the pink “puke,” had me laughing quite a bit. And Schubert’s diss track was, as the kids say, “fire.”<br />
<br />
All in all, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that I’m sad to see these characters go. However, after being with them for a big chunk of time, and realizing that this writing of mine may very well be the last instance where I ever think about this show (save for my top-anime-from-Winter-2017 list in the coming weeks), I’m left feeling slightly saddened. Saddened by the fact that some anime simply do not stay around for long – and then it’s on to the next story.<br />
<br />
ClassicaLoid does not earn a standing ovation, but it gives an above average performance nonetheless. Lots of ridiculous comedy, creative visual scenes, weird characters, and diverse Musik. It rises and falls throughout, ending up somewhere in-between (on multiple figarotive levels).<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, random, crazy comedy pushes everything along, the classical premise is used and contrasted to an appreciable degree, and the uncommon dramatic subplots mean very little in the long run<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Good, nifty character designs and interesting Musik spectacles stave off the generally lackluster artistry and actual movement<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Beethes, Motes, and the other reincarnated musical geniuses are goofy and fun, Kanae and Sousuke round out this circus troupe, but everyone requires the whole group to be effective<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Sound: Good, an awesome OP and a large set of creative “Musik” covers outperform a forgettable OST and the handful of notable VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fine, while yet another show that will fade from the memories of most in this ever-growing medium, enough fun moments can be found to make the experience worthwhile in one way or another<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10

    classicaloid is so UNDERRATED. I WILL TELL YOU!<br />
the accuracy of this anime is impeccable and i love it so much. im so happy to see a series depicting these historic musicians as the psychotic bastards they were. <br />
classicaloid is lacking a bit in story but I think it makes up in comedy, BUT I also think you have to be a specific sort of person to enjoy classicaloids humor. I will now go in depth <br />
<br />
STORY- 6<br />
<br />
The story for this season lacks any meaningful development for a VERY long time. This is because there&#039;s no real villainy/obstacle, sure you have the evil mega corp Bach

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375706">
        and his underlings but throughout the season he&#039;s more neutral than anything. If you asked me I couldn&#039;t name a single REAL threatening thing he did the entire time. With the concept this anime has you would think they would do more with it, but they do not. I mean you have clones of these figures and they don&#039;t do anything but make fart jokes and never pay their rent. To be fair, the story gets miles better in season 2 but thats not relevant right now. The story in this season just consists of the classicaloids messing around and getting into trouble because their bumbling idiots, while land lord Kanae has constant mental breakdowns after asking her tenants to be productive members of society for the 8th episode.<br />
I&#039;m just going to be a little spoilery so don&#039;t read if you havent finished but,,<br />
I think Beethoven and Mozart shutting down Bach in trying to let EVERYONE have musik was pretty awful. Like why can&#039;t people have musik? If everyone has musik then everyone can share their experiences with the people around them. Like the thing is Mozart and Beethoven didn&#039;t shut it down because &quot;Oh, it might be used for evil.&quot; They shut it down because &quot;NO! Music is special!!&quot; Like.. WTF does that even mean?? Yes Music is special so why not share it with others?? It just didn&#039;t make sense at all and was very selfish of Mozart and Beethoven to do. <br />
<br />
ART- 9<br />
GOOD ART!! The main characters have thick lines that no one else does, their designs greatly contrast those around them, overall the art has miles of personality in it. When they use their musik it does feeling like your eyes are bleeding(depending on who uses it) but the actual musik designs are very great!! I love their transformations and I love how they show the exaggeration of the characters personalities through what their wearing. For example the way they show Liszts femininity and over exaggerate Beethovens passion through his leather jacket, and show Chopins degeneracy through his tracksuit. OR hell its not even an exaggeration sometimes, like they made Bach wear a disco oriented getup when he&#039;s written maybe like one or two jazzy pieces. The arts just great overall it really suits the characters personalities and makes you question your own state of mind, I love it.<br />
<br />
SOUND-9<br />
AMAZING!!!!!! Okay actually half the tracks are a miss but the other half are genius. The music is usually made by this rock band thats not very good so most of the miss tracks come from them. but they are not all bad. As a show about music most of the music are remixes of classical songs, and wow.. I haven&#039;t heard such good remixes like how they took the Turkish March and mixed it with Thriller that was brilliant. They absolutely nailed Chopins remixes by using vocaloid, really shows how much of a loser he is!! Whoever did Tchaikos remixes also did them well they are bangers. The Intro theme is really good too, I like how they actually didn&#039;t use vocals, (Thank god.) and instead used mostly classicaloid instruemnts. It nods to the period the animes actually based on and lets you focus more on the animation in the beginning. Now the missed themes come from Mozart, Beethoven, and Liszt. The voice actors/singers were doing their best but honestly if they had just not done singing their themes would have been just fine. Like wow, I would&#039;ve given this a 20 if all of Liszts themes DIDNT HAVE SINGING. WHY DID THEY ADD SINGING?? HIS PIANO PIECES DO NOT EVEN INCLUDE SINGING!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS-9<br />
There is a lack in development and drive to the lives these characters live. And lack of flashbacks for certain characters such as Chopin, Liszt, and others. And I&#039;m talking about like, little or NO development. All other cast has their moments but even those are short lived, and often times they make their moments more dramatic then needed to be. But that I feel is overshadowed by their gimmicks and eccentric personalities. I just love things that are ridiculous and their characters are so ridiculous enough that the lack of flashbacks Isn&#039;t a deal breaker for me. I enjoy the clones of these figures making a name for themselves, because after all these ARENT the real composers their just clones.<br />
I wish they expanded more on that, it would&#039;ve been nice if the characters thought more about what it meant just being clones.<br />
But anyway wow the characters, absolute maniacs. It really shows how undignified most composers were in their personal lives and this show makes them human by showing us that. Of course Schubert and a couple other characters aren&#039;t exactly accurate, but Liszt, Chopin, Mozart, and Beethoven are wildly similar to their real life counterparts. Mozart will always be insane.<br />
But anyway, Bach had a good character and I think he was a good Neutral Villian. I think this show needed a stronger Villian character, but Bach in general had a nice motivation for doing what he wanted to do. Tchaiko and Bada being paired together against their will I think was very funny, and good for contrast of character. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT-10<br />
<br />
This is gonna be my favorite anime for a while just because of how entertaining it is. Like the gags do get repetitive sometimes but when you finish the anime it really becomes nostalgic. This isn&#039;t the anime to watch if your looking for meaningful story, but it is the anime to watch if your looking for laughs and the memory to look back on it and be like.. Yeah, that was pretty ridiculous. I&#039;ve rewatched it like twice.<br />
<br />
Overall I give it a 10 just because I think this anime deserves a better score. My real rating would be an 8. But anyway, this really does pander to a small group of people. If you think of composers to be dignified people who were very formal your not going to like this anime. If you wanted MALE anime Liszt, you are NOT going to like this anime but I suggest you stick around for season 2 to see him for 2 minutes. Just lower your expectations before watching.. Please.<br />
This isn&#039;t a really general public anime, but you can still enjoy it without know thing references!! It&#039;s funny either way.
