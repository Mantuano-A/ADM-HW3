Because seriously, how much longer is this franchise going to suffer? Hasn’t it been humiliated enough? At this point it almost seems like it has been victim of a curse, since after the failure of Heaven’s Overture movie in 2004 the franchise never knew again of a new installment that had been both successful and satisfying. Acts #2 and #3 of the Hades arc were mediocre with a bullshit conclusion coming right after a fantastic and spectacular act #1, and then the show was followed by a series of bad spin-offs which mostly only contributed to sink the reputation of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302903">
        the original. Omega with its excessively kiddy approach didn’t do it any favor, Legend of Sanctuary movie was almost like a terrible CGI version of Seiya’s equivalent to Dragon Ball Evolution, Soul of Gold was just a bad excuse to sell more shiny and expensive action figures, and the single time they hit something right with the competent Lost Canvas, the japs just didn’t give a fuck and the prequel series was canceled probably forever. Now, Saintia Shou is the latest attempt to put the franchise back on track but unfortunately, it has turned out to be the complete opposite; it gives yet another stab wound to an already badly injured franchise and has made it hit a new low. (Ironically, I’m convinced the only way to “save it” or really redeem it is precisely making what always has had to be done; the Heaven’s Arc, precisely the continuation of the movie that started the bad-luck streak!). <br />
<br />
First of all I can’t say I’m disappointed since after so many mediocre offerings, I never had many expectations with this one and I just watched it because well, it’s another addition to the universe that bears the name of one of my all time favorite shows and I just watched it out of curiosity. It’s not like I was genuinely excited from the beginning. So instead of disappointment, what I’m really feeling after completing this is only deep lamentation and regret for the bad luck its name and reputation have had to bear… once again. I really can’t believe what I saw. This is by far the worst adaptation of Seiya I’ve seen, and judging by the awful overall score it currently has in the site, I think I’m not alone here. When I thought nothing could be more awful and insulting to the legacy and reputation of the original series after Omega and Soul of Gold, well, I was wrong, it could! So much that I don’t even know where to start from to explain, nor how.<br />
<br />
Simply put, the story is plain bad and the execution even worse. The latter is just so mind-bogglingly horrible that it almost feels like the staff wanted to troll the fan on purpose. It almost feels like an utter joke. The low budget assigned is no excuse. Many shows have been made with low budgets and their staffs have come up with creative ways to overcome that constraint in order to anyway make them at least acceptable, but this wasn’t the case. You just can almost tell like the staff just never really cared about this show and put very little effort. Heck, even with early Dragon Ball Super you could tell they were giving something more than a damn!<br />
<br />
**Some spoilers of the original series**.<br />
<br />
The story expands the original Seiya’s universe by introducing a new class of female saints known as “saintias”-who are not the same as the traditional female saints presented in the original work by Kurumada- in an attempt to create the female version of Saint Seiya featuring 5 female warriors protecting the Earth and the goddess they swear allegiance to from the threat of other gods because wouldn’t it be sooo cool to make female versions of action shounens with female heroines instead. Saintias are not saints strictly speaking; they are just maids/bodyguards serving and protecting Athena and are not forced to use masks unlike traditional female saints, which seems to be really the only difference, since “normal” female saints well, also train, serve and protect the goddess. So, why having a different, new class now? The reason is one and only one: because it obviously would have looked so weird to have a cast of main heroines all wearing a mask all the time without ever seeing her real faces! Obviously, from a commercial perspective it wouldn’t have worked at all. It’s understandable, so it can’t be an issue really. <br />
<br />
But what is an issue and what comes as inevitably annoying is how bad the story tries to fit with the events of the original, since it chose to chronologically take place within them. We are on this occasion asked to happily believe that at the same time Athena was carrying out her Galaxian Tournament (who now we are told had assumed her role before this event, not after it), she was confronting the threat of goddess Eris and that this totally didn’t interfere with the celebration of the former since it couldn’t be the case since in the original obviously this never existed and we don’t wanna establish inconsistencies, right? It now inevitably feels weird that in the original Athena had never ever mentioned anything about Eris and neither the golden saints and the Pope that were similarly aware of her existence and threat and also how the bronze saints seemed to be totally unaware of both the conflict and the saintias themselves who were also protecting Saori considering how close they were to her. It just makes things harder to believe, since the original now makes it look like all this had been something going on in secrecy when it didn’t have to be the case. It’s hard to believe now that the Pope was also concerned about Eris when in the original it looked like he was dedicating his whole time to the recovery of the Sagittarius golden cloth and her conflict with Saori from the distance. It also looks, while feasible, so convenient that Eris had been seemingly defeated right before the start of Sanctuary’s assault under the orders of the Pope only to show up again and make her comeback right after the conclusion of the same Sanctuary conflict because -obviously- it couldn’t be another way if we didn’t want to introduce more questionable circumstances.<br />
<br />
Athena vs Eris round was yet another Athena’s classic damsel in distress countdown, this time lying in between the Sanctuary and Poseidon clashes. What looked so funny is that now Athena had to face another one of these death curses, in a matter of just hours right after she had miraculously survived the previous one! It looked so silly, please, somebody give this lady some time to breathe! I know this was also the case in the Asgard to Poseidon transitions, but at least in those arcs there was more creativity regarding the type of threat Athena was facing (in Asgard she’s not really running a risk of dying, she was only slowly losing her energies) and it wasn’t THAT immediate! It comes as surprising that after 3 decades and several installments, the amount of creativity here is this low, and that they had opted for this way when the original already presented creative ways to showcase the same plot-structure. Additionally, some other elements of the conflict looked quite laughable. A floating temple under a giant tree about to collide with Athena’s Sanctuary? Memories and regrets of the dead become “alive” under the awakening of Eris thanks to how much blood was spilled in the 12 Houses’ fights? Really? Not to mention that Eris herself is a terrible, lousy enemy to begin with. While her motivations are interesting enough to consider her a decent villain, it can’t be helped that she literally looks like an evil Disney fairy-tale movie witch that doesn’t inspire a single pinch of true intimidation and authority unlike other goddesses like Artemisa or other previous female enemies like Hilda and Pandora which were portrayed in a much more respectful and serious way. Laughing maniacally with this “I am so evil and I seek destruction, muahahaha!” voice and face totally goes against the more serious nature of all the enemies of the franchise. The voice actress behind seems like she thought she was playing the evil witch role. It’s sad to see how Shou sells itself as something to take seriously, but at the same time takes these tactical decisions that are more suitable for a kids’ morning cartoon. I don’t see here the same adult tone of the original which is what I and most of the fans think when thinking about Saint Seiya.<br />
<br />
It didn’t help the fact that it also unnecessarily depicted in different ways some events in the original just because it wanted to be more faithful to the source. For example, now it turns out that Saori and Saga had already met before the conclusion of the Sanctuary arc like it was the case in the original, partially ruining the great sense of tension and suspense this decision established by making the two parts not knowing each other until the very end and fighting in blind since the start. It also turns out now that instead of the bronze and gold saints beautifully meeting, taking a bow and walking with Athena all the way up to the Pope’s house and lastly everyone involved confronting Saga in Athena’s temple, Athena this time just walks alone, meets Saga in the middle of the road, there’s no Gemini cloth abandoning and testing Saga’s will, no one-last-time Saga’s evil side trying to win while explaining what drove his actions to everybody followed by Athena’s inspiring, compassionate answer, and no Gemini cloth’s helmet crying! And the final suicide moment comes as totally uninspiring as opposed to the gripping one we saw in the original. This show doesn’t make justice to that fascinating final encounter. While Shou’s version of the events is the real manga version, honestly, I feel the first anime version pulled it off way better and improved upon the source by caring to make the moment more thrilling and memorable, actually managing to make a powerful impact. Also… no Seiya being hit by Saga while he was aiming the shield to where Athena was lying at the last minute! Like, come on! If something already worked great, what’s the need to make it work not so great!?<br />
<br />
Oh, and finally…now it also turns that Milo and Aphrodite always knew about the truth regarding Saori…and still stopped and delayed the bronze saints in their way up! Making honestly no sense. I can’t help but feeling this new story would have been a better idea had it not developed in the same universe as the original but rather in another new one. That way none of the aforementioned issues would have ever been a thing.   <br />
<br />
Moving on to the execution, the series is just too god-damn short for its own good. One of the most notorious and main problems in the series is that they decided to make something that should’ve lasted at least 25 episodes in… 10. There’s just so much relevant stuff going on in such a small amount of episodes that at the end it feels like you’re watching in 3x unintentionally. The rushed feeling of storytelling is so damn high that at the end the whole series feels like it was just a very long recap of something bigger, and as a result, hardly the viewer can give a damn about anything that’s going on because it utterly fails to immerse him in the story at all (especially regarding Athena vs Eris supposedly grandiose clash between the saintias and the dryads and ghosts armies that lasted the grand total of… 3.5, yes, 3.5 episodes. How could they really expect to build and develop an exciting and memorable clash in just 3.5 episodes? It’s virtually impossible to do so, and in the end, the conflict is rendered as something only anecdotal, like a forgettable, short non-canon extra movie). <br />
<br />
Everything from beginning to end feels like a quick fulfillment of a checklist. Have you ever seen one of those short franchise-specials that quickly summarize an entire arc or storyline of the parent series? Saintia Shou feels virtually like the exact same thing…except that this is a normal series, not a special! It totally lacks a sense of natural progression. You can really tell like if there were some missing scenes that naturally connect all the events of the story and that ultimately are the ones that actually can make the viewer care about what he’s watching. The amount of time to develop the story was so little that as a result there was no space to properly build the tension, the digestion after the release and the viewer&#039;s immersion into the world that would have made this at least minimally interesting and entertaining. Fights and conflicts also, given this, do not feel thrilling nor impactful enough (even the ones involving the popular and beloved golden saints) something the original series knew how to pull off so well. Every single event here, be it in the introduction, development or conclusion, like just…come and go! Without trying to leave a proper impact, a proper trace, and do not carry a single bit of emotional weight at all. To such an extent that even Soul of Gold looks like a masterpiece regarding this in comparison!<br />
<br />
But obviously, there was no budget for 25 episodes, so they had to do the best they could, but honestly, if the result was going to be this bad, it would have been better not to adapt anything in the first place.<br />
<br />
In addition, in Shou everything, how can I tell this?…feels so incredibly and annoyingly.. fake! In Shou everything is depicted like if it was a fucking children’s school-break game. Nothing feels remotely real. There’s no sense of realism. No sense of seriousness. Everything feels so IN YOUR FACE. No sense of watching something that at least TRIES to feel real. Many characters here behave and talk like they were actors not giving a damn about the fictional work they were realizing because they were being underpaid or not paid at all! Or because they didn’t feel it was “relevant” enough…like one of those high school festival plays nobody involved takes seriously enough. It feels that amateurish. It’s embarrassing and painful to watch, to say the least.<br />
<br />
The series, again, due to the extreme rush and compression of events, also fails to make us care about and relate with all the set of new characters, including the protagonist Shouko, who essentially is the female version of the determined, kind-hearted and impulsive Seiya by mirroring -and paying homage- to his themes (separated from her sister at a young age, a mythological-horse as a guardian constellation, the same iconic technique, among others). With the exception of Shouko, virtually all of them felt like empty shells. All the rest of saintias that were not Shouko, how can I put it? were just…there. None of them is introduced properly, and given the short run there was no time to do anything remotely engaging with them, which is what was seen. Not even their cloths look distinctive enough from each other. I’ve read that the series omitted a lot of relevant content present in the source in this regard. The only one that matters here is Shouko and all the rest are almost shown like they were just the backup singers, as opposed to the original which brilliantly knew how to make relevant all of the 5 main members, even from the start. Here, we don’t get to care neither get along nor feel anything for them. Consequently, why should I care what happens to them if the show does nothing to make me care for them to begin with? Here, the all-time fan (who is honestly the only one that was going to watch this show) will only care for the characters he already knew from before, this is; the golden saints and Saori. <br />
<br />
There were also some elements that felt so out of place for a “Seiyaverse-based” installment that made me feel I was simply watching another franchise. A saintia riding a frickin’ motorbike like she was taken out from a cyberpunk movie? A vampire loli enemy that looks like taken out from a dumb fantasy show? A Chinese girl acting like she was taken out from a Rumiko Takahashi comedy? And a fight against a fuckin’ giant TEDDY BEAR, among others? None of this feels appropriate in the very serious mythologically-based universe of Seiya, more so if the installment takes place in the same original timeline. In fact, it is quite annoying. A saint driving a motorbike doesn’t look “mythologically” romantic, it looks instead quite… mundane. <br />
<br />
And I haven’t even mentioned anything about the god-awful animation yet! While the show is in most of the episodes beautifully drawn, using again the beautiful art style by Shingo Araki in (most of) the character designs, the same can’t be said about the animation. How can we feel true excitement from battles when movements are limited to showing a character’s body just stiffly shaking in a corner of the screen in front of a sea of fast-moving parallel lines and that’s it? With no sense of realism at all and looking incredibly boring to watch? We don’t even see any type of minimal scratch or body damage after any character has been hit by an attack! This is quite curious considering this was not even shown on TV!<br />
<br />
Music didn’t help either. How can I describe it? Most of the BGM here feels like taken from a kiddy Marvel comics&#039; videogame. Really. Completely failing to set the proper serious and fascinating moods like it was the case with the original. I just couldn’t believe it when I knew that the same guy that gave us the amazing, captivating and full of personality score of Hunter x Hunter (1999) could make in this occasion a score this uninspiring, generic and forgettable. The opening wasn’t bad, but didn’t feel fitting either, since it looked like an opening from something like frickin’ Madoka Magica.<br />
<br />
Despite all of the above, I have to recognize the show still presents some points that I liked and that were nice additions to not render it as a completely worthless experience from an all-time fan perspective. It was good to see for example how it is mentioned here the realistic outcome that not every boy sent to train to foreign locations to become a bronze saint got to achieve it and came back with the cloth, and that some of them developed an understandable disdain towards Saori after years of mistreatment in the foundation, as brought to light in the figure of Toki. It was good to see how Saori feels guilty about this and overall how the series explores much more in-depth how does she actually feel in regards to her role as a goddess and protector of the Earth, its meaning and implications, her anxieties, and how her actions in the past have impacted the world she’s supposed to defend, making her a better-developed character, something we never really got to see in the original. I also liked the explicit inclusion of the conversation among Shion, Saga and Aioros regarding the future of the Sanctuary and the new Pope. And that the golden saint that got the most screentime and participation this time had been Milo; he has always been to my eyes one of the coolest golden saints of all and it was very welcome to see him enjoying most of the spotlight. Nonetheless, obviously, all of this just isn’t enough to compensate for an overall terribly executed story and show. <br />
<br />
Rushed, horribly directed, horribly animated, uninspiring, unexciting, unpassionate, unmemorable, devoid of any soul and made by a staff that looked like they just didn’t care, Saintia Sho only served to sink even more the reputation of the franchise after the streak of entries ranging from mediocre-to-terrible like the conclusion of the Hades arc in original, Omega, Legend of Sanctuary and Soul of Gold. Watching adaptations like Shou honestly made me want to go back to the times when I wasn’t caring about anime anymore (which was a long time span), so that I didn’t have to be curious to watch entries like this one, spoiling my good memories in the process and missing the old staff of the original series who actually put love and care in their work. 2/10.

    If you&#039;re a Saint Seiya fan I recommend watching this. Saintia Sho revolves around female saints known as Saintias. What&#039;s the difference between these female saints and the female saints that wear masks? well these Saintias are Athena&#039;s personal body guards who work in the shadows. It perfectly fits with the timeline of the original series. Its gives you a new story revolving the Saintias while giving you iconic and nostalgic scenes from the original series. Believe me, keep watching and you&#039;ll enjoy it. <br />

This is my first review because the creator of the manga needs help. The manga did not sell as much as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300826">
        she intended it to do and therefore the animators are working with very little and under extreme conditions to bring us new episodes. Even though this is the case they&#039;re doing an awesome job. Many people do not know this and are complaining about how fast paced each episode is. I am trying to do my part and write a review in order to increase its popularity because I truly enjoy this series. Anyway&#039;s, be sure to give it a shot.

    Saint Seiya fans who understands what that series was trying to teach/show us will understand this new adaptation!  And no, it&#039;s not a complete remake with girl Saints and a girl replacing Pegasus Seiya...  This is not an anime like Sailor Moon either.  This one is much better and full of emotions.  You can&#039;t help but root for the main characters and hope for the best...  The story is actually happening during the original series of Saint Seiya that aired in the 80s.  There may be some slight plot holes here and there, but overall, it ties in perfectly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301776">
        with the original series.  I must admit I was skeptical even before watching this new anime, but I am so glad that I started watching it because I would have missed out on an amazing story full of emotions...<br />
<br />
The art does not follow the same style as the manga but that was on purpose.  This anime tried to keep the same style as the original Saint Seiya series with a modern twist to it.  I find that is perfectly fine as they have sequences where the animators drew masterpieces.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of this anime is also topnotch!  I give that a solid &quot;Godlike&quot; 10. ;D  Many tracks takes cue from the original serie&#039;s soundtrack and add its own twist to it.  There are many new tracks in this anime that has the Saint Seiya uplifting theme and those are also amazing songs!!!  Some tracks are of course, very sad/tragic... but nevertheless, amazingly done tracks!<br />
<br />
I guarantee you are missing out in a real gem if you have not watched it yet.  It&#039;s only 12 episodes and I wish there was more and pray this does not mean what I think it means... ;O

    I can not understand how a 2013 manga can be so &quot;old&quot; and its adaptation so overdone, taking the fact that Saint Seiya is a more nostalgic work, the 1986 anime model should not have been used in a 2019 anime. I&#039;m in favor of changes, so many traits as the animation was very low level even being something done by Toei, I honestly was very disappointed, besides that the story is too convenient, a character who did not even know the existence of the universe of knights to be able to use the armor so well and be so strong? An enviable protagonism even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304635">
        for Seiya.<br />
<br />
(Pt-BR) Eu não consigo entender como um mangá de 2013 consegue ser tão &quot;antigo&quot; e sua adaptação tão ultrapassada, tirando o fato de Saint Seiya ser uma obra mais nostálgica, o modelo do anime de 1986 não deveria ter sido usado em um anime de 2019. Eu sou a favor de mudanças, tantos os traços quanto a animação era de baixíssimo nível mesmo sendo algo feito pela Toei, eu sinceramente fiquei bastante decepcionado, além de que a história é conveniente demais, um personagem que nem sabia da existência do universo dos cavaleiros conseguir usar tão bem a armadura e ser tão forte? Um protagonismo invejável até para o Seiya.

The new Spin-Off of Saint Seiya, Saintia Sho, this series had all the potential in front of him, his manga is undoubtedly a work of art, his style of drawing, his history, etc. But it seems that Toei little or nothing cares and although its original style is strange, the classic style is something that is appreciated and that is strange in Omega and Soul Of Gold, this anime sin of being very hasty, badly animated (although I know it&#039;s not Gonzo&#039;s fault), skipping several parts of the manga and inventing an ending to the FMA 2003. Although at the moment it is not known

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302435">
        for sure if it&#039;s finished or will continue, Toei returned to a series with a lot of potential in something mediocre.<br />

El nuevo spin-off de Saint Seiya, Saintia Sho, esta serie tenía todo el potencial delante suyo, su manga es sin duda una obra de arte, su estilo de dibujo, su historia, etc. Pero parece que a Toei poco o nada le importo y si bien se extraña su estilo original, el estilo clasico es algo que se agradece y que se extraño en Omega y Soul Of Gold, este anime peca de ser muy apresurado, mal animado (aunque se que no es culpa de Gonzo), saltandose varias partes del manga e inventandose un final a lo FMA 2003. Aunque por el momento no se sabe a ciencia cierta si ya termino o va a continuar, Toei volvia a una serie con mucho potencial en algo mediocre.

    First, Saintia Sho is a good series, very accurate and absolutely recommended for fans of the classic series. However, this applies to the MANGA, not to this anime adaptation, horrible, skimpy and twisted by Toei.<br />
<br />
The anime of Sho is not the manga of Chimaki Kuori, it takes the bases and some characters, but diverges in many aspects, and also tries to give a conclusion to the war, when the story in the manga goes on for much longer.<br />
<br />
All this to say that, whether you liked this anime or not (in my opinion worse than Omega), do not exclude the manga of Sho, because it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308098">
        a different thing, a meticulously edited work, which I recommend to classic fans of the series.<br />
<br />
Now I start. There could be spoilers.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: 4<br />
<br />
First of all, to make you understand, in 10 episodes Toei &quot;has adapted&quot; (so to speak) about 8 volumes of the manga. From this you can imagine the cuts, as well as the changes, a disaster.<br />
<br />
The story is broadly the same, but in fact there were several differences or omissions with respect to the manga. Where to start ...<br />
<br />
The first volume was cut in different parts, the confrontation with Phonos changed (in the manga Milo confronted him), the first meeting between Eris (like Kyoko) and Athena was cut, as many parts were omitted in the Galaxian Wars phase , including the clash between Erda and Deathmask (important for both characters). 12 slightly different houses, Eris striking Atena with the golden apple, invented, omitted the appearances of several new dryads, and greatly altered the clashes with Rigel, Eris and &quot;EvilSaga&quot;, won by the saints to give an ending in the anime , while in the manga they have not won one, and the story continues.<br />
<br />
Do we want to mention the most absurd moments, totally filler, invented by Toei, not present in the manga?<br />
<br />
The resurrection of the 3 silver saints, defeated in zero seconds by the 3 girls? (badly copied from the Hades Sanctuary) Shoko who sees the memories of the past and attends the 12 houses at the same time? As good as it was to see the flashback (manga only) of Aiolos and Saga, the scene is meaningless. Athena struck by the golden apple and in a coma, immediately after the 12 houses, to do the same thing again and be original? NO COMMENT. The participation of Erda and Xiaoling? Needless. EvilSaga who dominates the fight with Aiolia all the time, but does not kill him and he wins at random? Absurd filler. Eris who can&#039;t kill 5 girls, and Shoko who confronts and exorcises her, so by chance, defeating her? NO SENSE!<br />
<br />
<br />
Do we want to raise another problem? The CONTINUITY.<br />
<br />
Kuori&#039;s manga is FAITHFUL to the original manga, just in a manic way (although the recent Origin has put it out of continuity). <br />
<br />
This was the problem of Sho anime from the start. I mean, the original manga and the classic anime have two different continuities (having numerous differences), the Sho anime should have followed the manga line (since the Sho manga story is based on the manga, not the anime), despite being already inconsistent using the colors of the anime.<br />
<br />
Toei, as usual, has messed up, a chaotic mixture, inconsistent with everything. Between narrative changes and various inconsistencies (we want to talk about the Hyoga bandage at 12 houses, or Ikki that remains at the end, when in the manga is wiped out?), The story is out of any continuity.<br />
<br />
Sho anime is not consistent with the classic anime (as the 12 houses are different, and soon after Asgard follows). It is not consistent with the original manga (for Origin, for the colors of the characters, and other changes). It is not even consistent with the Sho manga (as the story differs and ends, in fact after the 12 houses).<br />
<br />
<br />
VERY BAD ADAPTATION from the manga, and ZERO CONTINUITY with everything. All this for editorial choices, because more than 10 episodes didn&#039;t want to do. What a disappointment.<br />
<br />
There will be something good if the story is painful. Characters? Not that they had much time. The clashes? Even those, if not 1-2, the rest is anonymous (or horrible, as in the case of the final with Eris).<br />
<br />
<br />
ART: 5<br />
<br />
When you thought Omega and SoG were ugly, but after seeing Sho and his animations, you realize that they weren&#039;t so bad.<br />
<br />
There is good and bad.<br />
<br />
The static drawings, and the close-ups of the characters, in particular of the gold saints, are very well made, beautiful. <br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/aYJMcLR.jpg<br />
<br />
Yeah, for the close-ups, perhaps here we have THE BEST OF SS, after the classic.<br />
<br />
The problem is the animations, very bad, especially at the beginning, unwatchable. Not to mention the often fluctuating quality, even in important moments. For example, at the 12 houses, very well done, then the part of Saga&#039;s suicide, a fail. Or the episode 8, the worst. <br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/M9Kn3tz.jpg<br />
<br />
And so you wonder how such a drastic drop is possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND: 6<br />
<br />
Normal. Some good music has it, even if nothing memorable.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 6<br />
<br />
As already mentioned, Sho, in addition to taking on the classic characters, would have unpublished and good characters, but the anime, between the changes and the little time that dedicates them, fails. <br />
<br />
Classics: some have a quick appearance, others are central. Essentially, the most important would be Saori Kido and the gold saints that survived the 12 houses. Beyond that Saga and Deathmask, but the second one has been omitted.<br />
<br />
Athena in Sho&#039;s manga is ... excellent, more compassionate, active and similar to the goddess of war. But the anime of Sho cuts his best moments up to there, and besides (for the great originality) he makes her hit by the golden apple and end up in a coma again, like good useless. Thanks, Toei.<br />
<br />
For the others, Milo is the golden protagonist, EvilSaga as an enemy, enough space also has Aiolia. The others not.<br />
<br />
Saintias and inedited: In this first part, essentially only Shoko, and sister Kyoko, have some kind of development. Katya and Mii have just a hint. Xiao and Erda weren&#039;t even that (since the part of Cassiopeia was omitted).<br />
<br />
Mayura as the manga, the other minor role.<br />
<br />
Enemies: Eris here is altered, compared to the manga, in the usual cliché of the arrogant god (while in the manga it becomes devious, strategic, and even more human, after it merges with Kyoko). Ate, Phonos and Emony have even less prominence than the manga. The only good is Rigel.<br />
<br />
And, as already mentioned, the debuts of characters like Mania, Dysnomia, Aeson, and other successive dryads are missing (since the war in the anime ends there).<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 5<br />
<br />
It&#039;s nice to see the close-ups of characters well-made, Milo almost the protagonist, some scenes from the 12 houses, and perhaps the clash with EvilSaga, but in general the series is DISAPPOINTING in several respects.<br />
<br />
I will be repetitive, but I repeat: READ THE MANGA, it&#039;s another thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only good thing, given Toei&#039;s narrative freedoms and the hurry to end the war with Eris, are the final final seconds of episode 10, with &quot;the appearance of a certain character&quot;, which would be a great possibility, for one of the most dreamed wars in SS by fans. We only hope with more episodes for decent development, and better graphics quality, if it should be done.

    this anime .... sigh<br />
<br />
so saintia shou is like none other  of the saint seiya anime series why you may ask?<br />
<br />
simple, saintia shou feels like a bad fanfiction created by a girl.any type of manly bravery is gone, reduced to atoms, instead we have beautiful men with luscious hair and in sparkling armor coming to save young ladies in trouble, from athena to shoko. <br />
<br />
most of the saint seiya entries never had amazing plot, but this one is just histerically bad, the villains never felt good , not enough development on their side and eris is just a joke, the worst she ever did in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323233">
        the entire series is that she made some saints fight and some already dead souls come back to life. noone died, noone got injured, nothing, absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
The worst though is probably the saints, these &quot;saintias&quot; almost never work as &quot;athena&#039;s shadow&quot; as the story wants to believe, and they are saints they are not something else since they were a saint&#039;s cloth they don&#039;t wear a special saintia cloth,yet almost none of them wear masks, the only new character we saw that is a female and wears a mask is the peacock saint. and probably the most reasonable character in the entire series. these santias never really feel like a normal saint wood that would trade their life at any point if it meant to save athena, they are all very soft and without much reason to fight. for some reason they were stronger than silver saints although seiya and the others were getting absolutely destroyed by silver back in the original. and this anime makes you want to believe that the events happen simultaneously but there are so many issues in terms of the timeline it really makes no sense.<br />
<br />
This version of Athena is the worst it has ever been, really week, really vulnerable but dumb and trying to go alone in the place of the main enemy. enough about the characters that both lack the depth and the motivation to even be there, especially that more than 80% through the anime, it sends in a saint we have never seen on the screen before and wants to care for her, and feel like &quot;they have come so far to get here&quot; where besides 3 which we saw relatively early we really don&#039;t know anything about them, i would say we barely know anything about any of the characters. And enough about the females the males were not that great either, they do their job well enough as golden saints at being strong and stuff but almost all of them lack any of the complex and more serious nature. <br />
<br />
Now to talk about the art, this is by far the worst looking saint seiya entry, and what is really sad is that during the pauses at the middle of the episode we see the manga art of the girls, and it looks, so so so much better than the anime, Athena in the 1988 anime looked leagues better than this Athena in the anime, the special effects for stuff like the attacks are also very lazy and boring, only in episode 9 i saw just something a bit better in the punching move of the MC, but it&#039;s still worse than any of the other ryu sei ken&#039;s i ever saw. the animation overall of the anime is also pretty boring and bland, the character designs all look really weird. it feels like a 1 girl team made everything in this anime. the fact that i think at parts the 1988 anime looks better than this says a lot.<br />
<br />
probably the best thing about this anime is the mediocre soundtrack, worse than most of othe saint seiya entries from the past,but still good enough that you don&#039;t mind watching the anime with sounds on.<br />
<br />
enjoyment: the worst thing about this anime is that it doesn&#039;t even carry on the feeling of the original saint seiya in anyway, you could maybe argue that the golden saints are not that far away in terms of character, and that still mostly carries on to saga, milo and aiolia, besides 1 of the saintias none of them really care for athena and/or following her around as a shadow. i have heard that the manga is better but i review the anime a 4/10 since it lacks almost everything the original had and it is no doubt the worst entry in the saint seiya animated series.

    When I was a child, I used to enjoy this kind of anime very much. I didn&#039;t care if the character&#039;s background stories were lame or the anime plot itself was awful, I simply lied in front of the TV for the whole episodes and anxiously waited &#039;til next week to see what would happen after.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a pity I&#039;m not a kid anymore.<br />
<br />
When Saintia Sho was annouced, I jumped with joy. Finally I would see a kind of &quot;what if the saints were girls?&quot;. Then I waited for it, watched the episodes... And got upset. I would say that at least the manga is truly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334626">
        a work of art, but I&#039;m trying to focus on the anime - in which the art is the worst. Not in a Nanatsu no Taizai level but still awful. Sometimes the shadows are just wrong, sometimes the characters&#039; bodies are terrible, sometimes the art guys don&#039;t even try to make their work well. You can just feel that they are doing that whitout giving a fuck about what you, spectator, will think about later. They don&#039;t even draw some faces correctly. <br />
<br />
I cannot complain very much about the plot as it is set just for a Saint Seiya spin-off but it could be better. I know I&#039;m reviewing an anime made for kiddos but Sailor Moon aims the same (and both of them are made by Toei) AND it still impresses me. The battle scenes are way better (I&#039;m talking about the Crystal remake) &amp; the villains too. I&#039;m disapointed with the Saintia Sho anime &amp; I hope Toei stops thinking that children anime have to be made in a careless way.

    ***NO SPOILER REVIEW****<br />
When I first came across Saintia Shou and skimmed over the reviews, it gave me the impression of a half-baked show which people hated. However, as has unfortunately regularly been the case for many of the Saint Seiya shows after the original, the negative general trend of nostalgic reviewers have nothing to do with the actual quality of the show when seen with fresh eyes.<br />
<br />
Saintia Shou is full bore Saint Seiya, with strong saints, key Saint Seiya elements and over-the-top melodrama wrapped in a classic feel. Sure, it has several shoujo elements such as petals flying around sometimes and magical girl elements but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406983">
        that&#039;s just a stylistic choice for this genre, the actual story is great and feels like Saint Seiya, only with a focus on female protagonists while much of the original show is happening in parallel.<br />
<br />
Saint Seiya exists in a multiverse and this show&#039;s story is an alternate universe where much of the original show&#039;s events happen in parallel to the adventures of the Saintias however the new elements are where the main attraction lies. The show brings back Eris, a character from the first anime movie, expands her mythology and creates several interesting relations to follow as well as interesting world developments. The Gold Saints have a key role to play as well with the Bronze and Silver Saints crossing paths with the Saintias occasionally. Surprisingly, the Saint Seiya feel is preserved while working well with these characters as the female warriors are imbued with several of the characteristics usually associated with their male counterparts without taking away from their uniqueness.<br />
<br />
Technically, the show is competently animated, the music is classic and great and the visuals are solid. Apparently the manga is much better (some of the negative reviews point that out) but without that baggage the anime is enjoyable and definitely got me interested in checking out the manga. The story also wraps up well and considering the manga is still ongoing changes to the scenario to achieve that are understandable (again, didn&#039;t read the manga when watching and enjoyed the anime).<br />
<br />
TL;DR: This is a great and underrated show, watch it with an open mind and you&#039;ll have a lot of fun seeing what new things this story brings to the mythos while having strong female characters. It&#039;s a Saint Seiya show deserving of the name.
