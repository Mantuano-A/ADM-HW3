    Okay guys, let&#039;s talk about Medabots, the American consumerist Super robot competition series. I&#039;ll start by saying this: Fuck Yeah Medabots.<br />
<br />
This is a show that stands the test of time against all odds. Other toy marketing series like Beyblade, B-Damon and Bakugan were ephemeral things, they existed just to push their products and then were forgotten immediately as soon as a new thing popped up. That&#039;s because the shows sucked. They had no heart, no personality. Other franchise series like the old seasons of YuGiOh, Pokemon and Duel Masters, however, are remembered fondly by the people who watched them so many years ago. That&#039;s because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37216">
        those shows rocked. They had interesting characters, stories and wacky hijinks. Medabots is part of that club too.<br />
<br />
The premise is that everyone who matters in the world has their own companion fighting robot that helps them do chores and commit acts of arson and assault. It&#039;s fucking cool. I mean, Pokemon lets kids have giant dragons and stuff, but this shows premise is literally &quot;everyone gets a midget-sized Mazinger&quot;. People have a tendency to have their robots duke it out (in public) to settle disputes and get swag. Why can&#039;t the real world be this way?<br />
<br />
And so the story revolves  around this kid named Ikki. He&#039;s a lovable little runt with an attitude. He&#039;s also a loser because he&#039;s the only one at his school who doesn&#039;t own a pet robot armed with missiles, guns and other deadly weapons. Well one day he breaks open his piggy bank and buys one at his local 7-11 (convenience stores are badass in the 22nd century apparently), and thus Metabee is born. Ikki then goes on misadventures with his new pal for 50 or so episodes, fighting evil, battling dudes from all over the world, etc.<br />
<br />
Sweet premise aside, the characters are what shine in this show. Medabots has a very big cast full of colorful and entertaining characters. Ikki is cool lead. He&#039;s a do-gooder, but he&#039;s also a 10-year old. He&#039;s a sarcastic hotshot who likes his women and really just wants to kick ass at what he does. His partner is Metabee. Metabee is an asshole. He&#039;s a freeloader, a know-it-all, talks like a black dude and is generally awesome in every way. He&#039;s like Pikachu from the first episode of Pokemon, if he sounded like a jive surfer Darth Vader. And he stays that way. He grows and works well with Ikki over time, but he never loses the flair that makes him fun to watch. When he fights, he has catchphrases like &quot;Dude, I rock.&quot; It&#039;s impossible to not love Metabee. <br />
<br />
All of Ikki&#039;s friends are pretty entertaining. Between the hotblooded reporter girl who follows him around, the incompetent bullies, the rich kid rival and his dense, but ever-loving rich girl crush, there&#039;s no lack of personality in the main cast. There&#039;s also this epic thief bro named the Phantom Renegade, whose secret identity is one of the most intriguing and intricate mysteries I&#039;ve ever seen in anime. <br />
<br />
The bad guys are the RubberRobo Gang. They&#039;re the best villains I&#039;ve seen in this kind of show. They&#039;re like a mix between Team Rocket and the Monarch&#039;s henchmen from Venture Bros. All of their interactions and silly secret identities are witty in their absurdity, and they grow gradually as characters throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Rounding out the pack is Rokusho. Rokusho is his own Medabot, a manly wayward samurai-type character whose name is treated as majestically as it should be by the rest of the cast. He mentors Metabee in the art of firing huge fucking lasers out of his fists.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, did I forget Mr. Referee? Mr. Referee is a deity who has the power to teleport wherever he&#039;s needed on the planet, showing up where you least expect him to. He shows up every episode to provide critical commentary on whatever fight is taking place. Truly one of the most iconic parts of this series.<br />
<br />
On the writing side, Medabots is almost never serious. It&#039;s never wacky or over the top either. Most of the comedy comes from the characters being themselves and interacting, while the rest comes from a self-awareness the show has about what&#039;s going on. It doesn&#039;t take itself seriously, but still manages to deliver solid characterization and story for a shounen battle series. It doesn&#039;t treat the viewer like they&#039;re stupid, and doesn&#039;t pretend to be deeper than what it is.<br />
<br />
Medabots (Or as the Japanese wrongly call it, Medarot) is an American series. A lot of what&#039;s good about this show is the result of Westernization, not just due to pieces of script and acting, but the series itself. America rearranged the order of the episodes entirely, and it works out pretty well for the most part. In the Japanese version, it&#039;s basically 30 straight episodes of &quot;battle of the week&quot; before the story kicks in, but America remade it so the show has two distinct arcs that are paced nicely.<br />
<br />
It does create a tiny hole or two though. Four episodes in particular shoud have been in the first half of the series, but in order to cleanly make two 26-episode seasons, they had to be moved round. You can watch them in the first season if you want, but the only holes they create are things like Ikki having a certain part or one of the side characters having a new bot which show up in the season 1 finale, but the episodes where those things first appear are in season 2. <br />
<br />
One of things that sticks out most about Medabots is the art style. Everyone has this kind of roundy-boxy cartoonish look to them, but it&#039;s kind of cool and stylish. I like it, it&#039;s unique and visually pleasing too. The designs for the robots are unlike any other anime, they&#039;re distinctly &quot;Medabot&quot;. The animation is generally nothing stunning, but it&#039;s consistently good. The cinematography is dynamic and keeps things on screen looking cool or exciting regardless of what&#039;s happening. It reminds me a bit of Gainax&#039;s stuff in that respect, though obviously it&#039;s not as jaw-dropping. There&#039;s something about the choice of colors too, I think they used predominately warm hues in this show, kind of like FLCL. It&#039;s just pleasant.<br />
<br />
Music? Are you kidding me? <br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzPMAsYkGMo<br />
Shows from this era had a thing about catchy rock anthems to get the kids all excited, and this hit the nail on the head. The BGM and sound effects were always satisfying. Bullets and explosion noises, rock beats in the background, etc. You&#039;re not going to be scouring the internet for an OST, but it gets the job done well.<br />
<br />
So yeah, Medabots. It&#039;s kind of like a super robot show, it&#039;s kind of like a sports series, it&#039;s kind of like a shounen action romp, and it&#039;s all good. It&#039;s the perfect mixture of humor and badass, and though all of the toys and video games are long gone, it&#039;s still a distinctly good and watchable show for any fan of battle or classic fight of the week super robot series. Marketing series nowadays could learn a lot from it. <br />

    Time to review one of my favorite Anime geared towards kids. Every episode I&#039;ve seen has been from the dub version since there aren&#039;t any known subs and I thought the dub was well done. <br />
<br />
Just so you know, in certain areas, only aired 26 episodes despite that all 52 episodes were eventually dubbed. From episodes 1-39, they cut 13 so some of you might have missed some episodes. This was confusing when I revisited the series but most of the episodes they cut were &quot;filler&quot; episodes which isn&#039;t so bad. I skipped a lot of these episodes to get to the plot and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22565">
        ending which is why I haven&#039;t finished the series at the time I am writing this though I&#039;ll definitely get to finishing it.<br />
<br />
Story: To me, it seems like a parody of Pokemon and to some extent mecha Anime. The story&#039;s basically Pokemon with robots. Many of the episodes consist of the mains having their Medabots fighting other random Medabots over a misunderstanding or some dispute. Pretty basic for a Pokemon-like series. There are a few good plots here and there that were very entertaining as the show moved past the &quot;get to know our characters&quot; stage. The best episodes (At least to me) are when the Rubberrobo Gang gets serious and Rokusho appearances. However even the &quot;filler&quot; type episodes have merit in that the character interactions provide lots of laughs and while not much happens, they&#039;re still worth watching. This is a kids dub so older viewers will notice corny jokes and dialogue but it&#039;s to be expected. I will admit that the dub sometimes doesn&#039;t make everything 100% clear to the viewer and they made a mistake with how Metabee got his name later but whatever. There&#039;s another part where one character obtains *Spoiler* when the character shouldn&#039;t be able to. They never go back to explain why. The character just has it for the sake of plot. After watching the ending, I have so many unanswered questions that can only be answered through playing the Game Boy games this show is based on. One thing that bothers me about adaptations is that if something&#039;s weird or doesn&#039;t make sense people will say &quot;You didn&#039;t read the book/comic.&quot; or &quot;You didn&#039;t play the game.&quot; I shouldn&#039;t need to do either of those things to understand a show. Why can&#039;t the show tell me? I guess Medabots is still good enough that the flaws won&#039;t kill the score but one character&#039;s past is so interesting that he should have his own spin-off so they can explain everything instead of me having to track down ancient games.<br />
<br />
Art: This is where I have a serious problem with this show. I thought it was really old when I first saw it but on this site, it says Medabots aired in 1999. For its time, the animation would be considered &quot;bad&quot;. There are a few episodes that looked pretty good but some scenes looked pretty horrible. The art is incredibly inconsistent and you&#039;ll notice it between episodes. There is also a major abuse of reused scenes/stock footage. It&#039;s really annoying and it&#039;s one of the biggest things that bother me about the animation of Anime besides vertical black lines under a character&#039;s eyes. I&#039;m not completely sure if this is making fun of mecha Anime which more often than not likes to abuse stock footage but it just gets really annoying to see the same thing over the course of around 40 episodes parody or not. I suppose it&#039;s a staple of long running kids Anime though...<br />
<br />
Sound: I checked out an episode in Japanese and the dub used a different soundtrack so I&#039;ll use the dub&#039;s music for this review, although there isn&#039;t much to say. The music isn&#039;t really bad or annoying, but I can&#039;t say I really like any of the tracks either. A couple of them stand out like Rokusho&#039;s theme and this Eye of the Tiger thing. Those stand out a bit for me. The American theme song is actually okay. Lyrics are small in amount and not exactly the best but it gets you pumped. I do have to make a note about the Japanese opening which is awesome. It&#039;s just such a badass song sung by Metabee&#039;s voice actor: Takeuchi Junko who I&#039;m sure most of you would recognize as Naruto. It&#039;s really worth a listen as it&#039;s a kind of song that gets your blood pumping and the opening sequence fits the song pretty well.<br />
<br />
The dub voice actors are pretty good. No one is incredibly annoying and most of the voices fit well. The characters and voice actors section on this site is severely lacking for this show which is unfortunate. I&#039;d really like to know who played Rokusho, Seaslug and the Phantom Renegade because their voices really stuck out and being good actors, they were very entertaining to listen to.<br />
<br />
One thing I&#039;d like to tack onto the abuse of stock footage and reused scenes thing is that the dub seems to reuse certain soundbytes. I mainly notice this when Metabee uses a *Spoiler* attack or wins a fight with a &quot;Dude, I rock.&quot; line. It wouldn&#039;t be so bad if they re-recorded the voice actor saying the quotes but at times, it sounds really unnatural especially to someone who has seen many episodes. This pretty much only happens with Metabee since he has the most catchphrases. Even in normal conversation you&#039;ll hear a familiar &quot;What!?&quot; or &quot;Oh, now I&#039;m really angry!&quot; because it probably is the same one you heard some episodes ago. This is the first time I&#039;ve heard of &quot;stock dialogue&quot;.<br />
<br />
Character: I liked a lot of the characters. I&#039;m sure most people would like Metabee, Rokusho, Henry and his personas. They&#039;re all pretty badass and whenever they show up you just know something cool&#039;s going to happen. Who could forget Mr. Referee and his out of nowhere appearances? Of course there are annoying characters too but at times they do contribute to the comedy of the show so it&#039;s not that bad. There isn&#039;t that much character development unfortunately besides the usual &quot;got better at Robattling&quot; because they needed to. An 8 here because they make &quot;filler&quot; enjoyable which is quite a task. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I didn&#039;t really enjoy the final 13 episodes of the series that much because most of the tournament fights only last 3 minutes which means they spent a little less than 20 minutes doing other things. If you get that far, you&#039;ll see what I mean. The fights aren&#039;t that amazing despite what the plot is at that time and these last episodes seemed sloppily written. This is supposed to close the show too so I was pretty disappointed. There are also inconsistencies like Metabee&#039;s messed up in some way but can fight fine a few minutes later. I can&#039;t forget to mention the large bunch of reused scenes. Finally, there is a severe lack of Rokusho after 39 which is a disappointment. You really want him to participate and they totally could&#039;ve used him at the time too. Despite that, this has to be one of the best dubs I&#039;ve seen among kids Anime. The show makes me laugh without trying too hard and while they aren&#039;t skyscrapers tall, the Medabots are very cool so this deserves a 9.<br />
<br />
Overall: I certainly think it deserves a spot higher than the 2400s but it did beat out most of the Pokemon stuff which is nice to see. There isn&#039;t really a type of Anime viewer I would recommend this to. I played a disc of this when I was hanging out with my friends. They couldn&#039;t stop watching and they laughed throughout the episodes. This is a very fun series to watch and the dub deserves lots of credit. They made very little cuts for a kids dub, didn&#039;t eradicate all traces of Japanese words and the plot seems somewhat consistent with the original. Also most of the names of the characters are kept from the Japanese version along with the pronunciations which is very cool. Best part might be calling the series &quot;Medabots&quot; instead of sticking with &quot;Medarots&quot;. They&#039;re robots that make use of &quot;medals&quot; which makes them &quot;medal robots&quot; and both names make sense but seriously &quot;Medabots&quot; sounds so much better. Even though the averages don&#039;t add up to it, I&#039;m calling it an 8 but I&#039;d like to give it a 9. <br />

Thank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped.

    This is a show where one of the bad guys’ schemes is to redesign every house in a city. They wreck the house and rebuild as a Moai, a Pinocchio or a ukulele.<br />
<br />
A little introduction so you’ll know what we’re talking about.<br />
<br />
It can be scary to revisit an old childhood favorite. We’re easily impressed when we’re young because we haven’t experienced much. The first chocolate always tastes great, but it becomes ordinary the more types you try. Old favorites can have something cool in them, like battles and explosions but after a few years they made you glad you’ve grown.<br />
<br />
I am a critical man who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195638">
        often tires people in discussions. How surprised I was that Medabots was as good as I remembered. Sometimes, it’s even better.<br />
<br />
It’s part of the wave of shows that were one big advertisement, like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Beyblade and Pokemon. Yet it tries its best to rise above it. This is not an anime that creates a battle system and a story that’s completely unrelated to it. Medabots‘ story is tied to its setting. You can’t tell the same story in Pokemon‘s or Yu-Gi-Oh!‘s world.<br />
<br />
It often feels like Medabots was made by a bunch of guys who looked at battle shounen cliches, and decided to mess with them. Subversions are everywhere. The bad guys often make no sense at all. Their schemes involve building weird houses and a zoo full of penguins. It’s a response to the litany of dull villains who are evil because they’re evil. It points out how goofy the whole world domination is.<br />
<br />
The RubberRobo Gang may not have an opposing worldview (although the series gets to that later). They remain evil for evil’s sake throughout the series, but their goofiness gives them humanity. They stop being villains, and become just a bunch of crazies who watched Digimon Adventure and thought they could be Miyotismon.<br />
<br />
Ikki himself is a fairly different hero. He starts off as a loser, and remains a bit of one. He’s not given ‘sheer determination’ or ‘heart of gold’ for defining attributes. He’s defined more by his naive passion towards medabots (who are actually weapons). Sometimes anime love to give a quality like recklessness for a ‘flaw’, but it’s often one that ends up helping the hero and gives him charm.<br />
<br />
Ikki is a narcisstic and brat who swings from adoring himself to giving up. He’s an average dude with dreams of glory but who actually has to go through hardship to gain it. He’s never truly heroic. He’s allowed to lose and to be an asshole. Ikki often loses not because he deals with a strong opponenet, but because he thinks too much of himself (or not enough about his partner). It’s the opposite of characters who shoot fireballs because they have enough faith in themselves.<br />
<br />
Where the series truly outshines everyone else is when it questions its premise, and presents characters with alternative worldviews.<br />
<br />
Rokusho is a pacifist. In a world where everyone is obsessed with shooting missiles at the other’s robots, he just likes to look at insects. A series of events lead him to a breakdown and eventually, to a robattle. This isn’t the fun battles of previous. This is a robot fighting because he genuinaly wants to hurt to destroy. This is also the moment when Robo-Emperor appears, who is classified as weapon-type.<br />
<br />
This is when the series doesn’t just let the premise give us cool battles. It questions it. It forces the viewer to be reminded that, even though these medabots are cool they are in the end weapons. The whole final arc revolves around this theme. Unlike Evangelion, Medabots can explore its themes without having to resort to two episodes of inner monologues.<br />
<br />
Its treatment of the subject matter is also very mature. It looks further than the pacifist/violence dichotomy. It’s a series where weapons are both used for fun sports and for destruction. It gives us various views – Rokusho’s pacifism, Ikki’s naivety, Victor’s cynicism and Aki’s greed. Even the way it ends is not by just getting stronger, but by destroying two giant weapons of war. Medabots’ view is that violence is fine, so long as its for sport.<br />
<br />
The series doesn’t use this exploration to go slack on any other department. In fact, because everything else in the series is so good that it can be easy to miss this little bit of philosophy.<br />
<br />
Before it goes deep, it’s a hilarious slice of life anime full of odd characters. It celebrates the characters’ goofiness. There is a running theme of narcissism here, where everyone thinks of themselves as bigger than they are. That sometimes ruins the halo of even the talented ones, like Dr. Aki. Spike remains a loser who doesn’t progress by becoming a winner, but by still trying. Karin is a love interest who refuses to play the role and remains oblivious to her admirers.<br />
<br />
This is why the climax feels so powerful. The series establishes that all these people have a life of their own. These characters don’t just live for the journey. Rather, the journey is what happens between ordinary days. This is the role most of the lighter episodes. Some of them are pretty weak, but they’re an integral part of the experience. The climax wouldn’t be so powerful if the climax was the only thing there was.<br />
<br />
The series also doesn’t forget to let us enjoy the coolness of medabots. Almost everyone of them is beautifully designed. Whereas most Digimon are just exaggerated versions of real-life animals and objects, Medabots has a style of its own. It creates a template and then forces various things – gorillas, beetles, kings – fit it. It’s always interesting to examine every medabot and see how they morphed the original subject to fit the style.<br />
<br />
The action scenes are often brief, but intense. Despite the Medaforce serving as One-Hit-KO in many episodes, plenty of time rely on an actual startergy. The oppponent’s medabot has a certain style that Ikki and Metabee have to overcome. It means most opponents are defeated by just one missile, but first Ikki has to get them in a position where he could shoot the missile. The last robattle between team Japan and team Kenya also deserves an honorable mention. A fight so intense and beautifully animated it will keep me coming back.<br />
<br />
There is also Mr. Referee, who teleports whenever there’s a robattle. It’s a complete absurdity that everyone is fine with. Then again, isn’t life absurd?<br />
<br />
There are some flaws, of course. There are explorations that remain undeveloped, including a weird alien thing that doesn’t feel like it belongs. The battle system isn’t exactly well-thought-out in terms of specifics. There are some useless episodes and the Medolarian backstory needed more screen time. A series’ greatness isn’t measured by its lack of flaws, though. A series that just avoids flaws is like a food that avoids unpleasant tastes. More impressive is a series that overcome the flaws. It’s an anime that could be trimmed and polished on the sides, but the end result is full of fun characters, a deep exploration of a subject, goofy scenarios, intense fights and a fantastic. The last six episodes can only be watched in sitting. Despite the occasional flaw, it’s a rich anime full of many good things. Maybe that’s why it wasn’t so popular. It’s far more experimental. Thankfully, the experiment is more successful than anything I hope an anime can be.<br />

    I like medabots a lot, it was a fun concept. Robots with interchangeable parts you win off people. I had so many questions about this show when i was younger, like why anyone would let there kids gamble with expensive robot parts they payed for or they&#039;d let kids play with robots that have live ammunition. As a adult all i could think about is how much gang warfare musta advanced.<br />
<br />
Anyway onto the review, medabots was a show designed to move merchandise but it kept a actual plot which was nice and it wasn&#039;t silly like shoot beads or spinning tops that suddenly got faster.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79312">
         It was like robots shooting missiles and bullets while kids gamble. This gave it more of a pokemon quality where battles were fun to watch and it even shocked you with letting the hero lose now and again! It really is like pokemon tho with its silly gag gang enemy who gets sent off into the sunset nearly every episode and normally the defeat of a new friend/rival. It eventually grows a real plot and you get to watch them take down a whole organization and a mad scientist so unlike pokemon you get a pay off for watching.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are always pretty fun and enjoyable even if nothing is spectacular. Its a pretty standard style anime that&#039;s really just cool cause of all the robot fighting! I do like that robots all look different and have good color schemes.<br />
<br />
Characters, well you got a very standard set of characters. Unlikely hero, his sorta girl friend, his unjustifiably angry rival with a inferiority complex. A fun addition is a gang of kids who like to bully the main character and help him once and awhile. Then you got the adult gang who always get defeated by a group of 10 year olds for some reason. I don&#039;t particularly have a favorite character or even a noteworthy comment about any of them, they are just a standard set of characters.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy watching this show cause its just fun to watch,Robots battling isn&#039;t that what its all about? so if you like shows like pokemon but aren&#039;t pokemon and eventually have a logical and satisfying conclusion, Watch medabots.

    More Medabots! More Power! Review of Medabots (Seasons 1 &amp; 2)<br />
<br />
Story/Characters (8/10): The show actually had a good story even though the plot is incredibly similar to another more popular show. It starts off with a boy who wants to have a robot who later desires to compete in a robot competition to see who is the best robot champion. Seems familiar, wouldn&#039;t you say? Just replace robot with Pokemon.<br />
Even though the show has a Pokemon-esque feel to it, the show makes up for it by having badass, relatable and funny characters. The badass/funny character being the Phantom Renegade. Relatability, belongs to the main characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195500">
        (Ikki Tenryo and Metabee) and his friends. The funny characters would have to be Mr. Referee and the RubberRobo Gang (their version of Team Rocket). The show does have its fair share of filler episodes along with the reusing of scenes but its not that bad.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation (7/10): The art/animation looks old (1999) but the show is still watchable.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music (9/10): The opening (American and Japanese) theme songs for the show was catchy and energising. All of the sounds were used appropriately. Though, there is one flaw that I&#039;d like to point out, which is the copy-and-paste dialogue that Metabee uses. Lines like &quot;Dude, I rock.&quot;, &quot;Missiles launch.&quot; and etc. are reused throughout the show which made the show seem a bit repetitive.<br />
<br />
Dub or Sub?: Both. I saw this dubbed and the voice actors did a very good job. The sub was also commendable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Summary/Overall (8/10): The show was good, funny and the flaws were minor. Though, it is unfortunate that the lovable characters from the show will not be seen again in Season 3. (FYI, the series switched hands from Bee Train to Production I.G. for Season 3.)<br />

    When i grew up, it was that time when Pokemon and metabots became a thing in Europe, and i easily felt for them both. <br />
<br />
Despite they have the same story structure, i honestly preferred metabots  a little bit more. There was action in it, they managed to keep up the entertainment, and even if there was, it didn&#039;t feel like there were any fillers. And the characters in the fillers had a comeback in the end, so maybe they weren&#039;t fillers, just randomly ep to get more characters in the end. <br />
<br />
Now that i&#039;m older and i re-watched it, i got a more clear

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346339">
        picture of the anime. <br />
Story is still super interesting, it still feels like its a lot of action in it.  It still drags me in, poking my curiosity and hunger for wanting to know what happens next. <br />
<br />
What i really disliked about the story, is actually the ending. I know there are some &quot;fillers&quot; in this anime, but if they put them in there and then ask in the end of each ep &quot;will they ever... ??&quot; and then in the end of the series ending up not telling us what the answers is really, made me irritated. (not gonna say whom, but ) what about all the previous friends of ikki, who in the end joined the finall battle. WHAT HAPPEN TO THEM AFTER ???? <br />
<br />
Season 3 is a following story of ikki (after the championship), but its still not explained what happen to em ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Moving over to the positive side of sounds:<br />
The intro is catching, a little monotom, but catchy. The sounds effect in anime is good to make u feel the atmosphere, consider it was made &quot;back in the days&quot;. <br />
<br />
What i DID NOT like about the sound was the &quot;outro&quot; is the same has the intro, and u get very very fast fed up listening to intro-anime-intro-intro-anime-intro-intro if u watch many ep after each other. and specially for 3 seasons, DESPITE that the intro video changes in season 3. <br />
<br />
The art i cant really tell so much about, im not a HQ 4k person. I perfer anime from late 90s beginning 00. They are smoothly enough for my taste.  But i like how they always draw the characters very fun and a unrealistic when they try to make a funny moment of it.  Specially when it comes to some joke, which only adults finds funny.<br />
<br />
Along with how the characters are drawn are based on their personality, and i honestly i love most of them. Even the out-siders character which are just there to ro-battle ikki, still shows a personality. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Over all, i really enjoy this anime, and i really recommand it. Ofc there are some small things i found irritated about, cause i hate being left with questions (kinda open endings), But if u really like an action filled, interesting anime which sucks u in, with max 6 fillers eps, kinda ish like pokemon but a little bit better (structure wise) i really recommand u watching it.

    Absolute classic. Picked up the VHS of the first 6 episodes at my local Giant Tiger. Never loved anything more. I remember playing with my MEtabee figure while my parents redid our hardwood floors. Classic childhood moment. Pretty epic that when you lose a fight in the Metabot world your robot&#039;s limbs become forfeit to the enemy. What do they even do with the limbs? Was this ever answered in the show? Never found another VHS past the first 6 episodes so I don&#039;t know. Someone, please update me. Metabee for life. Also got some funny hahas in the show cause Metabee likes melons from

    Medabots was an interesting though strange anime to watch.  It was enjoyable, but should you watch all 52 Episodes, let&#039;s find out.  The first season of Medabots, or in other words, the first 26 Episodes of Medabots are deserving of an 8 Overall, but the last 13 which I watched dragged it down to a 7 Overall.  The English adaptation of Medabots switched the order of the 52 Episode original Japanese Medabots or Medarot, making 13 Episodes (27-39) unnecessary to watch.  They were mostly filler episodes anyways.  The last 13 Episodes (40-52) weren&#039;t as good or as fulfilling as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335765">
        ending given at the end of the first season.<br />
<br />
The art was just okay or average.  The fights were good but not great, like the classics.  The fights were bolstered somewhat by very good sound effects and soundtrack.  The Metabee classic beetle mania, he makes a sound kind of like a Popeye laugh.  The opening and closing songs keep you craving more.<br />
<br />
The characters are very good and well thought out from: Icchi to Koji to Karen to Phantom Renegade.  The side characters were given a lot of thought and they never feel like a waste of space or time in this case.  The story was complete at the end of the first 26 English episodes, in my opinion.  I took a break at the end of the first 13 Episodes, but the story never drags.  <br />
<br />
I enjoyed this series very much and it&#039;s worth a trip to the 22nd Century to watch it!

    The best way I can describe Medabots is Pokemon, but with robots instead of Pokemon. <br />
Pokemon: &quot;Gotta catch&#039;em all&quot;<br />
Medabots: &quot;More Medabots, more power&quot; <br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
<br />
Each episode involves Medabee and Ikki robattling a new opponent and occasionally stopping the Rubber Robo Gang and whatever evil plan they have this time. The action scenes are all exciting and fun to watch with different medabots using different weapons and fighting styles and seeing how Ikki finds someway to beat them. <br />
<br />
Between the action scenes, the show also has some funny comedy provided by the Rubber Robo Gang and their ridiculous stunts. <br />
<br />
One complaint I have with the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247261">
        is I felt there was too much filler. There were like five or six episodes in between Ikki getting into the World Tournament and the tournament actually starting. For a while I kept saying &quot;OK, when is this tournament going to start?&quot;<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10<br />
<br />
I love seeing the friendship develop between Ikki and Medabee; it starts with Medbee refusing to accept Ikki as his Meda-fighter, but Ikki and Medabee slowly learn to work together and become a real team. I like it when relationships between characters develop naturally like this instead of two characters instantly becoming friends as soon as they meet. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I like how much more personality Medabee has compared to the other medabots; the other medabots are so quiet and composed, but Medabee vividly expresses his emotions when he gets angry or sad. <br />
<br />
Another great character is Henry (Hikaru) who adds a bit of mystery to the show, seeing as he is the Phantom Renegade (and that isn&#039;t a spoiler because it&#039;s like Tuxedo Mask in Sailor Moon, it&#039;s obviously Henry). A lot of questions surround Henry: Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Why does the Phantom only steal Medals? What happened at the World Robattle Championships eight years ago? <br />
<br />
The Rubber Robo Gang really did their job as the show&#039;s main comic reliefs. It was so funny how ridiculous some of their &quot;evil&quot; plans were like in one episode the Robo&#039;s big evil plan was they were going to leave a restaurant without paying. However, as funny as they were, the Robos were also a great source of action seeing as how they use a different medabot against Ikki and Medabee each time they robattle. <br />
<br />
I know I refer to the Robos as one group, but they did have a bit of individuality to them: Sea Slug is the man-with-the-plan, Gill Girl is the token girl, Squid Guts is the strong dumb guy, and Shrimp Lips is the most evil and smartest one in the group who no one listens to. <br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
<br />
Each medabot looks unique and you&#039;ll never confuse one type of medabot for another. Furthermore, there&#039;s a fairly large variety of medabots including butterly-medabots, shark-medabots, samurai-medabots, spider-medabots, etc. <br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />
<br />
If you like anime like Pokemon or Digimon where kids and their monster friends have to save the world from some bad guys then you&#039;ll like Medabots. Personally, Medabots brought back feelings of nostalgia from when I watched this show on TV.
