[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br />
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />

[A Seriously Underrated Show]<br />
<br />
From the studio and creator that brought us Kemono Friends comes their latest show: Kemurikusa. This original show is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi that hooks the viewers with its slow revealing mysteries and excellent world-building, dynamic character interactions, wide set pieces, and great soundtracks. The 3DCG may take some adjustment and getting used to, but it’s not necessarily awful. In short, anybody that’s familiar with Tatsuki’s work should watch this anime.<br />
<br />
And also, did you know that Kemurikusa translates to “smoke grass”, “smoke plant”, or “smoke weed”. Yep, this is literally Winter 2019’s dankest anime. Thank you, Tatsuki.<br />
<br />
STORY: <br />
<br />
Synopsis: A trio of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304469">
        red-haired sisters, living in a post-apocalyptic world overwhelmed by a red fog, must fight against red robotic ‘bugs’, while searching for water and other resources. One day, the sisters find a large source of water and encountered a “human” named Wakaba; an encounter that would forever change their lives.<br />
<br />
For a show that has a short and simple synopsis, the story is more complex than that. There are many unanswered questions regarding our main characters and the world they live in. Some questions include: where do all the red bugs come from, what is a “Kemurikusa” leaf and what does it do, who is Wakaba, what happened to the world and how did the destruction occur, who is the first human, where did the blue walls come from, what are blacked out words in the memory leaf, etc. These question will not be answered in the first episode nor the second, but rather over many episodes. And the show does an amazing job at revealing these answers and truths.<br />
<br />
Each episode reveals a tiny bit about the world and its characters through dialogue, visual, and audio context. Some examples include: robotic ‘bugs’ come in various shapes and sizes and can be good or bad, Kemurikusa have many powers with multiple usage, the world is divided into several large islands, etc. There are also many different locations, such as abandoned office buildings, amusement parks, the “Sky Bridge”, villages, railway tracks and stations, etc, and they are stunning to look at; the world-building is well done and throughly explored. With the help of Wakaba’s curious nature, these areas, the nature of the Kemurikusa leaves, and several main characters are also explored. All of this combined makes Kemurikusa a very intriguing and engaging anime.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION/ART: <br />
<br />
Upon viewing the first episode it should be no surprise that this show uses 3D character models, which I believe is good, with CGI animations. Now, usage of 3DCG in anime has mostly gotten a bad reputation, mainly the art style could appear strange or the animations could be stiff and janky. <br />
<br />
This show, in my opinion, doesn’t have a bad or strange art style, in fact, its usage of lighting and color are amazing, for example, 1) a stale gray and black world is lightened up with bright colors of red and green with the occasional blue and yellow, and 2) when a character or bug ‘dies’ their body deteriorates into glowing leaves and drifts away. Both examples highlight how beautiful colors and lighting effects can have on a show. Now, the composition is fantastic; the use of abandoned villages and tall office buildings, ruin houses, decaying trees and vegetation, etc, are all framed and shot to provide a sense of desolation and passing of time. It’s haunting and intriguing.<br />
<br />
The show’s animations are sometimes smooth and fluid, and other times they are stiff and janky. The fight animations and choreography are okay and not very exciting, thankfully, they are brief and few in numbers. Also, there is the occasional still images that provide context for what is happening on screen. Overall, the animations and art are good.<br />
<br />
SOUND: <br />
<br />
The voice acting is hit-and-miss with Rin’s and Ritsu’s voices being the most standout and noteworthy, while Wakaba’s and Rina’s voices are too high pitched and somewhat annoying. Wakaba’s voice is most annoying when he’s saying his favorite catchphrases, such as “So Interesting!”, “Wow!”, or “I see!”, and when he’s being ‘too curious’ about everything that surrounds him. Rina’s voice, on the other hand, is just too high pitched and tries too hard to be the typical loli character. However these complaints are very minor and negligible after a few episodes.<br />
<br />
The sound design is pretty good. Its opening song titled &quot;KEMURIKUSA&quot; by nano features heavy drums, multiple guitars, a piano, and the singer rocking it out to our characters walking in various settings and fighting the red bugs. The ending song titled “INDETERMINATE UNIVERSE&quot; by Yuuyu is your standard J-Pop that features background images showing our characters connected to a red-string and when some characters die, they deteriorate into glowing leaves and drift away. The endings’ background images heavily implies whether our main characters are die or alive, this is a disturbing and interesting way to reveal answers. Both songs are great and well worth listening too. The background music is also pretty good as it sets the perfect mood and tension.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: <br />
<br />
The show heavily revolves around its central characters, i.e., Rin (tsundere), Rina (Loli), Ritsu (cat girl), and Wakaba (“human”), to drive the narrative and progress the story. Moreover, there are many moments of character interactions, which enhances the development of our characters. Along with our central characters, we have some secondary “characters”: Midori-chan (Kemurikusa tree), Ai-chan (Kemurikusa fish), Shiro (beeping Roomba bots), and the mysterious “dead” sisters (Ryo, Ryoku, and Riku). These secondary characters play a vital role in progressing the story and strengthening the development of our main characters.<br />
<br />
Our main male character, Wakaba, is unique in that he can sense and detect “warm spots” through the thick red fog. These warm spots can be anything  related to the red bugs, or red trunk and tree branches. He talks a lot in a high pitched voice and is very curious about everything that surrounds him. This is both good and bad. It’s good because we, the viewers, learn more about the world, the Kemurikusa powers, the red bugs, and who the characters are. In general just about everything. On other hand, it gets annoying and somewhat tiresome after awhile. Still, he’s nice, kind and willing to help the sisters whenever they need it.<br />
<br />
Our trio of red-haired heroines, namely Rin, Rina, and Ritsu, are sisters who are not normal humans, i.e., they drink copious amounts of water, they use Kemurikusa leaves for numerous activities throughout their lives, they jump and leap further than normal humans, and they emit a bright glow when fighting the red bugs. Rin is a self-determined, serious, and tough girl, who has a reverse ponytail and white scarf. Rina is a short, energetic, and exuberant girl, who has the ability to make multiple clones of herself, eats many types of metal, and wears maid clothing. Ritsu is a soft-spoken and caring girl, who always appears tired and has cat ears; she also controls a Kemurikusa tree named Midori-chan, and uses it to scout for enemies or for transportation.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
<br />
From its simplistic and short synopsis to its robotic and apocalyptic setting to its trio of red-haired heroines with masked background details. Everything seems to be shrouded in obscurity. But, like most series, not everything will be explained in the first or even second episode. It takes time. And this series is no different, it slowly and methodically reveal answers and truths over the course of the series. This coupled with its excellent world building hooks the viewers in wanting to learn more about the story and setting. Accompanying the setting and story is the good sound design, mainly its rocking opening and ending song. Additionally, while its art and animations, at times, appear janky, its composition and lighting are outstanding. The character interactions are frequent and provide many moments of character development, still some characters like Wakaba can be somewhat annoying. Overall, though, this series provides entertainment in the form of a slow-revealing mystery, great soundtracks, stunning compositions and lighting, and proper character development. A good series in my opinion.

<br />
Disclaimer: this review is not meant to be objective.<br />
<br />
Abstract (for those who don&#039;t want to read further): <br />
Kemurikusa is an anime that starts off empty and gradually makes the viewer sense emotions. At the beginning I felt like the characters lacked depth and life, but it all makes sense as the episodes go by. The story was definitely not developed on various important

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302089">
        points they wanted to connect and most of the tense situations or discoveries are set up very predictably. Nonetheless, I loved every aspect of it. The show carries a very ingénue air to it and opens up various psychological discussions on what personalities could emerge as as a new society rises. The characters always lack humanity but it somehow plays into the story line.<br />
<br />
As a concept:<br />
This an original piece of work. It is very often seen how anime adaptations are hyped up because their manga/light novel has great reviews, yet when the anime airs, it can feel butchered or -on the contrary- made greatly. With that said, one can tell that Kemurikusa is an anime meant to be displayed on a screen; not because of the 3-D artwork (which I&#039;ve just now learned to love), but because of the rawness of the development. Watching it, it almost felt like an indie production because it was free from preconceived notions. No review would be able to describe the structure of the story objectively, because it could very well be defined as: <br />
A) a genius, new perspective on isekai anime<br />
B) the messy execution of an apocalypse<br />
C) a thought-through story on a paradoxical cycle that has finally burst.<br />
D) an extreme commitment to mystery and philosophy.<br />
<br />
As a story:<br />
As hinted before, the plot is not over-analyzed nor unpredictable, but the premise of it never claimed to be. The very concept of an artist who has an idea and wants everyone to see is exactly what this has written all over it. The story doesn&#039;t have these vices that big production companies have, where they do something to polarize an audience, to please the fans,or try and make the viewer suspect something and then have it be the opposite. It works from the ground up. without context that can be fully deduced until the story allows you to piece by piece.

    It seems nobody has actually bothered in making a review.<br />
<br />
This, in very few words, is basically an Isekai anime, or that is what it seems to be so far, for the origin of certain characters is yet to be revealed.<br />
<br />
This anime is probably among the most underrated this season.  I have to admit the story and the art doesn&#039;t make it something for everyone to like, though; this anime is very criticized due to its... let&#039;s call it non-amazing CGI, after all (This anime uses 3D animation for its characters).<br />
<br />
Regarding the story and characters, I am not going to lie, they are kind of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301163">
        odd, but that&#039;s what makes this anime interesting to watch, and what makes you eager to watch the next episode to find out how it is going to develop. If I had to describe the story with one word, it would be Original.<br />
<br />
So, if you like stories that involve otherworldly contact, and you don&#039;t mind &quot;bad&quot; CGI, then give it a shot, you might actually like it.<br />
<br />
Note that this anime is not based off a Manga, Game/Visual Novel, or light novel.

    Kemurikusa is everything I like to see in an original anime production: it is a unique display of artistry which takes advantage of its visual medium to convey an engrossing story to the viewer. The plot is inherently a mystery, and after watching the first episode I had a dozen ideas of how it might play out. Halfway through the series I had enough clues from the dialogue and set pieces to put some parts together. In the end, nearly every thread of the story was tied together into a conclusion which answered every question I had and even some I didn&#039;t know I had.<br />
<br />
In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364103">
        my opinion the animation is a huge step up from Kemono Friends, Yaoyorozu&#039;s most prevalent previous work. There are still some moments where you&#039;ll notice cut corners, but this is the case for virtually every television anime series. For the most part the animation is fluid and effective. The character designs may look goofy at first but I quickly grew fond of them. The technical and creature designs are fascinating, with a combination of both familiar and alien elements. The titular Kemurikusa is visually striking and provides a strong over-arching motif which is drilled into your head throughout the series for reasons that become increasingly and alarmingly apparent. There is also a great deal of beauty in the environments, which often have hand-painted background art that plays nicely with the moving CG pieces.<br />
<br />
If you aren&#039;t bothered by the animation or characters, and you approach the series with an open heart and mind, then I wholeheartedly recommend sticking through Kemurikusa as it becomes increasingly endearing as the story progresses and characters develop. The only man I envy is he who has not yet watched Kemurikusa, because the emotional payoff in the end is immense.

    Director Tatsuki has been on a turbulent journey these past few years. He became a household name after the unparalleled success of Kemono Friends in 2017. Kemono Friends was a no name franchise from a failed mobile game and manga until the airing of the anime, which turned it into the industry giant it is today. That was largely thanks in part to the talent of Director Tatsuki. The man is a master of mystique and a world building wonder. He incorporates adorable characters into dark and sometimes even twisted stories, but in a meaningful and endearing way. <br />
<br />
After the success of Kemono Friends, we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308513">
        all thought the sky was the limit. But thanks to corporate greed, Tatsuki was kicked to the curb when they thought his usefulness had ended. Following this incident was a massive social media outcry from not only Japan, but around the world. Despite the hardship,Tatsuki and Studio Yaoyorozu picked themselves back up and went to work to tell another compelling story. This time, with an entire fandom in tow. <br />
<br />
Kemurikusa is a brand new series by Tatsuki and animated by Studio Yaoyorozu. It&#039;s set in a dystopian world following the sisters Rin, Ritsu, and Rina. I have to preemptively say, there are a large amount of similarities to the first season of Kemono Friends. Obviously because they both share the same director, but it&#039;s something worth pointing out. This time around the story is much darker and bleaker than Kemono Friends. The characters are constantly trying to survive as they attempt to find water and fight off Red Bugs. They come upon a mysterious person named Wakaba, who may very well help them find the paradise they&#039;ve longed for.<br />
<br />
The characters are the first thing I want to touch on. I found this cast of characters delightful and a joy to see them interact with one another. Tatsuki is incredibly good at making adorable, likable characters. They contrast very well with the dark, mysterious, and dystopian backdrop. And again, like Kemono Friends, the characters have a synergistic relationship with one another. The sisters have special powers and are able to fight the Red Bugs, while Wakaba is both intelligent and is able to think outside the box thanks in part to his insatiable curiosity. This relationship works so well because it allows everyone to be useful, and no one is left to irrelevancy. Rin is serious is always on the lookout for the enemy, Ristu is motherly and kind, Rina is goofy, innocent, and childlike, and finally Wakaba is easy going, sometimes air-headed, and easily frightened. It&#039;s a nice mix of personalities that you are quickly charmed by. Seeing these cute, endearing characters struggle in this twisted world only made you cheer for them more.<br />
<br />
Continuing on the story itself, it&#039;s a story of survival and trying to find a better life with the ones you love. The plot strings you along the entire time as there are numerous mysterious elements that keep you hooked. This is another aspect Tatsuki is very good at; his stories never lack mystique. How did the world get this way? Where did everyone go? What&#039;s the story behind the mysterious, yet powerful Kemurikusa leaves? Because of the survival element, tension was consistently present. The characters&#039; lives were constantly in danger as they walked into the unknown; be it from fighting off Red Bugs or running out of water. <br />
<br />
I did however, find myself bored a handful of times. At least one or two times an episode it&#039;s nothing but showing the characters walking and getting around difficult terrain. While it is interesting to see the world unfold in front of us, I just couldn&#039;t shake my feeling of boredom at times.<br />
<br />
There are a number of things that I don&#039;t feel as though they were explained well enough, which left me feeling a little disappointed. However, the entire story is contained in the 12 episodes. Which to me, is a breath of fresh air. There always seems to be room for a sequel nowadays, but this resolves the entire story from beginning to end which gives you a feeling of fulfillment and completeness.<br />
<br />
Visually, this was a big step up from Kemono Friends. Studio Yaoyorozu now has more experience, and it shows, but this may have also got more funding behind it as well. While it still retains the simple looking animation, the character designs are attractive and the animation is much smoother and more intricate. However, the animation still looks rough at times and at best it&#039;s only middle of the road, at least for industry standards. I think what helps set it apart is the art style, which is cute and round. It&#039;s basically becoming iconic at this point.<br />
<br />
As for backgrounds, it was filled with crumbling buildings and structures, empty cars filling some streets while others are completely barren. You&#039;ll see a variety of structures like an amusement park, a residential district, an industrial district and more. What happened to what appears to be this once great society? Tatsuki uses this to his advantage as a &quot;show, don&#039;t tell&quot; technique that he did so well in Kemono Friends.<br />
<br />
The music wasn&#039;t anything to write home about. It served it&#039;s purpose as I don&#039;t have anything particularly positive or negative to say about it. And from what I can tell of the voice acting, it was great. Everyone had a distinct and innocent sound to them that I just loved.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been a long road for Tatsuki since the end of Kemono Friends. But I can happily say he has another winner on his hands. At the time of this review, volume 1 of Kemurikusa has sold 15,000 units. Kemurikusa is an interesting world with a great cast of characters. The story leaves you with a sense of satisfaction and is an overall enjoyable experience. While it does lag behind in couple of key aspects, Kemurikusa is still a memorable show that I found myself loving by the time episode 12 rolled around. <br />
<br />
After the way he was treated, it&#039;s terrific to see a director like Tatsuki land back on his feet with Kemurikusa. His blending of cute and dark along with a twist of mystery, Tatsuki has found a successful formula that works, and I can&#039;t wait to see what he has in store for the future.

    Kemurikusa is a perfect example of two things: how an anime can be more than the sum of its parts and what does an anime with a bento&#039;s worth of budget behind it look like.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a TLDR at the end, dw.<br />
<br />
Art: Let&#039;s get this straight immediately: this is by far (I mean it) the worst looking anime I&#039;ve ever had the displeasure to watch. It looks more like Foodfight than an actual anime, the characters look awful, the animation is frankly appalling, to put it mildly. It looks like a high school student project more so than anything else, I cannot find a single redeeming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307322">
        factor artistically, other than a random &quot;oh that looks cute&quot; which isn&#039;t exactly a high wall to climb.<br />
It is at its best when everyone is still and talking as little as possible, while the action scenes are pure unadultered junk, they&#039;re so bad you&#039;ll start to wonder if you&#039;re watching a parody rather than a show taking itself seriously.<br />
<br />
Sound: It doesn&#039;t help that the voice acting direction is dreadful, too, and that almost all voice actors range from ear-bleeding bad to just mediocre. I&#039;m extremely thankful that Mikako Komatsu is Rin&#039;s voice as she&#039;s the only one that didn&#039;t immediately annoy me while talking. In fact, I don&#039;t know how her agent blackmailed her into voice acting for this series but I&#039;m glad he did. She&#039;s by far the only one that can bring her wax-looking character to life and the only one that is actually able to convey different emotions (imagine that) rather than droning on in the same tone, whatever happens.<br />
I found Wakaba&#039;s (the guy) seiyuu to be particularly irritating, the only emotion that you&#039;ll get out of him is mild surprise or childish interest for something. Whether he&#039;s eating, walking or someone&#039;s dying, the tone of his voice is always the bloody same.<br />
Sound design and mixing is frankly poor too, things you&#039;d expect to make LOUD sounds don&#039;t have any at all, you&#039;d think it was a glitch of some sort. Rin in the last episode gets an arm and a leg cut off (don&#039;t worry, they&#039;ll grow back 20 seconds later) and you&#039;ll be wondering how did that happen since there was NO sound at all that even remotely suggested it. <br />
Music is ok but nothing exciting at all.<br />
<br />
Characters: oh boy. If you want an assortment of archetypes you&#039;ll get them here.<br />
Tsundere? Check.<br />
Nyan-girl? Check.<br />
Lolis with blackboard-scratching high pitched voices? Check.<br />
Cute robot sidekick? Check.<br />
Stupid boy with a heart of gold? Check.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s uncanny. If I&#039;m honest though, I didn&#039;t find the characters all that offensive. There&#039;s nothing new or surprising about them at all but they don&#039;t milk their archetype to death like you&#039;d expect from an anime of this kind.<br />
You&#039;d expect me to write more about them but there really isn&#039;t more to it than that. They&#039;re not developed much if at all and even when they are, there isn&#039;t anything eye-opening, rather just confirmations of behaviours that were already apparent. <br />
<br />
Story: This is the only part of the anime that I&#039;d give a pass to. We&#039;re in this world where there is basically one enemy, a red fog that takes control of robots (called mushi, although I preferred the ones from mushishi) which then proceed to kill any living thing. Kemurikusa, these different-looking (and different-acting) leaves, are pretty much the hearts of almost all characters, who are obviously trying to survive and then, logically, destroy whatever is causing this red fog to occur. In this journey (well, right at the end of it) there&#039;ll be also a clear explanation for pretty much everything that lead to this situation (granted, there&#039;s a lot of painstaking stupidity in those explanations but whatever). The concept of kemurikusa is not one that I&#039;d heard of or read about before watching this show so it was nice and interesting. It would have been far more interesting if it had been explored more but that would have meant more episodes and my eyes and ears can only take so much. The very end is extremely convenient, blandly clichée-d and phoned in but again, for this kind of anime I wasn&#039;t expecting anything more so I&#039;m fairly happy with it. Be aware that there are A TON of huge plotholes in it so don&#039;t stop asking &quot;wait what&quot; or &quot;wait why&quot;, just take it in stride and move on.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I know I pretty much panned this show to hell and back and I do stand behind everything I said. Still, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit, although I can&#039;t really point at a single reason why. Kemurikusa won&#039;t waste your time, won&#039;t drag its feet and it doesn&#039;t try to do things that it knows it won&#039;t be able to pull off (well, most of the time anyway). It&#039;s a nice journey and one that has a very obvious ending but thanks to its relative brevity, it&#039;s a journey that can be worth undertaking, if this anime resonates with you.<br />
<br />
TLDR: watch the first 2 episodes, if you can stand the art and the characters, it&#039;s all uphill from there. If you can&#039;t, you&#039;re not losing out on anything special at all.

    Kemurikusa is a mysterious sci-fi anime about a group of sisters, each with their own superpowers, that have to survive in a post apocalyptic world full of ominous red fog and &quot;bugs&quot; which attack them. They stumble upon a mysterious person named Wakaba who can&#039;t explain how they ended up there.<br />
<br />
The story is well executed and well written. It keeps the viewer interested: Why is the world destroyed? Where did all the humans go? And so-on. Yaoyorozu has a fetish for post-apocalyptic styled settings as evidenced by their work on Kemono Friends prior to this anime. They do a really good job on making their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311744">
        worlds have that ominous sense that something isn&#039;t quite right.<br />
<br />
The characters are interesting and also well written. Yaoyorozu really knows how to make their characters charming and cute.<br />
<br />
The CGI in this anime is similar in style to Kemono Friends so if you&#039;re upset by that sort of thing then you might not like it. I thought it was decent. The SFX and voiceacting are fine, nothing crazy but nothing awful.<br />
<br />
(Small spoiler alert)<br />
<br />
My complaints with this anime are mainly with regards to the plot. The writers never really explain to the viewer at any point how Wakaba just suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The anime also never really explains to the viewer why the characters are all inside of a ship landed on a planet. Is it crashlanded there? There are some questions the viewer might have about characters that never get answered as well: If Wakaba isn&#039;t human, what is he? I suppose they might leave this unanswered to create a sense of mystery but I think there are some things that shouldn&#039;t be left unanswered in an anime like this that&#039;s only meant to be a single season long.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kemurikusa is a well written, mysterious sci-fi story told brilliantly. The setting, plot and character design are all top-notch. I think it certainly deserves a 9 out of 10 and I am eager to see what new projects Yaoyorozu has in store.<br />
<br />

    Seems like most people didn&#039;t like the anime, but for me this anime is incredible.<br />
<br />
The most noticiable thing you&#039;ll see is surely the CG animation. I thought it was bad at first, but now I see how it works better than 2D. The CG looks really beautiful with the backgrounds, and I started liking it. Even though its good, it could be better. What I like the most in the art style are the colors, the shining colors make an gorgeous contrast with the black and gray backgrounds.<br />
<br />
&lt;SPOILER ALERT&gt; I can&#039;t say anything sure about the story now. Yes, the story is doing just ok

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302586">
        right now, nothing really special. But with all of the post-apocalyptic theme, the appearence of that girl I forget the name who everyone thought was dead, the blue insects, that things written in Wakaba&#039;s kemurikusa... I can see some big things happening with the story. &lt;SPOILER END&gt;<br />
<br />
The characters are good and their development is really great. I don&#039;t have much to say about it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the idea and style of this anime are really unique. It makes me wanna know what will happen the next episode, its fun to watch... &lt;SPOILER&gt; made me feel kinda sad for the robots in episode 8, &lt;SPOILER END&gt; and makes me curious to know what happened and is happening at that world. The strongest point and what made me start watching the show was the art style, the colors are used in such a beautiful way... Its not perfect, some people may not like its style very much, but its a really great anime.

    The premise is amazing. Like Made in Abyss, there&#039;s no way to guess what the characters will see next because the world is so unique.<br />
<br />
Story&#039;s good, though it&#039;s a basic quest.<br />
<br />
The art&#039;s pretty bad. The character designs are cute, but the CGI animation is very low quality.<br />
<br />
Sound is okay. Good voice acting, okay sound effects, okay music.<br />
<br />
Characters are very trope-y and some of them are a bit annoying in that they are too cutesy. The main character is a paradox. On the one hand, he has all the beta male behaviors and affectations and appears to be a complete and utter wuss, but by his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304519">
        words and actions, he is bafflingly courageous and noble. Even one of the other characters notes this in dialog.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the series and watched it all the way to the end. I give it an 8/10.

    SPOILER ALERT if you haven&#039;t watched the show yet read at your own risk <br />
<br />
Alright gentlemen fasten your seat belts for we are going to delve into the big failure that this show has fallen into<br />
 from what this show could offer, it is nothing compared to what it did <br />
the story takes place in an apocalyptic world at the end of civilization <br />
among all the wreck and collapsed buildings it revolves around a group of girls (it is implied that they are not human which i&#039;ll get into in the characters section)  who happen to fight Unknown entities so called &quot;Bugs&quot;/&quot;Mushi&quot; in order

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301177">
        to survive this cruel environment, they also have to find water which they consume dozens of &#039;cuz y&#039;know &quot;Life needs water&quot;. the souls of those girls in the story are represented by leaves, which wither by time if they don&#039;t get water.<br />
with this being the premise is actually pretty good in fact I was hooked when I read the synopsis.<br />
<br />
now we get into what I hated the most about this show, the characters <br />
it doesn&#039;t have a lot but they&#039;re all obnoxious and feel awkward especially the Main character &quot;Wakaba&quot; an annoying human brat which the fact of him having curiosity about everything is forcefully ingrained everywhere in the show in contrast to the other girls (who like I said are not human) this also implies that curiosity is the main core in evolution because the girls are incapable of being curious thus not going any further. This show cherry-picks what it thinks is &quot;Good&quot; for the audience <br />
because you have the catgirl, the loli(s), the tsundere and lastly the delinquent <br />
it tried to mesh fetish and &quot;the dark elements&quot; in it making it more awkward and ironic, there&#039;s also the &quot;Love&quot; element which just like I said is hand-picked for the audience, I mean heck why are they capable of Love (they call it poison lmao) and friendship or &quot;Liking stuff&quot;, and not capable of being curious or having the sense of adventure, are they being more human as they interact more with wakaba? Probably not. <br />
<br />
the art is amazing and some shots look cool but it&#039;s screwed up by the cgi <br />
because everyone knows, when you&#039;re going to have a show with fighting scenes <br />
the cgi (if is poorly executed/done) only makes it worse.<br />
I don&#039;t have much to say about the voice acting as it fits the annoying characters of wakaba and the rinas (seriously rinas&#039; is earrape )<br />
<br />
At last I couldn&#039;t enjoy this show and I dropped it because of all the reasons mentioned above, I forgot to mention that this show is taking the drift of becoming an Isekai-harem show so Yeah...<br />
If I had one thing to praise about this show it would be its opening song honestly  <br />
I downloaded it just so that I can headbang to it.<br />
<br />
<br />

    This is my second review that I am writing. This time it&#039;s about Kemurikusa.<br />
<br />
To start with, Kemurikusa is a 12 episode original full-CGI anime done by Studio Yaoyorozu who previously did the very successful Kemono Friends, and which has been their only well-known show. Since the show is done in CGI this will instantly put off some people.<br />
<br />
Story: Since I only saw the first 4 episodes my take on the story is not complete so bear with me, I might be taking thinga wrong or certain things might improve later on in the show. The story so far is about a group of girls living

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302469">
        in a what seems to be dystopian world that is partly covered with red fog. The girls themselves have certain abilities that they achieve through glowing transparent leaves. The world they live in is also inhabited by red mechanical-looking creatures called Mushi who are (so far) always hostile. In the midst of one of the girl&#039;s expeditions they meet a guy who mysteriously appears out of nowhere.<br />
That&#039;s the story so far. While watching I was actually counting on the plot and believing it would get stronger and deeper later on. It seemed promising. However, 4 episodes in the story hasn&#039;t progressed in any actually interesting direction and has been stagnant in excitement since the start.<br />
<br />
Art: I&#039;m gonna be quick and ruthless here. This is not Land of the Lustrous. But it is also not Dimension High School (from this season) or Berserk 16/17. That being said, the CGI is not very good but it is not the worst. CGI in anime is still a problem child and most full-CGI anime struggle in that regard. Apart from the CGI there is no notable aspect for art.<br />
<br />
Sound: If there was background sound I forgot it already. I guess the sound is....there. But that should be obvious. So no praise here.<br />
The opening is good and done by the talented Nona, who somehow lately always does openings for &quot;not so good shows&quot;. The ed is forgettable, I already forgot it.<br />
<br />
Characters: Oh boy, let&#039;s go. To start with, I forgot all their names but that won&#039;t do any bad. The characters are....boring. They don&#039;t give you that feeling when you watch characters who actually have character, apart from sprinkled stereotypes. Since I can&#039;t give a lot of spoilers, let&#039;s just say that the female main lead quickly falls into a well-known and old pattern, and it&#039;s not good. However, the single worst and actually bad character is the guy who appears out of nowhere. His character personality is somehow infuriating. He acts very &quot;knowledge-hungry&quot; but in an annoying way. The way he acts and articulates makes you not like the character at all. I understand that everything is new to him but can he..like just calm down. I&#039;m not exaggerating when I say that he is the sibgle thing that made be not wanting to watch the show, which eventually was the case.<br />
I dropped the show after episode 4.<br />
<br />
My verdict is a 5/10. While the guy is a terrible character I have to give the show credit for trying to go the mystery route, but you gotta give the viewers the mystery, instead of holding it back and just leave the room empty. Do I recommend this anime? No, I don&#039;t.<br />
Even if the show in the end ends up being a great mystery show, not catching me in the first 4 episodes is a bad sign and I do have things I rather do than watching Kemurikusa. If you have enough time to watch this show, go ahead. You might even get a good finale. But if your time is precious to you or you don&#039;t want to miss anything good, I can assure you. You won&#039;t miss out on anything great.<br />
And that&#039;s it for my review, I hope everything was made clear what I wanted to say and I see you in the next review.

    WARNING - THE SECOND HALF OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. I have included a warning in the text itself, so you&#039;ll know where to stop reading if necessary.<br />
<br />
For those who haven’t seen Kemurikusa yet, I&#039;d say: if you like this show&#039;s premise, then go for it, it&#039;s a harmless watch. Following the characters on their adventure is somewhat enjoyable, and the worldbuilding is intriguing. The ending - my least favourite part - isn&#039;t offensively bad either. I actually feel bad for giving this little show a 5, since it does have a lot of heart. It almost feels like some kind of indie project from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328886">
        a small, unknown creator. So I need to get my problems with it off my chest. <br />
<br />
Playing into the indie feel, is the low budget – immediately one of its problems, sadly. This is especially evident by the CGI, used to animate every single movement in the anime. The animation of the Mushi (&#039;bugs&#039;) still looks passable, but the character designs are just off, and that&#039;s hard to ignore in the beginning. The expressions of characters show zero emotion and their movements look incredibly awkward. An overload of stills also makes watching this anime quite a static experience. Luckily, there&#039;s still something I can compliment the art section on. The usage of moody colours in the background art is very effective, and helps conveying the post-apocalyptic setting.<br />
<br />
Many points of critique I have centre around the characters. I bear no heavy dislike towards any of them, but I&#039;m afraid they didn’t contribute much to me. Wakaba, for example, is filled with childish wonder about Kemurikusa and the world that surrounds him. It&#039;s nice that we have a character sharing our curiosity about the universe built in the show, but too much of his dialogue consists of him saying things like &quot;How interesting!&quot;, and him being overly hype so often makes it seem like he barely takes things seriously – in heavy contrast to when he’s suddenly surprised at the dangers of the situation, even though those should already be known to him. The Rinas exhibit a similar air of carefreeness, as they mainly seem to care about being able to eat new things. And I feel the need to note that I’m not talking about normal food here. Oh well, at least their iron uptake won’t running low anytime soon… But that aside, these characters serve for a lot of retread comedy and dialogue, and it isn’t especially entertaining. <br />
<br />
The more serious characters aren’t outstanding either, but they mostly serve their purpose. Ritsu is a meek but kind-hearted girl, who cares deeply for her sisters and Midori-chan, her Kemurikusa tree. Then we have Rin, a turbulent but strong-willed girl doing everything in her power to protect her sisters from the world’s dangers. The dilemmas she faces in this endeavour are easy to relate to, and make her the most intricate character of the bunch. Sadly, there’s still something about her that annoyed me. She’s in love with Wakaba, and that receives quite a bit of focus, but there’s never any actual romantic development. The interactions between Rin and Wakaba are all too often rehashes of earlier dialogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD. If you haven’t seen the show yet, this is where you should turn away.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are still three other sisters: Riku, Ryoku, and Ryo. All of them are pretty fun characters, but I won’t focus on their personalities, since they don’t get a lot of screentime. More importantly, those sisters are thought to be dead by Rin &amp; co. It turns out that this is not fully accurate, as they somehow ended up merging into one Kemurikusa after dying. The thing is, these three girls all came to their end at different times and in different places, and it’s never explained how this Kemurikusa was able to revive each of them. And that’s not the only problem. When Wakaba encounters Riku, he is told to keep her still being alive a secret, but no single reason as to why this would be necessary is given.<br />
<br />
Building further on my point about Kemurikusa, I unfortunately have to say that the conclusion poses problems yet again. The range of abilities among Kemurikusa is seemingly infinite, and the show uses that as an excuse to just do whatever the fuck it wants with them. The keystone in the whole story is the ‘First Person’, a little girl, and in the end it’s revealed that she split herself up in a Memory Leaf and six people – the sisters. Maybe I’m thinking about this too seriously, but I just don’t get how these Kemurikusa can create six people with widely varying personalities and abilities out of one person. To elaborate on Rin’s feelings for Wakaba, it’s a safe bet to say that Rin received those in the process of the First Person splitting herself up, and some of the other sisters seem to be aware of this, as they make fun of Rin for not understanding her own feelings. Thing is, this information should be locked up in the Memory Leaf, so the only conclusion I can draw is that the other sisters are somehow clairvoyant. <br />
<br />
And the single biggest issue I have with this thing is the trigger for the whole story. Combining a few colours of Kemurikusa apparently enables the First Person to make the strongest one ever, and apart from destroying the other Kemurikusa as intended… it destroys most of the world. Additionally, all the Mushi the group encounters during their adventure were spawned by this one Kemurikusa. This comes off as a giant asspull, since there’s barely any explanation as to why this Kemurikusa she created would be so powerful.<br />
<br />
One might beg the question: what did she seek to accomplish with her actions? You see, Wakaba was a scientist occupied with extensive projects involving Kemurikusa, which means little of his time could be spent together with the First Person, who cared about him deeply. The reasoning behind her decision, as stated by the anime, is that she wanted to relieve Wakaba of his high workload. However, it should have been obvious to her that Wakaba was actually very passionate about his job. What this signifies to me is that the loneliness she felt during Wakaba&#039;s absence is what actually drove her. The problem I have with this, is that we&#039;re given no reason as to why she would be so attached to Wakaba. Their relationship isn&#039;t fleshed out at all. And Wakaba himself? He immediately forgives her, and tries to cheer her up, since she did it for him. I’m not asking for him to full-on scold her, since that would be out of character, but he doesn&#039;t even show a hint of remorse. It&#039;s weird, to say the least. To summarize, the entire world ends up being destroyed because of the love of one little girl for someone else. This may sound cool to some, but how the anime goes about shaping up to this event makes it fall flat on its face.

    &quot;Kemurikusa&quot; is a fascinating show.The first few episodes had me almost looking away.Firstly,the CGI was off-putting.Then you had this character who was annoying as hell,constantly drooling at any &amp; everything with pretty much the same few words.However,once the plot picked up I wasn&#039;t able to stop.It seems a strange decision on the part of the makers to backload all the great/good parts.The starting is rather dry &amp; there is not even a hint of the escalation that the second half will bring.I am sure many people would&#039;ve left the anime before reaching this tipping point.<br />
<br />
There are essentially 4 characters in all.There is Ritsu,Rin,the quadruplets &amp;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327433">
        Wakaba.The relationship that the sisters share is one of the highlights of the show.Their love runs deep &amp; they look after each other quiet selflessly.The world works on many levels.It conveys a sense of abandon with the backdrop of forsaken,dilapidated structures.The &#039;fog&#039; adds to this uncertain world.The other details are quiet creative too.All the sisters have unique abilities.They fight for survival everyday.And all they need is water.The plot has an inherent mystery that we unravel along with Wakaba.There is also a rather unpredictable backstory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kemurikusa&quot; is a work on the theme of love &amp; how it can transcend death/rebirth itself.I felt the show could&#039;ve been more complex.It had all the ingredients.It ended up teasing greatness,to end at &#039;good&#039;.You can definitely give it a try.It&#039;s rather under-rated.

    Don&#039;t let the CGI fool you. Kemurikusa is an exceptional anime despite its appearance.<br />
<br />
The story is really quite written well. It is quite similar to Kemono Friends, except we see and get more of the world explained, which I liked. If you haven&#039;t watched Kemono Friends, then to TL;DR Kemurikusa and this one: people go explore an apocalyptic landscape.<br />
<br />
So, I give Story 10/10.<br />
<br />
As for art: I gave it a 6/10 because I docked points for the bad animation, but the imagery and backgrounds were really good. So that kept it afloat.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10 I didn&#039;t think much was memorable personally.<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10 - it turns out the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308960">
        &quot;personalities&quot; that each one had had a purpose (the details will be revealed when you watch). But I felt there was not much development on their front.<br />

    It started off kinda slow, and it took an episode for me to get used to the different art style, aka &quot;bad CG&quot;.  But the world made me curious so I decided to keep watching. The longer I watched the more curious I become. Who are these people? Who made them?what happened to the world? <br />
To me, this anime has a similar feel as Girls&#039; Last Tour.  Both exploring a post apocalyptic world. They experiment with what they find, but for the most part, they are so focused on surviving that they don&#039;t wonder too much about the world around them. Girls&#039; Last

        Tour had better art and characters, but it was a slice of life. Kemurikusa has a lot more action and danger.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
Art: 6 (CGI was kinda bad, but I got used to it after the first episode. Otherwise, there are some amazing scenes in the anime.)<br />
Sound: 9 (used well to create a mysterious and oppressing atmosphere)<br />
Character: 7 (some are a little plain, but I&#039;m not sure they are actually human anyways)<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
I rated my enjoyment as a 9/10, but I kinda have a thing for exploring abandoned buildings and stuff. The mystery and wonder of how things work, but also the nostalgia and sadness when I think about how millions of people used to live there and they all put so much into building it up, but now its all abandoned and falling apart. The people going through now don&#039;t even know how to use the simple tools and technology that was left behind.<br />
It probably only deserves a 7/10 though. Most people were probably turned off by the slow first episode and the CGI. Honestly, some anime fans treat CGI the same way &quot;normies&quot; who only watch live action, treat all anime.

    Kemurikusa is a pretty unique anime, with a totally original setting that draws you into it immediately. <br />
<br />
The art has amazing direction and use of colors, good character designs, and some very interesting uses of 3D. That  being said, there is no denying that at a technical level, there are allot of rough edges and noticeable mistakes that aren&#039;t very charming, and can even distract from what is actually being presented at times.<br />
<br />
The sound is serviceable to good, and the OP is pretty hype.<br />
<br />
There is an interesting cast of characters that are all pretty likable from the start, thought the main character himself is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324885">
        a little weak for most of the run time. <br />
<br />
If you can get over the visual shortcomings, you will find a story that is hard to put down, and setting with huge possibilities to get your brain turning.
