    As someone who has yet to see Unicorn Gundam, I was worried that my enjoyment of Gundam NT would be hampered. To my surprise, however, the quality of the film is irrelevant to whoever has watched Unicorn Gundam or even has seen a previous Gundam series at all. Gundam Narrative is just bad. Whether the person watching it is a die-hard UC fan or a newcomer to the franchise, the movie is terrible on its own merit.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
<br />
Here is Gundam NT&#039;s biggest flaw: its paper thin and boring story. The story, at least, does a decent job of explaining the events that happened previously which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302097">
        are relevant and important to the events of NT, meaning that people who missed out on Unicorn won&#039;t be completely lost. The big issue here, however, is just how uninteresting. The film just drags on and on with this philosophical nonsense about how humans should not be tampering with the power of gods or the corruption of the Federation in testing on children. It doesn&#039;t do anything profound to portray these themes, and the characters just talk about these issues in rather bland dialogue.<br />
<br />
Another issue to note with the story is how detached it feels to the viewer. It attempts to portray violence or traumatic events in such a way that the person watching the movie will feel shock or empathy, but it fails at this task. The movie shows these events, but fails to show to a significant extent how the effects of such horrors. The beginning of the film, for example, shows the destruction caused by Operation British, in which a colony was dropped on Earth, in the original Gundam, but it is presented like something out of a Hollywood film. It lacks any sort of nuance or emotional attachment. <br />
<br />
Art:7/10<br />
<br />
Considering that this is Sunrise, it is to nobody&#039;s surprise that Gundam NT&#039;s animation is absolutely spectacular. It&#039;s fluid and detailed. The mecha action is well animated and fun to watch. My biggest gripe, however, concerns character design and mecha design. On the topic of character design, Zoltan&#039;s design just looks ridiculous. He has such an over the top and blatantly evil look as if he were pulled out of a Saturday morning cartoon. His one red eye is just cheesy and unnecessary. On the topic of mecha design, it was pretty disappointing. Considering the story only takes place one year after the events of Gundam Unicorn, I wasn&#039;t expecting a huge departure from that series&#039; designs, but I expected more than what we got. The Gundam Narrative&#039;s design, the Narrative is what this film&#039;s lead Gundam is called by the way, looks generic and uninspired, as if the designers simply slapped elements from previous Gundam designs together and just called it a day. <br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
<br />
The English dub I honestly have no complaints over. It&#039;s well acted and gets the job done. My biggest gripe, however, is the music. Having heard tracks from Unicorn Gundam and his work in other shows such as Kill la Kill I expected something decent at least. I will admit that I am not the biggest Sawano fan, but I just couldn&#039;t bring myself to like any of the tracks he made. The vocal songs were just generic pop songs and failed to induce any excitement in the scenes they were present. The instrumental songs were insignificant, and I honestly can&#039;t think of a single track that I enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
<br />
Here is Gundam NT&#039;s other greatest flaw: it&#039;s characters. I honestly couldn&#039;t believe just how annoying and uninteresting the characters were. For starters, Jona Basta is a terrible lead. He fails to show any character development or growth throughout the movie and simply mopes his way through the film&#039;s duration. He has no outstanding qualities or anything that makes the viewer care for him. The film does nothing to ensure the viewer actually becomes invested in Jona&#039;s character or his struggles because of how lackluster he is.<br />
<br />
Another character that requires special mention is the main villain, Zoltan. Zoltan is a terrible villain because, like Jona, he has absolutely zero unique qualities or anything that makes him unique. The writers fail to give Zoltan any depth, for there is literally nothing about him that we learn. We learn nothing about his past, motivations, or struggles. His only purpose in the story is to serve as some sort of arbitrary villain for the main characters to fight in some sort of grand finale. He&#039;s just some crazed guy who only seeks to fight for no reason whatsoever. The only character in the entire story which shows some sort of growth or development is Michele Luio, but even that is hardly anything to talk about.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
<br />
The fight scenes, though fun to watch, were still boring in that I had no emotional investment in them. It was like I was watching some guy clash two toys together. Why should I care about these characters possibly dying if I have no reason to? Why should I be watching this when I could be watching something else? There were times were I was legitimately tempted to walk out of the theater simply because of how bored I was with it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
<br />
The creators of this film state that this will be the start of another chapter for the Universal Century, which has me worried for future entries. Just read the summary online if you really want to be caught up with the lore. It&#039;s a waste of your time.

    I just watched earlier &amp; being my 1st review i hope it does help in a way to those who wanted to catch up with it in the near future. WARNING LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />
<br />
Mobile Suit Gundam NT Review:<br />
Story: This adaptation is based off the Unicorn lightnovel which initially was completed but due to the popularity of the series, was inserted late into the whole Gundam UC Timeline. All i say is that you need knowledge prior to watching this (or better yet watch the whole UC animes) if not you will not know what is happening. They don&#039;t even throw a bone. So its hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298121">
        to watch this as a standalone movie. Sideline-wise, at least i am glad they didn&#039;t discard the original ZZ timeline &amp; abandon the Zeta movie ending instead. Also too many backtracking to the past then to the present, but diehard fans will appreciate all these easter egg nuggets (hence why i mention that watching the previous UC series since the beginning of OYW is a bonus). They also touch on the neverending topic of being a Newtype/ Cyber Newtypes &amp; how society deemed them. For me as a hardcore Gundam fans, i give this movie a 7.<br />
Story 7/10<br />
<br />
Art: Same as Gundam UC movies/Series, the art is great with not much of complaints. Of course since this is a big budget movie, the art is reminicing of the older Gundam movies. I gave this a 9.<br />
Art 9/10<br />
<br />
Sound: As Sawano Hiroyuki is part of the team again (who doesn&#039;t listen to Gundam UC soundtracks &amp; screams epic!), the soundtrack is superb &amp; there is some hints of familliar to UC. No complaints here, i gave this a 9.<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
<br />
Character: Again the way how this is being portrayed, going back &amp; forth with storyline-wise, it&#039;s rather hard to like the new characters. Their motives, resolve.... Its difficult to vote them at all. Too messy i can say. Still the saving grace is that there are cameos round so... I can only give a 7<br />
Character 7/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: like i said if you are not a diehard fans, it is difficult to enjoy this as a standalone movie without prior knowledge. But since i am a hardcore Gundam fan, i do enjoy watching it, with all the references as well as the action scenes. There&#039;s even one part which i was caught surprised with. The only complaint that i got is that it does seems to be abit messy with the storyline. Overall i gave this a 7<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
Overall: Again to highlight, for those who have yet to watch a single UC series, i will advice that it is difficult to understand the whole plotline. For those like me, you will enjoy the ride. As a bonus, it would be advise to know Mobile Suit Gundam UC: One of Seventy Two (a short movie that was shown at G-Dome which unfortunately had not been screen outside Japan) plotline before watching this. I gave this a 7<br />
Overall: 7

    Mobile Suit Gundam NT Review<br />
<br />
Story (5/10) Mediocre<br />
More Specifically (5.75/10) Good<br />
<br />
The story for Mobile Suit Gundam NT was mediocre, it follows a tri-protagonist story about three children known as the miracle children that were known to predict an upcoming catastrophic event that happened during the time 0079. This causes the future of these three children to be used and manipulated for the ravages of war between the Earth Federation and Neo Zeon. I thought the overall execution was good but this movie definitely requires a hefty knowledge of at least Gundam 0079, Gundam 0087 Zeta, Gundam 0093 Char&#039;s Counter Attack and Gundam 0096 Unicorn. For a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302033">
        heavy Gundam fan this is fine but for everyone else that is indeed asking a bit much as this movie will constantly flashback to scenes of the series or movies that I mentioned. So if you have no knowledge of them the call backs will indeed fly right over your head clean. It&#039;s indeed a double-edge sword but seeing as this was only in theaters for 1 day, Sunrise assumed only hardcore Gundam fans would be there for this so it is what it is. Nonetheless I thought it was wasn&#039;t anything worth complimenting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+ <br />
<br />
The art style I felt for this move was very good and so was the animation. Although the mech fights were cool at times it would get so chaotic sometimes, you could easily loose track of what&#039;s going on. So it can get high maintenance to keep track of everything when the going gets tough. The CG animation on the Phenex Gundam wasn&#039;t as bad as I thought it would be but it is a tinsy bit weird to see everything else hand drawn while the Phenex is in full CG and sometimes it&#039;ll go handdrawn itself so the consistency between that, I would surprise if it bothered people. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10)<br />
More Specifically (9.50/10) Great<br />
<br />
The sound in the movie was the best thing about it, the background music ost of VigilaNTe made every scene it played it two times better to me, I watched it in English dub and I thought every voice actor did a great job, nothing outstanding but definitely nothing big enough to complain about to any degree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (6/10) Good {Minor Spoilers}<br />
 <br />
<br />
Like I said in the story section this movie is a tri-protagonist movie, which was a new different take for a Gundam. At first I didn&#039;t really have an issue with the three but after a bit of hindsight, Jona Basta didn&#039;t really showcase any good characterization to really care commend. He wasn&#039;t a bad character but he definitely wasn&#039;t anything to compliment, we was just there continuously talking about his mission where you could see his character wasn&#039;t right in the head for basically the entire movie (and also his piloting skills weren&#039;t all that either). Rita is a bit more interesting as she was positive with hopes and dreams 24/7 but you know where that usually leads you in a Gundam series, nonetheless I thought the little dialogue she did have was interesting enough to say she was a good enough character. Michele is the one that surprisingly gets the most characterization and character development of the three as her actions causes her to go down many different paths through the movie one of jealously one, one of self discovery for both herself and humanity and lastly one of redemption, she may be the least likable but from a character standpoint I would definitely say she&#039;s got the most depth to her. That antagonist of this movie I felt could have been handled a bit better as his backstory and reasoning behind doing what he does wasn&#039;t really explained as well as it should have been in my opinion, it was hard for me to care for anything he did. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good<br />
<br />
As I watched the movie, all I wanted to see was some good ole Gundam action, but I also did get a decent enough story and characters. The many call backs I appreciated and the return of &quot;you know who&quot; at the end of the movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (7/10) Good<br />
More Specifically (7.60/10) Good+<br />
<br />
Overall the movie wasn&#039;t very good but I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s bad either. I thought it was enjoyable for the most part and that&#039;s mostly probably because i watched it on the big screen.  <br />
<br />
Can&#039;t wait for Hathaway&#039;s Flash!

    “In my next life, I hope I get to be a bird!”<br />
<br />
The Universal Century, the main timeline of Gundam. For years it’s always been a huge point of love for Gundam fans. Since it’s creation, the Universal Century has been revived with the likes of Gundam Unicorn and it’s somewhat confusing Laplace Box shenanigans. However even with Unicorn’s problems, it showed that the heart of original UC remains in the creators of Sunrise, and this film represents that well once again. <br />
<br />
I’ll begin this review with a few questions. First off, do you love the original 4 Universal Century entries? Ignore the side stories, OVAs,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309330">
        everything. Focus on the original shows and film. Do you love the original Mobile Suit Gundam? Do you love Zeta Gundam? Do you love ZZ Gundam and Char’s Counterattack? If you do, if you really do, then you should probably watch this movie. <br />
<br />
Did you think Unicorn was “neat but not amazing” but still enjoyed all the callbacks to UC? If you do, watch this movie.<br />
<br />
Are you curious on what the potential of newtypes are, and what things they offer? If you do, watch this movie.<br />
<br />
Narrative is similar to an Avengers: Endgame of UC, and I’ll explain why in the review.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
Before the colony drop in Australia, 3 children go to a beach and see a vision of a colony drop. They warn their town and convince them to evacuate, this leads to a town surviving the colony drop. Their premonition was recognised as a stronger version of Newtype power, and became known as the “miracle children”. Years later, they’re taken in by the Federations in order to study newtypes, and they would eventually be experimented on for further newtype research.<br />
<br />
In truth however, there was only one miracle child, the Rita Bernal. Her abilities are found and she’s modified in order to become the pilot for the third Unicorn Gundam unit, Phenex. However during joint evaluation tests with the Banshee, the Phenex loses control, turning into destroy mode, destroying the bridge of the “Shallot”, and escaping the federation in an event known as the “Shallot Incident”. Since then, the Phenex was lost and never seen again. However, due to the events of Unicorn and it’s usage of psycoframe, the Phenex reappears, once again showing mystical powers like dismantling machinery and communication of souls, something that we saw during the ending of Unicorn. Since then, both the Zeon and Federation want to recapture the Phenex, and harness the power that it has obtained since then.<br />
<br />
The story follows Jona Basta, one of the false “Miracle Children”, and a very, very close friend of Rita. During The Shallot Incident, Rita went missing along with the Phenex, and her disappearance has haunted him since. He joins the operation with the intention of one goal, to see Rita again. There’s a lot more to the story of course, but I’ll leave that to the actual movie to showcase. This film is very focused on newtypes and their potential, far more so than any other UC entry. If you’re a fan of realistic war stories of UC like 08th MS Team or War in the Pocket and only those, you aren’t going to find a lot of that here. Of course, the theme of “war sucks and people in power are awful” still holds true, that’s a Gundam staple, but in comparison, Narrative delves far more into the mysterious side of UC. <br />
<br />
Gonna be honest, the actual story can be considered a problem, simply because not everything is explored enough. Not everything gets an explanation, it also expects you to piece together parts of the story through your prior UC knowledge. The newtype potential is never actually given any solid answer of explanation, and you can take this one of three ways. The first one is lazy writing and leaving plot holes. The second one is seeing it as messages left to interpretation or theorise about. The third, and what I believe, is that the writers want to keep newtypes a mystery, as the theme of newtypes being impossible for humans to truly understand is an underlying theme.<br />
<br />
The story could’ve also been longer in order to focus more on the actual lore of certain characters but if you ask me, it’s not a requirement. This is why you watch this as a fan of UC. It generalises a lot of origins of characters and events because it’s assuming you’re familiar with UC, however that’s also the merit. There are an insane amount of links and callbacks to the entirety of UC. Characters remember events that happened in earlier UC series, that or they were literally directly affected by them. This is why I compare this to Avengers: Endgame, there are so many things in Narrative that mean nothing if you’re not familiar with UC, but if you are, they become some of the best scenes and callbacks to it, and you like the characters because of it. <br />
<br />
The story is not perfect, but it’s serviceable and if you ask me, heavily enjoyable, and if you’re a UC fan, you’re going to get a lot out of every little reference. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
The art style is very similar to Unicorn before it, with a style that relies heavily on color usage and scene palette that while looks nice, isn’t too cleanly “refined”. It’s got little streaks in the lines and movements, like it was less “digitally made” and more “physically made” even if it’s obvious this is mostly digital animation. It’s a style that makes Narrative feel like a modern UC work like Unicorn, but also has the “imperfect” tone of the much older Gundam series, obviously to give the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
What I love about the art style is that, it captures the tone of classic UC series perfectly while also taking the advancements in anime animation. There are a lot of cues and imagery used from classic UC, like the Newtype flash and the purple scene pallet for newtype mind immersion, but reimagined and refined in a more modern light. It’s main charm is how well it captures UC rather than the quality itself, not saying that the animation is bad by any stretch though. Things like the Phenex’s psycoframe is beautiful, and the mech animations are on point. But the usage of homages and such is what really stands out. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Easily the best part of the film from a quality standpoint. The sound design is top notch in every category. Starting with the foley and SFX, everything is amazing, from the power of the beams, the force of the thrusters, and the mystic powers of psycoframe, the sound is top notch. Everything sounds so good, I cannot exemplify it enough. The sound design is godlike and everything sounds super well down. Not painfully realistic, but if you’re into high tech sounding stuff and huge force, you’re gonna love it. <br />
<br />
Score-wise, it’s perfect. Hiroyuki Sawano is always known for his fantastic use of techno beats and drops to make some truly epic scenes feel that much more impactful. Some of the tracks are remixed tracks of Unicorn, but that doesn’t change the fact that those tracks to begin with was top Sawano. The hype doesn’t just come from the drops, throughout the movie there’s a constant thrill created by Sawano’s fast techno tracks that just convey the rush of the power of these machines and the speed of the chase. It’s an absolute ride and Sawano’s score completes every combat scene. Even when it’s not combat, the tracks can be peaceful and have a beating heart that fits the scene it needs to. The ending has this accepting open sounding song and I can’t say enough, the sound design is perfect.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
<br />
This is probably the weakest part of the film overall due to one thing: movie runtime. The characters simply are not fully delved into or properly developed due to it. A lot of the characters’ motives and origins are left for the watcher to assume and piece together as they watch the film, and it never explicitly states enough of the backstory for the film to truly make these characters realised.<br />
<br />
Despite this, I can say this, the characters are very likeable. A lot of the characters are simple but all do their job, although the only ones I can really talk about are the main cast. Jona Basta is a very simple protagonist with the sole goal of being with those he loves. His family was killed at a young age, and he’s only left with his best friends Rita and Michele, they are figuratively his everything, especially Rita, who acted as a guiding light to his early life. When Rita disappears and Michele seemingly betrays his trust, he’s left distraught and full of regret, with his only goal in life being to find the Phenex and reunite with Rita. I like Jona, his goal is simple but believable. It’s only natural for him to want to cling onto the remaining people he loves.<br />
<br />
Michele is by far the most interesting of the three. She is the only one that isn’t “pure good”, as while every goal she has is well-intentioned, she is also willing to do questionable things in order to reach them. As she was adopted by the Luios through lying that she was the real Miracle Child, she was let out from the newtype training facility. As a result, Rita and Jona were left to be studied as newtypes, which is why Jona felt betrayed by her. However, her intentions were not selfish, and that she merely wanted power to retrieve her friends when she could. By then though, Rita had already disappeared along with the Phenex, and she has to hold that burden. She has the most depth and interesting concepts, however the movie doesn’t focus on her enough to have everything she represents resolved perfectly.<br />
<br />
The final character, Rita, has the least to say about her actual character. Rita is the definition of a purehearted and kind girl, being the one who kept Jona’s spirits high since childhood and is a guiding light. We aren’t shown much about her, but we are shown that she was very close to the two, and cherished them a lot. Sadly, despite being the miracle child, she was experimented on and made to pilot the Phenex, and she lost herself when the Phenex ran wild and escaped. I won’t say more, as most of the things related to her are spoilers to the actual plot. But I will say, Rita is the most important character in the entire film and continues to be the most kindhearted, and it all relates to the Phenex. <br />
<br />
The Phenex itself can also be considered a character of it’s own, which you’ll see become very evident once you see the film. The Phenex has a will of it’s own and acts on it’s own. It is a guardian of humanity, but will not allow itself to be restrained by them. It appears for the sole purpose of protecting humanity, and that’s even made evident by the theme “VigilaNTe”.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there isn’t much to say. Zoltan is very energetic as a villain but is also very barebones and underdeveloped, he could’ve used more depth to him. The Schezarr team are probably the most grounded characters, Iago especially is likeable for his relatability as a pilot and due to something that’s revealed in the film that I’m sure audiences that know their UC can relate to. It’s characters have fantastic concepts, and the biggest problem is that they aren’t looked into enough.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
Even with these flaws, I’d be lying if I said I was bothered by them. I’ve seen this movie three times in 24 hours, enjoying it to hell each time and connecting the pieces together, with the story making more and more sense upon each rewatch. It’s thrilling, it has unique concepts that delve into the possibilities of newtypes and humanity’s control on it. The space chances were thrilling, the Phenex was amazing, and seeing it all with beautiful animation and Sawano’s intense score made it such an experience. <br />
<br />
A lot of people criticise the film for being too short and underdeveloped, and I understand it. However, I think the film doesn’t REQUIRE it either. We know what we need to for the characters, we know their goals, the story, and the intended message. Sure, Zoltan is very basic as an antagonist, and the characters in general feel underdeveloped. Still, I’ve never felt unsatisfied on any of my watches, if anything, I get more impressed by the narrative (heh) of the movie and the story it tried to tell. I love Jona, and I merely want him to be happy with his friends. I love the Phenex, a beautiful machine that humanity cannot understand. The symbolism, the meaning, combined with awesome fights and sounds made it all so enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
This film is not for every gundam fan, it will never be by nature of focusing on an aspect of gundam that’s always been very wishy washy, that being newtype shenanigans. However those that are able to see the characters and the story as what they are instead of what they could be can potentially really enjoy the movie. Narrative is just a thrilling ride of pure mecha action that’s still combined with the classic Gundam message of humanity’s conflicts, the underlying themes of oldtypes misunderstanding the idea of Newtypes and trying to use it as strengthening power rather than letting people change for the better and be free. <br />
<br />
There’s so many scenes that mean so much to those that are fans of the UC, and if anything, this movie was clearly made by people who loved the original UC series. It’s for fans of UC, it’s for those who know their lore and want to see a continuation of the early stages of the timeline. People may not love it, and that’s fine, but if you’re a gundam fan, consider giving it a watch, you’ll find something to enjoy.

    First off, if you haven’t watched the original Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and Gundam Unicorn, not a single second of Gundam NT would make any sense. Whether bc of lore, locations, power scaling, characters, or the geopolitical situation, this is not an entry level Gundam. On one hand that’s good because it can get right into the good stuff, but on the other hand, it’s a damn shame bc this was an excellent Gundam movie, and not as many people can enjoy it. <br />
<br />
The fights were beautiful, flashy, and made sense based on power levels (looking at you original Gundam). Of the Gundams I’ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310109">
        watched, this one has the most dialogue during battles, which I’m not sure how I feel about but it definitely wasn’t disruptive enough to be a strong negative. <br />
<br />
The story was great and told really well. It used flashbacks to the MCs’ childhoods a lot but they did it in a way that was both interesting and non-repetitive and mostly non-disruptive. My biggest complaint would be that the antagonist was a “Big Bad Guy” something that really no Gundam (that I’ve watched) had done. Big Bad Guys aren’t nearly as interesting because the second you see them you automatically think “oh this guy is evil.” You don’t get the chance to hear them out first - if they even have anything to say. Sgt Zoltan, the Big Bad Guy, actually did have a real motivation which was revealed in the last few scenes but even that was only inserted at the end when you already had an unchangeable opinion of him (the motivation sucked anyway which is also a negative). There were some points that the philosophy was a little heavy-handed and some points where it fit to a T.<br />
<br />
Story: 7.5/10<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
Character: 6/10 but mostly weighed down by Sgt Zoltan<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Overall: 8/10

    One could say this had a messy.... narrative.<br />
<br />
To wit:<br />
<br />
STORY/CHARACTER: The story is extremely messy and not well told. None of the characters are particularly interesting or fleshed out. Especially the ultimate villain. He&#039;s literally nothing and his mecha are just retreads of stuff from the Unicorn series.<br />
There&#039;s interesting nuggets in the overall story but nothing to actually give this movie a reason to exist.<br />
<br />
ART: Also messy. The designs are good, but the actual implementation and animation are not great all the time. Some returning characters look really derpy.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Sawano score so if you&#039;ve heard one of his OSTs you know what you&#039;re in for. Dub

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302034">
        was fine. Not amazing just fine. Good overall sound design for the foley.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a fine ride (in theatre) but outside of the theatre its not worth it imo. It doubles down on the most controversial part of UC Gundam (newtypes) so if you&#039;re a 0083/08th MS/Thunderbolt kinda fan, don&#039;t bother. If you like the weird stuff in UC, you&#039;ll be more inclined to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final rating: super OK/10

    (TLDR at the bottom, thanks for reading.)<br />
<br />
This review is going to be split up into two parts, part 1 will be a very opinionated take from a gundam fan and how this entry affects the overall canon and the second part will be a less opinionated, more standard review of the film.<br />
<br />
Part 1 - Gundam:<br />
<br />
Harutoshi Fukui seems to of had 3 specific goals when making gundam NT. The first one was &quot;how can I make sense of all the newtype bullshit in gundam?&quot;, &quot;How can I make a thematic end to UC?&quot; and, &quot;Why is there no psycho-frame in F91?&quot; Fukui tried to make sense

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402382">
        of what a newtype is by retconning everything we previously knew about new types by giving his own definition. But to understand what the issue with this is we will need to understand what a newtype is and what&#039;s so wrong with NT&#039;s version.<br />
Newtypes have never been easy to explain but if I had to sum it up in two word&#039;s it would be &quot;wordless understanding&quot;, one of the major themes of gundam is understanding. If all humans could understand what everyone felt then we wouldn&#039;t have these petty conflicts beyond ourselves, if humans could understand each other they could stop fighting and build a better world for each other, and not trying to make it worse. This is the direction char&#039;s counterattack went and it works as a perfect conclusion for that as it sums up all of gundam&#039;s thematic ideas as well and laying to rest the story of the characters. Then there is gundam NT which tries to change it so newtypes are &quot;humans who can reach into another dimension where the souls of the dead exist and that they can manipulate this dimension to do all kinds of things, including time travel&quot;. Does this answer some of the newtype bullshit present in other series? It can but at that point, you are bending over backwards to provide an answer for gundam because it is not giving you one. Does this completely damage any of the previous thematic aspects of gundam? Absolutely, if new types are more akin to Jedi&#039;s or sorcerous then some of the pivotal moments of the series lose all their impact. Because if newtypes have these godlike powers then it loses all weight when they can achieve something because it is no longer something they achieved through their actions but something that was achieved through the superpowers that they magically got. Because of this retconned new type meaning it now means that psycho-frames essentially allows humans to have the power of God so an alternate dimension has to send the time-travelling. self-piloting Phenix to stop it.<br />
<br />
You can dislike an anime because of what it does (or doesn&#039;t) achieve in its runtime but anime that retroactively make other series worse are on a whole different level of bad.<br />
<br />
Part 2 - Gundam NT:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Even ignoring the ramifications that NT has on the overall gundam canon it is still a bad movie. Its characters are flat and unappealing, its plot is poorly explained, even what plot is understandable is bland and reused from other gundam series and at the end of it, it is just a gundam style retelling of the myth of Icarus, even though that the myth of Icarus is used in multiple pieces of fiction and has lost most of its impact. And a forced return of Banarger links makes it clear what the point of this film is, to be fanservice for unicorn fans.<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals:<br />
<br />
This is the one thing the film succeeds in, while some of the character designs are a bit ridiculous (Zoltan) on average the mecha and character designs are fine, and so are the visuals and sound. The only issue is because of the lack of emotional investment stemming from the paper-thin protagonists the fights can only serve as eye candy. <br />
At least the film is only 90 minutes long<br />
<br />
TLDR: For people who like the magical aspect of gundam you might enjoy gundam NT but for anyone else you probably won&#039;t enjoy this film. Just don&#039;t take its plot ramifications too seriously.

    This movie is simply awful.      If you&#039;re an older fan like me, your tolerance for poor storytelling becomes lower and lower.    Nothing about this felt like a Gundam property - the returning cameos from Unicorn are barely seen and look awful without YAS&#039;s guiding hand - Mineva Zabi looks okay, but mostly because she stays seated in a chair and doesn&#039;t turn her head or change expressions.    The rest of the characters look like turn of the century central casting - the female lead looks like low-budget Faye Valentine, the flashbacks to the kids

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302498">
        look like Elfen Lied.    And everything has a bad fit and finish to it - even the promotional stills for this have a grainy, digipaint quality to them - nothing like the high polish of Unicorn.      Oh yeah - and did I mention that there&#039;s this time travelling golden 3rd Gundam that looks like a throwaway concept from Zoids?    Everything about this is a weird revival of the worst tropes of late 90s/early 2000s anime - fisheyed cockpit views of maniacal unglued evil guy while he cackles being the thing I keyed in on.     Anyway, this was just a giant disappointment and in the Fathom Events showing I was at, there were people from 5 to 70 watching and NONE of them seemed to be very enthused by the time the credits rolled.

    This was probably the kind of sequel that Unicorn deserves. Personally, I actually enjoyed this more than Unicorn, but that&#039;s because enduring Unicorn is like watching paint dry, paint that retcons several important story elements of the universe with an incredbly silly central conflict. NT strives to improve on the formula by not having a central conflict instead.<br />
<br />
Much like my review, this film is a mess. By the virture of it being mercifully shorter than Unicorn, I enjoy it a bit more. It still suffers from nearly every problem that it&#039;s predecessor does. Lame characters, thin narrative, and too much super robot nonsense. I know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309309">
        the franchise isn&#039;t afraid to dip into the supernatural once in a while, but NT officially jumps the shark into science-fantasy territory, as the powers of newtypes are expanded once again to include time travel. Nearly every battle in NT is resolved by people shooting mind lasers at each other. The conflict in this film is absolutely impossible to care about as a result.<br />
<br />
The &quot;story&quot; of this movie is as follows, three children are credited with saving a town after they have a vision of the incoming colony drop that begins the war in UC 0079. Decades later, a mysterious golden gundam is inflicting havoc on zeon and federation ships. In search of the secrets behind the psycho-frame system, both the federation, zeon and private companies begin moving to capture it for themselves. The three children find themselves interwoven with this mysterious machine, as it links to their past together.<br />
<br />
About halfway through the film, this plot is thrown out of the window. Eventually, everybody has a big fight and the film kind of ends without an actual conclusion.<br />
<br />
The main antagonist is a generic crazy man who looks like he walked out of a Tokyo Ghoul cosplay event. He&#039;s also yet another attempt to clone char, becuase NT is a distilled parody of everything people hate about modern UC. For some reason he completely derails the plot near the end and takes over the entire movie. He sucks. He really sucks.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is a strong contender with Seabook for blandest Gundam protag in history. He has no personality, barely has any scenes to himself, and generally just goes along with whatever people tell him to do. I won&#039;t hold it against the film that he&#039;s not the main focus, becuase there is something that resembles an attempt to make an ensamble cast here, it just fails at it. Most of the characters aren&#039;t on screen long enough to leave much of an impact.<br />
<br />
The writing in this movie is completely wretched. From the moment that the film makes it&#039;s first bird allegory you know you&#039;re in for a bad time. Discussions about god, heaven, and how being a bird isn&#039;t possible for a human being follow. If this sounds like something that would make you want to bash your own head in, please heed my advice and avoid watching this. The film also likes going through the same flashback over and over again, which feels like padding.<br />
<br />
This film is not good. I really hope that somebody puts this poor, abused timeline out of it&#039;s misery before any more of these get made.

    This is an excellent ending for the UC timeline, even though some things might change after the Hathaway´s movies.<br />
<br />
The visuals are even more impressive than the ones you see on the Gundam Unicorns movies, <br />
but I believe that Sunrise should had remake the scenes from previous Gundams (mainly the ones from Zeta, ZZ and Char&#039;s Counterstrike).<br />
<br />
Pace is a little quicker, but it doesn&#039;t hurt the story to much.<br />
<br />
However, the most amazing thing about this anime is the soundtrack. Powerfull songs like Vigilante (that I&#039;m quite sure represents Jonan and Rita relationship) and the ending them by LiSa, Narrative make you feel that this 1,5 hour

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331551">
        movie is pretty worth.<br />
<br />
If you are new to the franchise, I won&#039;t recommend you to start here, since there is a lot o references you will miss from past series, if you are already hooked on the UC timeline, this is one of the best stories told about this universe.

    After seeing Dragon Ball Super: Broly on the big screens (and the last couple of DB movies) I really wanted Sunrise to put out a good Gundam movie. I paid to see this in the theaters with my brother, who is a bigger Gundam fan than me. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. This movie proves that Sunrise has no respect for their franchise and that the Japanese Gundam fanboys will literally just accept anything because of their love for robots punching face. I don&#039;t like Gundam Unicorn because it&#039;s just a bad rehash of Universal Century with new animation, but with far worse characters. I&#039;m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313946">
        not in love with the Gundam franchise either, I don&#039;t care for Zeta, but I do like 0079, Wing, G, and IBO. This movie ended up being one full priced ticket just to see a TEASER of Hathaway&#039;s Flash. Such blatant disrespect.<br />
<br />
Gundam NT just sucks, regardless of whether you&#039;ve seen every Gundam series or not. The story was paper thin, which is infuriating for a movie called NARRATIVE. The characters are just as thin as the story (and I swear if I hear &quot;I want to fly away like a bird!&quot; one more time, I will lose it). This movie is cliche anime super robot nonsense, and not in a good way either (this is no Gurren Lagann). Ironically, the most interesting character is the character that is the most poorly developed, Zoltan, who is a failed Char clone. But they don&#039;t really explore that idea, he just fights and predictably gets defeated. It also wasn&#039;t lost on me that they expanded the powers of Newtypes, now they can time travel (because reasons). The story revolves around three children who see a vision of the coming colony collapse, but halfway through the film this plot is dropped in favor of the action. If you like this movie, you have incredibly low standards for mecha anime. Even if you have low standards, don&#039;t watch this.<br />

    [Edit] As someone who watched all the Gundam series, I must say that I was excited for NT Gundam. Although the movie is fair, I have some complaints and some mixed opinions about it. Overall I think that if this was a series it would be 100% better. See more below.<br />
<br />
Story: Good story but badly directed. NT Gundam is the latest release of the UC (but not the last, chronologically), taking place after Unicorn. I would say that you need to have seen MS Gundam, Zeta Gundam, Char`s Counter Attack, and Unicorn Gundam before attempting to see NT. The story takes a HEAVY, and I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310548">
        must emphasize a HEAVY focus on Newtype lore. If you are used to the UC, you know Newtypes are a big deal in this universe and NT Gundam brings them to new heights - and that`s my complaint. The UC, in general, always had a balance between the political aspects of the world and the Newtype lore, which is by default metaphysical.  NT Gundam has no balance and its 80% metaphysical. Don`t get me wrong, it is a fair movie, and you should watch, but don`t expect a compelling story. Since the Newtype lore is only acceptable by metaphysical terms, they spend half the time explaining this reality so it becomes acceptable by us, the viewers. This takes away the focus on the story and creates a gap that is filled by something we don`t actually care about and never cared until now. So far, the Newtype lore was acceptable like &quot;Ok, we don&#039;t need to understand more because is metaphysical, now give me more politics and war&quot;. Now is &quot;Ok, get this, Newtypes are the core of the UC and we will revolve around them&quot;. Thus, the story lost me in this aspect because it wasted so much time trying to convince me of the Newtype reality instead of just delivering me a story. But it is well done in its psychedelic reality. If this was a series I think it would be 10.000x better because this Newtype focus would be diluted and not invasive as it was. Also, there are way too many flashbacks and that&#039;s pissed me off, particularly. <br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound: It is the latest Gundam, so... HD, good sound, solid OST, nothing to complain. I am, though, not a big fan of the kind of rock they put in there, its a sort of pop-rock. I rather have some epic orchestra ou harmonics. But hey, it is not bad.<br />
<br />
Characters: I feel that the characters are well done and would be marvelous if this was a series. They clearly have depth, emotions, motivations, and an intricate relationship with each other, but that got rushed and butchered because of the nature of NT (a movie, not a series). Hence, you have no time to explore these characters. I don&#039;t have much to say here except that they are good, but they didn&#039;t have the time to explore them. I, once again, blame the directors. The writers did their job, but the directors&#039; choices butchered their potential. And surprise... no character is annoying. Victory!<br />
<br />
Mechas: Hohoho. Saying the mechas look amazing is not enough. Phenex, the major Gundam of NT is f****** amazing! Narrative is also magnificent and the others look all awesome. Phenex, of course, is similar to Unicorn and Banshee, but Narrative looks like an RX-78 Mark II fused with Unicorn. I liked to the point I want to build their gunplas now.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a decent film, a solid addition to the UC. However, the metaphysical focus of the story created a major problem in therm of the script which diminish your enjoyment of the story. The constant use of flashbacks also affect the pace and that&#039;s why this should have to be a series instead of a movie. All the elements for a potential &quot;best UC story so far&quot; are there, but they did not play their cards right. I blame the directors for all these weird choices and Bandai for making this a movie instead of a series.

    And thus, we arrive at the reason I started reviewing all of the Gundam-Related stuff I have watched.  See, the Gundam Unicorn Anime only adapted 10 of the eleven Light Novel Volumes, likely because the final Volume was released so much later than the rest (No, seriously, by the time it was released the OVA had already ended). So yeah, now there’s an eleventh volume (Named “Phoenix Hunting”) and thus Sunrise decided to adapt it into a full 90 minute movie. Thus was born Mobile Suit Gundam NT (Pronounced “Narrative). This movie has very quickly proven itself to be very divisive among the fanbase,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310106">
        with some liking it, some hating it. So, let’s see what I ended up thinking about this movie.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Not using the name Unicorn anywhere in the tile was probably a good idea, as this movie, while technically an epilogue to Unicorn, feels almost like a standalone story that just so happens to be set right after Unicorn’s events. It’s also apparently a very loose adaptation of Phoenix Hunting (Not that the original Unicorn OVA was the most accurate of adaptations either from what I’ve been told), however I have not read the Novel so I don’t know exactly what has been changed bar some very general stuff. Though the fact that so many changes were made does surprise me given that the Novel’s original Author (Fukui Harutoshi) did have a rather direct involvement in this film.<br />
<br />
On that note, they do a pretty good job at establishing this new situation in the short runtime they had. The whole concept makes sense, with it being a natural pay-off after Unicorn’s events. I also feel it does a good job at tackling the whole theme of eternity and death. Both are heavily touched upon, with them somehow being driving forces behind the plot. It also feels like a complete story. That’s what pissed me off so much about F91, that it felt like a story trimmed down as much as possible. Here, we have a very clear beginning, middle and end, with each having their own conclusion.<br />
<br />
There is however one slight issue with this movie. It’s not that big a deal, but this movie can be kinda confusing at times. There are some points in which you have to look back at some scenes and wonder “Wait, what just happened”, namely due to the few times the movie relies on abstract imagery to convey what’s going on. It’s not that big a deal, and by the end I did get what was going on, but it is something that deserves to be mentioned and a slight point against this movie. I also feel it could’ve used a few more minutes to its runtime (Maybe 15 more minutes) but that’s just a nitpick on my part. A bigger issue though is the abundance of Newtype Magic, which is at its absolute most ridiculous here. I didn’t mind it as much as everyone else, but I will admit it is a problem.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Overall the cast is pretty decent. Our main trio of Jona, Rita and Michele do a good enough job at being likable enough and they do have good chemistry with each other. Their problem ends up being that (With the exception of Michele) they are kinda generic. Still though, for what they are, I like them. There are also a few returning characters from Unicorn, though their roles are relatively minor, which I feel was for the better as I don’t think they would’ve worked that well with a major role in this story.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is okay, however bar Iago and Brick, most of them sadly didn’t have enough time to develop much, and the same goes for the other Zeon characters. The exception to this Zoltan Akkanen, the main antagonist and best character in this whole damn movie. This guy is a complete nutcase, like if you took all the Zeta-era Cyber Newtypes and took the crazy factor up to eleven. Every scene he’s in is delightful to say the least, and he was easily one of the best things to come out of this movie. Some people have argued he’s too over the top to be a Gundam villain, but... just as a quick reminder, this is the same franchise that Rau Le Creuset is a part of AND also the same timeline in which Ginias Shalinin and Yazan Gable exist. Plus, given his backstory, his behavior makes some sense. <br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
Say whatever you want about the plot and characters, this movie is the best looking thing to come out of Gundam yet. Everything I stated in my Reviews of Unicorn and Origin applies here, if not even moreso. What surprised me the most was the CGI was used far less often than those two. It’s still used quite a lot, but compared to other Gundam-Related stuff from this time, there is a lot more traditionally animated MS this time around. And wouldn’t you know, they look absolutely amazing. Needless to say, this film is a visual beauty.<br />
<br />
The Mecha:<br />
<br />
I quite like the mecha here. The Narrative is simple, but it gets the job done quite well, with the many appearances it takes over the course of the film all being quite nice. The Sinanju Stein and the Neo Zeong II seemingly seem like simple repaints of their predecessors, but it turns out they have a lot more to offer than what it seems. Of course, the real show stealer is the Gundam Phenex, which is a great adition to the Unicorn line and a beuty to look at in both modes. Also, they managed to smuggle in a Layzner reference with it, which just makes me really happy.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was good, but I feel this is a downgrade from Unicorn’s OST, which is odd as Sawano Hiroyuki did return. I dunno, I just feel that there weren’t enough grandiose themes in the movie like in Unicorn. Still though, what is there is pretty great, with the ending theme, “Narrative”, being quite good in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
The cast does a pretty good job. Enoki Junya steps up as Jona as his performance is quite nice, managing to do the best out of an otherwise unremarkable character. I don’t know much about his two co-stars (Muranaka Tomo and Matsura Ayu) but they did a pretty decent job. The best performance of the movie, appropriately enough, belongs to the best character in the movie, as Umehara Yuichiro just goes all out with his performance. Also, as you would expect, the returning characters from Unicorn regain their voice actors and all do a good job. Beside them there’s also Furukawa Makoto, Nakai Kazuya, Hoshino Takanori and Terasoma Masaki.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
This movie will likely remain divisive until the end of time, whether we like it or not. As far as I myself am concerned, I really liked it. It has its faults, sure, but as a sequel to my favorite Gundam series, I was satisfied. Now is it better than Endless Waltz? Err… no. While this movie does a lot right, I ultimately feel that while Endless Waltz does a lot more wrong, the stuff that is done well is done far better there than here. In the end, this is very much a love it or hate it movie, thus I would recommend approaching it with caution, but I’d still say you should watch it, if only to know which side you agree with.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    While this movie scores a 7 in my books, its mostly carried by how amazing the movie visually is.<br />
<br />
Gundam NT takes place about a year after Gundam Unicorn, and is a part of the UC storyline, so a lot of context from previous entries are required for you to fully grasp whatever topics are discussed in NT. Otherwise, the story is very thin granted just enough to be its own 90 minute entry.<br />
<br />
Gundam NT has amazing art, animation, score (thanks Sawano), the VAing can get your spine feeling chilly for how well the actors played their part, the MS designs don&#039;t stray from previous entries

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340507">
        yet feel distinct enough for you to pick certain models out from a crowd.<br />
<br />
TLDR, Gundam NT is an enjoyable movie thanks to the visual and audio design, only let down by how much context is required and how little plot they tried to fit into a 90 minute timeframe.

    Oh, boy. If you enjoy the Gundam&#039;s Universal Century timeline entries for its grounded take on mecha combat, and for pioneering its approach to &quot;real robot&quot; mecha lore, Gundam NT is NOT the film for you.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to cover most of the things I disliked about it, and then end on a positive note with some things I enjoyed. I will do my best to avoid major spoilers but be warned there may be some.<br />
<br />
First off, do NOT see this movie if you&#039;re not caught up on all the other UC shows, at least through Zeta, and preferably through Char&#039;s Counter Attack. All of which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302524">
        are pretty much mandatory for background going into Unicorn, which NT is an extension of. So there you go. If you go into this blind you will have absolutely no clue what it going on.<br />
<br />
With Gundam NT, they&#039;ve taken the Newtype Space Magic and leaned even more heavily into it than they did with Unicorn, while also recycling ideas from Unicorn. In other words, between Newtype Powers seemingly being the answer to every problem, and the &quot;Destroy Mode&quot; of the Unicorn and Phoenix type suits, we&#039;ve pivoted fully away from Real Robot and into Super Robot. This alone was enough disappointment for me.<br />
<br />
As far as characters go, the new ones are pretty interesting, or at least they could have been. Our protagonist Jonah is the audience proxy character, he is largely devoid of agency as we are supposed to see ourselves in him. He&#039;s fine. The female lead, Michele, is the most compelling of the three but her motivations are somewhat convoluted. The third character, Rita, seems like she&#039;ll be really important at the beginning but becomes grating for reasons I&#039;ll mention later. We&#039;re given the impression that we&#039;re supposed to care about her, but we&#039;re never really given a reason to, so when a certain plot beat hits, it rings empty, because I didn&#039;t really care about her one way or another.<br />
<br />
Existing characters are great to see on the big screen. I really enjoyed the references to the older series, especially the flashback to Zeta and hearing Char giving his speech, and glimpses of older Gundams. While these were probably my favorite moments of the film as a fan of the classics, the other appearances of existing characters seemed more out of fan service than in service to the narrative. When Banagher appears, he does and says nothing of importance other than exist. Minerva Zabi seems to only be on screen to remind us that she&#039;s alive in her big empty throne room. <br />
<br />
But, that brings me to the main villain. Oh, boy. Not only is he a literal Char Clone, he seems to be pulled straight out of some kind of 2008 teen movie with a super emo bully antagonist. He is poorly written, his motivations are ridiculous - he&#039;s just a bad guy because he&#039;s the bad guy, there is nothing compelling here. Every time he had screen time I just cringed. It&#039;s such a shame because Gundam has had so many compelling rival / villains, and to know that Zoltan will be in the same league of rivals as Char Aznable and Anavel Gato is disappointing.<br />
<br />
As far as the mechs go, they&#039;re ... fine. The Phenex Gundam is an interesting design, but again, it&#039;s very Super Robot. Same for the Gundam NT, which is not only not really given enough time to shine, but has its own Super Robot leanings like its magic box trap thing. It seems like in most Gundam shows the mechs themselves are characters, but in Gundam NT, they seem like afterthoughts, only there to sell Gunpla (more than normal).<br />
<br />
The animation, in action, is messy. I can relate it best to seeing one of the Michael Bay transformers movies. You know there&#039;s robots fighting, but they&#039;re moving so fast that it&#039;s hard to make out any of the details, it&#039;s even hard to follow the action itself. Again, back to super robots - gone is the weight and power of classic UC Real Robots. It&#039;s like the difference between Pacific Rim 1 and Pacific Rim 2. Finally, there&#039;s an &quot;ass-pull&quot; in the &quot;final boss&quot; mecha that Zoltan pulls out of nowhere. I literally rolled my eyes. It is unoriginal and nonsensical.<br />
<br />
I think the most grating thing in the movie though is Rita, and more specifically, a flashback that plays over. And over. And over. About every ten minutes you&#039;ll hear Rita say something about how she doesn&#039;t know if heaven is real, but that she knows souls are real and there is an afterlife. I don&#039;t know how many times you will hear this, I lost count, but it&#039;s a lot. It&#039;s too many. By the time you see the whole scene at the end of the film you&#039;re already sick of it.<br />
<br />
And speaking of that phrase, so much of this movie has to deal with supernatural space magic stuff. Yes, I understand that we have established that Newtypes have at least some ability to exist after death, but I always interpreted it as having been imprinted into the souls of other newtypes, like with Amuro taking on the strength of Lalah. But in NT, they pretty much clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that there are newtype spirit ghosts that haunt things. And it&#039;s just ... kinda silly.<br />
<br />
Music was a little over the top at times, but not terrible. Coming off the heels of Thunderbolt, which has amazing music, this was also disappointing.<br />
<br />
The story itself felt really stretched out. I was checking my watch about halfway through the movie. I dont know if it&#039;s a pacing problem necessarily or that they tried to squeeze too much in, but for as simple as the story is, it felt really long-winded. It also starts with a plot hole, which is never a good sign - Rita as a child has a Newtype vision of the 0079 colony drop and manages to save a town of people. But if she&#039;s an Earthling, how does she has newtype powers? Who listened to an unstable child enough to say yeah let&#039;s evacuate off this crazy kid&#039;s hunch? Right?<br />
<br />
On the plus side. Parts of the movie are very well animated, particularly the opening scenes during 0079 with the birds. When the Gundams are still they look great, like when the Narrative Gundam is in the hangar bay and Jonah is being extracted while other pilots watch. The action scene with some grunt suits chasing down a car was really neat too, I enjoyed the scale shown there quite a bit. As I mentioned, the references to older series was a highlight for me, though all too brief.<br />
<br />
In conclusion:<br />
<br />
+ Nice art &amp; animation, when you can see it<br />
+ Fun references for veteran fans<br />
+ It&#039;s new<br />
<br />
- Uninteresting characters<br />
- Meandering story<br />
- Action scenes are hard to follow or enjoy<br />
- Bad villain<br />
- - Excessive Newtype Space Magic Nonsense<br />
- - Hearing a quote about Newtype Space Magic Nonsense over and over again<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope the next UC movie, which trailered the end of this film, is better than this one was. It wasn&#039;t awful, if you&#039;re a fan of Gundam and have seen the rest of UC you may as well see it, but don&#039;t expect too much here.

    For anyone coming to watch this movie after watching Gundam Unicorn and being blown away by how good it was, be aware that this movie is nowhere near as good as its prequel.  Its plot is also not significant enough to have to watch before watching the Hathaway movies.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Gundam NT mimics Gundam Unicorn with its beautiful animations and catchy soundtrack, but it falls short in terms of characters and plot.  Despite having seen most of the Gundam series from the Universal Century, including the small ovas, I was left confused as Gundam NT left out a lot of explanations for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404584">
        events that &quot;supposedly&quot; happened between Gundam Unicorn and this movie.  I had hoped all of this would be explained later on in the movie, but it never was and it left me feeling like the movie was a waste of my time.<br />
<br />
In short, just skip this movie and listen to its awesome music soundtrack instead.  If you just watched Gundam Unicorn, just skip this and go straight to Hathaway.

    This special, yet semi-short &quot;Gundam&quot; anime in particular showed  a lot things that were in the original mobile suit gundam unicorn series. I just wanted to clarify that the information was accurate, well I want to say is that this event indeed happen during a time when the three main characters where just innocent children caught up in a terrible situation. They did the best hey could to survive, all of them. The fact they made this type go gundam to catch another? proves that both the feddis and neo zeon were both indeed desperate people, bought fighting, but fighting on opposite sides of

    I went in into Narrative expecting a dumpster fire of a movie that tried to piggyback itself into the heart of the viewers by referencing older Gundam works, want to guess what i got? Yeah, it couldn&#039;t even do that, it couldn&#039;t even made me go &quot;Oh! look, that&#039;s something that Kamille did in Zeta!, or look! i know that! that&#039;s like the ZZ&#039;s High Mega Cannon!&quot;<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
But, let&#039;s start from the beginning, aka, the story, this part of the review contains spoilers for the entire movie, and its gonna be long, very long, but the thing is so bad i just HAVE to talk about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351891">
        it, also, i actually encourage you to read through it so that you can save yourself an hour and a half of time and fucking go watch De:vadasy or something.<br />
<br />
The story is...so paper thin, that you could say its literally two-dimensional, half of the fucking story doesn&#039;t make any sense and has no explanation whats so ever, except for &quot;Newtype Autism!&quot;.<br />
I actually believe it was written by somebody who just glanced over the wikipedia page for the classic UC quadrilogy and thought &quot;well, adding this and this would be neat, oh, of course my characters must shit all over Amuro, Kamille and Judau! who cares about them? Banagher? oh yes, yes, he is shit too compared to my characters!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Starting in, if you watched 0079, you probably remember that the Feddies started taking Zeon seriously when they dropped a goddamn colony on Sydney and killed millions, but...what if, nobody was actually killed? why? cause of three random kids that randomly developed newtype powers and advised everyone to get the fuck out of there? yes, if you are asking, no, those kids never went to space, they just randomly got Newtype autism out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
The story continues in UC.097, one year after the Laplace box incident, we find ourselves involved in a peculiar situation...a Gundam chase, so then, what Gundam are we chasing? is it the Unicorn? did the Nu return from Beyond the time? did Jesus Yamato open a portal to the UC timeline? is Gigantis (cough cough Ideon) out for blood? no, unfortunately, but well, what if i told you that there was another Gundam in the UC project, one even more powerful than both the Unicorn and the Banshee: The Phenex, a Gundam which went missing the day that the Laplace box was unsealed.<br />
<br />
After a small fight scene, we are introduced to our main characters back to earth, Jona and Michele being two of three grown up kids that saved the Aussies back in the day.<br />
<br />
Then, the movie tells us that after Laplace box, the Federation dismantled both the Unicorn and the Banshee cause they where too dangerous to be left functioning, and then, for some retarded ass reason, they created another Psycho-frame, NTR...D capable Gundam, called &quot;Narrative&quot;, Jona, being the main character of the movie, is of course the pilot of it.<br />
<br />
The second character of the trio, Michele, is introduced as a fortuneteller and is somewhat able to see the future using her Newtype abilities, she used this apparent power to make her company &quot;Luio e Co&quot; rise to be successfull and gain support from the federation.<br />
<br />
After being introduced to them, we are immediately shot up in space, where we see the Narrative Gundam in action during a training session, and see that Jona is actually a pretty bad pilot all things considered, even tho he is supposedly Cyber-Enhanced, or at least the pilots he is training with believe so.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, let&#039;s talk for a second about Cyber-Newtypes, or Enhanced humans as Japs like to call them, in particular, the ones that the Feddies made: rolling back our story a bit, after the trio of kids that saved Sydney, nicked, Miracle Kids where discovered, they where immediately sought after by the Titans, and where brought to one of the many institutes that enhanced people to create Newtypes.<br />
<br />
The conditions where very harsh to our poor trio of protagonists, since the Titans discovered that only one of them was actually a decent newtype, and so where thinking about something that would cause the kids to reveal who is it between them, considering that they also had to deliver the NT to a company: Luio e Co.<br />
<br />
Things weren&#039;t really the best for our protagonists too, especially cause Michele wanted Jona to throw his sausage into her hallway, but the latter would have much rather thrown in into the the third miracle kid: Rita, with Rita being the true Newtype of the trio.<br />
<br />
The Titans come out with a plan, if they don&#039;t spill the beans about who the Newtype is, two of the kids are gonna end up dead in the end, Michele overhears them, and convinces Jona to reveal that Rita is the Newtype...and then things start making much less sense, with Michele being taken to Luio e Co instead of Rita? the latter being Cyber-Enhanced and Jona living on without modifications of any kind and getting kicked out once best girl Kamille lets the AEUG win the Gryps war.<br />
<br />
Returning to 0097, our protagonists are able to track down the Phenex, and follow him...but they aren&#039;t alone, a band of Neo Zeon remnants is also tracking down the Phenex, with one of them being a failed Full Frontal that went crazy due to the modifications done to his body, piloting, a Sinanju stein that also uses a Psycho-frame, also, has another Neo Zeong prototype just lying around.<br />
<br />
So, both sides enter a side 6 colony to follow the Phenex, but discover that the Psycho-frames where resonating and their respective detectors picked up eachother instead of the Gundam, so a fight starts, and the Narrative is losing pretty badly to our failed Full Frontal.<br />
<br />
The Phenex intervenes and we discover that the pilot of it is none other than Rita, who lets us in on 30 minutes of flashbacks in which literally nothing happens, Jona gets angry cause he discovers the truth about why Michele made him spill the beans, and starts going Berserk, so much so that he drags the Neo Zeong prototype out of FFFs mothership and starts wrecking the poor colony killing tens of thousands at the very least.<br />
<br />
Rita stops him using Newtype autism and reveals to him that she is actually dead, and that the only thing keeping her alive is the psycho-frame that keeps her soul anchored, and then...cut to another 10 minutes of flashbacks, Rita uses her omega-newtype retardation to go beyond the speed of light, and then back to some ship talking, that reveal the intentions of Michele:<br />
And bear with me, this entire paragraph will be some of the most retarded shit in any Gundam media<br />
<br />
Basically, she wants the Phenex&#039;s Psycho-frame so that she can use it to make everybody immortal by trapping their souls in machines...cause, that makes any fucking sense, oh, and apparently Newtypes are now some kind of higher dimensional entity and the Neo Zeong is also not from this dimension, why you may be asking? cause Char gave the plans of the Psycho-frame to fucking Full Frontal after his death with Newtype wanking, even tho technology similiar to it, like the Psycommu was in use since fucking 0080 at least, or, are you telling me that the Gundam Alex is a not from this dimension? or that some random Newtype ghost came in and gave the plans to the feddies or something?.<br />
<br />
I swear, when i first read this, i thought i had the wrong subs or something, checking in...no...seems like i this is it...<br />
<br />
Anyway, this leads to the final fight against FFFs Sinanju/Neo Zeong, it goes down as expected:<br />
The Narrative and the Neo Zeong fight, then Phenex shows up, and the Neo Zeong pulls up his trick card, FFF intends to pull up Gundam Villains favourite weapons: Gas, and make it explode so that it destroys an entire colony side, the debris would then fall to earth and...you know where this is going, freeze the earth and yada yada...<br />
<br />
Long story short, the Neo Zeong uses ultra autism to win, but then Michele sacrifices herself and lets the Narrative go all sparkly and Jona to have his anime moment, culminating in him getting into the Phenex and kicking FFFs ass, and using the Phenex retardation powers to stop the gas from exploding.<br />
<br />
In the end, before he goes beyond the time, he gets saved by our favourite Banana making a cameo, and the movie ends here, even toh both Rita and Michele are now dead lol.<br />
<br />
So...let us make a Tl;dr out of all of this<br />
&quot;MY CHARACTERS ARE THE BEST THING EVER! AND NEWTYPES ROCKKK!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#039;s this movie summed up, all of it, from Rita going at the speed of light using Newtype autism to the entire Phenex thing, to a trio of kids retconning the start of the OYW out of existence, there is nothing, in this story, that you can find likable, at least as long as you have watched at least 10 decent anime and aren&#039;t a complete newfag to the genre<br />
<br />
ART<br />
<br />
I am gonna be rather short, the art is good and the animation is solid, this being a Sunrise anime after all, but i still don&#039;t like the CGI mixed in with 2d art<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
Instead of Unicorn&#039;s orchestral soundtrack, in Narrative, there&#039;s a generic J-pop mix, along with some other modern genres, for what there is in there, its even mediocre in of itself<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Jona &quot;Rita have my children&quot; Basta<br />
<br />
Michele &quot;Jona why won&#039;t you give me your children&quot; Luio<br />
<br />
Rita &quot;I have the biggest Newtype dick of them all&quot; Bernal<br />
<br />
Zoltan &quot;I am another Char clone but i look like a punk now&quot; Akkanen<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
If i was a masochist, i think i would have had the biggest boner of my life, but, i am not, therefore, i found no enjoyment in Narrative, and if you aren&#039;t new to Gundam, neither will you, so, don&#039;t watch it and forget it ever existed, there is nothing redeaming about this, while Unicorn had a ton of problems, at least it had a solid base that you could work on and find some positive aspects, and Miss Marida of course, which was my light in the dark while i was watching it.<br />
<br />
But Narrative? Narrative had nothing going for it, the story was vomit inducing and a collection of tropes, the art was just okay (which is not enough for a fucking Sunrise film, a company which held the top spot in animation by 1987 when CCA was released), the music was bland as fuck pop , and our protagonists where some of the worst and most stereotyped characters to ever come out of any anime.<br />
<br />
If works like G Gundam, After War X or 00 make me believe that other authors are actually able to approach the Gundam franchise in a decent manner without help from Tomino, and create fun stories that are absolutely worth sitting in 50 episodes, and that make you feel pure emotions of Joy and Sadness, then works like Narrative make me believe that Tomino should just prohibit anyone else from writing Gundam and secure the copyright for it forever<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m writing a review since I couldn&#039;t stand the fact that this got rated in the same ballpark as Gundam Build Divers, which is an atrocity. <br />
<br />
Most people are comparing NT to Unicorn, which in context took 4 years to develop and spanned 7 episodes. I don&#039;t think people should be biased coming into this, since as a stand-alone it definitely doesn&#039;t deserve to be rated under 7 (for context Yugioh ArcV is at 6.88).<br />
<br />
Gundam has been pretty disappointing when it comes to fights recently. But I disagree with the shits who prefer fights from spinoffs like Gundam Build Fighters to Thunderbolt or NT, Thunderbolt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349394">
        and NT&#039;s stories may be substanceless but undeniably the art and soundtrack make them much cooler (and the whole point of watching gundam is robot freud manly coolness). The fight from the trailer between NT and Phenex was badass and more hype than some of the Unicorn fight scenes. The final boss fight and ending is kind of meh, but it&#039;s passing, a 7/10. The art definitely carries, and I don&#039;t think the soundtrack is bad - people hating on the genre probably shouldn&#039;t be allowed to rate it, it would be like telling someone who doesn&#039;t drink to rate a chardonnay. <br />
<br />
The MC is kind of a pancake but given the amount of content they wanted to cram and the story direction it&#039;s kind of hard to do any meaningful character development. I&#039;ve seen worse for less satisfaction. A lot of this is really based on how cool the suits looked, the battles, and the consistency.

    Mobile Suit Gundam NT is the sequel to Unicorn that was not necessary by any means. I do not think that it is a bad film, I do not think it is an inherently bad idea to create sequels to Unicorn, but this film puzzled me a bit. I just don&#039;t really understand what the film was trying to do, especially through its connection to Unicorn. I think, much like the new golden RX-0 itself, it doesn&#039;t detract from anything, especially Unicorn itself, but doesn&#039;t feel like it really needed to exist. The concept is somewhat interesting, but does not get nearly enough time to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411161">
        really be fleshed out at all. I don&#039;t personally feel any attachment to any of the main three characters, though I definitely think there&#039;s something there. As one can see from these last two statements, the problems with this movie really remain in its runtime and arguably being a film at all. A better understanding of Jona and Rita would do this movie WONDERS. As it stands, Michele is the most interesting character by a longshot. Visually, it feels like Unicorn and retains the Sawano soundtrack, but beyond any of the Phenex&#039;s scenes and Vigilante (which I love) neither really reach that series&#039; heights in those regards. Unfortunately, this film ends up a little forgettable, beyond its connection to Unicorn, but really is not by any means bad at all.
