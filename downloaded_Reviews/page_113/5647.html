    Nice. That&#039;s what this show is. Not thrilling or dramatic or bad, just.... nice.<br />
<br />
I first found out about To Heart when I watched Comic Party, and I thought I&#039;d give it a whirl. Unfortunately I watched To Heart 2 first so I wasn&#039;t expecting much when I eventually got around to watching this.<br />
<br />
That said, I was pleasantly surprised at how different the atmosphere between the two shows actually is. Where the sequel feels quite forced, To Heart is far more natural in the way it progresses. The stories aren&#039;t that different between the two, and indeed the theme (harem highschool romance), is generally quite common

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4595">
        amongst many shows (Clannad, Kanon, Lamune, etc). However when you look a little closer you find that To Heart is actually quite unique in it&#039;s approach to the romance side of things.<br />
<br />
The story doesn&#039;t follow any straighforward plot, but adopts a more episodic approach. This detracts from the various possible romantic developments (of which there are few), but it gives the show a very different feel from the norm. To Heart isn&#039;t a harem highschool romance by a long way. It get&#039;s misnomered as such because people assume that, because it&#039;s based on a dating sim, and has a male lead who meets multiple females, it has to be a harem highschool romance.<br />
<br />
To Heart (unlike it&#039;s sequel), is slice of life. Nothing more, nothing less.<br />
<br />
The episodic nature of the show actually works when you look at it from a slice of life perspective, and the fact that there is no &quot;real&quot; romantic development becomes irrelevant at that point. The true qualities of the show can only be admired when you watch it as a slice of life show, and in this way it reminded me of Aria far more than Clannad et al.<br />
<br />
At times the artwork in the show is exceedingly good. The show makes use of watercolour stillframes to good effect, and although the animation is a little dated compared to most you see these days, it still retains a certain &quot;realistic&quot; quality about it.<br />
<br />
The music in the show is generally quite mellow, again, reflective of the show&#039;s slice of life perspective. The OP and ED aren&#039;t really anything special though, and the sound effects, although quite well used, are sparse at best.<br />
<br />
To Heart doesn&#039;t really have any truly memorable characters (except maybe Multi). Fujita Hiroyuki is generally a nice, caring guy, and Kamigishi Akari is a well rounded, kind-hearted girl. The two have been best friends and neighbours since kindergarten, and the show highlights the strong ties between the two of them. The many female &quot;love interests&quot; in the show are mainly just friends. One or two may have a crush on him at one time or another, but for the most part the &quot;romance&quot; is mainly between Hiroyuki and Akari. <br />
<br />
The supporting characters are generally okay, but nothing special really. I found some of them amusing in some ways, but I didn&#039;t find any of them annoying (I&#039;ll explain why in a bit).<br />
<br />
I think if you approach this show with the assumption that it is a stereotypical harem romance then you probably won&#039;t enjoy it as much as something like Clannad or Kanon. However, if you approach the show from a Slice of Life perspective then it becomes a nice, relaxing way to spend half an hour.<br />
<br />
The main appeal of the show is the &quot;nice&quot;, relaxed feel it has. It won&#039;t appeal to anyone who wants a good romantic story with continuous plot development (watch Love-Com or Bokura Ga Ita for that). It may appeal to fans of Aria though, as To Heart has a similar feel (and both female leads are called Akari). The reason why I didn&#039;t find any of the characters annoying was because of the relaxed feel of the show - the characters didn&#039;t bother me in the slightest - which is very much the same feeling I had when I watched Aria.<br />
<br />
To Heart is a show that is worth watching if you&#039;re in the mood for something nice. It doesn&#039;t bludgeon you over the head with drama or romance or thrills of any sort. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s just.... nice.

    It&amp;rsquo;s funny, when I first started &amp;quot;To Heart&amp;quot; I thought I was going to be in for another harem title, but to my surprise it was nothing like that. This school life anime is probably one of the more layed back and relaxing ones out there!<br />
<br />
The main chunk of the story will be Hiro (main male lead) interacting with the female students. Now I know this may sound like a &amp;quot;harem&amp;quot; plot, it isn&amp;rsquo;t at all though. Whenever he meets one of them that needs help, instead of having a romantic view of them (you know, the whole damsel in distress thing?) he simply helps

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10593">
        them out with their problems like a good friend would. Which in turn really does describe &amp;quot;To Heart&amp;quot; the best...friendship! Many people (like me) would probably go into this anime thinking about romance, after all the title does have the word heart in it, which would be a logical assumption. Not at all though, this titles name is based on simply helping out a friend in need. Which I have to say was a nice change of pace from all the romance and love triangles you would otherwise see in an anime like this. Now that&amp;rsquo;s not to say there is no love interest at all here. Because in episode 1, Akari (main female) does imply that she likes Hiro to the audience, but it never goes past that. Even many of the situation that would implement jealousy is handled in a peaceful manner. In fact some may be surprised to see that not one character ever really raises their voice against another. This probably could be seen as a negative as well though, because most school life isn&amp;rsquo;t that way at all. Since there is no real romance that takes place (though there will be a small amount in the last two episodes), the story may tend to be a bit bland depending on your tastes. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the ending, but I won&amp;rsquo;t spoil it for you.<br />
<br />
The character design is what stuck out for me in the art department, they have a certain noticeably to them...this is especially true when you take a close look at their facial features. The clothing and detail that went into each is really great, and all characters are drawn well balanced as people and not exaggerated. The backgrounds can best be described as &amp;quot;stiff&amp;quot; though, most of them are displayed rather nicely, while others tend to look more like still water color paintings. Because of this you will most likely keep your attention to the actual characters than the backgrounds.<br />
<br />
Well since over 70% of the time there is no real music playing in the foregrounds, means that To Heart gives off a much more calmer feel to it like I mentioned earlier. Most of the time I felt that this series could be a nice stress re-leaser when you&amp;rsquo;re not having the best of days. Now it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have that kind of feel when watching it, but it still would have been nice to have some kind of memorable background track, since the main one that does play is simply a non-vocal version of the opening theme. Now with that in mind the opening and closing theme&amp;rsquo;s are nice, they fit the mood of the title pretty good. Even if the ending feels more along the lines of a re-mixed version of the opening.<br />
<br />
The characters I felt were the weakest link in the anime, now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong they are indeed a friendly bunch. Its just that they are not well varied in their approaches. It seems like you can pretty much describe them all in these three simple words: &amp;quot;quiet, outgoing, middle ground.&amp;quot; The only real noticeable one for me was a girl named &amp;quot;Shiho, &amp;quot; as she tended to have the most spunk of the group, and was probably the only real comical character in the bunch. At the beginning song you see quite a large cast of females, however most only appear for one episode and are never really seen again. Still, they all compliment one another great in the friendship department, and are truly there for one another to pick each other up when they are down. <br />
<br />
To Heart is not funny, deep, or very romantic in any of its aspects. And I have to admit that not having an actual romance plot going on in the overall scheme of things was a bit of a bummer, and romance fans may want to steer clear of this because of that. However, what this title lacks in those aspects, it makes up for quite nicely with its &amp;quot;friendship&amp;quot; approach! If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of nice and peaceful school life titles that really emphasis on helping others, then To Heart&amp;rsquo;s heart...is truly big!<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading my review! :)

The story revolves around 2 high seniors, Akari and Hiroyuki, as they get ready for their final year of high school. Akari and Hiroyuki have been friends for years; ever since kindergarten, and Akari may have grown some certain feelings about her best friend after all these years.<br />

One lovable loser who through some bizarre circumstances ends up surrounded by a group of gorgeous women who all proceed to fall in love with him somehow; and then our protagonist must make the difficult choice of picking the one female cast member to call his own.<br />
<br />
 While it was always a stupid and sexist premise, it proved to be a very popular format (for an almost entirely male audience). And so, many titles made use of the formula with little to no variation. While these titles lacked creativity, they were still profitable and that allowed the same basic story to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33035">
        reproduced many, many times. A ‘tried and tested’ formula simply became a tired one. Eventually, it got to the point that even making a few minor changes would create a stir.<br />
<br />
Like all other harems, ‘To Heart’ is the story of one man and the many women that surround him. Hiroyuki Fujita is like every other male harem protagonist in this respect. BUT...<br />
<br />
(You may want to sit yourselves for this one, guys)<br />
<br />
(Deep breaths)<br />
<br />
(Ready?)<br />
<br />
He’s not a total loser!<br />
<br />
In fact, Hiroyuki is actually quite a nice guy. He helps people out, gives them advice when they need it, is pretty popular and athletic; even if he is a little lazy and forgetful at times. Really, it’s not a big surprise he is so popular with women!<br />
And with that one swipe, Hiroyuki manages to slay the ancient dragon of the harem genre -the completely unbelievable wish fulfilment fantasy of loser male anime fans everywhere-  and rescue one of several girls desperate to be carried off into the sunset by their handsome knight (who won’t be too wimpy to actually carry them for once).<br />
<br />
However, while Hiroyuki being a hit with the ladies may not be completely unbelievable, Whether or not Hiroyuki is a believable character or not, is another story altogether.<br />
<br />
Is he a Gary Stu? No, of course he’s not: He sleeps in classes and he’s forgetful, too. He’s far less a writer’s (or audiences) pet than most other harem protagonists, even if he is a ‘better’ person than they are. The problem with Hiroyuki is not that he is too idealistic; the problem is that his actions do not entirely click with his personality, and sometimes come across as erratic or illogical. <br />
<br />
One moment he’s dozing off while his classmates argue with each other; the next he gets up out of his chair and helps the class representative draw lots for the seating plan. He shrugs it off, claiming that he simply ‘wants to go home’; but when was the last time you saw someone who has half asleep be the first to jump up and help someone out?<br />
<br />
 Another issue is his prioritising of relationships; Hiroyuki usually hangs around with his close friends, but will readily abandon them to jump to the needs of complete strangers. While it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that someone would help out a stranger and perhaps neglect a friend, it is hard to believe someone who goes to great lengths to help others could ignore their friends  with such consistency.<br />
<br />
But perhaps I’m being too hard on old Hiroyuki-chan. While his behaviour feels contradictory at times, he isn’t an easy character to dislike. He’s someone that we can identify with, not as some sort of self-insertion fantasy, but as a nice, friendly guy who we want to be happy.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, he manages not to be the typical harem fare which unfortunately, cannot be said for the rest of the cast, which consists of every Ken Akamatsu harem cliché there is: the childhood best friend, the arrogant tsundere, the underdog athlete, the weird rich girl, the psychic rich girl and even the robot girl; they’re all here. All archetypical, all uninteresting!<br />
<br />
That being said, even if they are unoriginal, they do manage to make for plenty of enjoyable episodes, albeit quite silly at times. Some episodes, such as those featuring robotic girl Multi, and the occult obsessed ojou-samas will no doubt prove to be too ridiculous for some to enjoy.<br />
<br />
The storyline is fairly episodic, with the rule of thumb for the series being ‘one girl; one episode’.  While the characters do make some brief cameos in other episodes, these are always only a few lines of dialogue and are spread very thinly across the series, and they are never developed further with only one or two exceptions other than the main cast.<br />
<br />
But even the main cast feel underdeveloped at times. Most of childhood friend Akira’s appearances in the first two thirds of the series seem to be for the sole purpose of reminding us that she still exists; tsundere Shiho seems to change very little through most of the series only to have a sudden growth spurt as things are winding down, one of the hallmarks of a bad tsundere. Best friend Masahi doesn’t change even slightly and the only thing Hiroyuki seems to develop over the course of the show is a better memory.<br />
<br />
Despite the problems with character development, To Heart does manage to be an entertaining show. The pacing is somewhat slow, largely due to its episodic format, but this suits it well. It gives the show a calm, laid back feel which reflects the personality of the protagonist quite well, and leaves To Heart feeling more like a Slice of Life than a harem; whether or not that is a good thing, depends on personal preference.<br />
<br />
On the artistic front, To Heart is somewhat mixed. Released in ’99, like most anime released at that time it uses cell animation. Thankfully, while clearly not a new release, the art style is pretty good and it doesn’t feel outdated. On the other hand, there seems to have been a fair number of sacrifices on the animation front, and it feels cheaply made at times. In some scenes we have background characters drawn with the same level of detail and quality as the main characters, but left unanimated. These scenes can be reasonably lengthy and the background characters often have expressions that suggest they are talking, laughing or smiling, which aside from looking very low budget, is quite distracting.  <br />
<br />
A cynical person might think that such practices would make static shots of the artwork, such as those featured in magazine advertisements look better. Perhaps with the intention of falsely portraying the art to be of a higher standard than it really is.<br />
<br />
Additionally, lots of scrolling shots of still images are used, and placement shots are used a bit more than necessary. While these aren’t quite as big an issue as the aforementioned background characters, they can feel overused at times. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack can be summarised in a single word: ‘barren’.<br />
<br />
There wasn’t very much background music used in To Heart at all; aside from occasional touches of violins and pianos; usually limited to the emotional scenes. Unfortunately when the lack of background music is combined with the blatant attempts to cut corners in the animation, it casts serious doubt on the possibility that it was intentionally minimalistic. This leaves ’To Heart’ feeling altogether very cheap indeed.<br />
<br />
At least the voice acting work is competent.  While there are no particularly shiny stars among the cast, each one suits their respective role. It has to be said though that there are not any particularly taxing scenes to test the seiyuu’s skills either; ultimately, it shouldn’t get on anyone’s nerves, which in a show like To Heart, is all you really need.<br />
<br />
Because in the end, ‘To Heart’ is an anime that is only slightly above average. The protagonist aside, it’s a cast full of under developed, stereotypical characters put together in an anime that looks alright but feels cheaply produced. It was enjoyable, but it did nothing really special. Hiroyuki may have been interesting as a harem protagonist, but as an anime character, he’s average at best.<br />
<br />
And it’s the same with To Heart. When you compare it with other harem, it’s a good, perhaps even great title. But when you start looking at it beyond the boundaries of the harem genre line, it just can’t cut it. Not because of any flaws inherit in the harem genre; but because overall, it is a mediocre anime.<br />
<br />
 It’s not so much that ‘To Heart’ is in a school of its own; it’s just a top student in a class full of under-achievers. <br />

    	To Heart is easily one of the blandest things I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.  It&#039;s complete lack of substance or anything interesting was very frustrating, especially considering that deep down it definitely had some potential that it just never bothered fostering.  It was fundamentally boring and had very little to offer over all.<br />
	That isn&#039;t to say, though, that it did everything wrong.  I am willing to give it some credit, as there were some things that I did like about it.  The general ascetic of the series was rather nice, having a interesting art style that looked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37614">
        very pretty and a really good musical score that would have done a great job of emphasizing the emotion of scenes if there were any emotion to be found there.  It definitely tried to create situations where one would feel emotion and have a warm and fuzzy feeling, but although I give it an A for effort in that category, it gets a very predominant F in execution.  This failure is caused by two things, first the complete blandness of the characters, especially the main character, and second the complete lack of any sort of story, focus or point.<br />
	The main character Hiroyuki is easily one of the least interesting characters I have ever encountered.  To make matters worse on top of having no personality what so ever he still manages to be a dick, which just adds an additional level of annoyance to his pointless existence.  He has absolutely no chemistry between any of the girls who he arbitrarily hangs out with, demonstrating that he had about the chemical potential of helium.  He truly has no character and this is demonstrated in the sad excuse for what could be called a story this series has.<br />
	To Heart has no plot.  It has no story.  It has no focus.  It has no point.  If I were pressed I would have to say it&#039;s about some guy with no personality hanging out with girls with no personality, for no reason.  Truthfully I can&#039;t explain why Hiroyuki spends time with most of these characters.  He generally seems distant and uninterested in almost everything that is going on, but will still get involved with random people.  His time with these girls feels forced and arbitrary, and the only reason  they wouldn&#039;t be called plot contrivances is because the isn&#039;t a plot.<br />
	The girls themselves are also completely bland, and seems to have no rhyme or reason to their inclusion in the series.  The first is a practitioner of black magic, in that she stands around in a dark room, wearing a witch&#039;s hat and lights candles.  Apparently she did cast some sort of “spell” during the episode she was “relevant” in, but it had no clear effect.  Her most predominant “personality trait” is that she talks really quietly.  Then there is the martial arts girl.  Her “story” is that she is the sole member of a martial arts club, that broke off from normal martial arts clubs because she want to practice some sort of “extreme” martial arts.  Personally I have no idea how her style was different from a normal style, it wasn&#039;t explained or shown as being different, but since she went through the trouble of starting a completely superfluous club, it must have been completely impossible to do it in a normal club.  This ends up reminding me of Hitohira, and anything that remind me of that terrible show automatically adds another level of annoyance to the giant pile.  Oddly enough she was one of the more interesting side characters of the series, but was still largely pointless.  Also there was the girl who was described as having “nothing interesting about her.”  Normally I would complain about her being bland, but it seems the series is at least being honest and already doing that for me.<br />
	At this point we start getting into characters that really just don&#039;t belong in the series, even though it&#039;s hard to properly say what does belong in the series.  The next monster of the week girl is a psychic.  I was willing to buy to occult girl because it was clear that she was just pretending to be magical, but no she apparently really is psychic.  In normal To Heart fashion someone takes interest in her for absolutely no reason, and she gets an episode devoted to her in all her bland splendor.  She is easily the most boring character of the series, but at least she seems to have a love interest other than Hiroyuki, so I&#039;m willing to give her credit there.  The fact that she has an interest in something not completely inert at least shows the potential for chemistry, I guess that would make her more along the lines of Xenon.<br />
	The next character who has absolutely no right to be in the series, also coincides with To Heart pretending it might have a plot.  This character is Multi, one of the more famous of the series, and she is an android.  In a series with no scifi elements, and no indications that this is a futuristic setting, they suddenly throw in an android.  Her sudden introduction completely baffled me and I&#039;m still trying to justify her addition to the “story.”  With her comes the closest thing to a plot the series has.  Multi is a maid robot sent to the school to be tested on her functionality.  Why they would send her to a school makes no sense.  In order to create a false sense of drama, another robot is also introduced, and the robot that performs better of a two week period will be used as the model for future robots.  At the end of the two week period the series attempts to pull at the audience&#039;s heart strings by having her leave, and the main characters throw her something like a going away party.  This of course failed to make me care because a character who was introduced an episode ago having to leave a bunch of people I don&#039;t give a shit about isn&#039;t exactly going to move me.  Also during this “arc” the series tries to get all philosophical, discussing what defines a person with consideration to artificial intelligence.  You know, what almost every other anime ever make has done... better.  And, spoiler alert, Multi comes back for “more testing” not that that really matters since this happens near the end of the series and she has about three lines after this.<br />
	The last “plot arc” has to do with the other main characters who I haven&#039;t talked about yet, mostly because I was too busy complaining.  In addition to the bland douche that is Hiroyuki, there are three other main characters, who were to my surprise not bad.  They are Shiho, the energetic one who actually seems to have a personality, Akari, who is still bland but fleshed out and nice enough for me to at least care about her, and Masashi, the token male friend who whenever he shows up, I cry a little on the inside that he isn&#039;t the main character.  It&#039;s these characters that make the show almost watchable, and truthfully if the show were about Masashi and Shiho and Hiroyuki never existed I would probably like this series.  But no, Hiroyuki has to be the main character, and thus has to be everyone&#039;s love interest.  The last two episodes are devoted to a Christmas part, or more accurately the planning there of.  During this it is made clear that Shiho does in fact like Hiroyuki, but Akari has first dibs being childhood friends and all.  Shiho is indecisive and steps aside for Akari to to starting dating Hiroyuki.  Yeah if you were expecting and romantic end, stop, it ends with nothing happening.<br />
	In the end To Heart is just far, far too bland.  Nothing happens and the characters are boring and unlikable.  During each episode you end up bored out of your mind, and then you realize that you&#039;re only about seven minutes in, and when they episode is three fourths of the way through you realize that nothing has happened yet.  Although there were signs of a potential for something that might have been okay, that seed never got planted.  Its good art style, music, voice acting and the handful of decent characters prevent it from being one of the worst things I&#039;ve seen, but blandness and lack of anything positive prevent it from being decent.  The only reason to watch this is for it&#039;s historical relevance.

    To Heart is the forgotten predecessor to Clannad and the early formula to archetypal dating simulations. There’s a guy surrounded by a bunch of cute girls, with a boring personality, but every few episodes leads to an arc that makes the girls exceedingly interesting or just plain Janes that ONLY have their moe points going for them and nothing further.<br />
<br />
	• The pacing is probably the most terrible part of the first season of To Heart. Everything moves at a colossally languid speed, to the point that I preferred watching the English dub to the sub to avoid falling asleep at some points.<br />
	<br />
	• It was similar

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288246">
        to a boring school visual novel, where the girls make you go help with the student counsel committee and go on errands with them and then you’re just snapping your fingers behind the screen being like, “Just get to the romance already! I don’t want to see these characters doing menial tasks!” In my opinion, the best visual novels are not the ones that take place in high school, but I’ll save that for a later time.<br />
	<br />
	• This comfort-watch molasses became a trend for stories in the mid-2000’s and was a very influential series for the school drama. It made the genre explore otherworldly happenings. The android girl, HMX-12 Multi, was an influential character in the school genre because she made other writers realize that they can put surreal things in a school setting and they don’t have to explain it, just branch it out into it’s own arc, much to the modern anime fan’s dismay who want an ACTUAL explanation and world-building behind an android’s conception.<br />
	<br />
	• You can see the echoes of this effect in Key’s work: Kanon with its demon hunter, Clannad with its random ghost girl, each used to create an angle of intrigue in the school setting. To Heart even inspired an anime called Comic Party, which is an anime about making To Heart doujins. <br />
	<br />
	• To Heart is influential to the romance genre in anime like Urusei Yatsura was a big science fiction influence. But, looking past the noticeable iconicism behind To Heart, I need to criticize the series on what it is rather than what it has produced. The main female character, Akari Kamigishi (for those of you who have seen or played Shuffle, she’s exactly like Kaede, but not yandere) is really cute, but so boring and predictable that at times, it’s hard to root for her. <br />
	<br />
	• WARNING, spoilers ahead: The only point of intrigue that the story had that was truly different from any other, especially at the time, is when there’s a really dark scene between Akari and her best friend, Shiho because Shiho is in love with the protagonist/Akari’s platonic love/boyfriend (it’s practically a harem series, so why wouldn’t she be?) and she lies to Akari about her feelings for Hiroyuki and invites Hiroyuki to her party when Akari’s sick.<br />
	<br />
	• But this moment is undone when the last episode decides to not take a risk, even though the art and directing in the unnerving confrontation scene is very similar to a scene from one of the last episodes of Serial Experiments Lain with it’s surreality (when Arisu learns the truth about Lain), because when Akari says that she’s coming to the party with a cold, Shiho admits defeat and tells Hiroyuki… completely undermining the build-up from earlier in the arc. The milk-toast conclusions to each of the girls’ stories, the slow pacing, and humdrum school setting lands the first season of To Heart, not matter the influence it carries in the genre, on a 4/10.

    Hi guys and gals..Do you wanna know how it is to sit inside someone&#039;s ear and spend the rest of your bloody life doing nothing but just that?Well luckily for ya there is an anime called To Heart.<br />
<br />
Word of warning,this review contains excitement and swearing and some really really graphic sadistic descriptions.With that onto the review of this...I dare not call it s@it cause that would be an insult to good s@it or even bad s@it..This has taken the idea of endless boredom and went all the way to 11 or 789 by the looks of things.<br />
<br />
Stupid name,stupid anime,stupid stupid me for watching this shit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264698">
        without having a spoon around so i can slowly and painfully take my eyes out of their damn sockets.Honestly i&#039;m not being captain dramatic,i wish i had the strength to cut my wrists and watch my blood dripping on the floor instead.It would be better to take a chainsaw,cut my leg and beat my self to death with it.THIS IS HOW BAD THIS FREAKING ABOMINATION IS.<br />
<br />
And looking at the tags i have to wonder...Who in the name of all that&#039;s holyl thought this was a comedy?Who?A carcass perhaps?Someone with the aesthetics of one?Drama?I wish there was cause at least there would be something to indicate a sign of life.Romance?Seriously?That was Japan&#039;s idea of romance?Based on a game?????AHA now we&#039;re talking...Now it all begins to make sense..BASED ON A GAME...I should point out that i haven&#039;t played the game and i&#039;m not going to either but i cannot begin to imagine what the game was like for this anime to be so freaking boring.<br />
<br />
Story?No story whatsoever.Absolutely none at all.It&#039;s just the girl of the week thing where some girl has some trouble and our cast solves it.And it may sound somewhat interesting but trust me it&#039;s not.Cause the way the &quot;drama&quot; is delivered lacks in everything.And it has to do with the characters mostly.The way they&#039;re acting is like they force fed them sleeping pills and told them to go out there and do it.Every single movement every single word they utter is in slow motion.Get this for conversations..Someone says something,the other part hears it,then processes it in his brain,then he breathes,then he makes his head move,then his eyes,then one lip starts moving then the other then some breathing takes place and after one decade has passed he finally utters:&quot;Huh.......&quot;....Kinda like watching an old man with arthritis getting up from his chair.It&#039;s slow and painful....And come to think of it they can&#039;t even be described as characters but to hell with it i&#039;m feeling generous today.<br />
<br />
Mins into the first ep,that is the very first,the intro,the one to sing the blues...And what do we get?A male MC who is sleepy..And stays that way for the rest of the series.A sleepy character who wonders what the hell he&#039;s doing there in the first place.The female MC has no characteristics so to speak.It&#039;s just the girl with her red hair following around the male MC for some reason science hasn&#039;t STILL found an explanation for.And if you think this cannot possibly get any worse.....Oh wait for it..They have a scene where for,i think,10 mins they show a scene of 2 characters ripping a piece of paper..Yup just that and only that.And that was just for seating arrangements..10 mins of the same thing over and over and ov......Zzzzzzzz.<br />
<br />
Yes you might say,but this is Slice of Life...Yeah but if the slice of that life is as boring as watching footage of flowers growing in slow motion then what&#039;s the freaking point?I can watch my nails grow for that matter.But that was the 1st ep right?What about the next..Oh they stepped things up by showing Akari the female MC brushing her teeth for what felt like an eternity.Oh and get this...We come to learn that her dream was to sit next to the male MC whose name i can&#039;t be bothered to remember..Her dream....To sit next to.....Him........Her dream...Not going to space or save 3rd world countries...How much do you want to see that?You&#039;re probably on the floor squealing like a pig in heat..<br />
<br />
Animation and music where...Well rubish.What did you expect from late 90&#039;s anime?It&#039;s dreadful.<br />
<br />
All in all there were 1 or 2 things good with it.Well there had to be really.Nobody can make an anime where absolutely everything is shit from top to bottom.That said even these 1 or 2 things couldn&#039;t keep me awake.I started watching this 11 years ago and midway through i was fast asleep for 2 years.11 years later i finally managed to finish it.And was it worth?Yeah i finally slept like a baby bear but also lost my youth.Is that a price worth paying for?Abso-fuckin-lutely not.Just watch something else.Watch Boku no Pico.Be disgusted not brain dead.

    Although To Heart is labeled as a romance series, it really didn&#039;t focus on that at all. This show mainly focuses on introducing new characters and giving them a little depth. The romance was put on the back-burner and left for the last two episodes.<br />
<br />
~Character 6/10~<br />
Since we were introduced to new characters so often it was hard to get to really know any of them. Akari, Shiho and Heroyuki were the main characters but I really didn&#039;t get the sense of really knowing them or knowing what they&#039;re thinking. Most of the characters seem very dense and unable to read body language.<br />
<br />
~Art 8/10~<br />
The art style

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63415">
        is still great even though it appears to be old. The amounts of detail is wonderful and thankfully the art style was more consistent than most shows. By that I mean there wasn&#039;t any sudden body changes or suddenly a persons head gets huge to show humility.<br />
<br />
~Sound 8/10~<br />
The English dub for this was fairly good. The background music was also great. It got me really into certain moments of the show because the music was just flowing through me.<br />
<br />
~Story 6/10~<br />
There really isn&#039;t a story for this show. It is mainly a random set of events that happen to Akari and Heroyuki throughout a years time. The show starts out with Akari remembering something precious from her past, but that story was only continued within the last couple episodes of the show. Out of all the episodes more than half were about introducing new characters, so things were fairly random more than half of the time.<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment 7/10~<br />
Although I may have been put to tears once, I didn&#039;t really get the sense of being fully engaged into the show. There were good moments and there were a lot of boring ones too. I often got annoyed with characters repeating eachothers lines, it really frustrates me when that happens.<br />
<br />
Overall I would score this at a 7. It was a good show, but nothing I&#039;ll probably want to watch again. My To Heart 2 review should still be around, but be warned it was nasty compared to this one.

    Overall	<br />
Ok, let&#039;s look at the genre tags on this one... <br />
<br />
&quot;Comedy&quot;? No, not a single funny event in the whole series. <br />
&quot;Drama&quot;? No, no, no. Not even a story.<br />
&quot;Game&quot;? Probably. It would explain a lot.<br />
&quot;Harem&quot;? Not really. More like an episodic &quot;girl of the week&quot; show, with very little coherence. <br />
&quot;Romance&quot;? Not according to my experiences regarding the term. <br />
&quot;School life&quot;? Check!<br />
<br />
All in all, this was a waste of time. I was expecting a romantic comedy but all I got was a slow paced and futile &quot;we are gonna throw as many wierd and shallow girls at you as possible&quot; show. <br />
<br />
Ok, some episodes actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179808">
        got me somewhat interested but they really didn&#039;t mean anything in the end. This would have been much better if they skipped most of the pointless girls and focussed on a smaller cast of main characters.<br />
<br />
Animation	<br />
It&#039;s ten years old, so you really can&#039;t expect too much. Nothing fancy, just very standard graphics.<br />
<br />
Sound	<br />
Voice acting felt somewhat above average, mostly due to the absense of extremely annoying voices.<br />
<br />
The intro/outro songs were both pretty dull but the background music was nice. Well arranged orchestral music (some themes were repeated a bit too much though).<br />
<br />
Story	<br />
Not really a story in this one. Just episodic high school stuff. Most episodes are just filler, while some gave the impression that they moved the story forwards. But in the end none of the episodes really mattered. You can basically watch this anime in random order.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER: The 2nd season &quot;Remember my memories&quot; makes up for most of the suckyness of this season. See this more as an introduction to that season instead.<br />
<br />
Character	<br />
Every episode basically introduces a new character, but in the end, they&#039;re all rather pointless. Most characters have no more than one (1) personality trait each, and with the large amount of characters and the slow pace very little development is going on.<br />
<br />
Value	<br />
No re-watch value at all (as there was hardly any &quot;watch&quot; value in the first place).<br />
<br />
The Bishoujo fansubs were good as far as I could tell.

    Apesar da história ser fraca, a animação datada e o final ficar em aberto (bem descarado, por sinal), para quem quer algo leve e não é exigente (MESMO, já que, francamente, deste anime não dá para se esperar praticamente nada - pode ser até que a Visual Novel do qual foi baseado seja um pouco mais interessante), dá para acompanhar sem sustos.<br />
<br />
Mesmo assim, o bom Character Design, as músicas de abertura e encerramento, a trilha sonora, os personagens e algumas das tramas, me fazem lembrar deste anime com certo carinho, já que foi um dos primeiros animes curtos, de temporada, que eu assisti - mas

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312243">
        sei que poucos se sentirão desta forma.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Although the story is weak, the animation is dated and the ending is open (well cheeky, by the way), for those who want something light and not demanding (EVEN, since, frankly, this anime can not be expected practically anything - it can be until the Visual Novel of which it was based is a little more interesting), it gives to accompany without scares.<br />
<br />
Even so, the good Character Design, the opening and closing songs, the soundtrack, the characters and part of the plot, remind me of this anime with a certain affection, since it was one of the first short, seasonal anime that I watched - but I know that few will feel this way.

    So To Heart anime series is a romance story without any romance,meaning all you are left with is SOL and its a bland SOL.<br />
<br />
Its very slow as well,the slowness was kind of refreshing when it was just the 1st episode but then it became very boring and more slow during the next episodes.<br />
<br />
There is no plot,so nothing advances or changes outside of Hiroyuki(the main character)meating some new girls.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Hiroyuki,one thing i give them credit is that he is different,in the sense that he is distant,lazy but sociable enough,he is the only thing i found kind of decent outside of the artstyle(which is way too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383739">
        good for this anime).<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was kind of forgetable,but its not like you can expect much from this show to begin with.<br />
<br />

    I am going to honest here.  First story is lame and very slow, its based on a harem game but in some stories the MC doesn&#039;t seem to make any romantic advancement to any of the girls.  In one story he helps a girl that was bully him and his main squeeze helps her.  She thanks them for the help the whole episode is them getting their classroom ready for a cafe boring.  Talking about boring watch this in 1.2 or high speed because it&#039;s slow and they talk slow.  One episode is them studying for a test and talking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414036">
        about when they were young no flashbacks(i guess not in their budget) just talking and staring not each other but blank staring.   Are the characters any good, one is very good.  She is too good i didn&#039;t want her to start liking the MC but in the end she does.  The male best friend is a basically a back ground character it look like he would good but no after 4 episode you dont realize he exist.  Score decent(4) lol
