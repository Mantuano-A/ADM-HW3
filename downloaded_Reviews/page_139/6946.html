    Every once in a while you’ll come across an anime that’ll literally help you grow as a person, help you understand some things you may have misunderstood, and when you do come across such anime you hold it in such a high regard that nothing else can even come close, and, on top of that, you begin believing anime to be the best entertainment medium there is.<br />
	<br />
Such is the case with Sky Wizards. Welcome to a large, steaming pile of crap with literally only 1 decent thing in it: girls are kind of cute. No, seriously, that’s literally the only reason I gave this thing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199547">
        2 instead of 1. I bet that if you wanted to, you could write seminars depicting just how bad this thing is. You could teach young people, not just writers or directors, how NOT to live LIFE just based off on this anime. It packs so much ‘bad’, that if unleashed, it would corrupt the entire world and make everyone next gen Hitler. And, what’s so bad about it you wonder? Well, I already said. Everything. <br />
	<br />
Story is an incoherent mess. Plots get introduced out of nowhere, some are never resolved, there’s no underlying, or rather ‘main plot’ whatsoever, there is 0 world building, and nothing of even remote interest occurs. Story is just a huge, steaming pile of mess. Even if I wanted to, there is literally nothing to spoil. No, I’m not joking. You watch the 1st episode, and you KNOW how it’s going to end. There’s 0 debate there. Whatever underlying themes you think exist in this anime, you are wrong. And no, it’s not my opinion, it’s a fact. What underlying theme? Of growth? Overcoming your weakness? Suddenly becoming the most OP trio in the history of academy just by becoming ‘better friends’? Don’t judge book by its cover?  If I were born a dumpster by any chance, and someone tried to throw away DVD’s of this anime, I’d throw them right back out. Is there some epic plot that spans the worlds? Nope. There’s nothing epic about it. The entire thing occurs in a small city in the sky. Well then, for sure, that city must have gotten some major world building, seeing as it’s the only place seen throughout the anime. Nope. I couldn’t even bother remembering the name of the city. Nothing is given relation to something else. You don’t know who lives here, you don’t know what happens here, and you’re not even sure just how big the city is. Well then, for sure, seeing as how condensed the story and world is, it must have some mysterious, heart-throbbing plots that eventually lead to a satisfying conclusion! Nope. There’s nothing mysterious, heart-throbbing within this anime, and trust me when I say that the ‘conclusion’ is EVERYTHING but satisfying. I could write a book on just how terribly this show is written, but it’d be a waste. Exposition is given abruptly, at random times, and even when we get it, they still don’t explain anything. Who the hell are these bugs? Who controls them? Why are they attacking humans in the sky cities? Why are the human lives so important for them? How come some of them are bigger than others? Are they intelligent? Why can one of them speak? Is there the big bad guy somewhere controlling them all? How are they in such huge numbers when you show our characters kill literally thousands of them at time? How come some people can use magic and some don’t? When did we evolve to the point of being able to use magic? Where did the magic come from? How are we even using it? Who created weapons that are catalyst of magic usage? Are they a necessity or just a helping tool? How come everyone is able to learn whatever everyone else is able to learn? Is there a set number of magic available and you just use whatever fits you? You wanna know? Yeah, well, too bad. You won’t. <br />
	<br />
Art, sound, animation … honestly, I can oftentimes overlook this – and I do. If the show is gripping in any other department, I’ll simply overlook it and say ‘well, their budget was limited and they did the best they could with what they had’. But in the case of this thing, I can’t. Art is as generic as anything you’ve ever seen. Nothing sticks out. No character design, no building, no creature – everything is just … boring. And now the animation … oh sweet Satan I offer thee my soul to save me. When animators can’t be bothered to animate a character LITERALLY just floating left and right, and instead use jump cuts of said character at left, middle and right, and dare REPEAT it 3 times, you know no one wanted to do anything with this thing. Calling animation stiff would be insult to every other anime with stiff animation. When things are animated, they’re animated in such low framerate you just wish they didn’t even bother animating it. Battles? What?! What the hell was that? I get more excitement from watching bonefire burn out than this thing. Throughout the entire show, you’ll see STILL people flying through the air, swinging things in, and I swear, like 5 frames per second (it can probably cause heart attacks to faint hearted), seeing generic things shoot generic, dull-colored things, and the other things firing slightly bigger, differently colored generic things. There’s no excitement. There is no battle in this anime you’ll even remotely remember – no, not even “the final showdown”. Nothing. Sound is just another thing where the generic side of this anime just shows its ugly head, and it shows it with pride. Same theme is repeated over and over again, at times even louder than anything else happening, as if creators were actually proud of it. Voice actors are … dull. They don’t bring life to the characters – and, when they try to, they fail. I swear, Senyuu. had better art, animation, sound, story and characters. Let that sink in. <br />
	<br />
Speaking of characters … oh boy. I’m not gonna even bother listing their names and will call them by their most defined trait: hair color. <br />
	<br />
You have red-haired girl; she’s your generic semi-tsundere who wants to grow stronger and grows feelings for our MC despite treating him like crap generally. Development? Nope. Interesting dialogue, quirks, banters? Haha, good one. <br />
	<br />
Then we have blonde-haired girl; she’s your generic shy, tense, unable to look people in the eye type of a girl. She also, obviously, quickly grows attached to our MC and trusts him nigh unquestionably. Development? Haha … hahah … <br />
	<br />
Then we have our blue-black-whatever-colored girl; she’s your generic ‘I’m a goddess, treat me as such’ character who never fails to annoy the crap out of you. She, of course, also grows attached to our MC, and her supposed ‘issues’ get addressed 2 times in one episode (well, rather than ‘addressed’, it’s just shown she has them; they’re never actually ‘addressed’). Development? Man, you never learn, do you? <br />
	<br />
Speaking of our MC. He’s your generic look-at-me, pump-up, all-thee-mighty character with questionable but working methods of improving people’s skill by simply showing them following:<br />
<br />
1.	1 special move<br />
2.	Become friends<br />
3.	Work together<br />
<br />
So, all of you out there – all of you who participate in sports or any kind of group activity, those 3 things above are ALL you need to become the very best, even though you were literally the worst like 1 month before. Hard work? Why? Sweating blood and tears for years and years in order to even slightly improve? Why? You can just become friends and boom, you can wipe everyone out. <br />
	<br />
You’ve seen his character time and time again. He’s your generic ‘Oh, everyone treats me like crap but I’m actually a nice guy’, and he never deviates from that. In the first episode, he’s shown to be blown up by an overwhelming attack (I’m using that word quite loosely by the way), and I just assumed he was dead. But nope, he lived. How? Ah, who gives a crap! Look at just how cool he is instead! <br />
	<br />
There are also some other characters out there, each as generic as you can possibly come to generic: random psycho who falls in love with a girl and wants to kill everyone to prove something, tsundere girl in love with our MC but constantly throwing spiteful things at him, supporting duo of friends you know nothing about that pop up once in awhile just to tell audience that our MC isn’t as bad as everyone is calling him, and so on and so forth. <br />
	<br />
Being completely blunt here: this is, quite possibly, one of the worst anime ever created – hear me out here, okay? Yeah, there are other anime out that are just as terrible, just as painful. But, when it comes to them, you can just laugh at how bad they are. You can point at something and say ‘That doesn’t make any sense’ or ‘That’s just terrible’. Here? There is no pleasure from doing that. You’re just reincorporating the idea that you actually DEVOTED THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE to watch this. Not only is it generic on every single fathomable level, it goes beyond that. It makes generic look masterpiece-like. If you ever felt you underappreciated certain anime, watch this. You’ll not only appreciate said anime more, but you’ll also begin appreciating your life and your time. <br />
	<br />
In case you hadn’t noticed, no, I didn’t enjoy this anime, not even the slightest bit. There’s nothing clever about it, and even when the exposition inevitably hits, it explains nothing (making you wonder why was it there in the first place). Stay away from this, you’ll have nightmares.

    Back in Spring 2015, when I was looking for potential animes to watch. Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan caught my eye. I read the synopsis. It was as follows:<br />
<br />
The story is set in a world where humanity, driven off the land by the threat of magical armored insects, now live in aerial floating cities. Thus wizards — aerial combat mages who fight the insects with magical powers — came into being.<br />
Kanata Age (Eiji) is a young man who lives on the floating wizard academy city of &quot;Misutogan.&quot; He was once celebrated as the &quot;Black Master Swordsman,&quot; the elite ace of the S128 special team. However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200918">
        he is now despised as the &quot;traitor of the special team.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought to myself, this sure sounds it could potentially be the top contender for the Summer 2015 anime season. <br />
<br />
I could not be more wrong. This is probably the worst anime of 2015 and one of the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen. <br />
<br />
This is exactly how I finished watching the series:<br />
1. Hmm, the girls are somewhat cute. <br />
2. Why am I still watching this? Nvm, it&#039;s just a 12 episode series. And I still need to know why he called a traitor. <br />
3. Holy shit, this anime is freaking terrible.<br />
4. That&#039;s the end? It&#039;s over? Wait... What was the whole show about again?<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10 (I would give a 0 if I could.) <br />
<br />
What plot? What story? Who needs that when you are watching this crap!? Awesome fights with beetles!? None of that sort! Just forget about what you read in the synopsis!! No explanations or backstory to the beetles or its origin. Everything is in a mess here. I could try to spoil you but I can&#039;t, since there is no plot at all!! But, I will try anyways!!<br />
<br />
Episode 1: Generic Introduction!<br />
Episode 2 - 5: We need to train! Let&#039;s spend the next 4 episodes training for the match! <br />
Episode 6: HA! You don&#039;t even get to see the match they spent 4 episodes training for.<br />
Episode 7 - 11: Let&#039;s train! <br />
Episode 12: Fight scenes so amazing, I rather watch Goku charge up his Spirit bomb. This is how it went for the final showdown. Float left, float right, still images, more still images. Boom, it&#039;s over.<br />
<br />
There, I spoilt it for you! Ha!<br />
<br />
Art: 2/10 <br />
The only redeeming factor, girls are somewhat cute. <br />
<br />
Animation: 0/10 (I don&#039;t care anymore. I don&#039;t care if the lowest score I can give is 1/10, because it deserves a 0.) <br />
<br />
The worst action/battle I&#039;ve seen EVER in anime history. I get more excited watching 2 still images hitting each other (Even Pokemon Battle animation in Pokemon Yellow in Gameboy colour is more interesting than this crap!!) I rather watch Goku charge up his spirit bomb and go AHHHHHH for 3 episodes. Stickman animations have 100x better fight scenes than what you will get here. <br />
<br />
Sound: 2/10<br />
Nothing special to talk about. Gets a 2 because the op is not bad to me.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
There wasn&#039;t any character development other than Misora but even then it was cringy and uninteresting.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
To be honest, the first episode started off pretty decently for me. It got me interested. Then everything went to hell real fast from there onwards and you spend the remaining of your time wondering why the heck am I still watching this. The reason why this is a 2 is because I enjoyed wondering how bad an anime can get and was amused at how bad this anime is, it made me appreciate every other anime out there. <br />
<br />
On behalf of everyone who managed finish this series, only 2 things kept us going: <br />
1. Girls are cute.<br />
2. WHY IS HE A TRAITOR!? STOP CALLING HIM A TRAITOR!! JUST TELL ME ALREADY. <br />
<br />
The worst anime of 2015 by far, and one of the worst anime I&#039;ve seen. Absolutely disgusting.<br />
Overall: 2/10 (Literally given a 2 because the girls are cute.)

    &quot;Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan&quot; or &quot;Sky Wizards Academy&quot; is one of those cliche animes with a cool main character, in this case Kanata, who just seems to meet girls in a weird situation and is inevitably forced to work together with them towards a similar goal. <br />
<br />
Like said, the story resolves around Kanata Age, a traitor as everyone calls him, who is assigned as the instructor of team E601 to win the Sky Wizards tournament in order for them to not be disbanded. What&#039;s the catch? The team is utterly useless, having suffered 10 losses in a row. With an incredibly shy girl Lecty,

        a self-taught &quot;goddess&quot; Rico and a leader who can&#039;t really lead Misora, what is gonna happen? Well, find out yourself.<br />
<br />
Story wise, as most of the action/drama animes, it lacks. Work towards goal, not working out, gradually working out, big bad guy, defeat big bad guy, good end. There wasn&#039;t any real emotional attachment given to the characters, so if someone died, you wouldn&#039;t have really felt anything. <br />
<br />
Now, the artwork. I can&#039;t really complain. I enjoyed the artstyle used and fancied the backgrounds. Characters were nicely made. I really took a liking to a few of the characters for the looks, but that was as much of a liking as you can get in this.<br />
<br />
Soundwise it&#039;s not bad, but it&#039;s not overly good. The voices were okay.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. I typically enjoy these shows just for the comedy and action, since you can&#039;t usually feel the drama. What brough the enjoyment of this one down were the action scenes. They were literally so boring I went into the kitchen to make a sandwich just to not watch them. Another good example of this would Seiken Tsukai no World Break. There wasn&#039;t any real emotion behind any of the fighting. I can still say I enjoyed it, but it could&#039;ve been a lot better.<br />
<br />
If it&#039;s so cliche and bad, why are you rating this a whole 8 out of 10? <br />
Well, I am a sucker for anime such as this one.

    (Know that this is only about the anime and not the light novel) After seeing all the reviews and it being recced on my anime page I had to see it and I expected it to not be to my liking, now honestly I&#039;m more disappointed with it. I do like this anime and I think it could have been good if it wasn&#039;t thanks to possibly multiple things like not having enough episodes to flush things out that needed it or they were banking on people going to some manga or novel source where it comes from to get the money. Whatever it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203632">
        it I don&#039;t know, but this anime was something I know could have been better if handled right all the way through.<br />
<br />
1. The story - I think people only saw this as a harem sort of anime, probably because of the cliches showing on top, but when I watched this it&#039;s not really and the only ones who showed interest in the MC like that was Misora and Yuri who outright loved the guy. <br />
This is actually an underdog story like the movies some of us grew up with let&#039;s see if you can see the tropes: 1. There&#039;s a bunch of misfits with personal problems in an area that they are outclassed in by others around them and no one believes in them. 2. A badass top tier that has been shamed by his soon to be justified actions becomes their teacher due to circumstances. 3. They have a rocky meet. 4. They train in their interest sucking at first and in their personal lives to overcome their own inner weaknesses. 5. They are challenged by the higher than them antagonist the whole way. 6. In the first official competition they get into they lose. 7. After a bit more training, the team is ACTUALLY ready for the upcoming tournament. 8. They win in the next one and rise through the ranks in montage and then their main antagonist opponents are last to overcome and they win. <br />
Does this NOT sound familiar to you now? Do you SEE what I&#039;m talking about now? That&#039;s what this actually is no matter what anyone but me tells ya  because I pretty much summed this whole thing up beat for beat and since I like this kind of story I think it&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
2. The art - The art is ok, it&#039;s nothing stellar, nothing you really say is the best thing about it though I give them some credit on their use of CGI on the monster enemy from hell, it&#039;s no Fate Stay Night nor is it Rakuen Tsuihou. It&#039;s right on the average middle that&#039;s good for anime. Special note on the way they die, it is glorious to see I recommend looking at the opening episode just to see how that it. The people&#039;s anime is anime hair, faces are faces, the things I like most though is the weapons which are, like RWBY and unlike it, are to the owners design and interesting to look at, but they aren&#039;t also a gun.<br />
<br />
3. The sound - In terms of VAs it&#039;s all around fine, the background music is pretty MMORPG-like, boom when action is there, light and flutes and violins all around when there&#039;s character time. It&#039;s pretty ok.<br />
<br />
4. The character - The characters are of their own trope and cliches: Kanata Age: He used to be the best, but thanks to things happening he&#039;s now known as a traitor. So to redeem himself, he has to make the worst team of Sky Wizards in terms of grades and skills a skilled and powerful one. Despite being marked a traitor, Kanata works earnestly to help out his girls and as a teacher fitting a trope he is a good one. He has an annoying habit though in that he forgets to mention crucial stuff to people before it actually happens.<br />
<br />
Misora Whitail, she&#039;s the tsundere and after a very harem-like meeting with Kanata the two are off to bad start, but don&#039;t let that fool you. While her character may look simplistic or unattractive for some, the reason she fights and her dreams are what makes her genuine. Living with her Muggle dad and neighbors when her mom die (Disney notes taken) they don&#039;t remember her existing at all (Not explained deeper in the anime) and it conflicts on Misora and her dad&#039;s relationship, but this is also what drives her to use her mom&#039;s blade gun and become a great Sky Wizard, to be a reminder to those who don&#039;t remember her that she was great and amazing.<br />
<br />
Lecty, she has the highest potential to fuck your shit up in a fight, her only problem though is that she&#039;s incredibly shy and lacks confidence thus ruining her potential. Once you get to know the pressure she has, when you know where she comes from, it all becomes understandable. You even start to sympathize with her if you yourself have been there. Over the course of the show, it constantly puts her in what can be seen as fanservice moments, but it&#039;s a different kind of fanservice that actually HELPS the character to grow and works in the plot around her.<br />
<br />
Rico, the self-proclaimed goddess of the group. She believes that she is the perfect human being, in terms of looks and skill there&#039;s no counter. Never forget, everybody has their weakness and Rico isn&#039;t an exception. No matter how she tries to play it off, she isn&#039;t perfect, in fact, it&#039;s her inferiority of her sister that lead her into this arrogant way of thinking that gave her this mind process. Her growth comes in the form of letting her inner-self come out and being able to work with her team and getting over the loser mentality that she doesn&#039;t let known.<br />
<br />
By the end of the series it all comes to a helm with all of the characters better than they were before and on greater terms with each other and the payoff is needing to be seen. <br />
<br />
5. My enjoyment - I typically like series like this one and as I said before I like it, but am disappointed by it as well. The villains needed better explanation done onto them, one of them is needlessly made into a villain when he didn&#039;t have to be, and the end of them tournament is astounding. I will be rewatching this again though since it&#039;s still fresh in my mind and I want to take another look at it with the knowledge I have while making this review and I hope some of you also acquire this mindset when looking at it or looking at it again. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s it.

    This anime is one of the worst I&#039;ve ever seen. I quite literally wanted to kill myself after I finished it. Don&#039;t watch this show whatever you do. <br />
<br />
Story 1/10:<br />
I barfed at this story. It is the most stereotypical story I&#039;ve ever seen. The plot sort of makes sense with Fireteam (why tf is it called a fireteam?) E601 trying to become the best but they play it out so horribly that you just want to kill whoever the writer of this story was. Seriously, the plot just goes jumping around from the MC trying to get the girls to cooperate to some weird scientist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210051">
        who is obsessed with some girl named Yuri. I really hated those interactions since they where awkward and that guy just kept obsessing over her to the point of a just wanting to drop the anime completely. Some animes do this amazingly but this is just at the bottom of the bucket. The world itself also makes no sense at all. Like why do they need to make an island where the humans can hide? Why not make it like God Eater or Attack on Titan with walls surrounding cities as building a giant freakin floating island sounds like more work than building a wall to protect them. What happened to the world? How did the humans let giant bugs take over the planet? How did these things happen? It overall is just a poor excuse for a story. It feels like some 3rd grader fresh out of watching AOT &amp; SAO comes and is like &quot;Oh, I love SAO &amp; AOT and I want to put them together. I know!!! Lets take the floating island of SAO along with the weapons, and the plot of AOT and make a brain-dead version of the show. Sounds like a great idea!!!&quot; Well this is the product of that. The ending of this show is just disappointing to me although what did I expect with all the complaints I had above. I&#039;m not even going to say what the ending was because it was so bad, just trying to remember it just makes my brain hurt. <br />
<br />
Art 3/10:<br />
The animation is as I would put it, like the animators had the budget of a student animating stick figure videos and putting them on Youtube. The animation is so slow and choppy. You can really see it in the opening song. The animation is like playing COD at 5fps. Even looking at one of those old Stickman videos on Youtube or most other animations on the internet are better animated than this. The backgrounds I would say are drawn okay. Looks like some 7th grader or me drew it though. Pretty much any anime beats the animation in this anime with a few exceptions. I really don&#039;t like the style of art in this anime either. It&#039;s just bland, and there is nothing special about it. <br />
<br />
Sound 4/10: <br />
The sound in this anime is not the worst. It&#039;s not bad it&#039;s not good. Opening is one of the worst openings I&#039;ve ever seen. The song is just really bad overall in my opinion and the animation is horrible. The ending isn&#039;t that bad but none of the songs or OST would ever make it in a top video. <br />
<br />
Characters 1/10:<br />
Oh god the characters, why the characters.... (Note: I forgot the names of the characters because they were so bad) First of all, the MC bland. He has like no character. He has pretty much no backstory. He is also super OP and that&#039;s pretty much it about him, a bland dude who I forget the name of because he was that bland. Now onto the Harem. <br />
<br />
Red-Haired Girl: <br />
Some stereotypical girl that no one likes. So cliche in every way. She has some backstory but it&#039;s still bad just like the rest of the plot. If I could, I would just kill her off as soon as possible. Such a boring character in the end.<br />
<br />
Blond Girl:<br />
Big chested shy girl. Super super shy and obviously falls for the MC for no reason. <br />
<br />
Kami Girl:<br />
Just as the title suggest, she is a girl who thinks of herself as a goddess. Any redeeming qualities about this girl? No<br />
<br />
Yuri (I think that&#039;s her name):<br />
I don&#039;t know why I remember this girl&#039;s name but I think it&#039;s from that weird scientist obsession with her. She likes the MC because this is a harem but really. No redeeming qualities about her either. <br />
<br />
Antagonists:<br />
The giant bugs....<br />
Giant bugs are the antagonist of this anime? I think this would have fit in way better in a show such as One Punch Man. They barely appear in this show for being antagonist and just are horrible. <br />
<br />
Scientist:<br />
This creepy guy who for some reason loves Yuri after smelling a tissue she dropped. It makes no sense what so ever. It&#039;s like me falling in love with some random girl from smelling her skin. The only time I&#039;ve seen an anime pull off something like this is when Tsukiyama (Tokyo Ghoul) smells that blood stained tissue and wants to eat Kaneki. He has no development at all and is overall a horrible antagonist. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10:<br />
From all the given above, you probably can tell how I feel about this anime. I really hated this anime and had no enjoyment in watching it. I felt like killing myself at the end of this because I really hated this so much. There is no re-watch value or anything in this anime at all. I love plot and characters, and as long as those are good, I can live with everything else being terrible but this was just absolutely horrifying. I feel like this shouldn&#039;t even exist, that&#039;s how bad this is. <br />
<br />
Overall 1/10:<br />
Just stay away from this anime. If anyone tells you to watch this, they must have been shot in the head as they are brain-dead for even trying to make you watch this load of crap. I will never ever recommend this anime to anyone. It&#039;s so bad that it could be quite literally one of the worst animes ever created. It&#039;s on that level of don&#039;t watch because it&#039;s so bad, your eyes will melt out of their sockets like watching School Days or Boku no Pico. Just don&#039;t even attempt this watch. There is no redeeming value in watching this anime. Just run away from this anime. Save yourself from this crap.

    I usually don&#039;t write reviews on anime but seeing how low the rating for this anime was, I had to write a review. When I watch an anime I tend to watch animes with a rating of 7 or higher, but looking at Kuusen Madoushi with a rating of 6, it had me put it off for a while until now.<br />
Also, I&#039;m not a picky watcher so I tend to like most animes even if the anime got a low score.<br />
<br />
This anime doesn&#039;t really have a &quot;main story&quot; but just difficulties that they will face and half way through the anime is a tournament. <br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200476">
        anime isn&#039;t as terrible as most people said it is. It was enjoyable besides that the stories isn&#039;t as great as it could be. Everything was just small challenges or arcs and it was interesting to watch. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, it&#039;s a good anime for casual watching.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Nothing special is in this anime. It&#039;s just small challenges every few episode that they will face.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10 <br />
Just like any anime, the art isn&#039;t terrible.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Nothing too special about the sounds<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10 <br />
Besides the MC being OP, there isn&#039;t any real background information. Some plot holes here and there<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/overall: 7/10<br />
Found it interesting to watch. It wasn&#039;t as bad as everyone said it was and found it to be interesting near the end. <br />
<br />

    Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan seemed like a great anime initially, but after watching it, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that it is one of the worst animes I have ever watched. It was so bad that I immediately came here to write a review about how terrible it actually was. Lets begin....<br />
<br />
The Story: The story is a giant mess and the plots are even worse. There is literally no background story at all. We dont know what happened to Earth, all we know is that it was taken over by giant beetles and now we have magic. As for the plots, they normally come

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207609">
        out of thin air (just like the beetles) and usually never get solved. Overall, its a mess and will probably be lost by the 5th episode.<br />
<br />
The Art: Holy crap! The animation in this anime is so low budget, you could have sworn they ran out of money mid way. At one point, the characters would just fly by the enemy invaders (wouldn&#039;t even swing their swords) and they would explode into a puff of white smoke. True, some scenes were excellently done, but the majority of the fight scenes were cringe worthy<br />
<br />
The Sound: My only complaint was the annoying chanting that goes on during some scenes. It was a weird combination of the opening of Frozen and the opening song of Lilo and Stitch. <br />
<br />
The Characters: The main character was honestly my favorite. He reminded me of a mixture of  Layfon from Chromed Shelled Regios and Kirito from SAO. If it wasn&#039;t for him, I would have ditched this anime at episode 6. Now lets talk about the main antagonist. This villian is literally so hatable/annoying that you will wish you could just kill him right on the spot. Im not talking about Cell (from DBZ) hatable where you hate his actions but he&#039;s actually pretty cool. I&#039;m talking about down right annoying to the bone. The main villain was so annoying that I would rather listen the Sesame Street theme song, sang by Rebecca Black, on repeat for 10 hours than watching this stupid morphed cockroach talk about his sociopathical problems. Seriously, THIS DUDE RUINED THE SHOW! <br />
<br />
Overall: Honestly, between the plot holes, skipping major fights, bad animation, and HORRIBLE characters, I gave this anime a 2/10. Never before has an anime LITERALLY CAUSED ME PAIN TO FINISH IT!! If you dont believe me, go check it out for yourself.<br />

    A very nice and fun anime. A team of warrior trainees is on the edge of being dismantled as a result of poor match results. A weird teacher tries and in time succeeds to transform the members into a real team and such ave the ability to win matches. The only problem is that the show never explains the premise of the anime: where did the bugs come from? why are they attacking humans? how do the humans get the weapons? what is the connection between bugs and humans? what are the bugs? Nothing is explained and unless a second seasons will be made nothing

    In order for people reading this review, to get a fully fledged understanding of my relation with this anime - I will here quote my first words upon just completing the last episode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was f***ing dreadful*<br />
<br />
And thus, let the review begin:<br />
<br />
First of a short &quot;summary&quot; - Sky Wizards Academy appeared to me when I watched it&#039;s first episode only 10 minutes after HD release as something I actually had been looking forward to, the synopsis for the anime seemed rather promising and thus I had high hopes. Hopes that by the first episode was absolutely demolished beyond repair, yet to write a proper review

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199350">
        without having seen all episodes is unfair to the series and it&#039;s creator(s) so I pulled myself trough the remaining of this car crash so I could leave this entry without feeling bad or speaking without having seen all that the anime had to offer.<br />
Sky Wizards Academy also became &quot;hard&quot; to judge - as it was not one of these 3-5 min skit animes nor one of the 10 min short&#039;s - I feel obliged to give it a full and most proper review rather than &quot;It was bad but made me giggle here and there so it gets 5/10&quot; like a 3-5 min skit anime could.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s break this into the different aspects, starting with the story -<br />
<br />
- Story: The story of Sky Wizards Academy was most likely the thing about this anime that STARTED of as the best element they had. Now it&#039;s not to stick under a chair that the main story line was cliche: <br />
&quot;Earth destroyed by *Insert said thing here* (Devil Beetles)&quot; <br />
&quot;Humanity retreats to a city / cities in the sky for safety reasons&quot; <br />
&quot;Some Humans are born with the strength to fight said *Insert said thing here* - and thus named Sky wizards&quot; <br />
&quot;We are following one team in particular that struggles with that they can&#039;t get along properly and that they all seem horrible at what they should be doing&quot; <br />
&quot;In comes random hero from sometime in history and teaches them how to be better&quot; <br />
&quot;The team does not like him, then they do, then they hate him, then they don&#039;t&quot;<br />
It&#039;s nothing new but it&#039;s not BAD either if portrayed the right way with the right characters - Which is exactly what Sky Wizards Academy managed to screw up so badly. But let&#039;s not head to the characters just yet - back to the story:<br />
So with a story that ALL ALONE and BY ITSELF would be more than fine for a season, you know - some more time into each aspect of training, team VS teacher&quot; and so on, but then they HAD to go on and bring in the most ridiculous &quot;side story&quot; ever seen before my eyes and then go on and make THAT the main part of the anime. No one EVER want&#039;s to see a story starting to revolt around some creepy stalker of a geezer that takes to &quot;desperate measures&quot; to obtain his love, I mean come on. That ALONE ruined this anime and I can with certainty say that this anime would have been way better of if it didn&#039;t ever introduce us to creepy stalker guy.<br />
And WORST of all, the whole &quot;Traitor&quot; aspect. We got introduced to it: &quot;Oh he is a traitor&quot;but it wasn&#039;t even HINTED to WHY, HOW or WHEN, this made for a bunch of characters ALL over the place bringing the mood down as they all seemed salty over something we never got EXPLAINED. Sure the last episode gave a CLUE but never was there a sturdy answer to said &quot;Why. how and when&quot;<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10 for piss poor performance and execution.<br />
<br />
- Art: Where do I even start, I might was well pick out the only few positive aspects as they can be counted on my one hand - majorly the art here was terrible. The phasing was rather way to slow or way to fast, the character&#039;s didn&#039;t look lively at all or seemed as if they tried to hard in looking alive, the CGI with the Devil Beetles was so bad it had me tearing my hair out - and the combat scenes was just horrible beyond imagination or at worst: CGI animated. And when they first managed to get things looking good, it was on idle side characters or frozen frames of the main characters doing nothing - in addition a great deal of the art was bland, focused on the wrong aspects and worst of all - so poorly made that they just made the &quot;main focus&quot; of the shot a small detail in the corner and seemingly aiming for that people would look on the &quot;pretty&quot; background instead.<br />
<br />
Art: 2/10 - Since a 1 would only be in store had the full thing been in Devil Beetle CGI style.<br />
<br />
- Sound: The most positive aspect all in all in the middle of this total wreck, I did not find the songs played in the background to be bad nor good, they managed to make it suit most scenes and the mood in general. A few hiccups here and there, specially with that &quot;ping&quot; sound they seem to love. but other than that the sound department did their job and should be rewarded for bringing SOME decency in the middle of all the other chaos.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10 - It was part of what kept me going in the long run.<br />
<br />
- Characters: My first thought after meeting the main crew of 4 was as split into two halves.<br />
1: Oh lord I am already hating these girls and I am sure that they will haunt my dreams.<br />
2: At least Kirito is here to make me smile as he usually does his job well and seems to be a carefree character, which might just keep me tuned.<br />
And this divided train of thought was SPOT on. I spent the remainders of the anime in agony, watching what could have been awesome and lovable characters appear to me as some of the most annoying and obnoxious set people ever seen in the world of anime. I even had my girlfriend next to me for about 20% of the total run time of this anime, she could not hear it, only read the texting and even SHE found them so bad it was making her sick - That right there is a message when only 20% run time of characters you can&#039;t even HEAR makes you cringe.<br />
THANKFULLY - Kirito, I mean Kanata, was there all along as a carefree, funny bastard that made me smile when things was going down. doing a splendid job on holding me alive as I watched trough this series.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10 - You keep em smiling Kirito.<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment: This is where things got scary, I pained myself trough each episode with the final goal of it all being to deliver a crushing blow to it all, setting fire to the car wreck, salting the wound, I was looking forward to that during this entire animes run time. While doing so I decided to play a bit &quot;Cinema Sins&quot; of YouTube and pointed out everything wrong in each episode and this helper on the overall enjoyment as well, making me still notice all the horrible part but still being able to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10 - Finding mistakes has never been more fun. But that still does not make it a good thing to be honest.<br />
<br />
To finish this all - I would like to say that this is not an anime I recommend at all, you want to avoid watching this like the plague if you know what&#039;s better for you.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s it for my review on Sky Wizards Academy, thank you all so much for reading and most of all - For your time. If a season two for this ever is announced you can be damn sure I will suffer myself trough that one as well since delivering hammers like this is something I could live and die for.<br />
<br />
Total score roundup - 3/10.

    This is my first review so please bear with me.<br />
At first look, this anime seems like a typical harem anime, but there&#039;s a reason why harem isn&#039;t in the genres: THIS ISN&#039;T HAREM. When I first saw this anime, I put it off because it looked too much like a harem anime (the 1 guy and 3 girls on the cover), but I regret my decision because this anime is AWESOME. Don&#039;t mind the haters, this anime has great story, nice art, and nice sounds. The only part that I would have liked to see more of would be character development, but you can only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199376">
        do so much in 12 episodes so considering that, it&#039;s pretty nice. There weren&#039;t any noticeable quality drops, unlike the more mainstream anime of the summer 2015 season Ex: Rokka no Yuusha and as a normal heterosexual guy, I cannot resist the cuteness of Yuri, even up to the last few minutes when she does something thats a big spoiler (maybe not if you&#039;ve been paying attention to what shows on her face when talking to a certain someone). Overall, it was a great anime that I looked forwards to watching every week.

    Welp this is basically that same harem action anime that comes every anime season. You constantly see ones like this but in different names such as &quot;Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance&quot;, Seikoku no Dragonar, Absolute Duo, and many many more. And a lot of these turn out mediocre and but some turn out good. This, unfortunately, was the former. It has an extremely cliche story, mediocre action, and just awful characters in the forefront.  i rarely RARELY drop anime. Usually the ones I put on hold, i say i will someday finish but never this series.   <br />
<br />
Story-<br />
 Basically, this story revolves around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200444">
        an academy where &quot;devil bugs&quot; are attacking the world and students learn how to fight them in teams. Sounds decent so far right?....yea no well it gets worse. We spend 90% of the anime trying to teach 3 girls super annoying girls who are the worst students how to be better.....yea that&#039;s fun..<br />
<br />
Characters-<br />
Male MC-<br />
Probably the only decent thing about this anime. Basically, We have a Male MC who has some past where hes called a traitor now but he used to be the strongest or something. Hes assigned to teach these girls how to be a better team. <br />
Honestly hes the only redeemable character in this story yet hes wasted on this lame premise of teaching these girls. His mysterious past and personality is the ONLY thing that got me to watch this as far as I did. Still, he has his own problems and its the ones most male MCs have in harem anime and its that they&#039;re pushovers to the women. <br />
In this anime, there are a lot of people bashing him calling him a traitor and stuff and he just takes it with a smile. I wish for once people can act like people and defend themselves. This is especially prevalent for females in this and other series. A girl can talk all the shit they want or even try to kill the MC at a point (in Dragonar academy) and the MC will still act like its not her fault cause shes a cute girl. its ridiculous.  Now the 3 Main female characters.<br />
<br />
Female MCs-<br />
Holy shit if they didnt choose the worst female cast ever holy shit! <br />
-First: (the redhead) is your classic overly done, bitchy, hot-headed, &quot;i hate the male lead but randomly like him too&quot;, tsundere character. She is that cliche to a &quot;T&quot;. Plus she had some stupid story where she was forcing herself to learn a fighting style that the MC teacher said was impossible for her to improve with especially after all her years of training. Yet she randomly gives him a sad backstory and he says &quot;I can teach you it now&quot;....WTF kind of bull is that.<br />
-Second: (the Blond) we have an EXTREMELY annoying, whiny, insecure, crybaby cripplingly shy girl. Her constant shy voice is SOOO irritating throughout the anime holy crap. I couldn&#039;t stand her and everything she says or does has to have some kind of shy studdering which takes too long to get through. It always takes good amount of time for her to say and do anything which was infuriating.<br />
-Lastly: (The long black haired one): is by far the worst one in my opinion. She is an extremely pompous, head in her own ass, narcissistic girl. She calls self a goddess for some past reason and treats people like crap, acts lazy and doesnt help with anything cause of it. Her attitude was so damn annoying in this and i couldn&#039;t take it every time she talked. Most of the series she was being lazy and selfish.<br />
<br />
So yea put all these annoying characters in one story and you got yourself one huge shit show. I mean i understand that part of the point of this anime was to help them be a better team and better people but frankly they all havent really changed at all till the end even. They have moments where they act a bit better but just go back to doing what they all do. And we&#039;re supposed to like these characters and support their crap? yea no.<br />
<br />
Others-<br />
There are a few side characters but most make no real impact in this anime. There some that just bash the MC calling him a traitor and one girl whos exactly like the Redhead tsundere. She treats him like crap but likes him.<br />
<br />
Overall-<br />
As you can see i didn&#039;t enjoy this lame ass anime. Its as cliche as it can get with a boring story and really annoying characters. I mean the first 5 or 6 episodes were just trying to fix these annoying girls teamwork by doing random crap like maid cafes or listening to backstories and in the end they still were the same and still lost the next event. Then the rest was some side filler like story of this tournament and this yandere guy. I mean all I cared about was hearing the male MCs back story but i couldn&#039;t stomach watching this consistently anymore and I had to skim through the rest. This is lame, forgettable and a waste of anyone&#039;s time.<br />

<br />
Its, em, why? Why would you even make it... where do we start...<br />
<br />
Story<br />
So basically is a anime about humanity being attacked by so called &quot;devil beetles&quot; so humanity chose to escape to the sky... where they made a academy for &quot;sky wizards&quot;. The plot revolves around the students of fireteam E601. Lecty, Misora and Rico. the main character of this anime is kanata voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu also known as Kirito from SAO and Tooru form Absolute duo. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art kind of reminds me of Juuou Mujin no Fafnir with is pretty average.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
at least the lipsync is more or less there<br />
<br />
Overall<br />

    I want to start off by saying: I was overwhelmed by how much i enjoyed, to a certain extent. This is anime is beautiful. The story&#039;s good and the art has an array of vivid and normal colours. (The vivid colours mostly refer to the characters hair, but that&#039;s whatever.)<br />
<br />
So here we go.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
There isn&#039;t anything that particular stands out in the plot but, I did like the way it brought life to the characters and hinted at certain aspects of characters that seemed irregular and made for some interesting development. The fanservice is there, mostly in the changing rooms, but it shouldn&#039;t be considered all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209334">
        that big of a hindrance to those who dislike that kind of &quot;plot&quot;.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is lovely and smooth. I love the vivid colour of Misora&#039;s hair, I think thats what sold the art for me. Otherwise the art is ok but nothing particularly special for its time.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
All anime of great sound so much to comment on other than sometimes the intermission/segment/half-way-point music can play a tune that doesn&#039;t particularly go with the current mood though some anime do that so I didn&#039;t penalize it too much in that regard.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The characters are somewhat stereotypical for a group of people in most anime: OP main, someone who only cares about themselves, some who&#039;s too shy for their own good and bunch or others like a Tsundere heroine.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Despite it&#039;s flaw&#039;s, I actually really like this one so I think, to me, my score for that aspect is relevant.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
If you&#039;re looking for an anime with great artwork, an alright story, a bit of fan-service, some character development and people who fights evil bugs with magic, this will probably sit well with you. However if you&#039;re a dub person, I&#039;m sorry but steer clear. I know this review views it in a somewhat positive light but, the English Dub switches out Lecty&#039;s voice actresses between Episodes 7 and 8. Kind of disappointing but no much we can do about it.

    Hi, this is my first review :D<br />
<br />
So straight up, I’m gonna start with the art style. Although other attributes of it weren’t very good, I very much liked the art style and character designs even though they were quite cliché.<br />
<br />
Next, the characters and general story. Generic. That’s most of the what I’m about to say summed up in one word. You have the usual stereotypes; tsundere, kawaii, a MC who is cool and reserved and has everything figured out for him. I see a pattern of the general story that mimics other anime’s but I suppose it is difficult to get something completely unique these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398466">
        days. The story doesn’t add much interest to your general opinion and it does not spark much humour, tension or similar in you. The animation isn’t extravagant but neither is it poor quality.<br />
<br />
TLDR; Generic story &amp; characters with a pretty pog art style and average animation.

    The truth is that very, very cliché I have already seen it a thousand times the same and with better animation. With a better group of protagonists, much more interesting and with the protagonist who is not sad. In this anime you only see trash and trash. And when you think it can&#039;t get worse, it gets worse. Don&#039;t watch this don&#039;t waste your time watching this piece of shit.<br />
<br />
En español:<br />
La verdad es que muy pero muy cliché ya lo vi mil veces lo mismo y con mejor animación. Con un grupo de protagonistas mejor, mucho mas interesante y con el protagonista que no da

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377859">
        pena. En este anime la verdad solo ves basura y basura. Y cuando piensas que no puede ir a peor va a peor. No vean esto no pierdan su tiempo viendo esta pedazo de mierda.<br />

    Only writing this to help others have a good mind set going into it.  I kind of held off because I saw a bunch of 1-3&#039;s but It is not.  It will be if you go into it with the wrong mind set.  This is not really a harem.  He is not after the girls and most are not after him.  Their is fan service, but the main lead is hardly ever their for it.  All of his students are all aiming for something, and he is trying to help them.<br />
<br />
Story:  Pretty basic, but well executed.  No

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202160">
        jumps in logic.  Nothing is done for shocker value.  Though that is not normally done in this genre. Ending also wrapped up nicely which is always important.<br />
<br />
Art:  I would say it was rather enjoyable.  I am not really that interested in art style as long as it is above a certain threshold I hardly notice it.  This was fairly well done and I had no complaints.<br />
<br />
Sound: it was all well done as well, though the suspenseful &quot;holy shit this is happening&quot; music was always the same.  By the end you instantly knew when something was about to turn solely based on the music.  Voiced were amazing though.<br />
<br />
Characters:  They are all shown first episode basically.  You get a really good idea of who they really are and what flaws they have.  They all get a good amount of air time as they solve their issues and grow stronger.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  I enjoyed it but I have no idea why anyone would care that I enjoyed it.  I would say if you watch the first three episodes and are not enjoying it drop it.  The first one can paint a false picture.  The second kind of gets you to realize what it really is.  Then by the third you get it.<br />
<br />
Overall:  I would watch a second season.<br />
<br />
If you want a story about the weak and misunderstood growing to become strong but still unappreciated yet they are still fine with it, this might just be for you.<br />
<br />

    When you write reviews in general there is one thing that you need to keep in mind, dont spoil the story but at the same time try to give your readers a reason to watch it. In this case, i dont have to worry about that becouse you see, there is nothing to spoil here becouse there are no story whatsoever to speak of.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Kanata Age, your swordsman main protagonist is recruited by the academy to train 3 girls to fight the big ass bugs for a reason we never learn, i guess they want to conquer the world or something. So thats it, nothing more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210854">
        nothing less, you wont see more progress in the story department. I could have easily copied MALs own summery but that would be cheap. So if you can accept that &quot;training program&quot; stuff then yeah, that your story. The anime does not lie to you about it.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Did i just say characters? well sorry, not in this one. The 3 girls he trains is your typical harem trophes you have seen a million times before. Move on.<br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
<br />
The only redeeming quality is its looks, good looking girls, your typical guy with a big fat sword<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
I dont hate this show, i just dont like it. There is nothing for me to hate, there is no plot advancement whatsoever so bitching about a plot that does not exist is kind of hard. Sky wizards academy is just stupid and it does not need to even exist becouse it does not contribute to anything.

    First of all, this is not the worst anime ever, It does have it&#039;s good points, but I believe that It could be better. This is what I call the &quot;Battle Harem Flavor of the Season&quot;. Almost every season, we see a Battle Harem Anime. The plots are generally similar and characters are often completely Identical. Absolute Duo, Blade Dance of the Elementalers, Infinite Stratos, the list goes on and on. If you&#039;ve seen any of these anime, you know what I&#039;m talking about. <br />
<br />
Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan is one of these anime, but unlike the anime mentioned above, this fails to bring anything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196405">
        to the table.<br />
<br />
Plot 3/10: Humanity has been forced to live in floating cities because their world has been taken over by monsters. Nothing new here. Seen it before. With this Summer season playing host to God Eater, this plot has already been covered, we don&#039;t need two anime with the same story.<br />
<br />
Art 4/10: This is probably the worst part of the show, particularly the fight scenes. The animation is poor, and battle scenes are poorly executed and are not exciting<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10: The Sound is Average at  best. The soundtrack is unexciting and does often not fit with what is going on on Screen. The Opening is pretty good, but is not particularly exciting.<br />
<br />
Character 4/10: Stereotypical and Bland characters do not help this anime. The characters are essentially direct clones of  Blade Dance of the Elementalers. They certainly bland and can even be annoying at times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plot&quot;: More &quot;Plot&quot; could actually increase my enjoyment of this anime. It would break the Monotony of this bland anime. <br />
<br />
Overall 4/10: I&#039;m not saying not to watch this, but don&#039;t expect anything new or particularly exciting. <br />

    If anime could give aids, this would be it.<br />
The animation, background design, action scenes, storyline is so weak that you would think that the producers gone broke after hiring kirito&#039;s VA that they had to cut cost on every other department. Only the character design was pretty decent and I bet that&#039;s what attracts the mass audience at first along with the big oppai loli. Seriously, the devil beetles are pretty much just flying around and not doing anything and during fight scenes, tsundere redhead just goes &#039;ahhhh&#039; and fires a laser beam from her sword and ends the fight. As for the other characters,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200583">
        apparently the animators just drag the character across the background and make explosion circles appear. Really really bad fight scenes. The whole circle explosion thing is so overused. Seriously don&#039;t watch this anime because there&#039;s no redeeming factor at all. I don&#039;t get how people think that this is good at all much less a 10/10 rating. As to why I even watch this if I thought it was so bad, well I&#039;m one of those people that have to finish an anime even if it&#039;s bad cause I dislike dropping an anime halfway.

    Hello, this is my first review on this site, so I&#039;d like you all to keep that in mind. I have reviewed other anime, but that was on my facebook page.<br />
<br />
WARNING! WARNING! SPOILERS MAY BE PRESENT IN REVIEW!<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
For story I gave it an 8/10 for a good reason. While many may disagree with me on the score, I feel it is well deserved. For one, the anime did impressively well at fleshing out as much as it could in only 12 episodes while also not overflowing or underwhelming us with information about the series. They; introduced the threat of the anime, showed why they&#039;re

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233125">
        a threat, made us aware of the main characters and their backstories, fleshed out the relationships they had with other characters, explained plot points about sky wizards (such as how non-sky wizards lose their memories of sky wizards who die), and still managed to give us just enough. However, being that it is only 12 episodes long, there were a few things off.<br />
        For one, the Sky Beetles. They are the main enemies of the series, but we don&#039;t learn very much about them except that they&#039;re apparently really powerful and attack in swarms, but retreat if their commander is killed. We do not learn of their origins, nor do we learn of what figure head seems to really command them except for &quot;chimeras&quot; who act as generals. There&#039;s too many questions to be asked.<br />
        My next issue is that we also know very little about the sky wizards themselves. How did they come into existence?  Where does their magic/power come from? Why do &quot;naturals&quot; forget about them when they die? I have to go a little easy on the series, though, because none of these questions for either the beetles or the sky wizards are the focus of the series. <br />
        Rather, the focus of the series are three girls who make up a squad of failures, and it&#039;s up to a young man branded a traitor despite once being hailed as an elite. (He was branded a traitor because he refused to return to battle; The truth is revealed that after a very tough battle, Kanata was almost defeated in battle but instead gained powers of the Sky Beetles, the anime&#039;s main enemies. He didn&#039;t want others to find out.) So most of it focuses on them while feeding us more about other issues that exist in the anime. The Sky Beetles do play an important role, kind of, in the end but this is mostly plot driven. Granted it was developed over several episodes. I&#039;d go on, but the rest will be talked about in my character section.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The artwork for this anime is very nice to look at. The dynamic colors and how it helps distinguish background and character designs I thought did a good job at making things easy on the eyes. However, I fear I cannot go further as my opinion on art is exactly that, opinion. I can&#039;t say with confidence that it is unbiased.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Believe it or not, the soundtrack for the anime was pretty decent. It helped create the mood during several scenes. It really made me feel the kind of pressure the main girls were under, and it also made me feel excited when things were going well. However, I have to admit that sometimes the soundtrack was lacking a bit and I barely noticed it. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
The anime is focused on four main characters, as well as several other characters who interact with our main four. I have to say, not a single character felt like they fit one particular archetype. This is especially since the characters develop so well. Each one changes in their own way, and each character has their own identity and quirks that make them unique. Sure, some of them retain some early characteristics, but they truly grow and overcome things in their lives thanks to one another. Each character has something to make you care about them, and I feel that there aren&#039;t any weak characters in the series. They pushed you to feel something for them, be it a desire to see them eat their words or the drive to cheer them on. That&#039;s what characters should do, drive emotion out of you and onto them, and it is exactly what they did. <br />
     Take Lepty for example. She starts out super shy yet determined, but by the end of the series though she may be shy, she can also look her opponents in the eyes and not hesitate like she used to.<br />
     Even more satisfying was watching the four main characters grow and bond as a team, more so for the three girls bonding as a team and learning to trust each other and their instructor. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
I truly enjoyed the series. I do hope that the show gets a second season as it left a bit to be desired, though not to its own fault. This is definitely something I would recommend to anyone looking for something short and enjoyable. It is action packed, has fun and engaging characters, and has pretty nice artwork. The characters are easily the strongest suit.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
I&#039;ve said plenty of what I feel I needed to say. Good story, good art, lackluster soundtrack, well developed characters, and high entertainment value. Many may disagree with my score, but I say give the anime a chance. Come into it with an open mind, but don&#039;t forget that everything comes with a bias, even people who try to be as in the middle as possible with their reviews.
