Now the story is simple, straight-forward yet lacks uniqueness which I believe is something that is absolutely vital in every anime &amp; manga. Hundred is literally copy &amp; pasted meaning if you have watched at least 2 or three titles similar to this then you can already predict the upcoming events and the relationships between characters. In addition to that, prediction the plot along with the events that are going to take place for certain episodes is sort of like a walk in the park. Now I&#039;m not really trying to criticize Jun Misaki because other authors obviously have this idea too. They want use the re-occurring themes found in other authors work and make their own unique novel based upon those theme. That&#039;s perfectly fine however it hurts both the story and the plot in  many ways because it is all too common. This is exactly why I brought up the &quot;bad cycle&quot; theory. If I didn&#039;t watch shows like these when they aired for a while and just got into hundred then perhaps I could&#039;ve felt that the story was refreshing however, this simply was not the case.  There were no exciting story developments and plot development felt weak. Most importantly though it was pretty hard for me to get excited and engaged with such meritocracy. Overall I just was not impressed with the stories presentation nor plot because it&#039;s been done too many times to the point where I really wanted to drop it.<br />
<br />
The art &amp; animation is actually really great. The flow of the fighting and action scenes were  amazing to me. Although I could&#039;ve done without the talking through most of the battles, I was, for the most part impressed seeing the duels between characters like Claire, Hayato, Emile etc.  The character designs were pretty good however I still prefer the illustrations done in the light novel by Nekosuke Ōkuma over designs made by the producers at Production IMS.<br />
<br />
Sound was pretty decent for the most part. I didn&#039;t care for the soundtracks background music nor the opening and intro songs. I did like the sound effects I think those were pretty good. The singing done in the show , sort of like pre-game musical performances were annoying. It&#039;s like they tried to add Idols to the already unnecessarily convoluted show. I don&#039;t really have too much to say about the seiyuu&#039;s involved in the show. I think their performances were pretty good. They each delivered some pretty solid lines. Overall I was okay with the sound department not too many complaints nor praise to give it.<br />
<br />
Characters are so forgettable that I&#039;ll probably never even remember them. Hayato Kisaragi is literally copy and pasted from every other show liked this. the childhood friend romance is overplayed. The girls start to fall for generic MC kun.  Fan service, fan service, Production IMS should have at least taken the time to make the fan service look good. I would love to delve more into the characters department however, because I&#039;ve finished my review, I probably don&#039;t want to go back watch the show again and  then edit my review again to add more details. This is simply because I feel like my review based on the characters would be more like a rant rather than an actual review.  My impressions of the characters overall is that they simply needed more work to distinguish themselves from others.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment for the series pretty low. I felt like this was a title I really should have dropped however, my goal is to see every show through regardless of how &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;Awful&quot; it is. Personally I do feel like if this show didn&#039;t rely mostly on overused  plot, story and characters found in similar titles then it really could have been better. compared to chivalry of a failed knight I liked it better because even though the titles shared somewhat similar stories,  failed  knight, even asterisk wars, remained unique, had likable characters, and a better story introduction along with finishes. I felt like there was a lack of effort put into the creation of the Hundred anime. It was sort of like the director said &quot;alright team, we are producing  a new show, go watch every show with similar story, plot, and characters and copy it asap.&quot; However! However, they forgot about crucial part &quot;making hundred unique.&quot; If I asked anyone whose scene this show &quot;Hey do you remember hundred&quot; I am roughly 92.5% sure they wouldn&#039;t remember it. Hundred fails to leave me with a memorable impression of it. Overall I wouldn&#039;t recommend hundred to anyone. I feel like there is too many imperfections to this series. Hundred is about 70% avoidable, I&#039;d say there is a one in a &quot;Hundred&quot; chance of me watching this again.. I wanted to walk a Hundred miles away from my computer while watching this... okay, that last one didn&#039;t work but you get the point.. I didn&#039;t like hundred..<br />

    The last time I made a “review” of this, it was more like a first impressions… but this time, I’m going to make a full, spoiler free review of the show! <br />
This show is another one of those battle action harem shows that we see every season at this point. It’s been touted as an “Infinite Stratos” clone. I personally haven’t seen Infinite Stratos so I won’t hold that against this show. Let’s see what this show has to offer.<br />
<br />
Story (3/10)<br />
<br />
It’s hard to talk about the story of this show. Not because it’s a difficult story to wrap your head around, but because it takes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222350">
        a back seat to literally everything else in this show. Beach episode? More important! Idol performance? 3 times more important! We got 3 of them! Harem ecchi scenes? Again, more important.<br />
<br />
Here’s what little plot there is. Hayato transfers to a new school where he apparently scored the highest score on the school’s entrance exam in the history of that school. Because he tries to prevent a couple of students from getting expelled, he gets stuck battling the student council president of this school. <br />
<br />
She’s the most experienced fighter at this school there’s no way she can los- Oh she lost. The main character is that mc that is overpowered mc that we see in so many shows nowadays, but at least in this show, there are formidable foes and there seems to be a little tension. It just gets stuck so far behind the fanservice of this show that it loses its purpose.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the fanservice, it’s bland and overused. There are only a couple things this show does differently in terms of fanservice, and even then it’s just kind of me. The only thing enjoyed with the fanservice was in episode 10. I’m not going to say what happened, but I will give this show the fact that it was a little creative. <br />
<br />
Moving on from there, the show doesn’t have a clear antagonist. Every time there’s a conflict, it ends within one or 2 episodes. The only reason it takes more time is because of the slice of life fanservice. The main “conflict” is between the school’s fighters and Savages. Savages are these mechanized robots that came from who knows where and just cause havoc.<br />
<br />
These high school students are the ones who fight these monsters instead of adults. This show makes me question a few things. How do they have the money to fight these savages? Where did savages come from? How are there more always coming? Who’s making these savages? Why are they allowing high schoolers to fight?<br />
<br />
It doesn’t answer a lot of questions and that leads to wondering if they thought anything through. The show also presents a lot of ideas about its premise. Great! Possible themes that could be made for some semblance of a message to come out of this show. Too bad those ideas don’t really go anywhere. They just get thrown at you and then sit there and rot. <br />
<br />
The ending actually DOESN&#039;T leave me wanting more and left me feeling like this was ACTUALLY A COMPLETE STORY! This is something I can&#039;t say about many of the other shows like this. The one problem with the ending is that it ends a little TOO well with no consequences. That being said, it&#039;s better than a lot of other shows of the light novel genre.<br />
<br />
The one way I can describe this show, from how I experienced it is that it’s so bad it’s good. It’s one of those sit back and turn your brain off kind of shows. If it tried to do more differently, I could go back and enjoy turning my brain off when watching this show, but I can’t. I laugh at this show’s attempts at being serious because it can’t keep a mood or tension.<br />
<br />
It goes from serious to fanservice to comedic all within 2 minutes of an episode. It’s poorly executed and there’s nothing more to say about the story. <br />
<br />
Characters (2/10)<br />
<br />
The characters in this show are bland and forgettable. Most of them fall into archetypes and others just don’t have any purpose. The main character is the dense mc self-insert. The scientist is the loli of the series. <br />
<br />
The only character to have any actual development is the student council president. This was actually surprising because she started off as the tsundere of the series, then turned into not a tsundere and a member of Hayato’s harem. <br />
<br />
The character interactions range from forgettable to cringy. That’s because there’s so much bad writing in this series. Characters state the obvious, there are info dumps even though characters should know what’s going on, and the villains are one dimensional. <br />
<br />
The show tries to show off the how the villains are the product of their environment, but it’s so poorly executed and only meant to redeem them that I just don’t care.<br />
<br />
These characters are meant for this kind of series and this kind of series alone. You aren’t supposed to take them seriously and you’re just supposed to watch. This show clearly has a target audience, and I’m not part of it. <br />
<br />
Music, Art, and Animation (2/10)<br />
<br />
For an anime, I expect animation. For this anime, I got scenes of up to 3 minutes in an episode with just still frames and nothing more. How am I supposed to say this show has good animation when it uses an excess amount of still frames, establishing shots, and reuses animation? There are scenes from the show used in the OP and they don’t look impressive. <br />
<br />
The art style is also generic and bland with nothing of note. The transformation segments are, just like any other show with transformation segments, reused. There’s little to movement a lot of the times and the lips don’t even get close to syncing up with the animation. <br />
<br />
Production IMS must have saw the light novel, threw it in the animation room, and said “you have 2 months to make this even though it should take longer! Go!” This was the result. <br />
<br />
Character designs are lazy and forgettable. They look so similar to characters from other shows that I can’t tell them apart at points. I sometimes wonder if this is a bad knockoff anime to some other anime. The amount of fanservice with the character designs alone is annoying.<br />
<br />
The music also ranges from forgettable to annoying. Much of the OST gets on my nerves at times because it doesn’t fit the mood or it ruins the mood of the moment. One track of note is the OP, but there are still better OP’s from this season alone. I’m personally just a sucker for shows having 2 singers singing back and forth. <br />
<br />
The audio design also doesn’t sound good as, sometimes, I heard the echo from the recording room that the voice actors were performing in. It doesn’t sound good and got on my nerves. One performance was hilarious and annoying at the same time, and once you see it, you’ll know what I’m talking about. <br />
<br />
There are 4 ED’s in this show and none of them really stand out. When they switch, I’m just like “Ok” and skip it. Some voices don’t fit the design of the character and others do. The action scenes don’t look very good, for the most part and I don’t get hyped up when one starts.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict (2/10)<br />
<br />
This show is a mess. It really is. It’s a hodgepodge of every cliché story line ever and it doesn’t do anything new. There are ideas presented that don’t go anywhere and conflicts that don’t have buildup. It’s a show out there for people who like this kind of show and that’s it. That’s why I give this show a 2/10 on a critical level. <br />
<br />
It does a couple things right, but it’s so shrouded under the bad that I had to really dig to get the positives out of this show. On an enjoyment level, I give this a 1/10 from the show itself and a 5/10 from how much fun I had making fun of it while watching. If you want a so bad it’s good show, this is your show. <br />
<br />
If you want a better harem show, just watch Monster Musume!

    This is my second actual review so I am still new to this, so bare with me. <br />
<br />
Honestly the only reason I am writing this is because I was checking to make sure the series was only 12 episodes then saw that everyone apparently hates this show (which I laughed at because I thought it would have a really good rating).<br />
<br />
So Hundred has 3 main genre to it: Ecchi, Romance, and Action. These will be assessed at the end. For now, the usual garbage:<br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
<br />
I was not expecting much when I cam into this anime. I saw the first episode and thought &quot;oh joy is me,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221639">
        another freakin harem anime.&quot; DAGA SHIKAAASHI, this was not the case. The anime was not like...Rakudai Kishi levels of good, but it also was not Kodomo no Jikan levels of bad. <br />
<br />
Story (7/10):<br />
I know what you are thinking, &quot;for someone trying to tell me this anime is not bad, a C for story is not a good start.&quot; Well you know what they say, C&#039;s get degrees. But seriously, if you are looking for the next Clannad or DBZ in terms of original, great story, then move on buddy. <br />
<br />
The story is not amazing, your typical shounen protagonist gets into typical shounen situations and exhibits typical shounen badassery. He is part of an academy of warriors which...honestly now that I really think about it is comprised of like 98% females...like even the staff...but anyway he fights the bad monsters. Yay! Shounen!<br />
<br />
I for one like to unwind with a good shounen anime every now and then and just watch the protagonist go through his hard life of being TOO awesome and TOO attractive and grope TOO MANY boobs by accident. It is hilarious and just...so excessive in the best way possible. But yeah the story is pretty basic, 7/10.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10:<br />
Not gonna lie I am not exactly an Art major. &quot;It didn&#039;t suck,&quot; I guess would be my best analysis. Like what makes good art for anime? I did not get a headache watching it but I was not half chub every time a scenic landscape was shown. Didn&#039;t suck, 8/10.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10):<br />
Again, not an artsy guy. I said that in my Rakudai Kishi review and I will say it in every other review. The soundrtrack was fine, not out of palce in fight scenes. The opening was not bad either, but I swear I have heard it somewhere else and I just could not put my finger on it. Ears still intact, 8/10.<br />
<br />
Character (8/10):<br />
Okay there are like 3 characters in this anime, and do not let anyone tell you otherwise. Everyone else is meaningless. THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE LOVE TRIANGLE BABY!!!<br />
<br />
That&#039;s right, triangle. 2 chicks, one dude. Harem? I THINK NOT! Anyway, I am gonna assess the three characters separately:<br />
<br />
Hayato (10/10):<br />
Dude fulfills his role flawlessly. He protects his friends, like every other shounen protag, and looks good doin it. Not to mention he is dense as all hell, which is of course a shounen prerequisite. But...he ain&#039;t no indecisive lil bitch when is comes to his kokoro. My man knows what he wants! Plus he loves his lil sis. It&#039;s touching really.<br />
<br />
Emilia/Emile (10/10):<br />
Honestly I hated her in the first episode. My thoughts were basically &quot;Here she coooomes, Ms. First to join the haaarreeeemm (to the Ms. America song)&quot;. But she was SO. MUCH. MORE! I am a man who likes his romance anime, and Emilia converts this would-be-harem anime into a purebred romance. She is funny, adorable, badass, and straightforward which is a lethal combination not seen since the almighty Stella of Rakudai Kishi. <br />
<br />
Claire (6/10):<br />
Fuckin...Claire...Harvwayey (Harvey, but nobody can pronounce the fuckin V because it&#039;s Engrish). Honestly she is a good addition to the love triangle. She is pretty much the opposite of Emilia in that she is shy about her feelings but really should not be because she is hot as fuuuuuuck. The only reason, and I mean the ONLY reason she has such a low rating is the fact that she calls everyone...EVERYONE...by their full name. Every. Time. Someone shows up, &quot;ah, Kisaragi Hayato&quot;. Oh Emile is being close to Hayato, &quot;What are you doing, Emile Crossfode, Kisaragi Hayato???&quot; Seriously by the end of episode 1 I had everyone&#039;s name down fuckin pat. And the worst part is a lot of the names are European...not Japanese...SO SHE CANT SAY THEM PROPERLY. It is clearly a serious struggle on the part of the voice actress to pronounce the names that are not purely Japanese. <br />
<br />
Overall, good stuff, 8/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10):<br />
Honestly I did not even enjoy this that much until the last few episodes. It was definitely good before that, but the last few episodes rounded the whole series out so beautifully. Not much else to say, I like my romance and this anime had it in spades. Boobs were nice too, 9/10.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10):<br />
<br />
Breakdown time!<br />
<br />
Romance:<br />
The anime was surprisingly romance-based. Do not let the &quot;Harem&quot; tag on MAL confuse you, this dude has made up his mind by the end. The two main love interests (if you can even call one of them an interest) are both interesting and have their own advantages, and in the end Hayato chooses who he wants to be with, so the viewer gets closure, which is always great.<br />
<br />
Score: (9/10)<br />
Composition: 50% (meaning I thought the anime was 50% romance)<br />
<br />
Action:<br />
I mean it had action...so there is that. Honestly the action parts were not amazing. They had some really cool moments and Hayato started to be seriously BA by the end, but the fights were too short-lived for anything super badass to happen. The anime clearly wanted to focus on plot development which I was fine with. But if you are looking for a hardcore shootemup-killemup anime then go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Score: (6.5/10)<br />
Composition: 40%<br />
<br />
Ecchi:<br />
Honestly the ecchi was not really too prevalent, but what was there was the stuff you wanted to see. None of that &quot;Oh no I walked in on my classmate who looks like an 8-year-old girl while she was changing!&quot; Man I do not want to be confused about whether or not I should be aroused. The main focus of the ecchi was the big-breasted Claire Harvwayieeii, which was just... the correct decision, plain and simple. Like I said, not too prevalent and you do not even see full nudity, but it is funny and entertaining, so it does its job in my mind. <br />
<br />
Score: (9/10)<br />
Composition: 10%<br />
<br />
Final score:<br />
<br />
(9)(.6)+(6.5)(.4)= 8.0 <br />
oh hey right on the dot, what a coincidence. <br />
<br />
Hope this review helped. Helped me put off homework that&#039;s for sure.

    Personally, I enjoyed this anime. It was nothing special, but I never expected it to rise above my expectations for a harem anime. I have always found guilty pleasure in watching &quot;magic battle school&quot; type anime, even though they are all so similar. If you enjoy watching school-battle harem anime, than you will enjoy watching Hundred. <br />
<br />
If you hate watching the same tropes recycled season after season that this genre of anime uses, then take this one off your watch list and find something you will enjoy to watch instead (unless you are a masochist). Seriously. Too often have I seen negative reviews from people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221097">
        expecting way more out of a harem anime than the genre ever promised to deliver.<br />
<br />
Hundred is tagged as both &quot;school&quot; and &quot;harem&quot; in MAL, and these tags should let you know exactly what you are gonna see if you decide to watch. Because when you see the tags &quot;school&quot; and &quot;harem&quot; and read the description, you should know exactly what story will be unfolding. For those who are unaware, this is what happens EVERY time:<br />
<br />
1. MC-kun, a boy with a tragic back story, gets admitted to an exclusive academy for people skilled in one of the following: <br />
A. Mecha&#039;s<br />
B. Magic<br />
C. ESP<br />
D. other supernatural or quasi-scientific abilities<br />
<br />
2. MC-kun will be extremely skilled and powerful when it comes to his &quot;special&quot; abilities, though he might not be fully aware of his own power or how he became such a special snowflake. <br />
<br />
3. Beautiful women he encounters will become romantically and sexually attracted to MC-kun (though he probably won&#039;t notice), and the harem that forms around him will have 3 or more archetypes from this list:<br />
A. Tsundere (often blond)<br />
B. Kuudere <br />
C. Friendly but not-so-smart airhead<br />
D. Sexy transfer student<br />
E. Overly attached imouto (often with a brocon)<br />
F. Girl who has to dress like a boy<br />
G. Top of class girl who gets beaten by MC-kun<br />
H. Childhood friend<br />
I. Loli<br />
<br />
4. Various problems will arise during the season as his harem competes for MC-kuns affections, and he will be 100% oblivious to the cause of the tensions. However, the girls will resolve these tensions and decide to compete peacefully as rivals with phrases such as &quot;I won&#039;t lose&quot;.<br />
<br />
5. MC-kuns abilities will develop over the season and at the end he will tap into his power to overcome insurmountable odds, aided of course by his harem of beautiful ladies, and the power of friendship. <br />
<br />
That is basically the formula. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Hundred is no exception. So if you are ready to jump into another school based harem adventure with MC-kun, then you should definitely watch hundred and enjoy the ride, knowing it will be a slightly different path through very familiar territory.  <br />
<br />
The artwork is good, but not great. The soundtrack is acceptable, nothing special there. The characters are the same ones I would expect given the genre. However I still found this to be an enjoyable experience for what it is and would recommend to any fan of the genre.<br />
<br />
If you are tired of the same old tropes and archetypes and don&#039;t find them enjoyable to watch, skip this one and watch something that you will really enjoy. <br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Watch Hundred if you are a fan or newcomer to the Action+School+Harem genre. You will enjoy it. If you hate the genre, this will not win you over, so watch something you may actually like instead.

    Story: 3/10<br />
There&#039;s not much of a story. It&#039;s basically about the characters protecting the ship.<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
The art was okay, but I couldn&#039;t help but notice the glaring errors in the animation. Sometimes it was stilted and lazy. For example, there are times when someone is in 1 position in 1 frame, then they cut to someone right next to them, and then they cut to the person next to them in another position entirely. It&#039;s as if sometimes, they didn&#039;t want to put in the work of the character doing fluid animation or doing something in one frame. This is especially noticeable in the last

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221328">
        few episodes.<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
The music was good, especially the opening, but I didn&#039;t really like how they changed the ending song almost every episode. I think they should&#039;ve just stuck to 1 song, especially since the series is only 12 episodes long.<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
The characters are okay. Yes, most of them are cliché, but I didn&#039;t hate them. My favorite character was definitely Hayato. He wasn&#039;t your average harem anime character whose a pussy, afraid of girls, and dense. Most of the time when he was alone with a girl, he was confident and knew what to do or say. And my favorite thing about him was that he actually chose a girl.<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
I enjoyed the action and romantic scenes and there was a lot of kissing, but I can&#039;t ignore the times where they used harem/ecchi clichés that made me go *facepalm*.<br />
Final score: 6/10<br />
It&#039;s not good, but it&#039;s not bad either. The thing that kept this series from being good was the clichés. Otherwise, when the series did things that were good, it was GOOD. I mean REALLY GOOD. I&#039;m giving them a pass on the lack of character backstory since the ending gave an indication that there might be a season 2. I think it&#039;ll be a hit or miss for people on whether or not they like the series. I would like for it to have a season 2 because the potential is there; It&#039;s just a matter of whether or not they capitalize on it.<br />

    Hundred, more like Hundred % in to the trash it goes. <br />
When you make a fusion of Light novel adaptation and every single harem trope you get this kind of abomination.<br />
<br />
It was painful to finish this series and I actually dropped it at episode 7 but one weekend I had this extreme hangover and decided to punish myself for it by finishing Hundred. During that day I actually enjoyed puking more than watching Hundred and that says a lot.<br />
<br />
+ It was only 12 episodes but it felt like a 2 cour<br />
+ It made puking seem like a nice activity<br />
+ I&#039;m never going to drink that

    Am I a professional reviewer? No. So what am I? I’m the one who gives a random but my honest opinion on an anime. Someone who’s slowly getting into anime, and I’ve seen enough to give my opinion. Expect spoilers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (6/10): Savages are bad, Slayers are good, Hunters are... somewhere on the morality scale. Our heroes are on the city boat “Little Garden” and is training students to become Slayers, the soldiers with the only weapons to defeat giant Savages called “Hundreds”. Savages at this point have an odd place in the story. When they appear, everyone is on edge, but when they’re not, people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335579">
        tend to forget that they even exist. Near the end of the story, they get replaced by replicants; a red copy without the easy to see weak point and people lose their minds because “they have no core” only for them to just bash them like it’s nothing later (when the replicants don’t have their sound gimmick). The ending of the anime does pretty good, stutters but catches itself, then falls flat on it’s face. Credits. I’ll get to that later.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (8/10): I really like the design of the Savages. They are green and black with blades for hands and a single eye. This does cause a bit of a problem, though. The idea is that the crew of “Little Garden” encounters new types of Savages as time moves on. So what’s the issue? With the exception of the dragon thing (which just floated in one spot), every single one of them looks exactly the same, just some are slightly bigger. Replicants are just copies, so they get a pass, but the Savages not so much. The hundred suits the characters use have 2 forms: the jumpsuit and the full body “armor”. The jumpsuit is just a jumpsuit, but the armor is where the personality shines. Sometimes it’s a cool mech looking thing, other times it’s a fancy dress. It all depends on the power of their hundred. The three hunters have a very “wild” outfit meant to resemble the Savages, which I really love.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10): fantastic soundtrack, and I’d advise you watch the credits, as they change it quite often.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character (6/10): great ideas, most of which is killed by the “romance”. So for three of the main girls is a futile Tug of war game for Hayato. Sometimes literally. When it’s “Romance” time and the three are together, they throw out their character and hopelessly cling onto their beloved. When it’s just one of the girls, we can actually get a pretty decent look into her and Hayato’s head before the inevitable “you pervert” scene takes place. This is rare, though.<br />
<br />
   Hayato: the guy almost every girl has a crush on. He’s a nice guy, he’s really only on “Little Garden” so his sister can get the medical treatment she needs. He can be a real idiot with people (girls), though. Early on, he accidentally groped the Captain, but he doesn’t think to move his hand until he’s basically pushed off her, not because he’s perverted but because it never occurred to him to just get off her himself. This tends to happen quite often, though it slowly becomes less and less his fault and more so the “victim’s”. He’s also a variant, a human that has Savage DNA in them and can go berserk if stress. This lasts only for a few episodes before being almost forgotten about.<br />
<br />
   Emilia: how does anyone think she’s a guy? She looks and sounds like a girl, and when Hayato comes, she acts like one. The reason she has a crush on him was because he saved her twice years ago (once from a Savage and the second from it’s blood). This crush lasted for years until it developed into love. She pretends to be a boy so (A.) She can pretend she’s NOT a princess and (B.) so she can be closer to Hayato. They make a big stink about how she must pretend to be a guy, and yet she makes no effort to do so when she’s off duty. As in she’ll dress as a girl and go kissing Hayato in public. Aside that, while I do like her, she doesn’t get much development here outside the romance.<br />
<br />
   Claire: on her own, she can be pretty awesome. Taking charge, leading the slayers, she’s the captain and president for a reason. That reason shines until “romance” occurs. While the other two girls have a valid reason to have a crush, she just got groped and... it’s love? You want to know what ruined the ending? Emilia is finally revealed as a girl after a rather touching kiss with Hayato. The rest of the cast is either confused or a little happy. In comes Claire with a full powered laser gun aimed right at the couple because... love? Also aside the first instance, every time Hayato does something “Lewd”, it’s actually just her fault because she just HAD to take a bath in the lake well aware that he had to be near by due to them being assigned together. Also, water weakens her for some reason. At first, I thought it was because if she’s wet she’d shock herself with her energy weapons, but no, she can fire them with no harm to herself.<br />
<br />
   Sakura: the pop singer who owes her entire career to Hayato and his sister. This one gets the most development surprisingly. She can be a bit of a yandere (very very small amount), but isn’t actually evil. When she was a kid, she loved to sing with her mother (who died). When she sang to Hayato all those years ago, he said that it made him happy and she sang ever since. She then was forced to become a variant and was the only one to survive the experiments. Years later she becomes famous and her home was saved by Hayato. After realizing this, she relentlessly flirts with him. At first she jokes, but it soon becomes her motivation to move on. She even moves in with him just so she can continue to flirt.<br />
<br />
   Karen: the sick little sister who I’m glad is not in the harem. She’s cute and I think she can predict the future with Tarot cards. She seems to be one of the few with any sort of common sense. She suspects Emilia is a girl, she knows people just based on description, she knows how bad Hayato has it with his harem. She’s fun.<br />
<br />
   Erica and Liddy: ... workaholics with a major crush on the president. That’s all they really get.<br />
<br />
   Krovahn: a hunter who leads the other two. He just wants revenge on those who wronged him and doesn’t want anyone who’s innocent to get hurt. Along with Sakura, he’s one of three people who actually develop.<br />
<br />
   Nesat: to prevent going blind after an injury, her hundred is in her eye. She has the ability to copy other’s hundred powers with her own. She plays the middle ground of the hunters. On the one hand, she agrees that only the guilty should pay, on the other hand, she can’t decide who’s guilty. This leads to the final battle of the anime.<br />
<br />
   Nakri: poor, poor Nakri. She’s this show’s punching bag. While we can gather that the other two hunters had it bad, she still gets the worst punishment for every event.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10): despite it’s flaws, I like it. I think the action is good, and when it’s not the butt of a joke, the romance can have some of the best scenes of the show. This is either really good, or just plain old dumb fun. Based on most people’s reaction, I guess it’s the ladder. If you don’t like it, then that’s fine, I can definitely see why, but I have seen worse.

    Hundred ON!!!!!!!! (The edited Repost)<br />
<br />
So another harem, ci-fi, ecchi, mecha, romance with school genre has just been completed and quite frankly.........I don&#039;t have anything nice to say about it, for the following reason:<br />
<br />
Storywise, it was just the run of the mill plot were guy meets first girl, first meet up with guy , another girl comes to the scene and another and another. Also, the action is just a run of the mill thing where big monsters come and guy and harem members have the job to deal with them and in the end guy ends up with either any of the girls or none

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223574">
        at all . But in this case, it was the first girl gets the prize. The only thing tweak here is that first girl has to cross dress, were we weren&#039;t even sure as to why, don&#039;t you just hate that...so definitely, it&#039;s a 5 over 10. Since we are left wondering as to why first girl has to cross dress. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art, I gave it a 7 over 10 since cu&#039;z of the slutty attires of student council be it in uniform or in leotards, since those were the only consolations of this run of the mill anime, also, I may have given the art a &quot;good&quot; , but with the character&#039;s design made by Tanaka Kie about Emile or Emilie, it&#039;s a bit too hap hazard, considering that she can be easily identify as a girl , despite of being in a boy&#039;s uniform, thought at first I have some reservations about her, thought it maybe good it just not that good enough.<br />
<br />
Sound, I just gave it a 4 over 10 since there isn&#039;t much for me to say, and I may not like this anime&#039;s musical theme, there is one closing theme that I like, which is &quot;EYES ON ME&quot; by Emilia and Sakura. Also for an anime that only runs for 12 episode, this probably that has the most ending theme .<br />
<br />
Character, Ok, it&#039;s a 3 over 10, reason:<br />
<br />
Hayato Kisaragi: Maybe a typical harem guy in a shining armor, but basically a cheater, reason number 1 for the score.<br />
<br />
Emile or Emilie Crossfode: Original creator MIsaki Jun failed to defined if she is of Latin, Germanic, Normand or Saxon origin, also the latter was simply too indecisive of whether he should let the female character open up about her true gender early on or in later time, he also failed to provide with the reason as to the reason as to why she cross-dress as a guy in any episodes, so reason number 2 of the score.<br />
<br />
Erica Candle, Lowetti Claudia and Liddy Strindberg: The annoying lesbian lackies , whom I love to hate, reason number 3 for the score. Even thought they provide a comic relief for this anime, they&#039;re just really lame.<br />
<br />
Sakura and Karen, whom were the pretties and useless slayers around, reason number 4 for the score.<br />
<br />
Claire Harvey: basically a harem member that I would love to hate, one more reason for the score. But then again....or not, those melons are nice.<br />
<br />
Now the only characters I like here were them Hunters, since they really played their roles very well, of course there was also that pity effect that I felt when I saw them as to how they have to face such hardships in their lives.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, pretty much a PTW,&#039;s a 3 over 10, sorry guys, I&#039;m just a bit disappointed about such run of the mill anime and I really won&#039;t suggest a 2nd season. Also my score itself for this anime&#039;s overall is the same, a 3 over 10, so view it at your own discretion.<br />

    NOTE: This anime contains SPOILERS!<br />
<br />
STORY (7/10): The story of the anime was good. It was interesting to see how some of the main characters were in the beginning &amp; how they evolved over the years prior to the series. There&#039;s a lot of scenes with backstories (so it&#039;s not difficult to follow). Plus, there are some moments where the cliff hangers that constantly keeps us on our toes. Don&#039;t forget guys -- I promise you that there is fan service ^_^. I also enjoy the explanation &amp; how unique the crystals of hundred can be. Each crystal possesses various powers for the slayers to use

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221813">
        during their battle.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (8/10): ALL OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE SLAYERS!<br />
<br />
Hayato Kisaragi is one of the new students in the Little Garden. He gets into weird situation with other girls &amp; at dangerous times, Hayato can turn into a variant.<br />
Karen Kisaragi is the sister of Hayato &amp; has close relationship with him. She is kind &amp; soft-spoken, currently in a wheelchair, &amp; her hundred enables her to walk normally.<br />
Emile Crossford is Hayato&#039;s love interest. They knew each other in the past.. She gets kind of jealous &amp; angry when it comes to Hayato &amp; other girls.<br />
Claire Harvey is one of popular &amp; strongest slayers. She has a small, hidden crush on Hayato &amp; has a dysfunctional family with a complicated past.<br />
Sakura Kirishima is a popular idol, has a crush on Hayato, &amp; also gets kind of jealous &amp; angry when it comes to Hayato. Her reputation has inspires her fans to follow their dreams.<br />
<br />
OVERALL ENJOYMENT (7/10): For those who have known me by watching the previous episodes of Average Anime Reviews -- I am a fan of slice of life. But after watching Hundred... I enjoy the anime that has brought the comedic moments, fan service &amp; epic action-fighting scenes against the villains. If I were to compare it to another anime -- it would be Attack On Titan. Both animes share similar aspects of action-adventures where the main characters has to battle against the monsters that threaten humanity. For Hundred, it is the safe haven for students to feel safe for any incoming threats of savages.

    TL;DR: Tbh give it a try, I enjoyed it and while it does struggle and the initial uptake it kinda slow, it comes to a nice season ending conclusion. (IMO hoping it isn&#039;t a anime ending conclusion but, who knows.)<br />
<br />
So, if I&#039;m honest I really like this show. Sure, people can say &#039;I&#039;ve seen it a &quot;Hundred&quot; times before&#039; or whatever, but to be honest I believe it does well and provides much needed originality to the &#039;mecha&#039; category.<br />
<br />
To summarize, while the start of the season was a bit slow on the uptake, it really pulled it together and I was impressed by the visuals

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235053">
        and intentions/foreshadowing the director and artists were able to come up with. I&#039;m very pleased watching this and I&#039;d pay money to watch a second season.<br />
<br />
So, I guess here is where I&#039;ll go down the list on the reasons why for the above ratings.<br />
<br />
Story: For me, the story started slow but after the first few shaky episodes it was off to the races. There isn&#039;t much attention to background information which disappointed me but at the same time, it&#039;s not as bad as other, more popular anime I&#039;ve seen. I rate it 7/10 because I enjoyed it and thought that it could easily be elaborated on and brought forth in fruition.<br />
<br />
Art: The art was one of the most impressive aspects of this anime for me. The vision and design the director and those who worked on this anime had resulted in this, and in my opinion they should be proud. The visuals were great, there weren&#039;t any choppy issues or anything like that, and the graphics were up to date. 9/10 because I loved it.<br />
<br />
Sound: So, I&#039;m a bit torn on the sound. There was a lot of effort put into the songs used throughout this series and you could tell just by listening to it. However, I feel like aside from the concerts, and a few other scenes it was lacking majorly. So, this rank is more for the actual music and voice acting it&#039;s self, rather than the implementation of it. 8/10<br />
<br />
Character: For me, I really enjoyed the characters. The MC isn&#039;t a dense fuck-wit, nor is he a perversion driven maniac. The supporting female is portrayed and shown really well and to be honest I&#039;m very glad with how the relationships ended in the end. That being said I still expect a second season because.. because. However, I won&#039;t say the characters were all perfect. I feel like more should&#039;ve been done for, if nothing else, the main antagonist and the commander, as well as their friends. I feel like they focused more on daily routines and combat, with light or drastic undertoning of relations and development. So, overall I give the main characters 7.5/10 and I give the antagonists and other support characters 5/10<br />
<br />
Overall: Overall, I really enjoyed this show and I&#039;ve enjoyed other ones similar, I even had my doubts with the set up of &#039;new transfer student immediately faces student president&#039; at the beginning (Infinite Stratos was similar to this). However, as the season progress&#039;s and you learn more about the characters it becomes more enjoyable. I won&#039;t say it&#039;s perfect though, there&#039;s a lot of rough patches and ironing out that could be done. Details that were skipped that shouldn&#039;t be, and development that could&#039;ve and should&#039;ve happened. But, the ending satisfied my need of &#039;MC is dense af and the kisses always get interrupted in the end&#039; and broke the streak that seemed to exist for some stupid reason. <br />
<br />
8/10 I personally enjoy it and recommend it. It&#039;s a fun watch.

    My favorite thing about this anime is the art style. Lots of super cute girls and a couple of cute guys as well. Super visually appealing imo. Also, the musical selections are pretty good. <br />
<br />
This show has a lot of fanservice which can be a great thing but this anime takes fanservice and just runs it into the ground. Pretty much every single episode you will see the &quot;guy falling and accidentally groping boobs&quot; trope. And oh the tropes! So many tropes--- makes the series very predictable... and boring.<br />
<br />
As far as the story goes, it feels like the producers just tried to mash every anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327332">
        ever into one. There&#039;s mecha components, rom-com components, harem components. <br />
<br />
Hundred is the K-Mart version of High School DxD. Seriously, if you&#039;re looking for a very similar story then I&#039;d suggest checking out High School DxD and passing on Hundred.

    This is my first review of a show. I don&#039;t usually do these, but I do normally read reviews before watching the show. Personally, I like watching Ecchi anime, regardless of seeing rated R (close to Hentai) anime, or perverted anime like this one. But this isn&#039;t really perverted, it&#039;s just that &quot;unplanned&quot; ecchi things that happen to or from the MC. <br />
This show is another one of those battle action harem shows that we see every season at this point. Mind you, this review will have spoilers, so read at your own peril.<br />
<br />
Story (7/10)<br />
<br />
Basically, the story is set in a Earth where there is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295178">
        this technology called &quot;Hundred&quot;, where the stone takes the form of the holder&#039;s imagination. There are different types, like dragoon, chevalier, etc. Offensive and Defensive holders. It starts out with the Main Character having a flashback to when he was a child and was in the middle of being attacked by the monsters that are called, Savages. He saw blood and fire everywhere and the girl he was holding bleeding out. He wakes to find himself at his new &#039;home&#039;/school. Little Garden. He evades the welcoming committee and seems to be rather famous. Although, he escapes the majority of the new class, he can&#039;t evade his new roommate, Emile Crossford, who he feels a familiar connection with. Like with most Main Characters, he doesn&#039;t remember his tragic past all that well, just bits and pieces. On top of all that, when he goes to his freshman seminary, a few necessary but uneccessary things happen, and he&#039;s challenged by the Student Council President, aka the Queen of the school. The school&#039;s Most Powerful Slayer, Claire Harvey.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the most powerful student in the school has to teach the new kid a lesson, so she challenges him to a duel. On his third day at the academy, they fight. She boasts about not using certain bits of her power, yet is cornered when the MC is given all this power. Power he later understands how he received. Although, he has this power, he needs to learn to control it before it controls him. Now, the story goes on as a usual harem story would. Two women in his life seem to be part of his &#039;tragic&#039; past. He learns how he&#039;s different. Why he has this huge power that most others don&#039;t have. <br />
<br />
Like with most anime, this one is no different. It likes to go into a bit of a backstory, not as fillers though. It does tie in with the main story of it all. The main story of the MC and the antagonists who are the Savages and the ones who are &#039;rogue&#039; slayers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (9/10)<br />
<br />
I believe each character is moved forward in  way that they can be remembered. The main character, Kisaragi Hayato, obviously knows three of the characters due to this past. His sister, Kisaragi Karen and two of the others that you meet later on. Emile Crossford is one of them. They go through a couple episodes before Hayato actually remembers more of what happened to him as a child. But each character has a back story that flows with the episodes. It&#039;s not some random filler, but a way to move the story forward. To help the viewer understand a bit more. As said in the story bit, Hayato is challenged by the &quot;Queen&quot;, Claire Harvey. She&#039;s like the usual Tsundere that most people are fond of, others are annoyed by. But soon after, she even falls for Hayato. The only characters that aren&#039;t really looked into, or shared about much are the supporting characters like Liddy and Erica or Fritz and Reitia. But the basis of each character in the show is understandable and comprehendable.<br />
<br />
Even the antagonist, although, by the end it&#039;s a bit confusing as to who is the real main antagonist. Possibly because the second season (if there was to be one) would go into more depth about that part of the story. I see how many people would think that it&#039;s a Harem, since multiple girls fall for Hayato, but honestly, I don&#039;t see Hayato falling for the multiple women. In fact, I see his feelings towards one woman in particular grow and grow, more than the others. He&#039;s just socially awkward around women, and is pushed into unavoidable situations that most Ecchi Main Characters are.<br />
<br />
Their dialogue is that of a mecha show. But when they&#039;re not business-like, then they&#039;re how a normal dialogue between two (or more) people would be. WIth the added comedy for fans. The &quot;Ecchi&quot; part of it, is mostly for laughs and giggles, not for hentai purposes. The furthest the ecchi-ness goes is honestly groping or carefully censored breasts. Not revealing anything too...dirty. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I do believe the characters deserve more episodes to dive into far more. To understand better and to have a better story. But all in all, they&#039;re believable characters and their development was good.<br />
<br />
Music, Art, and Animation (9/10)<br />
<br />
For the animation bit of this, I&#039;m not a huge nerd when it comes to it, so I don&#039;t really know much about it. But for me, I thought the fight scenes, and all were actually pretty good. I found them not as cringy as other shows, and the graphics weren&#039;t bad. But then again, I&#039;m just an avid anime watcher, not a graphics kind of person. <br />
<br />
The art style wasn&#039;t unique but it wasn&#039;t bothersome either. In fact, I enjoyed the style of the art, and it was enjoyable to watch. The scenery, the sets, everything. I found it quite enjoyable personally. Honestly, I don&#039;t put much emphasis on it, it&#039;s not major as the Character aspect of it or the Story aspect of it. <br />
<br />
The designs matched their personality, they weren&#039;t overly powerful (except the main character) nor were they really lazy. The audio, the voice actors I thought were spot on. Although, I have admit the sound tracks for this series were pretty good. One in particular, called, &quot;Smile Flowers&quot;. I&#039;m personally not a huge fan of Opening or Closing, but this particular soundtrack was actually part of the show, it had a time and place which I enjoyed. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
Personally, I enjoyed the show. It was funny at times, majority of the times when the &quot;unfortunate&quot; and unplanned bits happened. Or the clichés of the women waking the male up, and him acting up on it. The jealousy between the female characters while the MC was shown too much attention from another female. I found it funny. The reactions and whatnot. The fight scenes were also enjoyable from my stand point. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, Anime is exactly that. A source of entertainment. If you&#039;re expecting so much more, most of the time you&#039;ll be disappointed. But if you watch for the sake of being entertained, you could find even the most suckiest anime interesting. In my case, this wasn&#039;t the suckiest, I enjoyed it to the fullest. So for enjoyment of this anime and thoughts, I give it an 9/10. Personally I hope to see a second season, but hey that&#039;s just my take on it. <br />

    	Welcome to the probably the most cancer show of the season. It is absolutely awful and is the most generic show that has ever existed. Hell, it’s so generic that they can’t even do anything original. It’s like the writer wanted to write a light novel about something good but then said, I have no ideas, hmm what are my favorite shows and what is popular? I know, let’s take the girls and setting of Infinite Stratos, get the sister from Oreimo, copy Emiya from Fate/ stay night but then change his gender and also make this the best harem ever with the most ridiculously

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221340">
        overpowered Kirito that has ever lived. It’s trash although props to this anime for once actually having the MC choose a girl. Yes, that actually happened.  <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
<br />
	This is quite literally the most generic harem anime in the history of history. Even more generic than Infinite Stratos and I don’t even know how that is possible. It basically follow this guy named Kisaragi Hayato as he goes to this giant ship in the water called “Little Garden” to train to defeat these things called Savages. Now the anime doesn’t tell you where these giant insect things come from nor does it tell you anything about them besides that they are attacking earth. It shows one scene with them coming from space but other than that, never explains their origins or anything like that. Everything else is so generic. Nothing is explained. It’s a stupid generic harem story and it sucks.<br />
<br />
Art: 2/10<br />
<br />
	Well this shows looks like it was made in 2006. Literally it does. It looks bland, terrible and nothing amazing. The show could have used a lot better art direction. <br />
<br />
Sound: 2/10<br />
<br />
	Well I hate the Op and Eds for this show. There terrible in my opinion and the ost is nothing special at all. The insert songs didn’t fare any better.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
	These are the blandest, generic, stupid, poorly written, and designed literally the same way as every other character in the harem genre. Hayato is your average MC that like every other MC, is dumb and is a chick magnet. Then we have a rip off of Charlotte from Infinite Stratos, your big boobs president (captain in this anime), the one with the big bro complex, and the one that falls in love with him for no reason. Every other character receives no development what so ever and they are all pretty bad. The villain doesn’t show up until like the last 2 episodes and she’s pretty stupid as well. Overall, these were god awful characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
<br />
	Man of man did I hate watching this anime. It was so generic and a show that people probably have seen a HUNDRED times already. It was a waste of my time to watch this and it was just a drag to watch this. Nothing could have saved this thing as it was already in the harem genre and with the generic characters that just added more to the fire that is this show. <br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10<br />
<br />
	I’m sure you already know my opinion on this anime so I’ll stop talking about that. Here is why you want to or don’t want to watch this series for anyone who is looking to watch it. <br />
<br />
Watch if: <br />
-	You like harem animes<br />
-	You like Romance (bad romance btw)<br />
-	You want to see the MC actually CHOOSE A GIRL<br />
-	Don’t mind god awful stories or characters<br />
-	Can stand looking at bad artwork and sound<br />
<br />
Don’t watch if:<br />
-	You hate harem animes<br />
-	You need good characters and stories<br />
-	You need good artwork<br />
-	Hated SAO (it’s worse than SAO for sure)<br />
-	Looking for a good show<br />
-	Wanting to be entertained<br />

    Story: so the story pretty much start out with Hayato coming to the little graden also wont really spoil out the story that much also they can use this thing called a hundred which they can use too aid them for different abilities<br />
<br />
Art: art was very good nothing bad about it<br />
<br />
Sound: again like art nothing bad about the sound with the characters or the music<br />
<br />
Character: now i personally loved the characters personally my fav were of course Hayato and Emile with everything that went on with them and what not also the other characters i did enjoy<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: now i hella enjoyed this anime for many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227774">
        reasons the comedy and everything that would happen to hayato would just make me laugh like crazy and also everything that would happen with him and Emile<br />
<br />
Overall: i give this a 9 because of everything with this anime from the comedy to the action being pretty good but just because of the comedy being over the top funny too me

    The story centers on a guy who is secretly more powerful than he lets on and his harem of girls who use magical weapons to battle...wait, that describes three different shows from this season. This review is for Hundred but there will be some comparison to the other two shows, The Asterisk War &amp; Anti-Magic Academy: The 35th Test Platoon. It&#039;s inevitable given all the similarities between all three shows. Of the three, Hundred has the best setting. The world they live in is explained, and the addition of the savages gives them a constant threat to face. What isn&#039;t really explained is the wide

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221439">
        range of hundreds though. Why are no two the same? They mention something about different types of hundred but it&#039;s of no consequence. The art is great, it&#039;s a treat to look at in both moments of peace and violence. I do have two things that bugged me about this anime that kept me from truly enjoying it. First is the amount of screen time dedicated to Sakura and her singing. Mind you, I grew up listening to Minmay and Yellow Dancer so I know when a musical concert is needed for the story. Sakura&#039;s concerts seemed like filler which is odd in a series only 12 episodes long. Second is something that I&#039;ve hated in anime since I first watched Tenchi Muyo. Three characters just throw their panties at Hayato (he&#039;s Ayato in the Asterisk War) but he just doesn&#039;t respond. It would be one thing if he was scared of girls, or had a crush on someone else or was gay. Anything but &quot;HUH?&quot; though. He could just pick one and we see how that works out or he could reject them all flat out and keep that as a running gag. But watching them throw themselves at him and not get a reaction one way or the other is tedious. I was gonna say watch The Asterisk War over this, but the fact that it ran twice as many episodes as Hundred is all the evidence one needs.<br />

We&#039;ve all seen these kinds of animes, it&#039;s been quite the trend these few years, from the ones LA will take as an example that LA watched are &lt;LA breathes in&gt;; Infinite Stratos (the anime that started it all), Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi, Mahou Sensou, Black Bullet, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (where it REALY started to skyrocket into popularity LA thinks), Seikoku no Dragonar, Seirei Tsukai no Kenbu: Blade Dance, Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de, Trinity Seven, Absolute Duo, Isuca, Juuou Mujin no Fafnir, Seiken Tsukai no World Break, Denpa Kyoushi, Gunslinger Stratos: The

        Animation, Triage X, Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, Taimadou Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai, Lance N&#039;Masques and if you &quot;want&quot; to admit it or not Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut from last season are some of the animes that does this trend to it&#039;s genre doing nothing but oversaturate the market with these bare-boned ecchi harem supernatural &quot;main protagonist is OP&quot; as hell done to death, is Hundred any exception?...well time to find out.<br />
<br />
LA will say that you&#039;ve read the synopsis of this anime, but this will bear repeating, LA thinks that this anime has gotten it&#039;s name not by it&#039;s signature weapon name, but for nearly outright using HUNDREDS of the typical tropes from this anime genre, let&#039;s go through this.<br />
<br />
*Humanity is invaded by monsters trying to kill us (Juuou Mujin Fafnir, Black Bullet)<br />
*new main male protagonist who&#039;s OP than the rest of the cast (Juuou Mujin Fafnir, Black Bullet, Kuusen Madoshi, World Break, Blade Dance etc.) <br />
**who is challenged by one of the best warriors of the school (Asterisk, Rakudai)<br />
*main protagonist&#039;s childhood friend is a girl but he&#039;s too dense and thinks she&#039;s a he (Infinite Stratos)<br />
*kissing in order either suppress the main protagonist&#039;s power or make him even more OP? (that&#039;s from Campione)<br />
*little sister who&#039;s sick and the main male protagonist went to the school to pay for her medical expenses (shades of 35 Gakuen)<br />
*a tug of war of the main protagonist with the main love interests (EVERY FRICKIN&#039; HAREM ANIME EVER)<br />
*mech-suits looks like it&#039;s from Infinite Stratos.<br />
*Trace on (from Fate stay nigh- wait what the fu-????)<br />
<br />
Seriously, LA thinks this anime just threw whatever popular, cliched tropes from this anime genre and see what stuck...and by all standards it&#039;s cliched as hell, but with the MANY tropes it *ahem* stole from it&#039;s other previous anime genre animes, it does try to &quot;slightly&quot; play against the type but is blatantly obvious it&#039;s cliched as hell. <br />
<br />
In terms of characters, almost the entire cast are cookie cutter and cliched very much like the plot, the only character that nearly felt fresh was Emile Crossfode voiced by Rumi Ookubo, she has shades of Char Dunois from Infinite Stratos and is probably one of the genre savvy character (though the main protagonist&#039; little sister is the most genre savvy) and really because of that she was LA&#039;s favourite character of this cookie cutter checklisted cliched anime.<br />
<br />
The animation by Production IMS is decent to nearly above average at best, from the battles to the character designs, the animation is at best decent and the battle animation are somewhat even better.<br />
<br />
The fanservice of Hundred is there and is rather rampant typical with these kind of animes but it&#039;s &quot;ok&quot; as they don&#039;t fling fanservice everywhere the highest &quot;level&quot; of fanservice it goes is full nudity but covering up the &quot;naught bits&quot;...so the fanservice is hardly high.<br />
<br />
The ending gives us an actually competent villain but squandered pretty quickly by changing who the true villain is, and like typical light visual novel anime cliches, the main protagonist saving his new home through friendship (no seriously) and harem hijinks ensues during the final scenes of anime. Overall the ending didn&#039;t help much though the build up to it was actually better than the ending it gave out.  <br />
<br />
Ok, LA knows that you think that LA absolutely hates this anime all due to it being the typical &quot;supernatural battle harem anime with an OP protagonist&quot;...yes it has this cliche but at the very least it does try something new, sure with an idol subplot but still. LA really can&#039;t hate this anime even if it&#039;s cliche riddled as it still has something of a focus just with the typical battle harem cliches. What LA is really saying is, LA would rather watch a cliched riddled anime with tons of fanservice than an anime that is boring in all it&#039;s elements. Hundred maybe be cliche riddled, but it wasn&#039;t boring...just &quot;by the books&quot; at worst and clearly isn&#039;t LA&quot;s worst anime of Spring 2016...there&#039;s another anime that has LA&#039;s scorn on that title...

    Honestly, nothing was all that unique in this one. It was a typical light novel adaptation and on top of that, one that has been done several times already. That being said, it entertained me, and that is what I think is the most important.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, the characters weren&#039;t unique, the concept had been done before, and the story wasn&#039;t anything special. It&#039;s a typical harem/ecchi anime though, so what would you really expect from it? The fights became pretty decent after a while, and although it seems like the story could continue, the MC does appear to choose one of the girls,

    The most common criticism I see of this show is &quot;seen it before&quot; in terms of the story; This is very true (to the point where it seemed like the writers were following a template even), but I tend to look past that with most shows because of course that&#039;s going to happen. Most peoples&#039; favorite show is probably a ripoff from some other show; what&#039;s important is that different portrayals of the same story reach everyone differently.<br />
<br />
That being said, this was not necessarily one that reached me. I won&#039;t say I regret watching it, it was a nice show to pass the time with.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221948">
        It felt like they combined Buso Renkin and Kill la Kill, but rather than a complete combination of the two, it would be apt to say that it was as if Dr. Frankenstein had put the show together using the two as material.<br />
<br />
I love when a show can have variety with powers (or weapons in this case), so Hundred has that going for it, except they didn&#039;t explore it as well as they could have (if the weapon can have over 100 different forms, then at least throw in background characters to show us some more of them). This is half of why I gave it a low score on characters, because they introduce the concept of Full-Body Armament -weapons taking their ultimate form- from episode 2, but only two characters ever achieve it (and we see those two right in that same episode); it left the other characters really lacking. The other half of the poor character score is because they all remain the same throughout the entire series: no real development from when they were introduced; no amazing insight into who they are; no heart changing moments about characters that could be considered &quot;problematic&quot; (except slightly for the hunters).<br />
<br />
When I watch an action anime, I like there to be at least one goosebump inducing speech, or perhaps a nice feel-good moment (even Kill la Kill gave me that), but I can honestly say that Hundred couldn&#039;t do it for me

Sometimes when watching a really amazing anime, I feel the need to watch something truly dreadful to remind myself what the alternative is. For this purpose, Hundred is ok. For any other purpose, Hundred is awful. <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
Some animes can get away with not having a plot. Lucky Star, for example, doesn&#039;t need to have a story, since it&#039;s a silly little slice of life anime. Hundred, however, is not. Hundred tries to have a plot sort of, with evil alien robot-like creatures invading the earth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221885">
        and a virus? The characters are called Slayers and the show seems undecided on whether or not all of them are infected with the alien virus or only some of them. Concepts are brought up but not explored at all at random, like the N-Shield which shows up in the second episode but is never really explained or anything. <br />
<br />
Art/Sound: 1/10<br />
Nothing memorable, there&#039;s not really anything I can say about this. The characters look ok but not really much different from standard anime characters. Even the robot aliens, fight scenes, and transformation sequences are visually unimpressive. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
Every character is a trope. Generic anime protagonist, blonde drill-haired tsundere rich girl, childhood friend love interest, hospitalized little sister whose body is weak because of an unidentified illness, pop idol with a thing for the main character, etc. Hundred introduces a bunch of characters and only really expands on three of them. Of those three, only one goes through any character development and it&#039;s a problem that&#039;s introduced and then fixed in the span of a couple minutes, which is, incidentally, how the anime deals with the majority of the problems that crop up. Even the main villain is only ever mentioned until the final episode, and her motivations are laughably pointless. With only 12 episodes to its name, Hundred can&#039;t possibly work through all the characters it foolishly throws out. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10 <br />
I laughed a few times, though most of the time when that happened, it was immediately followed by a shake of the head, a sigh, and a &quot;my god this anime is awful.&quot; <br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
Overall, Hundred is a slog, barely even fit for what I wanted out of it. It succeeded at reminding me what a bad anime looks like so I can better appreciate the good ones, but looking back I realize there are other bad anime out there that would fulfill the job better. The main character is so remarkably forgettable that I think I&#039;ve already forgotten his name as I write this. I actually had to look at the synopsis to remember that his name is Hayato. Near the end I wanted so badly to drop the show but I didn&#039;t for the sake of this review. Hundred is terrible. <br />
<br />
Final Episode: 1/10<br />
I think in this particular instance the final episode deserves its own section because it is truly baffling. I don&#039;t think I can do this section without spoilers, so I&#039;ll put this large <br />
[SPOILER ALERT}<br />
right there. <br />
Anyway, the finale has a number of oddities. The main villain invades the school, but is killed by a background character who was supposedly using her, even though his plan seems to have been able to work regardless of her presence. He vaguely mentions that he has some plans but he never shows up again after this scene, so on the off chance that this travesty gets a second season, I suppose we&#039;ll see what that was about. As it stands, it&#039;s weird and irrelevant. So while the villain herself didn&#039;t actually do anything before getting killed, she did apparently activate a bunch of robots to turn into exploding bees, who try to latch onto power stations and explode. They do so but nothing really happens, the ship keeps its power, there&#039;s still a barrier up, and all the civilians are safe. There doesn&#039;t seem to be any reason for the exploding bees to exist. Seriously they supposedly put on the auxiliary power, which turns all the lights red to indicate that they&#039;re on backup power, but then the lights go back to normal in the next scene and it&#039;s never mentioned again. Later on, a magical super powered girl shows up and cures the main character&#039;s sister of her illness by touching her. Yep. Lastly, the final, climactic moment was between the main character and some girl he had no interaction with beforehand. He introduced himself to her in that scene with his full name. I think the writers were just as tired of this series as I was by this point because nothing makes sense and it seems to just wrap up because it was the time to do so. The villain introduces super alien robots with no weak points but then the main characters just beat them back as easily as they do the other ones while exclaiming &quot;wow it&#039;s really hard without weak points.&quot; What was the point of introducing these enemies if all they&#039;re going to do is change the dialogue a bit? <br />
[SPOILERS END]<br />
So that&#039;s the final episode of Hundred. If you can sit through the first 11 episodes, I recommend watching this thing just so you can experience the weirdness that is this finale. Of course, it&#039;s not a good anime by any stretch of the imagination, it&#039;s not even a good trainwreck anime like Big Order, but it&#039;s... uh... something.
