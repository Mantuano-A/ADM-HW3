    Greetings, commoners. It is I, Emilie De Rochefort the Great. Due to the informal situation, you may call me Lili. <br />
As many of you have no doubt noticed, Namco made the very questionable decision to omit me from the CGI feature &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot;. Instead, they offered me to watch and review it for this particular website, an offer I graciously accepted.<br />
Now, many (or all) of you may find my omission from this movie to be highly alarming. After all, I am the main character of the Tekken franchise, and the entire plot revolves around me and my exciting exploits. But I suppose that some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47665">
        fans of the series would enjoy seeing the side characters get 93 minutes in the limelight.<br />
Now, without further ado, let us get to the bottom of things. Sebastian, bring our guests some chairs. We&#039;ll be here for a while.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around some high school girl I don&#039;t know being hired by some evil corporation to spy on a strapping young lad named Shin Kamiya, whom you may know from the hit Tekken spin-off: A Certain Ridiculous Plot Device. Hm? What&#039;s that? Shin wasn&#039;t actually in any of the games and was just created for the sole purpose of being a generally unimportant non-character to fill empty spaces in promotional images? O-of course I knew that! I was just testing you. And you passed! G-good job! <br />
Sebastian, shut down the Tekken Wiki for feeding me false information!<br />
Anyway, none of this is actually important, as it is simply pointless build-up to a highly ridiculous finale where a father and his beloved son turn into dragons and start firing laser beams at each other.<br />
And no, it doesn&#039;t make any more sense in context.<br />
<br />
The main flaw of the story is that plotlines are frequently picked up and then unceremoniously dropped mere moments later. Was Shin Kamiya actually relevant to anything ever? Was there a point to the whole Xiaoyu and Alisa friendship story? Was the convenient ancient power buried under some castle ages ago that the villain used to fashion a giant mecha made of wooden statues ever explained or given any foreshadowing whatsoever?<br />
The answer to all of those questions, children, is no. None of the characters have their personalities fleshed out, and none of their motives nor objectives were ever clearly explained. Indeed, my presence would have greatly improved this vulgar display of plotting incompetence. I might even go so far as to say that I would have come up with a much more satisfying story.<br />
<br />
But enough of that. Did I ever mention that I have a beautiful singing voice? In fact, my debut single, &quot;I Am Wonderful (And You Wish You Were Me)&quot; is available for download at bTunes right now. I do believe your life would be greatly improved by purchasing and listening to said work of musical art.<br />
Speaking of voices, that is something I found myself to be mildly delighted with in regards to this production. The English cast (I did not feel like forcing myself through this a second time to form an opinion on the Japanese audio track) includes a plethora of well-known names, many of which did a very competent job on conveying the very flawed script.<br />
The soundtrack was more or less what one would expect from my humble franchise, with generic techno and rock pieces playing over the fight scenes.<br />
<br />
Ah, the fight scenes. Indeed, one of this movie&#039;s greatest strengths is the animation. The fight choreography is elaborate and the CGI is, in general, very pretty. Obviously, my very graceful fighting style would have worked wonders in attracting moviegoers, and I would of course have won all the fights. There is no fighter in this world who would even hope to stand a chance against fabulous moi. Would you perhaps like to watch a demonstrative film of my eloquent fighting moves? Sebastian, prepare the projector. We must make sure to entertain our loyal audience.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the topic, though I would rather not do so, I  suppose this feature could be described as &quot;all style, no substance&quot;. The action is fast and stylish, but the storyline is, to put it in vulgar terms, an absolute mess of biblical proportions. <br />
Actually, everyone who has already watched this movie is in agreement that me taking on the star role would have made the entire production at least eight times better. I know it&#039;s true because I read it on the &quot;inter-web&quot;. As a modest lady, I cannot flat-out state that I think the same, but let it be known that I do, and that the primitive minds at Namco have committed an act comparable to inefficiently slicing off their own heads with wooden spoons by refusing me a role in this utter travesty.<br />
<br />
Sebastian, get Producer Harada on the phone and tell him that I will not stand for any more of this nonsense. I think it&#039;s time that he learned his rightful place in the world.<br />
<br />
Oh? You&#039;re still here? I advise you to stay away from this sordid trainwreck, as it is nothing but a load of nonsense peppered with occasional overblown battle scenes. Namco seem to have realised their mistake, as they are now preparing a full TV anime series by the name of &quot;Magical Fighter Lili II: Saving The World With A Smile ~A Tekken Story~&quot;. I am certain that it will be the most popular show of the Summer 2015 season.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s time for my afternoon tea. Farewell.

    Ah... where to begin?  The nonsensical plot?  The horrendous dialog?  The non-existent character development?  If it weren&#039;t for the gorgeous 3D visuals of the movie it would be a complete and utter failure.  <br />
<br />
Harada and Sato&#039;s mission to create an accessible and enjoyable Tekken film for non-Tekken fan falls flat on its face.  Only someone with a flawless understanding of the Tekken lore could understand how this movie makes sense.  With only a passing knowledge of the Tekken story line, it&#039;s very difficult to understand where this fits and why it was necessary.  <br />
<br />
The story of two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40063">
        rival corporations, G-Corp run by Kazuya and Mishima Zaibatsu run by Jin, both vying to control the M-Gene makes absolutely no sense.  Their reason for hunting for this mutation is never clearly explained and by the end of the film is not even relevant, as that plot-line gets completely abandoned in favor of a flashy ending fight scene.  It&#039;s not an understatement to say that nothing about this film makes any sense.<br />
<br />
Those hoping that some snappy and thought provoking dialog saves a sinking story should abandon those hopes.  The dialog is legitimately laughter inducing for all the wrong reasons.  With lines like &quot;sometimes you have to fail to succeed,&quot; it sounds as though every line from this film was pilfered from a budget store greeting card.<br />
<br />
As far as character development, there honestly isn&#039;t any.  The characters are as one-dimension and static as possible.  Their motivations are never clear and even if they were, the incomprehensible plot would make them impossible to understand.<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s one thing positive to say about this film, it&#039;s that it is absolutely gorgeous.  The CG-animation is in a league of its own.  Relatively realistic facial and body animations and well choreographed fight scenes make the movie a joy to look at, at the very least.  The film probably would have been better off abandoning any plot or character related scenes and just presenting itself as a long montage of fight scenes to showcase the beautiful animation and jaw-dropping 3D effects.<br />
<br />
Despite this meager success, the film even fails to deliver to dedicated Tekken fans as only a fraction of the cast makes an appearance.  The cast of this movie will certainly seem adequate to die hard Xiaoyu or Alisa fans, but the fact that Sato couldn&#039;t even add a few random cameos for some other fan favorites is downright sad.<br />
<br />
This movie doesn&#039;t appeal to anyone, even diehard Tekken fans will be immensely disappointed.  And those without an encyclopedic knowledge of the Tekken lore will be absolutely lost.  Even taking into account the amazing animation and 3D tech used in the film, it might be wise to wait until it&#039;s featured in another film that can deliver on other merits besides simply being a technological marvel.  The fact that Harada and Sato put their name to this is astonishing, but don&#039;t be fooled, this movie totally sucks.  Avoid at all costs.

    Whoever composed the trailer for this film deservers some sort of award for editing, because i for one was whole-heartedly anticipating this film a great deal.<br />
<br />
Given the sheer amount of characters and character turnover, and the fact we&#039;re now approaching the 6th generation of games, the story has been somewhat of a shambles for some time. That said they do attempt to the focus the story on a handful of cast members, with the odd cameo appearances from Tekken regulars. <br />
Xiaoyu, Jin, Kazuya, Anna and Nina make up the main stays, joined by newcomer from the most recent game Alisa Bosconovitch.<br />
Xiaoyu is recruited by Anna

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52937">
        on behalf of Kazuya to investigate Shin a former class mate of Jin&#039;s. I frankly have lost track of if she&#039;s still looking for Jin as was the case at some point, but i assume this to be her motivation for going along with this.<br />
The story was, even by Tekken standards pretty terrible, poorly constructed and largely unnecessary, the story merely serves to gather all the characters behind the scenes together for big show down, rendering the leads as little more than spectators.<br />
<br />
The CGI doesn&#039;t seem to have made any real progress from the first Final Fantasy film. It generally all looks very nice, and the action scenes flow very well and look highly impressive, but they&#039;ve still got a long way to go with the character models. Xiaoyu looks down right creepy at times, any time they attempt to animate anything facially the whole process falls down horribly, and looks terrible and often deformed. Alisa came out better, but there&#039;s still plenty of off moments. Claire Redfield&#039;s model in Biohazard: Degeneration single handedly destroyed the film for me, and with that setting the bar pretty low the efforts here have not done much better.<br />
<br />
Xiaoyu and Alisa&#039;s friendship in the film actually worked for me and was one of the better aspects of the film. I&#039;d not learnt anything of Alisa from the last game, but her voice acting was good and most of her scenes with Xiaoyu were enjoyable. The rivalries between Jin and Kazuya and Nina and Anna also feature heavily as a secondary focus, none are fleshed out in any meaningful manor, but this was clearly aimed at existing fans, so entirely forgiveable. <br />
<br />
Now i doubt many people expected much from the story, so what about the fights? The answer is very hit and miss. All the early action is very average, Xiaoyu and Alias&#039;s mid way fight was probably the high point for me, with the end 3 way show down being hugely disappointing, although i did enjoy getting to see all the devil forms in action. There&#039;s allot of wasted potential here, I&#039;d have enjoyed nothing more than seeing Jin and Kazuya go at it as often as possible, there&#039;s a total lack of focus, or downright epicness to the fights, i was left feeling largely unsatisfied and would have no real desire to re-watch any of the sequences, there just not that technically good.<br />
<br />
Overall there&#039;s just allot of wasted potential, i get that they couldn&#039;t do anything to drastic to the Tekken universe, but the fights we did get were just hugely underwhelming, the story wasn&#039;t well thought out and there&#039;s not allot to praise, i can&#039;t help but wish one of these game film adaptation&#039;s would adapt the actual game material, the events between Tekken 2 and 3 would have made for an excellent story, hint hint.

    When I hear Tekken, I remember those days when I has a PS2 and mashed buttons till my fingers wore out.<br />
This is the only reason I bothered to watch this anime.<br />
<br />
To those who haven&#039;t played any of the games and those who have an interest in the series - don&#039;t bother watching this. If you want to know why read on. <br />
<br />
I never had any great expectations whatsoever from this anime but I had some standards.<br />
<br />
- Special effects<br />
- Lots of characters from the franchise <br />
- Good action scenes<br />
- And Identifiable moves.<br />
<br />
None (except the first which should have been a given) were satisfactory.<br />
<br />
I never expected any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156299">
        deep plot twists or even a coherent story-line and thus  shall refrain from passing judgement on this aspect. <br />
<br />
Ah, the fight scenes. I got so pumped up when the characters entered their stances but in the end nothing happened.Nothing.<br />
The fight btw Anna and Nina was satisfactory though as you could identify moves and even if you didn&#039;t know them, you would still get a good show. <br />
The fight scenes would follow this sequence - <br />
<br />
1) Stare<br />
2) Trade a few light shots to &quot;test the waters&quot;.<br />
3) Characters get serious and enter some stance at which point you suddenly get exited<br />
4) They execute one move and break out of stance<br />
5) Pointless conversation follows.<br />
<br />
Some scenes get so ridiculously blown out of proportion that you wonder if you&#039;re watching a Dragonball flick(in more ways than one).<br />
<br />
I counted ten characters ( plus one if you want ). Out of more than 50 they put ten. Enough said.<br />
<br />
Even with such low expectations I was utterly disappointing with this movie. <br />
On a side note if they had shown Hwoarang&#039;s face I wouldn&#039;t have been this harsh:-) .

    This is my first review, so please, bear with me if I do something wrong. <br />
Introduction:  I’ll try to write this review from points of view of both, Tekken fans and people that barely heard of it. There isn’t much of a story summary on MyAnimeList right now, so I’ll write something short. For people that know Tekken, they need only to know that the infamous grandfather, father, son trio is at it once again. For others, keep reading.<br />
<br />
Summary:  The main character is Ling Xiaoyu (side character in games) who is given a mission from G-Corp to spy on a certain guy called

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48229">
        Shin Kamiya. They first meet when he tries to jump of a building and is saved by her. Soon after, she meets a strange girl, Alisa, who claims to have a crush on Shin. It all seemed like an easygoing, slice-of-life I’d never watch at this point but I can assure you, it’s anything but that.<br />
<br />
Story:  6/10<br />
First of all, you don’t need to have huge previous knowledge of Tekken in order to truly enjoy the story. The most important things are either stated outright or hinted at so obviously that you’d have to be drunk and play a video game while watching it not to get it. The only thing you need to know is that Kazuya and Jin don’t like each other. But that’s rather obvious, I guess. Plot was really interesting, something like a mix between a mystery and a slice-of-life at first, turned into an action packed piece very fast. Fortunately, it wasn’t fast enough to get lost in it. The main focus is on G-Corp (read: Kazuya Mishima) and Mishima Zaibatsu (read: Jin Kazama) fighting for… well… even they forgot what they were fighting for at the end, what mattered to them was that they were fighting.<br />
<br />
However, nothing is perfect and also this story suffers at the quality level. Although I liked it, the plot holes destroyed the atmosphere for me. There are too many important things left unexplained and many other forgotten (The whole thing with Shin.) that should have at least left the characters wondering what happened. Instead, it felt that the scriptwriter didn’t bother finishing it and gave all characters loss of short-term memory.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
One of the most appealing things for me was that the story focused on Xiaoyu and Alisa (originally side characters).  Despite the huge majority (read: all but one) of characters being from Tekken games, it also brought something new into the Tekken world a completely original character Shin Kamiya. He is the one everything and everyone is focused on (although they forget about him very fast when they get a chance) and plays that role very good. This seemingly emo boy with a dark past and a bad habit of jumping from buildings proved to be something more very soon and got deeply involved in a certain family quarrel. I really enjoyed the brand new character as it gave the film a mysterious feeling.<br />
<br />
The two main characters, Alisa and Xiaoyu, turned out to be good leading characters even though they had very little (if any) interactions in the games. The dynamics between the at first clueless cute pink haired girl and the panda owner (no kidding) that had to hide her purpose at the school was very interesting form the start to the end partly because their relationship changed over time as they both found out the deepest secret of the other. The changes were very fluent despite going from rivals in love to enemies to close friends within a few minutes.<br />
<br />
All other characters are perfectly portrayed in the film compared to the games and talking about them too much would just spoil it for non-Tekken fans and be a bore for Tekken fans. I can assure you that you’ll be able to tell importance and nature of nearly everyone after one scene with them.<br />
<br />
The only problem I had with the characters was that they were quite easy to predict if you knew them and many of them had a few cliché scenes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
I, personally, really enjoyed the sound because it fit perfectly to the scene, whether it was a fight or a gloomy moment. It went along with what was going on adding to the atmosphere very nicely. However, I don’t consider the score to be anything spectacular on its own.<br />
<br />
Animation: 9/10<br />
Animation was amazing and as fluent as it could be. Fancy effects were nearly everywhere so that even a water drop felt like art. Battle scenes were a true highlight of the animation because nearly everything (besides the usual Tekken exaggerations) felt real. There was something that felt overdone here and there (Xiaoyu’s sinister glare that was supposed to be a teasing grin) but that could be just me. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  6/10<br />
Battles were amazing just as the Alisa and Xiaoyu duo, however the story destroyed it or me. It really felt as if the scriptwriters gave up at the end, being unable to fit everything into the hour and a half and decided to forget about it in favor of cool and flashy battles (fortunately they were cool and flashy).<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
This film isn’t bad. It’s actually quite good but I don’t advise you to watch it unless there’s a certain hook for you there, ideally being a fan of Tekken as knowledge of what’s going on only helps. Actually, knowing at least a little about Tekken and enjoying it is enough. Watch this if you like action and epic fighting scenes but don’t expect a complicated plotline where eventually everything gets explained. If possible, forget about the whole story when all characters do and pretend it never happened, the film is truly amazing and nearly flawless when you do that.

    Anybody who&#039;s into the games, like myself, knows the annoyance of the tiny personal storylines, conbined with the major plot, then ending with a cliffhanger at the conclusion of each game - which means we must wait another four or so years for another snippet of the story - a tedious cycle! <br />
Does this movie fill in any holes... <br />
NO!!!<br />
If you are a fan of the Tekken video games and you hope this will do the popular series justice as an adaptation - you may be dissapointed.<br />
If you think this movie will provide you with some anwsers the games have yet to deliver - you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48407">
        though wrong!<br />
<br />
Story...<br />
We have a bait-and-switch situation - Nina and Anna kick the film off with their (in)famous sisterly scuffles, which is easily the best fght scene of the file (IMO) and a very familar sight, however, things then change...<br />
Xaioyu is main, she&#039;s pretty much &#039;normal school girl&#039; who&#039;s roped into a sticky stiuation - she knows a bit about the conspiracies surrounding the main Mishima.<br />
Xaiyou is pretty much accompanied by Arisa (from the most recent game) as trouble unfolds.<br />
The Mishima family are at odds with eachother and still very much into  bio&#039; experimentation.<br />
^This is the premisis of it really.<br />
<br />
Character...<br />
Instead of focusing on the Mishima/Kazama&#039;s that pretty much headline the games, the lead is... <br />
&#039;Cute, innocent schoolgirl&#039; Xaioyu.<br />
&#039;Cute, innocent, (for convenient reasons) schoolgirl&#039; Arisa.<br />
A mystery, special, smug, bishounen new teen boy who fancies his odds against the &#039;big tough&#039; leading guys of Tekken.<br />
Other then that, we have breif (breif being a problem) appearances from fighting sisters Nina and Anna, a few charcters who don&#039;t get too much attention in the game (such as Lee) playing roles such as teachers in order to incorporate the token &#039;familar face&#039;, a little bit of the Mishima family united.<br />
The large cast, in general, don&#039;t get a look-in - dispite this movie being an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
Art...<br />
The action is decent... <br />
The graphics aren&#039;t quite of the video game quality - not as too bright in picture and a bit of a misty tone (i.e. not crisp ckear), but still, quite fluid in motion, and everyone is pretty.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment...<br />
None really - a massive dissapointment and a chore to watch.<br />
If I forget this is an adaptaion of a series I have invested time and money into and see it as a stand alone film (which it pretty much is), suprisingly, this makes things worst!!! <br />
It is only the link to the games that boosts this series up to mediocre, as it gives zero plot and outsider could follow; the material given is minimal - like a lousy fanfiction that has spun 20 chapters from a basic premisis - so shallow in nature it would be lucky to attract an independent fanbase or attract newbie&#039;s to the games.<br />
<br />
Overall...<br />
A waste of time frankly - even the fight scenes feautre little &#039;action&#039; - meaning you could re-create a more action packed scrap in the game.<br />
<br />
The choice of characters and the situations they where is appeared to be a delibrate attempt to make this as &#039;youthful&#039; as possible - &#039;the beautiful bishounen&#039;s and bishoujo&#039;s&#039; and school situations that may appeal to the impressionable who can fanboy and fangirl over the &#039;attractive, young* and in action&#039;.<br />
I could complain about not utilising the  many characters Tekken has, but taking into consideration what I have stated directly above, there&#039;s no point highlighing it, I&#039;m sure certian others may not fit in with the notion of &#039;typical shounen&#039;.<br />
<br />
On a hole - this entire movie could easily have been condensed into 20 minutes of decent material.<br />
If you aren&#039;t familar with the series in general - spend this hour and a half of your life elsewhere! <br />
Trust me - this movie doesn&#039;t hardly justifies advertising purposes.

    Screw the Plot, I have ACTION!!<br />
<br />
or, so i&#039;d like to say. but unfortunately, this one wasn&#039;t that good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 3/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s basically about two fathers and two sons who all go hunting... for power, and people get caught in between. yeah, a really unique plot, i must say. but aside from that, how it was told in this movie was pretty bad.<br />
<br />
there are no plot holes, because it&#039;s a pretty simple plot... though a big problem it suffers is people suddenly recovering or powering up because it&#039;s convenient to the plot. In other words, [Ending Fatigue]<br />
<br />
EDIT: eh, seems like there ARE plot holes here. i just didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48335">
        catch them because of the sheer incomprehensability of the story.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
<br />
Well to summarize, it&#039;s got:<br />
<br />
Pretty Girls and Pretty Boys. Nina and Xiaoyu stand out for the girls.<br />
[She&#039;s Got Legs] focused a lot, for a good reason.<br />
[Ridiculously Cute Critter] a Panda<br />
[Uncanney Valley] each character occasionally sports weird facial expressions and move awkwardly. [EDIT] the production team probably didn&#039;t have the non-action scenes mo-capped.<br />
<br />
(if you have no idea what the words in [brackets] mean. look them up in TVTropes.org)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
Nothing really epic here. but most music fits the scene it&#039;s used on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
<br />
Ugh, where to start? If you never played the games or know the back story everyone here would be a [Flat Character], or close to one. also, very little is done to develop the characters. No [Hidden Depths] are delivered.<br />
<br />
[Exposition] of character details are pretty in-your-face and unsubtle. and you wouldn&#039;t know who&#039;s controlling who or why a character does something if you don&#039;t have prior knowledge about the character.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10<br />
<br />
The fight scenes are great. too bad they&#039;re too few for an adaptation of a fighting game. this could have been better if the entire movie was full to the brim of fight scenes;<br />
<br />
or if it had the story is told along with the fight scenes. also, badly done [Chekhov&#039;s Skill] and ridiculously convenient power-ups ( major offending case: [I Am Not Left Handed] ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall 5/10<br />
<br />
It could have had potential even with it&#039;s simple plot. had they spice up the music, CG, and characterization.

    Everyone in the cross section between the fandoms of Tekken and anime probably knows of the legendary turd that is the &quot;Tekken&quot; anime. If they don&#039;t, chances are they spent a lot of money in therapy to suppress the terrible memory. <br />
<br />
Over a decade later, Bandai Namco probably figured that to leave &quot;Tekken&quot; as the sole anime representation of the franchise is akin to leaving a shit stain smeared across the company logo, so they decided clean things up by green lighting &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot;. This time, you know they mean business, cos it involves people who actually worked on the Tekken games: the studio

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303464">
        that produced some of the cut scene animation, and even the head honcho of the Tekken games himself, Katsuhiro Harada.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be honest: &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; is not a great movie; it&#039;s not even a good one. However, it scratched enough of my Tekken itch to leave me oddly satisfied. As a hardcore fan of the games, I think the movie captured the essence of Tekken, and I&#039;m happy to have it represent the franchise in anime.<br />
<br />
The thing about &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; is that it gets the important stuff right.<br />
<br />
Characters are recognisably from Tekken? Check.<br />
<br />
This might strike you as setting the bar rather low, but if you&#039;ve seen the other Tekken anime, you&#039;ve probably uttered the words &quot;who the fuck is that meant to be&quot; and you&#039;ll know not to take this for granted. Given Tekken&#039;s 3D roots, the decision to have the whole movie in CG is a canny one. The whole thing looks like polished up cut scenes from the latest games. And as far as I&#039;m concerned, that&#039;s perfect.<br />
<br />
Great fights? Check.<br />
<br />
Again, this may seem like setting the bar low, but an astonishing number of fighting game adaptations fails to clear this hurdle. &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; hits multiple home runs when it comes to the fights. The action is riveting, with characters striking one another with bone crunching blows. A friend of mine who also likes Tekken said he didn&#039;t rate the action very highly because it felt like they were punching through brick walls. I agree with that description, but didn&#039;t understand why he used it in a negative context. Every fighting game has its own &quot;feel&quot; to the combat, and to me, Tekken definitely feels like &quot;punching through bricks walls&quot;, which means &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; managed to successfully capture the feeling of the games. In my book, that&#039;s another plus.<br />
<br />
Special moves incorporated? Check.<br />
<br />
This is a must for any fighting game adaptation looking to obtain accreditation as fan wank material, and again, &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; doesn&#039;t disappoint. In fact, the movie integrated the special moves better than any other adaptations I can think of. If you haven&#039;t really played Tekken, you can probably watch the whole thing without realising they incorporated a lot of special moves from the game because of the fluidity of the combat. Look carefully though, and those familiar with the games will recognise many of the attacks used during the fights can be performed by the same characters in game.<br />
<br />
Epic battle between the William sisters? Check.<br />
<br />
Powered by one of the most long running rivalries of the franchise, this battle was messed up in the other Tekken anime,  but &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; set the world to rights, treating us to a wonderfully choreographed fight between the Williams sisters.<br />
<br />
Adding all the above point together, and what do we get?<br />
<br />
Bona fide fan wank material? Check.<br />
<br />
By this point you might wonder why I rate &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; so low. The reason is that beyond being a fan wank flick of laudable quality, the movie doesn&#039;t have anything else to offer. Head Honcho Harada stated he wants to make a movie everyone - not just Tekken fans - can enjoy, but he failed on that mission.<br />
<br />
The failure is a strange one, especially in the writing department given the involvement of Dai Satou, whose project CV extrudes gems such as &quot;Eureka Seven&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. Despite Dai Satou allegedly having quite a bit of creative freedom, the story ended up bland and unmemorable. It&#039;s one of those movies where you wish there was less plot, less talk and that people would just get on with punching each other. One of the first and main mis-step comes from having the movie revolve around Shin, which automatically alienated a portion of the fandom as he doesn&#039;t even exist in any of the games. In addition, Shin is the &quot;silent and moody&quot; type, also known as the blank-slate personality type. As though to compensate for Shin&#039;s lack of words, the anime surrounds him with Xiaoyu and Alisa, whose annoying voices gets fed far too many lines. I don&#039;t think I realised just how annoying those two characters are until I watched this movie. <br />
<br />
Xiaoyu and Alisa getting so much screen time really drags the movie down, and the only bright side is that they kick the shit out of each other at one point. As satisfying and as awesome the fight was though, it doesn&#039;t quite make up for the pair&#039;s prominence in the movie. To be fair, the characters don&#039;t come off as inaccurately portrayed, I just think the makers could have picked better characters to front the movie, especially given Tekken&#039;s huge roster.<br />
<br />
The only other complaint I have is the final fight. The anime tried too hard to make a fitting climactic fight. While it kicked off great, it ended up too long and too ridiculous (even by Tekken standards). I see it as probably the weakest fight in the movie, and also the longest.<br />
<br />
So there you have it. &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot; - bad movie; good fan wank material.<br />
<br />
Personal rating: -1.0 (bad)<br />

    For me the Story, was fairly good but only if you&#039;ve played a Tekken game or know about the Tekken universe. The Art and Sound, were honestly on life level, every scene was on par and each conversation, action scene and each combo was pretty swae. The warm up fight between Xiaoyu and Alisa really preped me for the fight between Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi Mishima. Now that was hectic, the fighting scene though really pumped me, every punch was like a f*#k you, power behind those punches. Great movie, and the Orchestra bg was magical. <br />
The bond between Xiaoyu and Alisa showed me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238343">
        the nature of friendliness and under apprehension of how close connections are important. They show this through their use of camera lens techniques such as a mid shot close up. First during the scene where they discuss their &#039;reason&#039; for sneaking around Shin Kamiya house, we learn that for martial warriors they are very emotional and quickly gain a connection. Finally during the visit to lees house and during the final battle there is a contrasting connection from the two scenes during Lees house scene we see a mid-close shot view of the girls hugging, while Xiaoyu is laying on her thigh we see them gain a bit of connection for each other as she tells a story, explains Alisa is similar to a warm refrigerator, this metaphor helps us reflect on how even though a refrigerator is cold, Alisas is quite bubbly and bright having a &#039;warm&#039; personality this connection of having love for a &#039;refrigerator&#039;  is further emphasized as we watch the final scene where the positions have flipped, and Xiaoyu is holding Alisa on her lap, the mid-shot helps us see the raw emotion. Xiaoyu is crying, rocking using the full swing of her body, showing us the power of her emotion. We see that through a close-up of her tearful emotion and as her droplets fall hitting her circuit causing her system to restart we see her emotions really powering through.

    Hello bullitbaby here to help you understand the only reason ANYONE watched this anime.  We loved the fighting games of yore.<br />
<br />
The end.  <br />
<br />
On a rather sadistic note, i must say i began doing things during the movie like keeping track on paoer the number of times the dialog didnt match the mouth movements.  Someone said, hey just make the mouth move, noone watches peoples mouths.<br />
<br />
Noone but ME muuuhhahahah.  Anyway, i lost count around 791 times.  <br />
<br />
This anime also has another weird thing to count on paper.  <br />
The number of times that the animation chracters eyes move in a strange

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321121">
        unnatural way.<br />
<br />
Whats unnatural.  Im not sure how to descibe it.  Just waste your life watching this for 20 min if you can stand it and somewhere in there youll catch the eyes for instance looking at nothing while still talking or just kinda sliding to the left or right at end of a sentence.  Its just weird ya gotta see it and then you CANT stop seeing it like everywhere.<br />
<br />
I dubbed it the demon eye effect and decided all the characters were demon possessed and then pulled up the wiki for demon names and behaviors and then renamed all the characters demon names based on ancient demon lore.<br />
God thise eyes are so messed up.<br />
<br />
I mean what else ya gona do while something this awful is playing.<br />
<br />
For any MORE detailed review of the 1001 reasons to hate this anime, please read all the other reviews.  <br />
<br />
ITS a review bloodbath and WELL DESERVED.<br />
<br />
If however you are INSPIRED by me to count the mouth words out of sync, the weird eye movements, fighting moves that are unidentifyable and possibly physically impossible, and decide which REAL demons are controlling their eyes at random times........<br />
<br />
......then I believe you will enjoy this movie and be sure an include plenty of alcohol which does make the demon naming a lot more fun especially when done with friends natirally.  You can even name the weird fighting moves that make no sense and then try and count them as well.  The glove has been thrown...go forth my children, let the demon naming BEGIN.

    My boyfriend downloaded this movie for me because of my own curiosity (Admittedly, I&#039;m a Tekken fan myself). And now, this is the result of my answered curiosity..<br />
<br />
Story? 3. The plot wasn&#039;t very well developed and at some points, you won&#039;t understand where it is going.<br />
<br />
Art? 10. Graphics were really good. It was very clear. Animation is awesome.<br />
<br />
Sound? 7. I think it was okay.<br />
<br />
Characters? 6. Of course, the characters look the same as those in video games. I rated it &quot;Good&quot; because only few characters appeared in the movie. So don&#039;t expect that you&#039;ll see them all. **sorry, Spoiler.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment? 7. For a Tekken fan, at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61175">
        some point, you&#039;ll understand what they&#039;re talking about but there will be disappointments, and for a non-Tekken fan, I think there will be a lot that you won&#039;t understand but I know you&#039;ll somewhat enjoy this because of some factors. Nevertheless, the action scenes were very good. Lee Chaolan&#039;s little appearances and Panda&#039;s scenes gave quite an impact for enjoyment as well. Those are the factors I considered for an 7. **sorry, Spoiler.<br />
<br />
Overall? Just 5. I read some reviews before watching this movie so I was really expecting a poor story line. I recommend that you don&#039;t expect a lot from the story, but at least enjoy the action/fight scenes here.<br />
<br />
All I can say is that, I want to see a better film for Tekken, since the Animation was really epic. Back it up with a powerful story, the rating would be very good. They should put a lot of justice on the story and roles next time.

    Don&#039;t watch it for the story, watch it for the Tekken aesthetic.<br />
<br />
If you are not a Tekken fan, this film will not be worth a watch or even a glance. For a true Tekken fan this is perfection.<br />
<br />
This is by no means a masterpiece. I came in expecting to see the wacky world of Tekken come to life. I was treated with an amazing cast of spot-on characters, exciting fights and a non-sensical plotline. This to me is the heart of Tekken.<br />
<br />
It felt like I was watching a long Tekken cinematic. As a big fan of the cinematics found in the game, this delivered on

    The Tekken franchise is amongst the most famous and entertaining martial fighting videogames but when it comes to stories, they plain suck. Most characters have a backdrop story alright but it is usually simple or doesn’t really head anywhere. Along the years it has also received three movie adaptations (so far) in an attempt to please the fans. One was a low budget production from 1998, which is considered to be one of the worst adaptations of all time because studio DEEN made it. In 2010 there was also a live action adaptation by dear old Hollywood and it is also considered bad for its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320731">
        very loose relation to the actual storyline, as well as the complete lack of characterization. Meaning, the characters all looked like pitiful frail gays instead of super GAR awesome ultra powerful martial artists who break a wall with a finger. And in 2011 we got the third attempt, this time a high budget full CGI movie. It is in overall far more entertaining than the previous two because they poured good money in it. It was made in 3D and by Japanese people, who are not part of that fakin piece of uber shitty crapfest studio DEEN or some mediocre predictable boring gaylord Hollywood studio. So it looks nice.<br />
<br />
Looking nice though is the only good it has because other than that it is one hell of a boring film. The last 25 minutes are cool for being non-stop super awesome action but the other 100 minutes before it are feeling like a torture. And it has nothing to do with the visuals or the soundtrack which are pretty well made and cool to stare or listen to. I am talking about the plot and the characters… and how retarded they all feel.<br />
<br />
The first scene is about Anna and Nina fighting for the nth time. Their actual duel is fine but you are just facepalming at how Anna could walk away from a truck that blew up spectacularly while she was in the driver’s seat at that moment, or how Nina could escape twenty soldiers who were aiming at her with laser with a simple air flip. It may seem cool but it is otherwise completely retarded. And as it turns out pointless as well because that scene offered absolutely nothing to the actual plot. They could have taken it out entirely and nobody would tell the difference.<br />
<br />
The second scene is about goofy school girl Ling Xiaoyu being late for school while riding her panda sidekick. As punishment she is threatened to be expelled from school, unless she agrees to become a spy for a sinister organization. Yeah, that makes sense…<br />
<br />
Her mission is to go to another school and find out what is going on with a young man called Kamiya Shin. While she is stalking him and even peeping him while he is naked in the bathroom, she meets another goofy girl dressed like a cosplayer called Alisa. They become friends as she too is curious to find out what is going on with him. So for about half an hour which felt like an eternity of boredom, they are having fun in school and do all sorts of silly stuff that have absolutely nothing to do with spying. And then they realize they are both spies working for opposite sides and have a fight too. Which was also completely useless to the plot because afterwards they make up and go to this lab and find all sorts of info regarding Kamiya. So at this point you are wondering why did they waste weeks in pointless goofing instead of just heading there at once. Or why were they even chosen as spies if they are so stupid they can’t even do something so simple.<br />
<br />
So after they find out the secret behind Kamiya, they go to meet him in a castle and for some unexplained reason everybody else knows where they are going and follows them there. And thus we have Heihachi, Kazuya, and Jin in the same room ready to fight each other for the nth time as well. So at this point you are wondering what was the point of all this spying when they could just find Kamiya right away and ask him what he knows. I mean it was an hour long build-up (months in-series) for something that could have happened right away.<br />
<br />
So to hell with the school girl and the cosplayer and all the fuzzy friendship stuff they exchanged so far. They were POINTLESS! Now we get to see the main fighters doing what they know best: Breaking stuff. And yes, the last 25 minutes are non-stop super cool action and I loved them for that. The story still made no sense though because all this time there was this huge spiritual power in a trunk that nobody knew about or was too busy to secure before they senselessly started punching each other. And wait a second; isn’t this the EXACT same thing that happened in the finale of the fourth game? These guys never learn from their mistakes, do they now?<br />
<br />
And after the battle, the movie is over. That’s it. It was basically two spars between some airhead chicks and then some uber brawl amongst equally dumb supermen. The story was barely there, the line of though made no sense, and the dialogues felt like they were all still in junior high. YAWN! Just skip to the last third of the movie and don’t pay attention to whatever they are saying. This way you will enjoy it to its fullest. Other than that, the movie is MEH!<br />
<br />
And now for some excused scorings.<br />
