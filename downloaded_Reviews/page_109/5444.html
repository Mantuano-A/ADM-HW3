    Is it already the year 2017 and you still haven&#039;t converted to the church of lolicon yet? That is very unfortunate, but maybe this anime will manage to enlighten you. At least it did a good job of reminding me of why I became one in the first place.<br />
<br />
Tenshi no 3P is more or less the spiritual sequel to Ro-Kyu-Bu, coming from the same author and adapted by the same animation studio. So if you&#039;ve seen that show, you can consider that a rough baseline on what to expect here too, merely that instead of loli basketball we here have a loli rock band. However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258633">
        it must also be stated that Tenshi no 3P is generally a bit more serious and wholesome than RKB was, but on the flipside it has less ecchi elements instead. As for whether that&#039;s a good or a bad thing... well that&#039;s up to you to decide.<br />
<br />
The story mainly follows three orphaned elementary school girls, ostracized from their school classmates and living inside a church. In an attempt at spreading some joy both for themselves and for the local kids, they decide to form a band and then host a concert for them. In order to do so, they seek the help of the anime&#039;s high schooler protagonist Nukui Kyou—an independent music producer they found on the internet who lives nearby—and asks him to become their manager and help them fulfill their modest dreams.<br />
<br />
Now it should be said that while the show is clearly made for lolicons primarily, it&#039;s not like it&#039;s totally unwatchable even if you aren&#039;t one because content-wise Tenshi no 3P actually has mostly more wholesome key plot elements in it. For one, the music is a rather central theme over the course of the story, and while it doesn&#039;t exactly go into detail about how the girls&#039; are improving on a technical level, there is at least a respectable amount of effort put into the musical department of the anime, with numerous live performances and songs done by the main seiyuu cast. I guess you could argue that the girls are perhaps a bit *too* good at it considering their ages, but well that&#039;s anime for you. Mind you though, this is *not* an idol anime by any means; the girls are not trying to become professional musicians at all. This is only a small scale spare time project of theirs. We also have a decent amount of drama and characterization in the form of these girls&#039; rather miserable life situations as orphans and outcasts in their school, and there are some genuinely touching moments every here and there. I especially find the rather noble intentions behind the girls&#039; musical ambitions to be rather heartwarming. There are also some secondary characters introduced over the course of the anime who add some additional perspective on the strange relationship between Kyou and the kids and end up influencing the story in various ways as time goes on.<br />
<br />
That said, even though there are numerous more serious merits to the show, in order to get the full intended experience of Tenshi no 3P then I think you pretty much have to be a lolicon in the end. Take my word for it: if you&#039;re not feeling some sort of subconscious desire to split Jun in two and attempt to make babies with her half the time she&#039;s on screen then you&#039;re missing out on about half the potential enjoyment value of this anime. Not to mention the dominant and sexually aggressive HanaKana loli Kiriyume that is introduced in the latter part of the show; I&#039;d lick her toes any day of the week. It&#039;s definitely not as lewd as Ro-Kyu-Bu was and in general it does have a more serious atmosphere, but in the end the show&#039;s main selling point naturally lies with its lolis, especially the main trio consisting of Jun, Sora and Nozomi. They are rather different from each other with Jun being the ultra-moe poster girl, Sora being the comic relief character and Nozomi being the more vocal and emotional of the trio, so they balance each other out quite nicely as a group. Amongst the side lolis we also have the MC&#039;s jealous little sister Kurumi (who unfortunately doesn&#039;t get as much screen time as she probably deserved) as well as the rather forceful aforementioned Kiriyume who they end up meeting in the second half of the anime. To add a bit of variety there are also a pair of non-lolis involved in the form of the MC&#039;s childhood friend Sakura and Kiriyume&#039;s caretaker Yuzuha, the latter of which is supposedly an elementary schooler too but she looks way older than that so I&#039;m not sure what that&#039;s about. So that makes seven girls in total, but as for whether that makes it a harem or not is a bit debatable since it&#039;s pretty unclear what kind of feelings the little girls really have for Kyou considering that they&#039;re still prepubescent (they probably don&#039;t understand what love is yet). Either way, their general depiction is leaning more towards moe than ecchi though—which is another difference from Ro-Kyu-Bu I think—as while there certainly are some occasional shots with a lot of underage skin showing (like bathroom scenes), for the most part the girls are presented as more cute and adorable than alluring. Most of the &quot;lewd&quot; scenes of Tenshi no 3P basically just consist of sexual innuendos in the form of some intentionally ero-sounding dialogue which in reality describes something totally innocent (you probably know what I&#039;m talking about, it&#039;s a pretty common narrative trick in romcoms and stuff), usually as the opening scene of an episode.<br />
<br />
This pattern does admittedly change a bit towards the end of the show (episodes 10 and 11 to be exact) as then the more serious arc that was ongoing has just ended and apparently they decided to round that out the anime with being a bit more light-hearted and harem-like than the rest of the show, and it does have more ecchi elements in it. However, considering that this show was ultimately made for lolicons primarily, I can&#039;t say this was a very unexpected development, nor did I mind it at all. It&#039;s difficult to say whether or not that means that the anime would&#039;ve been better as a whole if the rest of the show had been more ecchi-oriented as well or not, but I&#039;m fairly happy with what we got so I won&#039;t think too much about it. That being said I still certainly hope we&#039;ll see some doujins of these girls in the future. The last episode does provide a quite satisfying finale though.<br />
<br />
All-in-all I would probably still say that Ro-Kyu-Bu was a bit better than Tenshi no 3P but this is still something I would wholeheartedly recommend to other lolicons or people who just like moe girls in slice of life shows in general (as the show doesn&#039;t really have much ecchi other than the last few episodes). Unfortunately anything remotely loli-themed is bound to get slammed by prejudiced and narrow-minded westerners for no other reason than that &quot;it&#039;s creepy&quot; so I&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be a bunch of clueless statements thrown around in some places, but hopefully people will be sensible enough to not pay them too much heed. But at least the show is obscure enough to be able to dodge most of the obligatory hate bandwagon, so maybe not all hope is lost.

    I have never seen a show this underrated before. Not only because of the gay score of 6.72 but also its unpopularity with just almost 19k users who completed the show. This show is basically the meaning of a &quot;hidden gem&quot;, I would never have found this masterpiece even by sorting top anime by score rating or popularity if it wasn&#039;t for that loli moments video I found on youtube.<br />
<br />
This show overwhelmed me several times. I expected a big mature man at the meeting place but it turns out to be 3 kawaii lolis instead, I expected Kiriyume to be a normal woman but she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331430">
        turns out to be a loli instead, I expected this show to have 1 loli but I got a loli harem with 5 lolis in it instead.<br />
<br />
(OMG that&#039;s so rare, normally a loli show is already rare enough [which contains like only 1 loli character] But this show has 5 lolis! 5x enjoyment; buy 1 get 4 free). Moreover, this show has a reasonable amount of loli fanservice scenes and each of them is very HD quality.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10:<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t see a reason to hate this show, even if the watcher is not a lolicon. The plot is very unique and I enjoyed the story itself excluding the lolis. <br />
<br />
Art 10/10:<br />
<br />
All lolis character designs are very kawaii and HD as expected from a studio experienced in making quality loli shows.<br />
<br />
Sound 11/10:<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the sound is the main focal point of the show. I never skipped the OP and the EDs, the OSTs are also very good, I remember imagining this moment when I write about how good the sounds are when I certain OST came in the background during the show. But most of all, I like the band&#039;s song especially the SAY HOWLING! song, the climax is very catchy, in fact, I&#039;m still hearing it right now while writing this review.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10:<br />
<br />
Every loli has their own personality especially the main 3 lolis, the shy and clumsy one, the brave but sleepy one, and the tsundere and mature one. They are all very unique which altogether makes the show very interesting when the MC takes different loli routes experiencing a different mood from the other ones which are pretty amazing for the writer to be able to create up to 5 unique loli characters as they may be hard to make, right? (Shakugan no Shana, Hidan no Aria and Toradora all have the same loli personality) Which may also explain why there are not many loli harem shows.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10:<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the show and I&#039;m very sad that the journey has ended so quickly without any sequels or even OVAs to follow up. That last recap scene at the end was very nostalgic and tragic, they don&#039;t have the Sora god special moment at the end of the show too. Very sad to see the show left me so suddenly.<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10:<br />
<br />
This show and Ryuuou no Oshigoto! makes me want to watch other loli shows by this studio as well and of course, I&#039;m also looking forward to the ((hent of this show.<br />
<br />

    Started watching because I&#039;m a huge lolicon. Ended up loving nearly everything else and at times even forgetting to stare at the pantsu. Be adviced that watching this and getting upset for showing off underaged girls and being more about a relaxed mood than some deep story is like watching a basketball anime and getting upset because you hate sports.<br />
<br />
Expect to see a finely distributed little collection of fine little bodies, however that&#039;s not where this anime shines because those short scenes are just small bits of service woven into the story in a fun way. Music is a highly personal thing and taste may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259227">
        differ greatly, that aside however the pieces generously included are of very high average quality with rich sound and gently peppy rock tunes. As for the story it&#039;s not important and something you&#039;re better off not reading or caring much about, this is a show that is meant to be enjoyed as a relaxing oasis of sweet tunes and sweet girls that just once in a while pinches you in the ticker to make sure you don&#039;t get lulled to sleep.

     3P is a fun anime with a bit of a heartfelt storyline that has been done befor but with a little different twist. The story basically revolves around a shut in who&#039;s hobby of making music gets noticed by some orphan girls who need his talent to help them in their own endeavors. What makes the story more enjoyable than the normal &quot;kid busting out of his shell&quot; storyline are the characters involved, especially the three young orphan girls who each have their own little quirky personalities. The jokes at times can be a little over the top, focusing on the whole pedo shtick

    Now imma guess some of you are wondering why i stopped the show at ep 4 and am giving it an 8. This is actually my first and maybe only review on Mal so dont hate me if this doesnt sound professional like other people. <br />
<br />
This is going to have some spoilers to explain the main plot of ep 1-4 and also the reasons as to why i dropped it.<br />
<br />
I started this show thinking I&#039;d drop it in a heartbeat on ep 1. However with the first sum of minutes I was highly entertained and interested with the mc, It was later revealed that he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255548">
        had anxiety so after a certain incident happened in his middle school he became a hikikomori and stayed home all day. According to him the only person he truly talks to is his little sister. At home he makes music alone but he receives a message from a fan asking if they would want to meat. The message sounded as if it was from an older gentleman but later told it was a little grade schooler asking him for help in a band with her friends. They drag him to their home and he does agree to become their manager so they try to get people in the orphanage they are at to hold a farewell party cause the place is going to be sold. That&#039;s all well and nice but the real main problem with this show is the intended audience. I&#039;m not going to yell at all the lolicons that love this, cause I like lolis myself (not to a high degree). To put it simply these are the main points of the show:<br />
<br />
Good Points:<br />
- The setting is interesting having a high schooler that deals with anxiety.<br />
- Not only the mc but the main girls also have their own problems with their own lives and arent making friends for some reason.<br />
- When the show plays from the original setting it is gripping and gets you fully entertained.<br />
- The music played in the show isnt that bad and a music geek might have fun watching.<br />
<br />
Bad Points:<br />
- They keep lewding the characters when it&#039;s not needed to do so seeing as how they have quite the interesting setting.<br />
- Each episode ends or begins with lewding the main girls.<br />
- After a few eps the main girls actually become rather annoying.<br />
- At this point in the story all the interesting points of the story are over now.<br />
- The show will most likely move on just lewding all the girls now that they dont have a story to work with.<br />
<br />
There were probably more reasons but due to it being so long I&#039;ve seen an ep I cant even remember the OP or ED at all<br />
I&#039;m not going to continue the show based on the fact that the show can only get worse from here on out. Both the things I personally were interested in for this anime ended so I really have no reason to continue it any longer.<br />
<br />
Anyone can go in and enjoy the show as they please, I wont see anything bad by it. I just see this show as one of the disappointments of anime that come out every now and then. *cough cough* Kotoura-san *cough cough*

    Another season, another cute girls doing cute things show.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Tenshi no 3P! another boring show with moments of excitements that you can find in almost any cute girl anime. Our protagonist Kyou is an average schooler with a passion for music. He loves to make music and is, unsurprisingly, a NEET. With a cute little sister at home, his only aim in life is shown to be making music.<br />
<br />
But a NEET can&#039;t stay one forever in an anime, so a bunch of cute girls come along and ask him to help them for a band. He agrees and what follows is your usual anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258634">
        plot.<br />
<br />
STORY: Extremely predictable, Tenshi no 3P! has one of the weakest storylines of this season. Kyou meets girls, they try to seduce him, exciting moments and the end.<br />
<br />
ART: This is one part where Tenshi did okay. The characters look good, the scenery appears beautiful and the girls look cute. No complaints.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Being a music focused anime, I thought that I&#039;d get some good OPs and EDs to download. While they may sound good to some, I hated them nonetheless. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: Don&#039;t expect any huge character developments from the show. Kyou remains shy as ever, the girls get cuter and my ship doesn&#039;t sail(Booooo).<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: If you are in for cute girl stuff, you have hit the mark. There are plenty of tingling and exciting moments. Abundance of pantsu shots and whatnot, so if you love them you are in for a ride. Just don&#039;t expect to get overwhelmed watching Tenshi no 3P! It really sucks.<br />
<br />
Conclusion? If you have nothing to do in life(like me) you can probably watch it. Otherwise, rewatch your old favorites. I should have done the same too.<br />
<br />

    Possible spoilers???<br />
<br />
I really wanted to like this series. It has a cute design, the animation is decent--not the best, but I liked it enough--and I really liked the music. There&#039;s only one thing that made me hate this enough to drop it. <br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
A teenage hikkikomori with musical talent has accepted the task of helping three orphan girls hold a concert at the church by the end of May. A decent plot. There isn&#039;t too much going on, it&#039;s simple enough to understand what the main goal is for the series.<br />
I don&#039;t really hate anything about this portion of the show. Again, it isn&#039;t the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254819">
        best, but it&#039;s not the worst. It&#039;s decent.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
I liked the design of everything! I thought the girls were very cute, though I just thought it was weird how they were the only ones dressed in such fancy/lolita clothes. Then again, they are little girls. <br />
Animation was better than other shows I&#039;ve seen this season. I would&#039;ve given it a higher scoring if it was just a little more refined. <br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
It was great. I like the kind of music they were playing in this show, though I do love most genres of music. <br />
They made each song fit well to the scene, and I really have little to no problems, here.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
<br />
This was my main problem. <br />
The characters are textbook, and are nothing but that one trait.<br />
<br />
You have the hikkikomori teenage boy. He doesn&#039;t leave his home often, stays in his room, refuses to go to school because of his social anxiety, and plays music as his outlet. That&#039;s the only difference he has to other characters like him.<br />
Then there&#039;s his little sister, a tsundere that gets salty when her Onii-Chan(TM) talks to another girl and not her. Just... why? It&#039;s so overused and boring.<br />
You have the three orphan girls. <br />
<br />
Jun, a shy, girly, extremely high-pitched girl that will cry at the drop of a hat. Her voice is akin to nails on a chalkboard. I just couldn&#039;t like her outside of her character design.<br />
Sora, a quiet, emotionless girl that&#039;s always sleepy. She is a mirror of Shiro from No Game No Life, personality wise. Er, her lack thereof. <br />
And finally, Nozomi. A tsundere. That&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
They are just bland, to me, annoying, honestly.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
The fanservice was just obnoxious. I love panty shots and perverted/comedic context as much as the next guy, but I just have a problem with it when it comes to elementary school girls. That, and it was just so often, I couldn&#039;t go five minutes without some kind of fanservice!<br />
<br />
I was really liking this show while watching episode one. I was tolerating Jun&#039;s voice, which was, at the time, the worst thing about the show so far. Then at the end, they ruined it. <br />
I just can&#039;t get used to the fanservice, and Jun&#039;s voice just gets more and more annoying. <br />
<br />
I might give it another chance when all 12 episodes are out, but I doubt it.

    Let me get this out of the way: If you didn&#039;t think K-On! was for you since it was a slice-of-life show more than a show about a band of cute girls, this show is a show about a band of cute girls, with an actual band-related plot structure.<br />
<br />
It was absolutely great and adorable. I would say it doesn&#039;t have as much loli fanservice as you might expect. It&#039;s ratio of loli fanservice to loli moe is somewhere between GochiUsa and Dragon Maid.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll check out the no-fanservice edit and report back.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The show is adorable, although a bit formulaic. The first half of the first episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261709">
        is focused on what led our MC to become a music-obsessed high-school NEET, including subtle encounters with two clearly soon-to-be main characters.<br />
<br />
From then on we hit straight into the story arc introducing the loli band, their immediate motivations, and two side characters including the suspicious characters from the first episode.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s a story arc bringing the MC and the other 5 characters together, with a drama arc instead of a concert arc this time. A romance subplot is introduced for the most appropriate character.<br />
<br />
The drama overflows into the next 3 episode story arc about introducing 2 new lolis and their tragic backstory, but this time it&#039;s a concert arc. The romance subplot becomes a joke harem.<br />
<br />
Finally we get a 3 episode battle of the bands arc between the 3 loli band, and the remaining 3 lolis. The newest loli band loses, but there&#039;s no sense of closure as they say that it&#039;s only the beginning, and the romance subplot fails to even come up.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s formulaic and arc driven story combined with a huge &quot;read the source material or pray for Season 2 as you buy Japanese Blu-Rays&quot; ending, knocked off a few points for me. But it was a serviceable story with it&#039;s heartstring moments. And it was more than enough to bring out the loli moe characters we&#039;re all clearly here to see.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Sound was great, loved all the rock tracks. A bit lazy with the editing at times, but the soundtrack was phenomenal for a loli-rock band show. The amateur aspects sounded amateur enough to be convincing. I really enjoyed one character&#039;s increasingly terrible piano practice.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art in this show is good, but I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s fantastic. You can tell it was drawn rather cheaply, but they have great character design so the moe comes through when it needs to. I&#039;d love to see what the blu-ray brings to the table, but I don&#039;t want to be put on any more lists.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters are all adorable and all get sufficiently enough backstory and explanation to make them believable. Which is a pretty high bar in CGDCT territory. Obviously, not as much time per character for development is available compared to other CGDCT anime, due to this show having a plot, but you&#039;re not left wondering what a certain character would do in any given scene.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I got a lot of great enjoyment out of the series, it was bright, cute, happy, and fun. The entire ride was comfy, but with enough bumps that it wasn&#039;t boring. I feel like they nailed the sweet spot for a balance in:<br />
<br />
fanservice / moe<br />
CGDCT/harem<br />
plot/slice-of-life<br />
drama/comedy<br />
<br />
as well as tone and having great versions of a whopping 6 different types of loli waifus. The &quot;main&quot; girl is also pretty great.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say this show delivered a lot more than I expected it would. I&#039;d say it&#039;s a CGDCT show with just enough plot and romantic spice to keep you from sinking into complacency. Also, it&#039;s about a band, they play music pretty often. You get to see an animated 3 piece loli band play music pretty often.<br />
<br />
If that&#039;s not worth a 9, I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The source material is a light novel released in 2012, along with a manga adaptation that started in 2014. Neither is translated by an official source, or a fan scanlator. If you don&#039;t want to be blueballed by an inability to finish the story, learn Japanese or don&#039;t watch the show. If you just want 5 hours of cute moe lolis in a band, regardless of story, go on ahead.

    So i recently finished &quot;Tenshi no 3p&quot;, i personally believe its underrated anime, the story was really good and the way it was plotted was also cute. I think its worth watching even if you dont like music anime, there were a lot cute scenes and the angels trio were cute as heavenly. <br />
I would never have thought a show rated 6.72 (when i wrote this review) will be this good, there were some time when i thought its a bit slow but nah it was gucci overall. <br />
The ending was really sweet i wish there was a season 2, I&#039;d like of this was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345215">
        more romantic (Kyou x Sakura) but i think this will do. I was planning this anime from a long time, damn i should have seen this a lot earlier. <br />
Voice actress &quot;Oono Yuuko&quot; who had done voice acting of &quot;jun gotou&quot; voice actress &quot;Koga Aoi&quot; who had done voice acting of &quot;Sora Kaneshiro&quot; and voice actress &quot;Itou, Kanae&quot; who had done &quot;Sakura Toriumi&quot; these voice actress made the show masterpiece other voice actress were good too &quot;Endou, Yurika&quot; was also the best in this show. Specifically these all actress made the show wonderful and i became fan of Oono Yuuko her was was perfect for the character &quot;Jun&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to watch this anime its really sweet. Loved it, wonderfully done

    Watch this if you wanna get arrested,<br />
<br />
Story was okay, not out of this world or brilliant but just some heartwarming stuff in it.<br />
<br />
Art, it was good, good enough to outline the lolis, I mean for an anime like this you shouldnt be expecting anything crazy.<br />
<br />
Sound, could be better but sadly I didnt find much of them too good but it was well positioned in the anime.<br />
<br />
Character, well Im probably gonna be arrested, but for those cute loli moments, I&#039;d say it was worth behind the bars.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, I laughed quite a lot because of the lines that those lolis had to say, their innocence was loliriffic,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298021">
        I enjoyed this show a lot, this show is not for everyone but its a good one for resting because of the moments that are embedded in this show, especially if you&#039;ve just finished watching animes that were intense or tear jerking or (you know what i mean), basically it&#039;s a good time waster.<br />
<br />
Overall, since we cant put in decimals Ill just put it here, 8.5 is kind of fitting in the time wasting category for me, after just watching intense stuff you ought for some heartwarming and ridiculous stuff like these to get your shit up again, and for me, it definitely worked well.<br />
<br />
nuff said.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
Art 8/10<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
Character 9/10 (lolis whatchu expect?)<br />
Enjoyment 8/10<br />
Overall 8.5/10<br />
<br />
now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I gotta recharge myself with some loli energy.<br />

    I originally dropped this series, it felt kind of exploitative to have a character in high school help three, orphaned elementary schoolers — who all openly flirt with him. Truthfully, it gave me the heebie-jeebies, especially when there started to be more and more uncomfortable ecchi scenes. But, I gave it chance again, shortly after I became a fan of &quot;Rō-Kyū-Bu!&quot; — which is by the same writer, Sagu Aoyama, and their stories are always a ray of light through a cracked window sill of ethical obscurity.<br />
<br />
⚠️ This review of Tenshi no 3P! will be spoiler-free ⚠️<br />
<br />
—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
As I mentioned earlier, the framing of the premise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378473">
        in the beginning of the series seems... pedophilic, but when Kyō&#039;s doting friend from school (&quot;Sakura Toriumi&quot;) starts to help him look after the girls... it seems less like a potentially manipulative situation and more like a couple taking care of children. It reminded me of the situation in &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; — where Kōta and Yuka take care of the mentally incapacitated &quot;Nyu&quot;, and they begin to fall in love while looking after her! The situation is even more averted from the initial weirdness, because Kyō Nukui is like many other harem protagonists and will get flustered by a moment of sudden intimacy, but is too shy and kind-hearted to act on anything!<br />
<br />
Kyō Nukui is a high school drop-out, turned shut-in, who is more or less an unstated VOCALOID composer — going under the handle of &quot;HibikiP&quot;! Jūn Goto, an orphaned young girl, sends him a private message and asks him to help write compositions for her band, so that their orphanage doesn&#039;t get shut down. Yes, it&#039;s like every season of &quot;Love Live!&quot;... but, with children instead of teenagers! It is then revealed that his childhood friend, that is in the same grade as him, is also an orphan and grew up in the same chapel as the young girls! Naturally she joins in their effort to preserve the building, partially because of her feelings of nostalgia and her budding relationship with the trio, and also, because it&#039;s clear that she has a crush on Kyō! I call it &quot;childhood friend syndrome&quot;! If you didn&#039;t know already, it&#039;s a chronic condition in anime!<br />
<br />
There are various conflicts along the way, Nozomi (the bassist), almost gets adopted by her biological grandfather in England and is torn on whether to move or stay with her friends; Kyō&#039;s closest online friend also invites the girls to perform on a resort island, but there is more behind the request then they originally think! Despite all of the twists and turns, the girls all stick together and Kyō&#039;s harem grows, after the introduction of two new characters (Kyō&#039;s younger sister can also be considered a part of the harem, but I try not to think about that too deeply...) and thus, the romantic comedy hijinks ensue!<br />

Luna&#039;s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅<br />
<br />
Shinsuke Yanagi (director), notable works:<br />
* Chōjin Kōkōsei-tachi wa Isekai demo Yoyū de Ikinuku you desu! (&quot;CHOYOYU!: High School Prodigies Have It Easy Even in Another World!&quot;)<br />
* Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun (&quot;Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki&quot;)<br />
* Momo Kyun Sword<br />
* Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? (&quot;And you thought there is never a girl online?&quot;) ✅<br />
* Rō-Kyū-Bu! SS ✅<br />
* Ryūō no Oshigoto! (&quot;The Ryūō&#039;s Work is Never Done!&quot;)<br />
* Zettai Junpaku♡Mahō Shōjo ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: I haven&#039;t seen all of Mr. Yanagi&#039;s filmography, but from what I&#039;ve watched, it&#039;s mostly so-so in terms of quality. As I mentioned before, I am a fan of the &quot;Rō-Kyū-Bu!&quot; franchise, but Keizō Kusakawa&#039;s adaptation of the first season was far better than the second season, directed by the aforementioned Shinsuke Yanagi. I would say that &quot;Tenshi no 3P!&quot; has been his best creation, since his directorial debut (that I HAVE SEEN). A very fair-to-middling director, but he gets the job done!<br />
<br />
Good Seiyū Work = ✅<br />
<br />
Really Enjoyed the Seiyū&#039;s Performance = ✅✅<br />
<br />
One of Luna&#039;s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅✅✅<br />
<br />
Yūki Inōe as Kyō Nukui, notable roles:<br />
* A106, Atom: The Beginning ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: I haven&#039;t heard any of Mr. Inōe, I only listened to him as A106 briefly in the one or two episodes that I saw of &quot;Atom: The Beginning&quot;! His voice isn&#039;t the most distinctive, but it functions fine with many of the first-person perspective camera angles that we&#039;re seeing the story through. His demeanor is that of an eroge protagonist, but it works well with the story that the author was trying to tell. Great job!<br />
<br />
Yūko Ōno as Jun Gotō, notable roles:<br />
* Nemesis, Infinite Dendrogram ✅<br />
* Yuzu, Konohana Kitan ✅✅✅<br />
* Aya Asagiri, Mahō Shōjo Site ✅✅<br />
* Hiyo Yukino, Ongaku Shōjo (TV)<br />
* Jeanna D&#039;Arc, Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc and the Alchemist Knight ✅✅✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: Ms. Ōno is a fairly new talent in the industry, but I freakin&#039; love her voice! I thought she was amazing in &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot;, &quot;Mahō Shōjo Site&quot;, and &quot;Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc and the Alchemist Knight&quot;! Aside from Sakura being a top pick for best girl, Ms. Ōno&#039;s performance as Jun Gotō was very charming and, for me, she was easily the most likable out of the main trio! Incredible performance, and I hope that Yūko Ōno keeps getting more roles as cute girls!<br />
<br />
Yurika Endō as Nozomi Momijidani, notable roles:<br />
* Asuna Kangoshi, Anime de Wakaru Shinryōnaika (&quot;Comical Psychosomatic Medicine&quot;)<br />
* Lisa Imai, BanG Dream ✅ — role reprised by Yuki Nakashima<br />
* Haruno Yoshikawa, Diamond no Ace (series)<br />
* Windom, Kaijū Girls: Ultra Kaijū Gijinka Keikaku ✅<br />
* Rina Sakai, Sakura Trick<br />
<br />
Commentary: It&#039;s hard to create a comparison between Ms. Endō&#039;s other roles and this one, because I&#039;m so accustomed to Lisa Imai&#039;s &quot;new&quot; voice, that&#039;s it&#039;s difficult to remember how she sounded before the switch! Regardless, while she is the least memorable girl out of the main three, Ms. Endō still makes Nozomi intensely likable! Great work!<br />
<br />
Aoi Koga as Sora Kaneshiro, notable roles:<br />
* Kaguya Shinomiya, Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunōsen ✅✅✅<br />
* Hanabi, Mahō Shōjo? Naria☆Girls<br />
* Yuri Miyata, Two Car<br />
<br />
Commentary: Most recently, Ms. Koga&#039;s most famous role is Paimon in the mobile game, &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;! With that being said, Ms. Koga has such an adorable voice, I love her as Paimon and Kaguya&#039;s character is the most enjoyable part (FOR ME personally) in the &quot;Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai&quot; series! Sorry, Chika! A blossoming young talent in the industry, I hope that Aoi Koga can land more hit roles! Amazing work!<br />
<br />
Commentary: Ms. Itō is one of my favorite voice actresses of all time, and she does a perfect job at making the tsundere, childhood friend a compassionate and headstrong girl. I would compare her performance as Sakura Toriumi to her roles as Nana Astar Deviluke (&quot;To LOVEる&quot;) and Airi (&quot;Queen&#039;s Blade&quot;)... it&#039;s funny because Sakura is a twin-tailed character and her seiyū voices Airi, who is considered to be one of the most iconic twin-tailed characters of all time! Amazing performance, as always — Ms. Itō has such a strong presence and a beautiful voice!<br />
<br />
Commentary: Another seiyū that I love! Ms. Hidaka has a wonderful voice! Kurumi, Kyō&#039;s little sister, was the dark horse best girl of the show, because she was so enigmatic, snarky, and talented! I would compare her role in &quot;Tenshi no 3P!&quot; to her performances in &quot;Tamako Market&quot; (&quot;Anko Kitashirakawa&quot; is in my list of the top ten best little sisters of all time), &quot;Inu x Boku SS&quot;, and &quot;Show By Rock!!&quot; — Ms. Hidaka the mastery of cute, moe performances perfected! Fantastic job, as always!<br />
<br />
Commentary: Everyone knows who Kana Hanazawa is, but in this production she plays a lonely loli with a tragic life. There is no one better that they could have been chosen for the role, Ms. Hanazawa completely nails it! I would compare her performance as Kōme Ogi to her roles voicing Tomoka Minato (&quot;Rō-Kyū-Bu!&quot;) and Ruri Gokō (&quot;Ore no Imōto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai&quot;). Extraordinary work, as always!<br />
<br />
Commentary: Yuzuha probably has the smallest presence out of the girls, but she was still a very memorable character! Upon seeing her design, I get a fuzzy feeling, a feeling of warm nostalgia! Ms. Iguchi has that effect on me, I can recall feeling that way about her roles as Miku Kohinata (&quot;Senki Zesshō Symphogear&quot;) and Mako Reizei (&quot;Girls und Panzer&quot;), too! Marvelous performance!<br />
<br />
If you have a zero tolerance policy towards younger characters being featured in a number of ecchi scenes, then this is not the anime for you. Despite the series being a soul-stirring experience (even though &quot;Rō-Kyū-Bu!&quot; had a slightly better adaptation), there are still some questionable scenes. Though, luckily, Kyō Nukui has the same affliction as Tenchi Masaki in &quot;Tenchi Muyō!&quot; — where he&#039;ll blush or get flustered, but is too kind-hearted or shy to make an advance on anyone, even girls his own age! I enjoyed the splash of adorable, platonically pure moments and the girls&#039; friendships with each other were nice to experience second-hand. I rate Tenshi no 3P! a 6/10, and suggest it to anyone who isn&#039;t too weirded out by the fanservice!<br />
<br />

    This is a show that is worth watching, but it might make you yawn a few times. It&#039;s not very entertaining, but you will like it if you are a fan of the slice of life genre. It has the potential to give a heartwarming atmosphere and it is very relaxing to just sit back and watch. That is how I watched this anime. <br />
<br />
This is also a show about music, so if you are interested in anime rock music where VAs sing imitating little girls, you might find a few good ones in this one. I think that the OP and the EDs and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259876">
        the insert songs were all quite good, and only one or two songs were memorable for me.<br />
<br />
The characters are mostly all lolis. This show inputs the &quot;dere&quot; categories into each individual loli. For example, the sister is definitely a yandere, and Nozomi, the purple haired girl, is a tsundere. This one will go into my collection of shows that utilize &quot;dere&quot;s. The lolis are all cute and pure and there is mostly no sexualization of them other than showing some skin.<br />
<br />
This show was enjoyable since it was a heartwarming kind of anime and the characters were all very likeable. I give this show an 8.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />

    Tenshi no 3P! has a few cherry picked ecchi scenes that are top quality material.<br />
<br />
The storyline is alright, nothing amazing but still very good.<br />
<br />
This was my first ever lewdish anime that revolves around girls playing musical instruments.<br />
I greatly enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s unique, stands out (to me at least) and makes up for any lacking of character development and story with LEWD ANGLES.<br />
<br />
Not recommended for those easily offended by taboo&#039;d lewdness, but for everyone else with a healthy sense of humor (at the least) you should enjoy this series.<br />
<br />
I personally love any series that isn&#039;t afraid to ignore social stigmas and to push boundaries.<br />
It&#039;s very admirable.

    I watched Tenshi no 3P because I adored Ryuuou no Oshigoto, a more recent loli show from the same studio. It was obvious straight away the two aren&#039;t at all similar in spirit or quality, and furthermore Tenshi no 3P shouldn&#039;t be compared with anything that&#039;s not also a pile of garbage. With the studio&#039;s next upcoming work being for a mobile game, one gets the impression they are all about budget contracts, so it&#039;s not surprising their output includes adaptations of trash.<br />
<br />
Overall, Tenshi no 3P is unsalvageable. Usually I wouldn&#039;t bother writing a negative review on an obscure last year&#039;s show that I should

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279947">
        have just dropped, but the contrast with Ryuuou no Oshigoto, still somewhat recent and superficially similar, is so stark that I thought it was worth noting.<br />
<br />
The show starts as weak, and devolves to being totally phoned in, becoming a letdown despite the start. Around episode 3 or 4 I was starting to warm up to it in a you-ground-me-down kind of way, but then after the band&#039;s first performance it kept going further and further off the deep end.<br />
<br />
There was no real overarching story - the band plays for the first time and then plays a few more times while a few bizarre or at least bizarrely handled sidestories happen. Seemingly major plotlines get casually dropped or brushed away multiple times, which at times felt merciful because of how bad the writing is. There was a &quot;Christian&quot; theme, gifting us with loads of hamfisted inspirational dialogue. At the beginning there was really squalid fanservice, and by the end there was full-on hareming, both of which suffered from the poor writing, and the visual quality, while adequate, didn&#039;t help them pop either.<br />
<br />
The best that can be said of the visuals is that they were competently cheap. Anything more would have been wasted on this show. I didn&#039;t mind the voice acting.<br />
<br />
My interest was perked for a second time when the mc promised to go on a date with each of the girls. I&#039;m not sure if I misunderstood or if that &quot;plotline&quot; just got dropped, because in the end he only ever went on a date with one, the story apparently preferring to spend its time on stuff such as a cringeworthy mentoring sequence.<br />
<br />
There were no eligible male characters other than the mc, because conveniently the mc was a shut-in pussy and therefore not even a token friend was required. There were traces of serious character development (or if there were more than just traces I&#039;m in denial because of how bad it was), but in the end everyone is fodder for comedy or sex appeal, which is not a criticism per se. Of course, the show fails to be funny, and the fanservice wasn&#039;t laid thick enough to carry it for 12 episodes either. Sora (I think that was the name of the low-energy girl) was the only thing I found passably funny with any consistency.<br />

    Story (6/10) - Let us thank AMVs, were it not for them, I would never have found this cute little show. This 12-episode little gem is heartwarming by how far a high-school shut-in will go to help three little girls achieve their dream. I only give the story a 6 because, even though it didn&#039;t really grab my attention throughout, doesn&#039;t mean it didn&#039;t for someone else.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10) - The animation, much like others, was very-well done.<br />
<br />
Sound (6/10) - Seeing as how this is a Music-based anime, it&#039;s what you&#039;d expect. The songs weren&#039;t bad, I just had a tendency to skip them and move-along

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267987">
        with the story.<br />
<br />
Character (6/10) - Not really sure what I can say about the typical nice-guy helps little girls scenario, except what one might expect.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10) - This was a good show. Had a nice few tender moments outside the world of music.<br />
<br />
Overall (6.4/10) - Despite my seemingly-harsh review, this was an anime that I enjoyed throughout, and makes me hopeful for all the other anime that I&#039;ll discover this year.

    This may contain minor spoilers. I really think this anime was fun to watch. Please don&#039;t overlook it because, &quot;Oh, there&#039;s loli&#039;s in it&quot;. <br />
<br />
Story: For starters, the story is fair. 6/10 is what I give it.<br />
<br />
Kyou Nukui is a first year high school student hikikomori. His hobby is making vocaloid songs and uploading them online. One day, he receives a message from a fan asking if they could meet up with him. At the meeting place, three elementary school girls were waiting for him. The three of them want to form a band and ask for Kyou&#039;s help. The anime plays out from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258685">
        I give it a 6/10. I felt the glint from the characters eyes was a bit distracting. Made them stand out though. So, I didn&#039;t complain there. It was rough on the eyes at times. I feel later in the series it&#039;s even worse with quality. That didn&#039;t affect me much from enjoying the show at all. The style design for this anime looked to be done by someone who&#039;s in a rush or doesn&#039;t feel motivated to bring out the best in these characters. Just a feeling though. Average work.<br />
<br />
Sound: Like the art grade, also a 6. It did have a rough go with quality at times. The music was splendid however/on cue with the story/timing. So I couldn&#039;t say anything negative there. My favorite moment was the storm. The rain, heavy winds, banging noises, etc was spot on. Felt like I was actually in it. <br />
<br />
Character/Characters: Now to me, the reason I like this anime a lot was the characters. A lot of folk were looking at me like, &quot;you lolicon&quot;. You may call me one, don&#039;t care. I&#039;m watching to see how the characters perform. So here goes with my detail explanation about them. <br />
<br />
Kyou Nukui: Apparently had a troubled past with bullying and stayed home from high school in the beginning of this anime. Boy, I can relate to him. I too had bullying problems when I grew up and was attending school. It was never fun, drives you to the brink. Anyway, I respect Kyou for taking his mind off of that and doing what he loves, making music. For me, it&#039;s watching anime/reviewing for fans like myself. It helps me take my mind off the world/smile. I respect Kyou as the series progresses he learns to become stronger and accept reality. Let the past go and continue living. He didn&#039;t do it alone either in making his decision. He had help.<br />
<br />
Jun Gotou: 10 years old, 5th grade. What&#039;s there to complain? She&#039;s a character. So stating she&#039;s a loli, is quite obvious. I personally liked Jun a lot as a whole. Believed she had wonderful character growth in this anime.<br />
She tends to act nervous around people she doesn&#039;t understand or know. Which is quite understandable. I think she needed a voters confidence which she gained help from her peers, Kyou, family. I admired her will to ask Kyou for help in the formation of the band. She demanded much from him. But what&#039;s wrong with asking for help when it&#039;s needed? It helps you learn. Which is why I was impressed with Jun. She grew to stand up for herself, be bold. It certainly was fun to witness. <br />
<br />
Sora Kaneshiro: A strange one. Her eyes 90% of the time were expressionless. At first, I didn&#039;t think I would like her. But her two thumbs up gig when she felt the mood, not to mention dozing off when it mattered. Made me smile/laugh at her presence. I wish I had Sora&#039;s ability to fend of bugs and other monstrous things. To me, she&#039;s the weakest link in character growth. Only part she plays is the encouragement of being their for her family/band. Oh and to pick on Kyou when it counts. Ha, ha. <br />
<br />
Nozomi Momijidani: When she introduced herself I felt she had a very unusual last name. But it explains why by the midway point of the series. Shaky family business. Something Nozomi wouldn&#039;t open mindedly discuss. If you exclude Sakura, she was the older sister type to me. She played it well. Always nagging, defending her family. She teased Sakura for the majority of it. Like Sora and Jun she wanting to become better too. <br />
<br />
Sakura Toriumi: I fell for her immediately. Her past intertwines with Kyou&#039;s. Explains also why she&#039;s had a crush on him since middle school/Kyou&#039;s class project assignment presentation. He was bullied, she defends him. Her classmates back off from her tough demeanor. She hides the fact she&#039;s playing two sides to this tale until later on. Watch and you&#039;ll find out what I mean. Still when she begins opening up to Kyou, it&#039;s a real treat. I like her passion for fishing. She enjoys the opportunity out near water than anyone else in the group. Picked that habit off from Masayoshi/Master, competing with him all the time when they are out. I think Sakura is really terrible at keeping her feelings together. Wished she was involved more. But this anime centers around our 3 5th grade MC girls. <br />
<br />
Kurumi Nukui: Kyou&#039;s sister. Voiced by the lovely Rina Hidaka who voices Silica from SAO. Man I enjoyed her. Jealous out of every corner. The pouting, the expressions. It was a real treat. I do like how she plays the piano but believes she is lacking in ability. I think she suggest it&#039;s boring and wonders if what her brother is doing is more lively. The biggest reason I like her in this anime as a support character is her will to look out for those she cares about. Like Kyou, Sora, Jun and Nozomi. She does throw a tantrum if not shown attention. Once again huge with jealousy. I enjoy characters most when they show it. <br />
<br />
Koume Ogi: Our loli friend who hides behind a PC in the beginning when exchanging messages with Kyou on his work/art. I must admit, I was fooled with who she really was. Involving Yuzuha like she did. Imagining her, but better. T_T. All is revealed in good time though. It&#039;s revealed she too is jealous. Likes Kyou a lot and wants nothing more than to continue to make art with him. I&#039;m glad she overcame her position/troubles in the anime too. Please watch if you wish to know what I mean. <br />
<br />
Yuzuha Algae: She plays well with deceiving others. She believed to be a servant family to Koume&#039;s and will respect her wishes at all times. I didn&#039;t think highly of her much. Please watch to find out for yourself, if interested. <br />
<br />
Last character is Masayoshi Sawatari: I&#039;m just glad he gave the girls a home and supported them throughout their decisions. The characters were a fun batch to witness and I feel it deserves an 8/10. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: A 7/10. To be honest, I didn&#039;t know what I was walking myself into. My twitter mates thought so too. That it was unusual of me. But hey, things do happen. Changes are made. That&#039;s life. I enjoyed this anime more than it leads on to believe. Reminds me a lot of Fukumenkei Noise from the Spring season. Making a band, forming it, making music, practicing. It all brings tremendous feels. Never easy. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: I give it well deserved 7/10. Like any anime series out there that only receives 12 EP&#039;s. If chances were it was 20+, I feel this show could&#039;ve been an 8/10 or even 9/10. Involve more character growth too which is one of my biggest things I look at when watching anime. Story applies with any anime you watch. It&#039;s music. Sure they could do more with that too. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading. I really type fast when relaying my thoughts. I really wish I had myself an editor/a person who was there to help with this.<br />
<br />
Also, I respect criticism given to my thoughts. Helps me learn. Don&#039;t hold back please.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m on twitter by the name of KnownAsVirtual.<br />
<br />

    Story: I actually really liked this story. A Shut in Neet (Nukui) helping a group of girls with problems of their own as well. In helping the girls they&#039;re actually helping Kukui in return. Add in the girls &quot;Older Sister&quot; (Sakura) and her having some kind of past with Nukui we get some pretty decent back story and development from all of these characters.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: I have no problems at all with the Art or Animation. I thought it was fantastic. I liked the details in the lips of the females and the small details the put into each characters design.<br />
<br />
Sound and VA&#039;s: I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258668">
        mean the music was great, the Op and Ed were both really good, and the voice acting was fantastic. Again nothing wrong in this category.<br />
<br />
Characters: Nukui is another neet character who a lot of people can relate too especially when it comes to people who have been bullied in the past and just did not want to face the real world. Sakura I thought would be a typical tsundere pig-tailed character but she actually turns out to be pretty freaking awesome. Add in the three cute main girls with three other cute girls later on in the series and you have a pretty decent cast of characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The only thing that ruined my enjoyment of this anime at times was the times it would go over the line. Basically Loli Fanservice...not a fan whatsoever, especially when it comes to sexually explicit moments.<br />
<br />
Overall: As a music anime and a slice of life anime I would definitely recommend this show. However if you cannot deal with Loli fan service and feel like they do go way over the line, this show may not be for you.
