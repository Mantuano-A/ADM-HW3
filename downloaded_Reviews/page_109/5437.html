    Title: The Skull Man<br />
<br />
Manga, Anime: The Skull Man was originally a 100-page one-shot story done by Shotaro Ishinomori (famous for Cyborg 008 and Kamen Rider), released in Shonen Magazine&#039;s 1970 issue, and is cited as one of manga&#039;s first anti-heroes.  Ishinomori did a rework of it just before he started work on the live-action show Kamen Rider (translated as Masked Rider) in 1971, as Toei wanted to use it for the basis of the show, and it was just a bit too dark and gory for a kid&#039;s show.  And then in 1997, just before his death, he contacted Kazuhiko Shinamoto with plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1246">
        points for a remake that would have a continuing storyline and have more complex artwork than the original.  This version was released by Media Factory, and ran from April 7th, 1998 to May of 2001.  The latest version is the one that Tokyopop picked up Stateside; the seventh and final volume was released August 12th, 2003.<br />
<br />
The anime itself was done by Studio Bones (famous for Fullmetal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club) and directed by Takeshi Mori (famous for the Gunsmith Cats and Otaku no Video OVAs, both of which you&#039;ve probably never heard of) .  It ran on Japanese TV from April 28th, 2007 to July 22nd, 2007, and has yet to be licensed at this point time.<br />
<br />
Story: Mkay, so the episode kicks off with this guy on TV lecturing about how medicine and the military are becoming too closely entwined, even after the war, then cuts to woman being chased by these demon-dog-looking things, and a guy in a leather trench coat, a cravat, and a skull mask. <br />
<br />
Turns out that she ends up murdered, and there&#039;s been other reports of incidents like this involving the dogs and the skull mask man in Ootomo City, and a newspaper reporter (Hayato) wants to go and investigate it. He ends up picking up a bit of an annoying brat named Kiriko, getting put under surveillance, and going back to his old hometown, which is just outside of Ootomo. After he gets kicked out of his house in the evening by Kiriko for accidentally seeing her naked, he sees a guy get attacked by the skull mask man and the demon dogs.<br />
<br />
From there, the rest of the series is spent trying to find out who the Skull Man is, and what it is that he wants, which leads into all sorts of interesting things.<br />
<br />
I was worried here, for a bit.  Most of the series is spent building and building up the mysteries around the Skull Man and the involvement of various organizations within the town and conspiracy upon conspiracy upon conspiracy that I was afraid it was not going to touch on any of them, like Rozen Maiden, or would end up falling victim to poor pacing and try to use a deux ex machina to take care of things or be handled sloppily, like in Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament.  Luckily, I was wrong; things start coming together in the tenth episode, and are fully explained in the eleventh and expounded on further in the twelfth episode, which set everything up for the final episode, which wrapped things up perfectly.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll see a lot of elements of V for Vendetta and the Count of Monte Cristo in the story, and mentions of Nietzsche, Wagner, and Shakespeare.  It&#039;s these elements, along with the way pacing was handled, that makes this such a good show.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not without its rough spots, though.  It&#039;s hard to remember all the characters&#039; names, and I usually ended up referring to them either by their job, or by their relation to the main characters if I couldn&#039;t remember their given names.  They bring up some elements, toss them aside for a few episodes, and then bring them up again just as you forget about them, which annoyed me a bit.  And it seemed all nice and resolved in the last episode, up until I watched the bit after the ED, which practically screams for a second season, or at least an OVA for explanation.<br />
<br />
Art: The art for this is overwhelmingly dark in its tones.  The designs for the monsters are very well done, too, even when they end up showing en masse later in the series.  However, when CG is used, it stands out quite a bit, and ends up looking a bit unattractive.<br />
<br />
Music: The OP is this awesome little rock piece, and seems more like something you&#039;d hear in  an older show, which is a nice touch, and very singable.  The background music itself is very noir-ish, and in the case of some pieces, very dramatic at times, but not overly so.  The ED is kind of... eh, as it&#039;s your typical wistful female JPop ballad.<br />
<br />
Seiyuu: Fumiko Orisaka (who also did the voice work for Firiel in Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament and Chise in Saikano) plays one of the main females names who I can actually remember, Maya, and Ayako Kawasumi (also known for her work as Saber in Fate/Stay Night) did the voice work for Kiriko, the other main female whose name I can remember. Also, Toshiyuki Morikawa (who was Sephiroth&#039;s seiyuu) did work for one of the main characters I can&#039;t remember for the life of me.   Also, Hiroshi Tsuchida did the voice work for the Skull Man, which was absolutely outstanding, along the lines of Joji Nakata&#039;s work.  So, overall, outstanding seiyuu here.<br />
<br />
Length: Perfect.  Any longer, and it probably would&#039;ve had to resort to filler, which just wouldn&#039;t have fit, and any shorter, and it wouldn&#039;t have been able to play things out the way it did.  I would like that sequel/OVA to explain that bit after the ED in the thirteenth episode, though.<br />
<br />
Overall: An excellent story with elements of V for Vendetta, perfect pacing, excellent music and seiyuu, even if it&#039;s hard to keep track of all the characters.  Let&#039;s hope they expand on that bit after the thirteenth episode&#039;s ED, though.<br />

    This is based on an old manga by the legendary Ishinomori Shotaro, which would later pave way for Kamen Rider. Despite that, it is very much different from that series. The Skull man is a background character shrouded in mystery as well as why people turn into monsters. The anime is very slow if you don&amp;rsquo;t give it much attention, it isn&amp;rsquo;t really action oriented and emphasizes more on cracking the case, and yet defining what true evil is and covers a lot of philosophical and social issues on a local to international level such as corruption in relation to martial law and organized religion.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8631">
        It takes awhile to really develop the characters but the wait is worth it. Because some of the main characters are adults at a certain age, the only thing they have left to develop is a defining moment in their life that will define their respective careers or something like that. But if you give it your full attention, it will be fast and you will be fascinated at the plot twists and resolutions it delivers, and how it loosely connects to another creation of Ishinomori-sensei. Due to the nature of this anime being mystery and suspense, I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to give away much because I believe this is one of those things you really have to watch.<br />
<br />
What kind of disappointed me about this anime is that very little of the character design is faithful to the style of Ishinomori-sensei like how the recent Cyborg 009 was, but there are some that obviously are faithful at specific times. He had this distinct way of drawing that further helped define what anime and manga is today, and I felt a large portion of that was absent and that a majority of the design didn&amp;rsquo;t really come across as distinguishing. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a modern day interpretation to his art style, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I felt that Ishinomori-sensei should have been owed that much. However, some of the design of later characters are also very unique and faithful to his art style, but once again, that&amp;rsquo;d be a spoiler and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that too much since it relates to that other creation he did. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I loved the monster design and the design of the Skull man himself. You can easily tell that not only just story wise, but in an artistic sense, how this paved way for Kamen Rider such as his fondness of motorcycles, the scarf, and the martial arts action that is present in certain times. The action is exciting and intense and it picks up in the 2nd half of the series. It&amp;rsquo;s high octane but not excessively over the top or ridiculous, clich&amp;eacute;, or cheesy like in tokusatsu. However, it is quite bloody, but not necessarily gory like in the recent Rambo film. <br />
<br />
What I also found very unique is that even though some of the vehicles and the architecture are very modern, they still use some old fashioned items such as audio tapes and records to represent some feeling of the old school influence and to probably give the viewer a possible sense in time it could take place in. I also liked when they showed vehicles, it was in the cel-shading style that the recent Initial D seasons and Wangan Midnight uses and it blends very excellently. <br />
<br />
One of the best traits this anime has is its soundtrack. I love the opening theme sung by the band Tokio. It is really intense as well as the scenery in the song. But I felt that because it is nearly 40 years old, I felt that some of the soundtrack could have been a little old school with the use of the instruments. But the music for the most part is very dark and eerie and gives a noir and horror like feel to the show. The ending theme I felt was kind of out place with this anime though it is a nice song. I felt it belonged more in a shoujo anime that a graphic and cerebral one like this. In the same way, I guess you can say it felt out of place like the ending theme in Elfen Lied though they are still good songs. <br />
<br />
Hayato, the main character is played by Yasumura Makoto. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know much about him. But I thought he did a great job as a tabloid reporter who knows how to get his scoop. He can be funny, and he can be serious. And Kiriko is played by Kawasumi Ayako, who plays Natsuki in Initial D. Her voice in this role in comparison to Natsuki is more childish and higher pitched. In addition to these two, the cast has some pretty big names. Like Tomokazu Seki, who played a lot of roles such as Miyata from Hajime no Ippo and Kenichi from History&amp;rsquo;s Strongest Disicple Kenichi plays the detective assigned to follow Hayato. In comparison to his other roles, he sounds a whole lot more gruffy which I felt was awkward for his high pitched voice, but later got accustomed to it and further expands his talents. And further elaborating who is in this anime and who plays who is another spoiler which I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into and feel you should watch it.<br />
<br />
Even though this paved way for Kamen Rider, don&amp;rsquo;t expect Kamen Rider. In comparison, this series is much darker, gruesome, and more though provoking, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really try to mess with your head. I really want to explain the nature of Skull man&amp;rsquo;s character, but it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult for me to say in this review because this is truly an anime I want you to see for yourself, and I hope you watch this with high expectations that this is truly something unique and distinctive. It is very engagingly philosophical with very effective unpredictability, and exciting action. It has many themes that everybody can relate to or reflect upon.<br />

    I&#039;ve been itching to write a review for this anime. I finished it just a few hours ago, and it left a (pretty darn) big impression on me.<br />
<br />
Story: The story revolves around a young man named Hayato, who decides to revisit his old hometown and look into the mysteries revolving around the masked murderer, &quot;The Skull Man.&quot; It is only later on that he finds himself and his female partner, Kiriko, deeply involved in the dealings of The Skull Man, and something must be done to stop these events from happening.<br />
<br />
The story holds HEAVY religious mention I would want to say that it was an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25969">
        undertone, but oh gosh would I be wrong. The entire story revolved around two religions, and their views. Now, I found this topic very interesting: its rare that you see it in anime, nowadays. The plotline easily intrigued me from the very beginning, and new twists and turns seemed unexpected which I loved. Obvious anime are never fun. And so, I would give the story a 9. The pacing was very fast as times, given the amount of episodes it had, so its one of those anime that you really couldn&#039;t let your mind wander away from. First they&#039;re talking about The White Bell Association, and the next thing you know they&#039;ve delved into the past of something relating to the Association who&#039;s name you missed (one of my experiences, actually. xD;  ) So the story was unbelievably unique and compelling, but I would have to give it a 9 due to its execution.<br />
<br />
Art: If you&#039;re a BONES fan, you will get a g-r-e-a-t vibe of Wolf&#039;s Rain mixed with Darker Than BLACK from the characters. The designs were simple, yet colorful, and the design for the Skull Man himself was neat. I would not say that this art is groundbreaking, but it certainly mixed well with the storyline. A bit of eyecandy here and there for the fights, but otherwise, nothing hugely special. It recieves an 8 from me.<br />
<br />
Sound: The soundtrack was a neat combination of classic jazz and orchestral speedy pieces. Overall, the music sounded nice together, but it didn&#039;t make me stop and think, &quot;This music fits PERFECTLY with this scene.&quot; The Opening theme was certainly one of the catchier songs I have heard in awhile, but the Ending theme was slow: real slow. Is it only me who can&#039;t stand slow ending songs? I mean I know its the end of the episode, boo-hoo, but if you&#039;re going to make an ending that makes the fans lose interest, why bother? Thus, it recives only a 7 from me.<br />
<br />
Character: I LOVED the characters to death in this series. Hayato and Kiriko are easily two of the coolest anime characters out there, and the Skull Man&#039;s intent, though slightly evil, was mesmorizingly great. It added an air of mystery to the guy, which was a nice touch. Also, there is an old man in this anime who basically makes an appearance in every episode (with good reason, after who he is revealed as by the final episode) and he is just a riot. Not only is he cunning, but he also has a sense of humor, and, by the final episode, a classic intent for revenge. I think I liked his character the most, even if he was a supporting role. Character gets a 10 from me!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Looking at the anime overall, I really, truly enjoyed it from the depths of my soul. It was an anime that was so unique, it was simply gripping and thrilling. I loved practically every minute of it right up until the final episode. Well, if you&#039;re a BONES fan, you&#039;d know what a BONES ending is usually like: rushed, left open, and leaving the audience thinking, &quot;What the HECK just happened here?!&quot; Really. I honestly believe it to be BONES&#039; most confusing ending ever created by them.<br />
Now, that&#039;s not to say that it doesn&#039;t make total sense. One of my pet peeves is when people say, &quot;This made NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!&quot; Well of course it made sense, just not in a context which you can think of. And its apparent that you&#039;re too lazy to Google some discussion on its ending.<br />
I always looks forward to an ending by Studio BONES, because I love deciphering them if I don&#039;t understand it. If I can&#039;t figure it out at all, I look to Google and lurk through forums discussing said ending. I&#039;ve been doing it ever since I&#039;ve started watching BONES stuff: some of their endings can be rather thought-provoking, you know. <br />
Anyways, I can honestly say that I sat in my chair for five minutes after the final episode ended, completely dumbfounded and lacking any sort of answer to its ending. So, I went to Google. I shall not spoil anything, but I will say this: be familiar in Ishinorii Shotaro&#039;s works if you plan on watching this. Apparently, the ending is some sort of prologue to another of his works, and some of his original characters make an appearance in the anime. Who doesn&#039;t love pointing out those? =D<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. Its issue for me was mainly its pacing, seeing as I believe it could have gotten the same message out in 24 episodes rather than 13. The ending hints a sequel, which I do hope is on the horizon as well. If the pacing had been perfect, I&#039;d have given it a 10. But alas, it recieves a 9 from me.<br />
If you really love detective work, views on religion, supernatural occurences, AND a totally win opening song by TOKIO, then you should really check out this anime. =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!

    The thing which initially drew me into watching this anime was the poster for it. The skullman kneeling in a pool of blood. When I first saw that glorious picture I thought to myself, &quot;yes! this is going to be legendary!&quot;...little did I know that this would be the hope which propelled me into watching the whole series and not to drop it half way through. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
The anime starts by introducing the characters and setting the mystery at hand, which is good. It doesn&#039;t just drop you into the story without any explanation. However, as I continued to finish one episode and go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131553">
        onto another, I felt a sort of heaviness. This was because I had the preconceived notion that this anime was going to be action packed, and due to this dissapointment, one after another in the first 9 episodes I felt like stabbing myself in the face with a spork. Contrary to what I thought it would be, the first 9 eps reminded are a has a more mystery-drama air to it. It&#039;s only from episodes 10 to 13 that things start to pick up pace and all the pieces fall into place. For example, you now receive the intriguing action scenes you had been waiting for, you&#039;re now at the edge of your seat and you cannot wait to click onto the next episode. These last 4 episodes were what really saved the anime for me. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, don&#039;t go into this thinking it&#039;s going to be action packed from the very beginning because it&#039;s not! If I had known this beforehand, I would have probably enjoyed this anime a lot more instead of constantly being disappointed for 9 episodes straight. However, it is still a very good anime. If you like mystery dramas which then turn very dark and somewhat &#039;traumatic&#039; with good fighting/action scenes close to the end, you&#039;ll like this. <br />
(it&#039;s pace is sort of like in &#039;higurashi&#039;, it slowly builds up but then the ending is absolutely brilliant!)

    “Edgy Kamen Rider”? You wouldn’t be wrong, in fact, we’d be quite congruous. The concepts of Ishinomori Shotaro are what pushed what would become Kamen Rider forward and into the public eye. I can’t help but poke around and find this show very similar in many respects to the latest foot into the Samurai Jack franchise, both creators penned an idea that was censored and had its vision change to a different audience, and both made series afterwards that were more true to their original creation - Ishinomori has gone down and said this is the closest to the original spirit of his design. What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338835">
        does it do to separate itself from its nescient precursor? Quite a lot, and that’s not always a good thing.<br />
<br />
The show itself, produced by studio Bones, is cold and roughly drawn in a dark, almost 90’s comic book-esque way, dim lightning, trench coats everywhere, minimalist animation and filled with so-so characters. Our main protagonist, Hayato Mikogami and Kiriko Mamiya are in a, what the show believes to be, thrilling cat and mouse game hunting a mysterious vigilante figure in this bordering dystopian town known as the: “Skull Man”, who fights those shadows prowling in the night, whether they be man, monster, and even other things entirely?<br />
<br />
I say what the show “believes” to be a cat and mouse game because due to some odd pacing issues, it devolves into less of that and more of a slow and monotonous formula each episode until the last-fourth. While I admittedly came into this show with a conceived notion of seeing a fair bit of action, I love having expectations killed and hung dry in the place of an enjoyable subversion, but it’s less of this and more so of our forgettable cast interviewing and stalking around the city to get information about this mysterious figure. Which brings me to the big guy himself: Skull Man. . . he’s really boring. Don’t get me wrong, he’s amazing to watch on screen but it’s less of spectacularly-animated-action and badass character design that makes him enjoyable, but the fact that you don’t have to watch the bland cast anymore and can watch Bones tear something to hell, which to be fair is, once again, done spectacularly. There’s no reason to truly care about him other than getting a sigh of relief when he shows up because you ironically feel saved yourself when he gores something to shreds.<br />
<br />
Granted, there are some cool elements to the world this show is set in and how the lore of the city itself is interlinked with this Skull figure, a great deal of time is spent setting him up, like a good puppet master or chess player the show is dedicated to meticulously hiding him in the shadows and making not just our protagonist but the viewer get dripples and rations of whatever information you can about him from other characters and scenes. This is by far the best aspect of the show. Furthermore, the show does have some fairly so-so tap dancing around its thematic throughlines, such as political corruption and religious zealotry but in my opinion; it’s less of a throughline and more of a poorly tackled aesthetic that much like the show itself accomplishes little to nothing by the end of it. I oddly find a strange connection with Kyouda, Tomoki who was the episode director who I have referred to as this: “Chess player” writing the show, this is because we have a very similar flaw when playing - we can both get ourselves into the perfect position to win the game - but don’t have the knowledge to execute it a lot of the time and end up a bust.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the show does toy around with some interesting concepts and presents them in a reliable and fashionable manner, but what’s the point when your guides in this world are so cookie-cutter? There is no reason to get attached to these characters in the slightest, they feel like less of people who are obsessed with the Skull Man and more a cast riding his coattails, barely hanging onto his excuse to allow them to be in the show; that is to have them hunting him. Also, this show has an obsession with quoting and referencing philosophy and religion but once again, it’s poorly tacked on and is, in many cases, a non sequitur - no the Skull Man is not Lucifer or something cast down from heaven and attempting to cleanse the world of - please. Please spare me.<br />
<br />
What if our main character was solo, and had a traumatizing memory of this figure as a child? What if they were truly, intrinsically linked together and bound to confront each other eventually? What if this memory drives him to become a detective and do some questionable things for information, all while slowly and surely making him become a target for the creature that he has been chasing after all along due to his moral code becoming corrupted? Doesn’t that sound a lot more fun to you?! Don’t mean to brag, but it sure as hell does to me. This really drives home the main problem with the show. We have the ONLY interesting element dancing in shadows and appearing for 5 minutes each time, and you know what? Even during the times he appears, is weak too. All the mystery about him begins to fade away and that badass image of him you saw on the cover of the show seems less cool and more of an artistic leniency with what is the true character - a generic superhero.<br />
<br />
He’s not a gritty “Grim Knight” Batman and more and more like a cartoon character who can make the hilariously cliche and exaggerated monster of the week bleed and die.I’m super intimidated. The Skull Man overall is trapped in confusing juxtaposition and feels as if it cannot commit to any side of anything it is putting out to the viewer. Is it a methodical and well paced game of hunting a knight of the darkness? Nah, not really. Is it a corny monster of the week brawler with a nocturne paint job? No, because that’s only the last five minutes of every episode before the last three. Some okay voice acting, a dregging OST that doesn’t say or speak much to the tone of the show. Eh?<br />
<br />
Why was this show made? What did it try to tell me about its cast, Kamen Ri- I mean Skull Man, or about politics, religion, etc? Quite honestly, I’d be far more satisfied watching a super sentai series that, while cheese-beyond-belief, does have a consistent throughline in its ideas that it longs to present to the viewer, like Jetman or some other variation. With this in mind, Skull Man fails at what it even set out to do - explore the more censored topics its precursor explored lightly, but didn’t fail at doing entirely like this show did. I cannot with good consciousness recommend it to those who are not prepared to endure a slogging battle of attrition to try and understand and grasp the “deeper” meanings this show plays around with. Hate to break it to you; but it’s not there. Many thanks for reading.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240386">
         a trail of body&#039;s  in his wake.<br />
<br />
<br />
So from what you can tell its one of those anti hero story&#039;s,<br />
Which I am quite a big fan off.<br />
<br />
The story in nut shell is main character is going around town looking for information about this skull man ,<br />
Gets involved in shit that way over his head that involved some secret evil plan etc.<br />
That pretty much the plot there really nothing much to it other than that,<br />
I mean I could go into detail but I don&#039;t think it worth the my time and yours if I am being honest here.<br />
<br />
Because this is probably one of the most boring, done to death anti hero story I have ever seen in my life,<br />
It&#039;s just so predictable and soulless.<br />
<br />
there really isn&#039;t much I can actually comment on about it,<br />
There no themes, no message it&#039;s trying to tell us. <br />
It just mindless action, a pointless mystery that I don&#039;t care about, and boring drama that you couldn&#039;t pay me to care about in the slightest.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s almost  like when writing this they couldn&#039;t come up with any interesting or good ideas so they like hay good writing why do we need this,<br />
So they probably  decided to look up some sort of  check list for how to make the  most bland anti hero story ever,<br />
Ok we got evil cults, mutants, political corruption, a generic moral protagonist, and last and not an bad guy who is a bad guy just because.<br />
Let&#039;s tick that of the list.<br />
<br />
And I know this is one of those re telling of a classic manga series or somethings along Those lines.<br />
And maybe that&#039;s why it kind of dated or bland,<br />
But that&#039;s not an excuse for having a bad plot.<br />
<br />
Like one example of a retelling of a classic Franchise done right,<br />
Is Cassin sins which even if you didn&#039;t watch the original,<br />
It still good even on its own and they actually used good and interesting ideas to mostly there full effect.<br />
<br />
So bottom line that the main problem that no one gave a fuck about the story and everything else included as a whole,<br />
So why should I waste my time or care about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character, 3/10<br />
<br />
Main character hayato is probably one of the most bland main characters  I have ever seen.<br />
His personality traits Are this,<br />
He is just a good guy and that is literally his entire character.<br />
There is Nothing interesting about him.<br />
He pretty much the done to death mah morels type of character.<br />
<br />
<br />
Side characters,<br />
They all have the personality of dry toast.<br />
<br />
Just like the main character there are bland as all fuck,<br />
Nothing interesting or different  about them.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just the one trait they have that makes up there there personality is there entire character.<br />
So there not even characters there just cardboard cutouts.<br />
<br />
So very bad characterization for the for the win I guess.<br />
<br />
Also the skull man character himself Is also the most boring anti hero I have ever  seen in my life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art, 5/10<br />
<br />
Probably one of better things of this show.<br />
<br />
The animation looks fine very passable,<br />
Back grounds are kind of average.<br />
<br />
Very boring fights that aren&#039;t animated well or have good fight choreography.<br />
<br />
The style of the show which I would think try&#039;s capture this retro feel,<br />
But Fails in that regard.<br />
I don&#039;t really now what it is,<br />
But it just has this feeling of very stiff felling to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character designs are shit,<br />
And most of the characters  look the fucking same,<br />
Half the time I didn&#039;t even know who who half the time.<br />
<br />
But I kind of liked the design for the skull man outfit,<br />
Because it kind of cool to me.<br />
<br />
Sound, 5/10 <br />
<br />
The like the opening song,<br />
Th ending for me is kind of boreing.<br />
<br />
The ost is kind of boreing as well,<br />
Like there really much I can actually comment on.<br />
<br />
Voice acting for the sub is fine.<br />
There is no dub.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, 3/10<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the op and that about it,<br />
Like a enjoyed a few of the fights.<br />
<br />
But other that those things there really isn&#039;t much I could comment in the enjoyment sense of things.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just a very ber bones anime which doesn&#039;t have much going for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, 3/10<br />
<br />
If your new to anime and you have nothing else to watch,<br />
Then don&#039;t watch this because it&#039;s not worth it.<br />
You can find it what this show dose better else where.<br />
If you like the skull man Franchise then maybe you would like it,<br />
But I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath.<br />
<br />

    I thoroughly enjoyed Skull Man. I found it randomly when I was surfing the internet and usually when that happens I don&#039;t find such good quality. There were some issues finding subbed episodes and places that had all of it but once I found a place I sat down and watched it. It&#039;s very confusing so I don&#039;t recommend that you just watch it every once in awhile. The plot has a very interesting layout and all of the characters are well defined but not so well as to give away much of what is to come. It&#039;s one of the first really mysterious and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16008">
        suspenseful anime&#039;s I&#039;ve watched but overall I enjoyed it.

    The story of Skull Man is an oh-so important one, the character is not only one of the first anti-heroes in anime history, whose design would later be the inspiration for the titular hero in Kamen Rider, but this series contains crucial subtext about Japan&#039;s political affairs. Shōtarō Ishinomori&#039;s Skull Man is a tale for the ages, it has the same gravitas as some of the most profound literary classics, though, sadly, is not as known in English-speaking countries as much as it should be.<br />
<br />
⚠️ This review of Skull Man will contain spoilers ⚠️<br />
<br />
—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
Until I watched this series, I had only seen Shōtarō Ishinomori&#039;s &quot;Android

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377015">
        Kikaider&quot;! The &quot;Kikaider&quot; story is one of the first things that really got invested in anime. I caught it on Adult Swim in elementary school (during fifth grade), and I even remember being in tears by the last episode of the OVA series, the very night that &quot;FLCL&quot; first aired on the network! I really love that show, Jiro will always have a special place in my heart, and I still feel a surge of emotions when I hear the opening theme: &quot;Theme of Gemini&quot;!<br />
<br />
With that being said, Skull Man&#039;s continuity is linked to Cyborg 009&#039;s, and despite having only seen miscellaneous episodes of the 2003 version during Cartoon Network re-runs, I was still able to be completely absorbed in the piercing plot line of Skull Man. There are some allusions to events in Cyborg 009, that I will mention the further down we go into this review, but it isn&#039;t until the end of the last episode that the big reveal happens. I&#039;m not sure if I would have had a more passionate reaction to the ending if I had been a Cyborg 009 fan, but the strife that Hayato Mikogami is forced to undergo to get there was enough to leave me flabbergasted.<br />
<br />
The narrative starts out with the aforementioned main character returning the the town he grew up in (&quot;Ōtomo City&quot;), to research the correlation in a chain of mysterious murders and the cloaked suspect, Skull Man! There, he encounters a quirky girl (&quot;Kiriko Mamiya&quot;) that he befriends and also reunites with a childhood friend from his old orphanage, Yoshio Kanzaki, who has become a Catholic priest in the time that they spent apart. In a beautifully choreographed reveal, after the narrative becomes rife with various complexities, Hayato learns that his childhood friend, Yoshio, is actually the eponymous Skull Man and who had become a vigilante after serving as a chaplain in the Vietnam War.<br />
<br />
After Yoshio&#039;s passing, Hayato takes the mantel of Skull Man and finds the truth of the wicked city to be much worse than he originally imagined! The noir mystery morphs into a full-out battle against the nefarious &quot;Ōtomo Group&quot; — partnered with a multinational corporation, known as Brain Gear! Hayato learns through coded Nietzschean quotes and revelations left by his late friend, Yoshio, the philosophy between good and evil. <br />
<br />
The puppet-masters of the town are not above controlling political figures and the police, as well as performing horrific human experiments and committing covert crimes, to exploit the people of the town. After witnessing such treachery, Skull Man becomes BLACK GHOST... a radical terrorist leader in Cyborg 009, who also is the biological father to Joe Shimamura! It seems very similar to Darth Vader&#039;s role in &quot;Star Wars&quot;! The story ends with the Skull Man forfeiting his own humanity, for the greater good, and during some chilling final shots, the plot reveals that corruption and the brainwashing of civilians is still flourishing in Ōtomo City! It&#039;s a bittersweet ending, because it was nice to see Hayato on his death throes, still living — but, it&#039;s unclear what is left of his soul.<br />

Commentary: Mr. Mori knows how to make some scenic and eye-catching animation shots, his work on &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot; is enough evidence to prove his valor, on that front! Amazing work, Skull Man was riveting from start to finish!<br />
<br />
Good Seiyū Work = ✅<br />

* Susumu Yamazaki, Uchū Senkan Yamato 2199 ✅✅<br />
* Daikichi Kawachi, Usagi Drop ✅✅✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: His baritone-like inflection as the masked anti-hero is similar to his role as Keigo Ōnishi in &quot;Texhnolyze&quot; — every time I think of that character, the last four episodes and the part he plays in it, are crystal clear in my mind! Mr. Tsuchida was an incredible Skull Man!<br />
<br />
Makoto Yasumura as Hayato Mikogami, notable roles:<br />
* Johnny Beppu, Aikatsu! ✅✅✅<br />
* Shu Satomura, Bakegyamon<br />
* Terumichi Nishida, Detroit Metal City ✅✅✅<br />
* Kento Yamada, Koneko no Chi: Ponponra Daibōken (&quot;Chi&#039;s Sweet Home&quot;)<br />
* Ken Mayumura, Major (series)<br />
* Spring Mustache, One Punch Man (series) ✅<br />
* Shōji Suyama, Ōkiku Furikabutte (&quot;Big Windup!&quot;)<br />
* Yōsuke Fukazawa, Over Drive<br />
* Koron-kun, Pururun! Shizuku-chan (series)<br />
* Fumihiko Matsumaru, Rec ✅<br />
* Shōzō Tadokoro, Rinne no Lagrange (series)<br />
* Zorube, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (series) ✅<br />
* Ryūhei Suga and Hayato Tani, School Rumble<br />
<br />
Commentary: I would compare the role as Hayato Mikogami to Mr. Yasumura&#039;s performance as Fumihiko Matsumaru in &quot;Rec&quot;, because of how unfettered and carefree the character comes across as, from the start. I think the more comedic voice was privy in showing the transformation within Hayato, over the course of a meager thirteen episodes. Great job!<br />

Commentary: Yes, the goofball sidekick to Hayato has Saber&#039;s voice (&quot;Fate/stay night&quot;)! Her cadence is very charming, I felt myself being drawn in by her charisma, despite her design looking like a monkeyish Son Gokū type of girl, with a beret. Absolutely amazing performance, as always!<br />

* Kenji Makabe, Uchū Kyōdai (&quot;Space Brothers&quot;) ✅✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: I would compare Mr. Katō&#039;s performance as Yoshio to his role as Kenji Makabe in &quot;Uchū Kyōdai&quot;, because he has the same kind of sedate, forthright demeanor in both shows! Very powerful performance, and in my opinion the MOST captivating voice acting role in his entire filmography!<br />
<br />
The ending of Skull Man had a very powerful effect on me, we had bought the standard DVD set from Sentai Filmworks on a whim, and this series became a favorite in the sleepless night that I consumed it. It&#039;s a shame that it never got a BD remaster, because, as you would expect from Studio Bones, the animation and visual direction is top-notch! And it doesn&#039;t fall into the usual pratfalls that Bones&#039; writers typically stumble into, with the storyline becoming a damp line of toilet paper mid-way through! The halfway points of series like &quot;Star Driver&quot;, &quot;Wolf&#039;s Rain&quot;, and &quot;Gosick&quot; (etc.) were weaker than the first and last episodes, but Skull Man stays consistent in its delivery! I rate Skull Man a solid 7/10!<br />
<br />

    Yet another hugely underrated anime<br />
the skull man is a refreshing story of man versus fear<br />
and right from the very beginning you can tell how awesome the plot is going to be<br />
true to its genre skull man gives off a nice complement to tragedy mixed with hardcore action, and a magnitude of gore thrown in for good measure, different from other anime of the same genre, skull man is made for mature audience, I find that clearly evident in the fact that it could provide its own taste of Realism as the story progresses to its final part<br />
<br />
all combined, you get a nearly-crafted masterpiece<br />
I myself enjoyed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57371">
        this show, and I could safely say that I was left with something good as it ended<br />
<br />
I just cannot wait for another release as the ending was a major tease :)

    This had been something I&#039;ve wanted to watch for a while, having first watched the promo years ago right before it aired; unfortunately, never managed to catch it when it first came out. <br />
<br />
This was definitely an extraordinary series, with rich scenes and a wonderful musical score to boot. This brought me back to the days of Lupin and other mystery/suspense series that I enjoyed some time ago. The cast was quite colorful and the setting was an interesting change of pace. I did a bit of reading on this, and hadn&#039;t realized this was supposed to be a prequel for the Cyborg 009 series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22169">
        (it sets up the events that take place before and give birth to its main antagonist). <br />
<br />
The series was solid, with great action, fluid animation and very human characters. I liked the supernatural element that was injected throughout the series, and you would often be caught off-guard when things got pretty dark. It was fun experience. Though the ending left you wanting more and feeling a bit left down. It felt rushed, and with only 13 episodes for the series, you can&#039;t help but feel a little disappointed. Overall, it packed a punch, but the end is what prevents me from giving it any higher a score.
