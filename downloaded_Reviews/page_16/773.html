    Kageki Shojo took me by pleasant surprise. As a huge Love Live and idol stan, I was obviously going to give it a watch. What I was not expecting was such a competent story about the darker aspects of show-business and the pressure that many girls are under to succeed in the industry. By week two, it was by far my most anticipated show of the week and I loved it so much I couldn’t help but go out and by every volume of the manga.<br />
<br />
So, firstly, Kageki Shojo isn’t an idol show per se, it’s more of an acting show and follows girls from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418282">
        various artistic backgrounds coming together to study the performing arts. That’s a bit of a different take on the usual girl idol group team-up to save a dying school formula we often get. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but it’s nice to have something unique. Episode 1 is your usual cutesy pilot style set up, but from episode 2 onward the show really gets going and at points gets surprisingly dark. Offering realistic, but hard to watch depictions of sexual harassment, grooming, eating disorders and child abuse. Yea, this isn’t your usual Revue style set up. I was also amazed by how much each of the characters was developed over the course of the season. While it’s only 12 episodes, it felt like all of the girls had plenty of time for their arcs. Most are dealing with some sort of trauma from their past that stands in the way of them and achieving their goals. The story satisfactorily provides backstory, conflict and resolution for each making for a very enjoyable story.<br />
<br />
<br />
The artstyle in the show is quite unique. It’s extremely bright and pleasant to look at. It mixes elements of traditional shojo art with a more modern take. I think the voice acting is also great in the show. During some of those darker moments I mentioned earlier, they really add a lot of emotional and depth to scenes.<br />
<br />
I can confidently say that if you enjoy shojo manga and revue/idol shows you’ll find Kageki Shojo to be a very enjoyable watch. Underneath it’s bright and colourful exterior, it deals with very real issues that girls face. While it didn’t have the hype that some shows had this season, it quickly made its way to the top.<br />
<br />
Kageki Shojo gets 10 out of 10.<br />

    It’s rare to see an anime that handles its themes as tactfully and down-to-earth as Kageki Shoujo does. I’ll be honest, going into this anime I had originally dismissed it as another shoujo that was targeted towards a different audience to me. The tall, energetic girl and the short, reserved girl contrast never stood out to me early on, and the setting of a prestigious theatrical school never grabbed my attention either. But then each episode would tackle some new theme or explore some new character, and before I knew it I was drawn in by everything this anime had to offer.<br />
<br />
While the anime does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418281">
        tackle themes such as trauma, stalking, and eating disorders its important to note that this isn’t the sole purpose of the series. It explores the theatrical industry as a whole, and these are only one portion of it. That said, when it does delve into these darker themes it does an incredibly good job at it. Each character was properly explored and easy to understand, providing great insight into some of the thoughts and mentalities of people affected by these issues. When stalking is brought up it is able to give reasons for the stalker’s actions without ever justifying the act of stalking itself. The anime never gives off the impression of being dark for the sake of holding the viewer’s attention, rather it just simply addresses problems that you can find in the real world. You can almost feel the severity and impact of these through the screen, with some characters feeling all too real at times.<br />
<br />
At first the characters might not seem all that complex, but this changes with each passing episode. Numerous well-paced backstories are placed to help better understand the characters, and by the end it really feels like everyone in the show serves a purpose rather than just existing for the sake of it. Character development is great, and a lot of it is shown through acting and performances which was really impressive. Every character has their own goal with their own reasons for seeking it, and you can see them strive for it through their actions. Characteristics of each girl are also reflected in their performances, and emotional moments are blended in with this brilliantly. Breakthroughs in characters become so much more meaningful when there are passionate voice lines during a play going along with it. Rather than having the theatre school as nothing more than a simple setting it becomes a part of the characters’ growth, adding depth and symbolism to the overall story.<br />
<br />
Visuals remained solid throughout the anime, and multiple directing techniques were used to enhance certain scenes. Good camera shots made scenes easy to follow and flow well, and there were some neat uses of subtle lighting at various points, particularly whenever something would take place on stage. Of course, the visuals aren’t breathtaking, but good directing and scene composition makes them stand out despite this. A good soundtrack is used well when it needs to be, and when paired with strong voice acting the entire anime suddenly becomes more impactful. The opening and ending are both great and have managed to stick with me after finishing each episode.<br />
<br />
Never before have I been so interested in watching a play about Romeo and Juliet. I found myself wanting to see more of each character perform, and the anime really delivers on this in the last few episodes. There is visible development with each passing episode and it’s an absolute joy to watch.<br />
<br />
Solid 9/10, time to go watch the Rose of Versailles

    Kageki Shoujo was such an incredible depiction of the acting world and really gave me a lot to think about regarding it, I can safely say it had some of the most realistic and modern drama I&#039;ve ever seen in an animated show all based within a great setting with some fantastic characters to embody it. I really don&#039;t have any issues with this show, it did everything I wanted and was so captivating in doing it.<br />
<br />
The story focuses on this prestigious drama school and our main cast who are admitted to it. From the opening episode the viewer is shown how elite Kouka academy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418547">
        is and you really believe this the whole way through. I cannot stress enough how much this show made me really think about the drama and issues it brought up, pretty much every episode introduces an issue or thinking point about the prestigious world these girls live in and it&#039;s handled in such a scarily realistic way consistently. The characters are portrayed so well in these situations and it&#039;s all so believable that I was just genuinely impressed throughout.<br />
<br />
Speaking more about the characters, most of our main cast have a pretty expansive backstory that is explored throughout the episodes, and they all have their fair share of issues that so many young girls in similar situations in the real world absolutely experience - but it never feels like a trope. They are absolutely written in a way that makes it all seem grounded and you can tell how much they are affected - this isn&#039;t limited to just them either, things the other girls do reflect so much on the others and there is a lot of growth because of this.<br />
<br />
I absolutely love our main two characters Ai and Sarasa - the development between them from start to finish is so heart-warming and is handled so well, especially Ai. Her character is so damn well written, at the start she is struggling with so much and internalises all of it, but she slowly opens up and Sarasa is absolutely the catalyst - without going into spoilers Ai&#039;s backstory is so horrid and unfortunate, but you see how much she grows from it by the end and it&#039;s just so great.<br />
<br />
The art and animation definitely aren&#039;t anything too special but are still really good, everything is very soft and colourful which really sells the idea of Kouka being very pristine and perfect. The soundtrack as well is great throughout, I really love the ED.<br />
<br />
Overall this is an absolute must-watch show, it might not sound interesting from the premise alone but I hope this review was able to hook people into checking it out because you will absolutely not regret it!

    Kageki Shoujo is one of those dramas that attacks directly to your heart through a beautiful sequence of impactful memories and a deep love towards its setting and motive. Through a ride into the backgrounds of accomplished characters there is a consequential presentation of all the struggles that are involved in the pressure of performing, a conscious and meaningful intent to develop a critique to the toxicity presented in the current era and a vivid intention to develop the concept of developing a sense of who we are in order to create something unique and beautiful.<br />
<br />
The set of characters are in a perfect symbiosis, almost

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418325">
        mathematically designed to create gorgeous juxtapositions over their emotions and reflection. From the trauma of being ignored by your family while being superficially accepted from society to the trauma of being denied by your superficial characteristics but being in a warm family circle. From the struggle of being the first and not knowing the light after the tunnel to the struggle of being the natural progression of your family circle and not living up to your own goals. From the struggle of being selfless to the struggle of the unawareness. There is a guarantee that the exploration gets us to those feelings that we can all sort of relate, and that creates perfectly synced relationships in the difference. And to explore what do we love, what do we care about.<br />
<br />
The anime takes no doubts to presents itself in a honest manner, through leaving leaves of mystery and aura of humanity during its runtime, the whole concept goes around understanding the characters and their conflicts, their behavior, by knowing their struggles but to also think about how we would act if we knew them. The mystery of humanity and the dark of how each other are is nothing but perfectly presented here, and it leaves a good message, a beautiful message of understanding. If we are to judge them, we would nothing but be subject to our ignorance, and that is how the real world operates, human. <br />
<br />
The deep affection to the theatrical arts is presented through a respect to the craft. The coherency between the discourse of each character and their way to express themselves leaves us with a gorgeous intent to reflect what goes through the process of doing something unique, something human. To repulse the repetition and to elevate being yourself. While straightforward, the message is nothing but wonderful in terms of practicality and relevant towards how the characters were designed. There is nothing as not being yourself unless you want to be someone else.<br />
<br />
The struggle of succeeding in such arts and whatever craft is also present in a lovely envelope, the pressure from all the potential directions is always shown with delicacy. From not being up to the performance that you should, to never being able to replicate what others do even with your hardest intent, the extremely human expression of what it feels to be the best is there to elevating ourselves to a concept, not everyone can be the star. World is dynamic, a place where everyone is welcomed, and since that is world, the theatrical arts are nothing but a representation of diversity. <br />
<br />
Through all those factors presented each of the developments of the characters creates deeply impactful and dynamic moments. We go from tears to happiness, from laughter to deep sensation of despair in matters of minutes, the events have a magical atmosphere that comes from the fact that they were all nothing but human, honest, authentic, and from love. There is no apparent distortion that produces the everlasting plasticity of fakeness.<br />
<br />
While the art and the animation are nothing spectacular, the delicacy of the motion of the characters is wonderful to see and it does its job right. The dances, the impactful moments, and those moments where the characters must express themselves are done with care, which doubled down with the musical aspect leaves us with a fitting atmosphere to where the characters can truly flourish.<br />
<br />
Sadly, Kageki Shoujo is not a perfect anime, the story gets a little too convoluted and directionless in some sense after the end of the first conflict resolution, and it lacks a bit of elegancy in terms of giving us a concrete reason to explore the backgrounds in some occasions, which doesn’t degrade completely the whole experience anyways. Also, the time structure feels fuzzy, with no clear distinction of how the time passes in many points of the story, which is also an aspect that could have been treated better.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the anime is a correctly done emotional ride with respect to its topics and the sense of humanity, a well-developed drama about human behavior which will leave you with a sense of interest or curiosity about it, since it presents itself as an entire universe of thought complexity, absorbing characters involved in an artistically pleasing setting<br />

    Kageki Shoujo!! is one of the most well rounded anime that I&#039;ve seen. Real issues people face and interesting dynamics. It&#039;s a true pleasure watching everything unfold.<br />
<br />
Story: With a setting of an ultra competitive theatrical school, there&#039;s a lot of potential. Thankfully Kageki Shoujo nails this aspect. You feel the division, competitiveness, and edge that every girl attending is trying to get over the others. There&#039;s very little down time in an episode, every second felt important and captivating. The story is simple yet delicate as it touches on some very important issues and handles them carefully (e.g.: trauma). There is comedy occasionally that I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409757">
        found worked really well except maybe in 1 instance where it was played up a tad too much. 9/10.<br />
<br />
Art: Last thing I expected when I started Kageki Shoujo was beautiful animation. The art and animation pairs perfectly with what&#039;s happening in the story I&#039;m not sure if many studios could do better. From an instructor simply moving her foot to facial expressions in climatic moments, stunning animation at times. For the most part it sits above average though. I loved the character designs; the distant Ai and outgoing Sarasa being my favorite. 9/10.<br />
<br />
Sound: Very enjoyable OST, definitely added to the important scenes. Loved the voice acting which matched the characters perfectly. Both OP and ED were good (though I prefer the ED). 9/10.<br />
<br />
Characters: The most important part in series like this is the characters. I don&#039;t think you can ask for better than what Kageki Shoujo has managed so far. The bread and butter starts with our two mc&#039;s. Ai who is more cold and wants to be alone vs Sarasa, the loud, tall, and caring one. It&#039;s difficult to come up with two more different characters but their dynamic is so enjoyable to watch. They&#039;re both flawed but make up for what the other lacks. What adds to the tension of the series are the other characters. From demanding instructors to more senior students. It adds that very important layer to flesh things out and make it feel &#039;real&#039;. 9/10. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed every second of Kageki Shoujo. It&#039;s not a genre I&#039;ve explored much but it&#039;s impossible to ignore it&#039;s quality across the board. 9/10.

    WARNING: If you’re uncomfortable with the topic of eating disorders, sexual assault, stalking, and potential other issues that face young girls pursuing an acting career, consider not watching this show. However, if you want to see a show that handles and addresses these topics maturely and in a well written manner, then this is a show for you. Also NO MAJOR SPOILERS here<br />
<br />
Kageki Shoujo! Is an excellent show. Potentially, even my anime of the season as wild as that maybe sounds. In a mere 3-4 eps it handles themes exceptionally that several dozen anime either make a joke of, or do try to say something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418279">
        significant about but fail miserably. At several points, it could’ve messed up and become another Wonder Egg Priority, but no it stays consistently great and is easily one of the best modern shoujo I’ve seen.<br />
<br />
<br />
--STORY—<br />
<br />
The way Kageki Shoujo handles its story is very interesting. There’s a main story of following the main girls trying to learn how to act at the Kouka school, but there’s also at least 1 ep dedicated to almost every main girl showcasing their backstory and dealing with various problems or traumas they’ve dealt with. Stuff most anime wouldn’t even touch upon, but this show handles excellently. It can get pretty serious at times, and ep 3 in particular is…dark.<br />
I will say though it’s NOT ALL doom and gloom, if you’re worried about that. There’s plenty of lighthearted and comedic moments so far, and it balances out with the more serious content pretty well. Heck, a few of the eps in the 2nd half are pretty much entirely comedy. And don’t worry there’s no tonal dissonance here nor does it undermine its serious themes for a crappy joke. <br />
<br />
--CHARACTERS—<br />
<br />
Our main protags are Sarasa and Ai. Sarasa is an absolute dork, and I love her. She’s a bundle of energy, and despite her somewhat clumsy and naïve personality she’s always willing to give 100% either towards her dream or helping others. It’s also interesting to see how they tackle her not quite “fitting in” to the environment of the acting school, and her ideals have already been challenged a few times.<br />
<br />
Ai is very much the opposite. I would ask that male viewers not be put off by her “hating all men” attitude, as it’s for a very good reason that’s properly explained by ep 3. She’s cold, distant, and often fakes any positive emotion. She’s a very well done depiction of someone with trauma, and has had great development so far. <br />
<br />
Side cast is also very strong overall. Again, a lot of the girls get at least 1 ep just for them. The show overall is very strong at characterizing everyone well, and who knows maybe your fave in this show won’t even be Ai or Sarasa. <br />
<br />
--ART/ANIMATION—<br />
<br />
There’s not a lot of complex animation going here or anything, but it is consistent and nicely done. There are some very pretty visuals, and well-choreographed scenes. There’s custom ED’s for different girls with unique art even. <br />
<br />
Character designs are pretty nice. Both of the mc’s designs are amazing, and compliment their personalities well. Side cast can maybe be a bit plain looking, but still well done. You’ll also see the characters have different hairstyles or fashion over time, which is a cool detail that not a ton of anime do. <br />
<br />
--MUSIC—<br />
<br />
The OP is pretty catchy, and ED is nice too. Again along with the unique ED’s for each girl, they’ll even have the vas for each girl sing their respective EDs and it’s very well done. General soundtrack is also quite good too, and fits every scene well.<br />
The voice acting, holy the va is excellent. A few scenes made me shiver or tear up a bit just from how well done it is. The casting was near perfect for this show, and there’s so many well done scenes that hit every emotion. Sad, comedic, tense, and important scenes alike the cast delivers. Great singing overall too, I really did enjoy hearing the various EDs. <br />
<br />
--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION—<br />
<br />
So overall do I enjoy Kageki Shoujo? Well yes, but not in the usual way. Obvs people don’t necessarily enjoy watching some of the content addressed in this show, in fact it might be better if some don’t due to again potentially triggering material. However, I always appreciate it when anime or manga tackles mature/uncomfortable topics in a well done manner, and again to clarify there are still plenty of light hearted scenes. Pretty much any scene with Sarasa will make your day. <br />
<br />
I’d absolutely rec this show for any shoujo fan, or just someone looking for something unique in anime. It’s been a pleasure to watch, and is easily an 8.5 or 9/10 show for me. <br />

    Kageki Shoujo! is truly a hidden gem of the summer season and I would recommend this in a heartbeat with one caveat (see below).<br />
<br />
I was truly surprised by the fact that out of all of the series I started this season, this was the one I looked forward to watching every single week. In fact, it was my favorite series this season by far. I literally got chills at times and couldn&#039;t help but root for the main characters as they took one step forward towards realizing their dreams. It almost gives me Skip Beat and Act Age vibes at times as the central focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418394">
        is on drama and acting. <br />
<br />
This anime is unique in the fact that it pushes the boundaries of a frontier that has not really been explored in recent years. It brings up real issues that teens go through in a considerate manner and should be applauded for such a feat. Stereotypically shoujo series has a suspension of reality at moments, but the realism that is depicted in this show is undoubtedly a nice change of pace in the genre.<br />
<br />
Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, I said I would recommend this show with one caveat.<br />
<br />
Despite all of the praise that this show wholeheartedly deserves, you should be aware of one issue that separates this from a masterpiece and might put some people off. There is one episode that gives us a flashback involving one of the main characters. It essentially provides us important insight into the cause of her trauma. As I mentioned before, discussing these heavy topics should be applauded and is not the main issue. <br />
<br />
The issue with this is the fact that the direction and handling of the scene fetishizes the sexual abuse of an underage girl. Now, I understand that if the scene was with a teen, it may slide, but the explicit flashback involves a grown man taking advantage of an extremely young school girl. I am no stranger to x-rated material, but when the scene transpired it left a bad taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
Now I understand lolicon is a part of Japanese media culture, but this scene truly highlights a growing issue that needs to be addressed. If you don&#039;t think it&#039;s a problem, just look up &#039;Act Age Author.&#039;<br />
<br />
Overall, If you can get past the mishandling of this scene, I think Kageki Shoujo! is a show that everyone must watch. Its characters are charming and their progression throughout the story is superb. While open-ended, the ending leaves a smile on your face and you can&#039;t help but wish for more. At the moment there isn&#039;t any indication of a second season but if there is one down the road, sign me up!

    Summer 2021 Tall Girl Supremacy.<br />
<br />
I try to be as non-bias as possible when I write a review, but Kageki Shoujo/Opera Girl is factually top tier, is one of the best shows of the summer season and has definitely cracked the top 10 anime of 2021 list for right now, so you&#039;re just going to have to forgive me whilst I indulge myself this one time. <br />
<br />
The story follows Sarasa Watanabe a tall, happy go lucky cinnamon roll and Ai Narata an emotionless, cold, former J-pop idol as they enter into an all female opera school producing some of the finest Musical and Theatrical Artists Japan

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418651">
        has to offer with the goal of becoming the main stars of a famous all female Musical Theatre Troupe. To get there they&#039;ll have to learn to overcome their sort comings whilst learning with and competing against a cast of success hungry classmates and bitchy sempai&#039;s in a brutally competitive environment which expects nothing but perfection from them. <br />
<br />
This is not an idol anime. Kageki Shoujo is a school/performing arts anime on the surface, but it&#039;s cast of very complex characters and it&#039;s commentary on the extreme and sometimes cruel teaching methods utilised by the performing arts institution (especially towards women) is the real hook of this show. Episode 1 and 2 might give you a soft opening to get you settled in, but episode 3 and beyond presents realist depictions of child grooming, sexual assault, eating disorders, sacrifice and questions of self worth. Seriously Ai&#039;s back story in particular is very hard to sit through and the rest of the show doesn&#039;t hold back on these difficult yet excellently written subjects either.  <br />
<br />
On the flip side, the show is REALLY funny. Once Ai starts to open up she has some of the best gags in the entire show which are helped with certain moments animated with sakuga. Ai&#039;s monotone yet shy personality bounces off Sarasa&#039;s ganki-ness well and they have fantastic scene chemistry. They have both very quickly become two of my favourite characters. These moments of humour really help with the shows excellent pacing without undermining the heavier moments of the story.   <br />
<br />
The animation is solid overall. The sports festival episode was the only time I felt the animation suffered a bit, but honestly it really doesn&#039;t matter too much in a show like this. The colour pallet is bright and crisp, excellent camera shots make the characters pop off the screen and scenes flow smoothly.<br />
<br />
Amongst all the shit I&#039;ve watched this season this show feels like finding a diamond in the rough. I understand that not everyone will agree with my rating or enjoy it as much as I did, but I really hope it gets a second season because it&#039;s certainly the most deserving. <br />
<br />
10/10 Practically Perfect

    Kageki Shoujo, the anime that most surprised and won me over this season. <br />
<br />
This show is not just the everyday life of girls craving stardom at a theater arts school. It&#039;s about dreams, overcomings, disappointments, traumas, and hopes. <br />
<br />
The anime shows a very realistic vision, with several foundations, and cruel life, and often brutal, that a young woman can have when searching for fame and success. <br />
<br />
Yes, brutal. Kageki addresses topics such as sexual abuse and persecutors, eating disorders, resentments left by hurt and hatred, problems in a destabilized family nucleus, family abandonment, ideals imposed on him by others... <br />
<br />
They are girls fighting for a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418787">
        desire. Not an idealistic dream, or a desire for megalomaniac greatness, but a passion. They are girls who, when going through all kinds of traumatic situations, overcome them by their own strength to pursue the passion of their lives. <br />
<br />
Kageki Shoujo is full of charismatic and exuberant characters, both in sympathy and personality, as well as in willpower. Having dreams is quite common, but who, in their right mind, would shout it to the four corners of an extremely competitive and toxic environment, where every attitude can be subject to reprisals? It sounds stupid but it&#039;s not if you&#039;re Watanabe Sarasa. The blonde-haired girl&#039;s sincerity and willpower captivate every minute on stage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Escaping from the Kabuki environment, Sarasa finds her place at Kouka College, especially because she meets Narata Ai, the girl who would become her best friend. <br />
<br />
There, without a doubt, he is among the characters who achieved the most personal growth throughout history. From Ex Idol, raised in a hostile and neglected family environment, being a victim of attempted sexual abuse as a child, the girl who has androphobia becomes a young girl with no prospects for the future, despite having fame and success. <br />
<br />
Naracchi, as she is called, little by little, manages to change when she realizes her real state. Cultivating excellent relationships of friendship and companionship, Ai finds his new goal in Sarasa. To be a friend capable of protecting and possessing enough strength to support your precious mate&#039;s dreams.<br />
<br />
<br />
The anime cast is fantastic. Yamada Ayako, the shy and demure girl, owner of many passions during her adolescence but who doesn&#039;t have the main one: her own. Her lack of confidence and self-respect make her an easy target for other girls in the class who are driven by envy, thus culminating in her strong nutritional bulimia. Ayako begins to change when she meets Sugimoto Sawa, a strong and determined girl, willing to fight for everything she wants, even if it means fighting against talent or destiny. <br />
<br />
The friendship cultivated between the two is just as important as that of the main pair. Ayako realizes, through Sawa, that the main person to fall in love with is ourselves.<br />
Subtlety and strength. Shyness and boldness. The balance between them is enviable.<br />
<br />
<br />
While with sisters Sawado, Chika and Chiaki, the story is different. Owners of an unparalleled tune, typical of twins, but distant in their hearts. The pair teach us how dangerous it is to cultivate emotions that are harmful to the heart, such as envy, jealousy, hurt and resentment.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is worth highlighting the Kouka School and the importance of the Educational Center when the family environment does not meet the needs of growth. Its excellent teachers, both in artistic skills but, above all, in their love for teaching (see the desire to accompany the growth of their students) is, at so many times, the foundation for the maturation of the girls in the Hundredth Class.<br />
<br />
<br />
How many don&#039;t give up at the first sign of difficulties? Kageki Shoujo portrays the opposite of this.<br />
Girls who won&#039;t give up, whatever the cost.

    It’s time for a change of pace, there are definitely countless series involving sparkly idol girls who overcome every challenge easily through the power of friendship and put on expert level performances with a little bit of practice, but there aren’t enough series that are focused on how difficult it is to actually excel at performance arts. Sometimes it’s simply more entertaining to watch a brutally realistic depiction of a highly competitive industry, in this case live opera performances. Kageki Shoujo is a down to earth show about teenage girls struggling to break into a competitive industry and it is also a fairly well executed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418278">
        character drama series. This review will predominantly cover how Kageki Shoujo effectively delivered an intense story of a group of girls who struggle, fight, and suffer to achieve their dreams, the review will also cover various elements such as art and sound design and expand on what Kageki Shoujo did well at and what it lacked.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Kageki Shoujo covers the academy to theater pipeline and paints a clear picture of the struggles involved in becoming a top performer, from a competitive entrance process to constant pressure to be perfect, the series never lets the cast take a breather on their journey to becoming top stars. Before we go any further, it is important to note that this show does touch on various topics that some viewers may not enjoy or find difficult to watch including sexual abuse, body image issues, stalking and bullying. These problems are very common in the entertainment industry and the show handles the prior mentioned topics in a tasteful and realistic way that doesn’t exploit the characters for an edge factor. Each one of the issues are generally well-grounded and touched on in an intelligent manner, maybe except for one girl getting over her eating disorder a little too easily, but overall, the issues are covered competently. Due to how well Kageki Shoujo handled these issues, they are a lot more tolerable to watch, however if these topics are very likely to bother you then it’s recommended that you don’t watch the anime.<br />
<br />
Now that we got that out of the way, expanding on the story and cast, Kageki Shoujo is predominantly centered on 2 girls enrolled in an opera academy, although the rest of the cast is fleshed out it is clear that these 2 girls take precedence over everyone else. The first girl, Narata Ai, is not initially interested in Opera at all, she gets into the school due to her good looks and overwhelming performance talent that was cultivated during her idol career. Narata however only joined the academy because the student body happened to be all female and she suffers from a severe phobia of all things related to men. This phobia is explained later on to have stemmed from early childhood sexual abuse and is a major reason on why Ai has a very reclusive personality, it also causes or is related to a good portion of the conflicts between her and the other main character Sarasa. While Ai initially has no interest in opera, Sarasa from the start has every interest in becoming a top star and has gone far out of her way to get into the academy, her background story is quite well fleshed out as well and its worth seeing how their different perspectives and upbringing leads them to interact initially. <br />
<br />
Although the main 2 girls don’t get along at first, they eventually play off each other and the character dynamics between them as they grow closer are quite interesting to watch, we get to see intense background stories along with them standing up for each other and actively working to bring out the best in each other. Next to the main cast are the other girls who are a mixture of competitive, insecure, driven and incredibly jealous teens who will have conflicts with our 2 main girls, try to undermine them, be inspired by them, or grow alongside them and some of the side characters even get amazing individual episodes dedicated to them. The character drama is really good, the dialogue is funny, and the conflicts feel both real and captivating as every girl from their perspective is quite sure about their feelings and its quite easy to see things from each girl’s perspective, none of them are necessarily in the wrong, they just have competing interests. Outside of the awful stepdad we see in one episode, it’s hard to say that Kageki Shoujo has villains, there are antagonists, but they tend to be of a competitive nature such as rivals or upperclassmen who try to undermine the new girls, these antagonists are written very well and although you may end up hating them, it’s very easy to see understand why they do what they do.<br />
<br />
Overall, the cast is really interesting, and the story has a great mixture of comedy, tragedy and interesting drama, there is never a wasted moment and every part of the show either explores the girls or involves the girls moving forward towards their goals of being successful opera stars. It’s fair to give this part of the show an 8/10 as it achieves everything expected out of a character drama-oriented series and gives the audience a great look into the cutthroat world of performance arts.<br />
<br />
There are some technical elements that should be discussed as well, the character designs are fairly interesting, they look very pretty and unique compared to how most anime girls are drawn. Although all the girls do technically fall into a specific type of pretty girl like idol characters do, they do have more masculine looking girls as well as tall girls. This is because all female opera requires that the actresses cover the male and female positions, which leads to a variety of body types of appearances. <br />
<br />
Character designs aside the rest of the art isn’t particularly impressive, it’s a standard high school setting type of art style and background design that you probably have seen in countless seasonal anime, nothing about it is super impressive except the visuals in the ending song which were done very well. The animation for the show as well is simply alright at best, it fulfills its purpose but don’t expect any mind-blowing scenes, nothing is bad in the sense of delivering slide shows but it’s not some sort of excellently choreographed masterpiece with incredibly fluid performances. There was however a decent portrayal of what an eating disorder looks like, and it was a nice touch that Ai grew her hair back slowly through the show which is the opposite of how girls in anime usually move past trauma but applies perfectly in this series, carefully applied details like this added a nice touch to the show.<br />
<br />
This review will not go very in depth into the sound design but will note the highlight points. The ending theme and visuals were very good while the opening was fairly solid but outside of that the music in this show is forgettable and if I were it to rate it the music is a solid 8 out of 10 at best. Although the instrumental soundtrack is great and adds a lot to the competitive atmosphere, it just isn’t exceptional or remarkable enough that it would be worth listening to on its own. However, the ending theme really is something special, its recommended to check it out, every version has its own visuals for the girls that are front and center for that episode, and they all look great.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is recommended if you want to watch an excellent character drama, one where difficult social problems are touched on in an effective way and the conflicts are intense and impactful. It also helps if you like predominantly female casts and enjoy learning about an industry you may not be familiar with. Drama alone would be a 9, however the other aspects of the story are not really that deep and nothing about the soundtrack or art style appeal strongly overall, so the show is at best an 8, however it is still enjoyable enough that it would be recommended to anyone who enjoys drama related series.

    To lift off a page of ANN&#039;s article on the history of the Takarazuka Revue (you should defintely read that fantastic article BTW):<br />
Shall I tell a modern tale of girls and a stage? Curtains unraveled to their far reaches, a grand staircase positioned in the back, the spotlight basks on two figures: a sweeping-dress maiden played by a woman, and an epaulettes-coat hero played by another woman. Both are from the Takarazuka Revue.<br />
<br />
The Takarazuka Revue is such a historical and important milestone in the history of Japan&#039;s theatre scene, one that caters only to the women, and is the female version of the Kabuki, where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418277">
        both theatres cater to only the sole preferred sex (any criss-crossing are banned). Over time, we&#039;ve seen influences that hold the Takarazuka Revue in high regard, from the likes of Riyoko Ikeda&#039;s The Rose of Versailles and Osamu Tezuka&#039;s Princess Knight, to anime series like Kunihiko Ikuhara&#039;s Revolutionary Girl Utena, the recent Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight by the production staff together with Ikuhara&#039;s protégé student director Tomohiro Furukawa (which is STILL my gold standard for modern-day masterpiece representation of the Revue). And now, we&#039;re here with mangaka Kumiko Saiki&#039;s Kageki Shoujo!!, which dives deeper into the roots of the Takarazuka Revue and expresses how women are birthed into a lifetime acting career that will tremendously shape the rest of their lives. And for real, Kageki Shoujo!! brings me back to Revue Starlight levels, only more grounded for a history lesson of sorts with immense fascination.<br />
<br />
The TL;DR about Kageki Shoujo!!, is that it&#039;s the story of the &quot;graduated&quot; J-pop idol Ai Narata and Kabuki reject student Sarasa Watanabe becoming great friends and pursuing dreams in a not-Takarazuka (Kouka) School of Musical and Theatrical Arts. The anime focuses on the routines and challenges of Takarazuka trainees as they learn to develop the necessary skills and expected posture of the Takarasienne-esque roles they are aiming for, with Sarasa set on becoming an otokoyaku and Ai, a musumeyaku. In addition, Ai and Sarasa also have to juggle their school lives with their traumatic past ones, resurfaced memories of abuse by men in Ai&#039;s case and dismissal by systems that privilege them in Sarasa&#039;s. The anime keeps Nobuko Yoshiya&#039;s Class S elements to an explicitly platonic level, as Sarasa is revealed to have a boyfriend outside of the school and classmate Kaoru Hoshino is shown to have harbored positive romantic feelings for a boy from her days before joining it. In hindsight, the real truth about Kageki Shoujo!! is that it&#039;s a full-on character development case study that it&#039;s not so much on just these girls&#039; ambition to be part of the Kouka Revue (which clearly pays omage to the Takarazuka Revue), but how they got there in the first place. Each and every one of the girls in the prestigious Kouka School, made even special by the fact that they form the Centennial 100th Class, has their own story to tell, whether good or bad, fortunate or tragic, it&#039;s clearly a nuance as to how significant events in their lives had led them to this grand stage.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s take the main female leads Sarasa Watanabe and Ai Narata&#039;s situations for example. Kicking things off with the monotonous girl that started the #MeToo movement: Ai Narata. Having been a successful idol under the JPX48 banner, but with her androphobia (fear of men) causing her to be expelled from the scene in an abrupt turn, she turns to the Kouka School to escape from the reality and trauma that has wrecked her life upside down. With a bit of help rendered from both sexes (surprise twist) and much convincing, Ai calms down, lets loose of her androphobicness, and acknowledges that whatever the case may be harbouring to her hatred for men, she tries to understand from their perspective. That all starts from the very first friend that made an impression on her, the &quot;Lady Oscar&quot; wannabe, the blonde-puffy-haired tall girl Sarasa Watanabe. If you thought that Ai&#039;s backstory isn&#039;t traumatic enough, then Sarasa&#039;s will certainly do. Having an interest in the men&#039;s version of the Takarazuka (Kabuki) since young, and made by the fact that she was adopted into a Kabuki family because of her dad (Kozaburou) who got married to a daughter from that family who comes from a long established line of Kabuki actors, Sarasa develops an exhibitant talent for Kabuki, and even once performed at one of the most celebrated Kabuki shows (Sukeroku) under disguise. What went all wrong is that her childhood friend-turned-boyfriend Akiya, who was born with the distinguished family&#039;s name from birth, is naturally poised to become the family&#039;s successor. But since Sarasa&#039;s talent proved too much to be a threat on Akiya&#039;s position, his family exiled her to no appeal, essentially banning her from taking part in Kabuki and angering her only family member (her grandfather) so much as to cut their relations off. What keeps her relationship intact with Akiya is that they can only meet externally outside the family&#039;s doors in total secrecy, while still maintaining contact with each other.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg, and with many girls (and many more) like:<br />
- The similarly tall Sawa Sugimoto who gave up her chance to be a prima ballerina/ballet dancer;<br />
- The blonde Kaoru Hoshino whom not withstanding the issues to use an umbrella to cover her from the sun, therefore prohibiting getting a tan skin, but like Akiya&#039;s with the whole familial pressure since her family members also are once prestigious Kouka actresses, coupled together with relationship issues like Sarasa&#039;s but only from a distance;<br />
- The timid and clumsy Ayako Yamada who has to juggle her weight issues through an eating disorder that forces her to be in line with the many Kouka girls of high standards, and yet another relationship issue like Sarasa&#039;s that went one-sided;<br />
- The Sawada twins of Chika and Chiaki whom like Sarasa, had an inspiration from a Kouka performance, so much so that they went to audition for it that saw a pass and a failure on their admission test that caused the breaking point of their relationship. Both had wanted to be admitted together, but reality strikes the other way;<br />
<br />
You can get the sense of admonishment of how hard it is just to be admitted in the Kouka School of Musical and Theatrical Arts, and that&#039;s not to say of its exquisitely harsh, high standards of which all girls must conduct themselves in the highest of orders. It&#039;s reality for these girls and many others IRL which is a perfect representation of the Takarazuka Revue, a standard of which must be kept pure, pristine and being proud of the tradition they hail from being coveted with a brand name.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been long since Pine Jam ever produced a show, but as for purely drama shows, I&#039;d argue that Kageki Shoujo!! is the most aesthetically pleasing show that the small studio has ever done from its humble beginnings since 2016 (or more preferably the breakout show that put the studio on the animation map, 2017&#039;s Gamers!). Against the backdrop of its past produced shows (Gamers!, Just Because! and Glepnir), IMO this was a relative departure to be chosen to produce a work that specializes in such a niche category as acting, but man did Pine Jam managed to pull it off so nicely. The vibrant art style and visuals are just as good as the IRL theatre acting stage themselves, bringing out the colours with some nice execution. Animation is just there I feel, but the choreography pretty much made all the difference when it comes to the expression of detail.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s an acting show without one of the most central aspects of it, the music? It&#039;s of a no-brainer to say that the music must complement the acting genre, and in this case, this is as close to Revue Starlight for me, if not a tad down under, but still really good. saji&#039;s OP is a nicely well-endowed song that speaks true to its tones, while the various lead EDs by the characters do juxtapose according to the episodic stories featured that showcases their Romeo and Juliet-esque feelings with the Rose of Versailles inspiration all strewn over.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, all of this is reason enough for me to say that this is what makes Kageki Shoujo!! such a compelling show that may not have the ambitious grandeur and pizzazz of Revue Starlight, but manages to shine in its own light of realistic abundance. Series like this aren&#039;t the usual fashion of &quot;a dime a dozen&quot;, but it&#039;s rare to see stories like this get featured in anime, which makes the whole preposition act a lot more desirable in the face of expectations vs. reality. Trust me, if you came from Revue Starlight and it left you wanting more or something else to dig on, Kageki Shoujo!! will give you that assurance. It&#039;s delicacy of the utmost balance.

    ※ Contains light spoilers, as well as mentions of heavy topics such as sexual assault and eating disorders.<br />
※ I have not read the manga, so this review covers only the anime.<br />
<br />
Being a young girl is tempestuous and complicated. This is something that Kageki Shoujo!! (or Opera Girl!!) understands fairly well; almost as well, though, as it only barely understands entertainment value and emotional payoffs.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, Kageki Shoujo is not a bad anime. I honestly understand why most of the scores are on the higher side. Seeing a show that treats the traumatic issues young girls go through in a sensible and reasonable manner

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418322">
        instead of applied for shock value, especially after the Wonder Egg Priority fiasco, already makes this a holy grail. They tackle things like eating disorders, bullying, child sexual abuse, the unreasonable demands of show business and family complications with a reasonable amount of poise. The girls in this show aren&#039;t treated as simply vessels for suffering and trauma - they are treated as people who are trying to navigate life and heal the wounds inevitably inflicted onto them by the world and the societal pressure they are under. Each of them have their own personal struggles that shape the way they experience the world, affecting also how they deal with the demands at Kouka. Not to mention the setting involving girls in training to become Kouka (modeled after Takarazuka) actresses is pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s a good amount of positives in the show, yes? But now allow me to get into the negatives.<br />
<br />
The most glaringly obvious problem with Kageki Shoujo to me is that, in its genuine efforts to do well with difficult subjects, it forgets about something very important: making their characters not be absolute snooze-fests. And that is what they are: those girls were written with the utmost care put into the portrayal of their trauma and backstories, but not an ounce of this same care was spared for making them charismatic, lively, interesting people. Their personalities are just a timid blow into each of their school girl selves; one of them is strict. Another is stoic. Another is shy. Another is cheerful. And little is done to make them memorable or fun to watch - we only get the amount necessary to make sense within their backstories and to make them barely distinguishable from each other. I wouldn&#039;t even say there is effort put into making their personalities realistic either, considering that some of them are bordering on being anime trope caricatures. Even Sarasa, the biggest stand-out of the group, gets boring to watch after a while when the &quot;I&#039;m super tall but also super merry&quot; gimmick wears off. It&#039;s very hard to see the 1st years as a natural group for a good while; you can only really start to believe in their alleged friendsip towards the end of the show, and even so it&#039;s still nothing that will make you truly feel like you&#039;re watching a good group dynamic. Watching those girls was mostly dull when the anime wasn&#039;t talking about their heavy and darkest issues. Caring for and connecting with those girls was hard; sure I could empathize with them and their trauma, but I was left cold most of the time, unable to give an emotional response and feel anything other than a simple &quot;she&#039;s nice, I guess&quot; towards them. This actually made all of the well written bits about the societal hardships that they face go almost completely down the drain, because it doesn&#039;t matter how respectful you are with them if you make your subjects about as interesting as unseasoned pasta. Not to mention that their character development felt contrived as a result - the biggest example of this being Narata Ai, who downgrades from being an interesting exploration of how heavy trauma can make you aloof and close-hearted to being the centerpiece of mediocre kuudere moe moments for the rest of the show.<br />
<br />
Another point of contrivance was how the show seemed to suffer from a double identity. I heard that the manga itself was actually split in two parts, and the anime adapts both - the first part up to episode 5, and from episode 6 onwards the second one. I don&#039;t think this was a good decision, because it&#039;s honestly glaring and plain as day that the first and second half have different feelings to them. The first few episodes&#039; main focus were on the aforementioned heavy subjects and character backstories. The second half focuses on the actual theatre aspect of it, showcasing various Kouka personalities and traditions, and finally having the girls engage in some proper acting. And I have to say, the second half is definitely better - not by a huge margin, mind you, but it felt more like the anime I wanted to watch, since for an excruciatingly long while the Kouka setting felt more like adornment than something relevant and woven into the fabric of the series. Kageki Shoujo does still lack a lot of things I&#039;d expect to see in an anime of the sort: theatrics, bright colors, big personalities, nuanced conflict, explorations of gender, even a more interesting visual identity (the muted colors and safe directing did it no favors). But that&#039;s not to say the show was entirely unenjoyable, with moments such as the Romeo and Juliet audition in the final episodes being decently entertaining. I feel as though it was cut too short. If I got to spend a longer time with the energy it was building in the second half, I could see myself liking it more, and perhaps even becoming attached to some of the characters.<br />
<br />
And speaking of the first half of the show, that&#039;s where lies another huge issue I had with it. I&#039;ve praised Kageki Shoujo for doing the bare minimum and giving us serious and sensible treatment to topics pertaining the suffering young girls go through in society... however, I don&#039;t know if I can say the same about nuance. To be more specific, those subjects are dealt with with respect - but not with nuance.<br />
<br />
To be fair you can blame some of this on the fact that the first and second half were adapted from technically &quot;separate&quot; manga, and I won&#039;t say it&#039;s so bad that it&#039;s offensive, but there is a certain shallow quality, a stillness to the way Kageki Shoujo seems to resolve its character arcs, that left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Every single time it feels like they&#039;re about to say something of great value, they pull back and decide to go with something safer instead. Ai&#039;s arc begins with a smoky bang, viscerally examining her PTSD and fear of men caused by abuse infused with a critique towards japanese idol culture... only to fall flat on its behind when the culmination of the conflict ends up being all about &quot;her stalker/fan wasn&#039;t actually a bad person!&quot; Shouldn&#039;t her arc&#039;s resolution have been about her own self? I&#039;d like to have seen Ai heal and grow from her relationships with her newfound friends at Kouka, not from a &quot;not all men are bad&quot; moment - especially when we and Ai already know that via her relationship with Taichi. In the end, Ai&#039;s fan&#039;s good intentions don&#039;t matter, not because he&#039;s a bad person, but because this is derailing the direction Ai&#039;s arc was taking. The same can be said for Yamada&#039;s clash with an eating disorder. She started purging after hearing from a teacher that she&#039;s fat, but not only does that teacher receive no consequences for her reckless statement, she doubles down on it. And the resolution of Yamada spiraling into self-destructive behavior is just... another teacher telling her not to give up, and then she is magically recovered and this is never touched upon again. So her self-esteem issues were fixed just from that? I&#039;m supposed to believe that the teacher who showed no remorse for saying &quot;fatties have no place at Kouka&quot; won&#039;t do it again - and, if she does, that Yamada will be ok upon hearing it? It makes no sense to me. The show is empathetic towards the issues these girls face, but it also seems coldly disinterested in challenging the systems that are the root cause of them. The takeaway from these arcs seems to be &quot;Just work hard, do your best and adapt and then it will be ok! Sure, the rules are unfair, but we can meet them halfway!&quot; which is a little uncomfortable to say the least when applied to the harrowing realities these characters are going through. The way that those issues are nearly nonexistent in the second half of the show compared to the first is truly baffling, and I honestly wish they weren&#039;t included at all if it was never the author&#039;s intention to give them continuity. Those aren&#039;t things that go away and no longer need to be talked about after they happen. You can&#039;t make use of such serious subjects to make small and/or episodic arcs with an immediate resolution without making it look like you&#039;re taking them lightly - this isn&#039;t Pretty Cure, bulimia is not a monster of the week. In the end, was Kageki Shoujo even actually trying to say something about those subjects, or was it trying to be a more lighthearted slice of life drama with mini arcs that don&#039;t tie into each other? Pick one. I think you can&#039;t do both at once.<br />
<br />
Like I said, Kageki Shoujo really doesn&#039;t do a lot besides but the bare minimum. When it comes to its complicated subjects, it lacks the explosive emotional catharsis of the likes of Madoka Magica, it lacks the biting and nuanced critique to harmful systems of Revolutionary Girl Utena. When it comes to its entertainment from the dramatic theatre setting and slice of life moments, it lacks the likeable personalities of Revue Starlight, it lacks the emotional punch of Love Live. Hell, even the known-to-be-awful Wonder Egg Priority had a little more guts than this does. Kageki Shoujo just doesn&#039;t bother to work with what it has. And I&#039;m a little sick of dubbing bare minimum as acceptable. I&#039;m yawning.<br />
<br />
Call me back when those girls are ready for a revolution.

    I pretty much knew nothing about this series until someone posted a review of the first part of the manga on Anime News Network, and that review pretty much made me want to buy it. I mean, hello? In this recent sea of bland isekai, bad ecchi, or generic media, when was the last time we had a genuine shoujo manga that actually had an intriguing story that harkened back to a lot of classics like Rose of Versailles and Glass Mask? Yeah, the whole idea of girls going to a specialized performing arts school has been done to death in other places, but my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421946">
        philosophy is that if you actually put effort into what you create and manage to make something compelling, complete with good execution and characters we can care about, then there&#039;s nothing wrong with reusing a well-worn premise. I actually bought the manga for Kageki Shojo as soon as I read that review, along with what little of it has been released here in the US so far, and liked it a lot, so you can bet as soon as the anime was announced, I was going to watch it without hesitation. So I&#039;m glad to say that this series did meet my expectations, even when it covered parts of the manga that haven&#039;t come out in the US as of this writing.<br />
<br />
The story takes place at a famous performing arts academy called the Kouka School of Musical and Theatrical Arts. It&#039;s basically a school version of the Takarazuka Revue and has been teaching girls since the Taisho era. Two very different girls, Ai Narata and Sarasa Watanabe, find themselves becoming classmates upon being accepted into the famous school, but they couldn&#039;t be more different. Ai, a stoic, emotionless girl, was kicked out of her old idol group after an incident with a fan, but this doesn&#039;t bother her, as she came to Kouka so she could live a life without being pursued by men. On the other hand, Sarasa is a tall, loud, chipper, energetic girl who loves anime and manga, and her reason for coming to Kouka is that she wants to star as Oscar in a production of The Rose of Versailles, having loved it since she was a kid. They, along with several other students they come to know, will have to learn to cooperate with one another if they have any hope of surviving Kouka&#039;s notoriously rigorous training, along with all the pressures and hardships that come from being in such a competitive setting.<br />
<br />
One thing you&#039;ll notice about Kageki Shojo right off the bat is that it references and takes a lot of cues from both old school anime such as Rose of Versailles, and the famous Takarazuka Revue. For those not in the know, Takarazuka is basically an all-female acting troupe that is famous for putting on lavish, Broadway-style musicals that adapt everything from Western novels, shoujo manga, films, folktales, and on rare occasions, video games (Can you believe they did a series of musicals for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney of all things?). Rose of Versailles in particular is important because the Revue has performed multiple shows for it, and in-universe, it&#039;s the main inspiration for one of the lead characters&#039; motivations for going to Kouka. That being said, both the anime and manga expect its readers/viewers to have some degree of knowledge of both. While it&#039;s not outright required, a lot of the references will fly over the heads of people who know absolutely nothing about Rose of Versailles or Takarazuka, especially the latter and how it operates. Whether you&#039;re knowledgeable about Takarazuka or not, it&#039;s made very clear that the people who worked on both the anime and manga for Kageki Shojo have a deep love and reverence for the performing arts. I mean, somebody made an entire Twitter thread dedicated to showing off all the references and setpieces that Kageki Shojo uses, from various landmarks all the way down to replicating real actors&#039; poses. So I can give the anime props for actually caring about its source material and respecting the intricacies behind the performing arts, both showing off how great it is while refusing to gloss over some of the more dangerous parts of it, such as the overly competitive atmosphere and even some toxic attitudes. A series that really goes out of its way to pay close attention to its setting and the framework behind it deserves major props in my book.<br />
<br />
The reverence for Takarazuka also shows in the animation, from replicating setpieces, actors, and performances down to the poses, like I mentioned earlier. Of course, Pine Jam did more than just simply copy the most well known parts of Takarazuka here. The animation is smooth, and the characters have simple designs that manage to toe the lie between being cartoony and realistic, even if some characters&#039; hair colors don&#039;t exactly mesh well with the more realistic setting. Seriously, who&#039;s idea was it to have Sarasa&#039;s blonde hair have light green tips?! Plus, the backgrounds are nicely detailed, the performance sequences are well done, making good use of lighting and motion, and even some of the cartoony parts, like exaggerated facial expressions, aren&#039;t so pervasive that they ruin the show&#039;s overall tone. The soundtrack is okay, though I didn&#039;t find it to be too memorable except for the more orchestrated parts, like the ending theme song. I heard one person say that the show places inappropriate music for some scenes, making them feel dissonant with its intended atmosphere, such as playing soothing harp music while an adult man is leering at a 10-year-old girl, but personally, I disagree, though I think part of it is because the voice acting is louder than the music at times, so maybe I missed it. But I really don&#039;t think the soundtrack is as jarringly dissonant as that user says, though I have heard examples that are way worse about this, such as Nurse Angel Ririka SOS and Grimm&#039;s Fairy Tale Classics, especially for the Japanese version of the latter.<br />
<br />
A show like this lives or dies on its characters, and in that aspect, I think Kageki Shojo succeeds. Since this series only has 13 episodes, it doesn&#039;t have time to develop all of them, but it does keep the focus centered on a few important ones, mainly the ones depicted on the main key art. All of them receive time in the spotlight, showing what their strengths and weaknesses are, and why they chose to come to this particular school. Even the characters who might come across as really cliche and annoying, like Sarasa, are given more depth to them later on, and Kaoru&#039;s episode is easily the best one. One thing people will notice about Kageki Shojo is that it&#039;s not afraid to tackle serious, sensitive subject matter such as eating disorders, stalking, and child sexual abuse. Anime is no stranger to tough topics, but many of them do struggle with depicting them tastefully and not in a voyeuristic manner. Kageki Shojo manages to treat them well enough that it doesn&#039;t border on voyeuristic or purely for shock value, but it does tend to tie up the subplots involving them a little too neatly, with one example being the eating disorder subplot with one of the side characters. An eating disorder doesn&#039;t simply go away in a week just because someone encouraged her to keep going, though to be fair, the manga had the exact same problem, and apparently that was mainly because the authoress for the manga found out too late that the story was being moved to a different magazine and felt she needed to resolve it so as to not leave loose threads hanging. But that&#039;s a story for another review. Really, that&#039;s the only problem I had with Kageki Shojo is that it&#039;s too short and that it ties up certain subplots too neatly, but those aren&#039;t even exactly a mark against its overall quality.<br />
<br />
There is one character I want to talk about, and that&#039;s Sarasa, and there&#039;s something I&#039;ve noticed among anime when it comes to characters like her, particularly kids anime. I&#039;m in the process of watching another anime called Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure, and the main character of that show, Manatsu, pretty much has the same personality as Sarasa: Cheerful, enthusiastic, determined, and nice to everyone, even when people are being really mean to her. Here&#039;s the thing: It seems like most people who work on anime like this believe that if you have a character act brightly enough all the time, the audience will see them as cheerful characters, but rather than simply portray someone who&#039;s cheerful, they make the mistake of making them so over-the-top cheerful that it becomes their sole character trait. They don&#039;t show them as having any other emotions than being overly happy and zany all the time. My problem with Manatsu is that, after 30-something episodes, she hasn&#039;t shown any other emotions than being over-the-top happy and zany, constantly shouting &quot;Tropica-shine!&quot; every two seconds, and the few times she acts anything but happy is played for laughs. She&#039;s not allowed to be vulnerable or even act like a normal human being, which annoys the shit out of me. Sarasa, on the other hand, is an example of this type of character done right, especially in her focus episodes. Yes, she&#039;s shown as being cheerful and annoying at times, but the creators actually allow her to show emotions other than mindless happiness. They allow her to be angry, sad, jealous, insecure, the whole gamut of emotions, which actually make her into a more well-rounded person. She has moments where she&#039;s vulnerable and insecure, and she has to feel other emotions when playing characters in a play, because if you don&#039;t put yourself in that character&#039;s shoes or just copy someone else&#039;s take on it, you&#039;re nothing. It&#039;s the same thing with the two Cinderellas from both Disney movies, the 1950 one and the 2015 live-action remake. The former, while not the most proactive character, feels more like a human being and actually gives a shit about the situation she&#039;s in, whereas the 2015 movie tried way too hard to make her smart and independent while accidentally making her more passive and like an overly happy zombie who doesn&#039;t even try to do anything about her situation. What makes or breaks a character is how they deal with their flaws, because rather than simply make a character one thing and nothing else, they need to be interesting first. Tl;dr, Sarasa from Kageki Shojo is a better genki girl than Manatsu from Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure because Sarasa is allowed to be flawed and act like a human being.<br />
<br />
Alright, I better get off this soapbox. If you&#039;re looking for a show that actually cares about its material, definitely check out Kageki Shojo if you can. It&#039;s an underrated gem that absolutely deserves more love than it gets.

    Wow, what a surprise this was! Kageki Shoujo is probably my dark horse of Summer 2021. Even though this isn’t a perfect anime for me, it drew me in and I couldn’t look away. It did exactly what musical theatre is supposed to do - grab your attention, keep it, and then dazzle you with shimmering lights and emotions. This is an anime full of heart and love for acting, and it is delivered through some of the best character writing of the year.<br />
<br />
Kageki Shoujo is more of a school slice-of-life than anything else, but it’s one of the most realistic slice-of-lifes I’ve seen. All

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419387">
        the characters share the goal to be top actors in the Kouka Troupe, but they each struggle with trying to reach it. As they struggle, we learn about their motivations and witness the traumas that haunt them, leading to revelations that get both deep and even dark. Sometimes I was reminded of Wonder Egg Priority, but Kageki Shoujo is different - its smart writing assures that the characters’ hardships and how they try to overcome them actually mean something in the end. Since this is a slice-of-life series, I wasn’t too worried if episodes jumped around from topic to topic, but the ending was somewhat disappointing for me. I think the current ending is a good stopping point if you’re faithfully adapting the source material and you only have 13 episodes, but it still felt like a “read the manga” ending.<br />
<br />
So yes, the character writing is fantastic, even with its relatively large cast of 7 characters. While Sarasa and Ai are touted as the main duo, all the characters get time for the audience to get acquainted and understand who they are. All the girls show signs of growth, and by the time the final episodes roll around, you might even find yourself silently cheering them on as they mature. Some of the character arcs are tragically realistic and mirror a lot of the ugly that I’ve seen in the theater and dance world, so you may need to be mentally prepared if necessary, but I believe these heavy topics were handled gracefully. Perhaps it was due to Kageki Shoujo’s relatively short length, but it felt like the character writing was trying to cover a lot of ground in so little time because characters were getting developed until the bitter end of the series. If the series had 12 more episodes, or if I knew a second season was coming, I probably wouldn’t be too concerned about it.<br />
<br />
While the aforementioned elements are pretty solid, the animation isn’t anything to write home about. There are some episodes that seem to be 50% limited animation and 50% still frames. However, the art and design save it as it evokes nostalgia for the shoujo aesthetics of the 90’s and early 2000’s. There’s something so gentle, yet strong, about how the characters and backgrounds are drawn. Because of this, even when the actual animation is unimpressive, the show is still beautiful to look at. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is only fine. There are one or two songs that drag me in, but I don’t really pay attention to it. I’m not too crazy about the song used for the OP either, but I’m a sucker for the ED and how the singers and the visuals change for each character. But overall, I don’t have much more to say about it.<br />
<br />
I had a fantastic time watching Kageki Shoujo, and I give it a solid 8/10. Even with my concerns about some of the anime’s elements, I may have a go at the manga to see if that alleviates them, and that’s big for me to say because I rarely have the urge to go pick up the source material after an anime concludes. But anyway, I always appreciate good arts-oriented anime, and I’m especially appreciative of this as it covers the good and the bad of theatre with care and love. It’s such an injustice that so few people have watched or completed this show so far, so I really encourage everyone to give Kageki Shoujo a chance.<br />

    Are men, truly creeps? <br />
Are men truly bad guys?<br />
<br />
I do apologize for starting this review like this, and I won&#039;t dive too much onto the topic, Among other things that this anime covers, as it&#039;s pretty heavy, but it&#039;s done in serious tone, as it&#039;s not the place for sure. But it is one of the main themes of this entire show. Being that it is centered around our main in Narata, Ai, whom trough a series of unfortunate happenings, that can be very heavy subject wise. Have lead her to dislike men in general. Which later has impacted her life a ton. As she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409725">
        and others go through the Red Flower Opera Music, which is run by said Red Flower Opera Company. which upholds the idea of &#039; attracting people&#039;s hearts across generations on a beautiful and gorgeous stage&#039; As we watch our characters, try to break certain boundaries around the star attraction of it all.<br />
<br />
But to go further into the story, like I said, it does in it&#039;s first few episodes, paint the idea if most men are just creeps. Which can be weird at first, very weird, but with the other points that the show brings, it becomes less impactfull as the show goes on. With the show mainly focusing on growth, achieving your dreams and goals, and overcoming barriers along the way. It&#039;s very sweet at times too, with how the characters interact and defend one another. It&#039;s the charm. Sometimes it can be a good experience, but at times, there is some uneasy moments, that possibly could turn away some if it&#039;s not for them. Or find it unsettling in their own right.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve mentioned about Ai and her situation, but she isn&#039;t the only main girl! We also have the free positive bundle of tall that is Watanabe, who is just sweet and I wish for the best. She doesn&#039;t let her tallness get her down, or stop her from chasing what she wants. Which is just great. My only gripe with the characters is that, so far, only three-four seem really memorable. As in once this show has finished, and you think about it, you&#039;re only going to recall a few then more.<br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
The art seems neat and clean, colourful, and can really represent a scene in certain areas. The animation is also good, thoug I do have to point out at how tall Watanabe can look in certain shots compared to others. Some shots she looks freakishly taller than the other girls, and in other times, she seems not too tall. It&#039;s not bad, it&#039;s just amusing to notice haha. While the sound of course, for a show like this, you&#039;d expect it to be good, and it is here. <br />
<br />
Kageki Shoujo dances around a fair number of topics, and may seem very weird at first, but keep going for it. It&#039;ll be worth the watch despite that. But if it&#039;s not for you, that&#039;s perfectly understandable. It really depends your taste, and ow you feel about the subject matter if you want to watch this sow.

    Looking forward for a possible 2nd season of Kageki Shoujo!! The world of Kouka was completely new for me, so it was refreshing to see a school where things are a little bit different than the usual schools in anime. I had my doubts at first, but, after the story developed, I truly became interested in knowing more about the characters (even Hijiri, who&#039;s purposefully a hateful character). I&#039;ve watched a lot of animes, but can&#039;t really remember on the spot of ones that dealt with sensible topics in the way Kageki Shoujo!! did... it felt like a punch on the stomach sometimes.<br />

And, of course,

        so many boyish, handsome girls, both with long and short hair. A big treat indeed!

    Did you love &#039;Rose of Versailles&#039; and &#039;Glass Mask&#039;? If you don&#039;t know any of them I&#039;d recommend watching those (Glass Mask has a remake, by the way) and if you love the classics as much as I did, you&#039;ll totally love this series. This has been one of my favorite anime of the year.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s difficult to tag what genre is this but something is certain: it&#039;s a mixture of shoujo and josei (some students are from high school and others are already 19-year-olds) and a mixture of shoujo ai and sorority. Everyone is complex and has their own situation and trauma. It has that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420055">
        old vibe about 80s and 90s but drawn with a modern animation and with values from XXI century so there&#039;s nothing cringy about it. They focus a lot on psychologic situations that are later on expressed through musical theatre, although I would have loved to see more of that world. <br />
<br />
Still, the characters are remarkable and distinctive and you empathize a lot with them. They focused on every side story so that may be why it seemed so short for me. There&#039;s still content for a possible second season or OVAs and I&#039;d be happy to watch that very soon.

    I intend to watch this to help me get rid of my hatred toward women. It&#039;s because I need to constantly remind myself to stay objective and see the good side in those female characters. I actually hear a lot of praise from Japanese audience so I know this anime from personal ranking Japanese make on twitter. Never did I know the first problem this anime try to convey is hatred toward certain gender, the same problem I am struggling for so many years.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
This anime most likely inspired/based on real all-female theater company, Takarazuka. Until this point in story we already learn how competitive this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410278">
        school is. Competitive in here means that there are some standard for them to survive in this school and there will be some kind of drama among students. And it seems all characters struggling with some problem, even Sarasa. Until this point, we already see some character development from Ai and it seems we will see character development from another characters.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The main characters are Sarasa and Ai. Sarasa, she is full of positivity and seems really cheerful but you also realize from the foreshadowing that there is some problem she has. She looks airhead but from what she said you will also realize she is not as simple as she looks. What kind of problem she has? Why she specifically want to be Oscar? <br />
&quot;I was lucky enough to be born a girl&quot;. This words of her actually hit me a lot because never once in my life I feel lucky to be born as a girl and I feel more like cursed. So I want to follow the journey of Sarasa who speak like this about being a girl.<br />
<br />
Ai. I think how the author portray the cause and outcome of her trauma is really good. Not only that, but the author convey her feeling really well. I also like how they solve the problem by showing how the stalker is not as bad as he seems. It&#039;s because our hatred born from trauma and it makes us have bias perception of certain gender. To get rid of this, we need to fix our perception and I think the first step of Ai is also the same. She needs to see that not all men are scary, and some men that you think as bad maybe in fact good people.<br />
<br />
These two characters are so different and that&#039;s what make them mismatched at first and cause some tension (Sarasa who doesn&#039;t really have personal space want to be friend with Ai who doesn&#039;t want anything to do with other people). But I believe their differences will complement each other.<br />
<br />
It seems we will see problem of the other characters. We already see some foreshadow of problem they have like Ayako and Risa. It seems there will be some kind of drama start from Hijiri.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy this anime and I hope we will see more character development and how they will solve the problems of these girls!

    Kageki Shoujo!! is not afraid of telling raw and compelling stories, and that is what sets it apart from other shoujo anime.<br />
<br />
Kageki Shoujo!! is about a group of girls in their first year of one of the biggest schools of theatre and opera in Japan, called Kouka. It&#039;s an all-women school, and has about as much drama and sweet moments as you would expect. Some of the early episodes may be triggering for anyone with trauma, especially regarding sexual abuse, anorexia, bulimia, and abandonment. However, the show handles these sensitive topics with an amazing amount of awareness and care.<br />
<br />
The two main characters really draw you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410837">
        in, but especially Ai Narachi. She is a very reserved girl, who struggles to connect with others because her childhood trauma. The other main character, Sarasa Watanabe, is overly optimistic and wants to be friends with everyone. She brings a good balance to Narachi&#039;s struggles and levity to each episode. She is the person we all wish we could be. And all of the supporting characters bring their own unique spice to the cast. I can&#039;t help but anticipate how each of them will shape the story. <br />
<br />
The story so far has amazing momentum and makes me wish I could watch every episode today. The writers really know how to entangle your heart strings. You can&#039;t help but hold back the tears as you empathize with each character and their struggles, and hope they succeed! I will update this as more episodes are aired.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty good, but nothing outstanding. Sound is the one aspect I&#039;m hoping improves as more episodes are added. For being a story about an opera school, there is a dearth of music so far. But these early episodes have been about developing the characters, so hopefully there will be more music in the future. The snippets of music and singing we have gotten have been excellent.<br />

    Well let&#039;s go for Kageki Shoujo ! <br />
<br />
Story 9 : The story of Kageki Shoujo is really good. Especially the world building. I didn&#039;t see such a logical world building in a while. Because anime tends to not give any importance to this at the beginning and want to &quot;hook&quot; the viewer first which is understandable. In Kageki Shoujo, the world is build telling you the focus of the story, and the character development of Sarasa who is the MC, is adding value while the anime is continuing to the good base story building in the first episodes. So really well written.<br />
<br />
Art 7 : The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415948">
        art is good even if i&#039;m not particulary a fan of this, it&#039;s objectively good.<br />
<br />
Sound 7 : Quite typical, nothing out of the ordinary, but the ED is a banger.<br />
<br />
Character 9 : Really good character definition and development. That&#039;s the main attractive point of Kageki Shoujo. Both MC who are Sarasa and Ai are really well written. They aren&#039;t cliché at all and feel like real persons because of the quality of their definition. The development is really well done as well, we can see the character growth and evolution even though there is only 12-episodes, something some anime fails to do in 50 or 60 episodes. <br />
<br />
The side characters are also very interesting, they try to develop them as well but we can see it&#039;s taking a toll on the main story line development as it&#039;s only a 12-episodes season. Basically, if you focus on a side for one episode, you miss the main for one episode. It would have been better to find a way to link every development to the MC so we can develop their story as well.<br />
<br />
Another category I want to add, the Theme.<br />
<br />
Theme 10 : Here we are talking about acting. And to the last episode I&#039;ve seen which is the 8th the moment I&#039;m writting this review, the theme is really well explored. Comparing it to Skip Beat which is also about acting, in Skip Beat we feel like the romance and relationship in the cast the focus point and the acting is a side, Kyoko is in fact a genius without any training. In Kageki Shoujo, the main focus is the acting. How the characters are training for it, what you need to have to act, how the show business is structured for actress that comes out of their school etc. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s one thing I really liked, to focus on the world the author created and on Sarasa&#039;s dream to be on stage, and not lose that focus.<br />
<br />
Overall 8 :<br />
<br />
Kageki Shoujo is a great anime well written and very interesting to watch. The pace is really good changing from comedy to drama when it&#039;s necessary and the characters are interesting and endearing, That&#039;s a must-watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT COMPLETED :<br />
<br />
Everything is a 10 I don&#039;t care. KAGEKI SHOJO!!
