    Disclaimer that I am conversational-but-not-fluent so there were parts I didn&#039;t understand. That being said I also didn&#039;t entirely get what was going on in Summer Wars even with English subs and this is very much Same Energy. Anyway maybe it would help if I saw it again, but I found the story difficult to follow. It cuts between scenes really abruptly at times and things just seem to happen without a whole lot of buildup (Belle&#039;s fame and her/Suzu&#039;s relationships to Ryuu and other characters for instance). Also what are the mods doing? People are just getting doxxed left and right and no one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408476">
        is having their account frozen. The future is wild? It was also strange how in the ending, Suzu&#039;s friends and adult figures let her go out and do the Thing That Will Not Be Spoiled without any backup or any real plan. The visuals were pretty cool and the music was great, not very diverse but beautiful and cinematic. The characters are fine, but plain. Actually the support/background characters were more interesting. Also artistic references to Beauty and the Beast but only on a visual level. Basically if you liked Summer Wars back in the day also by Hosoda Mamoru (I did not), yes, this is definitely extremely similar but upgraded for 2021 with less family drama and more...family drama? But also singing.

    Watched this in theatres today. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. <br />
Story:<br />
6/10<br />
The story was pretty confusing with a lot of holes, but it served its purpose and held the movie together well enough. <br />
Art:<br />
9/10<br />
The visuals were appealing. I particularly liked the contrast between the online world and the real world. <br />
Sound:<br />
9/10<br />
The soundtrack went really well with the visuals, especially in a movie theatre. The sounds reverberating had a nice impact on me as I was watching.<br />
Character:<br />
7/10<br />
I didn&#039;t really like the protagonist, but she had her fair share of character development. The side characters were all pretty entertaining though. <br />
Enjoyment:<br />
8/10<br />
I walked out of the theatre satisfied

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409542">
        and thought it was a worthwhile 2 hours. However, I feel like most of the enjoyment came from the movie theatre experience though, with the visuals and soundtrack being the strongest parts.<br />
Overall:<br />
7/10<br />
I would tell others to watch it, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a movie I&#039;d watch again. In comparison to Bakemono no Ko and Wolf Children it was a letdown (two of my favorites), but overall it was good.

    &#039;Belle&#039; is a surprising anime. Firstly, because I wasn&#039;t all that informed about it and I was expecting a classic take on Beauty and the Beast and secondly because I didn&#039;t expect to get invested in a story of how J-Pop could save the world. Of course, it&#039;s far from flawless, it juggles with too many ideas and concepts for its own good and, at times, I couldn&#039;t help but &#039;ugh&#039; at the rather underdeveloped take on cyberbullying. It is still a delicate one when it comes to the topic (and on parental abuse and the other ideas floating around) and despite the idea of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420064">
        making a martyr out of yourself not being something I&#039;d get behind, it is done in a sensible manner and I can respect that. If you are not moved by anything regarding the story, the OST is surely going to do that, being done in a paying-homage-to-the-original way. It was reminiscent of it, in classic Beauty and the Beast fashion.<br />
<br />
Moreover, &#039;Belle&#039; is a gorgeous anime. The maximalism of Mamoru Hosoda&#039;s portrayal of the internet is mesmerizing and can be spotted from the first sequence, which, despite its over-the-top composition, is, plainly put, beautiful. The true beauty of this movie lies in the details and there are plenty of them to be appreciated. Even a single glance at the crowds would show that. I&#039;m not the biggest fan of 3dcg animation and I tend to dislike instances when it is used out of laziness or time constraints etc etc, but the world of &#039;U&#039; looks amazing and it just works. You can just tell when something was planned one way from the beginning, as the work put into it returned some great results. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to do a summary of the plot, assuming that you&#039;ve either watched it or, if you didn&#039;t, you wouldn&#039;t like being spoiled. Instead, I can guarantee that it makes for an enjoyable experience of new meets old, of &#039;a tale as old as time&#039; meets near-future tech. You have the mandatory ballroom sequence and the cheesy, heartfelt (and a tad bit subversive) finale I cannot help, but enjoy each time I see done. At the same time, you have a crazed search for a virtual persona&#039;s RL identity, dodgy crowd-funders, &#039;ENHANCE!&#039; software and a story about fixing the internet (to some extent at least). I am big on both SF and fairy tales, thus I had some hints that I might end up liking it.<br />
<br />
The astonishing aesthetic is backed up by a story portraying the ugliness of the online world, but with a twist and this twist is the main reason why I&#039;d easily overlook the flaws this series might have: a sincere belief in the potential and beauty of the internet. We can make an analogy to human interactions for example. Everybody might seem like a jerk, for it is really difficult to express our thoughts perfectly, unless we wrote a whole novel on it. Misunderstandings on top of misunderstandings lead to some rather interesting conversations for the third parties. I want to believe that most people on the internet or outside of it are rather nice and it isn&#039;t their intent to harass others, but it&#039;s rather difficult when someone just says that &#039;X anime is bad, why did you like it?&#039;. I&#039;m not saying that you should be looking for excuses for everyone, for that takes some effort and energy. But maybe that person was just trying to start a friendly debate with you or he was genuinely curious about it and he didn&#039;t pay enough attention to how he might come across to others. I feel like the same is true for the internet, for it&#039;s more common and much easier for it to be portrayed as a genuine source of negativity instead of the amazing concept that it is which allows people to shine. <br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say it&#039;s an experience that draws parts of its beauty from its flaws, a must for fairy tale enjoyers and something to look forward to for those who enjoy the wired. It is a story of acceptance of others and yourself, of coming to terms with reality told through a virtual one, of self-actualization. U is another reality. AS is another you. You can live as another you. You can start a new life. You can change the world. But is it truly another you or just a means to express some parts of your personality that also happens to impact it?

    Ryuu to Sobakasu no Hime reinforces the idea that a gold-covered turd, is at the end of the day, still a turd. This sorry excuse for a Beauty and the Beast inspired film falls short in many vital aspects, calling into question exactly &quot;whose idea was this?&quot; and &quot;did anyone really read the script?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Watching this film felt as though the director had cut out chunks from the storyline at random. Frequently, scenes would fail to adequately flesh out the narrative, resulting in an extreme lack of explanation for character motives or general functionalities of the world. Also present, was an excessive absence of continuity. In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420334">
        one scene, the main character, Suzu Naitou is running while putting on her device that allows her to connect to the world of &quot;U&quot;. As it turns on, she continues running, despite the fact that the app redirects her literal EYESIGHT in order for her to live in this separate world.<br />
<br />
The animation is fairly good, however, at times was very underwhelming. In particular, one scene later in the film ( a side character confession scene) has the female involved stand completely still for about a minute straight. It&#039;s as though she didn&#039;t disconnect from the app, but from life itself, reminding the viewer of the feeling of losing a teammate in an online game. <br />
<br />
The music composition is lovely, but is juxtaposed against an utterly mind-numbing script. If the soundtrack of the movie is on Spotify, I would highly recommend checking that out instead of watching the movie. <br />
<br />
Overall, this movie was a serious letdown, but was somewhat entertaining to laugh with friends who are just as confused about what is going at any given moment. <br />
<br />
P.S. All you have to do to stop abusive parents is stand in between them and their children. Afterwards, just let them live together like normal. Bing Bang Boom Pow, problem solved. <br />

    I think Hosoda is best suited for short films.<br />
I think it&#039;s time for him to realize that he excels in creating images and not in creating stories.<br />
However, if you look at the festival baron in One Piece, even if he had a scriptwriter, he would probably make up his own story...<br />
<br />
Although there are a few complaints, I think this is one of Hosoda&#039;s more interesting &quot;long&quot; films.<br />
<br />
First of all, the music is worthy of special mention.<br />
It is the closest to the image of a diva in a near-future science fiction film, and the music is dashing and wonderful.<br />
And the visuals that accompanied the music were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413694">
        wonderful. Director Hosoda&#039;s quintessential technique of mixing sound and images was also on display in this film. <br />
<br />
The story was based on Beauty and the Beast, so it was easy to get used to, and the characters&#039; personalities were familiar to me, capturing the historical background, so I could easily get into the story.<br />
<br />
However, on the other hand, the events in the story were more abrupt than in his acclaimed works.<br />
As much as he pursued reality, there were certainly parts where he dared to shun reality, which made me feel uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
The artwork was certainly inferior to that of &quot;Bakemononoko&quot; (Japanese title), but it was by no means bad. However, I was quite disappointed with the lame UI.<br />
Back in 2000, Hosoda was a creator of new things, but time is impermanent.<br />
<br />
I think this movie was challenging in its style, following Hosoda&#039;s traditional direction but also incorporating new areas, but I feel that it has yet to get rid of the feeling of being stuck in the past glory. I&#039;d like to see them try new themes while expanding on the good parts, but so far I haven&#039;t seen any extreme evolution, so I&#039;m 50/50 on whether I can expect more in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
細田監督が向いているのはショートフィルムなのだと思う。<br />
彼が優れているのは映像づくりであって、お話づくりでないということをそろそろ理解しても良いのではないだろうか。<br />
尤も、ワンピースのお祭り男爵を観るに、脚本家を立てたところで彼なりの物語に仕立ててしまうのだろうが…<br />
<br />
いささかの不満点はあるものの細田監督の”長尺”映画作品の中では面白い部類の作品だと思う。<br />
<br />
まず特筆すべきなのは音楽だ。<br />
近未来SFでの歌姫というイメージに最も近く、且つ颯爽感のある素敵な音楽だった。<br />
そして、音楽につける映像が素晴らしかったのは説明不要だろう。細田監督の真骨頂である音と映像をミックスさせる手法は。この作品手でも遺憾なく発揮されていた。<br />
<br />
物語は美女と野獣を下敷きにされたものだったのでとっつきやすく、キャラクターの性格も時代背景をとらえて馴染みやすいキャラクターになっていたので、すんなり物語が頭に入ってこれた。<br />
<br />
しかしその一方で、物語上のイベントの突拍子感は確かに彼の評価を受けている作品と比べると強かったのかなと思う。<br />
リアリティを追及している分、リアリティをあえて突き放した部分が違和感に感じる部分は確かにあった。<br />
<br />
作画は「バケモノの子(邦題)」と比べると、劣るのは確かだが、決して悪いということはなかった。ただUIのダサさにはかなりガッカリした。<br />
2000年当時の彼は新しいものを生み出すクリエイターだったのに、時は無常だ。<br />
<br />
今回の映画は従来の細田演出を踏襲しつつ、新たな分野も取り入れた挑戦的な作風だったと思うが、過去の栄光に囚われている感はまだ払拭できていないように感じる。良い部分を伸ばしつつ、新たなテーマに挑戦してほしいとは思っているが、極端な進化が今のところ感じられないので、今後に期待できるかは半々かな。

    As a big Mamoru Hosoda fan, his new movie &quot;Belle&quot; signified a return to what, in my opinion, had always been the director&#039;s strongest suit. After Wolf Children&#039;s depiction of a single mother&#039;s struggles, Bakemono no Ko&#039;s story about raising a kid on a magical world and Mirai no Mirai&#039;s four-year-old protagonist&#039;s tale, Hosoda was back at directing stories about high schoolers and high school life by extension.<br />
<br />
Belle&#039;s protagonist Suzu is a depressed 17-year-old girl that ends up hitting it huge as a mysterious singer on a virtual reality life simulator called &quot;U&quot;. I don&#039;t want to delve too much into this, but I feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420184">
        it might be necessary to as it does account for a huge portion of Belle&#039;s screentime. The digital hub people connect to in the movie feels very much like an afterthought. It&#039;s way too lifeless and generic, specially for a Hosoda movie. All we ever see users do while in &quot;U&quot; is fly through this city full of buildings and watch concerts. There&#039;s no reason 5 billion people around the world thought they couldn&#039;t miss out on this much fun. It also doesn&#039;t help that it&#039;s basically all done in CG (Crowds look Gross). At one point it even becomes difficult to understand how &quot;U&quot; can be accessed. Characters can be seen interacting with people in real life, then logged into &quot;U&quot;, back and forth, it&#039;s crazy.<br />
<br />
The other half of &quot;Belle&quot; is composed of the kind of slice-of-life magic patented by Hosoda. It&#039;s interesting and has some really fun cuts. I do wish it could have back some of the huge amount of time allocated to the Dragon&#039;s subplot inside &quot;U&quot; to develop the characters better. And that&#039;s not the only way in which the existence of the &quot;U&quot; harmed &quot;Belle&quot; as a movie. One of the merits of &quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&quot;, pointed out by reviewers at the time was how it &quot;instead of dealing with vast movements of history&quot;, chose to &quot;concentrate in the small movements in the emotional lives of its Japanese urban high school protagonists over several days.&quot;. In Belle however, we at times have the opposite. Suzu&#039;s alter-ego becomes an ultra pop-star and the whole internet stops to check out what she&#039;s doing. Talk about egocentrism.<br />
<br />
If you were to tell me, back in 2007, that this is what a Mamoru Hosoda feature would look like in the 2020&#039;s, I would have asked: &quot;Who the hell&#039;s Mamoru Hosoda?&quot;. But if you were to tell that to the community instead, I honestly don&#039;t think &quot;Belle&quot; is what they would expect. It doesn&#039;t feel like the work of the idiosyncratic director, who prioritized believable characters and making everyday life look fun above anything else. His new movie is a modern Japanese retelling of a Disney princess&#039; story, and it ends up being similar to a Disney movie in many ways. I still enjoyed watching it and, despite the many plot contrivances, it doesn&#039;t stop being a heartfelt and fulfilling movie that stays true to something Hosoda has always advocated for throughout his career.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I really want to capture are the moments that cause people to change, and also why people evolve into someone that differs from who they used to be. Those thoughts are always in my mind when I work.&quot;<br />
<br />
So go watch it!

    Mamoru Hosoda. This director should be considered one of the major powerhouses in the realm of animated films in Japan, it’s the same director that has been able to elicit worlds of thoughts from the viewers using its narrative and characters. The same can be applied to me as well. I consider myself a fan of his works, (used to consider myself anyway), but I wasn’t aware of the film Belle directed and written by Mamoru Hosoda before the news came out stating that Hosoda himself won a 14-minute standing ovation in the Cannes Film Festival for his new film, which caught my eye and

        prompted me to check out what his new film is, which turned out to be the aforementioned film, Belle, which I haven’t been able to watch until a few days ago. It’s a 2 hour film, not particularly noteworthy of its length but it’s definitely lengthy enough for some memorable sequences to be sprinkled throughout the film which I’ll be discussing here. <br />
<br />
[Spoiler alert for a number of scenes, or else it&#039;s impossible to write about a few major problems I find within the film.]<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, I really thought more deeply about this film (than I usually would for an anime film) for a while before writing this review, it’s really about something, but something also rings hollow throughout the film for me personally, but the script itself was convoluted to the point where it’s aiming to incorporate themes that are promising but way too ambitious -- considering the length of the film, is not enough, it’s far from enough. The film starts with a long shot which gradually gets larger as the camera swoops down to give us a clear shot of the internal environment of the platform of ‘U’, the opening shots are probably my favourite sequence of this film, it brings about the greatest strength of the film, which is of course, the aesthetical quality and how it slowly constructs an elegant virtual world imbued with exuberance after being inhabited by tens of millions of users from all over the world. This is a clear cut example of showing, instead of using more of the time for the narrator to further explain how the virtual world had created differences for the world, it used the few shots to convey such a simple idea -- that the virtual world was used and enjoyed by people from across the globe, regardless of race and gender, either as a platform for either escapism or even entertainment, it’s honestly remarkable to utilise its authentic aesthetic value to construct that sense of worldview. And that’s where the plot begins to unravel, a girl named Suzu, after the death of her mother, was affected greatly by this accident, in which her mother chose to save another girl and drowned herself, she was still considerably traumatised by it and haven’t really walked out of it even after several years and it had basically rendered herself unable to sing anymore. The first few minutes were able to impart these pieces and bits of information to me, but the scenes after the sweeping shots of the virtual world had me confused for a little while. If I were to describe this feeling after finishing this movie and after a rewatch of the first few scenes, I’d say this sense of confusion is probably arisen from my thoughts about a particular scene, where we have a few sped over pictures and frames where Suzu went to school, talks with her friends and family, went to a karaoke and ran out, and unable to sing on a winter’s day. It felt like I was being hit by a moving ticking clock that was sped up excessively, it’s more of a montage than it is a scene, as it mostly made up of stitched together images and compiled story beats that are very short (only a few seconds). These types of montages are constant -- in Hosoda’s films (which admittedly I’ve seen only five), case in point in The Girl Who Leapt Through Time where the relationship between Chiaki and Makoto are often sped through to focus more on the mechanics of plot, and in Wolf Children where Hosoda often glossed through the struggles Hana faces when fixing the house they had in the countryside. Whilst the concept of time and how it’s treated makes sense and fits in the themes of The Girl Who Leaped Through Time, not so particularly commendable in Wolf Children, but it’s quite clumsily done in Belle, what should’ve been more impactful in the relationships between Suzu and her deceased mother or her father is severely lacking in any sense of development. Barely any screen time was spent on building the preexisting setups of the film but more were spent on minutiae details on how Suzu had a complicated relationship with her childhood friend Shinobu and a weirdly shoved in subplot where Shinobu and Suzu was caught by some other students to have a more-than-conventional relationship, which I’d question. It’s not too much about how Hosoda can’t focus on scenes as Suzu having a budding crush on her childhood friend, that much I could tolerate, but if such unnecessary scenes weigh over the important details that are needed to set up to be paid off in the latter parts of the movie, I’d deem it really sloppily written, a thing I’ll reserve for the later part of the review. <br />
<br />
Mamoru Hosoda, though I certainly would not doubt his capabilities of directing itself, is an inherently flawed writer, he isn’t a writer that could create nuanced stories which feature great deal of character moments, his characters behave more caricaturistic than it is realistic. This is eccentric itself, as his shows usually don’t aim for fantasticality as Miyazaki do, or magical realism like Takahata do, but rather resorting to develop a dash of the eccentric within a seemingly realistic narrative. Now, caricature itself is neither a significant flaw nor even worth condemning about, Dickens used caricaturistic characters all the time throughout his oeuvre of work, but keep in mind Dickens knows how to use it perfectly, use it artistically to the point that even Nabokov is genuinely impressed by Dickens’ artistic cloud. But Hosoda isn’t Dickens, for he’ll never be able to use caricature well (for now, anyway), his principal inadequacy that lies within the story is how often he interweaves caricature with storyline, Dickens’ choice of caricature, though gross often but within the superficial surface of gross caricature lies moment of dramatic intent layered with wit and insight, created to infuse caricature with truth, usually utilising caricature for perversions of feelings and thought rather than impressing us with realistic depictions of a character. That itself is a phenomenal use of caricature, with Mr Bounderby representing a dramatic monster rather than a worldly boss, or Stephen Blackpool that is bound to perfection rather than being an honest workman that would’ve worked in real life parallels. But I found neither of those in Hosoda’s Belle. Saying Shinobu is caricature is untrue and a misuse of words, as there is nothing worth being caricatured in Shinobu, he’s synonymous to a part of the background, the words he mutter didn’t change much other than uttering Suzu for the umpteenth time, which itself is a waste of character. There’s a certain effect I can see Hosoda is trying to aim for, which I opine as the growth of Suzu and her maturation after her mother’s death, but it falls dramatically apart as Shinobu provides no juxtaposition to Suzu’s character other than being ‘otherworldly cool’ which sets him to be apart from the other boys, but mere praises and a few muttering of words are not character traits, neither are both of those presenting any semblance to the chance of giving him caricature, he’s just there for wasting potential screen time that could’ve been used for other purposes, for instance Belle’s relationship with the Beast, maybe even forming some sort of bond between Shinobu and Suzu? Those never came into existence, sadly, as Hosoda did not trust story beats, he trusts story arcs and acts, if you can’t even produce a few story beats well, it’s hard to say there would be any great scene, not to mention sequences or acts. It’s not even just Shinobu, the same can be said for a couple of characters, and yes, barring Suzu, we have a character Dragon that is basically developed almost in the third act of the film after Kei is introduced, any expert screenwriter with mickle experience would know that’s a ludicrous move, but Hosoda is a capable director, yet a subpar writer, in this film he did all the characters wrong, their motivations other than Suzu are simple mouthpieces for Hosoda to channel his opinions onto, the most vivid example being Kei, a character that is stuffed in none other than the reason to have some semblance of criticizing family abuse, but he is not given any kind of value for us to emphasize for, or even care about, as he appeared only in the last part of the movie. That’s not to say if he had appeared earlier it would be better, because Dragon is only an important thing after an hour of the film has passed by, which is a pretty meandering pacing with story beats accelerating and slowing down so randomly that it’s not even remotely funny. They’re milquetoast characters, not meaning feeble or timid, but a lack of defined, rigorous traits that sets them apart other than a few catchy phrases that are by no means synonymous to characterization.<br />
<br />
The process where Suzu stumble across the virtual world of ‘U’ to how she reinvents herself in the virtual world as Belle and how she sung her songs till the day she got widely acclaimed by the online users of ‘U’ and how she went up the ladder to become the diva of the highest popularity on the platform remains the most memorable sequence for me. The scene, in my honest opinion, had captured the essence of the Internet perfectly. How internet celebrities came into the public eye, how they performed and caught the public eye and how the public eye came to be aware of her and all the praises and blind hate showered upon her as her popularity skyrocketed in the first part of the film. There’s a kind of trend that you could see in Hosoda’ films, you can clearly see that he directs and produces a film about every a decade or so that centres around the topic of the Internet, it’s a really welcoming topic as the theme of online platforms is getting more relevant than ever, and Hosoda usually do bring a lot of new things onto the table and he typically observes the current climate of the internet well, it’s evident that he did do a great calibre of research while producing these films. To bring about some examples, we have the first few Digimon films in his body of work, its central theme talks about the Internet can bring about societal members that is scattered sporadically over the globe together, no matter how far we are from each other, and no matter how different we are in terms of gender, race, and background. Summer Wars focused on the gradual maturation of online platforms and how the unification of people of online platforms could be a potentially great power that would soon loom over the entire Internet, these themes are complementary with the period they’re in and are still fun rewatches over the years. Belle touches on such a common narrative thread, where our young, promising protagonist comes face to face with the current climate of the Internet, especially in an era where Japanese anime culture is increasingly prevalent with the popularisation of virtual youtubers and how they impact the traditional conception of an online celebrity, and it’s an era where Internet users are more than ever, and has been growing rapidly, accelerated by the events that mirrored the pandemic. It’s also a pretty impressive reflection on the contemporary issues of online users, where everybody was subconsciously eager to tear down the faces of their favorite celebrities, finding out their identities and subsequently bellowing yells of triumphs when they had discovered the backgrounds of the celebrities. So, the movie really starts to trade in big ideas when the diva Belle’s rise in popularity is also juxtaposed with how eager the internet users are to discover her true identity. Hosoda definitely had plenty of fascinating concepts and ideas while keeping abreast with modern Internet cultures. However, there’s a common issue that raises a critique on Hosoda’s films which I’ve been seeing for quite a while ever since I started reading criticism from Japanese articles, that he’s quite a good conceptualizer or an ideator, he excels in thinking innovatively while coming up with barebone synopsis and movie concepts, as shown in Belle, where he had a discernible favour for quite a few prevailing themes in the film, but to translate this interesting ideas into some sort of screenplay where the story would inevitably geared around is not his cup of tea. It’s definitely perceptible ever since Satoko Okudera no longer works as a screenwriter for the last three movies of his, and Hosoda himself takes over as the screenwriter to pen the scripts he directs. How is it evident, you’d say? Well, the movie has a strong 25-minute start where tons of flashy expository scenes are shot where expository dialogues are portrayed in a way that is not boring and has a sense of cinematic verve in them. But it starts to get troublesome when Hosoda seemingly doesn&#039;t know where to go on with the story. Ever since the introduction of the character ‘Dragon’, things start to go downhill, the tone changes from an exhilarating exploration of the online ‘U’ virtual world and its ensuing processions and cultures to a kind of mystery story where everybody starts to investigate the identity of Dragon. It’s done so suddenly and out of random to introduce Hosoda’s pie-in-the-sky ideas about everybody trying to rip apart the Dragon’s identity, until it starts to rob Suzu of her character development. She went from trying to adapt herself in this new identity to trying to know who this ‘Dragon’ character is, which irks me terribly. I felt like Suzu’s struggles as an online Diva was glossed through yet again, as Hosoda did in Wolf Children’s character of Hana, to introduce another subplot where everybody attempts to find out who Dragon is. This type of tonal shift is relentless in this movie, in my first count, there’s basically 5 different tones spread throughout the movie with a total of 4 tonal shifts, it went casually from a girl who went through serious transformation on an online platform to be a Diva, then another subplot introduces an element of mystery by having the users figuring out who Dragon really is, then it shifts again to introduce a sequence with a Beauty and the Beast styled character drama between Belle and Dragon, followed by a convoluted and confusing sequence of chasing and some random person who called themselves the guards tracking down Dragon and tried to kill Belle and is then subdued by an upcoming sequence where Belle and a gang out of nowhere trying to save the real-life Dragon -- a boy called Kei (have an awkward ‘I love you’ scene) to the final scene where Suzu goes forward to save Kei and his brother from being abused by their father. This is tonally a mess, it’s trying to cram six different sequences that are tangential to each other at surface value and tries valiantly to merge them up together, but to awkward results. The screenplay itself crumbles due to an incoherent structure, certain subplots are either way too dragged out, some are unnecessary and some were grossly oversimplicated. To illustrate my point further, there’s a small subplot before the climax of the film where Suzu helps Ruka to confess to Kamishin, and that small subplot alone lasted for almost 7 minutes. It’s offensively banal to include such a scene because overall it serves no purpose to the film itself, Ruka and Kamishin can’t even considered a side character, they’re minor, and they’ve none of the development that Suzu previously undergoes, so I’m kind of flabbergasted to see Hosoda adding such a redundant scene into the narrative while completely demolishing the relationship between Suzu and the Dragon. That’s a scene that we needed, because in the end of the film we’d need to have these scenes so that their relationship pays off in the final end of the film. But, it accomplishes none of those. All the value of the relationship between Belle and Dragon is undercut by the lesser amount of screen time the screenplay has given them. It’s insufficient, we get sort of a montage where there’s a few scenes that clearly takes direct inspiration from Beauty and the Beast, but an inferior version of it. Why is it inferior? It’s of the utmost importance to remark that Belle and the Beast’s relationship in Beauty and the Beast is tested throughout the film and the Beast is given ample time to develop, where he faces his inner demons and begins to discover his true self. Though it’s really hard for the Dragon to discover his real best self in this movie….. Because there is none.<br />
<br />
Why? Because the subplot once again shifts from a mystery to learn the identity of the Dragon to a tale of redemption, salvation to find your best self within the darkness of your heart, which is exactly what Beauty and the Beast is about. But Belle isn’t Beauty and the Beast, it’s a wolf that coats itself as the grandmother, it’s a movie that latches itself onto a pretension of a great, vivid schema that is Beauty and the Beast without learning what the animated movie was about. The part of the film about Belle and the Dragon is hilariously snipped from Beauty and the Beast and stuffed into the movie without any focus on their relationships and dynamics thus producing something that can only be described as ‘dismayingly unsatisfying’.<br />
<br />
It’s by my accounts unsatisfying, because Hosoda insists on distilling a plot that should’ve been the main focus of the film (even in the movie poster itself…..) down to its climaxes, which includes the process of Belle meeting the Dragon and questioning who he is (Belle and the Beast), how Belle gets to interact with the Dragon, though laughably minimal (Belle in the castle with the Beast) and songs that are sung by Belle in the Dragon’s castle. (original Belle in the castle). Those are pretty discernible parallels that can be seen by even casual audiences leaping into the theatre for fun, while Beauty and the Beast does this in 84 minutes by detailing the plot with beautiful moments of Belle gradually learning to care for the Beast whilst Beast went on to discover his best self after his interactions with Belle and thorough inner reflections. But the film Belle presumably thought that it would work by scrapping the highest moments in the original Beauty and the Beast movie and inserting it into this film would produce an equally great effect and have a long lasting impact on the audience, but it doesn’t. We don’t even get to know who the Dragon is until the final act, we don’t know his backstory (though there are moments where Dragon is revealed to have serious bruises, deemed as ‘foreshadowing’, but other than that, there’s still nothing), it’s just him regurgitating some edgy phrases and constantly spewing out his irascible and irritable dialogue of ‘You don’t know me’, ‘Get off of me!’, ‘Get out of here’, ‘Goooooo!’ and……? What does that have to do with Belle or even Dragon as a character? And why did he suddenly warm up to Belle after a mere time frame of 10 minutes where he saves her from the worse and far annoying ‘cops’ which I view as nothing but nuisance to the plot, because it’s just a not-so-covert attempt at reinventing the character Gaston that I cared about in the original Beauty and the Beast for being a threat and an actual influencer for the overarching plot throughout the narrative, but this random guy with neon backgrounds of ads and sponsorships are simply getting in the way of forming a bond between Belle and Dragon. How is that earned? Since when they’ve reached such a profound relationship that the Dragon is willing to pull such desperate measures to save Belle who he deems as constantly interrupting himself when they have had the barest interaction between each other? Or is it simply a convenience to galvanize the plot further? Or is it some part of the screenplay that didn’t transfer well into a film with visuals? I saw some criticisms from Asian countries’ reviews where they were frustrated by the film’s decision to omit romantic scenes, to be fair to this film, it never actually sets itself up as a romantic film, I respect the film’s decision to use the story frame of Beauty and the Beast to construct a meaningful conflict and detailing the budding relationship (not romance) between Belle and Dragon (which seems promising at first glance, as I’m sure that Hosoda can do much more than a romance film whilst emphasizing on forging bonds between a random pair). However, I do not view it as being well-constructed, it’s infuriating for me to see Hosoda being so condescending and derogatory towards his own characters, his own creation and insulting them by having them playing out some silly romantic comedy between two unimportant characters instead of developing the one that matters, the one that should’ve bring about the greatest payoff in the movie…. Which I’m going to get into right now, and I’m more than just disappointed in the final act of the film.<br />
<br />
I think the final act suffers immensely from the lack of exploration in Kei’s backstory and how it complements the issue of family abuse that I could clearly see Hosoda trying his best to explore in the final act, but truth be told, I found his proneness to compile a number of scenes that should’ve been evenly spread out more to be a serious problem right here. Kei’s background is supposedly juxtaposed with the internet users’ propensity to ignore or even having ‘pretending to care’ attitude in the implied scenes, but the huge issue here is how the theme is handled. Hosoda doesn’t seem to know the principles of screenwriting here, you’d never, ever see a character introducing his backstory in the final act of the film, and he’s barely a character even after the review of his supposed background story. Because there’s no character other than his family abuse. That’s the major complication right here, you can’t really have one of our main characters to have some surface level of background and expect it to work out as emotionally powerful as you’ve thought. Kei only exists because Hosoda want to criticize the central issue of family abuse that is pervasive in society, and to be said, it’s actually nice to see an animated movie willing to discuss real life issues instead of providing endless escapism and imagined relationships like Shinkai’s films do (though not necessarily a bad thing), We need the spiritual successors to Takahata’s Grave of the Fireflies and Miyazaki’s The Wind Rises that are willing to reflect on society’s complications and its dark histories. In spite of that, I think these kinds of social critiques sound good on paper, or sound good purely in terms of the screenplay, but digesting a screenplay and then reformatting it in a visual based movie isn’t exactly the same thing, which is why I think the social critique of family abuse doesn’t work as well as Hosoda would like to imagine here. The entrails of this ‘family abuse’ act is bungled by Hosoda, as it explores this theme only close to the end of the show, which is clumsily done if we look at it from the aspects of a screenplay, let’s examine a better example. Takahata’s Grave of the Fireflies and why it works. The reason why Grave of the Fireflies works as a critique because it allows to forge a bond and emotional bridge with the two main characters Seita and Setsuko in the first parts of the film, where we could peek into their lives before the war arrives, and how the war gradually impacts them by taking away their mother through a tragic death, how Seita struggles to save himself and Setsuko, how Setsuko slowly crumbles physically and mentally in the events of war and how it lead to the downfall of Seita as well. I think Roger Ebert puts it the best. The film’s greatest gift is not told as melodrama, but in simple neorealist drama, And there is time for silence in it. One of the film’s greatest gifts is its patience; shots are held so we can think about them, characters are glimpsed in private moments, atmosphere and nature are given time to establish themselves, it also meditates on the cause-and-effect of the arrival of war and how it slowly perforates the lives of the people in it. I think the biggest reason Belle fails as a social critique is because it spent a surfeit of time on themes like student romance while only trying to ‘tell’ us about how Kei and his brother suffers under family abuse, but even the scene of family abuse and how it impacted Kei is directly told, towards us and towards Suzu, we aren’t allowed to feel for Kei, as we have no ties previously to him, there’s no glimpse into his life and why family abuse is exactly this terrifying and how it destroys his personal life. Belle has only sojourned in my mind for a while, as it exploits Kei as a character to deliver the theme, instead of filling the character Kei to deliver on this theme, these two things are wholly different, and it delivers wildly varying strengths when it comes to the emotional feels of the film. What is even more ironic, say, is that Takahata seems to aim more for a fantastical side of animation, which combines a lack of visual realism with plasticity of character (big eyes with tonsils to be seen clearly), to produce a reality that is heightened and simplified to hit at the deepest of our hearts, instead of reproducing reality like Hosoda but castrating it with a million quirks of his own to include melodrama with no character truths and simple characters that make no part in the film to spew out unerring comments like Shinobu that I would akin it to micturate pretentions excessively to impress me. <br />
<br />
Before ending this review, I’d say the single biggest problem in this film lies in the last sequence, where Belle discovers the identity of Kei is the most emotionally awkward sequence I’ve ever seen and the sole embarrassment from this sequence…… I’m not ashamed to say I laughed through the entire final sequence instead of being emotionally attached to it. And how they resolve the family abuse sequence angers me. Why? I’ll explain it in detail here. Suzu immediately travels to Tokyo to help Kei -- by herself, yes, there’s about 10 or more people at the scene when they discover the fact that Kei is abused -- yet all 10 people leave Suzu, a roughly 16-17 year old girl, to go and resolve the family abuse problem. The process of resolving isn’t just ludicrously stupid, it rips the supposedly ‘realistic’ show of any logic. Personally speaking, I’ve always viewed logic as unnecessary and overrated in films, but the film here is clearly geared towards portrayal of realism, yet it resolves its central conflict in the most unrealistic way possible whilst trying to criticize society, it’s juvenile and honestly absurd. Shinobu, despite having guise of relationship with Suzu, is there a good-looking vase there, and he encourages her to go and meet Kei whilst never actually does anything and simply uses his mouth, which is the most prominent problem in the entire Japanese anime industry, vocal cords are more powerful than action itself. The issue isn’t the point that she acts blindly and impulsively without thinking rationally, but the problem is……. There’s so many other problems. I think another critic A Jie points out this pretty well (a really thoughtful one), but his videos aren’t subtitled so I’ll regurgitate his very good points here: A character in a melodramatic narrative can resort to impulsive acts, similar to how people in real life can succumb to immediate response during emergency without thinking through twice, but the impact is lessened when we’re given ample time to think rationally as an audience. Melodramatic essence is essentially vanquished while you’re giving the audience too much time to think, because the audience are not subdued by the tight tension that is absolutely permeated and pervasive in the scene, if the tension is ridiculously overpowering and the stakes are at an abnormally high, we might be swept away by the conglomeration of painful stakes and tension and be inclined to do the same as the character. Akin to how Wolf Children had Hana chasing after her son Ame after he turns into a wolf, she chases after him desperately and forgets about her daughter trapped in the school by typhoon. Though I thought that scene is also severely lacking in other aspects, it did pull out how the stakes might alter the show forever and Hana might not be able to see her son anymore, but in Belle the impact is far more gelded. There’s a few scenes: the striding under the rain in the streets of Tokyo, the moment in the bus where she messages her dad on the phone, the group discussing how to help Kei. There’s too many scenes like this that created sparse moments amongst scenes that should’ve been tense, until the irrational response was rendered with impertinence and considered an umbrage by the audience.<br />
<br />
The tragedy of Belle is that it’s a movie with a ragtag collection of phenomenal elements, mingled with one of the most beautiful animations and visual art styles in recent years, along with some of the most mesmerizing soundtracks of all time. But it’s deleterious for us to consider this a great film simply because of the great soundtracks and animations. I’d prefer not to lie to myself about the quality of the film, though I loved certain scenes of the film. But Hosoda, you’re not a capable screenwriter, and through this film I can see the potential, but the actual result is utterly outlandish, and is probably one of the biggest disappointments for me personally.<br />

    Let me preface this review by saying that I love Mamoru Hosoda. I&#039;ve seen the vast majority of his directorial output from the silver screen to the small screen. He directs with a deft hand, making the absolute most of any budget he&#039;s given. The episodes he&#039;s directed in TV anime, imbued with his distinct sensibilities, are the high water mark of any series they&#039;re a part of.<br />
<br />
But Belle is simply baffling.<br />
Belle makes for the third time Hosoda has revisited the concept of an virtual world. A fact that worried me before the film was even released because I don&#039;t believe Hosoda has any real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422244">
        grasp of the internet. Oz, his previous depiction of a virtual space found in Summer Wars, felt like a fantasy setting rather than speculative fiction. But oh how I miss Oz when I compare it to Belle&#039;s world of U. Hosoda, and by extension the audience, has such a poor grasp of the inner workings and mechanics of U that any narrative he places within it crumbles.<br />
<br />
Belle is about a introverted girl named Suzu (the Japanese word for bell) who finds popularity as her online persona named Belle in the virtual world of U due to her amazing singing, something she is too afraid to do in the real world. Except not really because that plot line is speed through in a montage. The plot is actually a Beauty and the Beast story. Except for when it isn&#039;t, which is most of the time. The abruptness of these plot points and their on again off again nature is fast enough to make anyone&#039;s head spin.<br />
<br />
Hosoda&#039;s films have not been the same since he and his long time script writer Satoko Okudera parted ways. Okudera worked on what I consider Hosoda&#039;s best films, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Wolf Children. Even Summer Wars (my least favourite Hosoda film until Belle) is a perfectly pleasant watch, thanks in part to her no doubt.<br />
<br />
Hosoda has been the sole script writer on his films since Boy and the Beast. And while that was still a standout effort, it marked a shift in the writing style of his works. Hosoda has felt unfiltered ever since, adding anything and everything to his works. His scripts becoming increasingly bloated and convoluted.<br />
<br />
Even Hosoda&#039;s directing gets muddled in Belle, with half the film being in CGI to portray the virtual world of U. These portions of the movie were outsourced to Cartoon Saloon, best known for their gorgeous hand drawn films about Irish folklore. So it&#039;s odd to see them commissioned to work on CGI. That&#039;s not to say they did a bad job though. The CG animation is expressive but most of the character designs are overblown and the world they inhabit feels paper thin. Nothing about the virtual world of U makes any sense and most prominent glimpse into this world we ever get is a sea of avatars placed in a large void with indistinct buildings in the far off distance.<br />
<br />
This sever lack of world building leaves me wondering how U works on even a fundamental level. Placing any story in this setting invites confusion at every turn, creating an incoherent mess with logic gaps everywhere.<br />
<br />
There are still tender, well executed moments found in Belle but they&#039;re few and far between, found almost exclusively in its hand drawn segments. Honestly, if the film focused on Suzu finding confidence as her online persona which in turn gave her the courage to mend the fractured relationships in her life, that would&#039;ve been enough.<br />
<br />
Instead, Belle is less than the sum its parts and stumbles at every opportunity. The competing plot lines battle for screen time, leaving the narrative under-baked. The CG world of U doesn&#039;t leave room for Hosoda to stretch his usual directorial muscles. The cast is overloaded, forcing characters, their development and relationships to be sidelined.<br />
<br />
In the end, Belle has too many ideas and lacks the ability to implement them into a cohesive whole.

    In the first half of the movie, it was great, but then it lost me and things started making less and less sense by the end, which left me outright confused and at a loss for words. I have to say, I&#039;m pretty disappointed, so disappointed that I&#039;m making this &quot;review&quot;. The writing for this was just bad, there&#039;s no other way to really describe it. It&#039;s like the director/writer combined all his movies into one at the end and created this jumbled or convoluted mess. This is my first time seeing a story devolve like it did. It was like I was watching a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420137">
        completely different movie by the second half of the movie. At first, I didn&#039;t even realize this was directed/written by the same person as Bakemono no Ko, Ookami Kodomo, Summer Wars, Digimon Adventure Movie, etc. Those movies are probably one of my favorite anime movies and so naturally, I &quot;should&quot; like this movie, yet I don&#039;t. So, it definitely was not a matter of expectations as I had none. If you decide to watch this movie, have the lowest possible expectations for some enjoyment.

    I&#039;ll get straight to the point: I don&#039;t like this movie. It&#039;s somewhat nice to look at and listen to at best, and downright painful to watch at worst.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a spoiler warning as it&#039;s a bit hard for me to explain myself without pointing out specific examples.<br />
<br />
Belle is a movie that follows Suzu and her experiences with the world of &quot;U&quot;, a virtual environment where everyone can be the best versions of themselves, bringing out their true, hidden potential from within. As the name may somewhat suggest, another major part of the plot is its parallelism with another popular work, Beauty and the Beast.<br />
<br />
To give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423853">
        credit where credit is due, the concept is not bad. Virtual worlds can be done very well and there is a lot that can be explored with this premise. Part of this is fully realized with the presentation of Belle - the virtual segments are animated in 3D in contrast to most of the real life scenes being in 2D. While the movie isn&#039;t anything super stunning all things considered, never would I say it looks bad. Good visuals aside, what really brings out the best in Belle is the sound. All the songs are genuinely quite good, and the best parts of the movie, in my opinion, are the performances of these songs.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that&#039;s about where most the positives end for Belle.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m not saying every movie or any anime in general needs to have a super deep story that tackles some real-world issue and makes you analyze every part of the plot. The story doesn&#039;t have to be some world-shattering, revolutionary masterpiece. That being said, I at least expect some sort of coherence. The best way I can describe Belle&#039;s progression and pacing is that things just happen. There&#039;s often no flow or connection between events, just a jumble of things that occur. Why is there suddenly a fight scene out of nowhere? Why did we cut to a scene of Suzu fending off against gossip of a crush?<br />
<br />
This especially begins to affect the plot starting in the second half of the movie, where many plot points also just seem to pop up inexplicitly, and bring up more questions than it ever should&#039;ve. What makes this even worse is that because of the sheer amount of subplots adding on, each one of the subplots are “resolved” in a way that feels very lackluster. The worst one of these, in my opinion, is when one of the subplots chose to take on abusive family members. Not only did this feel like a last minute plot point, it was portrayed in a way that made it end as abruptly as it began. Ironically enough, the movie even had one of the characters point out in the dialogue that the conflict wasn&#039;t something that could be easily solved, but no, the abuser backs down after a very, very intimidating stare, and we&#039;ll just accept that the issue is solved after some people find out about it despite the victim clearly expressing that people knew about it before. Cool.<br />
<br />
Speaking of dialogue, some of the writing is downright laughable at times.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Belle.”<br />
“Thanks.”<br />
<br />
Who wrote this? Have they even talked to another human being in the past decade? And no, it’s not me cherry picking a line out of context to make it seem bad. If anything, it makes LESS sense with context.<br />
<br />
This so-so writing partially contributes to the fact that none of the prominent characters are really that likeable to me. In a world that’s functionally realistic besides the wacky virtual world which is essentially an MMORPG social media, most of the characters’ actions rarely makes them feel believable, and instead just makes them come off as silly and sometimes straight up annoying. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of things that straight up don&#039;t make any sense from a worldbuilding perspective either. Why is the moderation so lax in U that people can literally doxx others with no repercussions? Why does a random user have the ability to carry out the role of a moderator despite not being one? How extensive even is U that a random user can have AI that bends to their will, as well as hide a castle in this virtual world they don’t own? How are people going into U at will anytime and anywhere despite U very evidently taking control of the user&#039;s senses from the second it begins? <br />
<br />
I understand &quot;rule of cool&quot;, and going for style and impact over logic; I can absolutely accept going for cooler stuff rather than the most logical conclusions for the sake of drama and action. Belle, however, just makes random scenes that don’t leave me in awe, but instead comes off as pure stupidity that leaves me in confusion. I’m also not expecting every writer who works on a science fiction film to have a complex understanding of AI and the virtual world, and to give an in-depth explanation on everything. However, when much of Belle’s narrative relies on these very obvious oversights that keep adding up, it makes it incredibly hard for me to suspend my disbelief.<br />
<br />
Belle is a new take of Beauty and the Beast that tries to implement a poorly thought out virtual world in its setting, as well as tackle more plot points than it could feasibly do so. Save yourself the time and just listen to the soundtrack.

    I&#039;m not gonna say that I&#039;m disappointed but there is so much build-up that has no direction. So many hollow characters that seem interesting but never explore even for &quot;the dragon&quot; himself. At first, it feels like it&#039;s going for a romantics kinda a route because of the childhood friend and everything that happened to Suzu but suddenly the story took a 180-degree turn to another story at the final half of the movie. Basically, the storyline is not consistent. Which lead to a very OKAY kinda ending.<br />
<br />
Despite all of that, the music and visual is god tier. I can cry just for the music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420163">
        and visuals alone. The studio is not pulling any punches. The virtual and reality were both beautifully animated. Character design is great. The music too is beautiful as the animation itself. <br />
<br />
MUSIC &amp; ANIMATION = 11/10<br />
STORY &amp; CHARACTERS = 6/10<br />
<br />
Is it worth the watch? <br />
<br />
Yes...Definitely worth the watch.

    Another amazing movie by Studio Chizu.<br />
<br />
ART: 10/10<br />
This is the best 3D animation in an anime I&#039;ve seen in my life, the 2D backgrounds and scenery were on part, if not better than from movies like in, or similar to Kimi no Na Wa. This movie is definitely a graphical wonder.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 10/10<br />
One of the main things in the movie is singing and music, and trust me when i say they made the sound part on par with the animation, just captivating.<br />
<br />
STORY and CHARACTERS: 7/10<br />
The story and the characters aren&#039;t really the strongest points of this movie. It&#039;s not a movie that&#039;s meant to be watched multiple

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420153">
        times to understand the deep meaning behind it or to think about it for days after watching about the complex and deep story in it. No - it&#039;s a movie about singing, it&#039;s meant to be felt, not analysed, so all in all, the story and characters aren&#039;t the most important parts, so it&#039;s not really necessary for them to be the best.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT and OVERALL SCORE: 9/10<br />
I was surpised to see MAL rating at only ~7.5. That&#039;s probably because people try to look for deep meanings, perfect story pacing and perfect characterisation, sometimes forgetting that some things aren&#039;t meant to be overanalysed but are just meant to be enjoyed and felt in the moment.<br />
<br />
The climax of the anime was just amazing, that scene alone was definitely a 10/10, but summing everything up, in total i would say this movie is a very strong 9/10.

    If you&#039;ve watched Mamoru Hosoda films before, you already know what you are getting into: fantastic world-building at the expense of a not so straightforward story. Belle is no exception to this which draws both positives and negatives to the overall experience.<br />
<br />
As soon as the film begins, you are immediately transported into the virtual world of U that is beautiful, but is by no means original concept-wise. It isn&#039;t the stunning animation alone that pulls you in, but the OST that wholeheartedly carries this film and the very reason why my overall review score was bumped up one point higher. <br />
<br />
The story is no doubt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420149">
        convoluted, but with time you can eventually see what Hosoda was trying to go for by the very end, which can be frustrating as you&#039;re three-quarters into the film and still don&#039;t understand what is going on. You only have mere hints to go off of and only yourself to rely on during this journey. <br />
<br />
The main fault in Hosoda&#039;s storytelling lies in the pacing and gaps in the plot. The timeline is rushed at moments which really hinders the viewer&#039;s ability to connect with the main character (Suzu) during such an important part of her story. This lack of progression makes her sudden change in personality a little confusing at first.<br />
<br />
Suzu is a relatable character and you can really sympathize with her. She has lost her identity after experiencing a traumatic event and is introduced to a community where she regains the ability to express herself again. It&#039;s a &#039;lose yourself, find yourself&#039; concept that I think we can all relate to some degree. We see her boost in confidence over the course of the film but her character seems to be all over the place in this regard. Through the direction of the film, you are led to believe that joining U has helped Suzu for the better, but despite being able to find herself again, she still fails to overcome her anxiety when it comes to relationships with her family and friends until the very end.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen several people point out how Belle is inspired by Beauty and the Beast. You can definitely make parallels to the iconic fairy tale as there are scenes that are nearly mirror images of the original. However, aside from those aesthetic similarities, Hosoda makes this story his own. I had been expecting an exact tell of the Beauty and the Beast, but when you look outwards the story takes a whole different direction which was a pleasant surprise. My only gripe as I said at the beginning of this review, is that it takes us nearly till the end to understand what is going on. <br />
<br />
Overall, if you&#039;re fine with a mediocre story you should definitely give it a watch. The animation is great and the OST is superb. I went into this film blind and came out pretty satisfied. The only thing I suggest for people in a similar situation is don&#039;t expect to be blown away story-wise, but get ready to be immersed in the truly breathtaking world of U.

    Some will say this movie took the classic tell of beauty &amp; the beast and put a modern twist on it, but I think it&#039;s so much more then this.<br />
They took the basic idea of a popular girl meeting a &quot;monster&quot; and getting to know his softer side and turned it into a completely new and beautiful story.<br />
<br />
I loved the idea of the virtual reality app, and Belle - the popular DIVA of said app - being just a simple highschool girl in real life.<br />
<br />
The art was stunning, the songs and the background music were beautiful as well.<br />
Characters felt very real, relatable &amp; believable.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420115">
        half as kitschy and expected as I thought it was gonna be.<br />
<br />
Just a very emotional &amp; human movie, about how we don&#039;t even realize how much we can effect others just by interacting with them on social media.<br />
<br />
Of all the anime movie I watched, this one I will remember as enjoyable &amp; highly recommended

    My friend told me before we watched this movie that it received a 14 minute standing ovation on its debut. After watching this terrorist attack on the soul of a movie, I&#039;m only left asking, &quot;How?&quot; The worst movie I have ever seen, period. That includes the likes of &#039;The Room&#039;, &#039;Birdemic&#039;, and &#039;Battlefield Earth&#039;.<br />
<br />
The story is hollow, boring, does not earn its climax in the slightest, predictable, jarring, had countless plot holes, and lifted most if not all of its ideas from the director&#039;s previous works and &#039;Beauty and the Beast&#039;. In almost every scene, I felt as if I had seen it done

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423539">
        much better before. The themes were more undeveloped than an aborted fetus. I get what Hosoda was going for, but he missed the mark and impales the audience&#039;s patience with his arrow.<br />
<br />
The 3D art-style was abhorrent. Hosoda&#039;s &#039;virtual reality&#039; gets worse with every interpretation. To call it paper-thin would be a disservice to paper. Don&#039;t expect any world-building, instead endure through the vapidity of nothingness. I cannot comprehend how these apps work on a fundamental level: what is everyone doing? Do people sign into these apps and just blindly follow people around with no apparent purpose? Has Hosoda ever used the internet before? &#039;Our War Game!&#039;, nostalgia for Digimon aside, was relatively groundbreaking for the year 2000 but nothing special in hindsight, &#039;Summer Wars&#039; was a disappointing interpretation but tolerable, and whatever this movie was was genuine eyeball torture. But on the contrary, I&#039;ve always like Hosoda&#039;s traditional animation and it was at its best in this movie. <br />
<br />
Regarding sound, the songs were cliche and could&#039;ve been written by an edgy teenager. I suppose that makes sense considering our nervous wreck of a protagonist. I find it hard to believe that millions of people would pop-off to &#039;la la la la la&#039;. <br />
<br />
I have so little to say about the characters, if you could even refer to them as that. These soulless creations are flatter than an old, opened can of coke. Suzu and the Beast are poorly done sympathy bait; you would think I could relate to characters to which I&#039;ve shared similar experiences, but the execution was almost insulting. Shinobu is a one-note protector archetype. Hiroki is a bootleg Izumi or Oz. The other characters aren&#039;t even worth wasting words on, especially the antagonist if you can even call him that.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on and on, but I&#039;ve already collapsed the worldwide salt economy. I have nothing positive to say except it&#039;s over. My explanation for the ovation was people being glad it was finally over.<br />
<br />

    ART<br />
The visuals were amazing. I&#039;m not quite sure if it&#039;s considered CGI, or if it is, what kind of advanced insanely smooth CGI was used, but the difference between the virtual world and the real world was easily distinguishable without having that clunky, goofy appearance like in some other anime that use CGI. <br />
<br />
SOUND &amp; STORY<br />
The use of subtle hints for many of the main points of the movie, and musical accompaniment to really drive the emotions up, was immaculate, to the point where I only really understood what I&#039;d understood after watching it again (I&#039;ve watched Belle 4 times in the last 27 hours,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423187">
        3 of which were basically back to back). To clarify, the first run through was a little confusing at parts, and the story appears at first to be strangely paced and have weird cut scenes, but that only made me more invested honestly. <br />
<br />
Watching again, I realized the nuances of the pacing and cuts, especially when paying more attention to the music in the background. Dramatic pauses and non-verbal imagery are used a lot in this movie. There could be a little more direct explanation in some parts, like The Dragon&#039;s &quot;bruises&quot; just looked like decoration on the cape at first and I had no idea what they were even talking about when they said &quot;bruises,&quot; or the whole Origin reveal scene, for example. It&#039;s not a straightforward, cut and dry kind of story, it is very much emotionally charged and if you&#039;re not good at reading the intent behind faces and/or musical scores some scenes might not make much  sense on your first time watching. This is why I gave the story an 8, cuz I don&#039;t think you shouldn&#039;t have to watch something more than once to understand it 100%, in my opinion, so they could have tried a little harder to be a little more clear in some parts for people who don&#039;t want to spend a day and a half doing mental gymnastics and analyzing the whole movie three more times to figure it all out.<br />
<br />
The themes of this movie are fairly serious and really relevant to today&#039;s social media climate. We are shown a range of emotions, from loss, grief, and anger, to anxiety, depression, and abuse and how the charters handle these kinds of emotions and situations. We also have all the good and the bad that come from internet fame, the horrors and harm of online bullying, doxing, and, interestingly enough, the complex nature of not only online policing, but individual autonomy when it comes to online policing. There&#039;s even a clear representation of a child-friendly space (not sure if it was an app or maybe just a channel, but there was a mascot and Suzu had a keychain with that mascot which I&#039;m guessing is why we even get shown content from that place, other than to further the plot of the story) that are being invaded by adults, and it touches on the how mainstream social media/media silences or invalidates the voices of children because they&#039;re children. <br />
<br />
!!!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!<br />
<br />
I also think it&#039;s a wonderful pastiche of Beauty and the Beast. On the surface, we have a beauty, a beast, and a romantic dance scene, but all the nuances, situations, and feelings leading up to these moments entirely change the romantic nature of the source material to something more platonic and emotional. There&#039;s a second where it looks like Belle is going to kiss the Beast, but his reaction to her leaning in causes her to change her approach and it becomes a hug instead, and he visibly relaxes. It&#039;s got the visual elements of Beauty and the Beast but is infused with entirely different emotions and backstory, which was refreshing to see coming from an old fairy tale usage. This isn&#039;t a romance story despite the relation to Beauty and the Beast.<br />
<br />
!!!!!END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!!<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
Suzu and Kei are parallels to each other. The grief of losing a mother, the anger at overwhelming situations that cause them to lash out at the people around them, trying to do what they think is right, escaping to U and finding a way to cope with their feelings, and both becoming famous (infamous in Kei&#039;s case) are just some of the ways these two reflect the ways in which grief, anger, and sadness can affect a person in a traumatic situation. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT OVERALL<br />
This movie got me, in more ways than one, and I highly recommend you give it a chance. If nothing else, the music and visuals are great, and honestly it&#039;s like if Summer Wars and A Silent Voice had a baby, so if you liked either/both of those, you&#039;ll definitely find some enjoyment out of Belle.

    Okay, so first off, I absolutely ADORE this movie. The animation and music are so beautiful and well done. Unfortunately I can&#039;t say the same for the story. For the runtime to be 2 hours and for me to still have unanswered questions about the plot and the fate of key characters is a problem. Are they meant to be implied or not? Why can I fit my arm through these plotholes? To me, the story seems a bit lazy and dull compared to the quality of the rest of the movie. I can&#039;t say anything else without getting into spoilers but although the story

Belle was a disappointment in so many categories; you could tell by taking a glance through my scores that I am a &#039;big&#039; fan of Hosoda. Everything I have seen by him has at least looked nice and there are even shows I have specifically sought to watch because of him working as an episode director. Every film of his has this charm to it, the way the characters interact, the kagenashi artstyle, the pacing of scenes, he is just a fun director and I always look forward to what he has next. Watching the trailer for Belle there was a bit of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421175">
        apprehension to this one in particular. I do not mind CGI in anime when done well and as a fan of studio Orange&#039;s recent output CGI is clearly on the up in anime but the earlier trailers for Belle looked exceedingly jank. Hosoda has directed a few shorts in CGI that looked good so I was hoping the early trailers were more an early in production sort of roughness and not the final product. Even after watching the trailers I still had the mentality of &quot;well Hosoda has never made anything I&#039;ve thought was BAD so how bad could this one be?&quot;. By the end of it and by the score attached to the review you could probably guess I was shocked. <br />
 <br />
Belle bites off more than it can chew across the board, thematically and aesthetically. It starts out quite endearing as a sucker for loner characters in anime and the moodiness of scenes was refreshing for a Hosoda film but sadly none of this lasts. It is strange that his longest film somehow manages to feel the most undercooked thematically. If it were just a story of an anxious girl that has been through tragedy trying to find her voice again it could have been really strong but there were themes thrown in that I feel were too much for Hosoda to deal with (will not get into it because it is spoilers). By the time the credits rolled my friend and I just asked each other &quot;wait that was it??&quot; with extreme confusion. The resolutions are not satisfying at all and what was attempted is so heavy handed and cliche I could not believe it just ended on such a whimper. <br />
 <br />
Visually the film is a mess too. The CGI is so low quality and awkwardly polygonal it felt like an anime from the early 2010s but without the charm, at least back then you just kind of accept CGI as being awful. The backgrounds in the world of U are great however, which is a shame because everything else looked awful. Hosoda has made so many films with digital worlds (it is getting a bit tiring) but to my memory none of them were done in CG, the classic hosoda red outlines were used to denote the change of setting and it worked so much better. The beast was a particular eyesore, a jangly mess that never animates well, it is just so strange because Hosoda has done digital worlds well before and from a brief search apparently he had disney consultants working on this film&#039;s digital elements so how did it turn out so ugly? Hopefully this film is not setting a precedent for Hosoda to rely more on CG because one of the best elements of his films are the 2d art as well as his great direction of scenes.<br />
 <br />
Speaking of scenes, there was almost nothing memorable to me in this film at all. For a director I think other than Hosoda it might be a bit strange to have an entire paragraph about just cool scenes but I feel like that is Hosoda&#039;s strongest point (and honestly I do not think the excels as a writer), his films always leave you with a few stand out moments of brilliant direction and cinematography. The Digimon movie had the montage of people hacking computers, The girl who leapt through time, the titular girl leaping and running down the hill of course, Summer wars had the dinner scenes, wolf children had my favorites of the kids growing up through school as well as the snow scene... I could go on. I think Hosoda&#039;s strongest point is the way he can craft scenes that have such outstanding cinematography they stand out years after you have seen the film (I have not seen most of the films mentioned prior in at least 3 years) but Belle did not have any of that. I think this was not helped by the CG because so much of it looked ugly, there is this one montage scene that I think was meant to be THAT scene for the film but it was just so flat and boring and computerized I was kind of laughing during it. <br />
 <br />
It really is sad to give a filmmaker you like a bad score, Hosoda is not someone I thought could make a visually bland and narratively dry film the way Belle came out. The boy and the beast was not great either but it at least had a really strong first half. Belle is a film I will not remember in a few weeks, it was ugly and poorly written. It is a shame that the film does such a disservice to such heavy themes as well. I feel like certain people who have gone through the tragedies Belle dips its toe into and decides the water is too cold to actually tackle with nuance. I would be very insulted by it. I really hope this is not a trend for the worse with studio Chizu and Hosoda, Mirai was excellent so it is hard to say but I hope that he takes some time away for his next project to bake a lot longer because everything in Belle (especially the Beauty and the Beast laughably bad parallel) came out exceedingly raw. Oh, and it better not be 2 hours long too.<br />

    Just another aesthetic Anime Movie, with Disney/Frozen vibes.<br />
Like we saw on movie trailer, &quot;Belle&quot;&#039;s movie have such a wonderful art. The BG is stunning and the CG matches pretty well with the virtual world concept, same for the visual effects. We can notice a lot of rotoscoping in the animation too, but nothing exaggerated. So visually, is such a beautiful movie.<br />
But, about the story and development... It&#039;s simply, not catchy.<br />
There A LOT of roles and confuse scenes in this movie, we end wasting time wondering why &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; happened, and &quot;how&quot;... I think that a good story/plot doesn&#039;t make you wondering too much, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420706">
        simply make you entertained throughout the movie is rolling.<br />
Other point is about the characters: personally, I didn&#039;t empathize with any of them, just with Ryu. The reason why is, most of Ryu actions are available and we don&#039;t see this in Belle/Suzu, she&#039;s is really impulsive, what makes some scenes look forced, so we just can&#039;t empathize with her, she&#039;s is such annoying though.<br />
 Other thing catch me wondering, is that movie directed to a childish public? Cause I don&#039;t think the story would catch kids attention, but, the visuals of belle and songs would.<br />
Personally wouldn&#039;t watch this movie again, the art is stunning but the story simply don&#039;t shine.

    -a bit of spoiler i guess<br />
<br />
3/10. This is the first time i write a review. Just finished the movie and went straight here to rant about it. First of all, i love mamoru hosoda’s work. But this particular movie just aint it.<br />
<br />
Let’s get the good thing first. Best 3d animation I’ve seen in my life, best visuals, really good music.<br />
<br />
Now for the meat. Story is shit. What i get out of this movie is “let’s sing the abuse and trauma out”. Almost like making fun of abusive household situation. I said this from a person who got through all of that stuff. And seeing this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420280">
        movie makes my  blood boils a bit. It feels like i got slapped with a shovel in the face and got spit on in the mouth.<br />
<br />
Now i know and do realize this is a damn anime. Im not a neckbeard who shit on  anime that’s unrealistic. And i don’t usually give a show a bad rating. But come on, we talking about heavy topics here. At least It would be fine if the movie explores other part of the world instead of going for this “we (literally suddenly) need to find this beast who actually an abused kid and save him”. Like focus on the story of the main character or something. Mc’s trauma just went poof out of the window.<br />
<br />
Now, if you enjoy it that’s great. I can see why people would like this movie. If you like disney movies you’ll definitely love this one. I just personally can’t stand the writing.
