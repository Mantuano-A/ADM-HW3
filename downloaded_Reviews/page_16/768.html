    Watching Golden Kamuy made me realize how amazing a series is when it’s anchored so firmly to the concepts of war and survival. Even though it has an archaic feel, this anime convinced me that there’s hope for more great historical fiction tales. I say this honestly as someone who isn’t a big fan of historical fiction. On my first viewing, it was incredibly easily to dive into the show as we meet Sugimoto, a survivor of the Russo-Japanese war. It shouldn’t take long for fans to realize what they’re in stored for and I’m talking about a story that is much deeper than war

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282165">
        or survival itself. <br />
<br />
Based on the adaptation of the same name, Golden Kamuy takes on shape from the creator’s mind to bring a war survivor adventure into anime medium. While the show takes place in the aftermath of a war, there’s still clear conflicts that are unsolved in their present world. The first episode indulges on how Sugimoto earned his nickname, Sugimoto the Immortal. His encounter with Asirpa, an Ainu girl who saves his life almost seems like fate. Despite their differences, it really shouldn’t take long for viewers to realize their eyecatchy character chemistry. Our main protagonists are on this adventure and their skills supplements each other. Sugimoto’s military skills as an ex-soldier is invaluable for fighting the enemies that they encounter. Meanwhile, Ainu is a survivalist and possesses many important skills such as hunting, cooking, and taming animals. The two become partners in search for treasure but many obstacles stand in their way. A show like this doesn’t need a complicated storyteller because how straightforward it can be.<br />
<br />
Now you’re probably wondering if the series will feel more like a cat and mouse game with such a premise. The idea of hunters being hunted is a classic concept that have been used over and over. What Golden Kamuy does different is able to take great care of its characters. I’m actually flabbergasted at how much the show made me invest into learning more about Sugimoto and Asirpa. From a cultural standpoint, the show explores the Ainu people as an indigenous ethnic group. We learn about their lifestyle, family ancestry, traditions, language, and behavior. This translates to how well Asirpa&#039;s character can be accepted as we learn more about her. She preaches the lifestyle of Ainu and has great respect for nature. Through her experience, Asirpa has learned how to tame certain animals, hunt, and cook for herself and family. On the other hand, Sugimoto makes an oddball impression to me at first because how violent he seems. While he’s not a bloodthirsty man, Sugimoto can be very ruthless when confronting his enemies. War has really affected him and he became the present man as we know now. The brief PTSD moments that we witness in the series shows how guilty he feels about losing important people in his life. Thus, Sugimoto is always determined to survive and protect those he cares of. Thanks to his military experience as an ex-soldier, he does a damn good at job at that.<br />
<br />
Led by Lieutenant Tsurumi, the 7th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army stands as a main obstacle of Sugimoto and Asirpa in their quest to find treasure. While not everyone in the division shares the same goal, they do treat the duo as a threat. It becomes a suspenseful plot as viewers will likely wonder how far they these characters go to accomplish their goals. Make no mistake. This anime doesn’t tease death and often portrays it in a realistic manner. Beyond just the PTSD moments we see from Sugimoto’s point of view, there are also times when characters question about killing others. A prominent example is how Tanigaki deals with the people he’s killed. Similar to Sugimoto, it’s clear that he feels guilty and that his sins will live with him forever. Like most war stories, death is a reality and what’s dead stays dead. War has broken characters and it’s not uncommon to realize how much people can change from the past to their present selves.<br />
<br />
Even though everything I mentioned so far in the review suggests a moody show to get tissues for, it really isn’t. The series offers creative comedy mostly thanks to the character cast. If I’ve said it once, I’ve say it a hundred times. Never look away from Sugimoto and Asirpa when they interact with each other. The two often trades in small talk that blends between their different cultural beliefs. The jokes they throw at each other are hilarious and sells its comedic factors perfectly. Refreshing comedy isn’t easy to create but Golden Kamuy hits the right mark especially with the character reactions. I lost count how many times this show made me laugh positively to the character interactions and humorous dialogues. Characters such as Yoshitake Shirashi adds in even more comedy gags such as being a magnet head for animal bites. That is to say, Golden Kamuy is a serious show that deals with sensitive themes but also finds its way to have fun. To me, that’s important and valuable to sell itself.<br />
<br />
I’m pretty sure most people aren’t familiar with Gene Studio. That’s because it’s a new studio that only recently began to produce projects such as Kokkoku and Gyakusatus Kikan. Early impressions of the show may have people pointing fingers at the atrocious CGI usage such as the poorly animated bear. Luckily, the visual quality manages to redeem itself as each episode begins to improve itself through its natural elegance. The landscapes of show looks gorgeous and larger than life. From snowy mountains to dense forests, it’s how nature should look like with its lush backgrounds. Even the food looks real that’s crafted right from the wilderness with survivalist skills. Character designs also offer distinctive features such as the military uniforms of the 7th Division. Sugimoto is a man that’s hard to overlook with his soldier uniform and masculinity. Asirpa may have a petite look but she’s noticeable for her blue and greenish eyes. Some characters even addresses this like a gem that’s hard to ignore. The Ainu coat she wears also shows her cultural style of clothing with the deerskin boats to protect her from the cold. She looks like a hunter that shouldn’t be underestimated. As a new studio, I would say that Gene Studio made an interesting impression. I’m not overwhelmed or disappointed by the production quality as it manages to capture the elements of the battle scenes and is faithful to the character designs. However, it does fall short occasionally on capturing the full vivid details of the manga.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack and music overall creates the sensation of a survivalist show. The OP song contains electric beats and montages of characters in action. Meanwhile, the character voices really does sell their personalities. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at intimidating of a man Tsurumi really can be. <br />
<br />
Golden Kamuy is a historical fiction that can be a bit deceptive once you really get a bite of the show. Director Hitoshi Nanba took the important concepts of the manga and gave this adaptation a breath of life. As someone who has read the manga, I definitely recommend giving it a try if you’re hungry for more. It previously won the 9th Manga Taishou award and rightfully earned so. As an anime series, Golden Kamuy is also a show that’s fortunate to receive a golden treatment.

    Just because the setting isn&#039;t highschool doesn&#039;t make the anime automatically good.<br />
Golden Kamuy is a combination of a National Geographic/History channel program about the Ainu and rush for gold.<br />
<br />
Before the Spring2018 began, I had gone over the trailers of the shows to air this season.<br />
Golden Kamuy presented a nice cast of voice actors I like, an era around 1900, guns, wolves and rush for gold.<br />
Sounds like a pretty solid action anime.<br />
<br />
Now, I can&#039;t deny that Golden Kamuy had some sweet action, but unfortunately, both the action and the story took a backseat to the &quot;Ainu culture&quot;.<br />
I don&#039;t know, after watching most of the show, people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282179">
        came and said &quot;The action wasn&#039;t the point of the show, but the point was to show the Ainu culture&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well, I can say for sure that the trailer made it look a lot better than it is in reality. If they showed the &quot;Ainu culture&quot; mostly in the trailer instead of the action and thrill, I doubt it would&#039;ve attracted as many people.<br />
<br />
So, what exactly is shown that I found tedious and boring?<br />
For the first half of the show (and even a bit later), ~7 minutes every episode were about the Ainu Cooking. Take Shokugeki no Souma, remove the Ecchi, remove the competition, remove the Shounen aspects.<br />
We&#039;re left with 7 minutes out of ~20 every week of &quot;Oh this broth is so good, the squirrel meat isn&#039;t heavy and the chopped bones make it crunchy&quot; etc. etc. etc. Then also don&#039;t forget to put &quot;Hinna Hinna&quot; afterwards.<br />
<br />
Then, the hunting, and of course explanation how everything works.<br />
&quot;This trap is a barrel with a few nails in it. The foxes come to lick the bottom of the barrel and then get stuck. We hit them with a stick to finish them off&quot;<br />
&quot;It is said that fox pelt is bad luck, [...] you can sell fox pelt for 1 yen, and these animals&#039; pelts for 1 yen too, and this for 3 yen...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, but it was just not interesting.<br />
<br />
The real plot of the gold rush, along with a few groups all trying to get the big gold prize is.... pretty damn good.<br />
It features a few groups, some are military veterans from the Russo-Japanese war, some are even older but all of them... are interesting. And are voiced by great voice actors.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame that the real plot kicks in only around episode 10, and even then it still has the &quot;filler&quot; stuff like before.<br />
For example all of episode 12 was about horse racing, and how the Ainu use fortune telling. We got only 3 minutes maximum of continuation for the clash between the groups after the gold.<br />
<br />
The art didn&#039;t do justice as well. The controversial &quot;CGI Bears&quot; as well as the &quot;CGI fire&quot; and other CGI stuff just didn&#039;t fit well.<br />
I understand the staff wanted to make it look special (If I remember correctly, what&#039;s what they said why they made CGI bears) but it just doesn&#039;t look good.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to commend to Golden Kamuy, it would&#039;ve been the OP/ED. MAN WITH A MISSION and THE SIXTH SENSE did absolutely an amazing job.<br />
<br />
Overall, was Golden Kamuy good? So-so, it depends what you&#039;re expecting and what you want to watch. And also, a second season was announced so there&#039;s a chance it&#039;ll cover the failures or at least continue the story in S1, and not show us almost a full episode about kids playing with a stick.<br />
<br />

    At the time of this review, the series has been greenlit for Season 2 this Fall, and I could not be more than happy for a continuation of the series! But what all the hoopla, what is this series actually about?<br />
<br />
Golden Kamuy (in Ainu language: Golden Gods) is more than just the typical action-adventure anime like so many others out there. It&#039;s fun, great and enjoyable for many reasons, to the point where it’s proof that we want at least a 2nd (to 3rd if possible) season to continue the series (if possible).<br />
<br />
The story goes of the 20th century Russo-Japanese war, centered in the city

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282172">
        of harsh-northern-filled-wilderness Hokkaido, where we got to know and learn the most fearsome yet determinant of the series: the male MC Saichi “Immortal” Sugimoto, a veteran soldier who has fought in the war and miraculously survived after the deadly ordeal. It was there that he is promised to upkeep with his now-dead comrade (Toraji) from a dubious story of a large chunk of hidden Ainu gold (that’s worth about 800 mil yen), and the main goal to steal it and finance his widow (Umeko) for years to come.<br />
<br />
The problem? It was stolen by a man called Nopperabo during transportation, and knowing his near-arrival death, so once captured and imprisoned, he carved out a map on 24 of the fellow imprisoned inmates on the location of the gold. And now, with that info, Immortal Sugimoto is set on the journey to find the gold.<br />
<br />
Alas, not everything is well as there are other groups and individuals who are eyeing on the same gold as Sugimoto does: The Imperial Japanese Army’s 7th Division, led by Lieutenant Tsurumi for use on military dictatorship to run an independent Hokkaido that’s separated from Japan; a group formed by former samurai Toshizou Hijikata, who escaped alongside the tattooed 24 inmates to steal the gold to fund Hokkaido and its loss from the Russo-Japanese war, and some others who are just stealing for themselves.<br />
<br />
In the wilderness, Sugimoto comes across the wild bears of the wilderness, and seeing that survival is in the eyes of the beholder, it looks as if he will be taken down by the bear. And so, enter Asirpa, an Ainu girl who knows the way of the Hokkaido wilderness, and her ulterior motive: to avenge her father’s death, because of his involvement of the transportation of Ainu gold that Nopperabo had successfully stolen in the first place (but not the main culprit who murdered her father). With that, with the intentions of Sugimoto and Asirpa, both set their journeys into a common place with different goals in mind.<br />
<br />
Fun fact: Lo and behold, as much as a native Ainu she is, she does have a Japanese name (Asuko Kochoube) that reveals the plot even further, and one step closer to knowing the real murderer and her roots. Will this be explained, let&#039;s hope for Season 2 to explain what&#039;s left!<br />
<br />
As much as the story setting and its storytelling is pretty much a perfect 1-to-1 adaptation from the manga source, I personally think that everything here is consistent, matches what the manga sprinkles on its historical context, and the icing on the cake is the native Ainu dialect (that’s exclusive to Hokkaido), supervised by the same guy who did the manga translation (Hiroshi Nakagawa), and it’s a great job learning and watching the show in its entirety.<br />
<br />
The characters here are also what made the series more enjoyable to tackle and journey with. On the good side, we have Immortal Sugimoto, the courageous yet unstoppable man of valor, Asirpa the lone Ainu girl, but is just as fearless and is able to interpret her surroundings well, the Escape King Yoshitake Shiraishi, who&#039;s able to escape from just about any level of danger, which forms the good team to get the gold for justice.<br />
However, the enemies are just as brutal, from the relentless Lieutenant Tsurumi, whom by his half-android-like face shows no qualms of authority, and his motto is to snatch the opportunity in whatever ways possible. Hijikata Toshizou is no brute either, whilst looking for the Ainu gold, he is manipulating behind the scenes in some forms and ways that like Tsurumi, is firm and no questions asked.<br />
<br />
The art and animation by Geno Studio is once again, great, inspirational and a visual treat. Their previous work (Kokkoku) is a testament to this anime, and the once-founded studio to take over the defunct Manglobe is now becoming a reality to look out for quality content. With that said, it wouldn&#039;t be true if the series was all good. The elephant in the series is with the CGI-laden wild bears, and it&#039;s quite apparent that it didn’t mesh well with the background visuals, not to mention that it&#039;s outrageously visible. Everything else on the side is truly well done, a big shout out to the people handling the facial expressions of the characters (during the characters’ meal times, shouting “hinna hinna!”), it&#039;s just so uncanny and comical, it always gives off much laughter each and every time.<br />

The music is phenomenal, and one of the best OSTs you could have this season. All reputable music artists in play with their new songs (MWAM’s “Winding Road” for the OP and THE SIXTH LIE’s “Hibana” for the ED), I still stand by my testimony from my prelim and say that in terms of musicality, it&#039;s one that’s worthy of listening to on it&#039;s own and evokes the emotions of the characters, and is the best representation of the series as a whole.<br />
<br />
In the end, you might be wondering, is the anime better or as well adapted as its acclaimed manga counterpart? From an overall standpoint, the anime adaptation replicates as much from the manga as possible, but due to it being a 1-cour, the historical context is downplayed significantly, and not to mention that the anime adaptation sometimes doesn’t give off the same vibes as how well the manga did. Had this been a 2-cour (24-26 episodes), we would have appreciated much more, but I&#039;ll give props for what was presented here generally, and I would say that both are even as much as manga adaptation goes. <br />
<br />
With that said, Golden Kamuy is definitely one of the better and premier shows of this season and it&#039;s comes recommended if you want a slice of history that’s not too heavy, and more so on the diversity of the culture behind it all.

    OREWA FUJIMI NO SUGIMOTO DAAAA !<br />
<br />
What a blast this anime is ! I was part of the people who had doubts and difficulties to begin this anime because it looks like a niche anime if you watch the small number of people watching and rating it, but what a blast it is !<br />
<br />
Story 10 : At the beginning, you need to watch 4 to 5 episodes to really get hooked on this anime, it is the time necessary to properly set up the gold hunt which is the main plot line of the series. Indeed, Golden Kamuy doesn&#039;t waste time in hooking people up from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416137">
        the beginning which is a main thing happening in more popular/mainstream anime, but it focus on it&#039;s roots, building a great worldview so the story can properly evolve.<br />
<br />
The story is about a gold hunt happening in old Japan when Japan was in war with Russia, it focus on several groups hunting the gold hidden by an infamous criminal. <br />
<br />
Art 10 : The art is great for this anime, it fits a military/war story perfectly. The change in the art depending on the situation is also great, it makes you laugh when there is comedy (and there is a lot in this anime) but also makes you shiver when the situation turns bloody (and there is also a lot of situation like that as well :p)<br />
<br />
Sound 10 : The sound management is great, the OSTs are beautiful and Golden Kamuy makes a great job of the timing of those OSTs. There are a lot of situation where there are no sounds at all and I think it&#039;s a great addition to those situations, when other anime for example would put a thriller/scary ost. Sometimes, it&#039;s better to cut all background sounds to focus on the characters, and Golden Kamuy makes a great job for that.<br />
<br />
Character 10 : The characters are amazing. The MC is really one of the greatest MCs I watched in anime and I watched A LOT of anime. Sugimoto is a military that went to war, and the author makes a great job of showing his personality conflict. Between a man who is still lost in his fightings and killings and the other part who wants to find his oldself again and turn the page. <br />
The main heroin, Asirpa, is also greatly written. Asirpa is still a child evolving in this world and the author makes great use of the story of her people, the Ainu (who are taking a huge part of the plot) to build Asirpa. Her habits, her way of living, but also her will to grow as her own person, and be herself despite of such a heritage. <br />
<br />
Then we have other characters like Shiraishi, Ogata, Tanigaki or Tsurumi. They are all greatly written to be honest, each possessing their own personalities and goals. It&#039;s stupid but just the fact that I can remember those names without any research despite of them being side characters says a lot about the writing of the author when there are some animes where it&#039;s difficult to remember the MC&#039;s name.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall :<br />
<br />
Similar to the main plot of the story, Golden Kamuy is simply a gold hunt. You need to dig a little bit in the series and watch the first episodes and you will simply find a golden treasure.

    Golden Kamuy tells an action-packed treasure hunting story, it deftly weaves in an unflinching portrayal of Ainu culture. The in-depth detail that the culture is shown in is likely thanks to the Ainu consultant on the production staff, ensuring the greatest accuracy possible. Moreover, this series never shies away from discussing the ugly way Japan treated the Ainu in the past either, in turn making the story more realistic and believable. <br />
<br />
The story follows Saichi “The Immortal” Sugimoto, a gruff survivor of the Russo-Japanese war. Famous for violently slaughtering his foes to escape from dozens of life-threatening combat situations; as we see in many thrilling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282185">
        action sequences he’ll never be content with death, motivated by his unfinished business. Panning for gold during winter in Hokkaido’s wilderness is how he spends his time nowadays, desperate for money to keep a promise he made to his friend who died during the war. Lucky for him, he hears of a wild tale about a man who murdered a group of Ainu men, stole hundreds of pounds of gold, hid it in Hokkaido before his arrest, then tattooed a treasure map onto the bodies of his fellow prisoners. <br />
<br />
In the opening episode, Sugimoto fights for a prisoner’s tattooed body with a bear who wants to make them both its next meal. Through a lucky encounter, he’s saved by a skilled Ainu hunter, a young girl named Asirpa. He confides the tale of hidden treasure in Asirpa, and together they begin their journey in search of it. As the story progresses it takes on a ‘prisoner of the week’ structure, but through constantly adding new characters the series avoids feeling formulaic. The prisoners have their own weird dispositions and stories of their own, gradually forming the greater narrative of what this treasure is all about. Despite its premise, Golden Kamuy’s plot structure flows in a surprisingly natural way. Sometimes an episode may revolve around the duo escaping authorities who are after the treasure as well. A handful of sadistic villains add a constant sense of danger even when they’re not locked in combat with a prisoner. Then there’s the prisoner Shiraishi, a foolhardy escape artist, who joins the lead duo on their journey. This liberated form of writing makes every episode feel like you&#039;re getting something new, despite it occasionally causing the pacing to meander on certain parts rather than consistently developing the story. <br />
<br />
At first, Sugimoto and Asirpa’s relationship is an uneasy alliance, he needs her help to find the gold and she needs his help to find the man who murdered her father. Despite this beginning, they become friends and genuinely care about one another. Sugimoto sees firsthand how awfully people treat Ainu people by being around Asirpa, and he stands up for when he can because she accepts it being used to the racism. Fantastic commentary and discussion on the Ainu culture are deftly woven into their satisfying character arcs, never sounding preachy and somehow always excitingly presenting historical facts. Seeing them hunt with one another using Asirpa’s Ainu techniques is awesome; she teaches Sugimoto them as well and it brings plenty of chemistry but also strengthens their bond. The hunting methods she uses are always quite clever and lend themselves excellently to action scenes. Like Asirpa may teach Sugimoto and the viewer how to make squirrel traps to foreshadow its use later during a higher stakes combat scene. This is how you write an action scene! We’re presented with clever ideas then they return later on to be used in creative ways, a satisfying outcome for any viewer keeping track of the Ainu lessons. Rewarding payoffs like this make Golden Kamuy such an enjoyable experience. <br />
<br />
The show well to avoid framing Sugimoto as better than Asirpa’s at the Ainu techniques that she taught him. Many stories land in this pitfall while trying to portray indigenous tribes, having the foreigner beat them at their own game not realizing how condescending that framing could be seen by the natives. Thankfully this does not happen in Golden Kamuy because it is intelligently and respectfully written.<br />
<br />
Weighing down Golden Kamuy&#039;s adaptation the most is the mediocre visuals that fail to elevate the strong writing beyond the manga. It&#039;s clear the newly opened Geno Studio tried their best, but picking an action series to work on may have been out of their full capabilities. Backgrounds are messy and flat, character animation is passable but oversimplifies the manga’s great designs, and that hideous CGI bear looks like something out of a PS1 game. However, the opening &quot;Winding Road&quot; by Man With a Mission is fantastic, well-edited, and intensely performed, it&#039;s well suited to a survival series like this one. The ending theme &quot;Hibana&quot; is also one of the best of the season, a great alternative rock that showcases detailed art from the manga.<br />
<br />
Even with all of the high points Golden Kamuy has, I would consider the pitch-perfect tone to be its biggest strength. The show blends comedy with the gritty premise, the tone is balanced amazingly. Noboru Takagi, the guy who adapted Baccano also adapted this series’ already great source material, which is likely why the dialogue is so snappy and never feels slow or lacking. And this writing is only elevated by the fantastic voice acting; Asirpa’s seriousness played to comedic effect, Shiraishi’s goofy disregard for danger, Sugimoto’s fierceness in action sequences, it’s all excellent. The banter between Asirpa and Sugimoto is wonderfully lighthearted too, some of their expressions are hilariously exaggerated too. The action scenes are typically over-the-top with gore because of the wild personalities of all the characters, there is a scene with Sugimoto punching a bear! None of the violence feels like it&#039;s there for shock value either; they are in a survival situation, after all. Their lives are constantly in danger from enemies and their hunting for food is shown in visceral but realistic detail.<br />
The tone is further balanced by the wonderful detail put into describing the food the group eats, using Ainu’s strangely delicious-looking recipes to showcase their culture. While there’s a fair share of dramatic scenes, the show always maintains its wry charm thanks to the characters. Regardless of how absurdly dangerous their survival situation might be. <br />
<br />
Regardless of Golden Kamuy’s production flaws, its writing is way too good to not recommend. I would also recommend seeking out the manga as well if you want to see the series art at a higher quality. With a second season coming in the Fall Season, we can only hope it is produced by someone other than Geno Studio. Nevertheless, Golden Kamuy is an insightful and worthwhile adventure that manages to thrill with compelling action and endear with its fantastic characters in equal parts.

    Story: 10<br />
The main story looks so promising for me. They were using the historical value as their basic to expand the adventurous vibes in a nice way. That was some brilliant moves, and i just love this kind of decision, and so far. The studio did a very nice way to keep the pacing intacted in the right direction, and i believed they were did a very well done adaptation so far. So, yeah, its more point for the show! The setting was simply amazing. I just can&#039;t believed this series had a nice setup on the past timeline. Its looked incredible and more importantly,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356444">
        the historical value that much happening in the Hokkaido past, especially with Ainu tribe that still exist on that era, just so nice to be watched. Its great, i just love how its explained more of Ainu tribe&#039;s culture, their language, their habit, and such, a nice additional score went by to that point. What a great lesson i had by watching this series. The story telling on these episode had me to highlight it too. Its just interesting, and the narrator did a great job explaining some line that really help building the vibe for the current arc. Its really help me a lot. The plot just another my favourite. Its so fluent with everything that happened. First, it might looks like an after war problem. But its ended up with a hunting theme, by taking a little adventurous. However its turned around again by learning a new knowledge for me, yes its Ainu tribe, by announcing the girl. And then, finally i got a big picture about what was goin on. Its not just your usual adventure and a normal hunting time. Its just more than that, with an eccentric characters as a great addition, and multiple variable of its plot to advancing. A lot od complexity, made me realized that these series just way bigger than i could anticipated. Its very appreciated. 10 points for this Introduction. <br />
<br />
Art, Animation in general: 8<br />
I might be not so good to reviewing this kind of aspects. But i must be honest that the art and animation sometimes, were not so appealing. Sometimes its missed to be united in a good animation, while the others had a static animation. The crappy art style sometimes emerge to the surface created a big questions to me, while the direction at the end somehow used some weird cut. But its fine to me, otherwise, the transition over their ending theme song just well matched up. So, i should take it easy knewing the storyline was just so amazing. So, at general, its not so problem for me. Sometime its surely not went smoothly. I just take it as a comedy aspect for the show to advancing more eccentrism that began to be this series strength. Its real, how weird Asirpa looks when she comically referred miso as shit, but its turned to be a funny thing, and almost happening while Shiraishi or Sugimoto did a derp face for the sake of humour. Its suited well for me, and i can&#039;t take it as their mistake. Its just a designated art, and animation. Its just their style to posessed a relatable expression while its needed. So, i take it at as my personal satisfaction. So, no joke, its 8 for me. <br />
<br />
Sounds effect, soundtrack, OP ED theme sections: 9<br />
The sounds effect felt nice, especially with the nature and animal sounds, its fine by me. The battle cry ambience of effect was their best, especially with their battle or action involved sounds, its greatThe VA did a great job too, while voicing all of that amazing character pretty fluent. I just love their OP and ED quite well done, and its so catchy on my hearing too. Overall, i just not taking such a long phrase on these one. Its great for me. So thats it all. <br />
<br />
Characterization: 10<br />
I may be sounds too biased. Bcause its just my personal compliment. So, here i am took this section as short as possible. While sometimes Sugimoto might looks like your typical shounen MC show with its determination could get rid everything with his shouts only. The moment to built up his characters just amazing. Its started with something in generic, obviously. A war, that place him to be an immortal people. However, its not stopped into like that. Since his coincidence meeting with a chibi girl from Ainu tribe, his way of life suddenly changed. This is the beauty of his characterization, the relations between them held some good moments, and its just so soothing to be watched. At the end, its just served into a nice little connections that brought back more curiosity to see how they were finished the beautiful relations. Its not ended up with those two. The side character had so many perfect characterization. I even thought that the series span the side character more than the main twos. Lol. However, its just felt nice as the result. The main twos were not losing their shines, and its connected well with the plot story. How could i said a big complain when all of them just looks so great? From the hunter, the King of Escape, the leader of a military forces, the individual soldier of him, the old samurai man, the citizen, the villager of Ainu tribe, the prisoner, they had all the perfect characterization needed to be added on the long duration series. Golden Kamuy already showed to me how well it could handle such a thing. A great characterization with their own eccentricsm. Its lived, its made the series felt interesting and so entertaining.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, plus my overall scores: 10.<br />
This is my personal enjoyment as an anime watcher only. 12 episodes were not enough to fully capacitating my own satisfaction. So, a 10 for this Introduction for the long series of their adventure felt so logic with their eccentricsm, a unique story, and so diversed characters with their rich in many personalities.<br />
<br />
Thats it for me.

    I&#039;m not going to review each season individually just because MAL insists on listing them on different pages. This review will be on the series as a whole, not just season 1. I also won&#039;t make this review too long because I hate absurdly long, convoluted reviews.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
This story was masterfully crafted. Not only is the premise quite note worthy for being intriguing and even somewhat mysterious (with the identity of Noppera-bou being a mystery and a huge portion of the driving of the plot is based on that fact), the adventure Sugimoto and Asirpa embark on together is one with exctiting action, engaging side

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367427">
        characters/antagonists, audacious humour, compelling backstories and a nice amount of Ainu culture exposure along with Japanese and Russian history. These reasons alone should tell anyone who might be on the fence about watching this anime that they have certainly stumbled upon one that is worth watching.<br />
<br />
Art:8/10<br />
<br />
The art is very good. I like the colour scheme and the care in details.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is great! I love it!<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
These characters are some of the most unique and interesting characters I have ever seen in an anime. Some of my favourites being Lt. Tsurumi, Toshizou, Ogata and Tanigaki. And the best part about this is that instead of trying too hard to make the characters out to be more than they are, the story allows them to shine in the best way possible. (I hope you can understand what I mean)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
This anime is in my Top 10. I freaking LOVE it! The story is so captivating that I find myself not wanting to turn it off even to sleep or do something else. It&#039;s so much fun to watch!

    Golden Kamuy is that rarest of things among anime: a pleasant surprise. It combines elements of action, slice of life, and military anime into a period historical drama that is both harrowingly tense and a whole bunch of fun. For the characters and action alone this show is worth watching, but the small window it gives us into the history and culture of the Ainu people makes this show a must-watch.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
In the frigid northern reaches of Hokkaido we meet Saichi Sugimoto, a legendary veteran of the recent (1904-05) Russo-Japanese war who is said to be nearly immortal. It is good that he is apparently immortal,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279530">
        because pretty soon everybody and everything starts trying to kill him. Sugimoto has decided to search for a hidden cache of stolen Ainu gold, which does indeed seem like a really good idea. The problem is that a bunch of other veterans have had the same really good idea, and let us just say that they do not much appreciate the competition. A shocking amount of violence ensues.  I may or may not have failed to mention that the location of the treasure is tattooed on the backs of 24 escaped convicts, and that the convicts do not take to kindly to being hunted down and skinned...<br />
<br />
Sugimoto soon realizes that the harsh wilderness of Hokkaido will be an even bigger problem that the army of unpleasant people trying to shoot and hit him with things, but a deus ex machina in the form of a young Ainu woman named Asirpa appears and takes an interest in Sugimoto&#039;s hunt for the gold that was stolen from her people. Asirpa is an experienced survivalist whose competence and wealth of knowledge perfectly compliments Sugimoto&#039;s terrifying hardiness and physical prowess. Together they set out to take the stolen Ainu gold for themselves. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound:<br />
Both good, neither amazing. It looks perfectly clean and is very well animated, and it also definitely feels cold. They did a good job of conveying the harshness of the winter. The voice work is also great. A special shout out goes to the Ainu language that we get to hear. Apparently they hired an Ainu Linguist to make sure it was legit, and that kind of attention to detail is super impressive IMO. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Awesome.<br />
Sugimoto is relateable, complicated, and most of all a total badass. Asirpa is strong, endearing, and just as capable as Sugimoto at putting up a fight. Together they are a perfect team, and they seem to know it. They are pretty clearly interested in each other, and because I like them both I totally want them to get together. I can&#039;t wait to see what happens with them. I suspect it will be tragic because the show is kind of like that, but if it is it will be super fuckin tragic and full of feels and I&#039;ll probably cry. So that&#039;s cool too.<br />
<br />
My favorite part so far has been getting to meet the Ainu characters and see them cook, worship, hunt, and live their lives. It feels like whoever wrote this really cared about showing aspects of the Ainu culture in a way that is both educational and fun to watch. There has been as much food porn as a really slow episode of Shokugeki no Souma, so that&#039;s awesome too. <br />
<br />
The majority of the rest of the characters are either tattooed cons or hardened and borderline unhinged veterans of the 7th division of the Imperial Japanese Army. Anybody who survived the war and the harsh conditions of Hokkaido has got be one grizzled bastard, and they do not disappoint. Special shout to their commander who is especially grizzled and especially a bastard. He&#039;s the guy with the scary face. You&#039;ll know who I mean when you see it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I am absolutely loving this show so far, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I suppose it contains too much violence for a young kid (although I totally would&#039;ve loved it as a kid just sayin) but otherwise anybody who wants to have a pretty kick-ass time and learn some stuff about the history and culture of Japan at the same time should watch this show. <br />
<br />
WATCH GOLDEN KAMUY YOU GUYS IT&#039;S REALLY GOOOOOOOD!!!!!

    If netflix or a major anime viewing platform like Adult Swim or Toonami ever picked this up it would BLOW UP!!! Fans of shows like Rurouni Kenshin or Full Metal Alchemist will totally love this show. The protagonist bring back old classic hero tropes in a unique feeling. They are powerful and you know, the leads of the show, but they also feel very defeat able. No godlike powers just strong performances and strong wills to survive what the story throws at them.<br />
<br />
Animal lovers beware though this show is not shy about hunting. It&#039;s the main way they survive and &quot;the brains are usually tasty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317570">
        with a little salt&quot; and they dont let the eyeballs go to waste either.<br />
<br />
Plays out superbly and each of the characters have their own unique feel in a show that could have made them very bland. Voice acting is great too. I recommend you watch it dubbed if you can.<br />
<br />
If your looking for a show without magic powers and realistic feel this is the anime for you.

    Apart from the 3D CGI animals this anime is pretty well done they follow the manga and the facial expressions was pretty well done and the colours in this show was outstanding, I also have to give credit to the opening and ending but mainly the ending because the visuals during the ending was brilliant and the ending track was awesome as well 👌 I gotta say among the shows that was airing at the same time this seires was the most enjoyable to watch every week I did feel a bit sorry for the animals that they killed and ate tho R I.P but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286608">
        besides that this series was awesome I can&#039;t wait for season 2, the Japanese voice actors for this series was good especially hijikata loved him everytime he spoke

    Golden Kamuy looks like yet another seinen which anime adaptation aims to destroy everything its source material accomplished. These were my expectations anyway, but I was wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
The writing is a bit lacking with its &quot;pray and spray&quot; war tactics and telepoting buddies who save the day on last possible second, but the atmosphere quickly makes up for this. In the first 5 minutes of episode 01, we get a scene where drunken man sits on a snowy river bank, gazing into nothingness while the heat from his campfire seems to be his only comfort. This scene is perfect. It gives us understanding of the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279408">
        universe and shows us with what type of mindset the series should be approaced with. Not to mention that the animated fire itself is glorious as hell. Almost like from triple A video game. Golden Kamuy doesn&#039;t take its time, it directly goes into business by explaining what it is all about. Something which most seinen anime adaptations and shows from current season in generally have failed to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
From its production, Golden Kamuy has clearly learned from others&#039; mistakes. I was afraid this would suffer from the downgrade effect we have seen in the past with series such as Blade of the Immortal, Hellsing and Shin Angyo Onshi. On the other hand, I was afraid the overall feel of the series would be destroyed with CGI/art directing like Kingdom did with its S01, or Drifters or *shivers* Berserk with its newer adaptations. Reality is the opposite. This gives us hope that maybe Wit Studios won&#039;t make Vinland Saga unwatchable after all. Smarter choices. Golden Kamuy art and animation perfectly represent the series. I am genuinely surprised. <br />
<br />
<br />
The story and characters were never the strongest part of this series, and the production team seems to be well aware of this. It plays with tensions, build-up and audiovisual execution exactly as it should. On top of that, every new episode has been better than the last. I highly recommend this series especially to manga readers who have already given up hope on the lesser medium. The fans of &#039;Seirei no Moribito&#039; and &#039;Blade of the Immortal&#039; should check this out ASAP as well.

    Golden Kamuy is an anime from just last year. It&#039;s based off a Noda Satoru manga that&#039;s been going since 2014 and the anime was handled by Geno studio. No relation to a certain marionette with a gun arm. So, I don&#039;t know anything about either the writer or studio. Let&#039;s dive right into the series. We&#039;ll just be looking at series one today. I might look at the second another time. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story is set shortly after the Russo-Japanese war. Our hero, &quot;Immortal&quot; Sugimoto fought in the war as a soldier and always managed to survive in spite of being put into many deadly situations. Since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306528">
        the war ended, he&#039;s panning for gold to try to help an old friend&#039;s widow. He&#039;s listening to a drunken idiot who tells him the story of a bunch of escaped convicts with tattoos leading to a great treasure. At first, he doesn&#039;t believe it but then the drunkard sobers up enough to really regret telling the story and Sugimoto discovers that he is, in fact, one of the tattooed convicts. Sugimoto quickly ends up pairing with a young Ainu hunter named Asirpa in order to find the treasure before the other groups hunting for it do. <br />
<br />
The only glaring narrative problem with this series is that it can be overly slow at times. There are a lot of scenes with Asirpa just explaining hunting techniques or outdoors survival information to Sugimoto and they don&#039;t do much for the major narrative. They&#039;re just kind of dragged out, boring segments. You could cut out the bulk of these scenes and really lose nothing. It&#039;s like Noda did a lot of research into the Ainu, how they lived and hunted and really wanted everyone to know. <br />
<br />
To the series&#039; credit, the concept is a strong one. Having two major groups and a small one all looking for the same treasure with their own motivations to do so makes for a good, dynamic conflict. And even if the hunting scenes do go on too long, I do appreciate the details about Ainu life and culture. They give the series a strong grounding. The series also does a decent job of balancing the more serious aspects of the story with some more comedic elements. Although the joke of Asirpa thinking that miso is faeces does get old pretty quickly. The series also does end at a good point. There&#039;s enough intrigue to get you interested in the second series and enough content that you don&#039;t feel cheated. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The series does a good job of developing its major characters, Sugimoto &amp; Asirpa. It also does a good job with certain side characters, most notably Tanigaki. I&#039;ll also credit it with fleshing out the differing motivations for wanting the treasure pretty clearly. That being said, a lot of the convicts they encounter are pretty much nothing characters and there are some other side characters who don&#039;t really have anything to them. <br />
<br />
Art: <br />
<br />
The artwork is nicely done. It&#039;s got some good details. The backgrounds are well done. The various animals we see are drawn nicely. The action sequences are great. The only real issue I have with it is that it does suffer at times from &quot;shounen design.&quot; Basically, having characters who are supposed to look interesting and unique but look kind of stupid. The big examples are Tsurumi &amp; Ushiyama. I know we&#039;re supposed to find them both somewhat intimidating, but it&#039;s hard to view them that way since they both look goofy. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Kobayashi Chikahiro, Shiraishi Haruka &amp; Nakata Jouji deserve a lot of praise for their performances in this. While all the performances are pretty good, those three are fantastic in their roles. Suehiro Kenichiro&#039;s soundtrack is nicely composed as well. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a bit where a couple guys fall for a cross dressing man, but that&#039;s about it. And when they find out he is a man one of them really freaks out and the other isn&#039;t too happy when he comes to his senses. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
Skip the vast majority of the hunting scenes. We really don&#039;t need to see a long explanation for how to hunt bear or a fox or a rabbit. If we wanted to know that, we&#039;d be watching Huntin&#039; and Killin&#039; with Jimbo &amp; Ned. If you need to put in some filler to stall for time, at least have the characters talk about something interesting or use the time to develop some characters. Long explanations about hunting techniques aren&#039;t either. <br />
Let Asirpa realise that Sugimoto is not, in fact, practising coprophagia. The joke works at first but after a while it just gets old and you want it to end. <br />
Rework the designs for Tsurumi &amp; Ushiyama. The idea behind Tsurumi&#039;s design might work if you had his scalp torn open and his skull clearly visible in a more disturbing way rather than making it look like he&#039;s wearing a white plate strapped to his forehead, but Ushiyama&#039;s flashy square in his forehead will never not look stupid. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
In the end, Golden Kamuy is a pretty solid series. There might be some things that don&#039;t work very well, but at its core the series has a compelling concept, well written major characters, strong artwork and animation and good performances. Is it among the best anime ever made? No. Is it a good, entertaining series? Yes. My final rating is going to stand at a 7/10.

    This Cabela&#039;s Hunting simulation game was amazing. 10/10 would definitely buy this game again.  This is a wonderful anime about hunting.  You follow our heroes as they hunt foxes, whales, fish, bears, squirrels and other game.  It will teach you how to survive in the wilderness when the crap hits the fan. Need to know how to gut a deer and warm yourself with its innards? Golden Kamuy has got you.  Need to know how to burn poop in order to antagonize a wolf? Golden Kamuy has got you. Need to know how to skin a squirrel? Golden Kamuy has got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295045">
        you.  Need to know how to skin a human? Yes, even then, Golden Kamuy has got you.  <br />
<br />
This anime was brought to you buy a team of psychopaths who will simultaneously teach you how to track and hunt people, and laugh while doing it.  You&#039;ll wonder if you&#039;re losing a part of your soul as you laugh as people are gutted and attacked by wild orcas. Death has never been so hilarious.  <br />
<br />
In all seriousness, this is a good anime.  It&#039;s pretty insane, but not the most insane thing I&#039;ve seen today, since I also watched a the first few episodes of Zombie Land Saga, but it&#039;s pretty close.  Basically, a war hero who survives every attempt to kill him and an ethnic hunter girl, team up to track down and skin inmates who have a map to a mountain of gold that was stolen from her people.  As word spreads about the maps, former military elites, and remnants of the Shinsengumi start hunting for the gold, too.  Which leads to lots of chaos and death and gore and...laughs? <br />
<br />
That&#039;s probably the most surprising thing about this anime, is that it&#039;s really funny.  Animes like this are usually very serious, but Golden Kamuy manages to mix in tons of humor while war veterans and convicts pretty much massacre each other in very gory ways.  <br />
<br />
Outside of that, the characters are likable, the story is interesting, and while the animation could be better, it&#039;s not bad.  I really have no complaints about the anime. It&#039;s pretty good. Although, the ending of the season was kind of flat as it was just a bridge for the second season.  Fortunately, I&#039;m watching this late, so I don&#039;t have to wait for a second season after finishing this.  <br />

    HINNA HINNA<br />
<br />
i feel like i should just write that a hundred times for my review... but someone might read this so i&#039;ll try to do a legit (ish) review.<br />
<br />
Basically, this story is inspiring to me. not because of the effort that the two main characters (Asirpa and Sugimoto) put forth, in spite of all their hardships. not because of the trust these two characters gave to each other. not because of the artwork or musical score. not because of anything other than the peek into Ainu life. only because of &quot;hinna, hinna&quot; if you will.<br />
<br />
i had never considered that there might be native Japanese people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304559">
        like there are native American people. i had even studied up a bit on Japanese history (because i so thoroughly enjoy anime). before Asirpa i was blind. i was missing a part of the Japanese &quot;story.&quot; Golden Kamuy tipped me into what i thought to be a puddle of culture that turned out to be a much larger body of metaphorical water. lul<br />
<br />
i have not spent a great deal of time studying them, but i can confirm; i would love to meet someone with a significant portion of Ainu blood and culture in their life. their spiritual beliefs, their social customs. i want to learn!<br />
<br />
if this review somehow interests you (waow, many surprise) then i suggest you give this show a shot. you might love it!<br />
<br />
thanks for reading this far, (or skipping to the end!! cheaters... もう)<br />

    When trying to tell someone why they should watch this show it&#039;s hard to figure out where to begin. Golden Kamuy is really it&#039;s own thing. If I had to compare it, It&#039;s got the bizarreness of JoJo, the humor of Gintama and the action of  Rurouni Kenshin.<br />
<br />
 This isn&#039;t a realistic anime, so if that&#039;s what you want out of it your not going to find it. It&#039;s about Eccentric people after gold and butting heads in the bizarre ways.<br />
<br />
The pacing of this show isn&#039;t for everybody. If you want action all the time it&#039;s not that show. It places a large emphasis

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320317">
        on survival and character interaction. I love this stray from the norm, however it might not be for everyone. If you&#039;re a fan of slice of life then this is a welcome addition. A fair bit of the show is spent gathering food and eating while by the campfire.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t let the other reviews fool you, there&#039;s a ton of action. And the fights in particular get intense. If you don&#039;t like blood or brutal fighting. Then this show probably isn&#039;t for you because it&#039;s loaded with it.<br />
<br />
The story itself hasn&#039;t gotten me too engaged personally but the characters make the show. The world feels very lived in and the characters aren&#039;t just there as tools for the story to progress. They feel like they have there own lives. A lot of characters in anime feel like soulless NPC&#039;s I don&#039;t really get that from this show.

    Geno is a very new study, coming from people who used to work in Manglobe. His quality is by novice, now with the director of Goshik and with the screenwitter of Baccano?<br />
<br />
-Synopsis-<br />
A soldier named &quot;Sugimoto the Immortal&quot;, after the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, starts looking for gold to pay for the operation of sight of the widow of a friend fallen in combat. There he discovers that there is a treasure map of the &quot;Ainu&quot; (Nippon Eskimos) and joins with a loli of this tribe to get hold of it. And there are CG bears.<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
the story is quite interesting, there is a lot of hidden

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279424">
        gold and the only clues to find it are tattoos of very dangerous people, this leads to two things, one to be interested in who will be the next rival to face and two, learn about the culture Ainu, and see some decent moments of action, which will make Golden kamuy a pretty entertaining story<br />
<br />
-Art,Sound and staff-<br />
Produced by Geno, it looks pretty decent, chapter two is pretty loose in terms of section, but the 3rd and the recent have a quality that is passable, the soundtrack captures some scenes very well and the opening and ending are very good, up here ok, the only bad thing is the CGI<br />
<br />
-Characters-<br />
Sugimoto is by far the best character in the series, similar to guts (berserk), it is very well sized and it is interesting to see how it goes from crazy assassin to serious and calm man, Asirpa is also a very solid character, and is not a immature loli as we are used to seeing in the industry, and Yoshitake is quite charismatic, the rest of the characters are interesting and as they move forward they may find themselves with some pretty solid villains.<br />
<br />
-conclusion-<br />
The story is interesting, the Ainu culture too, and if the quality does not decline we may see incredible action scenes with sugimoto facing people in search of gold oh people who carry tattoos, highly recommended if you are looking for a series of action and adventures<br />
<br />
Sorry for my bad English<br />

    This was such a fantastic show. Not only is is setting and time period very unique for an anime. But just about everything else here was very well done. The only major thing I can think if that holds it back, along with the seemingly cookie cutter set up, is the art and animation. So yes, while the manga does it better in that regard. This is still a very faithful and excellent adaptation of an already amazing story. The characters are all very distinguishable and cool, the story once it gets going is very captivating and easy to follow, and even the comedy is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282192">
        really good. It&#039;s a real good time. <br />
<br />
Story: the story is very straight forward to start. Simple treasure hunt set up. But with an interesting twist, the map to the treasure is tattooed on the bodies of a number of escaped convicts, adding some life and death stakes to an already harrowing situation. Not only finding the stash of gold, but first having to hunt down and maybe kill all the convicts to get their skins. Once it sets the board so to speak, it gets really vibrant and sprawling. There&#039;s a lot of moving parts by the time this initial season is over. Numerous players in this game working for numerous sides to their own ends. All chasing this legendary amount of Ainu gold. It&#039;s essentially a Japanese Western. Which leads to some really in a sense typical plot points. But the characters and the way this handled are amazing. 9.<br />
<br />
Art: from CG bears, wolves, and later horses, the art and animation is definitely the shows weakest point and about the only thing holding it back. While it does leave a lot to be desired in many shots and scenes. It is by no means show breaking. Comparatively it pales to the manga. But it gets the job done. Plus at least once, or more depending on things, we get some really good shots in there too. 7.<br />
<br />
Sound: there&#039;s not too much to speak about on the sound I think. It was good. Snow sounded like snow, the animals sounded like animals, everything fit with sound effects and such. Speaking on the voice acting. Watched both the sub and the dub. Both are all really good, can&#039;t go wrong either way really. Both have a few minor drawbacks, but are still solid. 8.<br />
<br />
Characters: the absolute best part of this show, and this world really, the characters shine so brightly it&#039;s nuts. Sugimoto himself our lead is while not looking it really, a very compelling guy and a great lead for our story. His brash devil may care attitude from being a war veteran, something rare as hell in anime and kinda cool, gives his nickname of Immortal Sugimoto some real credence. That side of him is only rivaled by his very caring and kind nature when he&#039;s around Asirpa. She is great too. Serving as our co lead and lead female character, Asirpa is a great gateway into the Ainu culture which itself is very fascinating.  She&#039;s a very strong willed girl with a lot of spunk and a ton of personality to boot. Asirpa does also add a lot of comedy to the story at certain points. All which hit really well. Along with our Escape King Shirashi, the comedy is very well done and genuinely funny. All the side characters and &quot;villains&quot; are all very good characters and all stand on their own as unique personalities. From Ushiyama, to Hijitaka, to Tanigaki, to Ogata, to Tsurumi, to even Kiroranke at the end, they all make themselves a valuable part of the story and help move it along. 10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: save to say I really enjoyed this show. It has such a cool feel to it and everything clicks. I loved every single episode and all the story beats clicked so well. It was a fun time and enjoyed every minute. 10.<br />
<br />
Overall: as made evident by this already lengthy review, loved it all. Being a manga reader I pretty much knew what to expect going in, but is was still captivated all over again. This story is so very unique one in a sense, but always very familiar too. It fits a very specific niche I suppose. But I do also think it applies to a wide audience and can be enjoyed by just about anyone. With the announcement of a Season 2 (!!!!!!) in October, my excitement and joy cannot be measured. Fantastic series. 9/10.

    Golden Kamuy kicks off with a rather weak introduction. It doesn&#039;t give an impression that this &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot; is worth chasing, because they just boast the pile of golden chunks with simplicity and dullness even though it&#039;s obvious that a lot of people would think of it as an intriguing theme. Then it proceeds with an endless cycle between hunting game and &quot;hinna hinna&quot; utopia where the main characters can slack off a little bit with nice traditional custom and feast.<br />
<br />
The visuals are quite detaching, as the background feels too pencil-sketchy sometimes, the characters lack consistency in face and body proportions, and also some annoying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382251">
        3D CGIs of bears and wolves. Facial expressions are somewhat comic and hit at the right spots when needed because otherwise, this anime would be so boring and shallow. <br />

    In case someone just wants the quick review right away, my verdict is that if you have even a bit of curiosity in the manga series or manga in general, then read this over watching it.<br />
<br />
Story: The source material for this manga is absolutely great. A comedy adventure Seinen which is a dream come true for my interests. The world is fairly fleshed in the anime, although the manga does moreso through the introduction of historical context and small tirades about local wildlife and food. The characters themselves become very interesting, more get introduced with their distinct personalities and reactions. One thing about adventure manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282296">
        and anime that is fantastic is that eventually, you come to know how a character should react, because you become in tune with their personalities. Golden Kamuy does a good job at introducing these kind of characters. One BIG fault in the anime i saw is that my personal favorite arc, (focusing on an old samurai, his comrade, and a sniper wandering into a lawless town. It was explicitly Kurosawa thing to do, the author wrote a love letter to the samurai films of old.) That was completely cut out. Now it&#039;s a nitpick maybe to some,at 12 episodes things have to be skipped and streamlined. But even then, the final episode landed on an arbitrary note. It could have easily ended on the samurai arc. Again personal nitpick that highlights that the manga is filled with more information. 7/10<br />
<br />
Art: CGI bears everywhere. Good lord i hope they make them look better because there is an arc with 3 bears constantly in frame as a foe. Besides that though, the artstyle is adequate. People are identifiable, movement is sometimes a little choppy but it works, the comical facial expressions translate well. 6/10<br />
<br />
Sound: nice opening theme and ending theme, but i can&#039;t say i remember much of the music within the actual episodes. In fact, at times i felt the show was too quiet, although that kinda adds to the natural aspect of it. 6/10<br />
<br />
Characters: I have already stated above that the characters are amazing. Interesting dynamics arise as you follow 3 groups that have their own goals, getting even more interesting when they bleed into each other as members start using various groups for their own gain. I can&#039;t get too into detail because i feel it is much more effective to watch it. 9/10<br />
<br />
Overall: Good introduction, but the manga is much closer to the authors vision so if it interests you please go read it. If not and you enjoy the manga, rejoice because you get a second season this same years.

    Hello there this is ma first review on MAL...<br />
On my first review am going to write about the Anime &#039;Golden Kamuy&#039;.First thing is this anime is about a guy who team up with a Ainu girl(a Japanese tribe)to search a vast amount of gold which is hidden.<br />
Story: As mentioned above its like a treasure hunt but the thing is anime takes place during Meiji era.(Japanese ruler who ruled japan around 1914 and who supported modernization in japan)So the theme of war can be seen.A guy kills the members of Ainu tribe and steals their gold n he hides it somewhere.When he was arrested he draws

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279681">
        tattoos on the bodies of prisoners n that will lead to the &#039;treasure&#039; that is hidden.So bla bla happens n prisoners escape from prison n they spread out.After that they come to know in order to get the gold they need all the tattoo patterns and the story goes...Story is decent but one more plus thing is this anime also covers about the tradition of Ainu tribe,the way they used to live and also the practice of peoples in that era...Story is good as well as informative so i gave it a score 9...<br />
Art: I will keep this short.Artwork is good..the background ,fight scenes are decently animated and looks fine..but only thing i thought which didn&#039;t fit is the &#039;bear&#039; animation(you will understand when you watch the anime)<br />
Sound: Background music,voice acting,Opening as well as ending are just fine..Especially the voice acting of both Sugimoto and Asirpa are good...<br />
Character: Main characters are great..Asirpa a wise girl who knows how to handle tools as well as the nature in order to survive and hates killing people..N our hero the &#039;Immortal&#039; Sugimoto who don&#039;t even hesitate to kill people if his life is on the line...And If i take other characters into consideration they just do their role perfectly..Overall the characters are decent and the design is unique...<br />
Overall and Enjoyment: Trust me if you are a fan of historical anime you will love this for sure..Overall anime is great as well as informative.I would say one of the best currently airing anime..I suggest give it a try..Ty:)
