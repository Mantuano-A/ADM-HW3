    Sometimes I think back on my experience with Inuyasha and my conclusions about it have always been conflicted. It was the first anime that I watched whole heartedly, and it was the first thing that brought me into the realm of Japanese media and culture. I&#039;ve come to love anime and manga, appreciate the history and the different styles and subtleties that come with every genre and now consider it a very large and colorful part of my life. Naturally I look back on Inuyasha with a sense of fondness,the yellow volumes and DVD&#039;s on my shelves only a small testament to the dedication I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52849">
        had to the story. However as I said, Inuyasha is something I think about with a degree of conflict. It was the work that introduced me to the magical world of Japanese television, however in its own right Inuyasha is the most chaotic and exasperating anime I&#039;ve probably ever seen.<br />

There are flaws in the overall composition. Things one might ask themselves like; why, if you KNEW you we&#039;re going to be trekking across feudal Japan for months on end, would you bring only one outfit? And more importantly why would it be your Junior High School uniform - i.e. a bright green miniskirt? <br />

Regardless, the story itself is very weak, as its the random plot arcs and ridiculous character relations that really make the show. To summarize, a young girl falls down a well at her family&#039;s shrine, only to be transported back in time to feudal Japan, where she frees a grumpy dog eared half demon man who is stuck to a tree (The result of a bad breakup) and ends up breaking a magical mystical artifact that then shatters into a bazillion pieces. Ditzy teenage girl and pissy dog demon guy now must work together to find all the shards of &quot;The Sacred Jewel&quot; before the bad guys do. Sure there&#039;s another load of subplots - pointless, funny and romantic alike - but we&#039;ll get to that. <br />
Although the premise is simplistic it does expand further along in the story, but only if one likes the show enough initially to move on in the series through the 160 + episodes. <br />
The subplots and the arcs are what make this series entertaining. (And also agonizing if the arc you&#039;re in bores you to tears) We&#039;ll have run ins with random demons and get mixed up with numerous characters who may or may not come and go. Each plot brings changes and the characters do a very good job of growing and evolving as a result. The series does, despite its episodic nature, still follow some sense of linearity. Development in the characters remain as they would in a real person. (This excludes the Inuyasha movies, unfortunately) <br />
Despite all that, its still one of those series that makes it very easy to drop in at any time and figure things out eventually. I watched from the middle first before I decided I loved the show and went back to see the beginning - which was drastically different to me considering the amount of change that takes place from beginning to middle to end. <br />
I can&#039;t go into detail very well considering the story, as there is so much of it its hard to find a place to start. The elements of the setting and time really come into play with the presence of the spirits and demons all of which offer a uniqueness all to its own. The multiple love triangle issues are superficial but also complex, so there is a degree of decent conflict in that regard. I also really appreciate personally how the development of the relationship between the two main characters, Inuyasha and Kagome, is gradual. <br />
<br />
Coming to the characters, there are many. Too many to identify them all in this review. This is a great thing about the show, but can also be annoying and for the casual observer, confusing as hell. I&#039;ll touch on the main characters at least:<br />
Kagome is a really plain Junior High School girl. As a heroine she starts out pathetically dull and often comes off as a total ditz. However if you give her a chance she does show you how she can grow to be a capable human being despite the fact that she is a 15 year old idiot running around feudal Japan in a miniskirt. Throughout the show we find shes short tempered, opinionated and rash, but she does keep a sense femininity intact somehow. She also retains an ability to sympathize with and care for the people she comes to know. What I love about her is that she starts out completely incompetent. Literally she is nothing but a Mary-Sue-ish teenage airhead with little care in the world aside doing well in school, and she morphs (gradually) into a priestess who can use a bow and even protect herself. She - going through the show constantly compared to the priestess Kikiyo (Details will become clear if you decide to watch the show) she makes a deliberate effort to break free of that confine and become her own person, and I like that. <br />
Inuyasha is also a great source of character development. I know I keep saying &quot;Development development development!&quot; but really is one of the biggest things this show has going for itself. I almost see this anime as some kind of document of how Inuyasha becomes a man. Hes over 50 years old but despite that he is extremely childish, boorish and often rude and annoying. He also works pretty hard to gain strength and create a name for himself. He is an &#039;underdog&#039; (lol puns) and also has a bit of a Gary-Stu thing going for him.  Being a half demon with a snobby older brother and a messed up undead ex-girlfriend gives him a lot of stuff to complain about. <br />
The characters ARE shallow. But their relationships are entertaining and - if you get all the way to the end of this series and the short Inuyasha Sequel: Inuyasha the Final Act - are rewarding to see until the end. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll keep the review of the art quick in saying that it is very traditional for the time it was made. Its got a lot of square and rectangular shapes and brightly colored character designs that fit in well with its shounen genre. The style is very consistent, budget obviously allowed for lots of attention to detail and a tone of seriousness. It has its own sort of beauty, very reminiscent of Takahashi&#039;s earlier works like Ranma 1/2 and the like, which aired in the late 1980&#039;s. Almost a retro anime style if you get my meaning. Movies have much more bold and sharp lines. Character designs could use work (I can&#039;t get over the miniskirt thing, I&#039;m sorry. Its just too stupid. And I get really sick of Inuyasha never wearing anything but his giant red.. thing)<br />
<br />
Even quicker, my opinion of the sound. The music is diverse and beautifully complex. One of the best parts of the show. Multiple opening and ending themes, background music all magical and perfectly suitable to the time period. Voice acting is always better in Japanese. English is very harsh on the ears, I strongly dislike it nowadays. <br />
<br />
Very long review and I&#039;ve only just scratched the surface. Inuyasha, as I see it, is a classic shounen. Its time in the limelight long passed when it made room for Naruto and Bleach to move in on the scene. For those of you who can take a long series and like the sound of this show, give it a shot. Perhaps google a list of filler episodes you might feel like skipping if this does tickle your fancy. Inuyasha does have something for everyone. From the action to the supernatural, to the romantic and the historical. Its a story hard to place and hard to review with a fair share of chaos and confusion. Its a mess, really. But its a big fun mess if you&#039;re willing to see it through. <br />
As always, keep good humor in mind while watching. This show is bananas and it will make you want to throw objects at the screen from time to time. <br />
<br />
For now, I tip my hat to Inuyasha. I thank it for showing me this world, showing me complexity and hilarity, and for showing me how flaws can be celebrated for their entertainment just as well as the parts that shine.

    Overall, Inuyasha is very enjoyable. The art is brilliant although in the movies the art does slip because Rumiko Takahashi (the mangaka) helps with the drawings.<br />
<br />
The storyline is basic and very easy to follow, however the story does seem to drag on, so if you have patience with animes this could be for you.<br />
<br />
The characters are pure genius, each with their own running joke. Each character (with the exception of Kagome) has a dark and kind of upsetting past often including the death of a loved one. My favourite is Miroku by far. He is a perverted womanising monk who flirts with pretty much any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6639">
        girl. However, some characters, like Shippo (an adorable fox demon), have a minor role with little or no fight scenes. (Then again that&#039;s a small part of his jokes).<br />
<br />
The fights are good, lots of blood in some places. However the fights are short and it seems to always be Inuyasha doing most of the work. (As he has stated a few times). The others seem to be back up and use the same moves. For example, Sango, a demon slayer, uses her Hirakotsu (a giant boomerang often used hitting Miroku when he flirts with other girls or touches her butt) but she has a sword which rarely gets used. I think I&#039;ve seen it 3 times and then I can only remember when she is about to use it on Kohaku (her little brother who has no memory of killing their whole village because he&#039;s being controlled by the main bad guy).<br />
<br />
The romance is my favourite part in all of the series. It&#039;s more sweet than it is romantic. But it&#039;s the sort that makes you feel all warm inside. I&#039;m sad to say that the romance barely progresses. (Apart from Miroku and Sango). And there is a really big love net. But like I said, it sweet in a LOT of  places.(Oh, for you fan girls, I know Sesshomaru, Inuyasha&#039;s brother, is a favourite. Oh, I&#039;m not a fan girl.)<br />
<br />
All in all, Inuyasha is a good anime (and my favourite). Watch it if you have patience and love a good laugh, fight sometimes full of blood and sweet romantic bits in an anime.<br />

    The jokes got old fast, InuYasha and Sesshoumaru were the only characters with much character development, the fights were boring (InuYasha was a bad fighter, anyway), and the romance was like a cheap soap opera. The romance never progressed, nor did anything else, really. It&#039;s sad, because the characters were potentially very likeable, but as I said before, Sango, Miroku, and Shippou had no character development at all, and Kagome only had a little.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s really not much of a plot. Think of it as Dragon Ball for girls, and you&#039;ve pretty much got it. Kagome, Inuyasha, and friends search for pieces of a broken jewel.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2013">
        They find half of the jewel within the first couple of episodes, but another 150 episodes, give or take, go by after that with the jewel still incomplete. The series goes on seemingly forever with little progress in plot or character development. The seemingly infinite, pointless filler episodes that provide no character development and little, if any, entertainment, while also making up over half of the series, don&#039;t help matters. <br />
<br />
Some of the fight scenes in the first few episodes were rather exciting, so this made up for the lack of character development. After all, it&#039;s pretty much natural for an action series to sacrifice character and story development for good action scenes. But as the show went on, InuYasha relied more and more on one big, flashy attack that finished every fight. The same animation of InuYasha using that attack was used in many of the episodes, as well. And instead coming up with a variety of different ways to stop InuYasha&#039;s technique, they just relied on the use of the same device over and over again. So the fight scenes, like much of the series, became very repetitive.<br />
<br />
There are good aspects to this show. The artwork is beautiful, even if the fights reuse the same scene of InuYasha using his strongest move for nearly every fight. InuYasha is a very touching character, and Kagome is a character that is easy to identify with. However, anyone who knows the series Fruits Basket can see quickly that InuYasha and Kyo Sohma are nearly identical in personality, so InuYasha and Sesshoumaru&#039;s pretty faces, Kagome, and the occasional episode that&#039;s actually funny (a couple of them were hilarious) end up being the only really good reasons to watch. <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s mainly the plot (or lack thereof) and lack of character development that stop this anime from being great. Of course, being an action series, a lack of character development would&#039;ve been fine if the fights were entertaining, but the entertainment value of the fight scenes is rather low. I definitely recommend watching a few episodes. There&#039;s fun to be had with this series, but the sub-par aspects of the show drag it down, making it something that&#039;s far worse than the sum of its parts.

    Inuyasha started off very well, it is fairly entertaining at the beginning of the series, with the story progressing rapidly at the start, coupled with lots of humour by Kagome. However, the series quicly deteriorated when the fillers start kicking in, and even in the later stages, many of the scenes and jokes were repetitive, not to mention the lack of plot development.Probably the only exceptions were episodes relating to Kagome\&#039;s life in the present world - these episodes were definately worth re-watching.<br />
<br />
After the intoduction of the fourth protagonist ( Sango), apart from a few side-stories, the plot essentially deteriorates into a viscous cycle. In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review649">
        a few occasions it seems there will be some new development, but I was dissapointed when the same-old thing happened again. The fillers were heavily Naruto-like, admittedly better.<br />
<br />
Overall: I think the series can be alot better, but if you like extended series, this could be for you.<br />

    When I watched InuYasha, I had not seen Blue Seed yet. Now that I have, I realize that InuYasha was a bit of a rip off of Blue Seed. Especially the love triangle between Kagome, Kikyo, and InuYasha is exactly the same as in Blue Seed. InuYasha does go in its own direction, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s mainly because Blue Seed was only 26 episodes and InuYasha is over 150 episodes. <br />
<br />
InuYasha does have an exciting story to it, which I admit; I do enjoy InuYasha more than I do Blue Seed. One thing that I just loved about InuYasha was Sesshoumaru. I think InuYasha,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review539">
        for being such a long series; it does a good job of not repeating itself. I really enjoyed the imagination and creativity put into the establishment of such a variety of demons, humans, and hanyous. . InuYasha is always branching off into new stories, which is good, always keeping your attention and the excitement, plus they are never left untold. I know most series will start a side story and just leave you hanging on never knowing what happens. When that happens, rather its a good anime or not, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin disliking it like in Escaflowne (which I am referring to the whole Allen and his sister situation).<br />
<br />
All the characters have wonderful depth and delightful personalities. My favorite relationship out of the whole, well 2 relationships, are Sesshomaru, Rin, and Jakens, then Miruko and Sango have a nice little thing going on between them. A plus about InuYasha, it keeps everything going smoothly, bringing in characters that are just, well can&amp;rsquo;t help but love, like the 7 man army that joins (I think) during the 90&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s or 100&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s, somewhere around there. <br />
<br />
I have watched InuYasha both in dubbed and subbed versions. The English dub is pretty good, but I prefer the Japanese dialogue, mainly because the voices fit better with the characters personalities. Oh and it&amp;rsquo;s like OMG the music in InuYasha is awesome. I have 2 of the soundtracks, and I just love every minute of it. So not only are you going to get to enjoy an incredible charming series, but listen to delightful music. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend InuYasha, but I also believe you should watch Blue Seed too if you like InuYasha. All Audiences should enjoy this anime. It provides a nice amount of comedy, action, adventure, romance, so everyone should enjoy InuYasha.<br />

    Story - 4 - It sounds like another shounen adventure with a little romance and a plot where people need to collect something. You know what? Thats what it exactly is. Lol. But, in the beginning it was enjoyable. As it progressed, it got me more and more annoyed till I was about to quit. But I hung to it and tried to finish it just because I wanted to see two characters appear: Rin and Sesshomaru. The end was just a cliff hanger.<br />
<br />
Art - 3 - People looked plain. Almost everyone&#039;s hair is black, brown, or a different shade of black/brown. Mostly, theres only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18016">
        like 3 1/2 people who have a different color hair. Yes, 1/2 a person because one of them has two hair colors. At least they varied what the people wore.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8 - I did like the music and character themes.<br />
<br />
Characters - 4 - (the main)<br />
<br />
Kagome - 3 - I seriously don&#039;t see the resemblance in appearances to Kikyou. I really think all the characters who mistake her for kikyou are half blind. I dislike Kagome. The reason why I wanted to quit was because of her. Like, if the main character is really annoying, then you would want to quit too. She gets jealous, a LOT. I mean, its okay to be jealous, but /every/ time even if kikyou just says 1 word to Inuyasha, she throws a fit. Ahhh, so stubborn too, naiive, and obnoxious.<br />
<br />
Inuyasha - 7 - Hes a Tsundere, which means someone who acts rough but really is soft in the inside. He wants to protect Kagome so much. Oh, they both like each other but won&#039;t ever, ever admit it. Hes pretty dense; Always misses the hints Kagome and Kikyou give him. Like most guy mains, they want to become stronger and stronger to protect the people they see dear.<br />
<br />
Sango, Miroku, and Shippo - 6 - They focus little compared to Inuyasha and Kagome. But, as anything, they were so much more interesting than Kagome&#039;s personality. I thought the Miroku and Sango couple was so much entertaining than the main couple in this anime.<br />
<br />
Sesshomaru and Rin - 9 - They are mysterious, and the only reason that got me to finish this horrid anime. I thought their relationship was so sweet.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3 - I had little enjoyment with this and only 1/3 of the whole series was enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall - 4 - If you ask me, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to many people, and I cant see how this anime has a rating of around 7. I mean, if you like shows with fighting, romance, and a very annoying main, then you should watch it. (;

    Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.<br />
<br />
I debated writing a review for Inuyasha since I believe for the most part the majority of people already know what they think of it but after forcing myself to re-watch the series I felt compelled to write this.   <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is designed to never end and gives you roughly 4 filler episodes in-between anything that actually progresses the story. Is it a spoiler to tell you that at the end of 167 episodes they still have to complete the jewel and defeat the villain? Well I wish someone would have spoiled it for me. However despite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167173">
        saying that the anime clearly isn&#039;t trying in any way to have an interesting or meaningful story so some of you maybe able to over look that. This is a anime that is trying to relie on fights and characters to be entertaining.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Honest opinion? I&#039;ve seen better and I won&#039;t be watching anything worst I hope. Mediocrity&#039;s definition really. Normally art is one of the last things I base a anime on. Sure it&#039;s important but to me so long as everything looks okay I don&#039;t care. However in the case of Inuyasha the fighting animations were really disappointing. If you don&#039;t wanna have a story that is fine, but in this case with nothing else going for it I feel like going beyond normal really would have made a huge difference in term of enjoyability.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Meh.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
They are all so shallow. One personality trait was handed to each of them and trust me they only get one. If you don&#039;t think mary-sue after meeting kagome read a fan-fiction with an oc. Actually never mind, it would probably be better.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Inuyasha may have been more enjoyable if it hadn&#039;t of been so long. Also since I didn&#039;t find it funny (I don&#039;t like slapstick humor) that to could contribute to it&#039;s lack of enjoyability.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
It get&#039;s a 5. Inuyasha easily could have gotten a seven if it had done one of two things, either developed nicer fights or developed it&#039;s characters at all. It&#039;s a long anime with nothing going for it. If you like pointless filler episodes there are animes that cater to that much better, If you like action then there are animes that also cater to that much better. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day it&#039;s hard to find something outstanding or great about Inuyasha. It is an anime I can not recommend to anyone.

    Personally, I was surprised to see that not many people enjoys this anime as much as I do especially when I tend to watch a lot of animes and get bored then quit. I first watched this a few years ago, it entertained both me and my mom. Then recently, I re-watched everything the beginning to what I&#039;ve missed and I still find that I enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The characters are all complete, but they can still be frustrating in their own ways. For instance, Kagome has a strong heart and remains pure, but she can seem to fend for herself and always trouble the people around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22752">
        her, yet she still insists to join every fight. <br />
Inuyasha is a hot-headed and adorable, but he can&#039;t seem to grow up and learn from his experiences. His sword obtains more and more powers, but he&#039;s too childish sometimes that it makes me feel that he&#039;s unworthy of wielding such a sword. However, on the occasions where he and sword becomes one, it becomes an excellent fight.<br />
Miroku and Sango always seem to have the attention taken away by Inuyasha, they sometimes are really helpless in a fight without him. <br />
Still, the characters being reliant on each other just shows the bond they have.<br />
The catchy characters are ones like Sesshomaru, Rin, and a lot of times the bad guys.<br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t that great, but after a while, you&#039;d get accustomed to it. The art isn&#039;t terrible so I just got used to it.<br />
<br />
The plot on a whole is awesome, it&#039;s just the tiny little bits in it that gets too repetitive. Such as the number of pointless fights, the number of failures, and how long it takes to obtain a clue. Even so, I still find it entertaining, and the action was well made. <br />
<br />
The comedy sometimes gets repetitive, but if you don&#039;t take it too seriously, you won&#039;t stop laughing that easily.<br />
<br />
On a whole, while it has its flaws, I think this anime is great. You just shouldn&#039;t take it too seriously. This anime ended with a cliff hanger in waiting for the next season, which I have seen up till it last aired and I think it has improved dramatically. Definitely worth a watch

    Inuyasha was one of the earlier anime that I had watched and is one of the few anime that are over 100 episodes that I have stuck with. However, this is also one of the series that I am seriously conflicted with.<br />
<br />
The story of Inuyasha is one that I feel drags on for a bit too long. It starts with the simple story of Kagome who is transported to another world and accidentally breaks apart a crystal called the Shikon no Tama that she has to put back together. Along the way she meets people who become her friends and enemies. However, Inuyasha is one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179219">
        series that I feel the story that goes on for longer than necessary. The main enemy nearly always makes clean escapes and comes back stronger. The heroes then receive an upgrade to fight the new empowered villain and this goes on for a while. While this is typical of a lot of anime, the pacing is what ultimately hurts it. The earlier episodes have great pacing, but towards the middle and later episodes, it feels like it was beginning to drag out to the point where it became a formula. The earlier parts of the series even had more interesting Youkais that existed in Kagome&#039;s world as well. The one episode that keeps coming back to my mind is the one where one of the main characters is walking through a sacred mountain and has to avoid thinking perverted thoughts and staring at the butt of a female character. I felt like that was not necessary.<br />
<br />
I really like the art style of this series for some reason. The effects used for special abilities felt like they were something that did not belong and ultimately, I felt that it was a good thing because it emphasized how Miroku&#039;s Kazaana could be supernatural and otherworldly in nature. The thing that I dislike is the fact that a lot of character faces look too similar to one another. I did not notice it at first, but it became problematic in the latter part of the series as they introduced more characters. However, it seemed like they gave up entirely with generic villagers and I sometimes felt like they were just running into the same few people who always got into trouble.<br />
<br />
The sounds of the series definitely contributed to the feel of the series. One thing I liked is that they were very consistent with the usage of their music, such as that one song they play whenever a fight is coming up. The opening songs were kind of strange to me for some reason and felt awkward and out of place. Then again, I do remember the first one very well so maybe it did its job after all.<br />
<br />
The characters that I liked in this series were the ones that received only some character development, such as Sango. She had a strong reason for fighting and the way she was introduced set her up as a tragic heroine. This was done well, but there are other times when characters like Inuyasha spend too much time thinking about which girl he feels closer to when one is an undead clone that will fade away and Kagome trying to figure out whether she loves a minor character boy from her own time or Inuyasha. <br />
<br />
Overall, the series was mediocre at best. It has a strong beginning, a very weak middle, but improves again towards the end. It gets much better with the sequel series that is also the conclusion. However, this one felt disappointing as it went on.

    Overview: Back in the early 2000s, Inuyasha had the highest viewer ratings of any anime on adult swim. It was THE popular anime! How does this old series hold up a decade later?<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
<br />
The story starts out with a fairly interesting premise. A young girl who belongs to a very traditional Japanese family falls into an old well and is transported back in time to a feudal Japan filled with demons and magic. She changes history by shattering a powerful artifact called the Shikon no Tama and the shards of this powerful gem shoot all over hell and back for some reason! Seriously, one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164607">
        the shards ends up in the world of the afterlife for God&#039;s Sake! I know when I break something into a bunch of pieces it is hard to find them all, but I don&#039;t think some pieces actually go into another dimension! Breaking the jewel changes the future so that the girl Kagome ends up fighting some demons in the future world including an admittedly creepy Noh Mask demon that possesses one of the shards of the jewel. If Kagome succeeds in the end in destroying/purifying the jewel in the  past does that mean that the events of the series never happened? Apparently in this world, going back and changing something only affects the timeline from the moment you go back and onwards, like a universal reset.  Well, the time travel aspect is pretty confusing but since Inuyasha doesn&#039;t really conform to either multiverse theory or Novikov&#039;s Self Consistancy principle, I&#039;ll give it bonus points for originality I guess. Inuyasha is essentially a &quot;quest&quot; storyline with the Shikon jewel shards as the desired goal. The plot goes on WAY longer than it needs to, devolves into &quot;monster of the week&quot; bullshit far too often, and the villain Naraku has an annoying habit of never fucking dying! Even despite this, it was often highly imaginative, thrilling, and had far too many good aspects to really hate. Many of the arcs are well done and Takahashi&#039;s romance was clearly better than most shounen of that time period. The largest problem with the anime was the HORRENDOUS filler that resulted in the series getting cancelled. Many shounens have terrible filler, but very few are bad enough to actually cause a very popular anime/manga to be cancelled out of the blue. Inuyasha is one of the exceptions.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
<br />
The main character Kagome is supposed to be the relatable hero that has real world problems in addition to being thrust unwillingly into an epic battle of good vs. evil. She is sort of the Bilbo Baggins of Inuyasha. She is seemingly quite ordinary at first and not at all an action hero, but is brave, kind hearted, and will do the right thing when the time comes. Kagome&#039;s jealousy over Kikyo, believable frustration, and minor flaws make her a fairly rounded character and really not bad for a late 1990s shonen protagonist. She isn&#039;t a clone of Goku, which is better than Naruto, Luffy, Natsu, and fucking half the shonen heroes in existence. Inuyasha is the &quot;jerk with a heart of gold&quot; character with a dark and angsty past and Miroku is the perverted priest that is still a loyal friend, sort of like Aramis from Dumas&#039; 3 Musketeers. Sango is interesting with her tragic past and willingness to resort to darker actions than Kagome in order to do what she feels is right. Her inner torment over her brother&#039;s fate and difficulty confronting her emotions for Miroku make her an argually deeper character than most of the main team. Naraku is a villain that few fans of anime can forget. His highly elaborate evil schemes almost always involved tempting others into doing his dirty work so he never had to dirty his own hands. Although obviously Naraku took inspiration from many nefarious trickster characters including Satan (Naraku means &quot;Hell&quot; in Japanese) I am most closely reminded of Danglars from The Count of Monte Cristo. Naraku is actually a better adaptation of the character than the Danglars we see in Gankutsuou, the actual anime Monte Cristo adaptation. My favorite character without question though is Sesshomaru. The militeristic, power hungry, glory seeking asshole who only after a major injury and being nursed back to health by a young girl has a cathartic moment of self realization and becomes an anti-hero more than just a dick. He shares this character background with Andre Bolkonsky from War and Peace, except Andre put on a fur boa like a transvestite and started kicking the shit out of people! That&#039;s fucking awesome!<br />
<br />
Music: 8/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack by Kaoru Wada, who also did Ninja Scroll, does a great job here. He captures the feeling of feudal Japan and creates an often emotionally moving and visceral soundtrack that I actually own. I&#039;m serious, it is one of maybe 5 anime OST that I actually bought.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art and animation is generally pretty good for the time period. It wasn&#039;t revolutionary, but definitely looked better than most of its contemporaries.<br />
<br />
Entertainment: 4/10<br />
<br />
Inuyasha may have the worst fucking filler episodes of any anime...ever! I&#039;m serious when I say that the DBZ fillers, Naruto fillers, and the other fillers people complain about are godlike quality compared to Inuyasha fillers. This is the stuff of filler legend, like the Rurouni Kenshin anime post Kyoto Arc bad.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
<br />
Inuyasha was honestly WAY overrated when it first came out in the states. Even as someone who loved the manga and looks back fondly on the series, I will admit that. Inuyasha has serious flaws and was simply not one of the greatest anime of all time. The sequel series called Inuyasha: The Final Act at least cut the filler bullshit, but that is a review for another day. I still gave Inuyasha a decent score since it DID do a lot of things right. It also was very unique during the period it came out and helped expand the anime demographic. The number of teenage girl anime fans increased by 1000 percent in the US thanks to Inuyasha. That&#039;s an accomplishment right there. If you are a younger site member and haven&#039;t seen Inuyasha personally, I wouldn&#039;t recommend watching the whole series and sitting through god awful filler bullshit, but check out some of the early episodes and see why older fans went nuts over this series back in the day.<br />

    I have to say that even though this is one of my favourite animes, it has a few drawbacks!<br />
One is that yes, at first, the love triangle between Kagome-Inuyasha-Kikyo is very interesting but by the end of the series I was practically scratching my eyes out wanting Inuyasha to decide who to be with!!! (which is Kagome for me, by the way :3)<br />
<br />
Also, there is a huge lack of character development (which isn&#039;t surprising seeming as the manga was still going strong at the time so nothing conclusive could happen in the anime dissapointingly) especially with Shippo, Koga &amp;amp; Kagome (Miroku and Sango as well,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3375">
        but... XD no spoilers!)<br />
<br />
The most annoying thing by far is the ending, which is so unfinished I&#039;m hoping that someday this anime will carry on!!<br />
<br />
Things I do like now I&#039;ve had my rant XD:<br />
Artwork (Rumiko Takahashi has a refreshingly unique style) Characters (even though they don&#039;t have much development they are very likeable) and the fights are infact not the worst I&#039;ve seen (although Inuyasha goes a bit overkill on the wind scar sometimes)<br />
Yes, some of the jokes are overused (sit boy much?) but I still like them <br />
^-^<br />
<br />
I would recommend this anime to anybody who wants an anime that ticks most categories (fighting, humour, romance etc. etc.) and also fans of the manga! (well duh!)

    This is by far the best anime I have ever seen. The characters are perfectly balanced. The plot is twisted and detailed. So many things all wound up into one package. Demons and humans joining forces to destroy the main bad guy. And it&#039;s not just one group, but many groups going after the same villian. Not to mention all this started from a single little jewel with magical powers which breaks into a million little pieces. Love triangles, comedy, full packed action, drama, and emotive tragedies all wound up into a single anime series. Despite that this anime series is 7 seasons long, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372">
        ends with a cliffhanger. This is by far the worst thing they could do. This addictive anime needs to go on! The popularity is sky rocketing! If you love demonic, magical, and fantasy in a feudal Japan world, then pick up this anime and add it to your list. It&#039;s awesome!

    Kagome Higurashi falls in to a well and meets Inu-Yash. Then the endless, and I do mean endless story begins.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen all the episodes. In the beginning it started great, there was a great story and a good love story between Kagome and Inu-Yasha. Also the other characters were good. Especially Kikyo and Sesshomaru. They just added a new demenshion to the show.<br />
<br />
Now it was really good for a while, but it just keeps going on forever. They re-tell the same basic stories over and over again. The biggest problem I had it with this show is the love story between Inu-Yasha and Kagome. Do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2762">
        they love each other on don&#039;t they. Will they tell each other how the feel or won&#039;t they. It just keeps on going for 167 episodes. I stopped watching other shows for the same reason. Also at the end they haven&#039;t resolved anything. I am extremely disappointed in this show.<br />
<br />
At the beginning I would have given this show a 9 or 10.

    To be honest, this series is something I really tried to like. It seemed like a less testosterone filled shounen anime with a strong romance element and undercurrents of adventure and comedy. On the surface, it looks to be excellent. Attractive art, good ending music (I&#039;ve only watched the dub on adult swim) a satisfactory dub and an interesting enough concept and setting. A spunky, sweet modern day Japanese girl Kagome gets transported in a well to a fantasy laced feudal japan where she must team up with the crude, boisterous half demon Inuyasha (a jerk with a heart of gold and a potential love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56645">
        interest of Kagome), the lecherous monk Miroku and a slew of demons and ordinary peasants to recover a mystical sacred jewel that said girl accidentally smashed into thousands of pieces. While doing this, they have to keep it away from the nefarious and (supposedly) brilliant demon Naraku. Sounds interesting enough right?  However, despite the anime community&#039;s buzz about the show, Inuyasha is the anime equivalent of a polished turd.<br />
<br />
The first problem props up in the pacing and plot. The premise turns out likeable enough, but the vast majority of episodes can be put into equally sortable and equally boring categories. One episode type is where we get Sesshomaru Iinuyasha&#039;s brother causing some sort of mischief with our heroes often involving the tetsuaiga (Inuyasha&#039;s fathers sword who this villain thinks deserves to be his because of his full demon blood).  The thing is though he&#039;s vaguely evil with a cackling sidekick and emotionless girl who never get developed he doesn&#039;t do any real harm because he &#039;deep down&#039; cares for his brother and can be counted on to bring the fight to Naraku anyway because for some unexplained reason they hate each other. This basically makes him a pointless character to induce filler because there is no tension whenever he shows up for the seventh, eighth and thousandth time.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Naraku, this clown is the worse excuse for a villain ever. Even though he is supposedly a mastermind, any reason for him surviving or his plans working can be chalked up to him having his own personal plot armor factory. I can&#039;t count the number of times the main cast has dispelled some kind of magical barrier saying &#039;big bad villain is right here&#039; to nearly kill him and have him retreat or kill him only to turn out our heroes just killed one of his ten billion clones. He also has a sidekick that wants to betray him but never really gets around to it. Again, she&#039;s as flat as the majority of this anime&#039;s characters. If you haven&#039;t gathered, the &#039;fight Naraku and almost get him&#039; episode is the next major type of plot we have that like the Sesshomaru fights have no sense of tension or story advancement at all.<br />
<br />
Occasionally we have episodes where Kagome goes back to modern japan to live a normal teenage life, struggling to catch up in school and get a date because of her weeks spent inside feudal japan. These are generally the best episode type, especially when Inuyasha tags along for the ride and has to disguise the fact that he&#039;s a demon. Unfortunately, this is the rarest of the common episode types and doesn&#039;t really advance character or plot at all.<br />
<br />
Remember how I said that the sacred jewel was smashed in to many pieces? Well, this is the writers favorite excuse to jam pack the show with more filler than Naruto can shake a stick at. Since there are so many jewel shards, somebody thought it was a good idea to create hundreds of cardboard thin villains who manage to get hold of jewel shards which increases their power. The vast majority of these shards gets fed into completely forgotten monster of the week mook demons. Every episode featuring them is as follows:&#039;hey guys something is wrong in this village! Oh my god, a demon! And look, a sacred jewel shard! Let&#039;s kill the demon!&#039; after this, Inuyasha promptly curb stomps said demon with his infinity plus one legendary sword and generic but recyclable shounen powers &#039;wind scar&#039; and &#039;iron reaver soul stealer&#039; which he proceeds to tell you every millionth time he uses.<br />
<br />
Then there are a bunch of minor rouge characters and villains that don&#039;t really do anything to threaten the main cast of the show. There&#039;s disposable filler villains the band of seven who (surprise!) got a hold of some sacred jewel shards, Koga and the wolf demon tribe who also have some jewel shards who snatches kagome but never harms her or is forced to give her up by inuyasha&#039;s blade. There&#039;s also Sesshomaru who although vaguely threatening never really does much of anything except fail to be given character depth or cause nothing but minor irritation to Inuyasha and crew.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem however is the show has likeable characters that don&#039;t ever stop being static to a meaningful extent. The romance aspect is bungled first and foremost by completely useless rival romance options of Kagome and Inuyasha. Kagome has Koga who Kagome pretty much hates for the entire series, and a schoolboy who&#039;s name i forget because he only shows up in the episodes where Kagome treks back to the modern day. For Inuyasha we have the high priestess Kkikiyou who despite nailing Inuyasha to a tree he somehow has the hots for her. Kagome is supposed to be a reincarnation of her, but she ends up being a completely stoic and poor explained copy of Kagome The problem with all of these possible suitors for the main characters is that it&#039;s painfully obvious who the official couples are so these are just more filler elements the show can pack in.<br />
<br />
The problems don&#039;t stop with the main cast either. It&#039;s a shame, because all of these characters are very likeable but their relationships or personalities are never developed past square one. There&#039;s the best of the bunch, the perverted and scheming monk Miroku who despite his flaws harbors a crush for the demon hunter Sango. He&#039;s also affected by a curse from Naraku that causes his life to be on a doomsday clock but also grants him a hand that is a black hole which ultimately becomes useless because Naraku has more hyper intelligent villainous obscructionist bees than a 2d Donkey kong level.  Sango unfortunately doesn&#039;t have much for anyone to get excited about, she&#039;s a run of the mill human who is useless in combat and who&#039;s only point to being around is for her to get revenge against for her little brother and to serve as crush fodder for Miroku. Of course their relationship goes nowhere because every time Miroku confesses his affection for Sango he goes and screws it up by feeling up random women in the show. There&#039;s also the cute mascot characters of Shippo, Kilala and Myoga the magic flee, but they serve as nothing but beasts of burden or sources of irritation to Inuyasha.<br />
<br />
The worst however, comes from the shows supposedly central relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome. No matter how many times Inuyasha rescues Kagome or Kagome shows her love towards Inuyasha Inuyasha always mucks it up by being a meatheaded jerk and pushing their relationship straight to square one. And that, in a nutshell is what inuyasha&#039;s biggest and unforgivable flaw is. The minor plot elements and characters consist entirely of filler and stock personality types, and the major elements end up being drawn to one sided or inconclusive ends that infuriatingly results in a series that can&#039;t even decide to come to an ending that ties up anything at all! What could have been a breath of fresh air in a stale genre is just banal fodder for anime newbies that don&#039;t know anything better to watch. Really, watch almost anything, it&#039;s shorter and better than this crap.<br />
<br />
Parental Rating – PG-13 – Not too much objectionable here. Some mildly bloody violence from time to time, very mild language (&#039;hell&#039;,&#039;bastard&#039; and &#039;damn&#039;) some adult themes here and there with sexual innuendo&#039;s and some camera obscured James Bond style nudity. And if I&#039;m really grasping at straws, the presence of good and evil demons might rile the feathers of some very religious folk. Nothing here that wouldn&#039;t be fine for mature older children or teens. Though it should probably be considered child abuse to make anyone sit through this 167 episode long tirade of tripe.

    Watching this Anime with my son for the first time (for me and for him) and we are really enjoying it.<br />
<br />
I am watching in Japanese (not using subtitle as Japanese is my 1st language) so my vocabulary may be incorrect.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t watch too many Anime in my own childhood, but since having my own kids, I am making up for it! (I don&#039;t have to finish my homework before screen time anymore:)  It&#039;s great to be a grown up!)<br />
<br />
I think it goes on a bit longer than 167, into &quot;Kanketsu-hen&quot; (Final season).<br />
<br />
InuYasha is totally awesome. I love the way he is simple yet complex,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204680">
        rude yet kind, strong yet fragile. Some of his decision making surprises me. I wish I had Tessaiga to swing around, when life brings unfairness / injustice and all other BS. <br />
<br />
InuYasha and Kagome&#039;s very very slow-moving romance is frustrating, but funny and sweet.  <br />
<br />
Most of the episode are set in Sengoku-period, but some are set in modern Japan. These are basically 100% comedy. I found it hilarious every time InuYasha visited Kagome&#039;s home, especially when he dished out &quot;Kaze no Kizu&quot; at Kagome&#039;s school. <br />
<br />
For me, watching InuYasha do what the hell he likes is energizing and exhilarating, and his romance / rite of passage is heart warming. <br />

    A short review for the reader without much time:<br />
Story (4/10): Repetitive, it&#039;s always about killing some demon, and the demon always gets killed in the same way. Unsatisfying ending.<br />
Art (6/10): The art is probably the only good part of this anime. It is smooth and fairly detailed.<br />
Sound (4/10): Really not much to say.<br />
Character (5/10): I find the characters annoying because they don&#039;t change at all throuhgout the series, and are always up to the same things. The only characters there are are the repetitive main characters or the useless villagers. The only reason this got a 5 was because the character history was pretty good.<br />
Enjoyment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11631">
        (4/10): Enjoyable at first, but then the repetitiveness gets to you.<br />
Overall (5/10)

    Inuyasha has been an anime that I have memed to death, but it has always been near and dear to my heart. Like many, I was one of those kids staying up late and watching it on Adult Swim (when I probably shouldn’t have), and even after all these years, I can still remember key plot points and beloved characters. Now, with the quarantine giving me all this free time, I decided to rewatch the entire series (plus Final Act) for the first time in 10+ years.<br />
<br />
Watching Inuyasha with newer eyes was a worthwhile experience — I have been able to better appreciate Takahashi’s characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339536">
        and the development each of them go through as well as recognize certain parts of the anime that are less than ideal that I didn’t notice as a child.<br />
<br />
I assume you know the plot if you’re reading this and if not, just watch the first few episodes to get a feel. Also for the record, this is my review of the dub. I rarely, if ever, watch subbed anime so sorry if that doesn’t float your boat. Also, this is going to be my review of the anime not including Final Act. I’ll give that one it’s own review when I get to it.<br />
<br />
What really changed this experience of rewatching Inuyasha was my feelings towards the characters; growing up, I was never a big fan of Kagome, our female lead. Looking back on it, I think it was more of my young eyes just not understanding her character arc. As an adult, I adore Kagome. I admire her strength, her courage, and I love the selfless person she is. Kagome was the character who I rooted for the most and watching her grow from a confused, fish out of water into a brave, righteous hero was heartwarming. <br />
<br />
The only time I cried watching this show was when Kagome decided to give up whatever feelings she had for Inuyasha because of how he felt for Kikyo. It’s one of the many examples of Kagome putting others before herself and I’m glad I was able to rid myself of my “I’m not like other girls” mindset to see Kagome for the wonderful protagonist she truly is.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters, I love most of them. I will always love Koga. (or Kouga, depending on the spelling) I looked forward to his episodes because his antics with Inuyasha usually lead to a bit of development between the latter and Kagome. (But I still ship KogKag after all these years)<br />
<br />
Sango was my “best girl” for years before I realized how much I love Kagome. Still, I enjoyed her character arc involving Kohaku — her torn loyalties between her new friends while also wanting to protect her younger brother and Kohaku’s arc as well, blocking out the memories of unknowingly murdering his family due to being under Naraku’s control and then facing bouts of (essentially) PTSD.<br />
(something I didn’t pick up on as a kid) <br />
<br />
I love that Naraku just a villain. Evil incarnate with no redeeming qualities (his name literally means “hell”) There’s no redemption arc for him because he doesn’t deserve it. I don’t know, maybe making a clear villain like that might be lazy writing but there are so many other morally gray characters in the show (Sesshomaru, Kagura, Kikyo) that having the main baddie just being the definition	of pure evil sits right with me.<br />
<br />
For as much as I enjoyed my rewatch there are a few minor grievances. The first (and honestly the MOST minor) are Jaken and Shippo’s voices. I love Shippo as a character, but sometimes his voice really annoyed me especially when he would just yell out the obvious or whine to Kagome. Jaken is a different story. He brought nothing to the story except to praise Sesshomaru and yell at Rin. His voice was extremely shrill and he was CONSTANTLY yelling. You could’ve taken Jaken out and Sesshomaru and Rin’s story would have stayed the same. He literally does nothing for me as a character.<br />
<br />
My second gripe is one I think most people have — the love triangle. Ohhhh the love triangle. Watching Inuyasha constantly go back and forth between Kagome and Kikyo (even after Kagome effectively gave up Inuyasha so he may come to terms with his feelings for Kikyo) was incredibly frustrating and brought to light most of the story’s inconsistencies; in one episode Inuyasha swears to protect Kikyo and even vows to die for her if comes to it. Then, not even ten episodes later while protecting Kagome from Tokajin, Inuyasha nearly dies in the fight and says that he doesn’t care as long as Kagome is safe — what happened to your promise to Kikyo? At points, Inuyasha’s tsundere ways get so frustrating that it made me start to dislike him a bit, especially with my newfound love for Kagome. <br />
<br />
And also...I just hate Kikyo. Don’t get me wrong, she’s a fascinating character, and her arc shows how someone as pure as she once was can become tainted in their path for vengeance. There are multiple instances where she manipulates Inuyasha and takes advantage of Kagome’s selflessness for her own needs. The only person that justifies these actions are Inuyasha, but that’s because he still feels guilt over her death and confuses those feelings with love. Inuyasha isn’t in love with Kikyo; he’s in love with her memory. <br />
<br />
Still, I hate Kikyo. Episodes without her were like mini-vacations for me. But it’s not to the point where I would want her off the show (like Jaken) She’s absolutely needed for the main story and not to further develop Inuyasha and Kagome’s arcs but for her own. One of the best twists in the show is that Naraku’s main target isn’t Inuyasha like what was initially perceived — he’s out to kill Kikyo because her spiritual powers pose a threat to him and Kikyo’s quest for vengeance is, ultimately, a sad one that leads to her second death.<br />
<br />
I think most of my grievances of the show come from its length. At 167 episodes — plus 26 with Final Act totaling to 193 — it’s not the longest anime in the world (looking at the One Pieces and Detective Conans of the world) but for the story it was trying to tell it definitely dragged on at parts. I love that Inuyasha was having an inner conflict with his feelings for Kagome and his unwillingness to let go of Kikyo, it made his more human in his ironic quest to become a full demon. However, due to the number of episodes you have to go through just to get to the end, I kinda just want the show to get to the point. (Like me with this review)<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I’m thankful I made the decision to rewatch Inuyasha. Now, I can truthfully say it’s one of my favorite anime series of all time and I think it’s one that I can recommend to someone who’s willing to take it on. It’s not a masterpiece, there are too many times where the show deviates from the main plot and certain characters that haven’t aged well (sorry, Miroku) But overall, it’s a show with a fairly interesting and engaging plot with characters that have their own motivations and stand out in their own ways.<br />
<br />
It’s probably the best show to watch during a pandemic.

    Inuyasha was the first anime that I had NO complaints about. I enjoyed every second of the series, including the Final Act. I grew attached to characters and stories right from the beginning. Inuyasha perfectly combines romance with shōnen. A lot of anime tend to fail in story and character development when it comes to romantic elements. Inuyasha did an amazing job with both! <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk story: Inuyasha&#039;s simple story to find the sacred jewel shards and defeat Naraku takes many different twists and turns to keep you glued to the screen. Inuyasha is an amazing main character especially when Kagome is at his side.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336854">
        Because of Kagome, Inuyasha is able to go through many changes in character and become more of a dynamic character than his static personality. Kagome taught Inuyasha the importance of love, not just in romance but in friendship as well. At the start of the series, Inuyasha is selfish and only cares about his goal to become a full-fledged demon. Kagome makes him realize that he is perfect the way he is: a half-demon. Inuyasha&#039;s selfish goal turns into a desire to be with Kagome, which was the healthiest decision. <br />
<br />
This anime impacted me significantly! Inuyasha reminded me of myself: a girl who is unhappy with herself and is walking a path of self-isolation and loneliest. Seeing how Kagome changed his life made me believe that there is someone out there who will love me for who I am. Kagome and Inuyasha&#039;s relationship isn&#039;t just fictional; it&#039;s a real journey that can happen to anyone. <br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t seen a single episode of Inuyasha, I recommend you start now. This anime is old now, but it has aged significantly well.

    I am forever confused by Why this anime is so popular and why it went on so long. Friends who have never seen anime get exposed to this first and I always pity them. If you are simple and like easy to understand story where you can jump in at any episode and know what it going on, (like Pokemon) then this anime is for you!<br />
<br />
I admit, I watched the WHOLE anime from start to finish, even some of the movies. I love the beginning with a girl transported from the modern world into another, then finding she had secret powers (Escaflowne-ish); a gang of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15483">
        fun and lovable characters; the wonderful semi-antagonist who you can&#039;t get enough of (Sesshomaru); an impossibly tempting love story with several obstacles; and a plot line set up as a journey. What kept me watching was the possibilities for greatness. <br />
<br />
But this anime turned out to be like walking into a wall over and over again. Other than a few small and nonthreatening antagonists, there was ONE Enemy, ONE objective, and over 69 hours of disappointment. The finale episode made me scream at the screen, and so I watched the movies to scream at the screen even more as NEITHER offered climax or closure!!! I finally went to the manga to see if it ever offered me an ending, reading only the last few chapters (It does if you want to know).    <br />
<br />
A Note: <br />
Many will go on about how much they love Sesshomaru, b/c he was the ONLY character that developed at all: starting out as evil big brother, then saves a little girl, takes care of her, etc. (see manga around ch 470 for cool Sess-Rin stuff, and finale chapter 558 of course too). But he is not enough to save the whole show, he&#039;s not in enough of it.

    TL;DR: Inuyasha is a nostalgia blast with many good points and an engrossing story. I would recommend this show to pretty much everyone.<br />
<br />
L;DR:<br />
Watching Inuyasha makes me feel nostalgic. That’s something a lot of people who love Inuyasha will say; many people grew up watching this show on Adult Swim into the wee hours of the morning, and in this way Inuyasha is special to many people.<br />
I am not one of those people.<br />
But, Inuyasha has this special quality that makes it feel nostalgic. The first time I watched this show was semi-recently but I instantly felt a connection. It wasn’t necessarily because the show was outstanding,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325936">
        mind you. But something- be it the music, dubbing, the characters, the animation, something about it gave such a nostalgic quality. Something made me see this anime and go, “Ah. It’s a classic”<br />
And honestly, it is a classic. It was also my first introduction to the Rumiko Takahashi, the mangaka who I would go on to become a huge fan of.<br />
So, review time. I&#039;ll break it up like this.<br />
<br />
(BEWARE OF SPOILERS!) I&#039;ll try to keep them to a minimum but you might see a few.<br />
<br />
TALKING STORY<br />
Inuyasha&#039;s plotline is basic in concept, as it follows a pretty standard shonen formula. I will be honest, though, it got a little difficult for me to really keep tabs on everything going on towards the latter parts of the show. That may just be my fault, though, as I often would put Inuyasha on as a background show to watch during homework or video games. Even if the show is &quot;formulaic,&quot; I still think it has its own merits. For instance, Rumiko Takahashi, queen of the romance comedy, crafted a great romance plot. And as romance-filled as the show is, it&#039;s also a darn good shonen. The action scenes, to my plebeian eyes, seemed well done and easy to follow (I can sometimes get lost during action scenes so this is a big thing for me). There&#039;s a clear goal for the characters to aim for, and it&#039;s set up in a way that allows for a lot of different plot lines to converge. Even the filler wasn&#039;t too bad for the most part. Storywise, Inuyasha has something for everyone. Good action, solid romance, interesting villains and demons, some good comedic elements, and the Feudal Japan setting is extremely atmospheric.<br />
<br />
You do have to suspend your disbelief to watch this show. Like, how Kagome&#039;s sailor uniform which she for some reason wears is always clean? Or the logistics of managing life between two worlds? There&#039;s a lot of little things to pick apart here, but honestly, I didn&#039;t think about it too much (and usually I always am!).<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
I really liked the character designs in Inuyasha. A good way to tell if a character design is good is to look at a silhouette of the character, and see how iconic it is. For example, if I saw a silhouette of the main cast, it would be easy to pick apart who is who. The colors work well for the most part. About the characters themselves, they&#039;re all likable and have their own motives and backstories. There was never a moment where I went &quot;that doesn&#039;t seem like something they would do/say&quot;. Sometimes Kagome can get annoying, but I also don&#039;t really blame her. Every character trope is filled, but not in an obvious or shoehorned way.<br />
<br />
BANGER SOUNDTRACK<br />
It is a banger. All of the openings are jammable (never once skipped!). Side note, if you watch on Netflix, they for some reason didn&#039;t include the opening &quot;Change the World&quot; which is the best and most iconic one. So please, please, listen to that if you plan on watching via Netflix. The background music is also awesome. The lullabies make me cry every time, too, and &quot;To Love&#039;s End&quot; was the first melody I learned for the piano. I listen to the complete soundtrack on Spotify all the time while doing homework. Good stuff.<br />
<br />
CONTROVERSIALLY, I LIKE THE DUB<br />
When I was first getting into anime, that was around the time I started Inuyasha, too. At this point of my weeb journey I generally liked to watch dubs instead, simply because it was easier to multitask that way. I do think that the dub was well casted, and though it might not be objectively on the same level as dubs such as Death Note, it is certainly packed full of charm. A few things are off about the dub, like how the pronunciation of characters&#039; names range from alright to downright cringey, or how the reusing of voice actors is extremely obvious when multiple minor characters have the same voice. But there was a pretty good cast, some notable voices include: Inuyasha, Sesshomaru (very hot voice... am I allowed to say that?), Sango and Miroku, and even Shippo. I was iffy about Kagome&#039;s voice at first but once I got used to it, I think she actually encapsulated her pretty well.<br />
<br />
Also, I listened to many clips of the original audio and it sounds great! I definitely foresee myself rewatching the show in the future with the sub.<br />
<br />
BONUS: DRINKING GAME<br />
This part here is a little joke, but this seems a good place to write about a few frustrating parts of the show, namely, certain tropes and scenes that were repeated over the course of the show to an extremely noticeable point. If you&#039;re feeling brave, maybe try and take a shot every time one of these things comes up.<br />
- Inuyasha and Kagome screaming each others&#039; names<br />
- an illusion in which a character is placed into a non-real world<br />
- Kagome getting kidnapped/held hostage <br />
- Kikyo falling off a cliff <br />
- Character being put under trance and then, by power of sheer will/friendship/love manage to break out of the trance. Likely followed by a villain saying &quot;How are you awake? Impossible!&quot;<br />
- Inuyasha becoming full demon and only being able to be brought back by Kagome<br />
<br />
