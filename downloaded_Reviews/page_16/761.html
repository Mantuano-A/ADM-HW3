    *This review contains spoilers*<br />
<br />
I had such high hopes for Wonder Egg Priority. I praised its first few episodes like it would be the best anime of the year. If only I could go back in time and prepare myself for a massive disappointment.<br />
<br />
Before someone tells me, &quot;You didn&#039;t understand the symbolism and metaphors.&quot; I understood it, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as deep as people say. The symbolism is either so blatant you barely need to do any thinking or so vague that it becomes pretentious. It&#039;s like watching a movie while the director is breathing down your neck, telling you what every symbol, line

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388278">
        of dialogue, and gesture means. <br />
<br />
In my eyes, the most underwhelming art is the kind that tells you exactly how to interpret it; though writers can break this rule successfully, it must be purposeful. Wonder Egg didn&#039;t ignore subtlety for a reason, and it did it because it&#039;s simpler to spell everything out. The viewer can feel instant gratification for understanding a symbol, which inspires us to dig deeply into the vague and nonsensical parts—leading to theory crafting to excuse the show&#039;s writing flaws. With only thirteen episodes, one being a recap and the thirteenth airing months later, the series bit off far more than it could chew. If we ignore everything except Wonder Egg&#039;s movie-like technical qualities, it is a masterpiece. Scratch off the paint, and underneath, all you&#039;ll find is hack writing exploiting people with mental illnesses and trauma. <br />
<br />

Spoilers incoming, but you&#039;ll thank me later because you won&#039;t have to sit through the show to discover its idiotic twists. I&#039;ll try to explain the show to those of you whose brains died trying to understand what was supposed to be the hamfisted twist near the end. Trigger warnings include suicide, self-harm, pedophilia, child abuse, and sexual assault.<br />

Entering Wonder Egg, I had no expectations. They hardly advertised it, and the plot summary was mysterious. &quot;The story of four girls who find eggs.&quot; It sounded intriguing. From the start, it introduced our main character, a 14-year-old girl with two different colored eyes. She was cleverly named Ohto Ai. While aimlessly wandering through her town, Ai finds an egg with numbers stamped on it. What could it possibly be? When Ai falls asleep, she enters a dream world that resembles her middle school. Things immediately become dire as an invisible man yells at her to break the egg—once she cracks the shell, it expands and breaks to reveal a girl was inside.<br />
<br />
Angry CGI gnomes wielding knives chase after the two girls. These creatures are named &quot;seeno evils&quot; because they symbolize any bystander who allowed bullying or harassment; this is the kind of on-the-nose symbolism the show is known for, rather than designing a creature that conveys the idea. The writer just named it the thing because it&#039;s easier. The seeno evils wear demonic masks, wielding knives, and leave a blood-red paint trail, like generic horror game monsters. Monsters can physically harm Ai within the dream world—those wounds won&#039;t go away when she wakes up, similar to the horror classic A Nightmare on Elm Street. The dream world has a final boss called a &quot;Wonder Killer&quot; representing the person who tormented the &#039;egg girl&#039; in the real world—they are an oversimplification of cruel adults: abusers, pedophiles, stalkers, and other creeps. There&#039;s no nuance to them, don&#039;t expect complex villains. Ai assists the girl by clobbering the monstrosities with a large colorful sword resembling a Kingdom Hearts weapon. The girl who Ai rescues has a name, but you won&#039;t remember it because, as every egg girl, she is present for half an episode at most and given the bare minimum characterization. <br />
<br />
This is Wonder Egg&#039;s plot structure; in most episodes, Ai, or one of her three friends who later get introduced, enters a dream world to save an egg girl from their tormenter. Every egg girl is 14-years-old and a suicide victim. The heroines, Ai, Neiru, Rika, and Momoe, defend the egg girls to resurrect a friend who committed suicide. Every girl they protect brings them closer to achieving their goal. Each girl&#039;s dreamscapes are the location where their friend, or family, passed away. The victims are represented by a statue, frozen in place moments before their death. The girls buy the eggs from two mannequin men who call themselves Accas; they explain various aspects of the dream world to create an internal logic; that way, it doesn&#039;t feel like an asspull when a character jumps 30 feet in the air. The Accas are the author&#039;s mouthpiece because he cannot trust us to think on our own. Their gender essentialist philosophy makes them unreliable allies, and that&#039;s welcomed character depth. However, their ideologies are never criticized within the story. Instead, they are reified. One of their gender essentialist quotes goes as follows: &quot;Boys&#039; and girls&#039; suicides mean different things. Men are goal-oriented, women are emotion-oriented. Women are impulsive and easily influenced by others&#039; voices.&quot; This is blatantly untrue, and suggesting otherwise is stupid and harmful. <br />
<br />
The heroines struggle with personal turmoil, such as forbidden love, grief, regret, self-loathing, and more. Throughout their interactions with the egg girls and conquering trauma, they confront their problems. While a shallow, one-dimensional archetype, each dream&#039;s Wonder Killer is animated beautifully and brought to life with the best fights in TV anime. The production is on par with Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer. Though the egg girls are suicide victims, there isn&#039;t enough time to shape them into real people, so Wonder Egg uses a tactic to make us care for them. Designing a cute character design. There&#039;s no need to write a deep character when you can make her cute then say, &quot;She committed suicide,&quot; or &quot;She was abused.&quot; It has the same effect as putting an adorable puppy in a depressing situation—you&#039;d be a monster if you didn&#039;t feel sympathy for it. If you want to scare the audience straight, then it works purely on the basis of the shock factor, like a stunningly animated Public Service Announcement. But you have to admit, PSAs aren&#039;t very well written.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, throwing in sensitive topics such as mental illness, suicide, and writers must handle sexual assault with respect and care. Wonder Egg treats them with the sensitivity of a sledgehammer. It doesn&#039;t feel deserved when the director throws in shots of a girl&#039;s dead body, with her head smashed into a splatter of blood on the pavement. It&#039;s overly indulgent. One of the worst scenes showed a one-off character getting raped on screen. The writer plays with fire, not caring who he burns in the process. It&#039;s no surprise that Wonder Egg&#039;s loudest critics are the ones who&#039;ve experienced the trauma that it brazenly uses to startle the audience. Gratuitous violence and high-quality art does not make a story deeper. Trying to excuse the meticulous attention to detail put into drawing a dead girl&#039;s foot only leads to pretentious navel-gazing.  <br />
<br />
Wonder Egg has mastered the art of emotional manipulation in this way. Of course, I am not saying you cannot make depressing stories featuring cute girls. Look at Madoka Magica, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Princess Tutu. They deal with suicide, sexual assault, death, and other heavy topics. Not to mention, the show copied Madoka&#039;s spirit gems which the girls use to summon adorable Pokemon-like guardians. Wonder Egg&#039;s issue is that it doesn&#039;t have enough time to make its extraneous characters more than two-dimensional victims, and its understanding of mental illness is shallow. If you take away the cute character designs, odds are people would have a much harder time sympathizing with them. Each egg girl describes their reason for suicide; some bold-facedly says, &quot;I was repeatedly assaulted.&quot; <br />
<br />
The script is so awkwardly alien it feels like you&#039;re watching a PSA or an afterschool special for teenagers, rather than believable people with trauma. Perhaps they grew weary of writing suicide victims who resemble real people, reflecting problems with society and the economy, because most of the egg girls state they committed suicide for ridiculous reasons. Such as, &#039;I want to be with my dead pop idol,&quot; &quot;The ghosts told me to,&quot; and &quot;I did it because my cult leader said so.&quot; Although it could happen in real life, they far surpass the point of relatability. I&#039;d almost laugh if it weren&#039;t so exploitative of people who cope with mental illness and suicidal thoughts. It&#039;s astonishing how quickly the show desensitizes you to suicide; it becomes so inconsequential that Ai straight-up asks an egg girl why she killed herself, no preamble. The girl said she saw ghosts—so Ai thought it was appropriate to reference The Sixth Sense. The whole thing gets played off as a joke. Suicide. Joke. What is the correlation? Do you see how this is a total nightmare? It appeals to the same kind of people who disingenuously say they like &quot;Dark humor&quot; when they only want to offend people in reality.<br />
<br />
On the other side, the main characters have plenty more time for development. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the most fleshed-out character of the four was Rika. Her story is one of redemption. Despite being young, she was a junior idol who dealt with fans regularly. Her biggest fan was Cheimi, a girl who spent all her money on seeing Rika and giving her gifts. Eventually, Rika discovered the girl was shoplifting to afford gifts, so she made an irrational decision to stop her. She insulted the girl by saying she could never be friends with a fan and would be &quot;Embarrassed to be seen with a fatty.&quot; Cheimi developed an eating disorder and died after starving herself to death. She said the cruel things seemed to reveal what Rika thought; they weren&#039;t just made-up insults to make Chiemi leave. We saw her, and she was a big girl, then she starved herself because Rika body-shamed her. There are plenty of good ways to prevent a fan from visiting an idol. Insulting them isn&#039;t one. But Rika understands the weight of her actions. Driving Chiemi to suicide leaves Rika regretful and self-loathing; she reflects on these emotions as she cuts herself with a razor beside a mirror. Do you get it? She is self-reflecting, next to a mirror. The MIRROR is a SYMBOL for her self-reflection. Seemingly to mock us, Rika&#039;s weapon is a giant box cutter. She cuts herself with a box cutter, a weapon she uses against herself to fight her trauma. Do you get it? Shall I explain it to you again? <br />
<br />
In the seventh episode, Rika&#039;s character arc peaks. She confronts her feelings of self-loathing on her birthday while searching for a father she never met. The problem with this episode wasn&#039;t just the unsubtle symbolism. It is how Rika&#039;s self-harm gets treated. Clearly, she self-harms to cope with things—and it bothered me how the episode framed Rika stopping self-harming as positive growth. It&#039;s a good thing she stops, even if she relapses, but that&#039;s typically not how it is in real life. I&#039;ll admit I went through a period in my life that I self-harmed to cope with a difficult circumstance. And I&#039;d be lying if I said it goes away entirely—even after years of treatment. Framing it as a step in her character development ladder is dismissive rather than a long and challenging process. It shows a lack of understanding on the part of the writer. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the most questionable part of Rika&#039;s character arc was how a few times it is implied that Rika had sex with adults, but why? The probable answer is that the story restricted itself to a mere eleven episodes. Why would they include such a harmful topic like pedophilia concerning a central character, then not address it at all? One could argue the dream world allows Rika to conquer her inner demons, ala the Person franchise, which is true, but not enough to justify an unnecessary and painful aspect. <br />
<br />
Within the dreams, the girls are stronger, but their injuries stay when they wake up. Rika got a giant cut on her arm in the seventh episode, but it disappeared when she woke up. The internal logic seems to fall apart whenever it&#039;s convenient. They attempted to make rules in the first few episodes: Kill the monster, save the girl, then once the bell rings, it ends. That&#039;s not longer important. The heroines use anything as a super-powered weapon, not just their designated swords or guns. Though I was frustrated with Rika&#039;s mental illness&#039;s poor handling, her mother&#039;s relationship was perhaps the most empathetic part of the show. The end of her episode had a poignant message; love your parents, if they&#039;re worth it.<br />
<br />
I want to praise the show for Momoe Sawaki, one of the few respectful portrayals of a transgender character in anime. She confronts true-to-life problems transgender people face integrating into society as her true gender. Her friend fell in love with her, but Momoe &quot;Got scared and pushed her away&quot; because she was uncomfortable. Note, it wasn&#039;t anyone&#039;s fault. Inevitably, this led the girl to suicide; This is one of Momoe&#039;s most significant obstacles. Her egg girls are all lesbians in the dream world, or they mistake her for a man, except for one. I wouldn&#039;t say I like how the show portrays its only lesbian interactions as predatory. Still, it could be worse. They&#039;re attracted to her because she appears handsome and dresses masculinely, despite being feminine on the inside. The Wonder Killers that Momoe fights are typically pedophiles; her fights are symbolic for her claiming her true gender and rejecting the patriarchy. Her dream worlds were perhaps the most straight-forward. <br />
<br />
There was a time I didn&#039;t like her, though. In the bowling alley, Momoe jokingly said, if you don&#039;t let us bowl, &quot;We might kill ourselves without it.&quot; I dislike people who joke about killing themselves to get what they want—even though they exist among highly privileged people. Chances are this won&#039;t bother most people, but it is a major annoyance for me; whoever wrote this joke should&#039;ve considered talking to real people with mental illness. It&#039;s another unfortunate reminder that Wonder Egg doesn&#039;t understand the people that it&#039;s story is about—rather it has the understanding of a parent&#039;s obtuse understanding of their depressed child. Momoe is wholly unlike Neiru, the most complicated of the four heroines.<br />
<br />
Neiru Aonuma is a quiet and reserved super-genius who owns a company. She was created in a lab, has no parents, and no friends except a comatose girl. Her circumstances are so unbelievable I found her the hardest one to relate to; she seemed to belong in a Sci-Fi show. Her sister stabbed her, then jumped off a bridge. The reason why she is fighting in the egg world is to forget her sister. It&#039;s not until episode nine that she becomes outwardly unlikeable. She invites her friends to her home (part of her company&#039;s building), introduces them to her comatose friend, then says she&#039;ll unplug her life support right now. Of course, her friends are distraught. They don&#039;t want to watch someone die. In response, Neiru says, &quot;I didn&#039;t… ask you to take a field trip here.&quot; No, she did ask them to come; she just wasn&#039;t honest about why. The writer rushed the whole thing. It introduced new concepts and far-fetched ideas; they showed that the Accas could record the dreams, Neiru&#039;s Plati society&#039;s existence, and its ambiguous connection to the Accas. As it rushed through content, it became apparent there would only be one season. If you don&#039;t understand what&#039;s happening by the eighth episode, don&#039;t worry; the recap explains all of the symbolism for you. <br />
<br />
Comparatively, Ai received less development despite being the primary character. Her friend Koito committed suicide due to bullying—a typical sad story told in many PSAs geared towards kids. Her classmates harassed Koito because her teacher Mr. Sawaki gave her &#039;special treatment.&#039; Due to the show&#039;s prevalent theme of not trusting adults, it is glaringly obvious that Mr. Sawaki is a suspicious figure. He&#039;s dating Ai&#039;s mom to get closer to her; Ai saw him getting intimate with Koito, so she has been awkward around him, and now she suddenly likes him for unclear reasons. The thing that bothers me about Ai&#039;s relationship with Sawaki is that he blatantly grooms her—like the other young girls who are in love with male adults (And yes, this becomes a trend), it seems irrational. Ai is the quiet outsider, allowing the audience an avatar to connect with the fantastical setting. The truth is, we don&#039;t have enough details to enter her headspace, unlike the other girls. When Ai saw how Sawaki painted Koito, she associated it with their mutual love. Ai believed if Sawaki painted her, they would form a similar bond. Their problematic relationship gets promptly brushed past until the twelfth episode to make room for the other characters, lore dumps, and unnecessary exposition. In episode twelve, Ai confronted different versions of herself from other worlds and predictably fought Sawaki in the dream world. The writers introduced totally new concepts and ignored previously established logic. They aimed for a profound conclusion like Evangelion&#039;s final episode but it landed closer to Darling in The FranXX&#039;s clusterfuck of an ending.<br />
<br />
By the eleventh episode, Wonder Egg jumped the shark. It added an entirely new villain, a schoolgirl with the head of a butterfly, and it replaced meandering dialogue with gory ultra-violence. Episode eleven shifts perspective to developing the two Accas. You know. Because they&#039;re important, right? Their backstory focuses on their lives as scientists; for no reason whatsoever, they created an artificial human girl. Somehow the show ripped off both the Matrix and Ghost in The Shell in one scene. <br />
<br />
The girl looked like a hideous bleached raisin. Less than a minute later, it turned into a 14-year-old girl, designed to look and act painfully adorable. She names herself Frill. In a better show, they&#039;d use this as an opportunity to critique the male writer/director for designing a dozen cute female characters with prepackaged traits to be readily marketable. But no, the two men raise Frill for a couple of years, then they neglect her. She develops a mental illness, murders one of the guy&#039;s wife, and consequently, they throw her in a basement for years. Acca physically beats the girl on screen, and it gets framed as though she deserved it. However, it was he who created then neglected her. The show implied she caused Acca&#039;s daughter to commit suicide, gratuitously shown on screen. With no logical evidence, the man grabs Frill and burns her to death. The anime added her for two reasons: To show how the Accas are bad guys (which we already knew), and for sadistic entertainment that&#039;s more befitting a series like Magical Girl Site. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t even get to the part about Frill controlling the dream world all along. At the last minute, it is all revealed to be a simulation designed to torture young girls. What is the message here? Don&#039;t create artificial life and let two mansplainers raise it? Beyond faux-intellectual theory crafting, there&#039;s no value in this exercise in futility. To any audience members with mental illnesses, I strongly advise you to avoid this like the plague. If you want to feel shocked, disgusted, and insulted, this is a good choice. <br />
<br />
Wonder Egg Priority was a passion project created by young aspiring artists from across the world. Frankly, their work paid off because this is one of the best animated TV anime I&#039;ve ever seen. Due to the pandemic, the staff worked remotely, but the lack of management led to them working far past their deadlines with little to no pay—even causing staff members to need hospitalization. Ironically, Cloverworks is a horrible studio that exploited young artists to create an anime ABOUT cruel and untrustworthy adults. The final episode will get released in a few months because the studio tortured its staff, but no polished animation will make-up for this show&#039;s deeply ingrained flaws. <br />
<br />
Edit: I watched the final episode and it was horrid. It somehow made the show even worse. Do not watch it, just let the original ending be one of life&#039;s little mysteries!

    This anime reminds me of an art-house film. One very specific art-house film - Garden State. The one about which a classic said, “If cancer were pretentious, it would be Garden State.” Wonder Egg Priority with its bumbling attempts to be profound invokes the same familiar feeling of a student movie way over its head.<br />
<br />
“The MC’s name is Ohto Ai because she has an Odd Eye, did you get it?”<br />
“What could this giant close-up of a lily flower possibly mean in an anime about teen girls, wink, wink?”<br />
“These monsters that look like faceless schoolgirls that throw axes at another schoolgirl and scribble ‘die’ on her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377322">
        locker are actually a subtle metaphor for school bullying.”<br />
“And now the MC that pretended to not notice the above-mentioned bullying is being chased by monsters called Seenoevils, what amazing symbolism!”<br />
<br />
And that’s only from the first five minutes of the first episode! Wonder Egg Priority? More like Wonder Eggs and Ham Priority, amirite? Because of how *ham-fisted* this molestation of the concept of symbolism is, get it? I, too, am a master of symbology.<br />
<br />
I don’t mean to imply that this show is all bad. At least it does a very good job of predicting what kind of an audience would be impressed by this metaphor fiesta, and how much spoon-feeding that audience would need in order to understand what is even going on (hint: all of it). There is not a single metaphor that isn’t helpfully explained by an exposition dump. How do we know that those monsters are called Seenoevils? A character spells it out. How do we know that the MC was pretending to not notice the bullying? A character spells it out. How do we know that the whole sequence happens in a dream? A character spells it out.<br />
<br />
I could continue to criticize other scenes in order of appearance, but it’s actually the opposite of what I’m trying to do with this early preview. What I’m trying to do is a PSA - we’ve had plenty of these kinds of anime series before - with “symbolism” the only deep meaning of which was the fact that their authors struggled with literature classes in high school and never quite got this whole metaphor deal. We’ve had Flip Flappers. We’ve had Darling in the Franxx. Those, too, were initially praised by the crowd (despite being awful from their first seconds) - only to implode into laughably incoherent messes that even the uninformiest of fans were able to recognize as not very good by the end. Do yourself a favor and drop this one early.<br />

    IN SUMMARY: gorgeous visuals, incredible animation, good OST, spot-on voice acting, a compelling interesting story, no senseless fan service - so far, this show has been really good 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
-Gorgeous visuals which are almost on the same level as anime movies (my only complain is the 3d knife-wielding leprechauns, which, to be honest, still look good)<br />
<br />
-Incredible super fluid sakuga (that episode 2 fight animation was simply godlike; even outside of fights, the animation is so freaking beautiful and fluid). Probably the best thing about this anime<br />
<br />
-Good fitting OST and sound usage<br />
<br />
-The voice acting is spot on - it&#039;s not your usual super high pitched animesque girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377303">
        voice. When the MC screams you can hear the coarseness in her voice, it&#039;s just really satisfying<br />
<br />
-The story is captivating and there&#039;s this whole mystery behind it, which always keeps you wondering what the hell is happening. *Episode 1 and 2 slight spoilers* The plot delves into dark topics and the overall theme of the story revolves around the MC trying to redeem herself by helping others, in order to save her friend whom she once &quot;betrayed&quot;. The story setting alternates between 2 places: the real world and the alternate world, something similar to a silent hill like world where there are bizarre and dangerous creatures<br />
<br />
-The characters all have their respective backgrounds and inner demons, and aren&#039;t one dimensional nor stereotypical<br />
<br />
-No senseless fan service, thank god they didn&#039;t give into temptation. I&#039;m not against ecchi, but damn, the number of shows with great potential that are ruined by out of context panty shots, gravity defying boob physics, huge disgustingly perverted MCs (looking at you, Mushoku Tensei with your 35 year old MC fawning over and grooming pre-teen girls)<br />
<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg has been amazing so far. Hope it can keep up the great quality

    This review mentions sexual assault, self-harm, and suicide.<br />
<br />
I have rewatched Wonder Egg Priority multiple times in an effort to organize my conflicting feelings towards it. On one hand, it has beautiful visuals, an intriguing aura, and a great first couple episodes. On the other hand, it has shallow concepts, a messy narrative, a lack in direction, problematic messages, poor character development, exploitation of sensitive themes, and a failed execution of ideas. Yeah, the cons definitely outweigh the pros with this one.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg markets itself as an odd yet beautiful dream of self-acceptance full of imagery and symbolism. The first scene of the anime introduces us

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388280">
        to our protagonist, Ai, in the middle of the street when a strange voice taking form of a firefly brings her to an underground arcade and gives her an egg. Breaking the egg transports Ai to a surreal world that slowly reveals itself as a danger zone where she is tasked to protect a person called a “Wonder” from a creature called a “Wonder Killer”, a representation of the person’s struggles or trauma. Ai then meets friends who also take part on their own journeys to defeat Wonder Killers. Every character has their own backstory and a set of convictions that affect how they act and fight against trauma. It’s a very original and mysterious Ikuhara-esque concept that aims to tackle how we overcome our issues. But with each episode, the anime gets more and more problematic until it completely falls apart.<br />
<br />
One of Wonder Egg’s main fallbacks is its use of imagery. Ironically, imagery is the whole appeal of the show and the reason why I admittedly had high hopes for it. But over time, it got repetitive, and I realized that it was due to the constricted nature by which imagery in Wonder Egg is presented.<br />
<br />
The wonder killers (victim’s trauma) are always actual beings. There’s the abusive teacher, the abusive teacher #2, the abusive coach, and so on. Not only is this the same thing over and over again, but I find this pattern problematic because when we talk about sensitive topics like self-harm and suicide in real life, trauma doesn’t always take form of one specific event or attacker.<br />
<br />
We can see how this issue affects the story in one of the episodes that focuses on Momoe, a tomboyish girl learning to deal with society’s ideas of gender and appearance. Fitting with the theme, the person Momoe was tasked to save in that episode was a non-conforming girl who identified as a boy. This is great. Having Momoe pair up with someone who is also subjected to society’s standards is a very thematic plot choice that allows the opportunity for Momoe to maybe learn something about herself from their encounter. I thought, “Cool, so this whole dream sequence is going to focus on how they accept themselves despite societal pressures.” Perhaps the wonder killer would be a representation of society that they could beat together.<br />
<br />
But no. Instead, the Wonder Killer was a rapist… which I found completely random. Yes, rape is an issue. But is it a good issue to poorly tie into the topic of gender norms for no deep reason? Absolutely not. Why suddenly insert a rapist when the topic isn’t about dealing with rape? Doing this just feels like the show is forcibly inserting rapists everywhere. It also feels a lot like the show is just digressing from the initial topic at hand.<br />
<br />
If Wonder Egg wants to tackle challenging societal norms, then the issue should be society itself. But this anime consistently uses one specific attacker to encompass the whole issue. In doing this, it only focuses on face-value encounters and makes it seem like the entire problem lies within just one superficial enemy or trauma. It is a wasted opportunity that hinders Wonder Egg from using imagery in a broader way. Had they used the dream sequence in order to symbolize society and its issues as a whole, the anime would have better succeeded in connecting to the bigger picture. Instead, Wonder Egg’s imagery is too narrow, relying on a single person to put the blame on.<br />
<br />
Object symbolism in this anime doesn&#039;t come with much meaning either. The firefly from the first episode is seen every once and while but doesn’t represent anything. It could’ve been any other bug or small object, and everything would’ve remained the same. Ai has heterochromia which is supposed to show how different she is and tie into the fact that she was made fun of in school. But then the anime contradicts this symbolism by introducing another character with heterochromia who was considered smart and beautiful rather than someone who was made fun of. All of the main girls have different weapons when they enter the dream world, and the show even draws attention to this when Ai first fights a wonder killer with one of her friends. But the weapons barely catered to their backgrounds OR only referenced one small part about their personality. It would be easy to assume that the creators just randomly gave them something cool that would look good with their character design. For the most part, this isn’t a huge issue. But it’s disappointing because the anime sets itself up to be something deeper and because most of these ideas take place in a dream world that’s supposed to be some representation of reality. I love analyzing and reading between the lines, and I thought that Wonder Egg would make me do that with its unusual concepts. But it’s mostly just pseudo-symbolic repetition without thought.<br />
<br />
Despite this shallow repetition and narrow imagery, the girls-fighting-against-wonder-killers formula was still a solid one that produced decent results in the beginning of the anime. We got to see girls be badass and overcome their trauma. Everything was running smoothly, and there weren’t any big plot issues. But that’s exactly why when Wonder Egg abandoned this formula, the narrative completely collapsed.<br />
<br />
For some reason, the creators of the anime couldn’t stick to one idea. So before we even hit halfway through the series, they started playing around with the messages of the anime. One line that shifted the tone of the narrative was “Boys’ and girls’ suicides mean different things. Men are goal-oriented, and women are emotion-oriented. Women are impulsive and easily influenced by others’ voices.” Suddenly, Wonder Egg was no longer a show that focused on girls simply to show their growth and strength. It became a show that focused on girls because apparently ‘they’re emotional and easily manipulated’. Tying those stereotypical ideas into suicide was a horrible choice. The show tries to make sense of it later on in the anime, but it just ends up being rushed. So the lines came off like something that the writers genuinely believed in.<br />
<br />
A lot of the smaller dialogue started relying on similar gender stereotypes as well. For example, some quotes from the anime are “Men who ask women for money are all fake” and “A beautiful woman never needs a wallet.” Both of these lines come from Rika, one of Ai’s friends who is involved in acts of self-harm and lives in a single-parent-household with an alcoholic mother. Knowing this, I assume that the dialogue was meant to show the mindset of a child from a troubled home with absent parental figures. However, I don’t understand why they had to be so stereotypical. There are multiple other ways to display a person’s mindset without having to rely on problematic dialogue. The fact that these messages are repeated throughout the show makes it feel like the anime is exploiting Rika’s background and using these lines more as shock factor rather than to show her growth. This is even more evident when Rika implies that she hasn’t gained a sense of self-acceptance.<br />
<br />
After one of her Wonder Killer battles, Rika says “Even if it means hurting myself, I’m going to live.” Anyone who knows how dangerous self-harm can be should understand why this line is a big issue. Not only did the anime actively promote self-harm, but it also marketed it as growth.<br />
<br />
Now I like to give shows the benefit of the doubt, so I thought that the line might have just been a part of the story. Maybe the anime is self-aware of how incorrect it is and is only using it to build bigger themes. I tried to think of it as a means for Rika’s characterization to maybe emphasize her troubled background. But I recently rewatched that episode and saw no indication of that line having a deeper connection to Rika’s family life. In fact, that line was part of the last episode of the series that fully focused on Rika, so the anime never clears up the way it poorly handled self-harm. Though I’ve tried to think positively, I cannot find anything to justify that piece of scriptwriting. It blatantly views self-harm in a positive light to the point that I can no longer call this an anime about self-acceptance. <br />
<br />
The creators also began flooding the show with too many ideas and cheap plot twists, most of which were crammed towards the end of the anime where the writers didn’t have enough time to cover them all. New antagonists and backstories were introduced in the last few episodes of the series, unnecessary changes to the storyline happened at every corner, and random events were inserted just for the sake of shock value rather than actual relevance to the overarching plot. <br />
<br />
Wonder Egg even introduces inter-relational conflicts that never get fully explored. One example of this is with Neiru, one of Ai’s friends. Neiru has a tense relationship with her sister, and when she tells Ai about this, we learn about the sequence of events that led to their complex sisterhood. But the details were incomplete. The anime set it up as a mystery to unfold as the story went along. What really happened? Why did her sister act the way that she did? Even after watching all twelve episodes of the anime, I still don’t know. The show just brings up the issue but never resolves it.<br />
<br />
When I expressed these concerns, fans argued that there would be more episodes or at least more content to close things up properly. Though a special broadcast in June has been announced, I highly doubt that the franchise will be able to tackle all of the issues found in the anime and tie all the loose strings together in a twenty-minute episode. The storyline is already a mess and there would be too many relationships to cover. This is a clear production, time management, and story building mistake on the studio’s part. And the need for a special broadcast only emphasizes their shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Amidst all of these flaws, I admit that there are still some things Wonder Egg does well. For example, the directing really stands out in some of the quieter scenes of the anime. From the moment we’re introduced to Ai and the world of Wonder Egg Priority, there’s this calming aura of quiet eeriness that pulls you in. The atmosphere is immersive and will keep you hooked to find out what happens next in the series.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg also has stunning visuals. The animation looks like it came straight out of KyoAni with consistent and fluid drawings. The color palette is unique with bold colors that grab your attention, and the artists use this with a good understanding of contrast and tone. Flexible and eye-catching, Wonder Egg’s art is one of the few parts of the anime that remained consistent throughout its twelve-episode-run. Paired with the messy plotline, some may call Wonder Egg an anime that chooses style over substance. And they aren’t wrong.<br />
<br />
Looking at it as a whole, Wonder Egg was an imperfect but cool idea that ended up being too ambitious for its own good. It introduced too many plot points without properly bringing them together which affected the messaging and made the show feel less cohesive. While watching this anime, I often found myself wondering whether the creators even knew what they were doing. It seemed like they couldn’t decide the direction that they wanted to go, so they just let the story jump around until they found something that evoked some sort of emotion from the audience. It’s messy writing that falls short in multiple aspects of story building and fails to connect to the initial topic of self-acceptance. Putting aside the solid beginning and fun visuals, I can’t find much to recommend about this show. And though I’m frustrated that we’ll never see how this anime could’ve gone with proper execution, I’ll probably just remember it as another one of CloverWorks’ cringeworthy letdowns this season.<br />
<br />

    It has been a long time since an original anime truly pushed the bounds of the medium and really diverged from standard cookie cutter series. Wonder Egg Priority is not only original in that it has no source material, its original in that its concept has rarely been done before in any other anime series. If you have long been awaiting an anime with a dark magical girl atmosphere similar to that of Madoka or Flip Flappers, along with Mawaru Penguindrum style character designs and color pallets, with all the symbolism included of course, then this is a must check anime from the 2021 winter

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388186">
        season. This review will delve into why Wonder Egg Priority stands out among anime originals and why it is a contender for anime of the season even among one of the most stacked anime seasons in years.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
Initially the premise seems like the backstory for a high school set drama, however this quickly shifts during the first episode. At the start the protagonist, Ai Ooto, goes full hikkikomori due to personal issues, some of the issues include a close friend committing suicide and Ooto generally being ostracized while at school. She lives her days full of regret and dreaming about her friend, Ooto knows she should have stood up her for her friend who was being bullied, especially since it was because her friend protected her that she became a target. All of this is just the prologue to the actual story which begins when Ooto picks up an egg which asks her if she wants to change her future.<br />
<br />
The story really launches at this point, the audience is introduced to a dreamworld full of the regrets and the personification of inner problems that suicidal girls face, Ooto is given the task to save the girls who are in the eggs. She obtains eggs from a gacha machine and cracks them open, afterwards she needs to find a way to solve their regrets or help them overcome their inner problems. More is revealed about this later on, the plot twists involving the gacha eggs and the system are really well done and the messages the show deliver are executed in a completely satisfactory way. Every important scene is full of symbolism, this is definitely the type of show to watch with your full attention, it is also highly recommended that you pause and reflect between each episode. There are also a lot of heavier themes in place mixed with the lighthearted atmosphere, the themes are handled well and do not conflict with the more easy-going atmosphere outside of the dreamworld events. The director very effectively balanced the show so that it was never oppressively dark or painfully edgy but still carried the serious tone that should be expected given the themes and subject matter. Overall, the story is, until its ending, fairly well executed and one of the most original ones in recent anime, it tells a wonderfully crafted story of self redemption and overcoming inner turmoil, it gets a 7 out of 10 for its creativity and originality but it loses points for failed execution near the end.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
The artwork is movie quality, it does not feel like a TV anime at all, every single scene looks like something out of an anime movie. From the background art which looks lifelike at times due do some absolutely amazing tracing work, to the food which looks like it belongs in a Ghibli film with its detail and rich colors, everything in the show has a lot of love and care put into it to an extent that is shocking for a TV anime. Most of the transition scene backgrounds, such as Ooto walking in the rain or the flowers in the fields can very well work as wallpaper for a 4k computer background, it cannot be understated exactly how detailed all the art is for this series. The symbolism is reminiscent of Mawaru Penguindrum and Madoka, while the action is about as fluid as Mob Psycho despite the massively more detailed character design. With a combination of rather unique looking enemies, excellent fight Choreography and cuts during major attacks, Wonder Egg Priority might have some of the best action scenes among recent anime even though action is not even the main focus given the nature of the story.<br />
<br />
Character designs for all the girls were quite well done as well, the studio used a very saturated vivid color pallet for each character which can conflict with lighter backgrounds, however the characters actually contrasted in quite a beautiful way with the scenery present. The girls had unique traits such as a variety of skin tones, eyes colors, hair highlights and subtle differences in body type that set them apart from each other in a bold way, the studio did not use cheap tricks like recycling the character model with different hair colors or overdoing the body type differences between the girls to differentiate them. Every girl also has a unique outfit, texting style and accessories that convey their personality, an interesting weapon in the dream world which reflects their trauma, and they all have some of the most detailed reaction facial animations for when the girls are tense, excited, smug, frustrated, upset. Its worth adding that very few shortcuts were used like blank faces during distant convos, characters speaking without being seen, and there was next to no CGI at used at all for character movements despite the intense detail in their character design. Now the combat animation wasn’t perfect in that characters did have a lot of transition cuts during fights, however it was done in a tasteful way that actually added a lot of impact to the hard hits, blood splatter, knock back effects present. Wonder Egg Priority also managed to achieve something only a handful of anime have ever achieved, true horror during a fight scene, anime by design is pretty terrible at conveying a sense of horror due to how difficult it is to make a scene looks revolting, but that crocodile and butterfly scene really does it.<br />
<br />
Overall, the presentation of Wonder Egg Priority is spectacular, the show essentially has no notable flaws and exceeds expectations in every way, there is nothing present or lacking that lowers its score and due to this it receives a very rare perfect score for its art production values.<br />
<br />
The sound: 8<br />
<br />
Interesting OP, an ED that closed each episode perfectly, sometimes in a hilarious tonal shift, but I maintain that it was perfect, the show also highly effective sound effects for fights. The OP itself including both the sound and the visuals really fill the audience with a strong sense of familiarity, it genuinely feels like the richness of daily life and all those small moments we take for granted being highlighted in the form of a warm and slow song. The background music soundtrack by itself was not that impressive, unlike other shows this series is compared to, for example Madoka Magica. However, on its own, it still complements the show well enough, and its memorable, therefore an 8 feels like a fair appraisal of the music.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
<br />
The cast is all female, and they are all focused on saving someone they knew that committed suicide, this binds them together and gives them a common background. Outside of the common tie, these girls come from entirely different socio economic and familial backgrounds and they all have entirely different, but complementary personalities. Every girl is well fleshed out and this anime feels like an inverse Bechdel test in ways, there are next to no men present, if they are present, they are either a source of trouble or irrelevant to the cast. In short, the cast is very similar to most magical girl shows; however it goes a step above and beyond in both their characterization and their distinct designs, all of the girls have an important story to tell and they are all in this important journey together.<br />
<br />
As noted, before, men in the show are usually portrayed as bystanders or active antagonists, there is not much character development for them except one man who was very relevant for the protagonist. This is a notable weakness for the show, the antagonists are not really solidly fleshed out, the final antagonist was thrown in without any significant foreshadowing. It can be argued that the system itself and the girls inner problems can substitute as an antagonist, but its always nice to have a well characterized antagonist with their own motivations and goals that are clearly explained, while a true antagonist is sort of provided near the end of the series it felt a bit too rushed in to be counted. Despite missing a properly built up antagonist character, the main cast does grow together and complement each other well, they have their disagreements, conflicting opinions on whether or not they really have to undertake the egg gacha, and their moments of coming together after a major event. Overall, the main cast do feel like real characters with a lot of substance and depth, with multiple motivations for their actions and solid foundation behind the friendship they form with each other. The characters are a solid 8, it would have been better if there were solid antagonists and if the secondary cast such as family or the girls being saved had some more interesting moments, but the strength and development of the main cast was still quite well done.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
Between the exceptional visuals, the original plot, interesting cast, and initial great direction, Wonder Egg Priority was easily among the 3 best shows this season. This is despite the fact that some of the most well awaited and popular sequels came out in the same season. Every episode was a fun ride, and it was entertaining to come up with theories on where the show was going to go and ending up being right or wrong. It ranks very high on the enjoyment scale overall, definitely one of the most fun anime in recent history, probably the most fun original anime in years.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
The production values, direction, story, cast all being excellent lead to this show being given a 9 overall. This was one of the best recent anime that made, definitely one of the best original anime in years, it had an excellent approach a lot of hard issues without making the story edgy and outside of the last leg of the story it was executed with perfect direction. If you enjoy visually impressive abstract shows with a psychological thriller plot, Wonder Egg Priority is right for you.<br />

    Wonder Egg Priority is baby’s first anti-suicide propaganda. It’s just the next, trendiest puberty anime on the block, and the egg symbolizes bad writing. It’s a teen drama filled to the brim with metaphorical imagery and action which screams their exact meaning so loudly and with so little nuance, they’re nearly literal, and as a result of this, anyone with even the slightest modicum of emotional maturity or life experience will find themselves knowing everything this show is going to say as soon as its subject matter is made so clumsily clear. Minor spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
I once said about Nijigahara Holograph, a great thing about crushing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388187">
        your story under the weight of its own symbolism is that it becomes so interpretive, critics can’t even parse through enough to say it made no sense. However, unless you, the author, actually dare to explain yourself and your imagery, you yourself can’t say it did in fact make any sense either. This is why abstract art isn’t typically respected by critics, and that’s a problem for Wonder Egg Priority, because ultimately, it’s just an artsy student film. It’s abstract art which portrays teenagers fighting personifications of suicidal tendencies in an effort to overcome them in this weird egg limbo to empower the audience who presumably finds their problems relatable, but the degree to which the show actually grasps what it seeks to comment on wavers greatly throughout the show to the point it almost makes these very legitimate adolescent anxiety issues seem laughable as a consequence of how over-the-top the imagery is. Ugly little CG goblin bullies called “Seeno Evils,” other ugly CG abominations called “Haters,” a heterochromic main heroine named “Ohto Ai” who’s name is enunciated “Odd Eye.” I mean, come on people! Explaining this kind of shit to an eleven year old would be patronizing, yet when these kinds of symbols appear in the same show as a very realistic portrayal of someone cutting themselves and a very poignant analysis of why people generally do so, it really begs the question how serious the authors were about tackling either issue. One episode it’s dangerously suggesting all chūnibyōs are medically schizophrenic, another episode it’s outrageously claiming boys never commit suicide for emotional reasons, and another episode it places a transgender boy, a biological girl, in the egg limbo after having established no boys are allowed in the egg limbo…so I guess it’s based and redpilled? My point is it’s extremely hit or miss, but when a show is hit or miss while touching on delicate topics, especially a show like this which is always soapboxing and using its cast as a moral mouthpiece, it just comes across as ignorant and disingenuous.  <br />
<br />
For a show about dissecting people’s problems and helping them fight their mental hangups, the characters are, ironically, by far the weakest link. In the first episode, Ai completely rejects to the point of physically running away from the cordial and friendly advances of the most calm, collected, and kind girl on the planet, but then immediately afterwards in episode two, she’s suddenly trying her hardest to shamelessly insert herself into the life of the most stuck-up and thoroughly unapproachable character in the show, Neiru, as if we didn’t just watch an entire episode of her being portrayed as unmanageably shy. Momoe is a masculine looking girl who&#039;s self-conscious about her appearance and wants to look more feminine. Her problem is even though she&#039;s straight, she only attracts girls she has to constantly turn down who thinks she looks handsome and dashing. Men don&#039;t approach her because she looks too boyish, and she doesn&#039;t approach men because she lacks the self-esteem. One day, a man approaches her and asks her to go on a date, but when she shows up for the date, this time wearing a dress that accentuates her femininity, the man reveals he was gay and mistook her for a guy, and dumps her. The problem is this established Momoe—a character with short, straight hair who for some reason wears a collared shirt under a slim-fit sweater and khaki slacks—can, indeed, look like a girl if she puts even the slightest bit of effort into doing so, therefore invalidating her entire internal crisis. Ai’s school counselor who the show insistently implies is a creep who grooms his students, and who Ai saw after school being intimate with her friend who committed suicide soon thereafter, is suddenly turned into a contrived love interest/father figure when he hooks up with Ai&#039;s mom. Even character development that sticks the landing like that of Rika, the final of the four main characters, feels fruitless because it doesn’t change the group dynamic at all, and unfortunately, the plot turns out to be way more important than you thought, and the plot is nothing short of boring.<br />
<br />
The writers seem to be under this weird impression that by introducing supernatural elements into their story, you’re not allowed to criticize its internal consistency in any way. The whole egg limbo with all the crazy egg fights and bizarre monster designs never have any thematic weight, and despite the fact what little emotional weight is there usually misses the mark entirely, the big autistic shounen battle speeches they give usually leaves you feeling as if their emotions are all that really matters in this world and not to really mind the details of the allegory since it’s probably shallow anyway. However, given everything I discussed in the last paragraph, trying to dissect the characters typically falls apart, so all that’s eventually left to chew on is those visuals, which the show seems to want to sell you on without actually offering you any understanding of, kind of like how a magician will let you watch their trick a thousand times but never let you touch any of their mechanisms. Now, don’t get me wrong. I&#039;m all for interpretive media, but said media has to actually suggest interesting interpretations. The egg monster representing a rapist has a big dick nose on his face with an unruly mustache around its base, the egg monster representing a coach who body shames their students has giant rolls of fat and absurdly large and saggy tits...okay, cool, so is that it? The issues the show wants to portray are always deeper than the symbolism—let alone its thin characterization—gives them credit for, and when the plot finally rears its ugly head, it tries to lazily wrap everything up by explaining away all the supernatural nonsense with a ridiculous pseudo science fiction plot which takes the time to imply all women who take their own lives only do so impulsively, and if it wasn’t for that fleeting moment of weakness, our villain who we just introduced five seconds ago who can poison people’s minds never would’ve been able to lead them to suicide. Meanwhile, I still can’t decide which is more offensive. That shit, or the aforementioned suggestion that boys don’t kill themselves for emotional reasons.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the ideologues in charge of writing Wonder Egg Priority, their little snowflake here isn’t special, and the same rules of storytelling which apply to everything else also apply to it. The show always comes down to pacing, but since everything gets shoved towards the tail-end of the story, elements of the narrative which probably wouldn&#039;t have been as egregiously melodramatic with proper set-up end up piling up at the end and making the whole thing a total slog, because the empty-headed artsy student film it was at the beginning ultimately didn’t have any legs, and the misguided Flip Flappers/Magical Girl Madoka★Magica/last two episodes of Evangelion/Kara no Kyoukai: Fuukan Fukei rip-off it was at the end did little but make an internal mess of its already externally messy symbols and expose this show for exactly what it is: a largely incongruous anime inspired by those far more genuine and artful than itself. I have an inherent respect for a commentary on how modern Japanese society handles mental illness and suicide, but as entertainment, it’s mediocre far longer than it is interesting. One may argue the show concerned itself more with visualizing its themes than it actually did with being mysterious about what they were, but that would imply any of these images were deeply meaningful, and more to the point, part of a plot which explored them appropriately at all. I’m only now realizing I haven’t said a single positive thing about this show yet, so I guess, if only in keeping with how back-heavy the show itself is, I’ll flip the script and admit this isn’t actually a horribly bad show as much as it is a confused one. Despite a hellish production crunch which resulted in a recap episode and some inconsistent quality throughout the latter half of the show, Wonder Egg Priority is gorgeous, and this obvious passion behind the animation proves the show isn&#039;t as much of a grifter as I made it out to be. It’s just an amateur therapist who needs to work though their own problems before trying to help others overcome theirs.<br />

    Wonder Egg has come, and it&#039;s hit so many marks and boundaries, it&#039;s unreal. No matter where I go, no matter who I talk to when it comes to WE, it&#039;s always in a positive tone. Even I recommended it to a friend, and they enjoyed it too. That&#039;s the quality of Wonder Egg. Really top notch stuff, but let me explain why this is the case within this review.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
It&#039;s story mainly concerns our lead in Ooto Ai. Whom doesn&#039;t have the best life, from being awkward around others, shy, but always self conscious when it comes to her looks. As she&#039;s suddenly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377300">
        drawn into this really weird place through breaking a Wonder Egg after being told such, and being drawn to this world where they deal with someone&#039;s past trauma in order to escape it. Said past trauma, turns into quite a terrifying monster, each being different then the next one, which is very creative and the level of mystery, just adds so much interest. WE is also not afraid of diving into very deep and concerning topics too, and they handle them well.<br />
<br />
Ai isn&#039;t the only character we meet and get to know more of however. We get to meet her only friend, and best friend at the time, and the reason behind her wanting to partaking in these events in general, as we learn the tragic fate that befell her, and a more reason to why Ai is mainly home most of the time. As the series goes on, we&#039;re learning more on other WE users, in likes of Neiru who seems more of a calculated type with her own goals in mind, but has befriended Ai, as Ai seems like a positive influence she surely needs. Along with a girl/idol named Rika Kawai, whom just seems like a range of emotions, which her past shows why the way she is, and how it&#039;s effected her. She seems a bit of a arrogant bitch type, but there is more layers then what is shown, which is always good stuff, and good details. Along with many more characters that we&#039;ll meet over time.<br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
The art is where it goes into deep places. As backgrounds and characters look great, they always look create. But the creative ideals when it comes to the monsters is just very great indeed. They really go all out and leave nothing behind at all. They make it look great, but also make it seem terrifying and intense too. Also adds to that with the sound design, it&#039;s all good stuff and I can&#039;t complain there.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg is a highlight on a Tuesday for sure, it&#039;ll be one of the anime&#039;s of the season, maybe even the year at this rate. Watch it now honestly. Watch it now!

    This review might be what I understood and what I believe it would be or could be about this anime. Before anything I want to say that don&#039;t get scammed by just the slice of life tag... it more than that, I can assure.<br />
<br />
First I will say about the overall concept of WEP (Wonder Egg Priority). Its a show which deals with some of the not so normal circumstances that one might face when we are brought up. Some of us were blessed with good friends right from the start but some had some problems in making good friends or I should say some more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377333">
        into themselves and not participated in other activities (like sports, active in class and more open to others and young age like 10-18) . Just by this one can predict that the ones which are lonely are bullied, harassed or ignored at a very a early stage of their lives. (here in this case, school days)<br />
<br />
This anime goes into this aspect as the characters here faces those problem and because of this, some unfortunate events happens to their lives (like something happens to their loved ones or the ones who stayed with them in their bad times) . Its all about coping up with those feelings and living on.<br />
<br />
Coming to anime, its animation is very good . The setting at first looks very neat as some cute little girl going through her life. The CGI of somethings (supposed to be monsters) is quite disturbing as you would also feel once you see it yourself. But at the end you will understand as to why it had to be like that. xD<br />
<br />
<br />
PS- This is my first review :3 and this one is on the basis of watching just 4 episodes so at the end I might make changes in the score that I gave.<br />
Would appreciate if you would find my review helpful.<br />
<br />
Have a good day all of you! Cheers!!<br />

    Beautiful girls, colorful world, shocking theme and entangled with a few drops of melodrama, psychological sexual exploitation of minors and girls suffering all the time. I&#039;m not talking about Madoka Magica or Flip Flappers, but rather a well-known Wonder Egg Priority that started with the maximum expectations of the audience as the best anime of the year and ended up as an uncontrolled, messy and poorly written train.<br />
<br />
Every human being in his worst state has been in depression at some point in his life. Some have psychological scars, others try to get away with suicide, a very common theme in this community.<br />
<br />
The path chosen by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389959">
        the writers was to use a formula aimed at teenagers who are going through this so that they understand what they are going through. Simple, isn&#039;t it? but how to do it correctly when you are not aware that for every purpose there must be a cause? there&#039;s a lot of that error in the anime. An example is the starting point when our main character Ooto Ai, who was bullied for having heterochromia, meets a girl, Koito, who becomes her friend and seems to want to help her, but she is also bullied and to some extent commits suicide and there begins one of the mysteries of why she committed suicide and why all the other girls (only girls) commit suicide - which I will leave for later. The point at which any characteristic development is lost is afterwards, when she closes completely, stops going to school and enters the world of dreams, meets the first of the three girls, Neiru, Rika and Momoe and suddenly becomes another girl? before meeting her new friends, she changes her depressed and closed personality to cheerful and charismatic, without any development before (in another moment a girl asks if she was so happy before her friend&#039;s suicide and she confirms. the writers made the character to confirm a mistake made by them. MAGNIFICENT! &#039;&#039; APPLAUSE &#039;&#039; &quot;Laughter&quot;). This is not the only point of this same issue that I will highlight. All girls are poorly characterized. Throughout the anime, with each episode, they have a different personality and act in an inconvenient way for the previous and later. His mood swings are what irritates me the most. The only character in all of this is the ura-acca that he showed himself with convincing motivations and a good character.<br />
<br />
<br />
Points<br />
<br />
Dramatic melodrama is an intermediate point that makes a leap to characterize the characters at the time of intrigue, since it is not so bad, which guarantees a point.<br />
<br />
The animation is great and colorful, but the art style is common and the action scenes are well done, although they are few. Another point for the shounen of beautiful magical girls overcoming their pain.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is unbalanced and does not match the show in some parts, but some are relaxing.<br />
<br />
Driving is rubbish and a mess.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t care about the ones mentioned above.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this part I will leave behind the less important summary residues and embark on the most critical and absurd questions contained in this program.<br />
<br />
WEP tends to put girls at risk and make them suffer a lot for the pleasure of us men, a heavy psychology existing in the real world and little commented on, about how pornography has changed our minds returning to an even worse method not only instinctive (aggressive) but also imposing the woman as a sexual and unmerited object of pleasure in full favor of the man.<br />
<br />
Throughout the episodes we have several disconnections in the explanations that sometimes do not make sense, are very superficial or are thrown in your face and have no impact, they are simply simple, just like the symbolisms used, they are simple and superficial - inside the egg is the cocoon - depression - egg incubation - release - self-discovery and change (sudden change typical of Ai). The puppets that represent the bullies (rude, by the way, they have knives, but only one shot once and then no more, instead they run after almost every episode. And there is the &quot;slow motion&quot;, they run and run fast in movements normal and the puppets don&#039;t reach them, so when they cut to the top camera they&#039;re running fast like the characters. Incredible. It&#039;s not because they don&#039;t really reach them, but to occupy the screen time causing suspense while the characters talk nonsense. The goals that the heroines must fulfill are too simple.-. &quot;Wonder Egg Priority&quot; or better &quot;The mission of the wonderful girls that blossomed from an egg&quot; left the result of rika out, not that it made a difference after all.<br />
<br />
When the special comes out, it won&#039;t make a difference either.<br />
<br />
The loose ends are revealed when we reach the final stretch of the famous explanation. Acca and Ura-acca were and are two geniuses. Yes. how did they become geniuses? we don&#039;t know and we don&#039;t know how and where they learned to create AI, Frill, who did they raise as a daughter and what was the likelihood that the two alone would create something like this? Frill jealous of another woman who entered the family- Frill kills the woman- she leaves a daughter- Frill beaten and imprisoned by Acca - The grown daughter waits for Ura-acca&#039;s feelings - Murdered (I forgot the sounds of the mediocre kiss) - Yeah it was Frill who stayed in the basement with computers and wires “wow” - Ura-acca throws it in the fire and at the end - This is where our heroines&#039; story begins. And what do we get out of it? Female action? Desire for revenge? Possession? Love it? Sex? Women desiring men? Jealousy? None of this, but something similar to speculation in previous episodes about a definition similar to this; “Women commit suicide because they are fragile and sentimental, that is, women cry, suffer, have feelings and men do not. They have none of that. That was stated. AFFIRMED. Do they even deny suicide to men? Like this? Aren&#039;t men human? Are men instinctive like animals, are they more like them? In fact, yes, but that does not justify, we are all living beings. Pathetic. The writer denied this fact. Pathetic. I have two hypotheses about its character. Or he&#039;s a maniac who likes masochistic pedophilia or a lgbt Protestant femist who plays fanatic, but actually likes fat thighs getting thinner - I can&#039;t forget, and who even inserted a type of bipolar sexuality disorder together with its other themes of suicide, depression, bullying, family drama, parallel universe between dream and reality and sloppy science fiction embedded in a timeline certainly very well elaborated from an ORIGINAL 12-episode anime.<br />
<br />
The mind of the writer(s) is apparently also a mess, not knowing if they are supporters or opponents of both sexes, which makes a double error due to the lack of egalitarian thinking.<br />

Thank you for reading. To the next.

    Wonder Egg Priority is a pretentious mess that tries to sell itself as a deep and complicated story, but remains in the end another waifubait show. It brings to the table a lot of &quot;hot topics&quot; such as school bullying, teen suicide, sexism and sexual harassment, but never explores them in depth, it just throws more and more OMG SO DARK twists without any attempt to give them a meaningful context or resolution. <br />
<br />
Worse than that, this show tries to deal with heavy themes while pandering to horny male audiences. I just find it ridiculous when a series with such a massive focus on a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381293">
        sexual abuse and molestation simply oozes yuribait fuel. Sure, grouping of underage girls is horrible, but look at those two cute totally not lesbians touching each others feet or massaging thicc thighs, tee-hee ;)) Female characters is exactly what you can expect from any waifu show, they are cute, pushy, unnatutally sweet and empty headed. It is very hard to convince me that their feelings are real because their behavior doesn&#039;t resemble the behaviour of irl teenage girls, they all act and talk like popular moe tropes. It feels fake and uncanny.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say a lot of about the story because 6 episodes later there is barely any story. All you have is a monster of the week concept spiced up by DARK, FORBIDDEN, TWISTED THEMES and a mystery behind suicide of main character&#039;s friend that can be solved by a sleepy toddler. In one of the episodes characters quesntioned why there are no boys, and let me give you my answer: this show has girls only cast because no one would care about it otherwise. We have a countless amount of shows with male cast where boys are dealing with their inner struggles by punching creepy monsters or evil humans. I don&#039;t want to say that the same thing can&#039;t be done with girls; I have seen many people compare Wonder Egg Priority to Mahou Shoujo Madoka since the episode one which is a great disservice to the latter. Where Madoka uses cute girl suffering as a plot point, Wonder Egg Priority uses it as a selling point, an excuse to pretend that it&#039;s something more than it is.<br />

    *some spoilers ahead in a marked section; additionally, trigger warning for the topic of suicide and other sensitive themes being discussed in detail within this review as well as for viewers that watch episodes: 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12*<br />
<br />
	A quick thank you to Alfredo_Elric in helping write this review.<br />
<br />
When I first heard about Wonder Egg Priority, I heard about how beautiful it was at positive character portrayal and at confronting the serious issues of suicide and victim trauma. Little did I know that it would make me feel nauseated enough to hold a trash can near my face by the second to last episode.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388223">
        At this point, it was too late for me to stop watching. I needed to write down everything I felt and tell people about what Wonder Egg Priority is actually communicating to its viewers. In this review, I will interpret whether Wonder Egg’s themes are mere shock value and if this show portrays dark themes in a sensationalized way.<br />
	<br />
At first, Wonder Egg Priority appeared to subtly communicate the horrors of bullying and the tragedy of suicide. It appeared to tackle many sensitive themes in its first episodes, but for some reason, MyAnimeList removed Wonder Egg from the Slice of Life genre and placed the anime in the Fantasy genre. Why is that? Wonder Egg’s lack of depth is partially based on the fact that it does NOT function as a realistic show. You can immediately tell something will go wrong by the end of the episode with an immediate resolution if you see the characters smiling in the first minute of watching…The plot is predictable, yet nonsensical because most battles involve a child single-handedly fixing a victim’s problems in a single episode by defeating full-grown adult monsters in both the physical and metaphysical sense. A lot of the general situations can be interpreted as a form of abuse (i.e. child abuse, sexual exploitation, bullying). However, their dialogue does not explore the depth of the problem since once the monster is gone, the deeper issue never recurs again. The audience is not given more context other than how the victim experiences something traumatic. We do not learn what can be done to properly aid these individuals or what systemic changes are needed to stop further abuse from occurring. Instead, we are presented with a schoolgirl screaming, wielding a weapon, and slashing the monster from existence and a victim saying “Thank you” before disappearing. There is nothing wrong with supporting the idea of fighting to protect someone in real life, but Wonder Egg takes this belief too literally and nearly every episode delivers pretty-to-look-at action sequences to destroy another problem fiend. In other words, ‘real-life monster/problem of the week’. The reason why ‘disappearing’ is problematic is because the residue of trauma lingers within real victims. Wonder Egg writes away this important aspect by just erasing these victims’ existence. The main characters also lack any form of trauma from not just helping these victims, but their own experiences. It’s unfathomable to me as someone who has been haunted by a trauma for most of my life. The longevity of mental health issues is a real problem. Wonder Egg blatantly ignores this. <br />
<br />
Occasionally, it appears as if some of the characters are victim-blaming those who suffered and committed suicide. In the beginning, the main characters sometimes show hints of possible residue trauma, but only because of their friends who lost their lives. There are times when the main characters enter the dream world and confront the victims for taking their life. However, instead of calmly talking to them about their trauma, the main characters are too focused on the physical battle in front of them that they can appear to be unempathetic or hostile. The intention of the writers of Wonder Egg Priority is about the trauma of bystanders, but the focus is too heavy on the bystanders themselves without exploring the multiple factors leading up to the victim’s death. The issue is that the main characters also self-mourn rather than understanding what their late friend was going through. That implies that the director and writers wanted the audience to specifically pity the main characters and disregard the suicide victims who just disappeared. Japan, you still have over 1,400 suicides every year. Due to the pandemic in 2020, the number of suicides has risen to over 2,100 deaths, with an 83% increase in suicide amongst women. Rather than bring attention to the people who are bystanding, why don’t we bring attention to the people who have lost their lives and what can be done to help? The kind of show Wonder Egg Priority devolves into may actually harm more people than it helps, because of its almost complete disregard for those that have died. Since the focus is on bystanders, Wonder Egg only gives reasons without proper explanation for why the victims take their lives. This can lead to extremely dangerous messages to sensitive viewers.<br />
<br />
You might be asking: How are you supposed to write a story with sensitive themes then? In the 2nd season of 3-gatsu no Lion, one of the characters also deals with a continuous problem of bullying at their school that leads to the slow degradation of their mental health. Wonder Egg is very similar in this aspect. However, the main difference between 3-gatsu no Lion and Wonder Egg Priority is that 3-gatsu no Lion is realistic; this difference is extremely important, because 3-gatsu no Lion reveals the complexities of bullying and shows the audience the correct resolution. Wonder Egg emotionally manipulates the viewer with exposition dumps, graphically displays the problem, and solves bullying with a sword. In 3-gatsu, there are both supportive and less competent adults in the series with emphasis on the former; this matters, because it provides the audience with the notion that asking for help will always be a viable course of action. Wonder Egg only has suspicious and negligent adults which gives off the opposite message: I cannot trust adults. Wonder Egg falls into the same pitfall that a lot of other misled media have as well. Even now, the media will either glorify suicide or treat suicide as a statistic. This has led to the world accepting suicide just happens, just like what we see in Wonder Egg Priority. In other words, it is normalized by both everyday people and the Wonder Egg main characters. In fact, when the media content of suicide is done incorrectly, it can go as far as create a copycat effect amongst viewers, making Wonder Egg Priority a dangerous viewing experience. That is the fault of not just the writers, but countless shows, movies, and Internet culture that have incorrectly portrayed sensitive themes for years on end.<br />
<br />
I cannot say more without being specific about the characters, the story, and the themes. If you would like to avoid these spoilers, which explain in depth the significant problems with Wonder Egg Priority, please skip to the last 2 paragraphs.<br />
<br />
/*Spoiler Section*/<br />
<br />
	Arguably one of the worst six episodes are the ones involving child abuse. We are told by a young girl around the age of 14 that her father allowed his workplace boss to molest her multiple times. Additionally, we are told that her mother asks the girl to live with it. All the while, one of the MCs, Sawaki tries to comfort her. Later, when confronted by the girl’s inner demon indicating the man who sexually assaulted her, the girl ‘willingly’ concedes her body to protect the hurt Sawaki battling this demon until Sawaki slashes the pedophile dead and the girl is saved. Although there is some relief when the hellish monster is destroyed, the tell-not-show aspect very poorly depicts heavy themes as the audience is made to pity the victim without proper closure. Sadly, the audience is never given an indication for what that sword slash could possibly mean in real life as one cannot simply solve real-world problems with a blade. If that were the case, the messaging would have even more concerning implications. Assuming that is not the case, we are still left to wonder what this sword is meant to symbolize in real life as this object is utilized as a oversimplified solution to such a complex problem such as child abuse that requires significantly more tact to solve. If Wonder Egg had decided to provide some sort of metaphor for long-term therapy or treatment in addition to the aforementioned scene, this issue could have been resolved. Sadly, it did not.<br />
<br />
	13 Reasons Why, a problematic series that has been strongly criticized by The National Association of School Psychologists, is comparable to Wonder Egg Priority in two aspects. <br />
I will talk about each separately. <br />
<br />
The way that teachers/counselors and parents are negatively portrayed is problematic. The counselor in 13 Reasons Why came off as unapproachable and incompetent while the teacher in Wonder Egg Priority comes off as suspicious. Starting from the 1st episode, it is obvious that Ai does not trust him when he enters her house. I know this is a drama show so having a ‘villain’ might make the viewing experience more entertaining, but speaking realistically, the existence of this character may send a very negative message: don’t ask for help or trust adults, similar to the ‘unintentional’ messaging of 13 Reasons Why. The fact that Ai’s mother is also rather uninvolved and negligent of Ai is highlighted by the fact that she trusts the suspicious teacher that Ai seems to resent. This small detail indicates a lack of communication between Ai and her mother. If Ai’s mother knew how Ai was truly feeling, Ai’s mother would not seem as blissful as she is portrayed in her few scenes in Wonder Egg and possibly more attentive to Ai’s well being. This also means that Ai either did not feel comfortable approaching her mother or did not feel the need to talk to an adult about this serious issue. Ai’s choices and the adults’ actions send the message that ‘you and ONLY you can do anything.’<br />
<br />
In 13 Reasons Why, there is a scene that got deleted from Netflix because all psychiatrists, teachers, and parents strongly urged them to remove it; Wonder Egg has a very similar scene in which a girl lays dead in a bathtub with blood soaked in the water. The scene was presented as a suicide; it appeared as if her wrists were slit. Worse yet, another plot twist used to shock the viewer reveals this ‘suicide’ scene was murder. I almost threw up when I saw the dead body. It made me remember something I did not want to remember...I wish there was a trigger warning for episode 11 because of the content displayed.<br />
	<br />
	As I mentioned earlier, Ai’s character is developed from her experience as a bystander to someone who was bullied. Ai’s personality is rather simple, changing from someone self-conscious and alone to someone who is more upbeat and dedicated to saving others because of the suicide of her only friend. However, her development from then and now stagnates as nothing shakes her while she successfully destroys all monsters from then on, much like a Mary Sue. While her narrative is very optimistic, her lack of struggle considering her trauma can feel unnatural at times. She is initially presented as a sad individual and then becomes a rather artificial character the audience just follows for most of the series. Her personality can appear bipolar because of her battles and traumas, which also leads to inconsistency. Even considering all this, she is unfortunately the ‘best’ character in this series.<br />
<br />
	Neiru is an extremely unsettling character with messy development across the whole show. Neiru’s position in the story is awkward and her purpose eventually devolves into a gateway for poorly handled sensitive themes. We don’t know anything about her except that she runs a company and can do gymnastics. The recap episode also called her a ‘tsundere’ but she seems like someone who appears emotionless the entire time. Her character starts out very melancholic before doing nothing for half the series, and then she becomes a contrived mess of emotions. She appears to become more ‘open-minded’ and even introduces the other characters to her house...to meet her comatose friend. Suddenly, we get thrust into Neiru’s fantasy world that escalates into Neiru victim-blaming her suicidal friend. Neiru’s character development after reuniting is whether or not to pull the life support of her friend who is still in a comatose state. This decision happens without this friend’s consent in a disturbingly sugar-coated way. I apologize for breaking the standard of political correctness, but I was infuriated when Neiru made the decision with Ai while they both smiled. If someone tries to say that ‘there was consent’, allow me to ask: “Is it really legal to pull the plug if someone ‘consents’ in a dream state? Or is it murder?” I strongly believe Neiru and Ai are murderers. I literally seethe with rage as I think of this scene. This alone is one of the worst moments I’ve seen in all of anime. The positive portrayal of such a scene is painstakingly infuriating.<br />
<br />
	Kawai, is a former idol with an upbeat personality and tends to tease others in order to create a sense of light-heartedness, something that is normally well-appreciated in a depressing show that explores darker themes. What makes her interesting, initially, is her past of self-harm indicated by the scars on her arm and the guilt towards the suicide of one of her fans even though she believed there was nothing she could have done. This makes Kawai, a seemingly flat character, actually have undergone character development off-screen. The most consistent character but also arguably one of the worst characters, in which her personality developed into the rather poor and cliche message, ‘fuck adults’ while also exhibiting her desire to self-harm, another similarity to 13 Reasons Why. Moreover, Kawai is the only character with the allusion of giving up on life during a battle with a monster, but because she has a turtle, rather than actual human friends, she’s ‘okay’. This particular episode is another contender for ‘worst episode’ because Wonder Egg’s use of over-subtlety does not mesh well with the sensitive theme of suicide. Her growth from that episode is implied by the quote, “Even if it means hurting myself, I’m going to live!” This kind of belief is atrocious for a character who has a past of self-harm. Rika is not a reckless character like shounen MCs, Deku, Monkey D. Luffy, Ichigo Kurosaki, Natsu Dragneel, and anyone else you can name. She’s mentally unstable yet all that gets brushed off because a deus ex machina saved her? That’s just not acceptable. Why didn’t they use this as an opportunity to show her friends are there to support her? <br />
<br />
	Sawaki lacks proper development since her only notable trait is her boyish look, and her two traumatic experiences. One experience is with a girl who was sexually abused and the other is with a girl who committed suicide aftering failing to seduce Sawaki. There is not much more to say about a character who serves as a 2nd gateway for more horrendously executed themes. Sawaki is like a slightly less awful, sad Neiru. In Sawaki’s ‘episode’, we get a 24-minute story centered around her gender identity crisis, but nothing is actually revealed about her development. Rather, the audience learns more about the people around her. A truck pile of themes including child pregancy, rape, transgenderism, and a multiude of other real-life problems are crammed in, similar to every other episode, but all of it is addressed with the sword once again. We learn nothing. Not about the victim’s condition, not about the trauma, not about how the victim or how Sawaki copes metaphorically. Nothing.<br />

After analyzing all of these details and putting them in a review, my mental health has taken a toll. Like myself, I know people in real life who’ve experienced at least one of these implied traumatizing experiences I mentioned above, and remembering my experiences with these people is painful. It really hurts. It’s a reminder of all the suffering they went through and how I couldn’t always figure out how to help them. Similar to 13 Reasons Why, Wonder Egg Priority is not good for people like me. It’s not that I’m overly sensitive to dark themes or anything like that. I found the presentation of the themes problematic because Wonder Egg Priority harmfully sensationalizes real life problems. It twists reality into something that is appallingly insensitive and offensive to watch. I’m probably going to take a break from this kind of show for a while, because it makes my heart ache in the worst way possible. <br />
<br />
One last thing before I end this review. Please, I ask from the bottom of my heart, do not watch Wonder Egg Priority if you have mental health problems. Avoid it like the plague. If you still want to watch, please watch with a friend or family member. I honestly regret watching. If I didn’t watch with one of my best friends, Alfredo_Elric, my experience with Wonder Egg Priority would have been even worse. If you are someone who needs to talk about what you are dealing with, please call a hotline, 800-273-8255, or talk to your friends and family. I can’t stop everyone from watching, but I beg of anyone reading this to not watch Wonder Egg Priority unless you know of its problematic nature.

    When I first heard about this original anime of the season. I decide to watch it and discover the wonders of the anime. And I really love how gorgeous the visualisation in the anime. But expect some things you&#039;ll see behind this awesome animation.<br />
<br />
The story starts with Ai Ohto carrying a mysterious egg. And then, this is where the supernatural begins. She now found herself in a very eerie school and was convinced to break the egg by a mysterious person. The egg hatches and a person appears from the egg. Now this is where the thrill begins. <br />
<br />
Yes! A group of small minions with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388322">
        knifes known as &quot;Seeno Evils&quot; emerge and chase down to kill any person that comes out from this egg. And not just that, there&#039;s also a huge creepy looking monster known as &quot;Wonder Killer&quot;. So yeah, expect some more scary looking monsters that will cringe you out in many episodes. But that&#039;s what makes this anime fun to watch. <br />
<br />
The anime also has great things like the past of the main characters and many mysterious things happening around our main characters such as the suicide death of Koito Nagase. The anime actually holds 11 episodes instead due to episode 8 being a recap episode. And more things that ruins my enjoyment of the anime such as that weird pedophilia one I saw in one episode. But still, it is good enough for me. If this is the type of thrilling anime you want to see, then this anime will be good for you.

    *TRIGGER WARNING* (very slight spoilers too)<br />
<br />
Started watching this show blind and WOW. Was hooked since episode 1. Not sure as to why exactly but it&#039;s just my gut telling me that &quot;this shit&#039;s gonna be good.&quot; Writing this review 4 eps in and so far nothing&#039;s changed on how I feel about this show. <br />
<br />
Story and Characters:<br />
Really unique and very intriguing. The main theme tackled is suicide, a very difficult and serious topic, yet the show doesn&#039;t make it extremely hard nor heavy to watch. The characters&#039; emotions are conveyed really well. The development of the central character is also satisfying to see. Her personality

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377400">
        and attitude towards others slowly change as the weight of the burdens she carries are no longer hers alone. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound:<br />
Absolutely wonderful. The animation is just simply amazing. The colors and creativity make it lighter to watch but not to the point where it takes away the seriousness of the show. The different BGM just fits perfectly and boosts the general enjoyment of watching the show. The voice acting is spot-on and that&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Must watch this season! Just 4 eps in so far and I am cheering on for this show to win the anime of the season. Depending on how the rest of the episodes go, I dare say that this could be a contender for anime of the year. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
RIP THIS REVIEW AGED WELL

    So, Wonder Egg Priority. <br />
Interesting show to say the least, it&#039;s up to interpretation either this show is good or a complete garbage.<br />
Well I will explain to you why this is an outstanding show, the best of winter season 2021. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Story is pretty simple and you could get it from the premise, but basically it&#039;s a bunch of teens fighting against depression and suicidal thoughts in human form.<br />
Every episode is a one week adventures, roughly connected with one another. An evil force is mostly metaphorical, rather than being a real thing, but as show goes on we uncover some stuff in reality also.<br />
As a standalone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388234">
        episodes are really good with giving you an important message.<br />
<br />
Art is movielike, fight scenes in this show are the best, very colourful and well drawn.<br />
Each character has unique design which in a way represents their personalities. Everything is fluid, backgrounds are well drawn.<br />
Not much to say about it, other than that being an excellent piece of work from the artists.<br />
<br />
Sound design are very good, some scenes are silent than it is necessary, OST as a whole is alright. Opening is unique, cause of how quite it is, that actually works perfectly with the saddest episodes, ending is sung by main cast voice actors, song is upbeat and catchy, idk if it fits, but I was ok with it.<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
Well, characters is something why I enjoy this type of shows, and this one doesn&#039;t let me down. Each character has a distinct personality and goal, all of the have their own stuff to deal with.<br />
Trauma is real in this show and it making me feel what the characters feel at the moment of time.<br />
Characters progress, and have more development as the show goes on. Slice of life moments are so good, and these heartwarming moments just making me feel even more sad than something traumatic happens to them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
You definitely will enjoy this anime if you enjoying weird psychological dramas like Eva, or Madoka Magica. If you are not fan of these shows than you might enjoy it, idk, but I liked that either way.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
So that just ended on an... ... interesting point, there has to be another season overwise idk what to make of this. I will give it a ten for now and wait for the some announcement from the studio if there is gonna be an additional episodes or not.<br />
*Update so additional special, was comedically bad, but I won&#039;t change this review, cause some people seem to like it.<br />
Thanks for reading my first review!<br />
Enjoy the show.<br />

    Beautifully animated, a profound story and bubbling friendship. Wonder Egg Priority is one of the bangers of the winter season 2021 and one of my favorites. It’s a story about losing something close, fragile and extremely precious. Its about gaining something precious. It tells a tale while beautifully expressing itself visually and with figurative speech.<br />
<br />
--- Minor spoilers ---<br />
<br />
WEP is one of the anime which keeps me thinking about it after I’ve watched an episode. Form the get go it struck me that there was a lot of underlying messages and symbolism weaved through the beautiful animation. It’s main theme which is about suicide is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388229">
        driving motive behind this trippy tale. Especially about suicide from young girls. It is a not so happy topic brought forth as something to discover a reason behind it. Was it due to depression, pestering, disease, or simply because death looks better than life (for a moment)?<br />
<br />
You follow the main protagonist Ooto Ai on her endeavors to bring back her friend from the dead. With the help of so called “Eggs”. Crack an egg and save a girl who also committed suicide. With the power of some plot armor and a lot of determination Ohto Ai battles the insecurities or temptations which let to ones early death. And something in it looked beautiful to me. Literally fighting of your inner demons, getting a second change at redemption or peace. The funny thing is that the battle is a two stage set-up. Fight of the standard mobs (representing the many doubts/harmful thoughts) and fighting of the final boss (the trauma which caused it). Some of the battles scenes looked really crisp and satisfying.<br />
<br />
Next to being the hero of the day (night), Ooto gains new friends. It feels soothing to see her open up like a flower. The darker side of her story where she’s a shut-in is actually muffled away by the sheer cuteness and liveliness of Ooto. And between the meet-ups and giggles different sides of her friends are exposed. Something to think about and touch you as a viewer. Even when on the surface everything looks like its going so well, everyone had or is still fighting very hard to keep their heads above the water. I like it that the friends are there for each other, backing each other up. As they slowly grow closer to each other they become a group which shares their pain and happiness. I love the way how they do things that would seem like they only do to trusted people, to show of close and fond they’ve grown to each other.<br />
<br />
Each character feels like a typical character yet at the same time they boast some sort of originality. The best part is that their design looks absolutely adorable. Each of them have their distinct color palette which reminds me of the Konosuba cast<br />
We got the serious and levelheaded figure Neiru. She acts calm and calculated, heck even her weapon is a compass. Being the most intelligent character we see her struggle and clash with the pathos. The emotional side of things. She has a harder time to loosen up or to sympathize with others. Or is this a façade? Set up to hide her true feelings. We only know that she’s as tough as a diamond and she shines the brightest with her friends around her.<br />
There is queen charming. Yes, queen. This beautiful girl is almost as handsome as a knight on his white steed. Momoe is calm but also girly. She shy’s away from typical girls fashion but struggles to be seen as a girl. She’s mostly self-conflicted about her appearance. Her battle is laid out as acceptance. Can she accept who she is? Or does she need people to accept her. I think she would be an ideal tomboy figure.<br />
Rika Kawai, an outgoing girl with a sparkly personality. Being an idol is though, and dealing with fans even more. Are you responsible for them because they follow you? What do you do when guilt trips you over. A princes from the outside and a wreck on the inside. She’s one of those happy get-go characters who are wearing “masks” to hide their pain. They can’t be true to themselves, so they cant be truthful to others. It’s almost scary how she mirrors depressed people.<br />
And lastly we got our sun shine Oota Ai with an odd eye. A rather normal girl, I think. There is not something I can pinpoint on her except that she’s the mc. She’s the most compassionate of the four and she is also very cute. Her hoodie is simply to adorable. What surprised me was that Ooto had more than just one simple side to her. She can be shy, she can be daring, she can be girly, she can make funny faces. But best of all, she can smile so bright. Her battle and struggle with going to school is done very smoothly so that the topic of going to school didn’t stood out as a sore thumb as seen from a story perspective. Its only a shame we need a second season to see this happen. Then again I really want that second season with Ooto and her flashy battle moves. Don’t anger her!<br />
<br />
The music and sound effects overall are very good. Its feels natural and fitting of each scene. Music that is either completely blended in the world or really pops out is good. The intro song is also so soothing and does NOT DO justice to the insane cruelty in wonder egg priority. The song is so calming and pleasant it almost makes me forget every week that I watch an anime about battling insecurities and pain. WEP choose blend their music and sound effects in the world. From the crisp sound of transforming weapons to smacking trauma’s to oblivion, it all sounds great. On top of that the voice acting was superb. Every character had their distinct role and effortlessly conveyed emotion. <br />
<br />
While WEP has many good points, there were some things I liked a little less. The lack of explanation and the typical “MC saves the day” mechanic. It can make anime boring and not rewarding to watch. The typical “MC gets power up whenever it goes wrong” and some elements which are randomly added at some point were either confusing or unexplained. Until the final episodes hit. Where the story suddenly takes a deep dive into the driving power of WEP and the binding red thread of the story. Why the eggs are there in the first place and what the set up was for saving your friend. But most of all, not the temptation of dying, but the brutality behind it. It set itself up very strongly for a second season but only if it can get rid of plot armor.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg Priority rewards people with patience as the story slowly grows and evolves and let it explain itself. There are some elements to figure out yourself but overall it’s a very satisfying anime to watch. In a way Wonder Egg Priority strives to be artistic and with this, it is not an anime which everyone will like. You may dislike explained symbolism or the theme about suicide and self-harm but all in all, it’s just preference. If you like CGDCT then it’s your call.

    &quot;Accept your mistakes, overcome the past and live the present&quot;<br />

Wonder Egg Priority is about a girl with heterochromia named Ai Ooto who buys an egg to be cracked in the dream world. When the egg (or &quot;Wonder Egg&quot;) breaks, a girl appears whom she must protect from creatures called &quot;Seeno Evils&quot; and from a monster called &quot;Wonder Killer&quot; that represents the trauma of the wonder egg character.<br />
<br />
However, Ai will not be the only girl with this task. She will also accompany other girls throughout the world of dreams. Among them is Neiru Aonuma, a taciturn girl; Rika Kawaii, a somewhat bully girl and quite sincere

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388191">
        with what she thinks; and Momoe Sawaki, a girl with the appearance of a boy very popular among the girls of the school.<br />
<br />
Now, let me extend my review to understand the concept of Wonder Egg Priority a bit:<br />
<br />
As I said above, the girls buy a wonder egg (hence the name of the anime) and it breaks into the dream world. Upon hatching, a girl appears who must be protected from the Seeno Evils and the trauma depicted in the Wonder Killer. Apparently every girl on the Wonder Egg is a real person who passed away in real life.<br />
<br />
To all this I add that there are also some statues, which appear in each girl&#039;s dream, which represent a loved one or friend who once passed away. For these two reasons, Ai, the main protagonist, decides to try harder in this task because she believes that by this means she can bring back to life her only friend, who committed suicide long before the beginning of the anime.<br />
<br />
But the premise does not end here.<br />
<br />
Although the girl with the wonder egg (that is, the person who hatches the Wonder Egg) seems to be far from the problems of the protagonists, in reality this is related to some hidden characteristic in the personality and past of the protagonist. This can be understood when our characters (Ai, Neiru, Rika or Momoe) strike up a conversation with the wonder egg girl or face the Wonder Killer. Which means that what our protagonists face is their past (Family Relations, Friendships, Harassment, Violence, Sexuality, etc.)<br />
<br />
This also makes sense when we note that the statues - that is, the deceased loved ones of the protagonists - have a point in common with the girls from the Wonder Egg: Suicide…<br />
<br />
We see throughout the series that the plot alternates between the world of dreams and real life. Within the world of dreams, each girl&#039;s dream is different from the other in terms of two things: Stage and the Wonder Egg. The scene is related to the death of the girl&#039;s acquaintance (For example, Ai&#039;s is in a high school) so the statue is also positioned somewhere. Although it is called a statue for some reason, it has human characteristics such as why the protagonists manage to feel their temperature, for example. The Wonder Eggs meanwhile have already been explained in the previous paragraphs.<br />
<br />
Additionally there is a garden that is the center where the protagonists meet and buy the Wonder Eggs. There will be two living mannequins called Acca - who looks like an office worker - and Ura-Acca - who looks like a young university adult - who advise and guide the girls throughout the journey in the world of dreams.<br />
The real world, on the other hand, is practically as we know it. Although we do not see it as often as the world of dreams, we can highlight Ai&#039;s house, where current events around the protagonist are constantly shown. Obviously it also works to showcase events from the girls&#039; past.<br />
<br />
The first part of the anime has an easy-to-understand running script, all of this handled excellently. I can assure you that although you may predict some elements behind the anime, there will be things that will leave you with more questions and wanting to know more about Wonder Egg.<br />
<br />
However, the second part of the anime becomes a bit confusing when adding several elements in one fell swoop and the simplicity that was characteristic at first began to be forgotten in this second part trying to place more concepts without satisfying the viewer preferring to explain everything to the final which is not very pleasant to say.<br />
<br />
Production problems also had an influence, such as the sacrifice of one of the episodes to become a recap, which probably caused more pressure on the script. However, this does not make the anime necessarily bad and with many things from the plot to be considered. In fact there are things about this anime that deserve merit:<br />
<br />
We have a very dynamic cast, with characters that have different backgrounds from each other. Each one has a story and personality that manages to attract the viewer and feel an interest in why they decided to be part of the Wonder Egg. The friendship they form throughout the anime is a crucial point in Wonder Egg; The four girls spend a moment in real life meeting, talking and having fun times. For a psychological series, the relationship between our girls does not hinder the main focus of the plot. But this friendship is also conditioned because the girls help each other to overcome their problems and traumas, something that we will see when they speak or when they face the creatures within the world of dreams.<br />
<br />
Summarizing the previous paragraphs, Wonder Egg seeks to explore other deeper issues within each protagonist, we can see this with some episodes dedicated exclusively to the biography of each one of them. Let&#039;s take for example a person like Rika who has a totally different story and personality than what is presented at the beginning. This is good because we better understand the characters and the reasons behind why they decided to do the job within the dream world. The bad thing is that the worldbuilding is so slow that understanding the system and rules that make the whole Wonder Egg theme work generates some confusion for the conventional viewer who usually would not need to think much to understand it.<br />
<br />
Finishing my review of the story and characters, let&#039;s move on to the technical section:<br />
<br />
The first thing that we must highlight obviously is its high quality of animation and soundtrack. There is a very vivid color palette in each fragment of the anime. CloverWorks did an excellent job, perhaps one of the best I&#039;ve ever done, in animation and design. The characters are aesthetically pleasing and the background environment is, let&#039;s say, much more &quot;happy and colorful&quot; if we compare other similar works such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica. It is true that said anime made by Shaft has a much cuter design than CloverWorks, but Wonder Egg Priority mostly maintains the same aesthetic and does not progressively become something darker as Madoka Magica was.<br />
<br />
Perhaps many hope that this anime is much darker like Serial Experiments Lain, Neon Geneis Evangelion or Puella Magi Madoka Magica herself, especially since Wonder Egg Priority takes suicide as its main focus, a consequence of different social problems that the series shows. However, the colorful design stands in stark contrast to the subject matter in depth, giving the viewer a lively and eye-catching look with a deep and complex plot.<br />
<br />
However, the animation is not limited to presenting us with a pleasant and fresh atmosphere throughout the anime, we can also see an alternation with a more explosive style when the girls fight with the traumas. The fight scenes and the weapons used by the girls are a striking thing in those scenes. The viewer is going to be impressed even with the design of the traumas - The representations of the girls from the Wonder Egg - which get a spooky, but at the same time childish appearance. Even when animation falls into its worst production problems, such a problem does not necessarily spoil the enjoyment of each episode.<br />
<br />
We have an Opening that perhaps fits like the ring to the finger to the anime and, perhaps, one of the best events so far this decade: A very relaxing ballad with the group Anemoneria - a group formed by the four main seiyuu for this anime - singing in unison, while our protagonist Ai Ohto walks around the city, fusing animation with some real images. At some point in the video, Neiru, Rika and Momoe appear respectively, although they have a more secondary role. The important aspect here is the emotional part of the song alluding to a farewell to something or someone from the past and opening up to tomorrow. The sentiment in this song is so strong that many could surely cry even though Wonder Egg Priority is not explicitly a melodrama.<br />
<br />
On the other hand we have a more conventional ending and with a danceable pop style interpreted by Anemoneria herself while showing some images in photo album format the funny moments that the main protagonists spend giving a happier and more fun aesthetic, compared to the appearance calm and emotional of the Opening.<br />
<br />
With all the technical stuff that was generally excellent, Wonder Egg Priority should be one of the best-crafted animes, and perhaps the best work CloverWorks has yet. Unfortunately, the production problems, a product of having made 3 anime in the same season and, probably, due to the pandemic, led the plot to begin to loosen and age not in a good way, placing the last episodes with a series of holes of plot and unanswered questions.<br />
<br />
As a fan of an anime like Serial Experiments Lain I can say that the latest episodes were what I least expected from an anime like Wonder Egg Priority and unfortunately it also left me with questions.<br />
<br />
But despite everything, I like this anime and it is not precisely because of its animation quality. I liked various things about the anime in general, like the first part of the anime which for me was handled quite well and a nice cast. No matter what type of viewer you are, you are likely to identify with one of the girls, especially since their personality and history are independent. I would go back to see the anime without problems to relive the good and bad moments that our protagonists lived. But I&#039;d like Wonder Egg Priority to add a little more explanation to the plot, be it with more episodes, OVAS, or movies.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg Priority has a lot of potential and could easily be one of the best anime of this decade. Unfortunately 12 episodes were not enough to explain a world much bigger than previously thought.<br />

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
The supposed hidden gem of 2021 turned out to be a total garbage<br />
<br />
It&#039;s embarrassingly bad, i&#039;ve got drawn into this anime after i watched a GIF, it was that GIF where the red hair girl is reaching her hands towards the audience and her hand is bloody and she is smiling<br />
when i saw that GIF i though maybe this is a deep anime, i mean it has 8.33 score, it should be good right?<br />
<br />
one of the major theme of this anime is bullying, and we know this because of a background sound that literally says:&quot;if you see bullying pretend to not see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385062">
        it&quot;, there are so many issues with just this sentence,<br />
if you are smart you would immediately know this anime is nothing but pseudo-intellectual trash.<br />
here are the reasons: <br />
1) there are no schools in developed countries that say this, if you report bullying there are always consequences for the bully. (it&#039;s not relatable, it&#039;s like saying if you see rape pretend nothing happened!), there isn&#039;t a single explanation why they say :&quot;Pretend you don&#039;t see it&quot;, there is no benefit in pretending that we know of<br />
2) a good anime NEVER gives the message of it&#039;s story by saying it to us directly, that destroys any symbolism the anime is trying to give<br />
<br />
the bullies are displayed in the form of cringy and creepy dolls who are jumping slowly towards the protagonists with an axe (don&#039;t misunderstand it, it&#039;s not exciting, noting scary happens, heroes always get to run away) and the dolls never use their axe but only once and that&#039;s in the first episode<br />
<br />
<br />
and as for the characters we have it all!<br />
we have that super silent and lonely character who speaks only one word in response to MC because she doesn&#039;t want her friendship at first<br />
<br />
we have the Tomboy who maybe gay and the anime gets super preachy about why gender is a hoax or it doesn&#039;t exist or it&#039;s irrelevant... TLDW i don&#039;t care!<br />
<br />
didn&#039;t like the opening song as well, soundtracks were good though<br />
<br />
so yeah fuck this garbage, don&#039;t watch it

    TL;DR<br />
Wonder egg priority is basically a coming-of-age story about a gamer chick by the name of Ai Ooto- wordplay for heterochromia meaning odd eye in hirigana who finds a random egg in a random arcade she visits that tells her to break it. This egg is essentially Pandora&#039;s box. The entire anime from what I’ve seen is basically an allegorical story about mental health when it comes to being a misunderstood teen- from depression to anxiety. The art is brilliant, the soundscape is entrancing and the wacky cgi genocide is great when you consider that most of this may actually be in her head. For

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377337">
        a character driven plot, this tickled my brain in ways I could not even imagine.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
<br />
Be warned, this anime does cover very serious dark topics with a lighthearted undertone but has a lot of disturbing scenes depending on your interpretation. All the main characters are linked as they have had someone close to them commit suicide for various reason and each main character is undergoing some sort of psychological illness because of their regrets. They essentially play a game where if they are asleep and have crack a special egg that they have bought from a mysterious man, they have the opportunity to &#039;save&#039; their dead acquaintance. The egg also contains someone who has committed suicide and its the main casts responsibility to protect these girls from their demise from some weird cgi murderers. Each of these egg girls is an allegory as the main cast use saving them to essentially save themselves. Each episode so far has ridiculous weight behind it as they attempt to save the person they knew, not knowing how this game works. The world is not explained well enough but that&#039;s a selling point since we see it develop alongside Ai.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
<br />
One of the most visually pleasing anime of the winter 2021 season, this anime is really striking. Bold colours are used for the pretend world which contrasts with the dull monotony of the real world, in a world without that certain someone. The character designs are gorgeous and the animation feels smooth from the way they talk to the way that they walk. The CGI is probably the most tasteful use of it I&#039;ve seen which a certain anime could take hints from.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
<br />
Op is a short affair that perfectly sets the theme of reminiscing on painful memories. The animation of the op combines real world images with animated movements which is a pleasure to see. The soundscape is incredibly well developed and is pleasing to the ears and all around I love it. The op is sombre and regretful mirroring the overall message of the anime so far,<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10<br />
<br />
So far the characters are probably the most developed and this fleshed out I&#039;ve seen for any anime 4 episodes in, with their intentions obvious yet hazy, their mannerisms consistent and the emotions they feel are conveyed to us and we feel those with them. I can&#039;t really say much since its that perfect. It reminds me of Okabe near the middle of steins;gate.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you don&#039;t mind dark and depressing topics and want to learn something from an anime, this shouldn&#039;t be slept on. This anime is a perfect allegory of our lives and the strife we may encounter with a lot of psychedelic elements added that are pleasing to the eye. I need to see the rest of the anime for a full on review but so far I am enjoying myself and watching myself grow with the main cast.

    A teenage girl is burdened with responsibility and a rekindled guilt the moment she encounters an otherworldly being that grants her the power, the power to change something, the power to be something, and the power to do something. The girl is not alone in her path and it is not only her story that&#039;s being told, as other girls her age also walk the same road due to regret, guilt and desires of their own. <br />
<br />
From then on, a series of dark and gruesome events occur, those that have intricate philosophical concepts and ideas imbued in them, those that flow well as a narrative,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388420">
        those that introduce intriguing themes and moral dilemmas, those that are laced with revelations and twists that build up everything that will happen and contextualise everything that came prior, and those that characterise our main cast in a skillful yet subtle way. Art that is the culmination of it&#039;s genre that manages to comment on it and it&#039;s misdoings- while still embracing it, what it has built up and what it thrives in. Flavourfully subversive, a master at deconstruction and reconstruction, plenty knowledgeable of it&#039;s genre, and knowing fully well of what it wants to achieve, a show that one could very well sing no less praises for.<br />
<br />
But enough about Madoka Magica.<br />
<br />
You might have seen the comparisons between Madoka and Wonder Egg floating around, and it&#039;s honestly, embarrassing that some people hyped this up as &quot;The next Madoka Magica.&quot; Just because they shared a few surface level similarities.<br />
<br />
This Wonder Egg Priority review will be split into two parts, one where I will be analysing and dissecting the show, and what it has to offer, and the other, small segment, which concludes my thoughts on it.<br />
<br />
Due to the nature of the show, there will be spoilers, minor and heavy, that follow;<br />
<br />
<br />
The Wonders Of The Egg // The Crack In The Egg.<br />
<br />
<br />
This should come as a surprise to none, but Wonder Egg is one of the most visually enthralling shows in the last few years, even with the production issues that prevail. From camera angles and directing choices that are unique enough to be memorable yet subtle enough to not come off as jarring to the viewer&#039;s, to the characters- bubbling with expression and life- breathed into them by each and every stroke of the pen, to the beautifully animated and directed sequences riddled rich imagery, taking full advantage of what anime can achieve as a visual medium, Wonder Egg is definitely, if not anything else, a feast for your eyes. <br />
<br />
Not just the visuals, but the sound production also helps in immersing the viewer into the world. The almost juvenile rhythm of the piano gives heart to the light-hearted scenes and banter between the characters, the upbeat- almost dubstep sounding tracks contrast well with the given situation at hand, making it memorable, and the slow, melodic, tune that plays occasionally assists the viewer in finding emotional investment and attachment in the scenes presented. The distorted voices, echoing sounds, panning of the sound effects and voice overs correlating to the visuals at hand, and many more- seemingly small components of sound production, each executed well, add up, and deliver a final product that is pleasing to your ears. <br />
<br />
Sure, the production is great, but it is not what makes Wonder Egg Priority what it is. Now, let&#039;s get into the meat of Wonder Egg Priority, and what it provides as a story.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg is a mixed bag for many, but for me, I&#039;d say the flaws overweigh the merits.<br />
<br />
Following a unique enough premise with an abstract, obscure and deliberately confusing storytelling method that can be noticed just from the first episode, Wonder Egg launches itself at you, taking you straight into this world, the characters and doesn&#039;t give you a moment to spare. While some might see it as a great thing, as it seemingly doesn&#039;t waste time on mundane introductions or slow build up, it falls flat for me. The narrative of Wonder Egg is structured akin to a trap. Over the course of the series, Wonder Egg demands a lot of investment and attachment, whether it be in the characters or the on-going events. Seeing from the reception it has gotten, most people do manage to get invested- not because of the story doing a great job at building up it&#039;s characters and giving the viewers a reason we should care for them and their story that&#039;s being told mind you- but for the mere fact that the characters presented in the show are cute girls. It&#039;s a trap- but it&#039;s a trap that knows what kind of audience it&#039;s pandering to, because once someone does fall in that trap, they don&#039;t consider the shortcomings and flaws the show has, because they&#039;re overwhelmed by the amount of emotional moments they have to fawn over that more often than not, have little to no weight behind them. Everytime a new characters popped out of the egg, it felt as if someone was shouting &quot;Hey, look at this cute girl, they commited suicide, you should care about them!&quot; <br />
<br />
The domain of children has a final boss called a &quot;Wonder Killer&quot; representing the person who is the cause of the trauma of the respective girl in the real world and they are a bunch of one-note villains consisting of people like pedophiles, rapists, stalkers and other criminals. There&#039;s no depth or complexity to them.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg wants to feel the northern breeze on its skin whilst having the southern sun hung overhead. It&#039;s ambitious- to a fault. I don&#039;t want to criticize a show for having big dreams and wanting to achieve something more, but sadly, if the show is not going to do what it needs to to achieve what it wants to, I will criticize it. Attempting to comment on every societal issue there is and trying to tackle all types of heavy themes, WEP tries to cover everything it can, but it doesn&#039;t do it properly. Following an egg of the week format that&#039;s already enough of a bore, it introduces new heavy and dark themes every episode, and does nothing with them bar the very minimal. The themes that are presented and brought forward i.e bullying, abuse, sexual harassment and assault, anxiety, depression, idol culture, parenthood, self-interest, and many more, are just lying in the storyboard as concepts that have no expansion. Not even the central themes of the story like &quot;The temptation of death&quot; are properly given the depth they deserve and depth you would expect them to have.<br />
<br />
After how much emphasis was put on bullying and its effects in the first episode, you would expect the anime to do something with it, expand it, showcase different perspectives and arrive at a conclusion that would fit the main character, but what does it do? It makes a big deal out of it, but then discards it immediately after. It&#039;s just &quot;Oh I was bullied but now I&#039;m fine.&quot; And EP 12 did try to expand on it but it failed miserably because it didn&#039;t go any further than what it had already said in EP 1, &quot;Bullying can lead to suicide guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg takes it&#039;s viewers for fools, and looking at the reception it has gotten, it might have hit the mark. Blatant symbolism that is shoved into the viewer&#039;s face, constant spelling out of the events and characterization. The viewers, however, instead of finding these flaws, eat them up. Wonder Egg spells out everything- and spoon feeds it&#039;s ideas. How do we know that Ai was pretending to not notice the bullying? A character spells it out. How do we know that Ai was deluding herself? A character spells it out. How do we know that Ai likes the teacher? A character spells it out. How do we know that Ai is doing this for herself? A character spells it out.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d like to dedicate a paragraph to EP 2 as it was the worst episode of the series by far. The entire episode was one big eye roll. Oh, we introduce the theme of pursuing a goal as a pretense for self-satisfaction in the most random way possible. By the way, abuse is bad. How do we know? A character flat-out says it word-for-word. Here&#039;s some anticlimactic action and melodrama that has no weight behind it. By the way, this character is probably suicidal, how do we know? Well a character flat out says she wants to die. <br />
<br />
Acca and Ura-Acca are infuriating additions to the story as they have no role besides dumping information and exposition while constantly spelling out Ai&#039;s character.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not necessarily alluding every exposition done through dialogue to be heavy handed or lacking (Case in point ReZero or Monogatari) but the way it handles it is very telling of what audience it wants to appeal to. <br />
<br />
You might say the characters of WEP are what makes the show shine, but I&#039;d be the first to disagree. The characters aren&#039;t handled well at the most basic of levels because of how less clarity is given regarding them, and even when they are, they aren&#039;t characterized anywhere below the surface level intertwined themes and character motivations. Might I go a bit off topic here, but I once saw a comment somewhere on YT, which read &quot;Rika&#039;s self-harm tendencies are the most accurate and unique representation of how real people self-harm.&quot; (Of course this is paraphrasing but this is close enough to what they actually said.) And you know what? That definitely got me going, I wanted to see what Wonder Egg did that stood out from other pieces of media depicting self harm. And then, all my expectations were met with disappointment when I realized that no more than a few lines of dialogue were dedicated to depicting her self-harm issues. &quot;I won&#039;t cut anymore. I promised.&quot;, I think, was what the comment was referring to. And while it is accurate to some extent… it&#039;s bland. People not being able to let go of their addictions isn&#039;t a unique thing to be presented in fictional media, and it definitely is stale considering how broad of a range self-harm has. Self-harm could&#039;ve been depicted as something that Rika took pleasure in, because it distracted her from the issues she was having with her mother- and she could&#039;ve learned to get over it, and rely on her friends for help, but no, we got none of the sort. Neiru was introduced with the theme of pursuing a goal as a pretense for self-satisfaction… but that issue was never expanded upon. Her probable suicidal tendencies were never mentioned again, nor was her self-love (or act of it) she oh-so-proudly boasted. Momoe could&#039;ve been a good character. Keyword: Could&#039;ve. Her character arc ended where it began, with no trials or tribulations along the way, and she was rendered of no more use in episode 10. Ai&#039;s character had one outstanding moment (EP 6) but that was definitely anti-climactic considering how her shut-in tendencies were built up from the very first episode. (And they&#039;re never mentioned again by the way.) Ai&#039;s character was expanded upon a bit further in EP 12, with Alt-Ai and what she could&#039;ve been like- but it&#039;s nothing new to see in fictional media plus it was executed horribly with it being a clusterfuck with no meaning. It aimed for something that would feature the culmination of Ai&#039;s entire character- akin to say, Evangelion, but what it did was the exact opposite.The characters, all of them, are characterized by shallow words and actions. The issues, problems and &quot;inner demons&quot; of the characters don&#039;t feel real- as they are resolved way too quickly and never gone in-depth into. They have an episode or two to themselves that doesn&#039;t provide any depth to them beyond the surface level. One might say, &quot;Oh, but this is only a 1-cour series, you can&#039;t expect the characters to be that fleshed out.&quot; And to that I say, look at Ping Pong The Animation. It has a similarly structured narrative, is a 1-cour series, and has 4-5 main characters it focuses on, yet it still manages to flesh them out with every bit of dialogue, with every bit of symbolism, and with every bit of their actions. The characters in Wonder Egg are hollow shells coated with a shade that&#039;s illuminating enough that will distract you from the lacking inside. <br />
<br />
Character dynamics and relationships, for me, are detrimental in the telling of a good story. Literary dynamics between the characters such as parallels, contrasts, foils etc respective of the other, help in putting different perspectives of them onto you. How the characters play off of each other, what kind of relationship they have, how it came to be, how it&#039;s progressing, what it is like now and much more. All of them add an entire layer of believability and depth to a story. Wonder Egg- as much as people fawn over cute girls bonding- didn&#039;t hit the nail in this regard. Wonder Egg with its characters and the dynamics they share with others, remains lazy throughout. Using text messages as a way to show their progression really is telling of how lazy they were regarding building dynamics. It doesn&#039;t give us enough time to get invested, or even make it believable, and starts dumping the friendship talk. Apparently all you need to do to get people praising your story is have a character say anything along the lines of &quot;We&#039;re here for you.&quot;, &quot;Friends are supposed to be there for each other.&quot; It&#039;s shallow, doesn&#039;t have any emotional punch because of the lack of build up and is nothing but feel-bait. <br />
<br />
Now, the plot. Wonder Egg does not have a let alone good, decent story-line. The plot is riddled with holes, conveniences, inconsistencies and lack of clarity. And just like its themes, Wonder Egg is ambitious to a fault, with it&#039;s plot as well. It introduces concepts of parallel universes, a sci-fi setting at the very last second and others that obviously, need, you know, to be expanded upon. But you know the drill by now, it does absolutely nothing or the bare minimum with them. One thing I&#039;d have wanted WEP to do, which it didn&#039;t, would be introduce the concept of quantum immortality. It blatantly dropped a bomb saying parallel universes exist, so why not take that, and use it to your advantage? Quantum immortality basically renders every suicide attempt as useless so it&#039;d be a great concept of &quot;Death is ultimately meaningless.&quot; Added but sadly, it did nothing of the sort. Parallel universes worked as a way to introduce another Ai that had committed suicide because Koito hadn&#039;t came into her life, but what we got out of the meeting was stuff about Koito we already knew and a rushed and stale conclusion for Ai&#039;s character. Events happen in the blink of an eye, immediately followed by another, not giving the viewer&#039;s any time to breathe. The plot-twists that happen around the end lack any substance or build up and only give us more questions without answering prior ones. (I don&#039;t want to speak too soon on this as there is still an episode that&#039;s left to come out, but I definitely don&#039;t have trust that they will be able to answer everything while providing satisfactory character conclusions for everyone and the whole plot.)<br />
<br />
Symbolism. You love symbolism, I love symbolism. Symbolism isn&#039;t inherently a thing that makes a story a whole lot better. For me, symbolism is the cherry on top. If it&#039;s there, that&#039;s great, I&#039;ll gobble it up, but if it isn&#039;t there, well, I&#039;ll make do with the cake and feel that nothing is necessarily lacking. Wonder Egg&#039;s use of symbolism is… not good, to say the least. If I could describe it, Wonder Egg&#039;s symbolism is like a rotten cherry but with no cake underneath. Symbolism is the use of symbols, whether made up or already existing in real life, used to retell events that have happened in the story, is happening or events that will happen, in a subtle way. Keyword: Subtle. Wonder Egg is not subtle, at all. &quot;Seenoevils&quot; after it&#039;s made clear that Ai is pretending to not notice the bullying, or &quot;Haters&quot; after how we see Rika being involved in idol work are the perfect example of the blatant symbolism it provides. One of the very first things we see in episode 1 is a Moth, symbolising rebirth, and it&#039;s the same Moth we see in EP 12, as spelled out clearly by Ai because the story doesn&#039;t have enough trust in its viewers to connect the dots. Wonder Egg doesn&#039;t know which extreme it wants to lie on- either being too vague with their symbolism to the point where it becomes an eye-roll to figure it out, or being too blatant with it to the point where it becomes an eye-roll to witness it.<br />
<br />
I will admit, though, that WEP has its moments of genius. Regarding episode 6, I like how they made the egg boss invisible because no one believed (cared) about the girl&#039;s ability to see ghosts (and other stuff) which is just one big metaphor for anxiety and what it can drive a person to. And just as Ai recalls her own anxieties about school and Koito, she understands what the girl was saying, what she was going through when she was alive, and then she&#039;s finally able to see the boss. Her saying &quot;I can&#039;t be your friend.&quot; To the boss basically means &quot;I can&#039;t keep drowning in my anxieties.&quot; And later on in the episode, after a much needed thoughtful stretch for her future, she emerges out of the water and dashes towards the teacher. Keep in mind that the teacher was visualised in heavy rain earlier in the episode which signified how whatever subject matter surrounded the teacher, whether it be Koito or school, was always something of displeasure for Ai. And while she arrives at the teacher and says how she&#039;s going to continue going to school now, the rain stops. &quot;The sky is clear now.&quot; Meaning &quot;Your doubts have been washed away.&quot; And &quot;It was just a passing shower.&quot; Meaning &quot;The moment you sulked and were down was but a phase.&quot; <br />
<br />
The last 5 minutes of the episode were built upon snippets of flashbacks and moments in the domain of children- that, in a fluid and believable way, led to the climax.<br />
<br />
There are sequences like these that are done well, and that take full advantage of subtle yet coherent symbolism, and subtext in between dialogue (Although not executed perfectly)… but they sadly, they don&#039;t as much as even start to cover up the flaws all around it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Peering inside the egg; A hollow shell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg is exactly what is the problem with the anime industry nowadays, there was a review on it that read, &quot;The characters aren&#039;t one-dimensional or stereotypical, they have their own backstories and inner demons.&quot; For reasoning as to why the characters are good. If not being one-dimensional is the bar we, as anime fans, set to consider a character good, then obviously, that&#039;s what the anime industry is going to provide us. WEP is the culmination of what the problem is with the anime industry, and people are gobbling it up, ignorant. The only good thing Angel&#039;s Egg&#039;s trend of obscurism brought us was Evangelion. Stuff like SEL and FLCL, while still not a good product in my eyes, provide something to the anime industry, capitalize on the trend while still twisting it in their own way, and dive straight in and deep into what they want to achieve, whether it will come out as a coherent product or not, and if not anything, I can condemn them for trying to do so. Not WEP, it pertains towards heavy topics and touches them, but is afraid to delve into them and it also expects praise for doing so. Quite frankly, it&#039;s pandering and cowardly.<br />
<br />
When I look back on Wonder Egg as a whole, I find it to be of hardly any value. Wonder Egg is not a finished product; it&#039;s a half-assed story that has an identity crisis all over. It shoots for the stars while never considering, for a moment, how to get there. It wants to make the viewer&#039;s think that it is a show of value, something with deeper meaning, and something that deserves artistic merit- while doing absolutely nothing that would warrant them any such praise. <br />
<br />
Wonder Egg Priority started out as an egg, brimming with potential- but ended a hollow shell- devoid of any substance.<br />

    How would you describe &quot;Wonder Egg Priority&quot; in one word? &quot;UNIQUE&quot; would be my first thought. What is it all about? Let’s be honest, it&#039;s really hard to put it into words. Bully, hate, love, friendship etc. all these important aspects of our life play a major role. “Wonder Egg Priority” isn&#039;t just an anime, it&#039;s a life lesson.<br />
<br />
Bullying is one of the worst things that can happen to someone. It takes away all your “joie de vivre”, often leading to suicide in the end. The pain is extremely deep when this person was very important to you. How far would you go to save

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388194">
        and &quot;relive&quot; such a human being?<br />
<br />
&quot;Break open an egg to change yourself and your future.&quot;<br />
Our wonder story begins with Ai Ohto, a kinda special girl compared to her other classmates. Because of her heterochromia (color differences of the iris) she gets bullied a lot in school. Therefore, she hides at home and doesn&#039;t want to have anything to do with other people. Initially, she did not think having friends was important and put in little effort to make them. However, she eventually made friends with the transfer student Koito Nagase, who was similarly ostracized by their classmates. After Koito took her own life, Ai feels very guilty and for Koito’s sake she was ready to fight in the world of &quot;Wonder Eggs&quot;.<br />
As the word &quot;wonder&quot; suggests, these eggs aren’t just ordinary eggs that we buy every day in the supermarket. They include a person who must be protected at all costs from the &quot;wonder killers&quot;, those are terrifying creatures who want to kill that person. If you manage this mission successfully, you are one step closer to rescuing your loved one.<br />
Ai was the first girl to take on this brave task and fight all sorts of monsters. This was a lifechanging event for her since she met other girls who also had to go through a lot in life and lost an important reference person before. With Neiru Aonuma, Rika Kawai and Momoe Sawaki a quartet emerged that not only support each other in the egg thing, but also as friends in real life. Even if the whole situation was overwhelming and just crazy at first, they were able to keep going through help from each other.<br />
Neiru is calm and quiet, often not actively engaging with others until they’ve gained her trust or her friendship. She is a hardworking, motivated, and diligent person. Although she is still young, Neiru is already the president of a large company. Her goal is to save her little sister and her background story is extraordinary…<br />
“I&#039;m Rika Kawai. Like &quot;kawaii,&quot; &#039;cause I&#039;m so cute.” Rika was once a junior idol who was part of an underground idol group. She met a fan who did everything to support her there. Her most loyal fan, Chiemi, did steal and other crimes for Rika. But one day Rika did an act that she regrets more than anything else. She called Chiemi &quot;fatty&quot; and never wanted to be seen with her again. Rika felt very guilty about this and understood the cruelty of bullying. She wants to protect her eggs so that she can make up for everything she did.<br />
Let&#039;s take a look at the last main character: Momoe. She is a kind and polite girl, who is well-liked by many she meets. Momoe is very insecure about herself because of her masculine appearance. She is often mistaken for a boy, which is why many women fall in love with her. The only girl treated Momoe like a female person was her friend Haruka. She also confessed her love to her, but she was attracted by the feminine side of Momoe. Overwhelming of that, Momoe was so shocked that she dumped her and ran away. A short time later the disaster happened…<br />
Every single character in Wonder Egg Priority plays an important role. Not only the people from the hatching eggs have a unique story, but also our two companions Acca and Ura-Acca. They are the one who introduced the girls to the &quot;Egg World&quot;. In that world they are depicted as mannequins, but there was a time where both had a human form...All in all, the characters and the whole setting are definitely the elements where you want to know more about.<br />
<br />
The story is already crazy enough and yet &quot;CloverWorks&quot; manages to add even more spice with the animation. Every girl has her own weapon, the form of those are more than just unusual. The fought monsters cannot be surpassed in creativity either. The epic battles with them are also portrayed in a brutal way that is definitely different from other animations.<br />
The special creativity is shown again in the OP and ED. “Wonder Egg Priority” is based on many real locations in Tokyo. The transition from a real photo to the animation is the absolute highlight. A story, a moral and decisions with grave consequences develop from a simple egg. The small music group &quot;Anemoneria&quot; consisting of our four main characters has also found the perfect music and song for this.<br />
The rest of the sounds, be it the environment or scenes where blood flows, everything fits.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;Wonder Egg Priority&quot; in the end? To be honest, I can&#039;t answer it and I don’t know if there is a clear answer. It&#039;s so crazy and messy in a way that you can&#039;t get enough of it and 12 episode is certainly not enough to tell the whole story. But I agree that this anime is the seasonal sensation in terms of surprise. I never expected a plot like this. There is much more to it than just a simple anime, it also addresses important topics to us that we all have to take very seriously.<br />
It is difficult to say whether this anime is something for you, as opinions are very divided on it. But I can recommend everyone to take a look, you will immediately notice that this is something special.<br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to emphasize again: “Wonder Egg Priority” is UNIQUE.<br />
