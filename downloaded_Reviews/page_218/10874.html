    Story: The plot is basically a ongoing war between two generic nations, with the black nation having a tyrannical king that doesn&#039;t give a sh1t for his nation. The white nation although isn&#039;t tyrannical, they are nonetheless boring as f*ck and are bias into thinking that being white is righteous. Though they learn that the people of the black nation are being forced into war. There is also no reason stating why the tyrannical king of darkness is going on a rampage, I swear if it&#039;s some bullsh*t stating that murder is justice or if it&#039;s something that appeases him, then I&#039;m calling it quits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337471">
        on this show. Anyway this looks like it&#039;s gonna be a   garbage romance story between two lovers with the relationship development  being resolved with fight scenes that saves one or the other. 2/10<br />
<br />
Art: Really generic looking and nothing much about it at all. Your highness looks like your typical maiden beauty, while the MC lead looks like your typical edgelord character you would create ingame. Character designs are so generic that it holds no significance at all. 5/10<br />
<br />
Sound: The OP is kind of a banger tbh. Takahiro Nishikawa x ASCA hits it off pretty good as the switches between the two reflects the premise of the show. The ED is pretty soothing and aesthetically pleasing and is also a banger. For the voice acting part, this may be some of the most mediocre acting I&#039;ve ever noticed. The monster that constantly lays a rampage with no definitive reason is the worst va I&#039;ve heard tbh. 6/10<br />
<br />
Character: Ok this is where it gets boring. First of all the princess maiden is nothing more than a random character that you fill in for the plot. She has close to zero personality at all, except for looking at things different than what most of her kingdom thinks. I wouldn&#039;t even go any further on the kingdom of white because they are so bland and generic that you would literally be better off skipping their part because it&#039;s insignificant. For the black kingdom with actual plot development we have the Prince of Darkness, who is a commoner that has suffered a heart-breaking loss as his village was destroyed by monsters. I don&#039;t want to further expose what happens here, but someone came and told him that he reminds him of his former self and told him to take his sword and become king. From what happen there the commoner then takes his place and declares himself as the Prince of Darkness who strives to become king and reform his nation. There&#039;s literally no personality for these characters, they literally act like every other normie protagonist that I can&#039;t even give any of these characters credit. I&#039;m gonna have to throw these lazy personalities in the G-tier for Generically uninspiring. Yeah, I get the reason for the goals they are striving for, but these characters has been told so many times that it&#039;s not even enjoyable anymore like seriously, how lazy can one be in writing. Also why does that white knight always get mad when someone mentions the princess, like jesus christ he doesn&#039;t follow the mood at all, despicable. 2/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment???: The only entertaining part of the show is the black kingdom only. The white kingdom is equivalent to the amount of ecchi/cliche/filler you have watched for a lifetime. Even though the only enjoyable part was the black kingdom, it is still so predictable and straightforward with it&#039;s plot that there is nothing worth mentioning except for the fact that the Prince of Darkness will accomplish anything to become king and save his people. 3/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10 <br />
<br />
*Such cliche storytelling, makes it so uninspiring

    When you see the words &quot;GAME adaptation&quot;, there are a list of catalysts in mind: decent story plot and characters from the game (that&#039;s if you ever played the game before), decent visuals and generally good music (because if you cannot sell the show, at least sell the music to make up the profit). And that&#039;s Shironeko Project in a nutshell, but with a sharp decline in almost every category. And unfortunately, most of what&#039;s here is total garbage and a waste of time and money (which the anime industry STILL hasn&#039;t learnt their lesson and kept it that way), unlike the boisterous amount of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345074">
        game adaptations in this season (5 to be exact, including this one). And before you ask, the game&#039;s no better too, just a very generic tactical RPG.<br />
<br />
First of all, who&#039;d think that the cliché &quot;Light vs. Darkness / Black vs. White&quot; Romeo and Juliet-esque&quot; would sell the show? I&#039;d give you a clap if you generally enjoyed this despite the lack of content, but for such a &quot;story&quot;, it was squandered of its potentials and squeezed of almost every trope you can think of. Heck, the only thing that I can say was unique is on the side of darkness, something like an underdog story of sorts. That is fine and all, but the rest was a total misfire. The two kingdoms being forced into war is a given, but the sequence of events that conspired and transformed the &quot;forces of nature&quot; was just so dumb a.k.a &quot;the war started because of somebody&#039;s ill-fated conflict&quot;. Needless to say, this was one of the worst and boring stories I&#039;ve watched so far, much from a low-expected game adaptation anyways.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the characters, much of the weight on their shoulders, playing the &quot;Balance of Power&quot; trope. It&#039;s &quot;fantasy fiction&quot; I geddit, but in the right hands, is a power play and crucial plot onto itself (sans One Piece, Beezlebub etc.). But Shironeko Project just managed to have a very lackluster character cast that are nothing more than &quot;support&quot; positions (I don&#039;t really care if that character is playing the king/queen, it&#039;s one and the same), much less its vibe going for it being &quot;I must uphold the balance between my kingdom and yours, to acquire peace no matter the hardship between the two kingdoms.&quot; That just about turns most people off.<br />
<br />
But same like the story, I do commend the underdog story of the Prince of Darkness, first a regular commoner and fighting to be in the position that he&#039;s in now through thick and thin, a battle against other people that could be in his position that of the one who&#039;s to be in the position, will uphold responsibility for peace-sake. But the aftermath of like guides trying to control his every move, that part I didn&#039;t really like (which begs the question: if you&#039;re gonna be the protagonist, be a man/woman of your word and don&#039;t be a parrot to others). Similar to the story, bland and boring characters (which I always miss who&#039;s who, so that&#039;s a consolation).<br />
<br />
And the animation, sorely lackluster as expected of the low-budget standards of Project No. 9. It&#039;s not as bad when compared to some other shows that use a mix of 2D and 3DCG for action and such, but it was just eerily missing its punches and kicks the whole time treading around. Generic character designs don&#039;t really help much to get invested right off the bat, as to be expected. I never had high expectations for game adaptations to shine, but this did in the worst of levels possible (which after watching so many boring anime based on game adaptations, I&#039;ve grown completely numb to it).<br />
<br />
What&#039;s the &quot;silver lining in the clouds&quot;, is the music. I&#039;ve said it before time and time again: if the show flops, the music sells. And this is kinda the best of the bunch though. An alright banger of an OP (by T.M.Revolution Takaniro Nishikawa and ASCA), plus a really good ED by Rei Yasuda, both which are solid songs in my opinion to get through the pumping and emotional feels for the somewhat un-inspiration of the overall narrative of the show. Plus, even with high-profile VAs (such as Yui Horie and KajiKaji), their voice talents lent to this show was decent, or at worse mediocre. Alas, the music is only the highlight and nothing more.<br />
<br />
I think I needn&#039;t say more if my ranting is to persuade people to stay away from this BS of a &quot;game adaptation&quot;, because it is just that and nothing more: a hollow shell with a decrepited plot so bad I just want to completely shut down and finish the show for good (and finish it I did). To the uphill at the start, but to the downhill at the end.

    Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is one of the most entertaining anime of the Spring 2020 season. It&#039;s not a good anime, and you&#039;ll only be met with disappointment if you expect otherwise. It&#039;s a very bad anime, and that&#039;s exactly what makes it worth watching. There&#039;s plenty of bad anime every season, but what sets this one apart from all of its contemporaries is the massive scope of its narrative, which makes its glorious failure of execution all the more brilliant. <br />
<br />
This anime is a prequel to the 2014 mobile game Shironeko Project, hence the &quot;Zero Chronicle&quot;, but that&#039;s not important. It&#039;s an entirely standalone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345835">
        story (aside from a flash forward nod to the game in an after-credits cut), and what a story it is. Basically, there&#039;s these two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Darkness, which, surprisingly, don&#039;t get along with each other. The protagonist, named The Prince of Darkness, is, surprisingly, the Pr-nah, I won&#039;t make that joke. So blah blah a little bit and you get a Shakespearean love tale between The Prince of Darkness and the Iris, the Queen of Light, set to the backdrop of the most Final Fantasy-y Final Fantasy story that never existed. The most notable part of Shironeko&#039;s story is the sheer variety of plot events, and the pinball pace with which it moves through all of them. In one episode, the fate of the world will rest on the outcome of an epic battle between godlike entities, and the next, the cast get together to frolic in the woods and pick berries and fall on each other into rivers, only to emerge soaked and embarrassed, as you do. Sections like these occasionally clash with the show&#039;s lengthy and poorly animated action sequences, but they do come with the advantage of letting the characters do their thing without any unenthusiastic explosions or cheap looking digital effects to interrupt them. <br />
<br />
Which is a good thing because the characters are the highlight of the Shironeko experience. Again, our main character is The Prince of Darkness, The Prince of Darkness. You could call him a kuudere, but really his defining trait is that he&#039;s the main character. The highest praise I can give him is that he&#039;s not nearly as edgy as his appearance suggests. Iris is the female lead and deuteragonist. Interestingly enough, for being a western-style royal in a shitty anime, she doesn&#039;t behave like most of her peers. Honestly, she&#039;s really not that awful. She&#039;s powerful, she doesn&#039;t do anything too annoying, her mannerisms are a little cute in an old-lady-on-the-inside kind of way; all-in-all, she&#039;s a serviceable waifu (or that could just be the work of Yui Horie&#039;s vocal ASMR hypnosis). What really sold me on finishing this show, however, were the side characters. Groza is a green-haired milf general from the Kingdom of Darkness. I don&#039;t know if she&#039;s actually a milf or not, if this were any other anime, she&#039;d definitely be a milf though. She has a quintessential fantasy milf design, but it&#039;s contrasted by the pure, innocent, almost virginal schoolgirl crush she has on the Prince. She comes with a retinue of bodyguards, and let me tell you, those guys MAKE the show, easily the best characters, they&#039;re the biggest reason the story feels so Shakespearean. They&#039;re basically Shironeko&#039;s version of the comic relief commoners. There&#039;s four of them, they all look exactly the same (although one is the leader), and they&#039;re the only ones in the show that are intentionally funny, I was shocked that such high quality characters wormed their way into such a low quality work. Not far behind them though is the captain of the Knights of Light, Phallus- or excuse me, Phious. He&#039;s great because his voice actor isn&#039;t, and when that&#039;s partnered with poor voice direction and a character that&#039;s written to be a dickhead, you get a convincing performance of a knuckle-dragging nutjob prone to socially-inappropriate outbursts of emotion. Groza&#039;s guards aren&#039;t around often, so he&#039;s the one who carries the show the most. There&#039;s also another Kingdom of Light shota who I&#039;m pretty sure goes through a whole character arc across the season, but I just remember him because he&#039;s a shota with a male VA who sounds 15, looks 12, and says things a 6 year old would say. There’re a couple others, like Adel the Darkness bro and Sima the fembro, but their abnormality comes from the status quo of the show rather than any qualities or personality traits special to them. One thing I should mention is that the dialogue in this show is so bizarre, or stilted, or otherwise unnatural, that, even though every single character is some sort of trope or archetype, the things they say are so weird that it elevates them to a level of uniqueness you won&#039;t find even in some high profile shows, right down to the random sassy street merchants.<br />
<br />
And I&#039;d be remiss if I didn&#039;t go into detail about the production quality either. As expected, it&#039;s not good. Shironeko has a heavy reliance on fights, but none of the animation capability to follow through on that. There is one sakuga sequence in the whole show. It lasts less than two seconds, and the extremely overdone character designs had to be reduced to a composition of simple shapes to enable it. Other noteworthy moments include a sword duel wherein two characters stood still for several seconds in the likeness of Rock &#039;Em Sock &#039;Em Robots to bang their swords together like when you played Star Wars with meter sticks in 4th grade, and a scene that obviously took inspiration from the visual genius of Studio Trigger by having a static image of a character dragged across the frame to convey the act of grappling up a cliff. By the end of the season, even continuity was too much to ask for, as characters changed appearance on a cut-by-cut basis. <br />
<br />
The only things consistent about Shironeko were my feelings toward as I followed it weekly. I remember watching the first episode as soon as it was released and getting excited because I&#039;d witnessed what I thought would be the worst anime of the season. Listeners snatched that achievement away after a few weeks, but my genuine admiration for Shironeko&#039;s entertaining awfulness never faded as I watched more and more of it. When I finished the final episode and witnessed the expectedly terrible ending, I felt a pang of melancholy, more so than I did with Yesterday wo Utatte, Kakushigoto, or any of the other seasonal highlights. I don&#039;t know how many of my feelings will be shared by the average viewer, but if you have any interest at all in bad anime, Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is a must watch.<br />

    First few episodes were kinda hit and miss, but I will say that this series has grown on me quite a lot. It&#039;s mainly down to the story if anything. Here is why!<br />
<br />
The idea of light vs darkness is really interesting. Really is. It&#039;s the classic story of good vs evil, something that you might have seen so many times. It&#039;s done alright here, started off iffy, but really picked up as the episodes went on. As if there is a real feel of tension, that really adds more to the shows story in general.<br />
<br />
The characters...Some are alright, like they&#039;re not bad characters, but some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338328">
        do feel a kind of eh feeling. But they&#039;re alright enough to not really pull down the show at all. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll grow as the show goes on.<br />
<br />
The art and music are pretty nice, they really shine in the light&#039;s kingdom, but then gloomy and such in the darkness area. Really well done there. The music fits each scene too. Props to the show there, they really know how to set the tone right.<br />
<br />
All in all, it&#039;s a decent show, not super imrpessive, but it does its job so far. Give it a shot!

    If you have the free time to watch this anime, it is most likely a better use of your time to learn another language for those time than watching this anime. TLDR: for me, this was one of the worst series I have ever watched. (I have never given any series a rating of 1 until this anime).<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Somewhat overused setting. Princess and prince of dark and light trying to coexist, but they are constantly at war. You will understand the premise if you watch the first 5 minutes of this series. <br />
The pacing is bad, and the ending is super rushed. If this series cut

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345160">
        out the middle 5 episode, and used that 5 episode for actual story, maybe this rating would not be a 1. There were alot of random fillers that didn&#039;t offer anything to the story.<br />
This is a game adaptation, but the story did not convince me to try the game at all.<br />
Note: the summary listed in MAL is very misleading.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It&#039;s nothing special. No depth of any kind, and very generic looking characters. The background is even worse. I know this is a game adaption (never played the game), and this art did not convince me to try out this game.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
same as the art. Very generic, and the same sound is used over and over again. There a scenes where you feel somewhat hyped, but the art/story and event just lets you down everyime.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I can&#039;t even tell who is important in this series. Random &quot;character development&quot; (ie looking into past) in some episode. Honestly, there wasn&#039;t any character that I felt attached to in the slightest<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Took me 2 hours to watch each episode because I fell asleep. Sums up the entire series. There has been alot of series where it wasn&#039;t really good, but there were 1 or 2 scenes where it was cool. I wan&#039;t able to find any in this series.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Don&#039;t bother watching this. At first, I thought that there were some inside stories I am missing, or this series may have been for the fans of the game. A good example is Bang Dreams. However, after watching 12 episodes, I genuinely think it was just bad. If there is anyone who is a fan of this game and think differently, please let me know.  It is possible I just missed the entire series.

    STORY: I can only grasp the basis of this story. Four episodes in and there&#039;s nothing, except character introduction. I do understand the concept of &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Dark&quot;; &quot;Sky&quot; and &quot;Earth&quot;, but giving us the concept does not lead to a potential good story. This is either a very generic war and love story, or we are just at the beginning of something nice. Either way, it&#039;s not catching attention on any of the viewers. <br />
<br />
The art is decent and the characters look good. They have potential to be likable. <br />
I find it really lovely that they are showing us ten minutes of background every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338419">
        episode to make us see the difference between the two worlds. Not like the colors are helping already, but OK.<br />
<br />
SOUND: I have to be honest. I never heard such bad voice acting. There&#039;s one particular scene where a terrible monster appears shouting. and it&#039;s the voice of a 60 year old man howling. Please even if I don&#039;t recommend you to watch this, I think you should go to episode 2/3 and check that terrible voice. Regarding the other voice actors, it&#039;s pretty normal, but there&#039;s just a terrible writing, that you can&#039;t even focus on the dialogues. <br />
<br />
The characters are just weird. They look like they don&#039;t have a brain. And I got to blame the writing. Like they look cool/cute/whatever you want to call it, but every time they speak or say something, it just makes them look dumb as hell and clearly unlikable. <br />
<br />
I look very frustrating with what I wrote and I want to say that before writing this, I had a pretty 50/50 opinion on this anime, but then I just remembered parts of it and thought &quot; Wow this was terrible and I don&#039;t understand why people are watching this&quot;. <br />
<br />
This is just my preliminary opinion. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to be so expressive when I didn&#039;t even finish it. So I&#039;m going to TRY to finish it and then come back. Sorry.

    This anime made me come back to this website after 5 years of inactivity.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m only writing this review because the first Half of the Anime was OK although completely blasted with Cliche&#039;s. After EP 6-8 everything just turns to complete bull.<br />
I don&#039;t know what the creators thought they where doing, but I&#039;m sure it was based on a story where they had to cut out like 75% of the content. And you can clearly feel that while watching.<br />
This Anime goes from Adventure to Politics to Slice of Life to Apocalyptic Scenarios and Tragedy in the span of 1 Episode and not in a good way...<br />
<br />
Animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345227">
        is OK, they put in &quot;some&quot; effort. The fight scenes are meh too but it wasn&#039;t about the fight scenes anyways. Although there was a high emphasis on it, specially in the last EPs. It was definitely a low budged animation so I&#039;m not going to complain more. This was really the least of the issues.<br />
<br />
Premise: Blacks and Whites Kingdoms are at war since &quot;always&quot; (Yes this is the very, very, stupid name they have decided on....)<br />
There is the King of Blacks, (King of Darkness) who tries to unify the world by covering it in Darkness  &gt;Of course he doesn&#039;t, he&#039;s planning to destroy everything, duh&lt;<br />
The Princess (Head of the White&#039;s Kingdom and the Queen of Light)<br />
Also the MC who is the Prince and the next Ruler in line.<br />
The Anime centres around the peace treaty the blacks and whites want to establish to stop the endless bloodshed and suffering. That&#039;s it. of course this goes to shit at some point in the story and &quot;shit hits the fan, not just because a lot of stuff happens to incite tragedy, but because the story is also shit.<br />
<br />
Now about the Characters<br />
<br />
The 2 Main characters, the Black Prince and White Princess, are the embodiment of cliches and so turns out to be the story,<br />
<br />
The Male MC&#039;s place of life gets destroyed by demons and through some situations decides to become the next ruler of the &quot;kingdom&quot;. He becomes the next successor in line for the &quot;black&quot; Kingdom and goes on an envoy mission with another, a former successor candidate, to the &quot;White&#039;s kingdom&quot; together with best girl Groza.<br />
The romance in this story is in my opinion very garbage, There was almost 0 reason for the MC to fall in love with the Princess, but he does this on first sight.<br />
Minor Spoiler:<br />
There was also 0 reason for the MC to suddenly get a Powerup in the last Episode. He just suddenly does. Most of the stuff the MC does makes usually 0 reason so it wasn&#039;t surprising at all.<br />
<br />
The Princess, Iris: Super Cliche. Just another boring character who wants to protect her kingdom in a stupid and altruistic fashion. There is not much to this. Her family/friends are just as bad and cliche; &quot;best female friend&quot; who is the head priestess and &quot;best male friend who has a crush on her&quot; and is the head knight. The writing for them was just as boring as it was for the Princess, so I&#039;m not even going to elaborate on it. Heck, the little ~10 year old brother of the Priestess and Knight has more character development than any other character in this series with his 5 minutes of total screen-time...)<br />
The only character trait the princess has is that she likes gardening and self sacrifice, which she does from EP 01 to 12.<br />
<br />
Groza (best girl): An executive of the &quot;Darks&quot; (more like a secretary). She basically carries the story in a lot of situations. from the first time she was introduced she fell for the MC (he saved her life on a whim... cliche I know.). She supports the MC in every situation and helps lighten the mood of this otherwise very boring show. I&#039;m not going to elaborate a lot on her because as you may realise in the first 2-3 episodes: She was obviously only added to the story to get trashed aside by the MC later on for the princess, but this is something they always do in any trash-tier Anime nowadays, so I knew this immediately when I saw the first EP. (she stood no chance against the shitty writing of the creators). She of course doesn&#039;t get much screen time after a point and has no chance whatsoever to have her romantic desire bloom. (At least she gets rejected by the MC properly. Thinking about it, it was a lot better for her to not get together with this trash-tier MC.)<br />
<br />
There is also the other messenger from the &quot;blacks&quot; who lost against MC in the battle for succession, but he&#039;s written just as bad as everyone and has a very stupid fate.<br />
<br />
I was expecting it to end similar to what it did, but they somehow made it even worse than I thought.<br />
<br />
The final scene also shows a kind of open end with chance of a continuation, but I really hope this doesn&#039;t get a 2nd season. (If you loved this series, I&#039;m sorry but the story was just bad in my opinion)<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
- Did I enjoy this series? __Yes__, from EP 1 to 8. <br />
- Would I recommend it? No.<br />
- Does it have good waifus? They are okay. If you somehow really like the princess the most I&#039;m concerned about your mental health.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t forget that this is just my opinion. I watch about 5 - 10 Anime every season with my favourite tags being Adventure, Action or Comedy. I&#039;m also a Waifu Hunter so this may or may not have influenced my review of this. English is my 3rd language.

    This review may contain spoilers!!!:<br />
<br />
<br />
*Story:The plot seems to be the most unoriginal Goddess clan vs demon clan.<br />
Oh i mean the original and so interresting kingdom of white vs the kingdom of darkness where the two kigdoms are at war but they stopped fighting and made an alliance to defeat this op character named &quot;bahl&quot;(Which is probably the worst anime character i saw in 2020).And this plot seems to be building up for a romance sub-plot between the two nations rulers.<br />
5 episodes in and the anime has no relation with the synopsis written on MAL, and tbh, i don&#039;t know and i can&#039;t predict where the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339190">
        story is going after ep5.<br />
So i might change my opinin since this plot can get better, or it can go down hill wich is the most dominant probability.<br />
Basically, the story appears to be a walmart version of &quot;Seven deadly sins&quot;<br />
*Sound: The op and ed were great and i really liked them.<br />
also the VA doesn&#039;t sound forced . Finally, i didn&#039;t pay attention to the OSTs, so, there PROBABLY wasn&#039;t any misplaced OSTs, and yet they PROBABLY were not good either since i can&#039;t remmeber them.<br />
*Art: I really didn&#039;t like the characters &#039; designs, and the animation is mediocre.<br />
*Characters: The characters are horrible. Their designs looked like any other generic fantasy anime character. Moreover, most of the characters if not all of them are superfacial and boring and there is no development to be found in their personalities, the only one that got a little bit of development was that prince of darkness dude. And don&#039;t get me started talking about bahl, he was the only character who had a trait in his  personality that differentiated him from the others, however, he probably was the worst one out of them. I like arrogant and prideful characters, but the dude was just a d!ck, and they didn&#039;t even bother to give him the slightest background or introduction they were just like &quot;Here! Just take this broken character that is horribly animated using CGI&quot;<br />
God how many times did i use &quot;character&quot; there ?  <br />
Still, the brainless 10 years old inside of me have been enjoying this show so far.<br />
Edit: yep i was right it went down hill, and im lowering the overall score to 4.

    THIS ANIME WAS PRETTY.... Fine... I guess?<br />
<br />
      Ok lets start off with Story. For this ill split this part into two the story building(+the first half) and the end(the second half).<br />
<br />
    The story building was pretty good as someone who likes to dream about living in immersive worlds I could enjoy the world the author originally made. I also really enjoyed the plot of both sides coming together to work and defeat Bal, the generic evil for fun character. I also really appreciated the story behind the Prince of Darkness in which he was born in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345174">
        small village which ended up being destroyed. I HOWEVER disliked the story of Iris. They didnt go much on her background and I disliked that. <br />
<br />
     Next the end. it was just bad. like really bad. The author or the creator of the anime just rushed it and it ruined it. Id like to not however the end is not the end since it seems like a season 2 will occur with the last blooper. I went and searched further and it seems like the anime may have been based of the game &quot;Shinriko Project&quot; or &quot;White Cat Project&quot;.<br />
<br />
     Next the art. The expressions the landscape and the people in general were REALLY REALLY nice, HOWEVER THE SHADING WAS WEIRD. The animators would constantly shade incorrectly from where the light source would be and it constantly distracted me from the show. The fight scenes were also ok but lacked clarity causing it to be less of a stand point in the show. THIS IS WHY IM GIVING THE ART A 7.<br />
<br />
      Now the Sound design. It was Ok... Just really Ok I have nothing to say of it. I think their was some depth and that was good I hate it when anime&#039;s dont have depth in their sound. Im giving it a 6.<br />
<br />
       For the characters im not gonna say much. Its goods that it isn&#039;t light=good and dark=bad but the characters weren&#039;t noticeably amazing. I did like the fight of willpower Iris had in the show even though it could be worked on. Many of the interesting characters didn&#039;t really get enough screen time. I giving it a 3. I also really disliked the love dynamic<br />
<br />
       the enjoyment was a 5. I enjoyed the slow and steady parts of the show more than the other parts. For example if I were to choose a episode to be my favorite it would be episode 7. I did not like the ending at all and would ruin the show for me.<br />
<br />
       Overall the show was a 5.6 (I rounded to a 6) It was not that bad but it was not that good.

    9 episodes in and the show is just okay, not bad but not very good<br />
<br />
Story: 5 <br />
The story is kinda meh, just a war between opposite sides plot<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
Seems alright enough<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
There is only one character I can think of that has bad voice acting and that&#039;s the monster dude from that one episode (forgot what episode he was in,  it was one of the early episodes), the opening is good <br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
The characters are boring and I just don&#039;t care much about them or what might happen in future episodes<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: ?<br />
<br />
Overall: 5 <br />
I guess I&#039;ll see where the story goes from here, though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342089">
        I don&#039;t know I&#039;m continuing to watch it. Overall, it is an alright show, not great but not terrible either. It wouldn&#039;t be too much of a waste of time to watch (though some of the episodes can be a little hit or miss)

    Right. I&#039;m going to try and keep this short and sweet. This show and or presumably the manga, (If there is one, I haven&#039;t bothered to waste my time checking), is so infuriatingly boring. They had something that could have been so much more, a story about an underdog rising up who&#039;s people are seen as the villains of the world. Instead we get a cookie cutter bullshit Romeo and Juliet story with boring and or obnoxiously intolerable characters. <br />
<br />
Not only did I have very little interested in this show, all of the interested and any hope of this show being decent that I may

    Black and white, is this called a chessboard?<br />
<br />
The beginning of the story begins when a village is attacked by monsters, which eventually kill everyone there.  Then there was a young man who managed to escape from the monster&#039;s attack.  The young man meets the Dark King as he buries all the villagers killed by the monster.  After the conversation with the Dark King he was near death, finally the young man inherited a sword belonging to the Dark King who made him the successor of the Prince of Darkness. On the other, Princess of Light, Iris is fighting the Dark Army in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345791">
        the sky there.<br />
<br />
I think this is a complicated and difficult story to understand.  Not that I didn&#039;t pay attention to this show but it was indeed complicated.  If you want to watch, I suggest you have some free time because watching this show requires a lot of time, which means it&#039;s no wonder that you often repeat their conversation.<br />
<br />
The opening of this anime is very good, the opening song is sung by ASCA and Takanori Nishikawa, entitled Tenbin Libra.  When I listen to it, this song has a strong vibe. The visual and audio aspects do not disappoint for an opening anime and the song is able to arouse the audience&#039;s enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
The story in the Shironeko Project anime is quite heavy to understand, but can still be enjoyed.  Usually fantasy genre stories are based on elements of the world building so that we as viewers at least understand what is happening in the protagonist&#039;s world.  At Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle we can see the story from 2 different points of view, from the Dark Prince and Princess of Light.  Interesting, because we can see what the Dark Lord feels, but not with the Princess of Light.<br />
<br />
Visually, the animation is fairly stable to enjoy.  Beautiful and attractive character designs are also the reason why this anime must be watched.  Seeing the behavior of Princess of light and Groza in the Shironeko Project anime is enough to calm the hearts of the audience.  One reason that makes this anime must be watched to the end is how the Dark prince and Princess of Light will meet.

    Note: I watched this with no previous knowledge of the game that it is adapted from, only knew its adapted from a game. I am also judging this show as a 12 episode anime -- this means keeping in mind what 12 episodes can accomplish, and not expecting the depth, character development, writing and literary techniques that can be employed with 24 episode, or, what some people have shown to do, expect the standards of a 50 episode piece in 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
It&#039;s nothing special. It isn&#039;t horrific, I&#039;ve seen anime where the art was just bad. It isn&#039;t a masterpiece for its time, its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345573">
        just ok. The cast could have been color themed better.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10 <br />
TM Revolution/Takanori Nishikawa helping with the OP theme is nice and all, but there isn&#039;t really any pieces from this show that I would really miss. It&#039;s on the good side just because of a few good fitting pieces music scores at the end really fit the scene they were with. <br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
The biggest downside of this show is that it is full of cliches. 12 episodes gives very little time to explore or grow characters. I&#039;ve seen other 12 or 24 episode anime try to do it, and sadly it just looks half-assed when you try to squeeze in character development that needs more time to do than what the show has to draw on (I know someone will misinterpret this sentence so for clarity, I&#039;ll note that there are 12-24 episode anime that do it well too!). On this note, I&#039;m glad this show didn&#039;t try too hard at character depth. Most of them won&#039;t be memorable for the next decades, but the characters played their role well. Obviously this won&#039;t propel a show&#039;s character writing to god tier levels, but I find this better than trying and ending up with a literary spilled trash can.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Again, this show&#039;s biggest downfall is the cliches. And again, that&#039;s ok, especially since it&#039;s literally a 12 episode gig, meant to be short and sweet, and in this case act as a promo for the bigger franchise (games). The reason I gave this an 8 is because it did its tropes well, no matter how common or well known (cliche) the trope is. What makes a story enjoyable is not how novel it is; this can be good but only if done right. This show&#039;s story is pretty much a budget Romeo and Juliet -- and THAT&#039;S ALRIGHT! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment --<br />
So did I enjoy these 12 episodes? Sure. This isn&#039;t meant to be the next Code Geass, this isn&#039;t meant to be the Greek tragedy that was Fate/Zero. Heck, this show was created for the purpose of promoting some games and giving the existing fanbase of the games  some fanservice. Did they keep this simple? Yes. Did they get me, someone completely new to the franchise, interested in checking out the games? Yes. My overall rating? 8/10. It did it&#039;s designated job well.<br />
<br />
Who this is for:<br />
-people who don&#039;t have a lot of time and just want to watch something longer than a standard movie, but not a full blown 24+ episode thing<br />
-romance genre fans<br />
-star-crossed lovers fans<br />
-fantasy fans<br />
<br />
Who this is not for: <br />
-people looking for the plot twists and inter-trope weaving that was Code Geass in 12 episodes<br />
-people looking for the ideological/philosophical deconstruction that made Fate/Zero and Psycho-Pass good in 12 episodes<br />
-people who only enjoy serious works aimed at being an intellectual discussion<br />
-people looking for a shounen adventure story, of which this is not

    I don&#039;t understand all the hate. it had real potential................til the ending.<br />
<br />
WARNING: Small spoilers included for the ending of show and for ending of kong vs godzilla.<br />
<br />
which is literally one of the worst endings I ever seen. A nobody wins, everyone loses ending. hell even the new Kong vs Godzilla movie ending was better, atleast there was a clear victor if it wasn&#039;t for Robozilla interfering and then they all of sudden become buddy buddy. Literally no winner when the entire damn show was around a war.<br />
<br />
<br />
so in the end if you don&#039;t mind disappointing endings, its a decent show.........til he end................... then its just

    This was the WORST anime i have ever seen, i can’t comprehend what the hell they were thinking when they made this. And the ending, THAT was the kicker, worst and most pointless 12 episodes to ever exist. If you’re thinkIn about watching it, prepare to be disappointed. I LITERALLY MADE AND ACCOUNT ON THIS SITE JUST SO I COULD ROAST THIS ANIME, IT WAS THAT BAD LIKE COME ON WTF. IVE NEVER DONE THIS TO ANY OTHER ANIME AND I PROBABLY WON’T DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE NOT MUCH COULD TOP THIS CRAP STAIN OF A SHOW. OH MY GOD!!!

    [Spoiler alert though as few as possible]<br />
<br />
Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle (2020)<br />
<br />
A show that feels like something of a cross between Romeo &amp; Juliet and Atlantis. By this, I mean a loving couple from two different worlds of society and a civilisation that has more than everyone else that falls to the ruins of its power. <br />
<br />
The synopsis for this programme is something very inaccurate. This is because it would appear to be the description for the setting of the game as opposed to this. If anything it is the after credit scene that is that synopsis specifically. The show itself seems to be predating that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345111">
        and makes this more of a 12 episode prequel/prologue for the game. <br />
That is itself is not a bad thing, but what is bad is the story feels lifeless as it is not structured great. We go from darkness to happiness, to sorrow and finish with a screw it all ending that then arrives at the games start. <br />
<br />
The art of the show is an OK standard. It is average when it should be great and awful when it should be average. Some scenes, especially in the finale, look like someone ripping paper as opposed to anything dramatic. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED are both pretty nice. Generally, sounds are cheaped out on and are a bit gutless which is surprising for something advertising a game regardless of platform. <br />
<br />
Characters we have our darkness as Romeo and Light as Juliet. Of course, that is my take on this. We do have many characters included that get some pretty slap-dash development which is disappointing. <br />
Groza is the only girl really who is true to herself and makes for a great character. She is bought down by her not being the chosen one. <br />
The Prince of Darkness is so gutless as a character and I mean lacking anything as a character that he is totally forgettable. When he does do something it just feels too late. <br />
Iris should be a great girl but her finale shows a gutless response to her situation. She broke a promise so quickly it was hardly worth making. Things could have gone so much better if it wasn&#039;t being made for the game. I would say it makes me not want to play it because of how Iris handled the situation. <br />
The other characters like Sheama are nice but ultimately bring very little. How quickly people abanded each other is ridiculous.  <br />
<br />
I would say this could have been great if it had been stand-alone away from its game. But because it is so linked it ruined itself. The finale for me alone bought me from an 8 to a 4 then I took into account the rest of the show and came to a 5. <br />
<br />
Not the worst watch out there but don&#039;t expect to be satisfied. <br />
<br />
5/10

    This piece of shit show wasn&#039;t even enjhoyable drunk. I&#039;m still drunk writing this review and can barely operate a keyboard since I can&#039;t see so forgive the speling and grammer mistakes. This show was absoultely terrible. I couldn&#039;t pay any attention to it since it was just boring and unenojoyable. The characters suck and there&#039;s no development whatsoever character, plot, world, it doesn&#039;t matter there is no development. There&#039;s two kingdoms that hate each other but work together for some reason. The kingdoms try to work together but don&#039;t do it very well since they kind of hate each other. Please just watch som,ething

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416233">
        like azumanga diaoh or anything else enjoyable whatsoever instead of this absoulte piece of shit show since this is the most boring. generic, poorly animated, bad, show that I have ever seen. I honestly enjoyed In another world with my smartphone since it was just really stupid and enjoyable while drunk, but even while inebriated, this show sucked pee pee. I couldn&#039;t make it past like 5 minutes into episode 7 sincew it just wasn&#039;t entertaining so I&#039;m switching to watching Azumanga and playing like dark souls or something. Don&#039;t watch this show even while drunk.

    This anime really tested my patience. The pacing and even genre of the whole show is up in the air for every episode. Starting off with an episode that sets up the main character in a brutal world of monsters and survival of the fittest. A couple of episodes in we are treated to slice of life cooking and joking around in the forest.<br />
<br />
Honestly it just feels so disjointed, and characters that act idiotic or does things that their character has not built up to just ruins the series for me. The main character, if you can call him that since he&#039;s on screen less

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373424">
        than most of the side characters, is so apathetic that there is no way for anyone to identify or relate to him. Smiling from time to time and reflecting over the status quo is not character building. <br />
<br />
If you value your time at all, stay well clear of this mess of an anime.

    What we have here is a anime adaptation of a android game.... Now then at that point you would think &quot; WOW a anime based off a mobile game? That&#039;s pretty epic! &quot; Then again if anyone remembers Final Fantasy: Advent Children, then you&#039;ll realize anything getting an adaptation of some sort will most likely fail, as the Final Fantasy series is Legendary, but Advent Children the Movie was god awful. That&#039;s just an example as to why NOT everything needs an adaptation of some sort. Now then on to the review, shall we? <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: The story is possibly the most generic thing I&#039;ve seen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369959">
        since the formulas of Shounen and Isekai anime, legit this anime has no originality whatsoever. Two kingdoms at war, Light vs Dark, and The whole &quot; Romeo-Juliet &quot; copy/paste romance, and The god awful main character himself is boring. His personality is dull to the point where it&#039;s like watching paint dry or Shading out wall paper. It doesn&#039;t get anymore generic than this!<br />
<br />
Art: The art style is mediocre to the point where you can clearly see the CGI in some parts of the anime and The looping of animation within the fight scenes is just way too much. Take out the crappy CGI and The looping of animations and The anime would at least have a good art style, but Nope. They went for mediocre.<br />
<br />
Sound: Here we have another anime where the Intro/Outro themes are amazing, but The anime itself sucks. Tenbin Libra by Takahiro Nishikawa x ASCA is the Intro theme and I really do enjoy it. I tend to enjoy J-Rock as well as J-Metal, you seriously can&#039;t go wrong with the intro theme song. Through The Dark by Rei Yasuda would be the outro theme and It&#039;s beautiful. I swear I love the themes to this anime, but The anime is just awful. <br />
<br />
Character Development: What character development? My oatmeal has more development compared to the characters within this anime. I disliked the generic romance between the two main characters and Most of all the personality for this character was three shades of wallpaper boring, couldn&#039;t they have done a better job? Especially for a mobile game adaptation???<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: I fell asleep watching this and Dropped it on the fourth episode. I gave Boruto four episodes and I also dropped that anime, basically I hated this anime just as much as Boruto and That&#039;s pretty sad given the fact that Boruto is bad, but Shironeko Project is much much worse compared to Boruto.<br />
<br />
Overall: Don&#039;t watch this anime, this Mobile game adaptation was most likely made in order to milk the anime business and Put more funds into the game itself. I don&#039;t recommend watching this, unless you like Generic anime plot and Boring character development. This anime is bad and It deserves to feel bad. <br />
<br />
Final Verdict: 2/10 This Anime is Dreadful, No reason to watch it. Trust me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoyed my reviews and I will review more anime further in the future

    It could of been so much better had it not been so rushed. There was no time shown to prove any bond between the prince and queen. He only ever fought once in the whole series basically. <br />
If this had had 24 episodes and they showed more character development it could have made a decent anime. Sad to say i wasted my time.<br />
The ending was confusing as hell, did the queen die?? did the prince die?? what happened to their friends??<br />
Also the main character never had a name at all during the series<br />
Havent seen such a rushed anime in a while.<br />
<br />
There should of been more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354467">
        development on, his Power itself, his friends, his time with the queen, his time with his instructor (who should of played a bigger part), the man who gave the main character his sword (never saw the battle between him and the king) and they should of shown more reason to the plot. <br />
Too many things didnt add up and was dissapointing because as overused this type of plot it i feel like it could of been better<br />
<br />
I honestly thought that perhaps he was from the floating islands but for some unknown reason was raised in the darklands. Since he had the power of light, even adding this to the anime would of made it worth while.
