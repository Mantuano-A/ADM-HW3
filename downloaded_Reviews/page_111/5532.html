    Alright, I’ll be real here. I owe an apology and a warning beforehand to everyone who did enjoy this show, but in the end, this is simply my honest opinion about a show I invested a bit too much hope and expectations in when it first aired back in May 2017.<br />
<br />
As someone who has followed the Yugioh franchise ever since I was in middle school, I can honestly say, without a shred of reconsideration, that this Yugioh installment was perhaps the most disappointing, if not the worst, installment out of all the anime series up to date, and probably one of the most underwhelming anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318236">
        series in general that I watched up to date.<br />
<br />
(P.S. THERE WILL BE A FEW SPOILERS.)<br />
<br />
So exactly what is this show? Well, Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS, or simply known as VRAINS, is the fifth spin-off series of the Yugioh franchise, and actually the ninth overall. It was made as a means to introduce, familiarize, and promote the then-new Link Summoning format to the countless anime followers. Initially directed by Masahiro Hosoda for the first 13 episodes, the director role was abruptly switched to Katsuya Ayano for episode 14 and onward. It is animated by Studio Gallop, whom are well known for their role in nearly all the other Yugioh series, and directed Shin Yoshida, another all-too-familiar face in this trading card game franchise.<br />
<br />
The anime series takes place in an alternate timeline/universe in an urban setting called Den City, where virtual reality space, under the official name of LINK VRAINS, is a commodity and normality for the people. In this VR space, users can customize their avatars and participate in Duels against each other, so from the get-go, the show is basically the Sword Art Online version of Duel Monsters. The story follows a young man named Yusaku Fujiki, who goes under the alias and avatar of “Playmaker” and gets involved in the underlying conflict and revelations of LINK VRAINS, and in the process, meets and teams up with an extremely peculiar self-aware artificial intelligence program, whom he then calls Ai. The show’s theme is to “Take a step forward, and try!”, on the assertion that kids should try things out instead of just giving up easily after the first try due to feeling overwhelmed by the challenge ahead.<br />
<br />
STORY: 3/10<br />
This’ll be rather long. However, considering the sudden change of directors early on in the show, I should’ve known where this story’s direction was headed right then and there. Even the apparent supervising of Katsuya’s directing by Tatsuo Satou, who’s directed shows like Martian Successor Nadesico and Lord of Vanadis, wasn’t enough, apparently.<br />
The initial premises of VRAINS are pretty much fairly similar to the likes of the aforementioned Sword Art Online series (though more so the Alicization arcs) and other virtual reality MMO shows like the Hack series, Accel World, and King’s Avatar. The aforementioned shows have a collective focus on both the virtual and real world, drawing the link between the two realities. The settings initially get interesting as the show goes along with all the revelations regarding the underlying forces and events going on that was supposed to ultimately add more structure to the story. However, as the series progresses, the show proceeds to ignore certain aspects of the story that should’ve been made more relevant.<br />
For example, Dueling in LINK VRAINS has two options: Speed Dueling or Master Dueling, and being similar to the Action Duels in Yugioh Arc-V, Dueling in LINK VRAINS is supposed to bring the high risk of physical and/or psychological harm to individuals, which doesn’t exclude the possibility of death. That aspect is quite similar to the dangers during the Aincrad and Alicization arcs of Sword Art Online, though to a rather limited extent. Because of this, nearly every single Duel featured in the show should feel like actual high stakes being made; however, there was little consequence from this important plot element, as the show pretty much drags and brings most of the attention to the main conflict of each arcs. As a result, the feeling of high stakes from just Dueling in VR, even on Speed Duels where the players are literally surfboarding on “data currents” tens of meters high above the ground, just came off as nonprevalent, and any brushes with danger don’t actually result in severe or long-lasting consequences, anyways.<br />
VRAINS also seems to be on one hell of a short end in terms of worldbuilding. While Yugioh shows aren’t exactly the best in worldbuilding compared to most other popular anime franchises, VRAINS seems to try way too hard in terms of trying to establish and explain its settings, as opposed to naturally letting the worldbuilding conduct itself with the story narrative. Instead of utilizing the freedom to dive further into other notable plot elements that would help give a better siegeway from Point A to Point B, VRAINS devotes nearly all the focus on the current conflict at hand, only briefly mentioning major key terms here and there. There is no further diving into how and why LINK VRAINS was made. There’s not enough explained context on the hi-tech aspects of the world. There is no in-depth exploration and explanation on other terms and plot elements like Data Storm, Storm Access, Link Sense, The Deleted, and the company SOL Technologies as well as the androids produced by them. We end up being left asking and resorting to assumptions a lot more often than not, which is not really a good thing most of the time.<br />
The lack of explanations, as well as the questionable writing of the characters, makes the storytelling feels quite soulless and rather pretentious, as with each arc, it tries too hard to set up the conflict without properly building it up or fleshing out other important plot elements more. The separate arcs themselves are rather rinse-and-repeat, where it always just ends up with the main protagonist having to deal with the main threat himself while tossing practically every other character to the sidelines. While the setups in Yugioh 5Ds and VRAINS are not that much different (considering Shin Yoshida being responsible for the series composition of both shows), the former functions extremely well because it was able to establish other aspects and characters in the shows that are not immediately tied to the main conflict at hand, thus allowing for a far superior buildup. VRAINS does not really give itself such a padding because the roles of characters not named Yusaku / Playmaker are part of some self-contained subplots that actually don’t contribute anything beyond an overly sappy backstory and a halfhearted reason to be involved in the main plot in the first place.<br />
Two additional things I should add. First off, the story also seems to feel extremely dragged out due to how it handles the action and dialogue. Like seriously, there is SO MUCH tedious dialogue and exposition in the middle of nearly all the Duels. Turns can feel like they last forever, and dialogue and attempts at emotional impact get rather pretentious like it’s some soap arena. Why must a show from a franchise I really loved...become a soap opera and somehow feel boring, broken, and dragged out all at the same time? Second and lastly, the lighthearted comedy misses A LOT. It felts half-hearted, awkward, and out-of-place. The characters initiating the humor feel like they’re trying way too hard to be funny and be a running gag. While I’m kinda forced to get used to Ai’s cases, other characters like the derp-ass Banjo Kazooie pair (okay, it’s just two people whose avatars are a frigging frog and a pigeon...lul) and Naoki are practically insufferable.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION AND SOUND: 5/10 and 4/10<br />
There’s nothing particularly special about the animation and soundtracks overall, but not necessarily bad, either. The 3D designs for the Monsters are quite alright, and the new Summon animation designs for Synchro and Xyz Summoning are pretty cool. The 2D animation can range from adequate to subpar depending on the episode, as each one is usually animated by a different individual or group. The characters designs are average and there’s not much to really divulge into beyond the typical Yugioh character design tropes (aka funky-ass hairdos).<br />
The soundtracks in this show feel like they’re trying way too hard to be grandiose overall. This is likely due to the entire story itself being rather underwhelming in terms of the showcasing. As a result, you get this out-of-place trumpet-filled instrumentals in otherwise very underwhelming scenes. Like honestly, the OST from the Hack series would’ve better fit this show in all honesty. The lone great soundtrack was Yusaku’s theme, as it does come in timely fashion during the more climactic parts of the show. Otherwise, it’s only really good by itself. The voice acting is rather subpar, as it feels like the characters are trying too hard to be sound serious most of the time. There is no strong sense of flexibility and variety in the voices to where it would feel more natural as the characters interact with one another or express emotions during the melodrama parts. As a result, the sound aesthetics feel very disjointed.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 2/10<br />
I can’t really call these guys characters. They’re more like husks. There was so much groundwork in their backstories and ongoing subplots to where the cast members could’ve turned out as great characters. However, the development feels extremely hollow and not genuine, and ends up tossed to the side, anyways, as the characters other than Yusaku and Ai get tossed aside like fodder. What’s really sad is that every following arc tries to build back up these characters, but it ends up forced, contrived, pretentious, and unnatural. They might as well be just robots, as their composition ends up extremely dry and half-baked. I’m pretty sure the story would’ve went on fine without introducing them in the first place.<br />
Yusaku as a character is extremely bland and tasteless. He is basically an epitome of a Gary Stu protagonist. He has not been put in a position of genuine struggle or hardship. He doesn’t really have any case of natural character development. His so-called ties with the other characters don’t even qualify as “bonds and friendship”. His initial goal for revenge becomes non-relevant in the end. The only thing he’s good at is sounding “cool” while Dueling.<br />
Revolver, the main rival, could’ve potentially been one of the better ygo main rivals if he had more prominent roles in the following story arcs after the first one with the Hanoi Project. There isn’t even a good old final duel between him and Mister Gary Stu MC. Ai, being the secondary protagonist, didn’t have a particularly interesting role other than being that wisecracking jerk of a partner for Yusaku, so when his role switches to an antagonistic one near the end, it felt extremely disjointed, as the setup for it was not a very well drawn-out one.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 2/10<br />
Being a rather devoted Yugioh fan, I can understand the production value issues the show encountered throughout its entire airing duration, to where it had around four recap episodes early on (hence why I temporarily called it V-RECAPS at one point). However, due to the overall showcasing I got, I can’t exactly overlook how much it affected the series, and at the same time, it doesn’t give me enough reason to have the benefit of the doubt. I got bored by most of the duels, with the exception of the most climactic moments during the final “boss battles”. Even then, such moments are rather temporary and do not really quell out my overall boredom. I genuinely did try to find enough interest in the plot to at least if there would be any sort of good payoff in terms of story, cause I was starting to give up on the characters’ development halfway through the show. At best, the show is more like a low-value time-killer when I don’t have much else to do and watch at that moment in the day. Trying to get hyped for every episode like I did back when I watched the likes of 5Ds and Arc-V was out of the question, due to practically all the other aforementioned reasons.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 2.5/10<br />
VRAINS tried to be something amazing, it tried to be mature, it tried to be unique from the other spinoffs, but it just didn’t have the adequate content, depth, storywriting, and characters to even make it halfway there. Even if you’re a Yugioh fan, I honestly cannot recommend this show, and even FAR less so if you’re not even a fan of the entire franchise in general. If anything, you’re better off watching the original DM series (NOT the season 0 series, screw that one), 5Ds, and Arc V...heck, even Zexal, with all its issues, was still far more entertaining and sophisticated in terms of story and characters. VRAINS is a prime example of absolutely wasted potential, and an extremely mediocre show that otherwise gets excessively high praise by its fanbases. Again, I really apologize if I offended anyone who did love the show, cause honestly, I wanted to love this show, too. But in the end, the numerous shortcomings and flaws did in this farce of a series, and I was left with nothing except to reminisce what could’ve been.

    First impression of the VRAINS series is that the anime has a more mature theme much like the 5D&#039;s series, which in my opinion is a plus. So far the story is about the high school student Yuusaku who secretly works as a hacker fighting against the criminal hacking organisation &quot;Knights of Hanoi&quot; due to a yet unexplained background that involved these two. Duels are now carried out in a futuristic VR system called the VRAINS that allows players to manifest as an avatar inside the cyber realm.<br />
<br />
The story so far is very well-paced and enjoyable - all the duels have had meaningful for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254051">
        story and all of them have been very exciting precisely for that very reason. I also think the show&#039;s brilliance lie in the very well-done introduction of the characters. The protagonist is very likeable character who is cool and serious but at the same time not emotionless and able to show his enjoyment in dueling (much like Yusei from 5D&#039;s). The rivals have all got a few episodes of introduction which covers why they are the way they are and what reason they have to duel and be part of the VRAINS community. And finally, the villains have been excellently antagonised early in the series by first hinting that they have a valid humane reason for their criminal activities, and then dissipating our sympathy by showing just how ruthless and inhumane they are in achieving their goals.<br />
<br />
In the animation department, needless to say that since it&#039;s a Yu-Gi-Oh series, you can expect top-notch battle scenes that can probably be considered as another upgrade from the past series. As another plus, the music is also amazing (and I think the general concensus would agree with me on this one) that I don&#039;t actually skip both the opening and ending song in each episode, which is a pretty rare case for me.<br />
<br />
TL:DR The show so far has been great - the story is very enjoyable and well-paced, and the characters are well-introduced and very relatable to the audience. Animation and duel scenes are amazing as usual, and the music choice is also one of my personal favourite this season. As a Yu-Gi-Oh fan I&#039;m immensely enjoying the anime so far, as it seems to be another step-up from the past series.

    You know folks. There&#039;s some animes where you pick them up and try to watch them then you start to question why you even bother doing anime reviews in the first place because an anime like Yugioh Vrains comes along and I got to be perfectly honest with you. I have no idea who this anime was actually made for because I thought this was made for me because I liked 5Ds with its realistic written characters and gritty setting but Yrains is not that at all that, I also thought that Yugioh Vrains was made for people who like tightener plot and characters but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318281">
        once again Yugioh Vrains isn&#039;t that. Finally, I thought Yugioh Vrains was made for people who loved MNORPG games but once again Yugioh Vrains isn&#039;t that.<br />
<br />
Even though the series has quote &#039;&#039;sightly has improved towards the end.&#039;&#039; with its somewhat interesting third season but when I got to a point I stop caring because by then I wanted this show to end or to a very least get cancelled due to executive meddling or poor ratings in Japan. To be perfectly honest with you. When I watched this anime. When I commuted 2880 minutes of my life to this show the only thing I could think while watching it while experiencing what the anime had to offer from start to finish it only took me about 6 episodes to come to this conclusion.<br />
<br />
This is quite simply the most soulless tedious, broken and uninspired anime I have ever watched in my entire life.<br />
<br />
I am not exaggerating when I say that I have more fun watching Darling in the Franxx, Fire Force and Wise Man Grandchild than this because to know what I can work with bad anime because with bad anime I can find some things that I can laugh about or I can see where the anime went wrong and I can point out aspects that could have improved upon but what I cannot work with is something that is soul-crushing boring and tedious and Yugioh Vrains is the embodiment of that.<br />
<br />
First and foremost I loathe the writing in Yugioh Vrains.<br />
<br />
Not only it was horribly written to the core but it&#039;s embarrassingly cliche. The sci-fi elements in Vrains is what happens when you take the most generic and stock sci-fi story imaginable and shove it in without any context. It was painful to watch and it constantly made me facepalm and roll my eyes out of embarrassment. The same thing can be said for the duels which were predictable as hell especially with that annoying link spam that is on par with Yuya action card asspulls from Arc V in terms of annoyance.<br />
<br />
This is only made worse by how pathetic the world-building is if you can call it that. The series is set in a virtual reality space known as Link Vrains, where duelist from all over the world can duel each other for fun or competitive.<br />
<br />
If that&#039;s the case so why does Link Vrains feel so empty and lifeless. There&#039;s barely anyone interacts with the world of Link Vrains and the VRMMORPG aspects more often than not feel like a hamfisted plot device for the show soulless writing. In many ways Link Vrains is no different from the virtual reality worlds of Sword Art Online as both worlds were heavily unexplored, and they often used as plot device. There&#039;s no casual to competitive weekly tournaments for players to participate to win prices, no adventure quests, no online store nothing. What kind of competitive VRMMORPG game is this?<br />
<br />
The one thing that really infuriated me about Vrains is how it tried to be more epic and deep than it actually is. Compared to any other Yugioh installments Yugioh Vrains is story focused which was great on paper but it all comes crashing down thanks to abysmal writing which I already mentioned as well lack of self-awareness that exposes its pretentious nature, I honestly hate using the word pretentious when I review an anime that has an inept story but Vrains is a special exception. Vrains tries to tackle serious topics and themes of abuse, virtual reality, loneliness yet not only they were executed badly but the series at many cases shouts out how mature and smart it is when it actually not. Just because you threw away many story elements in the franchise such as a laid back tournament arc in favour of mature sci-fi/virtual reality elements doesn&#039;t automatically make you series mature. You have to prove yourself that these new story elements are well written enough to justify of removing key aspects that the franchise is known for. Vrains doesn&#039;t do any of that and your left with an insufferable pretentious sci-fi series that barely resembles Yugioh at all. Now I mentioned it Yugioh Vrain doesn&#039;t feel like a Yugioh show at all as it feels like I&#039;m watching a awful sci-fi series that has been rejected by various Japanese TV producers and I believe that the only reason the badly written script even saw the light of day because they had to slap in a well-known franchise in to the mix that being Yugioh. You can tell that from the very first episode that the tone, pacing, character establishment and dialogue were off even for Yugioh standards.<br />
You could say the same thing for 5Ds but it proved itself that even with its mature approach was still a Yugioh show. Vrains feels like an unneeded gimmick just like the link format itself. I can write an essay of how it four of it&#039;s summon methods being Fusion, Synchros, XYZs and Pendulums were shut down thanks to the forced link mechanics that effectively killed a big wave of decks and archetypes but I won&#039;t do it here because this review will end up being over 3000 words long.<br />
<br />
The kicker of Yugioh Vrains is the atrocious pacing. If you thought Black Clover, Naruto, Tokyo Ghoul re, Index Season 3 and Darling in the Franxx were atrocious in pacing you have not seen an episode of Vrains. I am not exaggerating when say I this but Yugioh Vrains has the absolute worst pacing I have ever seen in my life. It&#039;s so padded, so rushed especially for seasons 2 and 3 I cannot help to notice that the series was going through serious production issues which it actually did because the people who worked on Vrains actually talked about the numerous production issues to the public. I will give the Vrain&#039;s staff credit for addressing the production issues to the public on social media but I wish the Vrains staff had handled its plot, charterers and visuals better because they were garbage.<br />
<br />
Season 3 is not much better either.<br />
<br />
I will give the season some credit for having a interesting final villain and the somewhat decent ending that managed to better than Arc V ending but unfortunately the damage from the poorly constructed first 2 seasons has already been done.<br />
<br />
Now we have the characters who are somehow even worse than the lifeless plot.<br />
<br />
Yusaku is the main protagonist of the series and my main problem with him is that he is a Gary sue brick. He has zero personality just as he barely has any facial expressions other than a straight face. He also has little to no character development as by the time you get to season 3 he&#039;s still the same brick character from episode 1. Let&#039;s not forget he is a complete dick to he&#039;s friends as well the fact he&#039;s an overpowered duelist who never loses. One of the main reasons why I liked Yusei a character from 5Ds is that the cool and relatable character. Sure he never lost a duel in the anime, but he&#039;s character chemistry towards the cast as well he&#039;s well-written backstory and collective personality completely make up. Yusei is a character. Yusaku is an emotionless sack of shit husk who has no friends, no personality and no ideals. That is why he is the worst protagonist I have ever encountered in an anime.<br />
<br />
When I was binge watching Yugioh Vrains with a friend he mentioned that the supporting characters are nothing more than soulless archetypes, and he couldn&#039;t be more right. The supporting characters like with Yusaku don&#039;t develop at all and unlike the protagonist they are utterly useless with a few exceptions like Ai and Revolver.<br />
<br />
The Yugioh franchise has always lived with diverse and colorful cast of characters. There&#039;s a reason why both anime and yugioh fans grow to love characters like Yugi, Kaiba Ryo, Joey, Zane, Aster, Jaden, Akiza, Sheery, Jack, Leo, Kaito, Anna, Ryouga, Rei, Shun, Yuto, Sora, Dennis Serena etc.. They have personality and are interesting to watch, regardless of if they&#039;re playing card games or not. Characters from previous Yugioh series all have good to great character chemistry with each other due to amazing character interactions that play each other well E.g Sora and Shun, Sora and Yuya, Zane and Aster, Jack and Yusei, Jack and Carly, Jaden and Chazz. Rei/Vector and Yuma.<br />
<br />
Yugioh Vrains doesn&#039;t do any of that as every single character apart from Revolver and Ai are lifeless husks that barely do anything worthwhile other to be plot devices and cannon fodder. How pathetic.<br />
<br />
Now I mentioned before the visuals in this show were garbage, and I still stand by that. I can forgive the inconsistent character designs, the choppy animation, the crappy CGI and the messy shot composition since this is a long-running series and long-running series tend to have lower budget compare to seasonal anime but I cannot forgive is the consistent still frames, camera shake and motion filer that were heavily abused throughout the 120 episode run. It just makes an already poorly constructed series even more painful to watch.<br />
<br />
The music is nothing to write home about. The soundtrack features a generic score of sci-fi, electronic and forte tracks that while fit the anime is not all that memorable.<br />
<br />
The opening themes are fine, the ending themes are fine, the voice acting are fine. Overall the sound aspect of Vrains is the most harmless thing about it.<br />
<br />
For the first time I will be suggesting improvements for series that I hate.<br />
<br />
I know that&#039;s a bizarre move on my part especially when I just tor this show apart but I believe that with the rights tools and staff. Yugioh Vrains could have been just as great if not better than 5Ds.<br />
<br />
First off give Yusaku a likeable personality. Until the end of the series Yusaku had little to personality as he was a Stoic guy just pulls a straight face. Not to mention he was a complete dick to everyone. I understand he was abused as a child, but he has no reason to take his frustration on others. My suggestion for Yusaku personality is to be cool and friendly individual who tries to move on with his past while occasionally having PTSD from his dark past that causes him to have a change of personality.<br />
<br />
Also, have him lose a duel please...<br />
<br />
Establish the world of Link Vrains. There should have been some downtime where the characters are just hanging exploring Link Vrains doing in-game activities It could help spice Yusaku characterization early on as he mostly Stoic. Even Gundam Build Divers did that and that show was more unfocused than Fallout 76.<br />
<br />
Have a tournament arc. Having an arc like that in the show could have not only brought the world of Link Vrains to life but it could have fleshed out it&#039;s supporting characters. This is something that Cardfight Vanguard and Future Card Buddyfight did as it made many of the supporting characters for those shows are just as memorable as the mains.<br />
<br />
Feature a child character like Leo (5Ds) or Sora (Arc V)that accompanies Yusaku on his adventures in Link Vrains. Having a kid character could have made the plot more interesting. It could have showcased the lighthearted side of Vrains with the added comedy. Finally, the kid charterer could have helped Yusaku come out of his shell as well paralleling Yusaku&#039;s old personality from childhood before the abduction that caused him to be an anti-social individual.<br />
<br />
So that was Yugioh Vrains. A broken, soulless, half fast, insufferable mess of a show that has some of the worst characters, production values and writing I have ever seen. It is a series that tries to be different compare to any other installment yet it lost its own Yugioh identity along the way it devolved into this boring and uninspired sci-fi series that barely resembles Yugioh at all. On top of all that there&#039;s no passion whatsoever. Everything that Yugioh Vrains did were done better in different anime. This is not only my least favourite Yugioh instalment but its also one of the worst animes I have seen in long while and that is sad because as much I hate to admit it Yugioh Vrains had the potential to be great. It had a lot of great ideas that could ‎have made Yugioh relevant again in the main stream side of anime but instead we get a broken, unpolished and soulless mess an anime that will be remembered for the wrong reasons.

    From a hardcore Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, this show was somewhat disappointing. After coming off of the roller coaster that was Zexal and Arc-V, I really wanted to like this show. I thought this was going to be the 5Ds of the second trilogy of Yu-Gi-Oh! shows. I liked Yusaku’s design and the show had decent aesthetics. There are so many things that hindered Vrains from being good. For one thing, the show suffered from shoddy production leading to an excessive amount of recaps. THE GOD DAM RECAPS!<br />
<br />
I’ll be delving into various plot points so spoilers below:<br />
<br />
But looking past that, season 1 was actually pretty good. We

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318237">
        got a nice introduction to our core characters of Yusaku, Aoi, and Go. Plus the knights of Hanoi were pretty menacing and Revolver was freaking badass. There was actually some tension in the show. This was definitely the strongest season and in my opinion the best one despite all the recaps.<br />
<br />
Then came the disaster that was season 2. We get introduced to Takeru Homura. Now I don’t hate Takeru, I just hate what they did with him. I know there was a change in director during this show so that may have played a role in this but I must say that the original vision of this show was not realized. This I can only theorize would be the trio from season 1 facing new threats as a team from the higher ups at Sol Tech. Instead they play second fiddle.<br />
<br />
Takeru is basically Yusaku 2.0. Just the mere presence of this character completely overshadows Aoi and Go who could have had way more development alongside Yusaku. Instead we just have this guy beating everyone around him and being a Mary Sue. Granted, he does receive quite a lot of character development and ends up being the MOST developed during the show. Sure he’s loud and kinda edgy but he’s okay. The problem is that the rest of the cast becomes irrelevant as if taking a back seat. They did some...interesting things with Go Onizuka. It was a twist to be sure but I feel as if it was a bit forced. I did like how he defeated Earth and basically killed him off but this whole plotpoint was just so out of character from the Go of season 1.<br />
<br />
Now onto the next problem with this season: Bowman. This man was just a walking disappointment. Sure he’s a good duelist but he’s boring. He dueled Yusaku 4 times in the show. Like what?? They could not think of anything else but to build up a rematch 3 times in a single season nor even have a tag duel with Yusaku and Revolver. They did nothing to spice things up and instead followed a bread and butter formula that was indeed predictable. The ones with plot armor were most certainly going to win.<br />
<br />
The only redeeming thing about this season were the ignis. If not for them, this would have been insufferable to watch. I love Windy and Lightning as villains, especially in the second half. There are some good duels here. Example: Windy vs Revolver; Soulburner vs Windy; Spectre vs Lightning. Aside from that, it’s pretty much just a spiel of Bowman duels which were not fun at all.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on about season 2 but let’s move on to season 3, which is one of the shortest seasons in Yu-Gi-Oh! history. I can’t really blame this season for anything. They probably knew they were going to get canceled and had to wrap it up fast but god dam was there just so much left in the air. This could have been the season that redeemed Vrains but instead it was a rushed hot mess. Personally, I love Ai as a villain. I think it’s a great twist and adds potential drama in the mix. Roboppy’s duel with Soulburner was a treat to see and it had some Arc-V vibes going on (if you know what I mean). Even Soulburner vs Revolver is pretty incredible serving as a closure for both of their characters. Yusaku vs Ai might be one of my favorite end of series duels in all of Yu-Gi-Oh. And that’s where the praising ends. The other characters barely got any screen time and other potential plot points got shafted. I wanted more from this season but sadly we won’t get any.<br />
<br />
By the end of this show, Yusaku is clearly the biggest Mary Sue in Yu-Gi-Oh! history with plot armor as large as the Pacific Ocean. He had all his development in season 1 and was never fleshed out again. The rest of the cast is just...dead. The show lost its flair after season 1 which is a huge disappointment. Vrains was no dark horse of the franchise. In fact, it was very close to a dumpster fire and I hate to say it because there were things I legitimately enjoyed and wanted to enjoy more of. I did like the way it ended though. I can only pray that Yu-Gi-Oh! 7 can make use of this 6 month development gap to make up for the disaster that was Vrains.

    I&#039;ve always been a big fan of the Yugioh series. Each iteration managed to improve upon its predecessors in some way or another, while still keeping things &quot;fresh&quot;. Yugioh 5D&#039;s pushed the envelope with its outrageous concept and it succeeded. Coupled with strong characters and a great storyline, 5D&#039;s is easily my favourite of the series. Comparing the later seasons to the earlier ones, it becomes clear that the newer yugioh anime take a similar route to a specific earlier part; especially in the tone, character designs as well as themes. Zexal has its roots in the original DM, ARC V in GX and this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318235">
        yugioh Vains in 5D&#039;s. I was taught not to judge a book by its cover, so I kept an open mind towards Vrains despite my high hopes. Whether people want to overlook it or not is up to the individual, but I believe it fails at many fundamentals for writing a good story. This review will go into details why I feel this way.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
First, let&#039;s get this out of the way: Episodes 13, 21, 29, 38, 59, 83 and 103 are recaps which only retell the old story without much new stuff. At most, it has one single new scene splashed at the end to seem not completely purposeless. These points are nothing you don&#039;t pick up later and I suggest to just skip these episodes completely. <br />
<br />
Now about the actual story: The series is based in a world of the near future where a massive Virtual Reality Network called LINK VRAINS has been established. By using LINK VRAINS, Duels unfold where Duelists change their appearance separate from their real life identities. However, in LINK VRAINS, a mysterious hacker group that hacks via Dueling has appeared: The Knights of Hanoi. Their goal is to destroy a specific Ai known as Cyberse that exists somewhere in the depths of the Network. There is one enemy who stands in their way, Playmaker. His true identity is ordinary high school student Yusaku Fujiki, who wants to find out the truth of an incident that happened in his past. <br />
<br />
Vrains plot is easily its biggest problem. It follows a straight line and doesn&#039;t take longer ways, even if it should. We go from 1 duel to the next, not showing the impact each individual conflict and event has. Because of that, it feels rushed more often than not and doesn&#039;t leave the characters nor the viewer any time to breath. On the other hand, at some points the show feels slow and dragging. The another arc or the first half of the lost memories arc could easily be reduced to half the episodes, but includes unneccessary duels and fanservice with almost no story. And the problem about no story shows itself in almost every big arc. It usually means 10-20 episodes of only duels with pretty much nothing but duels. The entertainment goes down to zero and stays there until something plot- or character related happens, which usually takes a lot of time. That quickly becomes very boring and at some points, watching the recaps instead feels like the right way just because it doesn&#039;t consume a lot of time. Unfortunately, the anime isn&#039;t able to ever recover from this issue and you can only hope it will ever have something to show besides the duels. Sadly, you lose interest before that moment comes. <br />
<br />
And now I got to address the ending arc of the show. Comparing different Yugioh Anime with one other is simply not fair, as it always prevents a neutral view on each individual installment; but there is a point to be made here. The 3 prior yugioh anime went from 146 – 154 episodes, which shows their similar planing and execution over all series. Yugioh Vrains drops in at only 120 episodes, already giving you an idea that something didn&#039;t go as planned. In fact, I&#039;d consider only the first 102 episodes to be the actual plot and the last 17 episodes to be the epilogue. That could have worked on its own, if they just wanted to complete the character arcs and give an actual ending to all the main and side characters. But unfortunately, it rather tried to put in an unnessessary longer plot into these episodes too, which prevented the writers from giving each character the respect and time he/she deserves. Some characters even got worse treatment than the first two seasons gave them, which is a shame since the anime certainly had the time to give everyone a satisfying conclusion. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The characters are the strong point of the show. I&#039;ll separate the main characters and lump together the not so main characters:<br />
Yusaku Fujiki/Playmaker: Yusaku is the Main Character of the anime and a hacker who fights against evil organizations in the Network alongside his Partner Ai. Being written in the typical &quot;OP Badass&quot; Archetype, he doesn&#039;t show emptions while being very powerful.  This Archetype needs 2 basic things to be able to work: The Character needs negatives, in some way or another, and needs to be an actual character with personality. The first point was made fair enough, with him being social unable to speak normal to others or form real bonds. What the writers forgot though is his personality. Most of the time, he is just a puppet like figure saying the obvious things without anything resembling a human being. It is good to make a character flawed, but leaving out a personality is inexcuseable. Adding to that his lack of development makes him one of the anime&#039;s worst characters, which is a shame since protagonists should be the driving force behind the show, not a continuous brake.<br />
Aoi Zaizen/Blue Angel: She is Yusaku&#039;s Classmate and an entertainment duelists in the VRAINS known as Blue Angel who gets caught up in the multi-sided war. Aoi is one of the anime&#039;s best characters, both in her personality and goals. In the real world, she is a quiet and shy girl with difficulties in private relationships. In the Network World however, she becomes an active, happy and free dueltainer who just does the things she wants to do. This duality is very important, as her differences between her real self and online avatar are drastic and undeniable. This makes her feel alive and relatable, as everyone on the internet nowadays has an avatar where everyone can be whoever everyone wants to be. Unfortunately, Vrains lacks this important theme for most of it&#039;s run, as every other character is the same in real life and in game. Her Goals are (without getting into too many spoilers) relatable and basic, making her again more human. They shift multiple times over the series, showing her development as a character and different views on the world around her. <br />
Ai/Dark Ignis: Being a member of the Cyberse, his life is sought after by the Knights of Hanoi. He is your expected partner, or more pet for most of Vrains run. He is often there when action takes place, but doesn&#039;t do anything besides looking. And the consequence is, that he feels uninteresting and unneccessary. He does have some important moments, but is mostly just doing things in the shadow, if at all. As the anime continues, he gets more development, a personality other than pure comedy and becomes more realistic and mature. By the end of the series, he is one of the best characters not just in Yugioh Vrains, but in the whole Franchise. It just takes a long time to get there.<br />
Ryoken Kogami/Revolver: He is the Leader of the Knights of Hanoi and wants to kill the Cyberse. Ryoken is the most developed character in the anime. His character is vastly different from the beginning and end of the show. Besides being gone for 10 – 20 episodes occasionally, he drives the plot forward and is the most active character. Unlike the others though, his character arc constantly develops with every duel he has, which makes him more interesting and deeper.<br />
Takeru Homura/Soulburner: Takeru is a friend and ally of Yusaku who appears first in the second season. He is a self confined and energic teenager who is trapped in his past and wants to be able to move forward. Therefore, he contacts yusaku and follows him to eventually find a way to let his past behind. Takeru is the most relatable and realistic character in the show. We get a lot of backstory and everyday life displayed, which lacks in many other aspects of the anime. His character arc is mostly the same as yusaku&#039;s first, but far better executed. The one problem is that he feels too much like a Playmaker 2.0, which lessens our interest and investment in him and feels unoriginal. Besides that, his writing is pretty much flawless. <br />
<br />
Villains: The Villains are the strongest points in the whole show. Especially the major antagonists of each season are relatable, well-developed and have a good motive for their action, Going deeper would be a spoiler, but they are certainly the highlight of the anime. Even though not all are great, most of them are.<br />
<br />
Other/Minor Characters: The other characters mostly do their job. Some are better than others, but none are very outstanding. They have unique arcs and expand the world building in individual ways. Vrains isn&#039;t able to let its characters drop, which later on leads to some duelists just hanging around in the story without any influence or point to it. Instead of writing them out of the story and giving them individual endings during the story, the team made them stay in the plot far longer than needed, which keeps the focus away from our protagonists, as we first have to somehow get these characters out of the picture to let the important characters duel.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The animation really isn&#039;t that breathtaking and only works most of the time. As a long-running anime, you can clearly see how they often had to re-use old animation and backgrounds. There was also the change in directors very early in the series, where there was supposed a huge improvement; apparently, animation wasn&#039;t one of them. It works most of the time, and sometimes they show where the budget went into: These moments are usually the summoning- and attack animations during the duels. The animation and Art is good when it counts, but isn&#039;t worth pointing out otherwise.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack:<br />
Just like the Art, the soundtrack isn&#039;t at all breathtaking and only works most of the time. Some of the music that was used was fitting for the themes and atmosphere of the anime, but it normally just appears without any other reason than a &quot;cool moment&quot; or &quot;amazing strategy&quot; being displayed in a duel. It is often enjoyable, but nothing more than that and adds nothing to the series other than having sound at all. And having the same music play over 100+ episodes becomes boring and repetitive either way.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
There isn&#039;t anything else to point out besides the good and bad points that were already mentioned. Vrains was often entertaining, but the huge problems just stuck out during most of it&#039;s run.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Yugioh Vrains has a few good points, but fails at many basics in story development and character building. My recommendation: If you are already a fan of the other yugioh anime or are interested for any other reason, you might want to check it out and decide to stop or continue after 20 episodes. <br />

    *THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS SO BE CAREFUL.. BUT I WILL MINIMISE IT.. *<br />
<br />
Spring 2017 season is already over. With the return of the phenomenal Attack On Titan, to the so called &#039;&#039;Trash&#039;&#039; anime Eromanga-sensei, the animes last spring season was quite alright with the shows it offers to us.. But I was not expecting of a return of one of the most famous childhood animes we&#039;ve been watched, though on this date, almost no one doesn&#039;t remember or even care about this collection of animes. That&#039;s right. The YuGiOh! franchise... As a fan of the franchise (I still am), Ive watched almost all of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258123">
        the series ever since I get to like it. Then comes the anime &#039;&#039;YuGiOh! VRAINS&#039;&#039;... A very YuGiOh like anime that I bet focused on the &#039;&#039;heart of the cards&#039;&#039; things and of course... A card game. (I still dont know why I watch it). So here&#039;s a question.. &#039;&#039;Is this new YuGiOh! anime even worth it? What are the differences?&#039;&#039; We will all come to that.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The story of this anime VRAINS is very simple and yet it&#039;s a detailed one. Guy has a horrible past then after 10 years he becomes a terrorist/hacker invading the so called SAO of YuGiOh which is &#039;&#039;Link VRAINS&#039;&#039; to try and find out who was behind what happened to him and his friend. Simple.. But dark as well.. You see in the YuGiOh franchise, its mostly about gaining superpowers and partners (counterparts) like Yugi with his counterpart, Jaiden with his so called &#039;&#039;sharingan&#039;&#039; eyes, Yusei with his dragon mark, Yuma with his &#039;&#039;ghost&#039;&#039; partner and Yuuya with his 3 counterparts, are all... Common.. That&#039;s why VRAINS offers us &#039;&#039;Playmaker&#039;&#039; or Fujisaki Yuusaku where his only power.. Well.. Pure talent in dueling. He is indeed in fact a hacker but you can&#039;t hack on to someone&#039;s deck when dueling am I rite? The story is fast forward itself. No cliched duels and all. Straight to the point that is why VRAINS is very unique among all the other franchises (and its almost like SAO, though not the plot of SAO just the VR + Card games)<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Simplicity as its finest. Its a good thing they still followed the same art style from the previous YuGiOh franchises because if they don&#039;t, well.. it will be ruined. Not only the character&#039;s art involves here but also how they represent VRAINS itself to be like a massive city of data. It&#039;s impressive.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
A fair sound. For some reason when I hear the opening, the sound just cracks on some parts not only on the opening but some parts of the anime. Ive checked so many times if I have problem with my headphones and all but it was not the gadget&#039;s problem. Its the anime. Though I can proudly say that the sound tension when they duel is quite pleasing and impressive.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
As I said earlier on the &#039;&#039;story&#039;&#039; part, the main character is very unique among all the other YuGiOh main characters/protagonists, but what lacks here is the development of other characters. Hacker will be a hacker, duel idol will be a duel idol. It was quite rigid though the MC&#039;s spotlight is important as well. Since this is still an airing anime, we might see lots of things about the character&#039;s traits and all so get ready!.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
It&#039;s not only the duels that are enjoyable to this show (well almost any YuGiOh franchise out there), but its ending when the MC is on the verge of defeat gives you thrills then when the ending song starts, you are like &#039;&#039;Give me the next episode please!!&#039;&#039;<br />
<br />
Overall.. I rate this anime as a good old 7/10. With its sound being fair, to the MC being different than others and the story&#039;s uniqueness of blending the dueling with straight to the point fights.

    And so ends another Yugioh series. Though ending shorter than expected. Though really, there wasn&#039;t much else you could do with the world they&#039;ve set up. Which isn&#039;t a bad thing really. But it just meant the story wrapped up quicker than expected.<br />
<br />
As for the show itself? It got me back into Yugioh honestly. But I can see that&#039;s not without it&#039;s faults still. While I did enjoy it. There were a few things, like with some of the characters, that weren&#039;t really that great at all. Let alone the pointless recap episodes. Though thankfully those stopped after the first season. <br />
<br />
Sooo...Does Vrains hold up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318300">
        as a Yugioh anime? It does. But certainly isn&#039;t the best at all. But still an alright series overall.

    Yugioh VRAINS taps into the older Yugioh fan brilliantly, while creating a compelling and interesting story-line that always keeps the viewer guessing.<br />
<br />
When I think of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; I always think back to the original manga, and first decade of the franchise, DM, GX, and 5Ds. I think after 5Ds the direction of the franchise became a lot more light hearted, at least for the beginnings of Zexal and Arc-V which I could never really get into. However, VRAINS brilliantly recaptures what made me fall in love with this franchise. While the show is dark and realistic, it is also funny at times which makes for a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265545">
        really good balance. The anime has many complex characters so far, and there are countless amounts of mysteries in the storyline and character lines. So far, VRAINS has been the first Yugioh show to really hook me since Yugioh 5Ds, and I am on edge every episode waiting to see what new secrets and plot lines will be revealed! A must watch, especially for any old school Yugioh fan! You will appreciate the dark tones which made Yugioh, Yugioh.

    Now that the series is over, I can finally give my full review. Honestly, I know this rating seems high, but I truly did get so much emotional impact and enjoyment out of VRAINS. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been a long time fan of YGO, and for a long, long time, GX was my favorite series. VRAINS has finally dethroned it, which is crazy, but I think people don&#039;t give this show enough credit. This is a weekly show designed to sell a card game to you. This is, at it&#039;s core, a children&#039;s card game ad done really, really well. Everything you get on top of exciting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318257">
        duels and cool character designs to get kids interested is a bonus, in my book, and boy did we get a lot of bonuses.<br />
<br />
Spoilers below, but I&#039;ll try and keep them at a minimum.<br />
<br />
STORY: 7/10<br />
Honestly, I liked it. There were clear, consistent parts they wanted to go off of. I think the final villain was hinted at even in early S1, though most people thought it was a red herring. It was pretty cool to see those motivations and reasons for why he became the final villain be shown in the last few episodes. <br />
<br />
S1 was pretty standard, but it was fun. There was nothing really wrong with it. I liked the mystery behind the Ignis and the Hanoi, and I liked how long they kept that going. I thought it was cool that they didn&#039;t just reveal everything or show off Hanoi more often, and it added to the intensity when we did see them. The end of S1 is still a big highlight of the series for me, and the finale duel is probably still my favorite of the show. Really good, emotional stuff.<br />
<br />
S2 got a bit messier, especially with how hard Konami wanted to push a certain meta deck, but it introduced some cool ideas and plot threads, and by episode 70-ish stuff started picking up again and the rest of the season was actually a great watch. I liked S1 more so as a whole, but S2&#039;s last 10 episodes or so were awesome to see play out.<br />
<br />
S3, while obviously rushed do to time, was probably the most emotionally impactful, and I really appreciated how hard they tried with how little time they had. Ever character got some cool moments, the story was interesting to follow, even if at first it left you scratching your head, and while it was minimal at times, it played out really well, even if it left a lot of questions unanswered.<br />
<br />
ART: 7/10<br />
Not much to say here. Liked the animation better than 5Ds overall, lmao. Some episodes were absolutely stunning, some episodes were pretty lackluster and some frames were occasionally hilarious to look at, but for the most part it was fairly consistent and more than acceptable for a long running weekly series like this.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9/10<br />
The soundtrack was fantastic. First time I&#039;ve actually bothered buying an anime OST because I enjoy it that much tbh. The EDs were all really good, the OPs, while they barely ever switched them, were also really good even if I got a bit sick of Go Forward by the end of S2. I know some people didn&#039;t love it, but I really did. Never got tired of hearing most of the OST, which for a weekly 120-ep series, is definitely a good thing.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 9/10<br />
Here&#039;s where people will definitely start to get angry at me, probably, lmao. A lot of people found Yusaku &quot;boring&quot;, but I found him incredibly relatable. Maybe it&#039;s because of my own personal experiences, but hey, this is my own personal review. Revolver is the best rival we&#039;ve seen in a long, long time; best rival in the entire franchise imo. Yes, better than Kaiba. His character development was incredible and it&#039;s worth watching the whole series for him alone, even ignoring the rest of the things I loved about it. Their character arcs were great and I think paced very well.<br />
<br />
The Ignis, too, were all really interesting and different from each other. It was really cool to see their dynamics with each other and with other characters, and I loved how much thought went into their personalities and how they developed.<br />
<br />
The only major complaint I have is with how much they shafted Aoi, but it&#039;s YGO, and they always do the girls dirty anyways. I was just glad she kept her own motivations in tact and still could duel pretty well, even if her record wasn&#039;t great.<br />
<br />
They underutilized the side characters, but when they did appear, they were awesome and super fun to watch, so honestly, it doesn&#039;t bother me as much as it could. Spectre is a great example. He was always a delight to watch duel, whenever he did. Each character also felt distinct, even if they were a usual &quot;trope&quot; from YGO, too, which was cool. Soulburner never felt like just a carbon copy of Crow, even though he was obviously emulating him.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
Yes. I really did enjoy this series this much. I don&#039;t know what it was, what kind of crazy combination made me feel this way, but every second I spent watching this anime I am happy I did. Is it the best series ever? No, not by any stretch of the imagination. But I enjoyed it more than most things I watch, anyways.<br />
<br />
It was a really, really good ride. It was fun, it kept me hyped, it got me to binge watch 76 episodes in under two weeks to catch up last year, AND got me to finally pick up the TCG. So yeah, I really enjoyed it, and it was a successful advertisement lol. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9/10<br />
Only reason I&#039;m not rating it a 10/10 is because of the story. They definitely could&#039;ve done more with the beginning of S1 and S2, but honestly, I&#039;m still so satisfied with what we got. This show is worth your time, even if you only find a few things to really love about it, like Revolver. If you want something a bit more serious like 5Ds, you&#039;ll probably like this.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to mention the recaps because I&#039;m sure everyone already knows the production issues this series was plagued with. But they honestly gave us a pretty cool show with the time/resources they had, and I&#039;ll forever be really happy with it.

    I&#039;m a longtime fan of this franchise and honestly Vrains might be my favorite season of Yugioh (I&#039;ll have to rewatch 5Ds and compare). The best way I can describe the setting for Vrains is &quot;Tron meets Yugioh&quot; where our characters enter this cyber space and duel with avatars while (of course) zipping around on hoverboards. Ever since 5Ds our characters can&#039;t stand still while dueling!! What makes Vrains so good? Well, for me it comes down to one word: the pacing. In so many Yugioh shows we have early episodes chock full of boring filler like that quiz duel in Arc V, but none

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318795">
        of that is here in Vrains. If anything, the pacing was a bit too fast, as we have our hero facing off against the 1st arc villain around episode 12! I appreciate it so much that they cut the bullshit and just gave us story arc after story arc that MATTERED! The first arc I&#039;d say was the best as Playmaker faces Revolver and his Knights of Hanoi. Revolver is easily one of my favorite Yugioh villains. The second arc with Bohman and his little brother kind of sucked, mostly because Bohman was such a weak villain. However, this arc was still important as it led into a huge development in the third and final arc. What a twist! Without fully giving it away, I&#039;ll just say that something happens that causes a main character we thought was a good guy for like 100 episodes to switch sides and become the final boss!? I&#039;ve never seen something like this in anime in general, let alone a Yugioh anime!? My only complaint is the show ended prematurely due to its faster pacing. It reached its natural conclusion about 30 episodes earlier than past Yugioh shows and I wish we could&#039;ve had MORE! Sure, this show isn&#039;t perfect, it&#039;s still based on a trading card game, but I think if you give Vrains a chance it will really surprise you. 8/10

    Oh hey, this is my first review on this website. Let&#039;s start by reviewing the 6th series of the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise, aka Yu-Gi-Oh VRAINS. *minimal spoilers btw*<br />
<br />
Story: 2-5, 6-8 for YGO fans<br />
This is the part that always breaks the YGO animes; card games are never meant to be taken THIS seriously. For non-YGO fans, this will tend to be a turn-off, and honestly, if I wasn&#039;t a long-term fan, I probably would&#039;ve given VRAINS a score of 2 or 3. Overall, the story has potential, and honestly it&#039;s a breath of fresh air because it starts out pretty dark (unlike the past two series). However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263893">
        the series, like most previous YGO animes, suffers from trying to take itself too seriously. Don&#039;t take this the wrong way; I&#039;m just speaking from the perspective of a non-YGO fan. General consensus right now amongst YGO fans is that VRAINS has had a pretty great start, and is still going on strong.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
This would&#039;ve been a lot higher if not for the recent characters (who I believe, had insane potential). Let&#039;s look at our main cast:<br />
<br />
Yusaku - He&#039;s very similar to Yusei and Atem, yet he isn&#039;t. One thing that ticked me off about both of them was their constant blabbering about kizuna and nakama. Yusaku does not do any of that, and is more cold and calculative. I would say that he&#039;s... &quot;Edgy (in a good way).&quot; Let&#039;s stick with that for now. However, the show hints that despite his edginess around others, deep inside, he still wants to be a hero of Link VRAINS. I find his character to be pretty interesting due to this dynamic.<br />
<br />
Aoi - A female protagonist with complexity and actual dueling skills???????? What&#039;s going on? The only time that has ever happened is Aki (who became Mrs. Cheerleader by the end of the series). I love her dynamic with her brother Akira; those two have been my favorites so far in VRAINS. <br />
<br />
Ai - Comic relief for now. Emphasis on &quot;for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Revolver - Honestly, he needs more screentime for someone who&#039;s supposed to be the main rival. Design is cool but really, nothing else to say.<br />
<br />
Go - Great and lovable character, absolutely HORRIBLE design. Seriously, WTF were they thinking -.-<br />
<br />
Ema - Holy crap, another female who&#039;s actually competent. Great design, and interesting character. VRAINS lacks the goody-two-shoes that the past series have had too much of; it&#039;s nice to see a character like Ema.<br />
<br />
I would talk about the new characters (Vyra, Faust, and Dr. Genome) and why they were disappointing, but that would be way too spoiler-heavy. It does feel pretty bad though, they could&#039;ve been great.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8/10<br />
Not really a music critic, but all I can say is that the OP and ED&#039;s have been both catchy. The OST&#039;s are fairly standard, but the voice acting has been great. Aoi&#039;s voice is a bit high-pitched but that&#039;s a minor gripe.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation - 6.5/10<br />
The first 13 episodes had way too dragged out summon animations. Yusaku&#039;s landing animations were also very clunky and low-effort. However, after ep 13, there was a director change, and ever since, the animation has been great. The character designs are pretty good, considering that YGO series tend to have wacky character designs. Again, Go&#039;s design is the only one that I have a major gripe with.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10<br />
I like the series so far. I&#039;m looking forward to its future, and hoping that it doesn&#039;t end up like ARC-V (which had a great start, but had a god-awful ending). As if it wasn&#039;t emphasized enough in the beginning, if you&#039;re not a YGO fan and have no experience with the franchise, you will NOT enjoy this series nor any of the other installments.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10

    Worst Entry of the Main Franchise:<br />
<br />
The concepts were interesting, of course Yugioh would be the one to approach trauma.<br />
<br />
Too bad this is the second-worst batch of character designs this franchise made, and terrible writing that had so much unnecessary techno language that it only served to make one lose interest. The only part where Yu-gi-oh did worse in character design would be season one of Zexal. <br />
<br />
Some designs were good, but they ended up getting overshadowed by the amounts of monstrous-looking characters that will grace your eyes too often for comfort. Not only that, but most of the good character designs had also way too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329552">
        much going on. Yu-gi-oh, for all of its wacky-looking characters, at least all looked decent looking with the multicoloured wacky ass hair. In this version, colours don&#039;t mesh well, and it just looks like some kid just barfed colours over the characters without any sort of colour code. Sorry Yu-gi-oh, this time your character designs were terrible. <br />

    i don&#039;t know about everyone else but the main character is extremely boring and uninteresting the supporting characters aren&#039;t as bad but it still ruins the show<br />
i know for sure everyone hated the recaps and the hideous character designs<br />
they had some interesting plot points but were badly executed/juggled that made them lame like how their way of drawing the card they need to win is through some code storm that you can grab really strong cards once you&#039;re low, but its way too drawn out and takes forever, it also gets really stale. they removed some cool characters, i didn&#039;t watch all of it to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325841">
        know if they get revived or not but i finished the arc and i don&#039;t think they&#039;d come back. I think these problems and several others i haven&#039;t listed because i either forgot or didn&#039;t notice is why it flopped and this turned out to be the shortest series (maybe until ygo sevens comes out because that one looks really bad)

    Every Yugioh series is based on something that occured way back in the past. This one is no different, but it does it better. Vrains is all about setling things with the past. Lost Jiken is what gonna move not just the MC, but all the villains in the series. Playmaker, and Soulburner later too, seeks justice, Revolver seeks to attone the sins of his father. The second season brings some discussions about Artifical Inteligence and freewill, the importance of the limits of our free will. The last part of Vrains unite both and brings the meaning of life. Playmaker beliving in no absolute truth,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319094">
        but in the human bounds as the substance of life (what is true, but doesnt make sense at all). Ai seeks the ultimate meaning in life, &quot;If there is no final answer, than is better not to live&quot;. Revolver belives in the ultimate meaning, the afterlife, and i belive that this is the meaning of the last scene.

The art work is distinct in its style and each character is recognizable whether it&#039;s by their oddly colored and oddly shaped hair, or their facial features which have a certain level of distinctness with no set face being bad or good. The art is generally vibrant and when the monsters are cg it flows well with the rest of the background.<br />
<br />
Cons(Art)-<br />
At some points the art is warped and the characters look unlike themselves.  There is nothing overwhelming or never before seen, but it isn&#039;t the worst.<br />
<br />
Overall(Art)-<br />
The art is good just needs a little bit of tinkering in certain places.<br />
<br />
2. Pros(Character)-<br />
Each character has their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318350">
        own believable motivations , distinct from others in the cast. Each motivation is influenced by the past as well as the hopes in the future. The plot while having some effect on the characters generally doesn&#039;t sway character motivations dramatically after hearing one exchange of words. Furthermore the characters(especially Yusaku) are believable in their trauma, pain, and how they outwardly express it. Lighthearted moments (with Ai mostly)  give perspective to the tenuous feelings the cast has within themselves, as well as the others.<br />
<br />
Cons(Character)-<br />
At times, it feels like the character growth attained is lost yet again in an endless cycle(Looking at Go Onizuka- Side note Hate him). Sometime it feels like characters like Aoi, and Ghost Girl didn&#039;t need the emphasis they had because it never felt like they influenced the plot or Yusaku as people like Ryoken and Takeru do.  <br />
<br />
Overall(Character)- Certain characters needed to be cut and others needed expansion, but those that were well developed are honestly easy to understand and very quick to bring out feelings of love and protection(personally that&#039;s how I feel ).<br />
<br />
Pros(Enjoyment)-<br />
When the duels have weight behind them and are intricate as well as interesting well that&#039;s when the enjoyment skyrockets. I also especially love when the characters show flashes of emotions between scenes coinciding with flashbacks(b/c sort of kind or reminds me of the itachi arc[within naruto]) .  Like all things it gives more insight into the characters and their situation, because ,otherwise why would they think to remember any of this shit.<br />
<br />
Cons(Enjoyment)-<br />
Most episodes aren&#039;t spectacular and there&#039;s quite a lot of recap. Also, most episodes are generic and some boss battles don&#039;t live up to the hype one expects.<br />
<br />
Overall(Enjoyment)- When it&#039;s good , it&#039;s real damn good, when it&#039;s bad it&#039;s passable but nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
Pros(Sound)- <br />
The OP&#039;s and ED&#039;s fit the anime so well and are so goddamn catchy, I absolutely adore it!!!<br />
<br />
Cons(Sound)-<br />
Too catchy...?<br />
<br />
Overall(Sound)-<br />
Pretty damn good :)<br />
<br />
Pros(Story)-<br />
Futuristic scientific world plays well with themes story introduces. It makes sense with the development of technology and doesn&#039;t feel like its outside the realm of possibility.<br />
<br />
Cons(Story)-<br />
Can feel repetitive if watched at a stretch. Sometimes there a lot of loopholes our protagonist can use to get out of sticky situations. Also at times things are over explained like the Ignis but somethings are under explained like how Sol technologies has such a monopoly on Vrains. <br />
<br />
Overall(Story)- Yugioh is no unique in its story but its worth watching despite that.<br />
<br />
Overall(Overall)-  It&#039;s an easy show to enjoy that doesn&#039;t require much brain power to watch. It&#039;s fairly good and the characters are mostly enjoyable.

    currently,vrains is much more interesting then most of it&#039;s previous series(Arc v and Zexal) arc v is good in the beginning episodes and ending episodes after around the time where they dimension hope,it got boring. zexal is straight b***shit. since 5ds,they have not made any really good series but vrains,took the high school setting and mix in with the mature themes in 5ds which is really good.the art style for the characters are still the same but the CG is really good,where you compare the CG with pass series like zexal or Aec v,where both series have decent CG only some time they did&#039;t include

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256792">
        it,vrains CG make them look so old school.the character them self are a little plain other AI.There is the edgy main character who only have one friend and forgotten about his past,the main character&#039;s friend who is quite useless who is just there so that the MC will have a goal to fight the bad guy,the girl who obey the brother but also rebel against him,the brother who is famous and have authority,the useless big size rival and the usually bad guy organization

    VRAINS is awesome to watch you have to watch it, it has amazing story plot my rate is 9.5/10 it&#039;s better than original show it&#039;s probably my best anime ever.<br />

    (This review may contain slight spoilers)<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Yu☆Gi☆Oh! VRAINS is the 6th and so far, the final spin-off, (or sequel if you can fit it in the timeline) of the entire Yu☆Gi☆Oh! franchise. It&#039;s original and modern since it mixes old school (card games) with the modern world (VR and AI). It kind of reminds me of SAO except this is way better. Unlike the previous anniversary series Arc-V, this anime does not necessarily focus much on references but it is quite subtle via Playmaker&#039;s Ace Monsters.<br />
<br />
In comparison to how bad it was for me during Zexal and Arc-V&#039;s time, Vrains actually tried and sort of succeeded

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356619">
        in being acceptably good. It&#039;s not 5D&#039;s but I would argue that some of its recap episodes are bearable compared to how boring it was for me during 5D&#039;s Yliaster saga. The last arc did feel quite rushed but it was my favorite out of all three<br />
<br />
Now, about the recap episodes, there&#039;s only 7 in total. That&#039;s nothing compared to the big shounen out there and while most of them happened in the first 70 episodes (which may piss some people off who is already on the way to the second arc) personally I didn&#039;t see it as something that bad, especially if you&#039;re looking at them AFTER the series has ended<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
I really liked it! Despite the absence of Pendulum Summoning, the remake of the artworks of each of the Summoning mechanics is superb, with Synchro being my favorite. Sadly this is the last animation by Gallop, so we won&#039;t see much anymore unless they make another iteration and goes back I guess<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
When it comes to all the Yugioh series, I would say that either GX or Arc-V has the best song but what Vrains offers in exchange is, excuse my lack of a better term but &quot;mature feeling&quot; to some of its songs, particularly &quot;Writing Life&quot; I also liked how the first OP was sung by the same guy who sung the first OP of Jojo&#039;s. Yugioh and Jojos have some subtle (or maybe obvious?) things in common and those who see it appreciate it better<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Arc-V almost made it to making another &quot;Aki&quot; via the bracelet girls, particularly Serena but sort of failed by the Academia arc. In Vrains&#039; case, while GG and Aoi were cool on the first arc, like with the previous iterations they slowly lost general importance and have sunken down to cannon fodder for the villains before they were defeated by Yusaku, I also sort of disliked Soulburner because he&#039;s too much of a Shounen main protagonist. Hell he&#039;s even voiced by Kaji Yuki, that pretty much says everything. Onizuka, Zaizen and almost everybody else is meh. I did like Lightning and Blood Shepherd though. Bohman&#039;s ok.<br />
<br />
But by the end, the separation of Ai and Yusaku (noting to Yugi and Atem, Yuma and Astral&#039;s) separation was pure nostalgia and summarizes the themes of the franchise entirely (Sorry Judai and Yubel)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall<br />
<br />
Need I say more? I love it. Go watch it and experience it instead of relying on &quot;critics&quot; and numbers. <br />

    Warning: This review is going to be from the words of an SAO fan.<br />
<br />
Story: As far as story is concerned, the Yugioh writers seem to hype up their game. Inspite of the recap episodes, it has managed to stay consistent with its pacing and storytelling. Already, it is a massive improvement from Arc-V, with had a strong beginning and fell flat at the end. Also, its plot seems to take the Yugioh series in a different direction, to the direction of VR (which SAO established first), but inspite of that, it succeeds at doing its own thing, without much linkage to SAO.<br />
<br />
Art: The art is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290602">
        quite spectacular, with top-notch summoning animations that felt like an upgrade from the previous series, however I have watched several anime (including DSoD) with stellar animations, so this one is kinda meh, especially since it doesn&#039;t bring its big guns often, but when it matters, it makes a huge impact.<br />
<br />
Sound: Oh boy, what can I say? I was definitely invested in the openings and endings as of this moment.<br />
<br />
Character: Now this is a more controversial topic, but I&#039;m going to do my best on this.<br />
<br />
Yusaku: Blah blah blah, he&#039;s the new Kirito/Yusei. I think we&#039;ve all heard this before. But I don&#039;t think Yusaku resembles Kirito in any way aside from being good with computers. He more so resembles Reki Kawahara&#039;s 3rd protagonist (who doesn&#039;t have an anime adaptation yet), Minoru Utsugi. They both have a troubled past that led them to be excluded from others. While this isn&#039;t a spectacularly written style of character, it&#039;s interesting to see Yusaku change his perception of Ai, even little by little.<br />
<br />
Ai: Ai is the centerpoint of VRAINS. The plot is focused on him and his Ignis brethren. He also provides most of the comic relief of the show (until Takeru and Flame). As for him specifically, maybe it&#039;s because I was used to Yui, but I didn&#039;t really feel that Ai would be special until the end of season 1.<br />
<br />
Aoi: If Yusaku is Minoru, then Aoi would be Yumiko Azu (again from the not-animated series known as the Isolator). Sadly, she seems to be on the receiving end of writers bias (as most female characters are), so she may never resolve her character, which up until Season 1, has been to get recognition from her brother, and now it&#039;s to help others.<br />
<br />
Takeru: Best sidekick in all of Yugioh (especially with his dynamic with Flame).<br />
<br />
Revolver: Best rival in all of Yugioh.<br />
<br />
Everyone else: Only relevant if the plot makes them so.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Originally it was a 7-8, but with a war about to happen, it immediately shot up to 10.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10
