    I found myself stuck in the puddle of mediocrity that is 2014 summer season. Akame ga Kill, Tokyo Ghoul, Aldnoah.Zero and SAO II. I was slowly losing my faith in anime and on several occasions I thought that I should try to go outside my room and socialize with other Homo Sapiens. It was that bad.<br />
<br />
Then...<br />
<br />
Then I saw a pillar.<br />
<br />
A pillar of hope.<br />
<br />
A pillar of testosterone and manlyness.<br />
<br />
A pillar of Jojo.<br />
<br />
Story: 10 pillars of hope/10 pillars of hope<br />
<br />
&quot;This makes my plays look like Mars of Destruction in comparison&quot; -William Shakespeare<br />
<br />
Where do I begin? At the start most likely. It starts with  our hero Jotaro

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159371">
        Kujo (This parts Jojo) sitting in a prison cell. You will be asking yourself: &quot;How can such a man, who is the manfistation of coolness and manlyness be stuck in prison?&quot; Then you find out he has put himself in a cell to protect people from the &quot;evil spirit&quot; that is possessing him. Now something will happen to you, but don&#039;t worry. It&#039;s just your body reacting to the heroic and noble sacrifice done by our protagonist. Ejaculations and sudden hysterical crying is normal.<br />
<br />
Then he finds out that this &quot;evil spirit&quot; is something called a stand. A stand is a supernatural power that curtain individuals can use and each stand has different powers and different strenghts. Therefore to defeat different stands different strategies is needed. Jojo will bring Sun Tzu to shame with it&#039;s genius tactics and strategies.<br />
<br />
Due to certain events Jotaro&#039;s mother gets infected by a stand and is dying. The only way to save her is by defeating the evil Dio (WARNING: wear swimming trousers each time he apears, because your panties will be wet after each time Dio has an appearance)  who has haunted the Joestar family for years. So our hero goes on a journey like no other to defeat Dio and save his mother. <br />
<br />
The plot is full of plot twists and asks alot of philosophical questions and answers them as well. The plot is complex like no other and is so well written I found myself suddenly crying because of how good and intriguing it was. After having watched Jojo I see the world in a different light and my IQ has been raised by 8 points. It&#039;s that deep and philosphical.<br />
<br />
Art: 18 reroreros/ 4,8 reroreros<br />
<br />
&quot;If only my art was this good&quot;- Pablo Picasso<br />
<br />
Your eyes are not decieving you. The art is truly this manly and fabulous. Currently in 18 nations around the planet Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is banned because the art is so good it counts as a drug. The art is so good and testorene filled that it&#039;s addictive. Yes. It is that good.<br />
<br />
On several occasions I found myself drooling on the fantastisc artwork and character designs. Normally one would wonder why people are wearing school uniforms during a journey to the other side of the world, but not in Jojo, because it looks so good on them. Studios such as Ufotable, Shaft and Madhouse has a few things to learn here when it comes to amazing artwork.<br />
<br />
Sound: 389 Oraora&#039;s/ 217,82 Oraora&#039;s<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that I have heard the voice acting and ost of Jojo i can die happy&quot; -Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart<br />
<br />
I never thought perfection existed in this world. That was until I watched Jojo. Your ears will bleed of pure ecstacy while watching Jojo. Everytime I heard a &quot;Oh No&quot; or &quot;Oh my god&quot; coming from Joseph I had a ejaculation and nothing can prepare your body for &quot;rerorero&quot;. &quot;Rerorero&quot; made all the citizens of a small village in Siberia cut off their own ears, because they knew they would never hear anything that good aver again.<br />
<br />
My earphones exploded on several occasions, because it could&#039;t handle Jojo&#039;s voice acting. I&#039;m now on my 23rd headphones. The voices fit the characters so good you will be thinking: &quot;Were the voice actors born just to play these roles?&quot; Yes they were. In several interviews the voice actors have confirmed that they have since birth feeled that they were born to be voice actors for Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5 wet panties/5 wet panties<br />
<br />
&quot;God, I wish I was as cool and smooth as Jotaro&quot; -Immanuel Kant<br />
<br />
The characters of Stardust Crusaders is the best part. You might think: &quot;They can&#039;t possibly be that good?&quot; and let me tell you this: they&#039;re not. THEY ARE BETTER!<br />
<br />
First our lead Jotaro who is the embodiment of coolness. Jotaro is noble and manly like few other. Every episode you will scream out in despar: &quot;How can Jotaro get out of this?&quot; And each time Jotaro will use his manlyness and godlike intellegence and win against all odds. Side effects of this is you standing up screaming: &quot;F*CK YEAH!&quot; on several occasions. You will find yourself striving to be like Jotaro for the rest of your life after having seen him in action.<br />
<br />
The side characters are also superb. They all bring their own distinct personalities, ideals and struggles to the story. You will find yourself drowning in different ideoligies and moralities. You will also start questioning your own morality and ideals thanks to this show.<br />
<br />
The side characters are also fleshed out and gets development. When you are finished with this show you it will feel like you have known these characters for years, no, DECADES. <br />
<br />
The show is also full of grey morality. The villains are fleshed out like no other and even brins Legend of the Galactic Heroes to shame with it&#039;s grey morality. You will feel for both the protagonists and the antagonists throughout this adventure.<br />
<br />
Enjoment/Overall: 10 manly tears/10 manly tears<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had to only watch one anime in my life, it would be Jojo&quot; -Aristotle<br />
<br />
I shed manly tears. I laughed. I was moved emotionally and I will never be the same man again.<br />
<br />
 This show is the show that saved anime summer season 2014 for me( it&#039;s not even a part of the summer season.) <br />
<br />
Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is not only an anime. It is a piece of art. Words cannot even begin to describe it&#039;s manlyness and fabulousness. I can only describe a small part of all the testosterone. <br />
<br />
You should all watch Jojo over all the other mediocries that is currently airing and to help you understand that I have written this review. There is no need to thank me. Thank Jojo for being so amazing. Now, go! Go and watch Jojo!  <br />
<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
I couldn&#039;t just stop at the first season, seeing as the Part 5 anime just ended I&#039;ve decided to look back on the entire Jojo anime, from Dio to Diavolo and tell you why I believe Jojo is the most overpraised anime to have come out so far. Part 3 is without a shadow of doubt the most iconic arc in all of Jojo, when someone thinks of Jojo, they usually think of this, it&#039;s what cemented Jojo as a staple of Shounen, it was the first arc to get its own video game, it was the first arc to be adapted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314063">
        into an anime, it was the first part to be released outside of Japan, it&#039;s also had the biggest impact on popular culture, being referenced in a multitude of anime and video games, it&#039;s also, in my opinion, the worst part in all of Jojo by a country mile.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s start with the story, or lack thereof, simply put, the first season of part 3 is filler, and by filler, I don&#039;t mean stuff they added in for the anime, no no no, I mean most of the episodes have no impact on the story or characters, no one develops, oh sure, some characters go from bad to good but that&#039;s because they were under mind control, so it doesn&#039;t really count.<br />
<br />
Now to be fair, the first 5 or so episodes do set up the plot and characters, but after that, only one plot relevant thing happens before the season finale, none of the characters develop, they are the same boring cardboard cut outs from beginning to end, Kakyoin from episode 2 is the exact same person in episode 24, same goes for Avdol, Joseph, and Jotaro, the only character who develops is Polnareff, who goes from &quot;I wanna avenge my sister&#039;s death by finding her killer&quot; to &quot;I wanna kill Dio&quot;, thrilling.<br />
<br />
One thing I&#039;ve noticed is that this arc is where Araki developed his horrible habit of introducing plot points, characters, powers etc, and then forgetting about them almost immediately, a great example of this is Kakyoin, when we first meet Kakyoin he&#039;s painting Jotaro, he paints red over Jotaro&#039;s knee and then Jotaro gets a cut on his leg, this ability is never seen or mentioned again, then Kakyoin&#039;s stand ability is changed to possession, it&#039;s a pretty overpowered ability, which is why it&#039;s dropped almost immediately and is only used once more. Another example is Star Platinum, when it&#039;s introduced it seems to have a mind of its own, it brings Jotaro stuff while he&#039;s in prison (which contradicts its later established 5 meter range), and it makes Jotaro believed he&#039;s possessed, this is never explained and Star Platinum never shows autonomy again, it also demonstrates the ability to stretch its fingers and deliver a small but powerful blow the instantly kills an enemy, this ability is also forgotten about. Now I can understand an author forgetting about something like that gradually, but Araki forgets almost instantly, so either he can&#039;t come up with creative ways to use these simplistic abilities in more than one fight scene, or he has a really bad case of dementia. Araki&#039;s forgetfulness gets much worse as the series progresses, but this is where it started.<br />
<br />
For fun I decided to see how much time this first season wastes, the team is established by episode 5, their is a plot important 2 parter, another 2 parter which undoes a plot point in the aforementioned previous 2 parter, and the finale is also important, so that&#039;s 11 plot relevant episodes...in a 24 episode season, meaning 54% of this season can be skipped over and you&#039;d miss nothing.<br />
<br />
The story is structured in a really formulaic way, the group travels to a location, one of the characters meets a stand user, they fight the stand user and are either beaten or trapped, then they fight them again and win, through either a stupidly complex strategy, or in Jotaro&#039;s case, through punching, this formula is used in almost every episode, and it gets old really quick.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
<br />
The main cast is completely bland and forgettable, Jotaro, the supposed main character of the part is about as interesting and well defined as a child&#039;s first original character, he&#039;s meant to be a delinquent type, but besides occasionally being rude or dismissive I never really got that vibe from him, he&#039;s just a boring and emotionless mary sue who wins every fight by punching really hard, remember Joseph with his tactical expertise and complex strategies? Yeah that was sooo boring, let&#039;s replace him with another shounen protagonist who wins every fight by just punching. Speaking of Joseph, the silly yet cunning and strategic Joseph has been reduced to a screaming old man, Old Joseph is mean to be the arc&#039;s &quot;comic relief&quot; but he has one joke, the joke being that he screams phrases in English like 3 times an episode, yeah, I know right, comedy gold, I&#039;m sure it was worth sacrificing your most interesting character yet Araki. Kakyoin is just, there, I&#039;ve described characters as &quot;bland&quot; a lot when talking about Jojo, but I can&#039;t even use that to describe Kakyoin since he has no personality, like I can&#039;t tell you a single thing about him as a character. What I said about Kakyoin can also be applied to Avdol except he&#039;s even more forgettable since he&#039;s absent for a good chunk of the season.<br />
<br />
The only mildly interesting character is Polnareff, Polnareff&#039;s entire personality is that he&#039;s impulsive and stupid and often gets himself into trouble, yeah it doesn&#039;t sound like much but he at least has a personality that&#039;s easy to describe, he also has an interesting motivation, he doesn&#039;t want to kill Dio at all, he&#039;s just after the man who killed his sister, and once he finds and kills him he loses the only interesting thing about him and becomes just as bland as the rest of the main cast.<br />
<br />
The only really interesting character is minor antagonist Hol Horse, he portrays himself as this confident, smooth talking and charismatic lady&#039;s man often acting like a cowboy from an old western, but in reality he&#039;s a coward who&#039;s way in over head and has deluded himself, not too well developed but really fun to watch, too bad he only gets 3 episodes of screentime in this season. Hol Horse is the only antagonist worth mentioning, all of the others are just obstacles for the protagonists to clear, most of their personalities are comparable to that of a Power Rangers monster, in fact towards the end of the season they stop showing up for the most part, they just use their stands to fight from a distance and you only see them after they&#039;ve been defeated or killed. Oh yeah Dio&#039;s here, he does nothing, he just waits around in his mansion, occasionally talking to this one witch who&#039;s built up but killed almost as easily as the rest of the villains<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
The art and animation is about on part with season 1, it&#039;s great, read my review for season 1 for more details.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The music is a slight improvement over season 1&#039;s already great music, there are a lot more memorable tunes, such as Jotaro&#039;s theme, Kakyoin&#039;s theme and the OP, Walk Like An Egyptian was a great choice from the ED.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
<br />
Part 3 is just awful, I see no point in watching it other than for the fight scenes, but even then you could just watch them on YouTube, so is it really worth sitting through 24 episodes of (mostly) no story and the blandest set of characters in anime history?

    A new season of manliness, a new season of awesomeness, a new season of crazy onomatopoeias, impossible poses and clichéd phrases which are so awesome that will make you forget that they are really cliché. Here it is, a new season of JoJo´s Bizarre Adventures and it will be this Cat´s pleasure to review it.<br />
<br />
Welcome to The Neko´s review of JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders.<br />
<br />
As we know, JoJo is divided into several parts, each with it´s own character, own plot but with similar style. Stardust Crusaders is the third part of the whole Jojo´s Bizarre Adventures franchise and works as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160183">
        sequel to the first season of Jojo, which included parts 1 and 2, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency.<br />
The series starts with the revelation of DIO´s comeback to the series, who is after the remaining Joestars heads, and the journey of the new Jojo, Jotaro Kujo, and his companions in order to exterminate DIO once and for all.<br />
This time the series took a more episodic nature and replaced the Hamon by new powers called Stands, a manifestation of psychic powers that takes the form of any given character´s Alter Ego. I can only imagine all the Jojo fans, when this was published in the manga, going &quot;Awww my GAWD, that is soooooooo AWESOME&quot;, because even if now it´s not THAT original, when the manga was first published it was a kinda big deal. Now we have things like Persona that do things like that, but Jojo is different in the aspect that here Stands can take ANY form, ranging from an enormous ship to a little insect, each with its own abilities and weaknesses. So this episodic nature that the series took this time is shown in a ‘Stand User of the week’ format. Bad guy appears, Jojo and his friends have to deal with him, they have trouble at first, then they find a way to beat him and then they win in the most awesome way possible...most of the times. While there are some really fun, filled with action and comedy episodes, there are also a lot of episodes that end up being either boring or completely irrelevant, such as The Sun episode. This happens because the author of the manga thought that it would be cool to have the Stands named after Tarot cards, the thing is that then he had to use them all leading to some really unnecessary episodes here and there. The episodic nature of the show can also be bothersome to some people since Part 1 and 2 had a more over arching story. Also, this season is only the first half of Stardust Crusaders with more to come in 2015, so its ending really doesn´t conclude anything, nothing to worry about since its continuation is already announced.<br />
But of course, this is still Jojo so we still have the things that make Jojo what it is, bizarre comedy, lots of action and cool phrases, so if you liked season 1 then you will most likely enjoy this season anyway.<br />
<br />
The artwork in Season one wasn´t the best there is because of the short budget, but they still compensated with filters and colour changing to make it look cool enough despite the short budget. This time they have more money and it shows, the animation is more fluid, colours are more vivid and backgrounds are more detailed but they still keep all the things that made the first season´s animation so cool, all the change of colours, all the onomatopoeias, all the style is still here and it looks better than ever. The character designs are still Jojo too, lots of muscles and the cool hairstyles are still here. Jotaro´s design is the one I liked the most, it served its purposed which is to make him look like a badass.<br />
<br />
In this part we have a new set of main characters starring the new JoJo, Jotaro Kujo and his friends, Mohammed Avdol, Jean Pierre Polnareff, Kakyoin Noriaki and the old version of Battle Tendency´s Jojo, the fabulous Joseph Joestar, Jotaro´s grandfather. Sadly, Jotaro didn´t live up to my expectations as a protagonist, he was to much of a badass protagonist than anything else, and is a kind of bland character. It seemed as if he was too forced into being a badass and that had it´s consequences. He lacked a lot of the charisma that the previous JoJo, Joseph, had. Still, he isn´t by any means a dislikeable character, but he is far from being one of my favourites.<br />
Speaking of Joseph, he is back as an old version of himself this season, and boy did he make me worry at first. In the first couple of episode he was presented as a mature old man, almost completely different to the original Joseph Joestar, and I was &quot;But...is this really the Joseph that we all know and love?&quot; and it wasn´t until he starred in one episode that this series said &quot;FUCK YES HE IS!&quot; leading to one of the best episodes in the series where we get to hear his old phrases such as &quot;OOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOO&quot; and &quot;Your next line will be...&quot;, so yeah, Joseph is still awesome.<br />
On the other hand we got Avdol and Kakyoin as supporting characters who had some moments to shine here and there but there is nothing that stands out that much, they are nice characters, but I wouldn´t say they are amazing. Polnareff on the other hand was the source of most of the usual bizarre comedy and with his joyful personality (most of the time) he ended up being one of the more likeable characters of Stardust Crusaders, at least until now.<br />
Sadly even if DIO came back we still don´t get to see much of him and his fabulousness on screen, he does have a couple of scenes, but for now he doesn´t do much, since he is to cool to go out and kill all the Joestars by himself. We have secondary villains every episode, but the only ones that stand out are Hol Horse and Enyaba, with other less important villains such as The Empress, which are more funny that any other thing.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack in this part is composed Yugo Kanno who, as redundant as it may sound, isn´t Taku &quot;God&quot; Iwasaki, the composer of Battle Tendency. As such the only track that really stood out was the Main Theme, Stardust Crusaders, with the rest of the soundtrack being kinda forgettable. In the other hand the voice acting is still great for the most part, every seiyuu did a grat job with it´s character, the only complain I have is with Jotaro, voiced by Daisuke Ono, since his voiced lacked some emotion, even in moments where Jotaro gets hit, it´s not really his fault but is still weird see Jotaro getting damaged and still not showing any sign of emotion, not even in his voice.<br />
This season features only one Opening and one Ending, the opening being &quot;Stand Proud&quot; by Jin Hashimoto, a song that, as always, captures almost perfectly the essence of the Part, is a hit-or-miss song, but for me it was a really cool theme. The ending is of course an 80&#039;s song, &quot;Walk like an Egyptian&quot; by the Bangles, is a nice song, but I still prefer the opening one.<br />
<br />
As always Jojo´s Bizarre Adventures is still a really enjoyable instalment of the franchise, with some boring episodes here and there, sure, but enjoyable indeed. If you liked season one then there´s probably no reason why you shouldn´t watch this one, because even if it´s not as good as the first one in my honest opinion, at least not yet, it still has most of the things that made Season one so great.<br />
<br />
Disappointed? Maybe a little since I was hearing so much things about this being the best part of Jojo´s Bizarre Adventures, and I still prefer Battle Tendency over this one, but this still provided me with lots of fun every week, more than what can be said about other series this season, and it is still Jojo, with its poses, its phrases, its over the top action and its bizarre comedy it will surely be enough to satisfy anyone who is looking for some MANLINESS this year. Now the second half is coming out on Winter of 2015 and I am not planning to miss it.<br />
<br />
This has been The Neko and I wish you have a nice day/night.

    Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures: Stardust Crusaders is more than just a classic adventure filled with bizarreness. Taking a journey into this show is an experience like no other when it comes to creativity. It’ll be like riding a roller coaster that will leave you with the impression of giddiness and “oh what the bloody hell”. But if you think that now, just wait until you find out what our heroes has to blaze through. It’s more than just hell as they become crusaders in this adventure to fulfill their destiny.<br />
<br />
Continuing from where Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure (2012) left off, Stardust Crusaders adapts Araki Hirohiko’s manga of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160057">
        same name. The series takes place in the year of 1989 where we meet Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of Joseph Joestar. After discovering that he is possessed by a mysterious psychic force, Jotaro comes to realize that this manifestation is dubbed as “Stands”. The story gets more complex as Jotaro’s own mother, Holly develops a Stand of her own (due to family origins) that threatens her very own existence. Realizing that Dio Brando is responsible for such development, Jotaro starts the crusade to rid of his influence.<br />
<br />
An important element to take notice from Stardust Crusaders is the introduction of Stands. The concept becomes a prominent device for progress as we witness how they function and adapt to present a credible story. Essentially, Araki experimented with the idea of these Stands as manifestations. The first Stand we see in the series, the Star Platinum, becomes a pivotal figure. What originally seemed like a mad idea becomes enveloped with creativity as witness the diversity of the Stands presented throughout the series. Characters who develop Stands utilize them for a variety of purposes. But what’s more important is that some of them even reflect a side of their persona. The show succeeds with this concept by connecting the idea of Stands with its characters and story to bring about a Jojo pantheon. It does seem like a gamble at first but the risk pays off. The show colorfully depicts Stands through their powers and inspirations that are thought provoking. No Stand looks alike and all of them possess a different power. It creates a thrilling atmosphere of eccentricity as it will make you curious. It will make you wonder and evoke a process to dissect what Araki does with his idea. And honestly, this idea is pure genius.<br />
<br />
Like the previous series, Stardust Crusaders also follows the adventure of Jojo and his experiences. Joining him includes Joseph Joestar from its prequel as well as new characters. What’s important about these new characters is that they all have their own Stand. But even more so is the way they develop over as the story progresses. Nothing is really complex about their persona and is fairly straightforward. Perhaps it could be even colored bizarre such as some of the habits of our main characters such as Kakyoin or Polnareff. The show also offer a fair chance for each of the main characters to get their spotlight. This is justified by some of the reasons why these characters join Jotaro on his journey. For instance, Polnareff brings himself along in order to deliver vengeance against a man that took the life of his dear sister. The show intertwines sub-plots during the journey to provide a closure to various story driven plots. <br />
<br />
Like its main character cast, the antagonists of the series offer a complex mixture. It’s like a theatrical showdown every time as our heroes deal with threats throughout their journey. They meet antagonists with diverse personalities, some with definite purpose while others treats our crusaders like a game. I think it’s safe to say that the hunters become the hunted. Furthermore, the man pulling the strings behind the scenes (Dio) is often portrayed as a mastermind. And as a man of complex nature, the show crafts its story carefully as Dio’s arsenal of militias goes to work at the most strangest of places. The antagonists’ Stands are also named after tarot cards with some incredible powers to really push the limits of our heroes. Their unique nature and complexity of their powers bring about Araki’s creativity. His ideas comes to crucial play here as each Stand find their niche in this adventure. It expands more than just inventiveness though as some of the Stands also provoke laughter and emotions. For what it’s worth, the Stands and antagonists are like a pair of column that holds the story in place. They not only test the wits of the crusaders where they must think outside the box to prevail but also stimulate emotions. As the story progresses, we find out more about the true nature of some of the main characters as well.<br />
<br />
Starring protagonist Jotaro remains the most prominent cast member of the crusaders. Even to this date, he is perhaps the most well-known Jojo from the franchise. On the surface, he may be seen as a cold figure with an indifferent outlook on life while displaying his delinquent-like personality. Yet deep down, he truly does care about his friends and family. This is clearly shown throughout the journey with his words and action with characters such as Ann. Similarly, other main characters show their selfless nature. While some shows it differently than others, it’s evident that they truly care about their comrades. It becomes a highlight reel once you stay with the focus involving the main characters because of their personalities. Each of them may come from different backgrounds but their union together as crusaders is like a brotherhood. It has the feelings, bonding, and is amazing to realize that a journey can bring some strangers together in full circle.<br />
<br />
With its adventurous mood, the show also explores a variety of territories featuring all sorts of terrain. The show covers a decent amount of ground in the first half as they journey towards Egypt to stop Dio. Throughout this journey, the wonders of the adventure can be felt with what characters discover involving different cultures. And despite its supernatural conventions, the show also has bits of realism and can even be relatable when it comes to culture. It can be easily indulged to fulfill elements of creativity through Araki’s concepts. Although the story itself sometimes may feel like a “Monster of the Week” formula with limited development, it’s also important realize the experiment that the author is bringing into his work. In retrospect though, the series isn’t very well written when it comes to explaining certain points. The series has many plot holes that perhaps will never be explained and is left to the imaginative minds of the viewers. While this may seem like a backstabber at first, the show instead cleverly delivers its dynamics and entertaining factors. With or without the bizarreness, Jojo SC’s plot isn’t one that strives to achieve logic. It aims to achieve its purpose to deliver bizarreness. This might come as a mixed bag for some people as the oddball humor could get out of control. The ‘monster of the week’ formulation might not also be suitable for some viewers through its context.<br />
<br />
The artwork of Jojo SC is formidable when it comes to visual presentation. Character designs reflects the classic style of the franchise while retaining its purpose. Every Stand in the show looks different with emphasis on their design and the bizarreness. The fights are also well coordinated that explodes onto the screen with energy. To add to the flavor are humorous gimmicks and dialogues coming from the heart of our characters. And similar to the previous season, trademark phrases such as ‘ORA ORA ORA’ are timed fabulously to grab a viewer’s attention. As discussed before, the show’s settings have a variety of backgrounds and each of them convey it well when it comes to delivery. Ranging from mountainous terrain, to foggy ghost towns, or even aboard an aircraft, the show achieves its adventurous tone. David Production surely deserves some praise for their superior animation quality here.<br />
<br />
Similarly, soundtrack plays a strong role throughout the show. The OP song &quot;STAND PROUD&quot; by Jin Hashimoto envelops itself with a fast paced coordination with decorative montages of the main characters with hints of foreshadowing. On the other hand, the ED song &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; delivers its theme of Egypt to the core. OST is also impressive especially during climatic scenarios. Even when the mood seems to be calm, the OST creates a feeling of thrilling experience to show that our heroes are always in danger during their journey. Characters voices are impressive to say the least on most parts whether it’s Jotaro’s stoic mannerisms, Kakyoin’s outgoing personality, or Joseph’s wisdom. Oh and of course, don’t forget that ORA ORA ORA on the door to the way out.<br />
<br />
An epic journey is perhaps what Jojo Stardust Crusaders should be essentially known for. But it expands more than that with the characters, gimmicks, and overall clever writing. While it’s not one of the smartest adventure tale with the history books, Jojo SC is a blockbuster with its exceptional creativity. I’m not just referring to the Stands or characters but also the humor it strives to deliver. It doesn’t go diehard mode with its comedy but instead scales the performance of the characters to bring them at their best during the journey. Perhaps the story plot holes can be a bit frustrating to deal with at times. However, mincing it down is silly when a show with this amount of bizarreness. If for some reason that you decide to go full Sherlock Holmes and try to find these plot holes, then the experience of this show would not suit you well. You’ll be missing out the entertainment as Stardust Crusaders elevates bizarreness in a fashionable way like never before.  <br />

    I saw various clips from Stardust Crusaders before I was even familiar with the whole JoJo scene. so I did the obvious, I started watching the 2012 version of the Bizarre Adventure and work my way up to watching Stardust Crusaders. But in all honesty the prequel was clearly better.<br />
<br />
The typical trope in any shonen-type show is a character starting off with a very low amount of skill, but an incredible amount of potential. this is what invests you into watching a show like this, you wish to see the characters evolve, improve themselves, learn new ability&#039;s etc.<br />
<br />
Despite the flaws the original bizarre adventure had,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190714">
        I was invested in Jonothan and Joseph Joestar because they kept showing me new things, and interesting way&#039;s to use their powers. however In this series we get introduced to &quot;The Stands&quot; spiritual manifestations which reside in our main cast members and do the fights for them. a very fresh concept, compared to the &quot;Hamon&quot; from the prequel. however the stands never evolve or learn in any way. And up to episode 12 every single fight seemed more like a filler that was just there to slow down the plot. normally these fights are present to make our protagonist stronger so they are ultimately ready to face the end villain of the show. but our protagonist Jotaro does not get stronger. not until he actually battle&#039;s Dio in the final match of the show. which means I can watch the first 2 episodes of this show, and the last 2 episodes. and I would have missed NOTHING. that is a such a major flaw I can simply not overlook.<br />
<br />
Now on to a more positive note.<br />
unlike the prequel Stardust crusaders clearly consists of a team.<br />
The biggest flaw of shows like DBZ (especially it&#039;s movies) is that the fights center around 1 brickhouse of a character and the rest of the cast are just water melons waiting to be splattered open by a hammer. Aside from Joesph Joestar the protagonist of the last series our main casts importance is very well devided. despite Jotaro being our Hero, he is not alway&#039;s the hero of each episode. and I approve of this a lot!<br />
<br />
Also I have to address that the Exposition level has GREATLY decreased from the original show. And while this had a comedic aspect Stardust Crusaders feels at least a bit more mature then it&#039;s predecessor. But that does not mean it&#039;s by any means better. Stardust Crusaders just doesn&#039;t intrigue me as much as the original no matter how much I&#039;m looking forward to Jotaro and Dio duking it out with Star Platinum and The World.

    (I&#039;ve read parts 1-8 &amp; seen everything JoJo anime related)<br />
<br />
Stardust Crusaders is the third part of the JoJo series so please watch parts 1 &amp; 2 first. After the events of Phantom Blood &amp; Battle Tendency, Jotaro Kujo makes his debut as this arc&#039;s Joestar who discovers his new STAND power &amp; his visited by his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, warning him of the danger that is DIO Brando. After Jotaro&#039;s mom, Holly Joestar, is taken ill by DIO&#039;s curse, Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff &amp; Iggy embark on a road trip to Egypt to put an end to this family feud of The Joestars &amp;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143393">
        The Brandos.<br />
<br />
Part 3 is the most hyped arc of the series but new fans should be prepared for certain changes. The RIPPLE martial art is no longer in use &amp; is replaced with the series iconic STAND which later inspired Persona. Stardust Crusaders takes advantage of this road trip setting as it pays homages to several horror elements found throughout films &amp; novels, yet this is also its weak point.<br />
<br />
As great as the main cast is, the enemies are perhaps too many for this arc. What is to be expected of part 3 are ongoing fights &amp; villain of the week almost on a constant basis with DIO as the final boss. There are a few villains who leave an impression such as Vanilla Ice &amp; The Darby Bros, but as a whole the villains aren&#039;t Pillar Men level in terms of character. While the future parts of JoJo also follow this formula, it&#039;s more noticeable &amp; repetitive in Part 3.<br />
<br />
However, the charm of Stardust Crusaders are the stands &amp; the heroes themselves as this is the most iconic &amp; arguably the best roster of any JoJo part. While fans may have different opinions on JoJo as a whole, there will undeniably be a favorite character to be found within the group.<br />
<br />
This adaptation of JoJo has achieved greater animation than its previous animes &amp; managed to contain a cinematic &amp; suspenseful tone just like the previous OVAs. Time will tell how Stardust Crusaders will be received within the anime community, but until then dive into JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure where manly shonen heroes battle against the horrors found within Araki&#039;s creative mind. Stardust Crusaders became the main style of later JoJo parts &amp; offers a grand conclusion to its long lasting nemesis &amp; puts the Joestar family curse to rest.<br />
<br />
Enjoy Part 3 &amp; look forward to Part 4 Diamond Is Unbreakable as it may be the last of a masculine artstyle before things get FABULOUS!!

    Finally a show about man on man, like the old days! Jojos Bazaar Adventures: Stardust Crusaders will surprise you right from the start because it doesn&#039;t take place in a store or in space like youd be thinking from the name! Nope, this show is all about tongue in exploding chiek action and adventure! <br />
<br />
The story hooks you at the start, with our protogonist getting in trouble and having to get saved by his grandpa, but he&#039;s not on a creepy school principle&#039;s lap. He&#039;s in jail trying to control a demon! Except it&#039;s not a creepy school principle demon, either, it&#039;s a Stand! No,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146827">
        not like a creepy school principle stand he does when you&#039;re on your knees, this Stand is an invincible fighting guardian! His grandpa reveals that the stand must be used to defeat an ancient evil from their family&#039;s past, else they&#039;ll never be free, and so a grand adventure begins, and let me teel you, they go everywhere:<br />
<br />
India, Japan, Chinese, Ocean, Singerpore, boy you will learn a lot, and have fun doing it because the action is great, the characters are funny, and it never takes itself too serious like a show such as Attack on Tits. This show moves fast, and throws surprises at you faster than a creepy gym teacher. I can&#039;t wait for the episodes where they finally go to space!<br />
<br />
Every Stand fights different, and there&#039;s even one that shines like a rainbow as the characters pose; gay equality for everyone. That&#039;s not to say the drama isn&#039;t good, it&#039;s as sharp as our sharpley dressed as our heroes straight out of The Village Peoples music grupe!<br />
<br />
You will be guessing who is a good guy and who is a bad guy constantly and stands are such an interesting concept since they came out long before Pokeman I am told so. When the guy dies, the stand dies, too, so it adds suspense! It seems like they could almost make a prequel to this show there is so much to explore with it! I wish they did, because we need more shows that have a good one episode man on man.<br />
<br />
Do you like colors? Of course we all love them unless we don&#039;t love colors. Well, this show has colors, and it looks like a comic brought to beutiful life! All the characters look like they work out constantly. I was always how to feel in a scene as the music and art are both so fabulous that they made me want to buy leather chaps.<br />
<br />
Over all, what more can I say, if you like a good, short show that lets it all hang out with stile then go for it, but you have to appreciate that it&#039;s a paredy of itself.<br />

    JOJO&#039;S STARDUST MEISLY CRUSADERS REVIEWED:<br />
<br />
MINDSET:<br />
No utter doubt that this is simply a downgrade in comparison with the first season, and that one was just awesome! So be prepared for a more lack luster plot and worser characters. But is it a mediocrity or dog shat? No!<br />
<br />
SYNOPSIS:<br />
The Joestar family have been fighting the mythical vampire known as “Dio Brando” and soon enough, after he&#039;s death from hundreds of years in wait inside a special box, he somehow manages to finally get out when the box he was trapped was suddenly discovered. We now take place in Japan, after four generations of Joestars from that faithful day

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160237">
        when the first one met Dio, now to carry out the legacy and for the good of the world, Jotaro, the newest member of the Joestar bloodline now has to go thorough a long journey to find where Dio is, and kill him to stop the mayhem of he&#039;s actions. He and he&#039;s grandfather Joeseph coupled with other masculine men, are working together for the same goal.<br />
<br />
REVIEW:<br />
Adimitively, I do actually miss the Hamon thing, the whole show now treats it as if it was some sort of back drop to be abandoned or barely used at all. It was cool to see the new Stand powers, but its not cool to overshadow Hamon completely. And would it not be cool if they used both Hamon and Stands simultaneously?<br />
<br />
Instead of having this easy to follow, yet well executed plot, the biggest difference between Stardust and the first, is mainly that Stardust just loses so much of its appeal on what made it more than just “Pure Action” it aims for this more episodic approach, as each one or two episode mini arcs is basically the enemy first gaining the upper hand, then the gang defeats the enemy after that episode, then they are one step closer to finding Dio, as he is making he&#039;s own stands for people to fight for him as pawns. <br />
<br />
For what Stardust Crusader was worth, it really is just “Pure Action” sure its quite silly at times, and it still has that same JoJo like vibe that we all love with men screaming at the top of there lungs going “OOOHH MY GOOOOD” in one of the funniest engrish I&#039;ve seen since JoJo was the only one who did that whole Engrish thing right! (and maybe Golden Time)<br />
<br />
At the same time, its not doing anything particularly wrong for its own merit, the plot is very simplistic and straight forward for You to get the gist of it and follow, and it just seems to fit right in for being just “Pure Action” and I really feel that this is how all the  tension of the battles eventually fade away, You no longer feel the fact that JoJo and the team are really in danger, its like hey, these guys will eventually make it out alive with the bad guy(s) already killed, because we just want action, not tension or all of the crying Drama BS.<br />
<br />
Characters are simply fun to be around with, sure there are characters like Polnareff with he&#039;s Sister complex being all corny and that, and sure, You definitly do not want to f**k with any of these guys! When I do like to maticulosly judge the characters held persona, what I really see is a bunch of two dimensional fighters. We have Jotaro, the silent type and cool type, Avodol the mentor who teaches all stand users under him, Joseph is no longer that fun, sarcastic, cheeky and feisty man who has the brains of 10 war tacticians, but a much more serious and calm man who is more focused than smiling and screams some Engrish from time to time, and whoever voiced Joeseph&#039;s Engrish, deserves a bronze medal for not actually making it tolerable, but soooo cringe worthy every time I see it.<br />
<br />
Overall, the characters lose what little bit of development they have, nor do they feel like there powers are ever devloping, and its like they can just come up to Dio after Jotaro&#039;s entire gang of super muscular men are all here. Yes, it does get quite repetitive at times and it is not something that I&#039;m a fan off, but again, its not really doing anything wrong if that is what the show initially wanted to accomplish in the first place. However, both action shows are both self-aware on what they are doing and do not fail at it either. Its just that they changed the formats to quite a big difference and one seems better than the other.<br />
<br />
Another thing that I don&#039;t like about Stardust, is that the characters just seem to magically loose there respect to there opponents when they are defeated, like how this stand was defeated and 2 of the group found the stand user was hiding underground breathing on a blow stick then they happily took a wee in it, or how this stand was defeated and one of them found out that the stand user was a baby, when he fed him baby food, he first took his sh*t and mixed it with the food, forcing the baby to eat it. I know, this is supposed to be funny, but I really do not like how Stardust just completely disregards the respect of its death to death battles of the enemy. I would be p!ssed if the first season did that.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, Stardust Crusaders is still “JoJo” the characters may not be as complex or as memorable, but they still somehow manage to fit the whole JoJo-like vibe. The plot might as well be backdrop, but hey, the first season had battles as its most memorable moments ever. The pacing has slowed down since Stardust has been reduced to just “Fighting” but at least it was very self-aware and was never afraid to give You its entertainment.<br />
<br />
David&#039;s getting quite a hit ever since they decided to adapt JoJo into one of the best 80&#039;s remakes ever! (and was approved by Roriconfan for it being better than the original) the newly improved animation just captures the style, self-awareness and the masculinity of the show. Character designs are still JoJo, and I really like the whole super macho men idea fighting to the death. (makes me want to make my own manga about that...) Backgrounds are pretty good all throughout, and the budget remains very consistent and not a dingle moment when I was rather annoyed that it dropped. The action scenes look cool, but there does seem to lack an emphasise on great choreography for the first one, and it sometimes felt that there was not as much thought put in on making these scenes look as cool as I wanted them to be.... Though it is beyond sufficient. The shift into random colours are a nice touch when its used correctly, but nothing worthy for bonus points because its really to stylise the animation.<br />
<br />
The OST is far from bad, it is one of those great variety soundtracks that plays with all sorts of different sounds to create better immersion for each different situation. Of course, I am no music critic, so take these skills into a grain of salt. The sound effects do feel like that excact same thing from the Original, and they seem to fit quite well, but it does&#039;nt have so much impact. (And this is probably the only show that made Engrish sound funny)<br />
<br />
LEGACY:<br />
To a great tale of spoofing the 80&#039;s fighting shounen, has now been reduced to just “Tama want Battle!” is really all what JoJo is now... but if such direction has been decided to really reduce it to that minimalistic state, is it a bad action show? Hell No!<br />
<br />
SCORES:<br />
6/10 - Plot has been reduced to just “Fighting” but at the same time, its not doing anything particularly wrong. <br />
5.5/10 -The characters are less complex, and are quite corny. However, they are still sufficient for being fairly entertaining.<br />
7.5/10 – Consistent animation from David, with great character designs. The action scenes tend to lack great choreography but its still better than average.<br />
6.5/10 – Large variety of music... I&#039;m no music critic, but go take a listen to the OST Yourself. Sorry :/<br />
6/10 - Since it is only entertaining for the action.<br />
<br />
FINALE: 6/10 – FOR ME TO PREDICT THE ENTIRE EPISODIC PLOT.

    JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders is one of the worst anime that has been made (in my opinion) for two main reasons, it is super repetitive and overhyped. For the repetitive part, I usually don&#039;t mind if an anime is repetitive by ARC because at least they add something new. One example is Alabasta Arc and Dressrosa Arc from One Piece. Both have the same formula of story but they have aspects that are unique to each other but here in Trash-I mean JoJo it is repetitive by EPISODE. They will encounter a Stand user that came out of nowhere, without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317502">
        proper build up. The main characters will fight them for 24 minutes, defeat them and that&#039;s it and the show does not even make it interesting. It&#039;s on par with ecchi/romance anime in terms of cringeness. <br />
<br />
Naruto or Bleach fillers are more well written than this. Hametsu no Mars is way more entertaining than this. A generic isekai is way more refreshing than this. The only reason to watch this anime is for the memes. Other than that it is an utter waste of precious time.<br />

    Finally more Jojo!!! Another season of manliness, awesome characters and ridiculous plot. That was what I thought about Stardust Crusaders. Unfortunately the results kinda disappointed me. Let&#039;s start with the story. The plot is certainly ridiculous like the first season but it didn&#039;t have a big progress. Aside from the two first episodes which were very interesting  when the journey starts there isn&#039;t something really unique. It consists by the same structure. Ridiculous situations and the fight of the day that the good guys always win. It was still interesting to see how they would get through every ridiculous situation but  for a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179015">
        point on it became kind off predictable. In the art section the results were godlike. I swear 10 is not even close to describe it. The only thing that I had a problem with was the ridiculous censorship. Yeah there was censorship and that&#039;&#039;s the only reason that I put a 9 in the art. The opening was really awesome almost as manly as the one from the first season and the ending very catchy too. The part that I had a real problem was the characters. In a Jojo adventure I don&#039;t expect character development but the characters here  were disappointing. First of all Kujo was a little bit boring protagonist . But he was still fun. The thing that frustrated me was how Joseph appeared in this anime. Ok I know it takes place 50 years after &#039;&#039;Battle tendency&#039;&#039; and Joseph wouldn&#039;t be as awesome as he used to be but still it was really disappointing to see the ingenious Joseph we knew and love turned into a comic relief. At  least we had some Dio moments but were very few I hope they show him to us more in the next season. Overall I would say that I enjoyed JBA but not nearly as much as the first season. But it was still a fun ride and I can&#039;t wait for more.

    JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is a truly unique show. It&#039;s one of those rare shows that defines its own standard and redraws boundaries of what should and should not be done with aesthetics and fight scenes. The clothes are fabulous, the action is ridiculous, the voice-acting exudes energy, the poses are awe-inspiring, and the soundtrack is a treat for the ears.<br />
<br />
When speaking of other anime you can usually use comparisons to pigeonhole that show into a category, but JoJo is pretty much a category in and of itself. No other show has dialogue like JoJo, a story like JoJo, art style like JoJo, characters like JoJo,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160631">
        or fight scenes like JoJo. Myanimelist lists the show as &quot;shounen&quot;, but JoJo only fits that description in a loose sense.<br />
<br />
JoJo is the embodiment of Kitsch and Camp; a sort of over-the-top silliness that pokes fun at the wider action conventions while simultaneously making fun of itself. It is so ridiculous that instead of eliciting face-palms it instead puts the audience in a state of euphoric enjoyment and delight. This is a show that realizes the inherent lunacy of cultural &quot;manliness&quot;, and then puts it on full display in its comedic glory. <br />
<br />
If JoJo must be categorized then it is the following in descending order: Action + Adventure + Comedy + Fantasy + Horror + Supernatural + Drama.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: 8/10<br />
<br />
The first season of Stardust Crusaders is very much the beginning of the journey. The core gang of Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, and later Polnareff team up together to reach Egypt in order to stop Dio, an old nemesis from the first season of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure. This first part of Stardust is simply put, a long build-up. It ramps up the stakes and the action over the course of the entire season, introducing new Stands and letting the audience get comfortable with the idea of Stands, their limitations (or lack thereof), and building an attachment to the core group of adventurers. <br />
<br />
The pace is significantly slower than the first season of JJBA, much to the rejoicing of manga readers. However, I feel this is a weakness and not a strength. Many minor fights, which serve no consequence, are thrown into the middle arcs of the show. These are nothing more than filler, and can be summed up as: our heroes suspect a stand user, they discover the limitations of the enemy stand, the heroes beat up the stand user, and continue on their journey. It is an effective formula nonetheless, and is a classic one that has been a staple of Asian storytelling since the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. <br />
<br />
The story could have used a bit trimming, however. By staying so true to the manga the story suffers from a bit of unnecessary fluff. Many of the fights are disjointed single-episode throwaways, where the bad guy of the week is beaten to a pulp and nothing of significance or consequence happens. This is the largest problem with Stardust Crusaders in comparison to the first season of JoJo, where filler was nowhere to be seen and every fight served a purpose.<br />
<br />
The biggest addition this season is Stands, which replaces Hamon, as the principal method of combat. Stands are essentially mystical/magical powers that are manifestation of the users&#039; spiritual energy. Their forms are diverse and their application is wildly imaginative and wonderfully realized on screen. <br />
<br />
It is, ultimately, a great adaptation.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART: 9/10<br />
<br />
JoJo is the absolute embodiment of the camp aesthetic. Inspired by Fist of the North Star, 80s fashion, glamrock, and psychedelic rock, JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is a synthesis of color and imagination. The author of JoJo, HIrohiko, once said in an interview that he didn&#039;t think much for realism when he colored, but instead focused on what would look interesting. No other show shares the same color palette as this show. The bright teals and purples are very much an attempt to replicate the coloring of the manga. <br />
<br />
What is immediately clear to any newcomers is the outfits and costuming of this show. While it might be too strange to handle for some, the elaborate and excessive fashion for JoJo only helps to elevate the humor and highlight the oddness of their situation. For such an over-the-top show about magical powers and manly contests of strength, it would be a disservice if their clothing were not over-the-top.<br />
<br />
Another highlight of JoJo is the weirdness of the opponents, the excessive oddness of the Stand powers, and the horror elements. It&#039;s the kind of vibrant entertainment that filled the old pulp sci-fi magazines of the early 20th century.<br />
<br />
I refrain from rating a perfect 10 because JoJo, for all its beauty, has a few moments of choppy animation. It is, after all, difficult to translate such a manga-specific art style to a state of motion. Many characters and fights also lose a bit of detail in transition from the manga, as Araki is known for his laborious and fabulous use of line to accentuate his action scenes. <br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9.9/10<br />
<br />
Stardust Crusaders has a near flawless soundtrack that complements the show perfectly. From the opening ballad to the throwback &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; ED, to the energizing guitar/saxophone combo that shows up every time Jotaro is in a moment of triumph, the OST has it all. Of special note are the perfectly suited  It is by far the best thing about the adaptation that elevates the story to a new level. <br />
<br />
Many adaptations suffer from a problem where they don&#039;t add anything of value to the original manga. They leave the question, &quot;why would I watch this when I could read the manga?&quot; For JoJo I can confidently say that the music is one of the main reasons the show might surpass the source material for some fans. Some tracks such as &quot;Virtuous Pope&quot; and &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot; will have fans fist-pumping and shouting at their screens with joy<br />
<br />
The Japanese voice actors have done an absolutely incredible job. Every character sounds perfect, and is brought to life in the same bombastic fashion as the first season. Of special note are Jotaro&#039;s &quot;ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA&quot; and Joseph&#039;s english &quot;HOLY SHIIIIIITTT!!!&quot; outbursts. As with any great voice work, these voices have now become inseparable from the characters. You can tell the voice actors are having a ton of fun voicing fun material, and their joy is evident in the energy flowing through the entire sound production of this show.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
While the characters are definitely enjoyable, I feel they have yet to spread their wings. There is character development, but it is slow, as it takes a backseat to the fight scenes and other aspects the show has to offer. Jotaro, for better or for worse, is a stoic straight-man who is self-aware of his own coolness. Like many other teens he consciously attempts to be cool, and largely succeeds due to his Stand allowing him to beat the crap out of people while keeping his hands in his pockets. Kakyoin is quirky but hasn&#039;t received too much attention in terms of development, and Avdol is missing for half the season. Polnareff is definitely the standout amongst the new characters, and his demeanor and carefree ways are a delight to watch.<br />
<br />
Joseph Joestar has changed considerably from the previous season. Being saddled with the weakest Stand, he is a great deal less useful in fights. While this is understandable as the focus shifts from Joseph to Jotaro, the difference in Joseph&#039;s personality can be felt for people who loved young Joseph in the previous season.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to Dio yet, as he&#039;s received a maximum of 15 minutes of screen time all season, and his goons are usually one-note cannon fodder for the heroes to chew through. Almost all of the villains are annoying and irredeemable scumbags, for better or for worse. The show adheres to a classic good vs. evil narrative, without spending time dealing with the grays.<br />
<br />
What has not changed from the first season is the sheer delight in the dialogue. Araki has really found a way to make even the most mundane of conversations into something interesting, infusing quirk and wit into every interaction. JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is one of those rare shows that can be enjoyable if you removed all the action and plot and just let these funny characters hang out in a room together.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
<br />
Do you enjoy watching magical powers the likes of which you&#039;ve never seen go up against each other? <br />
<br />
Do you like creepy dolls try to murder a 7 foot tall jacked Frenchman with a towering hairdo? <br />
<br />
Do you enjoy cherries being rolled around in overly athletic tongues?<br />
<br />
Do you like watching heaps of people be murdered in the strangest ways possible?<br />
<br />
Do you love watching manly men do manly things?<br />
<br />
Do you want to watch the scum of the earth receive justice by a million punches?<br />
<br />
Do you like a journey that spans multiple countries, and gives you travel advice?<br />
<br />
Do you enjoy being consistently surprised every single week by a situation you&#039;ve literally never seen in any fiction before?<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never been so entertained.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do a lot of criticizing because I LOVE this show so much. It is my wish that the next season includes more engaging multi-episode fights with consequence (rather than lame single-episode filler fights), as well as a bit more character development. The slower pace is regrettable, since I had enjoyed the relatively speedy pace of the first season. However, it is not so slow as to detract too much from the overall experience.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Stardust Crusaders is a ride to remember and the most fabulous anime to ever grace the screen. It is a unique prismatic gem amongst a sea of dull rocks.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8.8/10

    We&#039;re gonna talk about the most important aspect of the anime, the character designs. The character designs are nothing special, we got the characters in different nationalities, a stereotypical indian/egyptian/whatever, some retired indiana jones wannabe, and a main character that ripped off assets from kenshiro with an edgy twist, everything is in dark bleak and bland colors like we need anymore of those outside of blockbuster puke. Now let&#039;s get to the main point. Right off the bat we are introduced with the characters, and what the series is best known for. For every character whom for some reason gets no explanation whatsoever, they happen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176989">
        to be able to wield super powers! What they basically do is use spirits out of their bodies to fight enemies in their stead and they are called &quot;stands&quot;, hmm where have I seen this before? Oh right, THE FRIGGIN PERSONA SERIES?<br />
<br />
Jesus christ I was facefdesking the desk so hard right when I saw the main character whom have the worst name to exist in a shounen series ever, when he tried too hard trying to be cool and edgy copying the persona 3 characters by shooting a gun in their head, except persona actually have cool characters. Not only that but he curb-stomps every enemy in the anime like they are nothing. Where is the fun in that? Some fight scenes were neat to be fair, ones that actually used strategies rather than pure powerlevel, like that ugh... Jo-J-J-Gaaaaah! I would&#039;ve had like this show better if that awful character didn&#039;t exist since I did not mind the other characters at all despite have almost no substance save for 1 character.<br />
<br />
Just when you thought they couldn&#039;t have ripped off persona even further, all the enemies here have tarot card motifs. WHAT. Yes, it goes all the way from magician to the world cards but here in doesn&#039;t work because the supposed &quot;stands&quot; don&#039;t even have anything to do with the corresponding tarots while in persona, the tarot cards are used to reflect the character&#039;s personality. Might as well use constellation names if they&#039;re going to be relevant if at all.<br />
<br />
In some episodes, we get to see the big bad&#039;s supposed &quot;all according to evil plan&quot; scene, but all he does is sit his ass all day while he dispatches the bad guys to do the dirty work for him, I keep thinking I&#039;m watching a Saturday morning cartoon for some reason! So yes, the whole show is also an episodic one at that and the only plot line is them getting to the big bad, that&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But AzuriteMal&quot;, Stardust Crusaders came out in 1989 while the first persona came out in 1996&quot;. Oh that is simple, let me educate you my dear boy. You see, Persona is part of the megaten series, and megaten came out in 1987, megaten = persona, therefore persona = megaten. What year is that? *gasp* no way, now you know?<br />
<br />
I did kinda like how the title stays true to its name with having a real sense of adventure since they travel from Japan to Egypt and such. Most of the setting are like what I&#039;d imagine them to be so that&#039;s a plus. Music started good like they keep up the tense of the scene, but it got repetitive hearing the same thing over and over again like a JRPG battle theme. Someone said that there will be an epic fight scene in the 2nd season but I&#039;m not holding my breath since I&#039;m not a fan of episodic anime. I got better things to catch up to.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
- Persona series: both are very similar, very dark, better characters, makes you think.<br />
- Berserk: It&#039;s still darker and more gar than this.

    Stardust Crusaders is a wild ride that hybrids a serious story with over the top comedy perfectly.<br />
Actual Score: 9.2<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story is amazing as it follows the Joe stars crossing the world in 80 days battling against stands and their masters in various location with new problems arising with each encounter that feel fresh and new each time while also blending over top comedy that will make you laugh while feeling satisfied with the story with unexpected plot twists without having a complex plot.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The art is amazingly detailed with characters having a great style covered in dark outlines making all characters standout more in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160123">
        good ways and vile ways like seeing gore in that kind of definition will make your stomach feel funny but is all good. Fight scenes are fast-pasted and never slow down with amazing animation that makes all encounters feel original and exciting; and finally the background is outstanding with well detailed areas that feel like the studio did there homework for each location they visit.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The soundtrack is well done and can make any given scene feel uplifting and exciting with well places music that will make your heart race full of various different pieces of music. The opening suits the anime very well with  Jin Hashimoto&#039;s STAND UP as the theme it gets you pumped and ready for another episode of volatile fun; the ending theme was very surprising with it being a Western song that fits the anime well.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
The characters are all very amazing with the main cast having original personalities and different goals for pursuing Dio who doesn&#039;t get much screen time put with any appearance you will wet yourself each time. But the characters truly shine will character stand and master that feel refreshing in each encounter with various goals, personalities and appearances as well as unique stands all with various powers and abilities as well as sometimes amazing personalities. <br />

    JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure part 3: Stardust Crusaders in many ways fully lives up to the part of the title were it says &quot;Adventure&quot;, Part 3 was a rollercoaster, it was emotional, it was fun and it was a great watch. <br />
<br />
Q: Should you watch JoJo Bizarre Adventure part 3: Stardust Crusaders?<br />
<br />
A: Yes. One of the best things about JJBA as a whole is that you can start at any part with little knowledge of the series and still get the fullest out of the experience, SDC is no different, you can jump in and fully immerse your self in the Bizarre world of JoJo&#039;s bizarre

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328331">
        adventure. As for preexisting fans of the series part 3 is completely necessary, it close out what was started in part 1 and is the climax to the Dio Brando vs Joestar battle.<br />
<br />
~Review Portion~<br />
<br />
[story-6/10]<br />
The starts off exactly 100 years after the events of phantom blood, the year is now 1989 and Jotaro Kujo sits in a prison cell, why you may ask? Well, Jotaro has been possessed by a &quot;Evil Spirit&quot;, but Jotaro&#039;s Grandfather and former &quot;JoJo&quot; Joseph Joestar and his Egyptian friend of 2 years Abdul Mohammed tells him that this &quot;Evil spirt&quot;is non other than a &quot;Stand&quot;, Stands are the visual manifestation of life energy, each stand serves a purpose for any situation. Once Jotaro Leaves his prison cell we learn that Dio, after 100 years has resurfaced and is in Cairo Egypt ready to take of the world.<br />
<br />
Part 3 has a sufficient story, a lot of the early portions of the series are pure dragging long and drawn out segments. The first part follows a sort of monster of the week formula, Dio just throws wave after wave of Stand Users at the Crusaders and it gets very very repetitive. They&#039;re also very forgettable characters, mostly they&#039;re One note villains. Fortunately this is made up for with the Egypt Arc, having fun and memorable villains who make for some of the most entertaining battles in the series. <br />
<br />
[Art-9/10]<br />
The team over at David Productions did a great job of capturing Araki&#039;s distinct over the top macho and bravado very well. The animation is pretty good, it can look very static but overall is good.<br />
<br />
[Sound-10/10]<br />
The sound is great, the two openings &#039;Stand Proud&quot; and &quot;Sono Chio Kioku&quot; are fantastic, filled with subtle metaphors, good animation, and have unique style to them. The two endings &quot;Walk like an Egyptian&#039;&#039; which is a great Bangles song and a classic &#039;Last Train Home&quot; a Pat Metheny Classic, both are fun and have a great and novel style to them. The VA work was absolutely PHENOMENAL! It was amazing, some of the best voice acing I have ever seen, the voices for Dio (Takehito Koyasu) and Jotaro Kujo ( Daisuke Ono) were brilliant, of course the voice for old Joseph (Ishizuka Unshou) best known for playing Jet from Cowboy Bebop (Also R.I.P you will be missed) was great, alongside the performance&#039;s given for the rest of the crusaders and the many side villains.<br />
<br />
[Character-8/10]<br />
The main cast was highly enjoyable but suffered from a lack of characterisation, characters like Abdul who are great but bland and is lacking in scrrentime, Kakyoin who is good and has great depth but is lacking in screen Time in the Egypt arc, Joseph who is still the best character, alongside Polnareff, who both steal the show whenever there on screen, Iggy is under utilised as he is only there for the Egypt arc is bland but enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Jotaro himself is considered by a lot of people to be the worst JoJo for being too &quot;Cool&quot; and not having any real personality, I find Jotaro to be a great character who is much deeper than how he appears, he has a lot of great fights and is very enjoyable. Dio makes a return as he is the primary antagonist of the series and is even more menacing than ever, his presence makes the deaths so much sadder and the fights even more epic, he is also fun, and is a calm figure who becomes twisted into this psychopath. There are many Side villains in part 3, the D&#039;Arby Brothers are both great, Milder is hot and has one of the best stands in SDC, pet shop has one of the best fights in the part and most of the villains in the Egypt arc are good, unfortunately the villains in the first half are mainly bland and forgettable with the exception of maybe Enyaba, Steely Dan and Hol Horse.<br />
<br />
[enjoyment-10/10]<br />
I really enjoyed SDC, it&#039;s not the most fun part In the series but it&#039;s a highly enjoyable piece of media, it has good action beats, great fights and is fun to watch throughout the whole series.<br />
<br />
[overall-9/10]<br />
JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders is a great watch, it has a lot of new interesting ideas, introducing stands for example, it has got a lot in store for prior fans but has a lot to give for new comers and is a great anime.<br />

    I was so disappointed in this sequel to the first couple arcs I felt compelled to write a review.  It would have gotten a few more points if it wasn&#039;t totally overshadowed by it&#039;s predecessor.  So let&#039;s go make a list of reasons why this is a total disappointment.<br />
<br />
Reason 1:  Concept.  For some reason, they went in a totally different direction of the established universe and decided to make it some kind of manly Digimon-type anime.  Not as cool as it sounds.  Remember those cool martial arts fights with Ripple energy?  Yeah, that&#039;s essentially gone.<br />
<br />
Reason 2:  The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279956">
        characters.  No depth at all.  And you might be thinking, &quot;but it&#039;s one of those manly type animes, they don&#039;t have to be deep.&quot;  Watch some Fist of the North Star.  Hell, watch the prequel to this piece of crap again.  There might of been two or three scenes in an entire 24 episodes that gave me some kind of investment or feeling towards the characters.  Additionally, Joseph Joestar.  While I thought he wasn&#039;t as cool as Jonathan, he was pretty damn cool and actually had a personality.  Not to mention he had wile and guile in spades enough so to defeat nearly omniscient beings that had lived for over a millennia.   He makes a return as a grandpappy in this season and apparently old age has addled his brains because he&#039;s more often that not a liability the whole show.  The only thing I ever had to look forward to from Joseph was his comic relief shticks of screaming &quot;OH NO,&quot; &quot;OH SHIT,&quot; and &quot;OH MY GOD,&quot; in English which is probably the most enjoyable part of this show.<br />
<br />
Reason 3:  Length.  They drag this shit out so far.  Let&#039;s compare.  Prequel, they essentially go through two story arcs and 2 generations of Joestars in the same number of episodes.  This show, they got to Egypt.  IT&#039;S HALF A FUCKING STORY ARC.  I was so hopeful.  I enjoyed the prequel so much that I struggled to get through this.  I&#039;m like, &quot;it&#039;s okay, this happens.  I&#039;ll just get through this and next season will be better, I&#039;m sure of it.&quot;  Imagine my growing sense of dread as I come to realize that the next season is more of this.  But you know what, I&#039;m going to watch it anyway because I liked the first installment so much.  I&#039;m really going to try and see where this goes.<br />
<br />
I could keep going but those are my main complaints without going off on tangents about every little thing.  Plus my disappointment has drained me so I&#039;m going to get ready to steel myself and begin the next half of this travesty.  Good luck to us all.

    If Gurren Lagann put hair on my lip, Jojo put hair on my chest, turned me into The Arnold (ca 1986), and made me sound like James Earl Jones. <br />
If you want to become a real man, this shouty shonen is the one for you. <br />

Overview: <br />
Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventures: Stardust Crusaders (from now on referred to as Jojo) is part 3 in the over the top, super macho tale of ultra-burly men of the Joestar family who all go by the moniker Jojo. They battle the supernatural forces of darkness, sent by the fabulously evil DIO, and chaotic action, weirdness, and hilarity ensue. Hamon has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181339">
        been ditched in favor of these new superpowers called &quot;Stands&quot; which are based on tarot cards. The user has powers which &#039;suggest&#039; an association with a card, and are named thusly. The powers range from human to animal transformation, combat spectres, fog, dream eaters, and even the sun, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. <br />
<br />
Tha Basics:<br />
<br />
Art: 8 <br />
<br />
That signature Jojo comic-book-come-to-life style art is once again put to excellent use in Stardust Crusaders, as it was in the previous iteration of Jojo. Combining trippy psychedelic still frame and pans complete with a swirling miasma of neon yellow, blue, green, and purple lights, flowers, zigzags, polka dots, inverted colors, and other filters takes you on a visual Trip At The Brain. This Jojo goes through a variety of settings, as part of the theme is travelling around the world. Consistently drawn characters, well animated fight scenes, and some gruesome blood and gore effects made it a blast to watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 9 (5 for OP/ED/BGM, 4 for VA)<br />
<br />
The OP is a high octane made-for-Jojo track called &quot;Stand Proud&quot; by Jin Hashimoto. A good song to get pumped up for the GARness to come. Man, this series could have made use of some Suicidal Tendencies, but I&#039;ll take The Bangles and &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot; for the ending. A fitting song, given all the 80s pop and rock references that makes this show so fun, not to mention the whole &quot;Journey to Egypt&quot; plot.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting is very good. Joseph Joestar and Polnareff are the most interesting and animated characters. Full of great one liners and engrish cursing, they&#039;re always good for a laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 9 (Can i give this a 10 just for Joseph Joestar?)(8.8 Joseph Joestar, 0.2 everyone else, haha)<br />
<br />
We&#039;ve got 5 mains in this show: Old man Joseph Joestar, our hero from the previous installment of Jojo, Battle Tendency, once again takes up the reins as a 67 year old to once again lead his merry band of burly men on a hunt for the nefarious DIO, and picks up a couple friends along the way. He really gets a chance to shine in this series, with his &quot;OHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH&quot; and &quot;OH NOOOO&quot; one liners, along with some classic Joseph &quot;and now you&#039;ll ....&quot; and the famous Joestar family secret technique. While providing a lot of the wacky humor the show is known for, he doesn&#039;t take a back seat just because he&#039;s old. He is still able to kick a lot of ass, and does it with style.<br />
<br />
Avdol, an Egyptian fortune teller and magician friend of Joseph&#039;s. Not a whole lot to say about him; he&#039;s typically the most moderate and cool headed voice of reason in the group. He provides a lot of information about and names the Stands that the group has, along with those of their enemies.<br />
<br />
Jotaro Kujo is the new Jojo for part 3. Jotaro, despite his steely and cold straight man demeanor (and penchant for extreme violence, which leads to some awesome payoffs later in the show) actually has a little depth to his character. I feel like he&#039;ll be fleshed out a lot more in Stardust Crusaders 2, but I have to go on what I&#039;ve seen here: He&#039;s kind of boring. He&#039;s extremely stoic, unshakable, and generally exudes the air of &quot;don&#039;t f** with me&quot;. They try to give him a little more characterization though asides of his family members speaking about his personality, but these don&#039;t shine through very often in the show. However, this isn&#039;t really what the show is about, that intense characterization.. it&#039;s about KICKING ASS! and Jotaro delivers with gusto! ORAORAORAORAORAORAORA<br />
<br />
Kakyoin is next up: a schoolmate of Jotaro&#039;s and fellow stand user. He&#039;s typically calm and reserved, but knows to step up when necessary. Level headed and a strategist, Kakyoin is a solid member of the team. He also typically serves as a foil to our last guy--<br />
<br />
--Polnareff. A fabulous Frenchman with a wild flat top and a body that&#039;d make Broly jealous. Impulsive, goofy, and hot tempered, Polnareff serves as the comedic relief most of the time, his temper getting him into a lot of very compromising situations, including one riotously funny one involving a bathroom. He gets a lot of heavy characterization in the latter half of the show, and we find out about his past, his inner demons, and what he&#039;s fighting for. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 5 (Mediocre by MAL rating)<br />
<br />
This is my main problem with Stardust Crusaders: the new pace. I&#039;m all for taking some time and slowing a plot down when there&#039;s a lot that&#039;s got to be covered. Some other shows could have benefited from more than a 23-26 episode arc instead of 12 or 13, but whatever. The previous Jojo parts were 9 and 17 episodes each (Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency respectively), or essentially each a 1 cour show, and now Stardust Crusaders is getting FOUR whole seasons to itself.. <br />
The plot, &quot;benefiting&quot; from this extended length essentially boils down into an episodic &quot;bad guy of the week&quot; format (a la Pokemon) for the first 14 episodes, and then a bad guy every two weeks from then on. Beyond episode 16, it was much improved, with more interesting villains and funnier situations, but the middle run of it almost turned into a bit of a chore to watch. They stretched what would have been about 10 episodes of content into two seasons, basically.<br />
It could have been cleared up much quicker with a montage or quick, funny two to four minute blurb about how they defeated all these useless villains. This would have enabled a more significant plot arc to develop, and a chance for DIO to be worked into the show. For such a great villain, he barely gets any on screen time, which is a shame for a show that prides itself on having over the top craziness onscreen 90% of the time. Some may counter this rating by saying that it focuses on the characters more by slowing it down, but I feel that for as much characterization as we got, it would have have to have been a literary analysis level study of in depth, emotional complexities and motivations to get much deeper. Jojo isn&#039;t about that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7 (80s bands references 4, brutal shonen action 1, characters 2)<br />
<br />
Jojo has been growing on me. I didn&#039;t want to like the 2012 iteration, but Joseph redeemed it for me during Part 2. Stardust Crusaders gave me more of what I wanted from Jojo: over the top, mature shonen action with the signature flair for the dramatic and 80s pop and classic rock references. It got bogged down in the middle with the baddie of the week setup, but the last few episodes were great. The anticlimactic battle with the Empress, the dreamland battle with Death, and the strangely introspective Judgement episode was also a standout. A stocked second half, and more Joseph.. that&#039;s what made the season great.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
I really wanted to rate this show higher, because it improved on some parts of Jojo 2012, kept me entertained, and gave me something fun to watch. At the same time though, it left me hanging on actually accomplishing what the show set out to do, and that&#039;s why I can&#039;t give it an 8. <br />
<br />
<br />
tl;dr<br />
+wacky, goofy, laugh out loud moments<br />
+Joseph Joestar<br />
+brutal action (despite censors)<br />
+80s jokes<br />
+good animation<br />
<br />
+/- slower pacing<br />
+/- little character development<br />
<br />
- more villains than ever before, now with less significance! <br />
- middle segment is a little boring<br />
<br />
<br />
Recommend?<br />
If you like Jojo, it&#039;s exactly what you&#039;re expecting, and more of what you want. If you&#039;re looking to get into Jojo, start with the 2012 reboot and decide from there. <br />

    We see jotaro is the best jojos. From history I have nothing more to add.<br />
No lie, this part of the arc is full of fights too many for my liking. It becomes very, very repetitive whenever they get close to the goal, something happens again that delays them like that until the end of the season. For better or for worse that is the season if you have patience for it you will enjoy it a lot because what is coming in the second part is glorious. The group of characters that is put together is very epic, although they always beat the Frenchman too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408523">
        much. I think he is the character with the most identified, he tries to be a good person and go out with girls but everything goes wrong. The animation is very good, always very regular that I like to maintain a very good level is always appreciated. I highly recommend it so I hope you see it. Be patient with this season it may be a bit dense but what is coming is epic.<br />
<br />
En español:<br />
Vemos jotaro es el mejor jojos. De la historia no tengo mas que agregar. <br />
No mentira, esta parte del arco este llenas de peleas demasiadas para mi gusto. Se vuelve muy pero muy repetitivo siempre que se acercan al objetivo v8uelve a pasar algo que los atrasa así hasta el final de la temporada. Para bien o para mal eso es la temporada si le tenes paciencia lo vas a disfrutar un montón porque lo que se vienen en la segunda parte es glorioso. El grupo de personajes que se arma es muy épico aunque siempre lo golpean demasiado al francés creo que es el personaje con el mas identifico trata de ser buena persona y salir con chicas pero todo le sale mal. La animación muy buena, siempre muy regular eso me gusta mantienen un nivel muy bueno siempre se agradece. La recomiendo un montón así que espero que la vean. Tengan paciencia con esta temporada puede ser un poco densa pero lo que se viene es épico.

    Jojo truly is a good anime. I&#039;ll tell you the reasons why:<br />
<br />
1. The story is very astonishing.<br />
<br />
The story plot isn&#039;t just a normal story plot, it&#039;s very well planned. It gives you the hype feels. The story plot also doesn&#039;t &quot; fly-off &quot; ( it means that the story plot stays on track, it only focuses on... on the story! ).<br />
<br />
2. The art is very creative.<br />
<br />
Some anime studio use the same technique in drawing Anime characters;<br />
Thin lips<br />
Big eyes ( not all studios use this technique tho )<br />
Thin body ( sometimes the male characters has some STICK like shape )<br />
<br />
But the characters in JoJo however, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395941">
        very, very, DETAILED.<br />
You can literally see the detail of the lips,  the boldness and &quot; roughness &quot; of the eyes, the muscles and the lines of the arms and legs. It&#039;s really creative and original.<br />
<br />
3. The sounds and music used are very well made.<br />
<br />
For example;<br />
<br />
The normal punch barrage sound sounds like, well, punch sounds, the typical *psch* *psch* *psch* sound. But the punching sound of [ SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! ] Star Platinum sounds like a FREAKING SHOTGUN! ( yep! not punching sounds, but SHOTGUN BLASTS! ). The Sword-slashing sound of Polnareff&#039;s Stand is really, REALLY wobbly! <br />
<br />
Welp, that&#039;s my review! I hoped you enjoyed it! :&gt;

    To kick it off. I am going to say. yes. Do watch it. Even if you&#039;re considering starting with part 3 like a filthy casual. Which is... <br />
S u r e   b e   l i k e   t h a t .<br />
<br />
Story is a *SOLID* 4 out of 10 at medium capacity, I could easily push for 6 but nah.<br />
<br />
Art is just as any other jojo part a straight up 11/10<br />
<br />
Sound. Wait what? why is sound a thing? what? Music is good as always. But the sound of my cheeks clapping down the hallway shouldn&#039;t be something I need

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395236">
        to rate, right? dunno man gotta put this low, like, 7 of 10 or something?<br />
<br />
character? Other than being smexy as fook they don&#039;t have a lot going for them. there&#039;s good guys, bad guys and... hol&#039;up the horse? at best it might be like somewhere in the 6-7 range at lowest it&#039;s &quot;Hi I am a gambler&quot; which is of course a solid 10. Gotta put it somewhere in between so I&#039;m thinking a 5.5 so I put it at 5<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is of course a 1. plus 9 more because it&#039;s fun.<br />
WHAT? WERE YOU EXPECTING MORE? I&#039;M DOING THIS FOR FREE!<br />
<br />
overall a 10/10. Now you might be sitting there on your ass  or someone else&#039;s I&#039;m not judging. asking yourself or them. Again, not judging. &quot;How is it a 10/10 if half the scores are less than 3. You&#039;re wrong, learn to count, the scores are less than 5 actually. But I say it&#039;s so Iconic and vital for the rest of jojo I have to rank it this high or Araki senpai will not notice me. Can&#039;t write spoilers but hol the horse is

    I&#039;ll start this review for Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders by saying i have not seen the other Jojo seasons or read the manga volumes ether and had absolute zero clue what it was going to be about, I know that&#039;s stupid of me but i still enjoyed it.<br />
this review may contain spoilers but i&#039;ll try my best not to spoil too much.<br />
<br />
Story  8/10<br />
<br />
The story centers around Jotaro Kujo, a badass 17 year old delinquent (who look like he&#039;s a 23 year old) who is possessed by an &#039;evil spirit&#039; so he keeps himself imprisoned to avoid any casualties, he is then visited by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160235">
        his mother and grandfather, Joseph Joestar (who looks like everything Indiana Jones should of been) and Joseph&#039;s good friend Avdol. Joseph explains that the &#039;evil spirit&#039; is called a &#039;Stand&#039;, monsters that can take any form (such as a flaming bird, a knight in armor or even a micro sized parasite) who give their masters a big boost in power, anyway Jotaro&#039;s mother suddenly gains a Stand but causes her to get severely ill and the cause of this is the awakening of Dio (the antagonist) who i believe was on the previous Jojo season i really don&#039;t know much about him sorry. The gang set out for Egypt to find and defeat Dio, they meet friends on the way and fight really BIZARRE people also this is only part 1 it stops as soon as they get to Egypt so the ending is pretty ... meh ...<br />
<br />
Art  9/10<br />
<br />
I loved the art style to this anime its very comicy.. if thats a style... or a word..  it was unique and brand new to me i&#039;ve never seen any other with a similar art style like it and was perfect for the anime. (Almost)<br />
<br />
Sound  7/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know what to review for the sound, the sound was.. just... yeah.. but the opening ost was good to listen to and i couldn&#039;t help but laugh at the song &#039;Walk like an Egyptian&#039; which is the ending ost. Seriously the last song i thought they would play for a japanese anime.<br />
<br />
Character  7/10<br />
<br />
The seasons group Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin and Polnareff were... interesting each with unique personalities. This anime doesn&#039;t show much development like training to gain more strength it was just &quot;I&#039;m a villain here to kill you&quot; a fight starts then Jotaro repeatedly punches their face into submission or something along those lines. You only see Dio a few times forever alone in his playboy mansion sending freaks to kill Jotaro and others and thats about the only air time for Dio. Poor guy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment  9/10<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed Stardust Crusaders the fight scenes were good to watch some were more like ass whippings than fights and of course the out of it comedy were good for a laugh or two.<br />
But there were scenes i was confused about like how the characters are harmed (Stabbed, shot or even have their ankle sliced off or half-way through getting eaten alive) they just dust themselves off and move on. <br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall i thought this was a very good anime to watch, basic story, great art, good op and ed osts to listen to, the character development may need work, enjoyable battle scenes. I would recommend this to people who love shounen or battle anime or just an anime with muscular men fighting.
