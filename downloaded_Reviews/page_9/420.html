    There&#039;s a certain finesse in the way all the characters in this anime have to prove themselves at their favorite sport. Overall, characters psychology and in-game tension is here one of the best you could find in an anime sport, but that&#039;s it : for the rest, this anime is way deserved by a pitiful story, pretty much non-existent, and full useless and unbearable flashbacks to know more about characters that will STILL lose at the end (most of the time). You want something original and crazy ? Go for One Outs, that&#039;s way better.

    This was my first venture into the sports anime genre, and DnA just sucked me into it like a black hole. I&#039;ve never watched a single baseball game in my life and I&#039;ve never showed any interest in the sport. I honestly thought that I wouldn&#039;t like this show, but if it&#039;s good enough to get approved for 52 episodes in its first season (and the fact that it was being produced by Madhouse), I thought I&#039;d give it a try. I can honestly say that DnA has become one of my all-time favourite shows.<br />
<br />
The story (10/10) is pretty straightforward: we follow Sawamura&#039;s journey as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152901">
        a pitcher as he grows and develops his skills in order to become the ace of Seidou&#039;s (famous) high school baseball team. But the show provides us more than just following Sawamura&#039;s journey; we basically get an overall glimpse of how high school baseball in Japan. The show definitely takes its time to progress, and we don&#039;t really see Sawamura beginning to grow until we&#039;re about 12 or so episodes in. But, in the episodes before that we see exactly why it took him a while and how hard he&#039;s worked up till then; we also get to see a pretty touching relationship develop between him and his future mentor.<br />
<br />
Though I initially did get the feel that Sawamura is the absolute MC, as the story progressed and more characters were introduced, there was a slight focus shift where Sawamura was undoubtedly still the MC, but the other Seidou team members were also just as important.<br />
<br />
One thing that the story always provides and excels at is: SUSPENSE. DnA knows hows to build up suspense leading up to the final scene in every episode, especially in the later episodes when they&#039;re in the Koshien qualifying matches.<br />
<br />
The art (8/10) to be honest, didn&#039;t really sit well with me in the first episode (and only the first episode; I know, shame on me for judging a show based only one episode). But now, I don&#039;t even remember the reason I didn&#039;t like it. I re-watched episode 1 and I can only conclude that maybe it was because I wasn&#039;t expecting the show to be great and the relatively slow start of that episode that caused me not to like the art immediately. Overall, no complaints; the only reason it didn&#039;t get a higher score was because I&#039;ve been spoilt with unique and or eye-popping art styles lately (Haikyuu! being the best) and can&#039;t help but compare them.<br />
<br />
The baseball-playing scenes are very well-done especially some of the pitches which are animated showing clear movement of the ball (slow-mo shots of how the ball moves, or a clear arrow-like streak of light to see the course of the ball). Especially Sawamura&#039;s unique pitching form is well done. I never tire of seeing it. In later episodes, we also get to see how genius of a catcher Miyuki is with a few amazing saves.<br />
<br />
Because comedy is a big part of this show, sometimes we&#039;ll see chibi forms pop out now and then, or sudden solid-colored background changes (with sfx and the like) when the mood switches suddenly from serious to funny.<br />
<br />
Overall, the animation gives off a very shounen-like vibe: we get to see red-colored and blue-colored demon eyes for when they&#039;re fired up, players aura engulfing their bodies like a flame when they&#039;re pumped up, etc.<br />
<br />
And now onto the TWO PARTS that truly make DnA the great show that it is, the show&#039;s soundtrack (and sound effects) and its impressive cast of characters.<br />
<br />
The SOUND (10/10) of this show is just... flawless (swoon). Madhouse somehow just knows how to perfectly fit the background music to whichever scene comes up which in turn really made me feel the intensity/emotion every scene: whoever came up with the score deserves an award (if he&#039;s not already gotten one).<br />
<br />
And the sound effects give me the chills every time: the ball hitting the mitt with a resounding BAM! (or when Furuya throws it&#039;s more like thunder splitting open a tree), the sound of the metal bat hitting the ball (or when Raiichi hits it, more like canon fire) vs the sound of Haruichi&#039;s wooden bat hitting the ball, etc.<br />
<br />
The voice actors did (and still do) an amazing job; their voices fit the characters perfectly. If you check out their impressive resumes, it&#039;s definitely no wonder.<br />
<br />
As for the OPs and ED&#039;s:<br />
Both OP&#039;s so far are by the same artist, and they&#039;re really good (and revved me right up); though I&#039;m enjoying the 2nd OP more; I can&#039;t help but shout &quot;Fight!&quot; as well every time I hear it, putting me in Seidou-cheering mood.<br />
The ED&#039;s have also been good, though not as good as the OP&#039;s. The 4th ED, which is sung collectively by 3 of the 4 main cast members, is a really nice tune.<br />
<br />
The CHARACTERS (10/10) are all loveable and memorable. Though we have the main cast consisting of 4 people, the supporting cast is nothing to sneeze at.<br />
<br />
Sawamura is the loud, cheerful, wears his heart on his sleeve kind of guy. So what kind of quirk does he have that makes him the MC? He&#039;s a southpaw (left-handed) pitcher and has a peculiar pitch (both of which make him a unique type of player). But, even though he&#039;s unique he isn&#039;t the type of MC that&#039;s super-talented right from the start, he doesn&#039;t suddenly &quot;power up&quot; in the middle of a game, is unstoppable and wins all the matches; on the contrary, he gets into Seidou and quickly realises it&#039;s not as easy as he thought to become the ace because there are other people there who are more skilled than him. He falters during important moments, and even if he doesn&#039;t get back up immediately, he does eventually pick himself up and learns to move on. In other words, he accepts that he has a lot of faults, and this is what makes him so likeable and seem more human. Though a bit of an idiot (well, a big idiot), he works hard, values friendship, supports the team and always puts 120% in everything that he does. And the best part for me, he&#039;s unpredictable. Just when you think he&#039;s turning the corner and well on his way to becoming the ace, he messes up a play or does something really silly. I&#039;m always on edge with him.<br />
<br />
Miyuki, the genius catcher, is personality-wise, almost the exact opposite of Sawamura, except for the cheerful part. He&#039;s as crafty and intelligent as they come and though on the outside he&#039;s always smiling, he has a bit of a dark side. He&#039;s like the evil genius.<br />
<br />
Furuya is our MC&#039;s rival for the ace spot. At first glance, he looks like the cool and collected type of person, also; but after a while I found him to be an adorable idiot as well: not being able to catch a simple throw and his insta-snooze reaction amongst others.<br />
<br />
Last but not least of our main cast quartet, is Haruichi. Character-design wise, he&#039;s the cutest one. And though he might be cute, he&#039;s one amazing baseball player: not only is he a batting prodigy, but an exceptional fielder as well. At the same time, he&#039;s so humble and shy. Cuteness overload!<br />
<br />
And then we have the other Seidou members, who all play an important role in the show. All have distinctive and quirky personalties and you will grow attached to at least one after watching DnA.<br />
<br />
As far as enjoyment (10/10) goes, I am thoroughly enjoying watching every second of DnA. Whenever I watch it, i can always expect a good dose of humour interlaced with the appropriate amount of emotional moments and also a killer cliff-hanger. I wait eagerly for Saturdays to roll around and every time I finish watching the latest episode, I want to jump out the window because it&#039;s going to take another week before I can watch the show again.<br />
<br />
Overall (9.6/10) I would recommend anyone to start watching DnA immediately, even if you&#039;ve never seen a baseball match before, even if you know absolutely nothing about the game (but after watching the show, I got so curious I even googled basic baseball rules, pitch types and the structure of Japanese high school baseball tournaments). And I envy you if you haven&#039;t watched it yet, because you&#039;ll be able to marathon the show, so you don&#039;t have to get as frustrated as me with those cliffhangers. :)

    Diamond no Ace isn&#039;t completed at the time of this review, but I wanted to write a positive review on the anime so maybe more people would watch it. Diamond no Ace is one of the most enjoyable anime I&#039;ve ever seen. Of course you must be wondering how watching an anime about baseball could possibly be so enjoyable. I&#039;m not much of a baseball fan or sports fan for that matter myself, but Diamond no Ace succeeds in drawing the viewers into all the excitement of the sport with all it&#039;s dramatized action. <br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t anything unique or original. The plot is basically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163181">
        the same as any other sports anime: the main character, who starts off with almost nothing, journeys to become a great player who eventually wins the trust of his teammates and fights to win a championship. Of course along the way he must endure and go through lots of hardships, obstacles and as hard as it may be, develop friendships with his other teammates. That main character in Diamond no Ace&#039;s story would be Eijun Sawamura, a pitcher who attends Seido, an elite baseball school. Eijun is a hard-working, determined boy who used to play baseball because he wanted to have fun with his friends, but as the plot develops, he plays baseball in order to become the ace pitcher of his school&#039;s team, and become a winner. To add onto the sports aspect of the anime, the plot also takes place in school for a lot of times (some real comedy relief from the seriousness of the baseball matches). The development of friendship between teammates/friends, and rivalries between opponents were masterfully done. The suspense build-up and excitement in the baseball matches were quite shocking to me, because I didn&#039;t expect baseball to seem so epic and entertaining. <br />
<br />
Personally I think that the biggest strength of Diamond no Ace is the variety of interesting characters and how much time is being spent developing the characters aside from the main character, Eijun Sawamura. Eijun, despite being the focal point of the plot, almost feels like a vessel through which the viewer can see and interact with the other side characters. Because the sport of baseball makes it necessary for a lot of characters, there are a lot of characters. But almost none of the side characters are shown just for a gimpse in an episode, then to be found nowhere the next episode. All the characters have some kind of development and unique trait to them that makes them all memorable. I could discuss in detail about 10 other characters in the anime, but since that&#039;d take too long, I&#039;ll mention just one other character: Satoru Furuya, who is Eijun&#039;s rival for the &quot;Ace Pitcher&quot; spot on the team. He&#039;s very bad at communicating/getting along with other people, and is keeps to himself for the most part. It&#039;s revealed in his past that he never got along and was never accepted by his teammates, but on Seido, he finally does get acceptance by his teammates, leading him to show a tiny bit more emotion. His passion for baseball and determination matches that of Eijun, and so their rivalry for the ace pitcher position takes root, but they also seem to development a friendship and sort of respect/understanding for each other. Diamond no Ace&#039;s use of characters is easily a 10/10. <br />
<br />
The music and art in the anime were definitely good. The openings for Diamond no Ace set the exciting tone to come in the anime. The other soundtracks used during the baseball matches managed to amplify the suspense in each moment. The sound of each hit was looouuuudd!! But that also added suspense. The art in the anime was very bright, colorful, and clear; the art that I like. The baseball matches were drawn to near perfection. The characters were all distinctively drawn. The voice acting was superbly done; it must have been hard for them to be yelling all the time. <br />
<br />
My enjoyment aspect of the anime was &quot;high&quot;. Before watching this anime, I didn&#039;t expect much, I just watched it because it was on the recommendations list for Haikyuu, one of my favorite anime. But, I was to be surprised to say the least. Diamond no Ace switched around from school-life friendships to off the field issues, to the fantastic baseball matches, never failing to keep me interested. I&#039;d tell all sports-lovers to watch Diamond no Ace, and I&#039;d recommend anyone else to give Diamond no Ace a shot (maybe first 10 episodes), because it&#039;s definitely an anime worth giving a chance. Hehe, thanks for reading and I hope you do give Diamond no Ace a watch!

    I have never written a review before, nor had I planned to. And I really dont care how un-review-like this review may be. I had to do it. I had to make an exception, just for this series, because I don not think that this series has got the credit or acknowledgement that is deserves. I will not go into detail about the story, the characters, sound or any of that (HOWEVER, I love the opening, story, characters and art.. such beautiful art...) <br />
<br />
All I will say is this: This show is amazing.<br />
<br />
Its hilarious. Its intense. Its my favourite anime EVER. (and that&#039;s saying something)<br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126617">
        have not seen any other sports anime (apart from YowaPedal which is also currently airing), so I have nothing to compare this to. I have not read the manga either; I was going to, but this show is so damn god I cant bring myself to spoil the next part of the story.<br />
<br />
I have seen a lot of anime, but never have I responded to any like this. After watching the latest episode (13) I downloaded the series and have since watched all the episodes up until then again. I seriously cannot get enough of this show!<br />
<br />
I feel so inspired by the main protagonist, Eijun Sawamura; he knows he is not the best, and very far from it. He does not know his potential and does not understand his true talent- which really stands out in this story. Us as viewers know he has it, and he has to become aware of it himself. He has an unwavering dream of becoming the best, the ace of the team, and is simply inspiring. I find it hard to describe, but if you watch the show, you are sure to understand. Though some may seem bothered by his personality, I love it. He is comical when he needs to be, but also serious and has unmatched trust and devotion to his teammates. Each character is individual and different, and it is hard not to like any of them.<br />
<br />
As far as the story goes, many people have dropped it because of the slow start- it currently has an unknown number of episodes and the manga is still ongoing, so it is likely to be a longer running anime. However, after episode 10, things start getting more intense, and episode 13 was absolutely perfect.<br />
<br />
If you have spare time on your hands, go watch this. if you don&#039;t, go watch it anyway. If you think you don&#039;t like baseball (like me), watch it. I don&#039;t care. I think I&#039;m becoming a baseball fan just because of this anime. I LIVE for my Sundays now, as soon as the latest episode is released, I drop everything to watch it<br />
<br />
I went into this anime not expecting much (not being a fan of baseball), and came out with it being my favourite anime of all time. This may not be everyone&#039;s cup of tea, but if even one person gets as much enjoyment and excitement out of this anime as I did, then my job is as good as done. So why are you still here? Go watch it!

    It&#039;s hard to talk about what&#039;s actually great about this anime, it&#039;s the type of anime that you&#039;d just get excited by watching, even if you sometimes don&#039;t know why exactly is it so exciting.<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
The story isn&#039;t so interesting, it won&#039;t draw your attention when you read the synopses, especially since the show took a kinda different way than the first two episodes.<br />
It starts with the main character &quot;Sawamura Eijun&quot; who loves Baseball, and plays it everyday with his friends, who are not so good at it, one day he gets a chance to go to &quot;Seido&quot; a school with a strong Baseball team, even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139805">
        though he turns down the offer, because he doesn&#039;t want to leave his friends who got stuck playing Baseball with him for too long, but he ends up going anyway, after he tries to play a little challenge against a Seido player, which gets him so excited.<br />
After that, the plot focuses on all of the players, and we never see Sawamura&#039;s friends again (not until episode 27 at least).<br />
I&#039;m actually okay with that, because all of the characters are interesting, and the rivalry among the team&#039;s players is what makes this show so unique, it kinda reminded me of Slam Dunk.<br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
The art of this show is so amazing, it deserves a prize! you can actually check out the opening theme, the art of the show is as good as that, and its level doesn&#039;t drop at any point, it&#039;s always beautiful.<br />
The way the characters look when they are serious gets me excited even more than I already am!<br />
<br />
-Sound-<br />
The first opening is very good, I listened to it in every episode, I also liked the second opening, The endings are beautiful too.<br />
The background music is awesome, I sometimes think that the music is what makes me get too excited in this show!<br />
<br />
-Character-<br />
Let&#039;s see, there are already more than twenty characters, and every one of them is interesting in their own way, I like how the attention is not only focused on the main character Sawamura, but every other player in the team gets to have their role in the show, even though some characters didn&#039;t have their time to shine, not yet at least.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
I was planning to ignore all other points and only talk about how enjoyable this anime is, if you give it a try, you may end up watching it through the latest episode in one set, it doesn&#039;t contain any fillers, and never waste the time of the episode, almost every episode contains some action, or drama.<br />
Also, the funny moments are funny, they never ruin the atmosphere, they actually make it more interesting.<br />
And what makes it more enjoyable, is the details about the training, and how every character has a specialty, and even though they support each other, they&#039;re rivals as well.<br />
<br />
-Overall-<br />
If you want something enjoyable and easy to watch, that&#039;s Diamond no Ace.

    DnA is probably one of the best sports anime that I&#039;ve come across yet. Although hailing from a country where Baseball is scarce, this started out to be a pretty interesting anime. It begins with an aspiring young pitcher named Eijun Sawamura, who throws a wild ball which flies over the catcher giving him no chance to seize it. This happens to grab the attention of a particular woman who turns out to be a scout for the baseball team of the highly popular school named Seido. Hence unfolding the journey which awaited Eijun in his future. <br />
<br />
What really got me into this at first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184285">
        was the soundtrack which had a pretty intimidating atmosphere. Even when I first heard the opening, &quot;Go EXCEED!!&quot;, I was really fascinated by it and knew it was special. Same goes for the other two openings which approach as the show progresses. The endings were pretty fine too but average compared to the opening themes. <br />
<br />
All the characters are pretty neatly drawn but there were some flaws too as most of the players in the team who rarely got featured were very dull to look at. <br />
<br />
I would gladly recommend Diamond no Ace to anyone who is into sports anime&#039;s. <br />
There is a second season coming out and I have high expectations for it.<br />

    (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)<br />
<br />
[Synopsis]: After failing to take his middle-school team to Nationals, Sawamura Eijun (Osaka, Ryota) decides to enroll at the prestigious Seidou High in order to pursue his aspirations in baseball. The story follows him and the Seidou team as he trains and practices to become the ace pitcher of the team and they try to restore Seidou to its former glory after it’s 6 year absence from the Koushien championship.<br />
<br />
[Characters]:<br />
<br />
As is the case with many sports shows, Diamond no Ace has an impressively large cast of characters and so I will address the cast mostly as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189692">
        whole entity with some focus on the most primary characters.<br />
<br />
Despite there being multiple characters, such as Furuya Satoru and Miyuki Kazuya, who also recieve a good deal of the narrative spotlight, I think that Eijun is the indisputable protagonist and the show concerns itself first and foremost with his experiences at Seidou. With this being the case, I think one’s enjoyment of the show can be either amplified or hampered by their level of enjoyment of Eijun though there are plenty of other characters who they might attach themselves to. He is strong-willed, boisterous, and at times obnoxious in his often overenthusiastic approach to things. He is extremely motivated towards reaching his goal of becoming the ace pitcher for the team as well as winning the summer tournament and attending Nationals. While Eijun has a few skills to start out with, his knowledge of pitching and of the sport is mediocre and so his learning as a first-year doubles as character progression for him and explanatory insight into the strategy of the game for the viewer.<br />
<br />
Along with Eijun there are a few other first-year characters (and one second-year) who show notable growth throughout the series. Furuya Satoru is a highly talented pitcher who often acts as Eijun’s rival on the team, Kominato Haruichi is the skilled younger sibling of one of the third-year students, and Miyuki Kazuya is an all-star catcher who enjoys manipulating and reigning in his unruly pitchers. The Seidou school accepts a great many skilled players however the most important of them belong to the First-String – primarily the third-year players and those skilled enough to win tournament games (the top 20 players for the summer tournament). While these people are the most often featured throughout the show as they play in all of the important games, they are a little slow to be explored initially and not every player is as memorable as the next even on the main team.<br />
<br />
As for the characters not part of the main team, because it is impossible to present an entire team that is foreign to the audience with the same level of intrigue as the main cast, the opposing teams most often feature between 2 and 3 characters of note – one usually with slightly more backstory or context than the others. In this way, the teams themselves are not very memorable however they can be identified easily enough by means of their noteworthy player(s). These characters are usually interesting enough however I found that a good deal of the opponents were not as memorable as I might have wished with the exception of a select few. Overall, the method used here is both sufficient and necessary and certain viewers may gravitate in interest towards one interesting player or another.<br />
<br />
[Art/Animation]:<br />
<br />
I found the art and animation to be highly consistent throughout the show despite its 75-episode length and at no point did I find there was a notable drop in quality. The character designs are pretty subdued as the show comes off as fairly realistic in its approach and so the players look normal while each appearing different enough to be distinguishable from one another. I myself was felt underwhelmed with the art style if only in that it felt like a pretty standard approach to things and didn’t feature anything particularly adventurous however it works perfectly well for what it tries to do and I have no actual qualms with the designs or animation. It was well done however was not done so in such a way that I would actively list it as a strength of the show. In the same vein of the unadventurous approach, I thought that the comedic scenes and comical faces and animations were pretty run of the mill and I didn’t think any gag save maybe 2 really did much for me throughout the show.<br />
<br />
One of my biggest gripes with the show appears in this category and that is its rampant overuse of the ‘white background’ effect. In moments of intensity or drama, it can be visually helpful to have the scenery and setting fall away in place of the character’s reaction or realization and add to the emotion or excitement of the moment however in the case of Diamond no Ace I found it made such excessive use of this technique that it felt exhausted after just a handful of episodes. There are plenty of cases within the show where it uses the white background successfully however with its appearance 4 to 5 times an episode for 75 episodes, its usage firstly comes off as a bit boring and secondly somewhat tarnishes what could have otherwise be well executed uses of the technique in later scenes. What I want for the show in the future is for it to allow the scenes and sentiments stand on their own from time to time while avoiding the usage of a potentially good concept.<br />
<br />
[Story]:<br />
<br />
The show starts a little slow as it introduces us to Eijun and subsequently the structure of Seidou High. While this pacing is retrospectively not an issue within the context of its 75-episode length, it is quite slow by other standards. I felt it took nearly 20 episodes to start rolling which can be quite demanding if someone is trying to get into the show. The show has a good deal of drama however I thought that at least the early episodes came off as a little melodramatic whereas the later parts of the show address more interesting and legitimate problems and dilemmas.<br />
<br />
The pacing of the games was actually quite an interesting element of the show. At times the games would start off with the first at bat and play out for a good while from there however there were plenty of instances where the show would launch into a prospective game after a couple innings. I found this allowed the games to focus around the compelling parts of the game while avoiding perhaps some of the more typical moments. It also allowed for the show to setup certain situations without having to spend time prefacing itself – the game could start with 2 runners on base and a full count and you are immediately brought into the excitement of the moment. The end of the games were also sometimes subject to this approach in that, after resolving the key drama of the game or watching a major game-changing play, the game would end as expected and it would skip ahead to the celebration or the aftermath. Overall, I found this kept things fresh and cut out things that otherwise may have seemed grating and so this narrative technique I found to be a strong point within the show.<br />
<br />
The show is, to a degree, pitcher-centric which is somewhat to be expected given the main character’s vocation and the way baseball is played – it simply wouldn’t be as interesting if it focused on left field or the shortstop. Because of this necessary focus, we spend a good deal of time, especially in the early half of the show, with the pitchers of the Seidou team. They each have their own unique style; for instance Eijun is known for his unwieldy and aggressive but hard-to-hit pitches whereas Furuya throws an incredible fastball. The show features good progression in the way of their pitching styles and approaches however because each pitcher has a lot of ground to cover, the pitching styles start off rather stark and simple. This can be problematic in the first half of the show because the lack of a dynamic strategy within the main focus of the games can come off as a little boring and it takes a while before things start to mix up.<br />
<br />
Lastly, because the show takes a long time to get moving and must introduce a lot of different players on the main team, the highlighting of the opposing players starts off a little lackluster whereas the show gets much better at presenting these characters as the show progresses. As Seidou faces tougher and tougher teams in either tournament games or scrimmages, the number of interesting opponents on any one team gradually grows slightly which I felt helped the opposing teams seem more formidable. The progression from one team with a single outstanding player towards one with multiple was an interesting way to evolve the gameplay without making certain players seem unnaturally good or other teams much worse than they were – each team feels like a legitimate challenge at some level.<br />
<br />
[Music]:<br />
<br />
The music is good enough however I felt it was almost non-present in the early episodes of the show as far as impact is concerned – it was discernible but dialed back. The music was decent when it came around however it didn’t blow me away with its appearance despite adding to the scenes successfully. As the show progresses into the later half of the episodes I found that there were maybe 2 to 3 recognizable songs that would play repeatedly in accordance with the big action scenes or dramatic moments. They worked well however I felt the show was somewhat lacking diversity in this area and I would have liked a few more songs of note to have appeared in this same manner and with similar levels of execution.<br />
<br />
[Final Thoughts and Rating]: <br />
<br />
Diamond no Ace is a show that accomplishes what it sets out to do. It does baseball well and the characters and plays are appealing enough that one can easily find themselves interested in the outcome of things. Some areas where the show loses some points for me are the sometimes obnoxious nature of the protagonist, the somewhat uninspired art approach, the overuse of certain dramatic visuals, and the slow to start pacing of the show. I also felt that the comedy was pretty lacking despite its frequent presence in each episode. It came off as very bland both in terms of the gags and the character reactions and really didn’t further my enjoyment of the show in any way.<br />
<br />
Rating: 7<br />
<br />
I gave the show a 7 because, either by way of its high points or its consistent appeal, the show was enjoyable. It falls short in a few regards as discussed above and many of those things are fairly subjective to me and so it’s perfectly reasonable that anyone who finds themselves more engrossed in either the main character or the beginning of the show will enjoy the show a good deal more as it only gets better as it continues.<br />
<br />
[Recommendations]:<br />
<br />
I would recommend Diamond no Ace to any sports fan as I think it does the genre well. The show has good dramatic moments that usually come with the territory of sports and so I would recommend it for that reason as well. Those interested in inter-team rivalry would do well to watch as there is a fair amount of competition in this regard which is not something I see in every sports show.

    The one thing I felt missing from Major as much as I loved it, was how little of it was focused on high school baseball. <br />
<br />
Diamond no Ace, or Ace of the Diamond, differs from this and is quite strongly focused on high school baseball, and true to it&#039;s name focuses on finding the &#039;Ace&#039; of the team; the pitcher that will bring the team to victory. <br />
<br />
Before I go on I should mention the image you get of Sawamura from the first 2 episodes differs quite a little from how he ends up during the rest of the series. Think &#039;Small Town Hero, Big

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124493">
        City Zero.&#039; :P<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t an anime about a kid with outstanding talent, it&#039;s about a boy who finds himself realising that the world of high school baseball is much bigger than he knew. Having been the star of his &#039;makeshift&#039; middle school team he is thrown in the deep end when he encounters people with more obvious talents than himself.<br />
<br />
Yes, he&#039;s got potential and yes there&#039;s the regular &#039;train to get stronger&#039; theme that fits in perfectly within a sports setting. He has rivals within his own team, and due to his peculiar way of pitching* he has to prove himself to the large number of students also eager to make the starter team for Koushien. <br />
<br />
DnA has a great storyline, original perhaps not, but the relationships between the teammates, the &#039;senpai-kouhai&#039; dynamics and the hands-on coaching, gives DnA its own flavour, not to mention it has no shortage of hilarious moments. Despite how slowly it starts off concentrating mainly on training, the &#039;real&#039; matches begin and you will no doubt be rooting for this &#039;always out of reach&#039; team to win, win and win in face of the unexpected adversity they encounter.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for romance you won&#039;t find any here, it&#039;s all about baseball, (and Sawamura being a fool). If you want something where the protagonist &#039;wins&#039; all the time, then you&#039;re out of luck. If you want something where the main character is a diamond in the rough however, this is your thing. (Him and his peers).<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like the pacing of the anime, but I could be biased having read the manga already. It&#039;s a bit too stretched out for my liking, which I think in an anime that doesn&#039;t carry the same buzz as Major did is a mistake. The voice acting is really on key, the characters all suit their voices, especially lil&#039; old Harucchi who is my favourite character. <br />
<br />
The animation aspect of it is slightly lacking, since it is a sports anime it should have a little more &#039;excitement&#039; to it. <br />
<br />
Personally I love it, you can relate to the MC, well at least I can. He struggles on whilst faced with the reality he is not the best, and it works well for him. I just hope other people like it too, because it gets much better, and since it&#039;s a very long-running series there is much more to it than what just one season will provide us with. Though even then it is still a really entertaining show to watch with plenty of good moments to keep you interested. <br />
<br />
*Sawamura does NOT have the same pitching style as Gorou-Major, his rival&#039;s pitching style is more similar to Gorou&#039;s. Sawamura&#039;s... well you just have to watch it and realise he is his own breed of awesome. :)<br />
<br />

    NOTE - Do NOT be fooled by the first few episodes or the sport. This is pretty much the Hunter x Hunter 2011 of Shounen sports anime. Starts off typical and ends up something completely different.<br />
<br />
Story - 10/10<br />
The story is for me split into 2 parts. The first part (episodes 1-20) is used to introduce the characters, the game and the world of this anime. It does so by relying on cliche&#039;s. Its the weakest part of the series.<br />
The second part is episode 20 onwards. This is where the writers talent really shines. After going through all the cliche&#039;s most of the setup is done

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194079">
        for the main teams and we enter our first major arc. This arc is only a taste of what&#039;s to come, it has everything. The series becomes much more strategic, much more tense, much more emotional, much faster paced, and much much more unpredictable. <br />
The writing is exceptional in every regard. From tone shifts, to little bits of foreshadowing, everything is perfectly written. Its one of the few anime that even after a major shift in the story which completely changes the series and characters forever, it still manages to impress me in all the ways it previously had. <br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation - 9.5/10<br />
For a 75 episode series the art and animation is absolutely breathtaking. Its no surprise knowing that this is done by the two leading studios in the industry, Madhouse (HxH2011) and Production I.G. (Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu, Attack on Titan). Take the beautiful art of Hunter x Hunter 2011&#039;s Chimera Ant arc and merge with the fluidity and intensity of Haikyuu and that&#039;s the art and animation in a nutshell. Its done in a way that the slow sport of baseball ends up being much more intense than a basketball match from Kuroko No Basket. It&#039;s beautifully done. Only major flaw is that some episodes, especially when the studios have new anime starting at the same time, tend to have simplified art, but it is still acceptable as they are in the minority.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10/10<br />
The music of this series is phenominal. The ost sounds very similar to that of a work by Hiroyuki Sawano, consisting of guitar solo&#039;s, rock instruments, large orchestrations and even a cover of a song from Micheal Bay&#039;s Transformers! (which far outdo&#039;s the original)<br />
The opening&#039;s and ending&#039;s are especially note worthy. In particular those done by GLAY and the band consisting of the composer and co-composer called OxT (you may know them from Overlord&#039;s opening)<br />
I&#039;d also like to take a moment to talk about the voice actors. HOLY S H I T! (excuse my language) There talent is amazing. It&#039;s so obvious that they are pouring there heart and soul into this and the ending themes they themselves create are some of the best ending themes of there year. (Final Victory by the Voice Actor of our main character is easily my ending theme of last year)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - I&#039;ve already watched the anime 5 times in the past 4 months.... its saddening I can&#039;t give it more. 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall - 10/10<br />
With absolutely phenomenal writing that has the ability the grab your heart and stomp it almost every episode, either through heart breaking scenes that are expertly animated and directed, or moments of hope when your heart is jumping with joy at the pleasure of having this experience, this is an anime that is beautifully directed, flawlessly paced, phenomenally written, flawlessly composed and beautifully animated, this is easily in my opinion the greatest sports anime of all time, and easily one of the greatest anime of all time.<br />
<br />
People who think it will be useless and boring because its about baseball let me leave you with this....<br />
MADHOUSE X PRODUCTION I.G. X UFOTABLE

    This is my first review on one of my favorite anime as well as one of my second best sports anime of all time. This is a kind of anime which makes you watch for more after each episode. This anime does character development superbly.<br />
<br />
Story 9<br />
The story of this anime is well written. IT shows all the aspect of main character life as well as gives enough story of side characters. It knows the perfect timing of telling the story of character and makes sure that person watching it doesn&#039;t get bored. Even though the story is well written the episodes in the series feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190432">
        a bit stretched. In the end the story feels good if you watch it in whole completed series, and beware that series doesn&#039;t have the main ending instead it stretch out to second season.<br />
<br />
Art 8<br />
The art in this anime is pretty good. I also can&#039;t say that it is too good counting that it is a newer series. The art is good enough that it is not worse like &#039;ping pong&#039; nor it is as good as &#039;free&#039;. In the end art is well fitting for the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
 This anime is one of the best baseball anime which only focuses on the sports rather than making a romance out of it. This anime in my opinion very much in top five best sports anime. In the end, Diamond no ace is a treat to watch and a fabulous anime.

    This is my first review, excuse me if I didn&#039;t do well.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10) <br />
The story doesn&#039;t really sound all that special, it&#039;s something we see all the time in anime but don&#039;t let that put you off. The story starts off with our main character Sawamura Eijun, he loves baseball and has a goal of going to nationals with his group of friends. After losing a game, one day Sawamura gets called downstairs to find out he has been invited to Seido High School, which is apparently famous for its strong baseball team. At first Sawamura declines the offer because of his friends but visiting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158453">
        the school and meeting a few, lets say, interesting characters, changes his mind and soon after he starts his journey to become the ace of Seido baseball team. <br />
<br />
Art (9/10) <br />
I saw no real problem with the art in this anime, actually its really well done. It is consistent and never drops in quality.<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10)<br />
So far all of the OPs and EDs have been good, I didn&#039;t feel the urge to skip them, in fact I find myself enjoying listening to and watching them. The background music is also very good, it helps set the sometimes tense and sometimes exciting atmosphere in each and every game. <br />
<br />
Characters (9/10)<br />
I love all of the characters so far, and there is a lot of them, but each and every one is different in their own way. Its interesting to see some of the characters stray away from the generic characters you usually find in sports/shounen animes. I also like that you get to know a lot about the supporting characters instead of just focusing on the main characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
Diamond no Ace is an extremely enjoyable anime, it has the ability to make you laugh but can also get you on the edge of your seat in some of the intense moments, it had me watching episode after episode and once i had got up to date i almost wished there were another 45 episodes so i could keep going.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
So far Diamond no Ace has been an exciting anime that will easily have you hooked. The animation is very well done, the soundtrack is fitting and the characters are outstanding. This is definitely an anime worth watching!

    Yes, I know that that number of episodes are intimidating, but this anime is truly one of the greatest sports anime I have seen up to date. I normally do not like to watch sport animes, but after convincing myself to keep an open mind, I tried this anime out. And now i am simply hooked. I would like to say beforehand that this anime is not yet completed, everything in here is my own opinion, and that I definitely give this an a solid 10/10<br />
<br />
The storyline is rather simple, but just to sum it up in a few words; Sawamura is a country boy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177161">
        who loves baseball, and gets scouted for Seido High School&#039;s baseball team in the city. A simple baseball anime but the way the story is played out is amazing! The character interactions and the  tournaments are very well developed and invigorating. The beginning starts off rather slow but intriguing enough to continue. However once you reach deeper into the anime, you have seen these characters work so hard and bond so well for so long that to see them win or lose completely moves you to feel as they do. Also this anime is very realistic about how baseball is played, how teams do win and lose, and does not have any ridiculous-named moves/attacks.<br />
<br />
The art style might be what turns you away but I find it okay and very unique. Its graphics and animation is not out-of-this-world amazing, but its good enough to keep you okay with it and continue the show. But I do think that the animation for the game scenes are done rather well. The slow-motion or the fast-pace combined with the music really gets you absorbed into the moment<br />
<br />
The OSTs are also something to be praised. I wouldn&#039;t call the music original but it has character to it. The OSTs fit into their respective scenes and some of them even have the power to move you to feel energized or sad or even shocked. As mentioned above the music combined with the scene in the game really has an impact.<br />
<br />
A 10/10 for these characters are very very well developed, and absolutely none are hate-able. There is a huge cast of different teams and its amazing how the mangaka is able to make each and every one of them special and different. Right off form the bat, I was able to remember who was who and their special little quirks that make them so likable! It is a pleasure to watch these different characters learn how to trust each other and form a team based connected and strengthen by their individual special skills. Ace of Diamond really shows how important teamwork and trust is in baseball and also in life. <br />
You can really see the strong bonds between characters and that shows in their great display of teamwork. I greatly admire all of the teamwork and friendship that the characters display. They act cute and funny with each other, but right in the next moment, can act serious. Especially after watching these characters struggle to improve themselves through hours of long practice and learn how to trust each other, you get really attached to them. You even get attached to the opponents because of how great they fought to win. <br />
<br />
Yes that was a very long paragraph for characters, so all you need to really know is that these characters are extremely likable, display great teamwork, and have the funniest to the most serious interactions with one other.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you like sports anime will determine if you like this anime, but it certainly doesn&#039;t hurt to give sport animes a shot.  Ace of Diamond is realistic, funny, suspenseful, and, for me at certain scenes, tear-jerking. I am rather glad that I opened myself because then i would have never been able to have the pleasure in watching Ace of Diamond.

    I&#039;m about to punch myself in the eye for not watching this anime sooner. I never really have been too great with words, but I want to do the best I can to explain all the things this anime does so well because it exceeded any expectations I had for it.<br />
<br />
Being with the sound design, the score for this anime is phenomenal. Not only is the music able to convey the emotion of a scene well, but it&#039;s capable of forcing the emotion onto the audience. There were a few times that the writing would put me in a situation that was already highly emotional,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324055">
        but the music would really send it to a new realm. If we&#039;re talking about the art, it&#039;s easy to talk about the style itself or how nice the character designs are, but the animation is what&#039;s really worth talking about. You&#039;ve obviously got a lot of movement when it comes to sports anime, and baseball especially is a really mobile sport in a lot of differing ways; this anime absolutely knocked those animations out of the park. Whether it was to convey speed, depth, strength, or power, the animation took it above and beyond.<br />
<br />
Moving onto the good stuff now, let&#039;s get into the story. Two things this anime does better than, dare I say, most sports anime out there is tension and tone. Along with the idea of tension, the story was able to pull off an unparalleled level of suspense. I mentioned this when discussing the sound design, but the story also aids to put the audience in emotional positions through the tone it&#039;s written in. It was easy for me to get completely locked into a high-paced scene or feel heavy during a sorrowful one. And the sorrowful scenes? Oh, they hit hard. Even within the humor of the series-- which is an accomplishment on its own-- the tone was put down beautifully. As for tension, let me just tell you, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been as on edge as I was during the course of this anime. I think that&#039;s because you really never know what&#039;s going to happen within the story, which pulls it back around to the suspense factor. Typically, in competition anime, certain things are bound to happen that&#039;ll tip the viewer off as to what&#039;s about to happen next. Even if it&#039;s just a few seconds prior, the build-up to certain moments is very clear. Diamond no Ace didn&#039;t do that. At all. It tricked you until the very end by using music, tone, and tension to lead you to believe something was going to happen that could end up getting completely flipped by the end. And it did it well. It did it in a way that made a lot of sense and created a lot of interest in the story. The really only negative thing I can think to say about this anime is that the pacing of the events was strange to get used to. It started with a lot of practice time, and then flipped into nearly no off time from the games they were playing, so it started to feel like it was all going by really quickly. That being said, in the long run, I think the set up used to tell the story made a lot of sense. It&#039;s unique to me, but being able to choose the optimal times to show character improvement as opposed to game experience and vise versa is a brilliant feature to have in a story. <br />
<br />
Onto the thing that&#039;s probably the hardest for me to talk about: the characters. I&#039;m not sure exactly how to explain the care that was taken in developing these characters without giving too much away, but it&#039;s something that needs to be noted. When you have main characters, they need to meet a certain list of requirements to be worthy of the audience&#039;s interest. Those things can be something like: a goal for them to meet, a strong and memorable personality, good opportunities for development, etc. This anime made me think that&#039;s there&#039;s so much more that should be on that list than I ever knew. Throughout this anime, I got to understand these characters wholly and without any missing pieces. The experience they gained wasn&#039;t unrealistic. If they fall down, they didn&#039;t always get right back up. If they had the determination to do something, it didn&#039;t always work out. This anime wrote *people* and not characters. Yes, they have to be slightly surreal in their abilities and personalities for this to be an interesting story, but they had a special level of depth that I really can&#039;t say if I&#039;ve seen from this genre yet or not. <br />
<br />
The story is fearless, the characters pull you in, and everything artistically that went into Diamond no Ace just makes it all the more enjoyable to watch. Not a lot of anime have been able to so boldly make my favorites list, but this one did. It&#039;s special, and I&#039;m ready to spend all the time I can with these characters and their baseball.

    I was initially introduced to this show when through a comment on a show saying &quot;Man.. Ace of Diamond makes my Saturdays better.&quot; Having no expectations for this show, I decided to watch it because I had not else better to watch. I mean, let’s be real… With Basketball, and Volleyball, and Soccer, and other sports, Baseball is obviously not the most exciting sport to watch. But man, was I wrong.The first click to episode 1 landed me to episode 13. Marathoning all the airing episodes, I was so excited and couldn&#039;t focus on any other anime or school work, or sleep or anything at

The art, story, sound and character are elements that help make this anime shine;but the one element that distinguish this anime from a diamond and a mere crystal are the characters. At first impression, Eijun Sawamura may only appear to be a  a silly boy with a talent for baseball; however, that is not all this anime presents. Sawamura is carefree but not lazy, rowdy but still serious, simple but not brainless. Even though this is a show that is shown on a screen, each and every one of the character traits are delivered appropriately. As if the characters were flesh and blood, you could see their disappointment, cheer them on their success and laugh with them on their mistakes.Sure, you can watch an anime and know which character is an idiot or an intellect,talented or not,but, very rarely, would there be an instant where you could watch an anime and actually know about the characters as if they were your best friend. All the characters such as Sawamura, Furuya, Ryousuke, Yuki and  his teammates and their rivals are created and developed splendidly.To be honest, this was one of the few anime where I remember most of the names of the characters. I mean I don&#039;t even remember what I wore yesterday or what my breakfast was, so imagine how I managed to remember 50 characters in a show..<br />
<br />
While the story may seem to follow the typical sports anime route, the most important aspect about the story is the message it delivers:&quot;Not everyone is good at first.&quot; &quot;Practice makes permanent.&quot; The best feature of this anime is that it motivates individuals to strive to improve and practice. Whether it be baseball, soccer, studying, piano, it is not talent that is the deciding factor, but ultimately, it is effort that counts.<br />
<br />
 Along with the character and beautiful art, the soundtrack is gear that pumps motivation and excitement in the anime. I been waiting for 50 episodes for the soundtrack to get released and now it&#039;s finally out!! Not to sound crazy or anything,but I listen to the soundtrack to get inspired and find motivation to study and it works!<br />
<br />
Honestly, I found this anime by surprise, and I can say I&#039;m never so glad I didn&#039;t overlook it. This anime is a long adventure, but I can ensure you, it&#039;s not a boring one.  Throwing in interesting characters, humor, art and  amazing soundtracks, the producers have churned out an amazing sport anime. Whether you want to kill time, ease away your sadness, or look for motivation. This is the right sport anime for you. <br />

    TLDR Review: <br />
     I don’t exactly enjoy the idea of rating something before it’s over but after 59 episodes I think I&#039;ve gotten the gist of the show. From the standpoint of someone who has been around and played baseball since I was able to walk, Diamond no Ace is a show that gets baseball right. DnA is by no means a perfect show but in terms of understanding the sport of baseball and developing the characters as a result, it hits the nail on the head. So if you are looking for a realistic baseball anime then DnA should be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171499">
        on your very short plan-to-watch list. <br />
<br />
In Depth Review: <br />
    For me, personally, I&#039;ve found shows that exceed the 20-30 episode mark are hard to get into. Though I never felt that while watching DnA, now whether that was because of my ability to relate to the characters and the situations or not could be left up for interpretation. DnA is simply the anime adaptation of the DnA manga that has been published since 2006 and is still publishing. The current show is being animated primarily by Production I.G. with help from Madhouse. The show begins with a practically hopeless pitcher by the name of Eijun Sawamura who has a couple tricks up his sleeve. Eijun is scouted during a game with his middle school team and ends up getting an offer to play baseball with one of the most renowned baseball high schools in all of Tokyo: Seido. The story picks up from there on, so for the sake of not spoiling anything major I will not say any more. With that aside lets begin with the actual review. <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10 <br />
    The story itself is not anything special, it follows your regular routine in a shonen similar to that of Naruto. Where the main protagonist is not reliable in the slightest but has the will and determination to get better, However the story begins to take a bit of a turn after the initial arc. The story turns more into the team itself instead of what the main character can accomplish and that in itself turns into one of the story’s strong points. Granted that the story is a bit generic but you can’t exactly expect much in that aspect from a light-hearted sports anime, what the show does it does to the best of its abilities. <br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10 <br />
     The characters are one of, if not the strongest point of this show. As I said previously the show turns into more of the team and form that you don’t just feel for one of the characters but everyone as a whole. You physically want them to win against every team they play against, following every player and hoping that they can do their part in sealing the win for the team. Characters are certainly something that this show did right and I feel other shows could learn from it.  <br />
<br />
Art: 6/10 <br />
     Unfortunately the art and animation suffer a bit because of the sheer length of the show. You can’t exactly ask for gorgeous fight scenes, well in this case batting or fielding scenes. Mainly due to the fact that the animation studios simply do not have the money to invest into a 60+ episode series. I won’t harp on the art for too long but they do again use it to the best of their abilities which is by no means a bad thing. All in all the art is not bad, it’s just very mediocre from their excessive use of still frames and such. <br />
<br />
Music/Sound Design: 7/10 <br />
       In terms of sound and music design there really isn&#039;t much to choose from aside from the sounds of dialogue and baseballs being hit and caught. With the occasional hype music to keep you in tune with the scene. Aside from those sounds, which do in fact sound accurate, I can’t REALLY rate this. So from that I just went with my go to rating, really nothing more to say about this. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10 <br />
       Now I don’t particularly like to rate things subjectively but because this one hit home (no pun intended) for me this is MY opinion on the show. It really reminded me of some of the things that baseball was to me, whether remembering these things are a bad thing or not I have yet to find out. The show suffers from small things such as many still frames and mediocre animation but that is not what makes this show great. The teamwork of everyone, the build-up of every antagonist and every game, giving characters that need a back-story one. Everything about this show just fits for what it is. Sports anime can be particularly hard to get into, especially if you don’t understand many of the complex rules of the game such as baseball. However this show is by no means hard to get into and if you’re looking for a longer sports show, give it a try. <br />

    This anime is not yet completed but I am up-to-date in the episodes and have watched every single episode that is out so far. I wanted to give this anime a review however of what I&#039;ve seen so far. I watched a couple of sports anime before I started watching this anime but I never had seen a baseball one before. This anime did not disappoint. The reasons why is not because the characters &quot;love the sport&quot;. In every sports anime a character has to love the sport in order for it to even be considered a sports anime. No, the reason that I found

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166635">
        this anime very intriguing is because of the characters. Never have I ever been so in love and involved with characters from an anime before. I mean I&#039;ve seen a lot of sports animes and this anime&#039;s storyline is no different from the rest but man the characters are really what keeps you watching this anime.<br />
<br />
Sawamura Eijun, is an open book, loud and very oboxious and like basically what everyone calls him in the anime he is a complete and utter idiot when it comes to baseball. That is why he is so lovable. He is a character you want to root for and you want to succeed. It is because he isn&#039;t amazing at the sport that makes the character really relatable. He becomes real. When Eijun is learning about the sport those of us who don&#039;t know the sport are learning as well. So in that sense Eijun is essentially the &quot;viewer&quot;. You make think that sound crazy but I believe when watching this anime it literally feels like you become the characters. I easily found myself in every character because each character all have one aspect that is purely &quot;their  character&quot; if that makes any sense haha. I could go in full detail on every main character in this anime but that would just take too much time. However, I will point out a few characters watch out for.<br />
<br />
Miyuki Kazuya, is the essential catcher of the first string team of Seidou. The character is very essential in bringing out Eijun&#039;s potential. That is because he is the one who catching  Eijun&#039;s pitches. He has what the other characters of the anime say &quot;twisted personality&quot; but  despite that he is a truly amazing baseball player. He even was showcased in sports magazines in the anime. That is how skilled of a catcher he is.  His dynamic with Eijun is pretty amazing. Despite the fact that Eijun doesn&#039;t respect him (because of his twisted personality) like he does with his other sempais, Miyuki is someone that Eijun needs to become a better pitcher and grow into a better baseball player.<br />
<br />
Furuya Satoru is literally and emotionless character. He literally always have a blank face unless he feel faint or two he feels really furious. He is an amazing fastball pitcher and is more skilled that Eijun is in regards to pitching which makes him Eijun&#039;s rival in becoming the &quot;ace of the diamond&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kominato Haruichi is another essential character in this anime. He hasn&#039;t gotten much story so far in the anime but the fact that he has to live up to his older brother Kominato Ryousuke makes his story so appealing as well. There are so many other characters that I can explain but these are the main ones that you really follow throughout the anime.<br />
<br />
The rivalry between Seidou and Inashiro is the true driving force of this anime. Every episode is leading up to this &quot;Final Game&quot; that decides which team gets to go to Nationals. <br />
<br />
What I truly enjoyed about this anime is that every game shown you see a character grow or break. Each game something happens that pulls you into the game and make you root for Seidou. What is also amazing is that Seidou truly is a team just like how Sohoku is truly a team in Kuroko No Basuke.  The players of Seidou truly know how to work together and make such amazing plays that is just astounding. Sure the point of the anime is to find the true &quot;Ace&quot; of the team and I understand that the &quot;Ace&quot; is essential to the team since the &quot;Ace&quot; is the one that holds the team together during a game but because Seidou doesn&#039;t have a true &quot;Ace&quot; makes this anime really special. The whole anime follows specifically Sawamura Eijun a novice pitcher. He and the rest of the pitchers, Furuya, Kawakami and Tanba all fight for the &quot;Ace&quot; title. I have to admit that yes one these pitchers actually does get the &quot;Ace&quot; number but is he really a true ace? Even the coach doesn&#039;t really truly know that yet. <br />
<br />
Point is that this anime really had me reeled in because of the characters and because the anime is still exploring on what a &quot;true ace of the diamond&quot; is. I won&#039;t stop watching this anime until the very end. Everyone who loves sports anime should really give this anime a shot. Even if you don&#039;t really like baseball you will find this anime very enjoyable. I never liked baseball but this gave me a new perspective of the sport and taught me so many things I never knew about the sport. It isn&#039;t just a sports anime where the characters have to win the championship or go to nationals no its a sports anime in which you have not only go to nationals but also figure out the true meaning of the title of the anime &quot;Ace of The Diamond&quot; and that&#039;s something other sports animes don&#039;t have. Something in which the main character wants to become. Other sports anime the team and main characters only want to become national champions and winners or become a &quot;true team&quot; but in this sports anime the main character wants to become the &quot;Ace of The Diamond&quot; and because the fact that the main character has the spirit but not the skills makes this show really worth watching.<br />

    Spoiler free review<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#039;m here to become the ace!&quot; - Sawamura Eijun<br />
<br />
Diamond no Ace is an exhilarating ride - filled with emotion that is complimented by exciting action.<br />
<br />
Story: If one has seen a substantial amount of high school sports anime, one will quickly begin to see that Diamond no Ace follows the typical formula for a successful sports anime albeit with alterations. This makes certain plot elements less meaningful and predictable, however the execution of these elements is skillfully done in order to differ from other titles in its genre.<br />
On the other hand, if one isn&#039;t well-versed in this genre, then congratulations the experience will be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197679">
        amplified by two fold. Plot elements will be original, consequently resulting in the emotional aspects of the plot to be more effective that really pound one&#039;s heart.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: The art quality is fair, it is not the best one has seen nor is it the worst. However, for a series that boasts a 75 episode count, it certainly is impressive that the art quality never deteriorated into a horrible mess, a testament to the studio&#039;s skill and organisation. <br />
What really shines in Diamond no Ace is the animation quality. This is evidently demonstrated when pitches are thrown, one can really feel the intensity, speed and power. This is also the case for batting, catching etc. This type of fluid animation aids to further immerse the viewer into the world of Diamond no Ace.  <br />
<br />
Sound: It is difficult to describe sound in a written review. Nonetheless, the sound in Diamond no Ace, in my humble opinion, is the best aspect of the series. Receiving a great rating of 9. The soundtrack (excluding openings and endings) really accentuates the character&#039;s emotions, their determination, conviction etc. It transforms the baseball field into an epic battlefield unveiling the tense and epic atmosphere the characters are experiencing. The complimenting soundtrack was what enabled me to become a fan of baseball, it converts viewers who never had an interest in baseball to enthusiastically watch and cheer for the team they like best (Seidou for most of us).<br />
<br />
Character: Diamond no Ace has a plethora of characters. This results in a lot of mentor, supporting and rival characters for our main protagonist, Sawamura Eijun to learn and grow from. The bonds that each of these characters share with each other is another aspect in which Diamond no Ace excels at. As we observe the characters throughout each episode, it is evident that all of them slowly grow, adding more depth to the characters which further immerses the viewer into this fictional world creating a more personal link with the characters of the series. However, having too many characters can deteriorate the plot and thus the effectiveness of the series. Although, Diamond no Ace creates great bonds between its characters, some of them seem quite one dimensional, this is especially the case for some of the supporting characters (third years). Furthermore, the overabundance of rivals, existing in the same team, creates a frustrating conflict for the main character. At times, it seems the main antagonist is the rival not the opposing team.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7 - A good rating<br />
Through the combination of impressive animation, decent visuals, amazing sound and a fair plot, the final rating for (non spoiler) Diamond no Ace is a good rating of 7. Worth checking out if you are a fan of sports anime in general. However the limitations due to the character and plot sections prevent this anime from reaching a greater score of an 8 or a 9.          <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review :) below is spoiler filled comment/rant discussing the character and plot sections of this anime.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~spoiler comment alert~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For those of you who have watched the series, i am mainly talking about Furuya. His character was interesting at first, i believed that he was going to be another obstacle to Eijun&#039;s journey in becoming the ace - which was built up from episode 1 and obviously the title reflects that the plot is going to be centered on his journey in becoming the ace, ultimately leading his team to victory.<br />
From episode 1, the audience is teased that our main protagonist was going to form an unstoppable battery with Miyuki - the genius catcher. But this was not the case, as even in the manga Sawamura is still a bench warmer, and at this rate it seems Miyuki is going to graduate before Sawamura ever dreams of becoming the ace. I would understand about 20-30 episodes of Sawamura becoming a bench warmer to Furuya, in order to train and build more character depth in order to return stronger. But unfortunately this was not the case. Even in season 2 of the anime (episode 22 as of this date) and the manga - Sawamura is still a bench warmer. It appears that Sawamura is turning into a support character for Furuya - his rival. He is seen cheering Furuya and motivating him to pitch well, when in reality the main protagonist Sawamura should be pitching as the ace. It is incomprehensible that the main protagonist is reduced to be part of a supporting cast, as Furuya begins to form a battery with Miyuki. After enduring 65 episodes of Sawamura bench warming for Furuya and Tanba (i can accept this), the mangaka wants us to endure another 100 episodes of Sawamura bench warming, and now even being part of Furuya&#039;s supporting cast. I have heard rumors that the mangaka did not originally intend for Sawamura to be the main protagonist but instead have Furuya to be the protagonist, but his editor wanted Sawamura to be the main protagonist due to his Naruto/shounen like personality (no source). Nevertheless, it almost seems that Sawamura is shoehorned into the series at this rate.<br />
<br />
I am not a shounen fan or a Sawamura lover etc. It is frustrating that the character we followed from episode 1 and the character we have the most emotional attachment with is reduced to nothing but a supporting cast. It would of been perfectly fine for Furuya to be the main protagonist if we just followed his journey from the start instead of Sawamura&#039;s, as his character is much more unique and fresh to the sports anime genre.<br />
I am also not a lover of overpowered naruto type of plots either ( i dislike them) , but enduring 65 episodes of training (im sweet with this - was a great arc) then another 30 episodes of bench warming (k, its sweet as long as we see him grow and in the end see him as the ace forming a battery with Miuyki as teased), but then realizing that even in the manga he is still a bench warmer -.- that&#039;s going to be like 100 episodes of bench warming and possibly Miyuki graduating before even forming a battery together. k no thanks -.-<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, a good sports anime series - there is no denying that.<br />
<br />
<br />

    So this is my first review so pls have mercy. This review is also spoiler free.<br />
<br />
Diamond no Ace ( Ace of Diamond) is far too underated outside of Japan.<br />
This year DnA was the 7th most sold manga in Japan (right behind Naruto) so that is proof enough of its greatness. <br />
The story for DnA seems fairky straight forward, to make nationals. However the characters will and devotion to accomplish theis dream is inspiring.<br />
Also there is so many funny and enjoyable characters in this show that it is hard not to like atleast one. I believe the characters make this show, they are easy to follow,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175627">
        relatable, funny and they way they bond and care with eachother leaves us as massive seido fans. (And Kura senpai&#039;s laugh)<br />
The art fits a sports genre well and is well detailed aswell as great op&#039;s. <br />
<br />
It doesnt matter if you arent a sports genre fan, there far more to this show other than gameplay.i know DnA was my 2nd ever sports anime and now it is my all time favorite. I thoroughly reccomend this great and enjoyable series to anyone!  <br />
9/10<br />

    This review may be biased as baseball is definitely not my cup of tea, but comparatively to other sports and specifically baseball animes I&#039;ve seen, this one is near the bottom. Nevertheless, Diamond no Ace does it&#039;s job well- it stuck to it&#039;s focus on baseball, developed a strong cast of likable characters, made every game exciting, and for the most part followed a reasonable plot. If you&#039;re looking for an anime entirely dedicated to baseball, this is it. <br />
<br />
My 5 rating is very harsh considering this show does a lot of things well, notably establishing one of the most enjoyable, unique, and vast cast

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276429">
        of characters. But for a show that is entirely dependent on it&#039;s hype, I lost interest too frequently. <br />
<br />
Considering the sheer length of this show, not much happens. Our MC Eijun is scouted for a prestigious baseball school, assimilates to the baseball club, and goes through a tournament. This could theoretically fit 75 episodes with extensive background development of side characters, episode-long training montages, school life, maybe even romance- but that just doesn&#039;t happen. The tournament starts at around episode 20, meaning this is a 55 episode tournament arc- it&#039;s inherently too long. And yet the show focuses on nothing but the tournament for the following 50 episodes. This means each game becomes progressively longer to fill the inevitable empty space, and that entails constant flashbacks &amp; mundane camera angels between every. single. pitch. I am not exaggerating when saying most flashbacks (which are plentiful) play up to 10 times throughout the tournament arc; the games became awfully slow- painfully slow. <br />
<br />
And while this is very common in shounen, this one really pushes the boundaries. While overusing cliche flashbacks and showcasing the dugout and crowd every 30 seconds, the dramatization never ends which turns itself dull. Yelling is initially exciting, but at some point it becomes too much, unfortunately, that&#039;s the case here. With most games lasting 9 innings, the intelligent-based cast are bestowed closeup screen-time to let the audience know something important is finally about to happen. But the further the tournament progresses they start proclaiming every single inning as the turning point; They start crying wolf. The anime&#039;s pattern in general became very predictable, and I ended up skimming through the end due to lack of interest. <br />
<br />
Lastly the plot is very odd, and personally not to my liking. When following a shounen MC I&#039;m expecting him to be the best. Not from the get go, but he needs to prove his promise. And while Eijun is given immeasurable chances to do so, he seems to always fail when it matters- not once, always. And considering his teammate rival Furuya is outright superior in every sense, seeing Eijun failing again and again and yet still getting supported becomes discouraging. He is in the 1st-string of one of the best baseball schools by sole virtue of his lucky and unique pitching form, and he never pulls through. Either make him struggle more before he makes it or have him be useful. People, even in fiction, don&#039;t get this much back patting. His character design is good, its a waste to have him stubbornly cling to his weaknesses. His existence in the team doesn&#039;t really make sense, might as well have Furuya as the MC, he gets to play nearly twice as much as Eijun. <br />
<br />
The Characters, art, and sound all range from 7-10, but the story and dependent hype enjoyment just doesn&#039;t hold up. If you&#039;re looking for either a baseball or sport anime, there is better out there. But if you truly love baseball animes, the cast, don&#039;t mind hours of ideal time, and already watched the better shows, this isn&#039;t the worst of them either.

    I love this anime. It&#039;s pretty safe to say it is my number one favorite for many reasons. I enjoy sports anime almost religiously so seeing my favorite sport of baseball like this is amazing.<br />
There are an abundance of characters due to the high school in the anime being so large as well as the team. All of them have their individual qualities and ticks that make them all very different and gives a wide variety. The pacing of the show is great with the many games and tournaments as well as the animations of the pitching/gameplay. Nothing is rushed or dragged on.
