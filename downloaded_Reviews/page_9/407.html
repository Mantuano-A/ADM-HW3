    (If you&#039;re looking for a show with quality graphics, an interesting fantasy aspect, a deep story, then this is for you. Please note, this review is more of my first impression since it just came out today.)<br />
<br />
● Story: The story is great. It starts differently than most shows I have watched myself. Instead of starting of with the main characters sad sub-plot, they do some character development and put it later in the episode. I like all the magical being floating around and what not and it feels like a Studio Ghibi film.<br />
<br />
● Art: The art is outstanding. The animation has style and you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228805">
        tell they really put some money into this. The backgrounds are mesmerizing. It&#039;s been a while since I have seen something like it.<br />
<br />
● Sound: The sound is outstanding! The music is beautiful and cinematic. There&#039;s no opening or ending visuals + sounds like other animes. Instead, it&#039;s spent giving the anime overall more screen time. Although, throughout you ears are delighted with music that really fits the settings completely.<br />
<br />
● Character: The characters are very good. Although, since the anime starts off suddenly you have to figure out to everyone is. But that&#039;s not a bad thing. I don&#039;t see any prominent character tropes, thankfully.<br />
<br />
● Enjoyment: My enjoyment of the anime was outstanding! It&#039;s beautiful, has nice characters, a sweet plot (so far) and I love it. I rarely have an anime impact me in a way. I can&#039;t wait for more!<br />
<br />
That&#039;s all. I&#039;ll update this review as more episodes come out! I recommend you check it out though.

    The Mahoutsukai no Yome’s a neat little side story.<br />
<br />
The main appeal of the ova is essentially seeing how everything is presented rather than the actual narrative elements themselves. The anime doesn’t try and get you interested in Chise by telling you she’s an orphan hated by everyone for being weird, it wants you to get invested in her through scenes like her not being able to go to bed because there is literally a monster inside her futon or her talking about how happy she feels when she finishes a book. The story never asks you to doubt that it’s all going to work out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257299">
        fine, it knows its viewer has either already read the source material or totally understands she’s in a better place because of the first part of episode 1, it uses that knowledge to frame a vignette used to contrast her younger self: who always used to sit in a corner, walk with her back slightly bent afraid to connect to people, to her current self: upright, smiling and scared into eating her food instead of avoiding it. The catharsis doesn’t come from what’s framed. But rather the feeling that is evoked when looking at it. Chise didn’t grow much as a person when she gave the book and moved away, she lost more hope than she started out with, but the moment it goes back to her reading the book on Ains’ lap, surrounded by people who care for her, there’s this very understated feeling of relief and ease. The fact that it goes from her not believing that it will all turn out alright to her having turned out fine in a few seconds doesn’t take away from the unease and anxiety that filled her childhood because it was a retrospective to begin with and only furthers the message it’s trying to convey. In the same way Chise treasures the book after having had her life changed, the viewer is supposed to treasure her change in lifestyle using the dark past as a basis and not as the main aspect to the OVA. What’s important isn’t  what’s in the past, it’s what’s about to come.<br />
<br />
Another big appeal is definitely the sound and visuals. The way it dulls down the colors whenever it’s a scene in the apartment compared to how lush the greenery looks during the library scenes or the comfy and warm colors used when she’s living at Ains’ house convey a lot about how she feels like she is happier when at those places. It sparingly uses music, like for parts where the colors are enough to convey whatever needs to be conveyed, but for parts like some scenes where the librarian talks to her, the piano keys perfectly match whatever’s going on onscreen. Seeing Chise’s bright red hair contrast with the foliage is very pleasing to the eyes and makes the scenes where her hair color’s muddled with the background to help convey her anxiety much more meaningful. The biggest highlight is definitely the scene where the librarian reads her the story: weaving together the book’s moral with the star imagery and what she was going through with what she will one day find, supported by one of the few times the music uses multiple instruments rather than just a piano to elevate the scene into something memorable, it’s just such a powerful scene, lives up to being the reason why she’s telling this story in the present day about why the book means so much to her.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it’s pretty much just a sneak peek for the upcoming tv anime, but it’s very reassuring to know that the adaptation will try its best to portray the wonders of magic of its world and the relationship between the two mains and the baggage they each carry.

    (Do note that despite only having watched a single episode at the release of this review, I have read the manga up to date, and can affirm that the series isnt too faithful to the manga, probably due the lack of allocated episodes. Nonetheless, I do wish to give my best attempt at a decent review, with minimum spoilers as possible! Thank you! :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Remember the Disney films you watched in your adolescence? That youthful charm of curiosity and fresh budding imagination made you awe at the simple magic potrayed in those animations. How they would soar above the night skies of britain and charmingly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228943">
        adorable talking animals. Past that age, we all fall into the abyss of reality, and start to neglect those childish desires. For all, I would reccomend Mahou Tuskai no Yume, to relive those cherised moments of innocence and be carrassed by waves of nostalgia. <br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
(One might wish to note that the story in the OVA deviates slightly from the manga) <br />
The story revolves about a seemingly aloof girl named Chise, and her adaption towards the seemingly anew yet wonderous fantasy side of the world. Coupled with her guardian, or husband Elias, the plot depicts their involvement with magic, the joys it brings and the misfortunes aa well. Magical terminologies are widespread in the anime and manga,  and you will soon notice some charming similarities from the fantasy genre novels you read, or old bed time tales passed down through your traditions to come. Certainly, it makes for an appleasing appeal to the widespread audience. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The artstyle of this anime is fairly typical, and does not deviate far from its parent manga. However, it is neither innovating or inspiring and yet, I personally found the simple art to be a charm of its rustic and serene atmosphere itself. Considering it to be an just an OVA, the production quality is surprisingly outstanding<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
I really love the character development, and the effort made here. Just into the first episide, theres already incredible depth given to our main character, Chise. Theres little characters in the series, and the main focus revolves solely on Chise and Elias. Yet, it manages to craft a hauntingly beautiful story between them, and really breaths life and personalities into them. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8 <br />
Remember the alluring Disney songs you heard from young, those enchanting combinations of notes that mellows your heart and soul. The OST used here are similar as such, simply tantalising.<br />
<br />
Overall, Mahou Tsukai mo Yume proved to be a great anime, and its such a shame to be only of 3 episodes in length. It has much potential, and I, midn the cliche, do wish upon a star that there will be a actaul series. <br />

    Story - 6<br />
<br />
Coming from someone who loves the manga very much this first episode was just... I don&#039;t know maybe disappointing. I guess I was expecting more of an adaptation then a back story that isnt shown in the manga at all. If you&#039;ve never read the manga this will just seem so aimless. You won&#039;t know any of the characters what a Slay Vega is, why Chise is with Elias.. heck it doesnt even seem like this has a plot at all!<br />
<br />
Art - 10 (9.5)<br />
<br />
Mahoutsukai honestly looks amazing, the colors, the flow, just it&#039;s great. Very beautiful. The only problem I had with it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228980">
        is that NO ONE BLINKS OML<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
<br />
The sound track fits very well it kind of reminds me of Cinderella or Snow White. The ending song was so pretty <br />
<br />
Character - 5<br />
<br />
I know it has only been one episode but sheesh anyone who hasnt read the manga would be utterly lost. You don&#039;t know anything about the characters and they  seem so stereotypical it&#039;s ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
<br />
I just had a hard time liking this. The main parts that make an anime good (imo) are lacking in this anime. The story isn&#039;t established, the characters don&#039;t have any purpose or goals they are just... there.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6<br />
<br />
Putting myself in someone&#039;s who hasnt read the manga shoes this would be such a waste of time to watch and they would be so confused. So if you want to watch this I suggest check out the first 7 or 8 chapters of the manga first. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is my first review &gt;,&lt;<br />

    Spoiler free review<br />
<br />
So The Ancient Magus&#039; Bride is a show I&#039;m eagerly waiting for when Fall 2017 finally decides to arrive. I have not touched the manga so I knew little about it, but the synopsis and the magical elements piqued my interest enough to check out this prequel OVA that took a year to finish airing 3 eps. After finishing it, I&#039;m not exactly sure why this was necessary.<br />
<br />
The plot is simply a back story to the main girl Chise Hatori, seeing what her life was like as a child way before she found the world of magic. The drama shown during these episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257225">
        are pretty standard, we&#039;ve all seen the same type of scenario before. You have the struggles of a strange and lonely orphan trying to find a place to call home, (The Ugly Duckling) and the forsaken love of a mysterious librarian. (similar to The Little Mermaid, and no not the happy Disney version) To be honest, this didn&#039;t do much to get me invested into the main series, as it felt kinda pointless to see the past of these characters that I have never met before I&#039;ve actually gotten to know more about them. There is not given much reason to actually care about Chise, you’re just suddenly given a character that you&#039;re supposed to like and feel sorry for. This may have been enough for some people to care about her, say they have read the source and/or are able to relate to her as a character, but I personally feel that I needed to see more from Chise before I could actually see her as someone I should harbour feelings towards. Maybe if I had read the manga I would have enjoyed it more, but as someone that&#039;s never watched or read anything else from the series, I&#039;m just left with a lacklustre taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend watching this after the main series is finished airing or at least reading a decent amount of the manga, it might have been more impactful if I had actually gotten to know who these people are before delving into their previous lives. As something to start off an anime adaptation, I enjoyed the experience but I&#039;m not too impressed with this OVA.<br />
<br />
Send feedback if you have any, thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts on this!

    It was a beautiful story although it only lasted for three episodes. Keep in mind that there&#039;s a full length series coming this October. I&#039;ve never read the manga and I don&#039;t intend to read until the I&#039;ve finished watching the upcoming anime series. So, in this review, I&#039;ll only be talking about what I think only from watching the OVA.<br />
<br />
Story(8/10)<br />
The story was beautiful. If you haven&#039;t read the manga, you&#039;ll be kinda confused at first but not that much. As far as I see, the OVA mainly focus on Chise&#039;s backstory. And I have to say, it was very good. From the first episode,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257240">
        it might seem like it&#039;s very slow paced but the main story kicks in starting from the second episode. And the pacing and the story matches very well. And at the of the 3rd episode, it might make some people teary.<br />
<br />
Art(9/10)<br />
There&#039;s nothing really I can say about it except it was amazing. The characters look good and sceneries are breath taking. But I can&#039;t help but feel that they could have done a little better considering this was made by the same studio which took part in production of Attack on Titan anime.<br />
<br />
Sound(7/10)<br />
The sound tracks did&#039;t stood out that much but I have to say, it matches the story and setting very well. And he sound track did make the anime more beautiful.<br />
<br />
Character(8/10)<br />
The characters are pretty awesome. You won&#039;t see any of the character archetypes that you often see in other animes. But each characters were charming in their own way.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(10/10)<br />
What can I really say apart from that it was really awesome. I waited for 1 and a half years for these 3 episodes and I&#039;d say it was worth the wait. It was everything I hoped it to be and even more.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
Overall, this is a kind of anime that you won&#039;t really find that often. And it&#039;s still just an OVA and there&#039;ll be a full length anime series coming October. It might take the anime fandom by a storm or it might become a hidden Ruby among the anime fandom. These 3 episodes were conducted really well and makes me hyped for the upcoming series.

    *some spoilers for Mahoutsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito*<br />
<br />
Literature is an interesting, often captivating medium, filled with immaculate descriptions, and exciting worlds to explore with your imagination as you read the carefully thought out words of an author who built that portal for your mind. Some may say that with the advent of animation and film becoming truly mainstream, that literature has become someone of an under-appreciated medium.<br />
<br />
The Mahoutsukai no Yome OVA, above all else, is a tragic yet pleasant reminder of the power of a story, especially the power it has on a child. Falling just shy of true greatness, it manages to still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257326">
        achieve dramatic tension and absolute pleasantry, seeping into captivation. It&#039;s a major appeal of literature, especially for a child, in which this OVA captures greatly. <br />
<br />
As you know, this OVA is a prologue about the childhood of Chise, and it&#039;s a pretty tragic one, showing pretty well how Chise became the more reserved and quiet girl we knew today. She’s a decently strong protagonist facing a ton of childhood hardship due to what she sees and the isolation and scorn that comes of it, and it&#039;s tough to see her become so melancholy to the point where it seems like she may snap into tears at any moment, which she only does when something happy occurs in her life. Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t show how she came into her current residence or how she began the study of magic, and given that this is a world in which magic still exists despite many people living without seeing magic or magical creatures, we never actually see any magic. Regardless, it&#039;s still a decently bittersweet tale, especially when Chise meets Riichi, a decent character/man who still struggles with guilt and anxiety over his promise and always wants the door closed to keep certain dark creatures away. You can tell how this ends.<br />
<br />
None of the other characters get a chance to really shine thanks to the time limitations of this OVA, but for what they were, they were decently pleasant additions (especially the ever-wise Elias and Silky, who keeps an annoyed state when her food is neglected), though as you’ll see soon, I find the best partly these characters to be the lovely character designs. Still, Chise carries this narrative on her unfortunate shoulders, as we see things from her perspective given that she narrates the bulk of the story to the cast. Yet we see some things from when she is asleep at some points, which is odd. I do have a few other minor gripes. Riichi saying his last words after being bitten borderline in half wrings hollow in this scene due to the fact that it’s insanely convenient. I heard someone say that this means he died a long time ago given the current age of the person he made a promise to, so his spirit was trapped in the library. However things are so unclear that he may as well have just gained immortality (the kind that can be revoked by being killed), and given that he interacts with the physical realm still, that seems more plausible, if still unclear. Also, how come Riichi’s and Chise’s eyes grow red when reading? If it&#039;s meant to be conveyed that they&#039;re emotionally unstable, not only was that already cleared up beforehand, but it is in and of itself a bit hamfisted, especially thanks to that. If no, we don&#039;t know why. There are a few other minor ones but I forgot them, so meh.<br />
<br />
Again, let me make it clear that none of these are major gripes but they do add up and prevent this story from truly reaching the greatness it could&#039;ve had. It&#039;s still an emotionally resonant narrative with a nice protagonist and an ability to captivate us, so don&#039;t try to make it out to be that I find the story bad, but even with the very limited time it had, it could&#039;ve done more. I can definitely forgive a few things thanks to this insanely limited run and the fact that it is ultimately a prologue. So, what else made the narrative captivating other than the protagonist and emotional resonance? Well, that should be quite obvious, dear viewers…<br />
<br />
WIT Studio was the main team in charge of this production and it looks really nice. The character designs are fantastic, with special mention going to the designs of Elias, Angelica, and Chise. The visuals are certainly captivating not due to the admittedly solid animation or the CGI furniture that only looks ok, but for the designs of everything from the creatures to the characters. The water fairies, in particular, are wonderful designs and again the actual character designs adapted by Hitotaka Hatou and done by Kore Yamazaki look lovely as well. The environments are also very pleasant to look at, especially in the scene where Riichi reads the picture book Chise treasures and we see all sorts of stars and galaxies in the sky. This, above all else really drew me in when watching, making an already sort of nice viewing experience that much better.<br />
<br />
The background OST is a pretty nice one that has decently pleasant, sometimes softly melancholic music, all of which fit rather well with the scenarios at hand, even if none of them are inherently standout tracks. There is also no OP theme, which felt weird, but the ED theme, “CLOCKWORK QUICK AND LIGHTNING SLOW&quot; by Julia Shortreed, fits this exact same description as the rest of the tracks, so it&#039;s not very memorable, but it&#039;s decently melancholic. <br />
<br />
Like a good book, this anime drew me in. While it regrettably falls short from true greatness, even taking its inherent nature into account, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable anime to watch. As per its role, it made me eagerly anticipate the main body title that would follow this work. For doing it so gracefully, I commend this short series.

    A distinctive feature of the all OVA series is the original plot, which in no way relate to the main picture. Thanks to this format, the author is able to reveal the main characters of the series and allow the viewer to plunge deeper into the universe, showing the latter some interesting aspects of the created world.<br />
<br />
Initially, Mahoutsukai no Yome is a manga, authored by Kore Yamazaki, whose publication began in November 2013 in the Magly Publishing House Monthly Comic Blade.<br />
<br />
The fifth volume of the manga announced the release of an anime prequel consisting of three episodes, Mahou Tsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314740">
        creation of anime was taken by Wit Studio. The series was sold on discs along with limited editions of the sixth, seventh and eighth volumes of the manga. The first series was also shown in cinemas for two weeks, starting on August 13, 2016. Let us dwell on this prequel in more detail.<br />
<br />
The addition to the limited editions of the 6-8 volumes of the original manga tells about some events that took place before the meeting of Chise and Elias.<br />
<br />
The action takes place in the modern world, where secretly from people there are spirits, dragons, fairies with which wizards, sorcerers and alchemists can contact. However, due to the urbanization of the earth&#039;s population, deforestation and the growth of the human population, the number of fairies is steadily declining, and for some reason wizards are on the verge of extinction.<br />
<br />
The powerful ancient magician Elias Ainsworth buys at an auction for a huge sum of money the fifteen-year-old Chise Hatori, a girl with great magical powers, so that she becomes his student and bride.<br />
<br />
So, Chise Hatori lived a life that was filled with alienation and violence, and also deprived of any form of love and care. Without family care and affection, the girl experienced all the hardships of life. Gifted by nature with magic, a girl once stumbles upon a mysterious library in the middle of a forest in which she meets a person like her, he also sees strange creatures and invites her to visit the library “every day if you like”, following some rules. Chise really begins to often come to the library, she enjoys reading and, after a while, she has less and less books to read, which is why she finds a strange book and asks the caretaker about it. Later it turns out that the man from the library was supposed to give this book to his beloved, but died while performing such a complex assignment. This is the main storehouse and source of the plot, and, in combination, the main collapse of the series.<br />
<br />
The fact is that the drama in the plot is based on the absurd and stupid actions of the library supervisor called Riichi Miura. At first, his death can give some drama to the series, but in the final episode we will learn his story, and it makes you despise and laugh at this character rather than empathize with him. The same feelings are caused by his beloved Mayumi Niikura, for the sake of which he tried to fulfill his promise. She says that she “loves the last pages of the book most of all”, hinting that she does not love her future husband. Moreover, she makes an appointment on the platform where her new lover should bring the book. In this case, it becomes very interesting what was the number of her future husbands in the list of her suitors, and how much her nature is false, if she could go so far with a person whom, in her own words, she does not love so much that she is ready to leave for another man almost from the wedding crown. I rule out a forced marriage, since the actions of the two heroes took place not so long ago, in addition, Chise finds Mayumi old at the end of the series and she already has grandchildren. Also of particular note is the stupid death of Riichi Miura. It is extremely curious why he chose the way to the station through the forest with ditches, into which he safely fell and died in it. Obviously, this is one of the most stupid deaths that I have observed in the modern anime industry.<br />
<br />
In the end, we have a stupid, nerdy, clumsy, awkward hero who wants to meet a married woman. Hero who has been stupidly (but deservedly) dead in a ditch, while carrying out the usual request to return the book. And the shameless harlot, a wife who wants to leave her future husband, spit on all concepts of morality. Empathizing with these characters is very difficult.<br />
<br />
In all stories, plots, films, books, if the author pursues a goal so that to his heroes sympathize, feel sorry and worry about them, then the latter must be done in such a way that the observer can see in them a piece of a real living person, a particle of himself or Something like that. The character must be in a stalemate situation in which there are no simple solutions, only then it becomes really exciting for their fate. But when my gaze is offered the fate of a whore, who did not have another love affair due to an unfortunate (and very absurd) case with a stupid man, it becomes not interesting for me to watch this.<br />
<br />
As a result, the last scenes evoke an absurd laugh rather than a sad smile.<br />

    The premise of the story is how Chise eventually ended up in Elias’ care during the beginning of the manga series. However, because the story starts at some undefined point after that, to tie it into the source materials, it has to be framed in a way that sounds both natural and fitting for the setting. So, in order to allow us to get a feel for the characters, it’s framed through the medium of a story told to Elias by Chise upon finding a book she receives from Angelica Barlei, the woman we see at the beginning of the video.<br />
<br />
The setting, as far as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229175">
        we can tell, is set in the modern time-period. Magical creatures, magus, and other otherworldly things exist alongside buildings, cities, and the usual trappings of society. <br />
<br />
The characters of the story are somewhat hamstrung by the premise, namely that Chise is the primary protagonist while everyone else is basically a secondary character. Because of this, it’s… relatively hard to get a strong feel for the other characters. <br />
<br />
The animation quite pleasing to the eyes, with no major hiccups that you’d find in some longer-running series. As for the music, I’m not an expert but even I can tell that it fit splendidly. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is a fairly decent production and a visually pleasing entry into the series’ franchise that I find myself fond of. However, because the expected audience are readers of the manga series, this isn’t exactly newcomer-friendly in regards to the characters and setting. You really will have to read the source materials to get to know the facts better.<br />
<br />
That being said, if you are a curious fan of the Supernatural or Slice-of-Life genres and haven’t read the series yet, this is your ticket into seeing a tiny bit of what’s in store for you and should be watched.

    -Spoiler free review-<br />
I wouldn&#039;t usually feel the need to write a review, but the helpful reviews (at the time of writing this) are around the 6/7 mark. This OVA is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. I will start off by saying I&#039;ve never read the manga, and the fully adapted anime is to be released shortly. Even with no prior reading I believe this show stands by itself fantastically, portraying a beautiful story with an almost Ghibli vibe.<br />
<br />
Story(9/10)<br />
What a beautiful story is was, endearing from start to finish. The premise of the story was very easy to grasp, and there was no need for any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257269">
        prior knowledge to understand what was happening in the mc&#039;s (Chise&#039;s) life. The pacing is slow, but perfectly suited for the OVAs content. This pacing allows the viewer to fully absorb the beautiful world created infront of you, and it gives the viewer time to become emotionally invested in the characters. This emotional attatchment stems from the themes covered by the OVA, with themes such as loneliness, family and loss being hugely relatable to me on a personal level and Im sure many of you can relate to these themes. The story does touch on some overused classic &quot;sob stories&quot; to set up Chise&#039;s past, however, the portrayal of the influence these events on Chise have are beyond any anime Ive ever seen and the execution of these scenes are done perfectly.<br />
<br />
Art(10/10)<br />
It can easily be seen just how much time has been invested into making this one of the most visually stunning OVAs/animes I have ever seen. From the very first scene the art sets the standards high, and only improves from then on. This can especially be seen in particular highlight moments in episodes 2/3, where the art style compliments the story beautifully, bringing the whole OVA together as one.<br />
<br />
Sound(9/10)<br />
Personally, I found the sound track to compliment the OVA almost perfectly. I noticed almost every piece of music when it started, and I would say it managed to bring many scenes together beautifully. The soundtrack itself is not there to act as the centre of attention, it is there to reinforce the beautiful story and art and give a nice emotional touch (that might even tear you up) in many pivotal scenes. <br />
<br />
Character(9/10)<br />
The characters are fantastically made, with a deep intruiging backstory for Chise. The librarian&#039;s character is also incredibly well done, with his mentality and struggles being portrayed perfectly. There are, however, some virtually untouched characters due to the short length of the OVA. The only one of these I found to be an issue was the dog, with the skull-guy and the pink-girly being incredibly well introduced considering how little they feature. The dog, however, was not well done- so perhaps the anime (or manga) needs to be watched/read to do this character justice.<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10)<br />
This anime is a masterpiece, it will play with your emotions at many points throughout, and will leave you wanting more from this beautiful world. And good news! More is coming! I can only hope that the anime will do the OVA justice- especially in the art department- as it has set the bar high. If you were looking for a Ghibli-esque fantasy world and an emotional journey, youve found the right OVA!<br />

    There&#039;s hardly much to say about this series, it&#039;s gonna be 3 episodes long, shows a lot of promise and I can only wish it becomes more than just an OVA. Characters are lovely, there&#039;s this supernatural-ish air to it which is a genre I thoroughly enjoy, mixed up with a bit of magic, another genre I also like. The matchup between both genres is not something that you see every single season, or at least not in such an above average presentation. Great direction and top tier sound edition, along with the very charismatic and mysterious characters makes the OVA a must watch that

    From the very beginning this anime draws you in with it&#039;s beautiful art style, regardless of being an artist or not the smooth details and bright colour are bound to entice you. I watched this series from the first episode airing to waiting 6+ months for each new episode. Even now as I completed episode 3 I am left with teary eyes for it. Sadly the story does take a back seat in this case because you are more likely to continue watching due to the art and music. The artwork and music really show why it took 6 months to make however the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257400">
        are not bland either. The characters stories are really touching in conveying their emotions to everyone&#039;s individual circumstance. In 3 episodes I was brought to tears twice due to Chise&#039;s series of unfortunate events. The show has made me very interested in the manga and I am not a big manga reader. I really recommend a series like this to anyone who loves art and aspires to be an artist. It also holds a rare spot of being a 10 for me.

    In my review about this anime I said that It wasn&#039;t a masterpiece however there were a lot of elements  do a second season that can become a master piece and this OWA is a clear demonstration of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the OWA giving me a better connection with the protagonist and also it clarified many questions if the whole anime.<br />
<br />
In general the great problem with this anime is that the creators had overload this anime and there are many things with no conclusion. I thing this OWA comes to help to mitigate that overload and really I hope a second season.<br />
<br />

    My opinion:<br />
<br />
A pretty prequel OVA expanding on the backstory of the heroine Chise. Although it does work as a standalone, the story mainly consists of an array of tropes you’ve probably seen a dozen times already, resulting in an unsatisfying experience if watched as a standalone. But the OVA does contain a few glimpes of greatness that we’ll hopefully see more of in the main series, namely the Slice of Life-sequences interwoven with a peaceful blend of magic and very sweet and light humor.<br />
<br />
[Warning: The rest of this review contains spoilers!]<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The main part of the OVA consists of Chise’s “backstory” which unmistakably resembles Natsume Yuujinchou,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257238">
        by like a lot. The story also runs parallel to the story of the book that starts this whole ordeal, which can be divided into three parts:<br />
<br />
 Chise can see what I assume are magical beings, and she is terrified by them. Her mother ends up killing herself, those in the family taking her in want her to disappear. All because she can see things that others can’t. <br />
The lonely star in the night sky is all alone in the darkness, sad and in despair.<br />
<br />
She stumbles upon a library, books are her escape from reality. While Chise is often shown looking down on the ground, she gradually opens up and starts looking upwards, she learns to “see the light” so to speak, although she doesn’t yet acknowledge it. The librarian first shows her that she can find light, similar to the being talking to the lonely star.<br />
<br />
The third and final part of the book is the part that Chise does not end up reading, the part where the lonely star assumedly finally opens his eyes and starts looking for and finding friends. However, as we have seen earlier (and will again see later), she has found a new home and new hope.<br />
<br />
It’s really a simple story, a story of a tragic heroine that runs parallel to the story of a book the protagonist once read and ends up finding again, which marks the end of the story.<br />
I have seen this story done many times, especially in Manga, and I assume most of you will have, too. While simple, it does it’s job which is fine, but honestly the OVA goes a little hard on the “tragic heroine”, to a degree that can be annoying at times.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Sadly, I have neither read the manga nor seen the main series (which has not yet aired) before watching this. As a result, the characters are all fairly flat and while it’s easy to get the general gist of the relationships of the characters, I think knowing more about the heroine Chise would have been beneficial, as there definitely is a fair amount of character progression between the younger Chise and the adolescent Chise we see during this show’s runtime. This very much is a Chise OVA. None of the other characters are developed further than a necessary point, which is a shame but understandable since this is just a supplementary OVA.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
<br />
The main strength of this OVA is it’s usage of color as a storytelling tool.<br />
The coloring doesn’t just support the scene like it usually does, it takes centerstage in the show’s emotionally strongest moments which I’m eager to see more of.<br />
As this is a tragic heroine story, the shoujo-esque art style is very fitting, but it isn’t necessarily anything groundbreaking.<br />
<br />
There isn’t much animation to speak of in this OVA. Most of the time it’s just a mix of panning techniques and zooming several layers at different speeds to create the sensation of movement. When there is animation however, it’s mostly just three to four frames of eyes glimmering, shining, whatever you wanna call it.<br />
The few times where there actually is something animated, it looks really crisp and fluid.<br />
<br />
That being said, the cinematography overall is quite strong which I hope will translate to the main series as well.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
<br />
As usual for anime and audiovisual media in general, the music takes more of a supporting role.<br />
Standout moments are those where the background music is absent. When the music constantly and calmly supports the show all the way and suddenly it is missing, it is very noticeable and creates a feeling of uneasiness which works wonders. Unfortunately, the rest of the music isn’t noteworthy. There are no standout pieces, and all of the pieces would work in any other series trying to convey the same emotions, which is a shame.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Watch this as a supplementary OVA either while watching or after completing the main series. While it works as a standalone, it is definitely carried by the contrast of young Chise from this OVA and adolescent Chise from the main series.<br />

    The Ancient Magus&#039; Bride is a Japanese fantasy shounen manga series written and illustrated by Kore Yamazaki. (Frau Faust, Futari no Renai Shoka). The series is published in Japan by Mag Garden in its Monthly Comic Garden magazine. The manga is also licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. Wit Studio produced a three-part prequel OVA of the manga, and an anime television series is currently airing. <br />
<br />
Mahoutsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito follows Chise Hatori, a 15 years old girl. Being absolutely alone and having no place to go, the girl is bought for money by a non-human mage named Elias. Having seen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268032">
        the unpleasant part of life, the girl finds herself in a new family. To her big surprise, she is now Elias’ apprentice, as well as his future wife. Chise enjoys her new peaceful life, when she suddenly receives a book from her past, which introduces us to her tragic backstory. This piece is a prequel to Chise’s encounter with the Thorn Sorcerer.<br />
<br />
Having read plot’s summary it might be too difficult for one to understand the anime’s main idea and it is close to impossible to do so, because Mahoutsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito is a backstory and shows only Chise’s childhood. You will be shown her tragic childhood and you will not get an idea of what is going to happen in the anime’s TV series, which is currently airing. Anyways, enough with that long introduction. This OAV did a good job explaining most of the needed for Chise’s story things; yet, there is still a great deal of questions that should be answered. But let us give the TV series an opportunity to answer these questions.<br />
<br />
The real magic of this anime, of course, is its visuals and soundtrack. Do not get me wrong, it is not the only gem of this anime. Anyways, the anime’s visuals amazingly help the viewer find themselves in a very beautiful, but also in very dramatic fairytale. I would describe Mahoutsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito as an anime somewhat similar to Ghibli pieces, but more realistic and perhaps even more dramatic. Sound wise, the anime also does its job introducing the viewer to this piece. Not only the OST, but also characters did simply an amazing job. <br />
<br />
Character wise, the OAV focuses on Chise’s backstory. She is the main character and the titular character of the story. Her existence can be described as an unwanted child that should just have stopped its existence. Yet, Chise is not just a child, because she is able to see what other humans cannot; this supernatural power does not give her happiness only grief and harm. <br />
<br />
That said, taking into consideration the fact that this OAV only introduces us to the story of the main series, I have to say that it does its job pretty well. Please do not think that this anime is a pure romance, harem, or anything else. (It has nothing to do with harem, though). Indeed, the anime’s synopsis screams that there should be romance, but everything is not that easy. The Ancient Magus&#039; Bride OAV is an excellent prequel to the TV anime’s series that will introduce you to a heartbreaking story of a future sorcerer Chise. <br />
<br />
Overall, I give this prequel a very weak 10/10. As a prequel, it is simply near-flawless. It has been awhile since I last saw such beautiful and tragic fairytale, with a grain of realism, too. I highly recommend this masterpiece for all anime fans. It might be; however, boring, but, please, do be patient and you will be rewarded.

    魔法使いの嫁 星待つひと - Mahoutsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito, the OVA gives a touching insight into the world of the protagonist Hatori, Chise. Although the Slice of Life begins tragically, you will be deeply moved by the portrayal of her childhood as an orphan.<br />
<br />
Story: tragic but beautiful, good pacing, so that the viewer can follow the plot well (9/10)<br />
It begins differently than expected, which is due to the fact that the story does not appear in the manga. If you&#039;re open to the story, you&#039;ll enjoy it, whether you&#039;re familiar with the manga by Yamazaki, Kore or not. I like it because the story reminds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294989">
        me of famous literature such as Charles Dickens &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or the Novel &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; by the author Michael Ende and even the play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (later better known as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;) by George Bernard Shaw.<br />
The story begins pleasantly in foggy London and the first person we will meet is the witch Angelica Barley. She is a technician of the Magus Craft and runs a workshop that deals with magical tools. Her little helper Hugo belongs to the genus Vodyanoi or water fairies. The package they prepare includes a special gift. When the parcel arrives at its destination, the country estate of the sorcerer Elias Ainsworth, somewhere in the western sub-region of London, it is the sparking for a flashback, which is revealing Chises forgotten memories. That is the world into which these three episodes want to take us.<br />
<br />
Characterizations: well done but too short to flesh out all characters (8/10)<br />
Although you do not know how it all came about, the behavior of the characters is appropriate, self-contained and intelligible.<br />
Chise as a little orphan is a good example. Her behavior as someone who is alone and does not get help from someone because nobody understands, or even just wants to listen her. But the encounter with Riichi Miura is changing Chise`s world. He is the librarian and welcomes Chise at the Library of the Forest. Miura has a gentle personality, a bit clumsy but kind and sincere. By the way, the Library of the Forest, as Elias points out, is based on a real Japanese folklore called Mayoiga, which can be read in the &quot;Legends of Tono&quot; by Kunio Yanagita. You may need a little patience but your benefit will be a wonderful and touching story. Three episodes, while not sufficient to fully fleshed out all characters but the description of Chise and Elias does a good job of making them both understand- and likable. Furthermore, it kindles the desire to discover more about their relationship and the other characters. If you would like to know more about the characters featured in this OVA, you may be interested in my review of the television series Mahoutsukai no Yome.<br />
<br />
Visuals: The quality of art &amp; animation is just beautiful and a pleasure to see (9/10)<br />
Art and animation are very appealing to the eye, one reason for this is certainly that all the art department staff are very experienced. The art directing was done by Takeda, Yusuke, if you have already seen: Shirobako, Eden of the East or GitS - Arise, then you are already familiar with his works. The artwork impresses with beautiful and detailed backgrounds such as the Forest Library and excellent as well as expressive character designs. Just a small thing but I like the increase in colour and brightness in situations where the plot puts Chise in a more beautiful scenario. This reflects her emotional condition. You will certainly find similarities to other famous anime but there are also some aspects which are relating to the qualities of Studio Ghibli. However, this is not as far-fetched as it seems at first glance. On the one hand, Tamura, Seiki is one of the art designers, he was a background artist for Princess Mononoke. On the other hand, there is the mysterious creature with a shadow-like body (in this case built up on mice) that is wearing a mask. You certainly know the creature from &quot;Sen and Chihiro&#039;s Spiriting Away&quot;, which is called &quot;No-Face&quot;. CG is usually not my cup of tea, but surprisingly, it has been very attractively implemented here. What matters is not whether CG was used, but how. There are ways to implement CG very well. The art and animation of this show are simply beautiful to look at.<br />
<br />
Sounds: beautiful, supportive, emphasizing and appealing (9/10)<br />
The music does a good job of underlining the atmosphere. For example, I liked the scene in which Angelika begins to prepare a packet, and while she delves into a conversation with Hugo, the orchestral symphonic BGM gently begins. The music increases smoothly and is complemented by some sound effects - in this case by air bubbles and ripples of water. This scenario is also funny because by Anglica`s own interference, the BGM stops. Only a minor feature, but I like such things and also that the voice performance is not interfered by the music, but emphasizes each other.<br />
The Voice acting leaves nothing to be desired. I especially liked the voice of Angelica, which is given to the character by Kaida, Yuuko. Her voice is a little deeper and beautifully clear.<br />
<br />
A beautiful and very rare case of an splendid realization that combines the professionalism of understanding the story, its characters and a carefully imaginative adaptation of the very beautiful source material. All in all a wonderful introduction to the world of &quot;The Ancient Magus Bride&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and have fun watching.

    NO SPOILERS<br />
<br />
!!! I HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT watch this OVA before reading the manga or watching the anime (after it&#039;s completed). Doing so will probably leave you confused and discouraged to get into the series. !!!<br />
<br />
One fairly common complaint I&#039;ve seen is that this OVA doesn&#039;t explain much of what&#039;s even going on. It&#039;s not meant to. It&#039;s a prequel meant for those already familiar with the characters and the world to enjoy. Of course, there are many people who would enjoy the OVA without needing any background knowledge, but others, like myself, would have trouble appreciating many aspects of the story without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268843">
        some prior knowledge.<br />
<br />
I watched the anime (14 episodes have been aired so far at the time of writing this) and read the manga before watching this, and I totally enjoyed it. I think people who were put off by this OVA should read through some chapters of the manga and watch through some episodes of the anime, hopefully getting more into the story, then revisit this OVA. It should become more apparent that this OVA wasn&#039;t meant for people unfamiliar with the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY- 8<br />
It&#039;s pretty amazing how magical this series actually feels. This OVA in particular gives of some strong Spirited Away vibes. Seriously, just watch it and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
The OVA elaborates on some of the events in Chise&#039;s past that isn&#039;t in the manga. From my understanding, Kore Yamazaki still had a large role in the conception of this story. A very satisfying side story for fans of the series, though it can be just as captivating for first time viewers. I would understand if a first time viewer would find the premise of the OVA a bit cliche, so I&#039;m still very much in favor of getting familiar the with source material first.<br />
<br />
There were some parts of the story that did seem a bit confusing and silly even for me, but I won&#039;t go much into those because it might invite some spoilers.<br />
<br />
ART/SOUND- 10<br />
The art style is distinct and definitely my type. The animation is fluid. Just like this anime, it gives off a wonderful Ghibli vibe.<br />
The soundtrack aids the visuals in giving off a sense of wonder.<br />
<br />
Character- 10<br />
Chise is such a complicated yet still very likable character. (I absolutely love her but that just me). Her complexity is more apparent with familiarity of the source material of course. This OVA serves as thorough explanation for her behavior and beliefs in the series. Her development can be seen as too slow or stagnant by others, but seeing what she went through in this OVA can provide a deeper understanding of her motives and such.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 10<br />
I love this series! I only got into it less than two weeks ago, and I love it to the point where I&#039;m willing to write a review on it.<br />
<br />
Overall- 9<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the manga, watch this OVA.<br />
If you&#039;ve never delved into the manga or anime but love fantasy and magical worlds, you might really enjoy this OVA anyway.

    I&#039;d like to start this review by saying that this anime is neither a direct adaptation of the manga, nor a condensed retelling. This is a continuation of the story introduced in the manga of the same name. It is a flashback to a time before the manga started and, technically, is therefore a sort of prologue. However, if the viewer has never read the manga, or is looking to get an idea of what it may hold, they will be missing out on quite a few details. While I do NOT believe that this in any way detracts from the viewers experience, I thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237815">
        it should be said. The purpose of this anime is to generate interest in the story told in the manga, and I believe it does that quite well.<br />
<br />
Also, as of this writing, only the first episode has aired. This review will be updated as the other episodes are released.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
<br />
This story picks up a good ways into the manga, as some aspects of it (characters, items, setting) are already considered to be common knowledge. While I feel that leaves a bit of a lacking feeling to those brand new to the series, I believe it creates an attractive aura of mystery that will draw those viewers to seek out the manga. The script does a good job of touching on each aspect of what this anime is supposed to encompass. Discovery of a fae style of fantasy, a slice of life within said fantasy, and, finally, a romance. Within such a short episode each of these aspects is touched on and given equal presence.<br />
<br />
While short, this story hooks you quick and leaves you ready to devour more. While there might not be much more to see yet, it instead allows us to dream and fantasize about what may come next.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
<br />
The art of this anime is the absolute best part of this show. I have seen it describe as similar to that of Studio Ghibli, and while I don&#039;t quite agree one hundred percent with that, I&#039;d certainly stand this next to it as a contender. The artist is able to evoke incredibly intense mood changes with just how the backgrounds are drawn in. From a warm and homey feeling, to tense, almost hostile stand-offishness, to a panicked need to get away, to child-like wonder. The art portrayed pulls these emotions from us as easily as a pianist pulls notes from his instrument. With the characters it falls into the use of some of the more popular anime tropes, but that&#039;s to be expected in an anime (where else would we want to find those tropes?).<br />
<br />
The animation is smooth, well drawn, and unique enough to be it&#039;s own draw to the anime. If you watch it for nothing else, let this aspect bring out that lost part of you awakened all those years ago by Ghibli. You&#039;ll be glad you did, even if just for a moment.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
<br />
This title did not have an opening song per se. It starts off with background noises, segways into the sounds that bring our attention to the immediate action, and eventually move into a song. However, that songs starts off as part of the actions going on in the show, and build to an introduction of the title screen. It&#039;s not exactly unique, but it&#039;s not often done anymore, and all the more precious because of that.<br />
<br />
The voice acting while certainly professional, didn&#039;t seem particularly strenuous to me at first. However, I was soon shown that this discrepancy was done purposefully. Again, setting that tone of excitement, building into a comfortable situation, and then building from there into a crescendo intense emotion where-upon it reaches its climax at the end.<br />
<br />
Now, while we didn&#039;t have a traditional opening, we did receive an ending. It was a sedate affair that fit in well with how the episode ended, and I would not be surprised if later episodes had a different ending song that matched better with the way they end.<br />
<br />
The sound effects used are reminiscent of shows from our childhood. I mentioned before Studio Ghibli, and now I&#039;ll take it a step further and rope in Disney as well. The uses of the sounds we see for things like magic, or something fluttering past, are not often used because they evoke that child-like innocence we believe we no longer have. However, Wit Studio has shown us here that those feelings are within our grasp, we just needed that extra push to find them.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10<br />
<br />
This category will receive my lowest score. The reason is simply because we only really see the development of one character. That being said, the development shown by this character is astounding. We see changes almost immediately from where she is now to where she was previously, and good reasoning behind most of those changes.<br />
<br />
However none of the other characters receive this treatment. You see them as they are in their current mood, and not much else. Perhaps the next few episodes will attempt something to fix this problem, but I think it will be, if at all, minor.<br />
<br />
Again, that being said, this is a flashback series, and the character development that this anime is missing is shown in the manga. So while this is my lowest score, it by no means detracts from what this project is.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
<br />
I believe many will enjoy what this is to become. I for one, will definitely be keeping an eye out for this in the future. I have read enough of the manga that I was able to enjoy the lesser known aspects of what went on in the anime, and I can honestly say I think anyone who watches this first, the reads the anime, then watches this again will probably get even more enjoyment out of it than I did.<br />
<br />
If it is within your power, then I would suggest owning a copy of both the manga and the anime. The manga is a good read with clear, concise arcs. The anime is short and light, and a good pick-me-up for when you&#039;re feeling down or confused and want to watch something light, but still captivating. The first time I watched it was about two hours ago, and I&#039;ve already seen it twice through. Believe me when I tell you it is worth having on your shelf, and worth watching again and again.<br />
<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope you enjoy this story as much as I did, and I hope this review helped you.<br />
<br />
Fair watching.

    Out of 100 Nobles watching...<br />
98 were impressed!<br />
2 Were a tad disoriented in the first 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Like many people who watched Mahoutsukai no Yome, the Hoshi Matsu Hito OVA episodes were the first taste of what this amazing piece of media had to offer. This 3 episode short is a must see and stands on it&#039;s own from its anime counterpart. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve rated this trio of OVA episodes a bit higher than the actual Mahoutsukai no Yome anime itself for a very simple reason. Timing and Direction. This anime moves slowly, but at no point in time is it ever wasting a frame. The visuals are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277593">
        filled with environmental detail earning it well deserved comparison to Ghibli movies by many and the sound design couples well with this. At no point in time is a conversation meaningless or a characters visual portrayal acting as filler. <br />
<br />
In regards to the shows story, I&#039;ll first address what every person I presented this work to said to me in the first 3 minutes of watching it. &quot;Is this the first episode or did we skip something.&quot; The initial splash of being thrown into the deep end of this magical world is really the only thing I can knock this anime&#039;s presentation for. The viewer is presented a well established &quot;norm&quot; for how the protagonist Chise is living her life which takes place in the dead center of episode 12-13 of the anime before we go into a flashback to cover the actual prequel content this OVA advertised itself as. While disorienting at first this method of story telling takes it&#039;s time to show a new viewer all the information they need to get the best picture possible of the fantasy world they are in. <br />
<br />
This anime&#039;s studio kicked the door in with a story to tell and a picture to paint and used it&#039;s allotted time to do so perfectly. The full anime provides even more of what this heartwarming and heartbreaking story has to offer albeit in a package that is slightly less tight.

    The Ancient Magus&#039; Bride: Those Awaiting a Star is a heartwarming story told by the main character, Hatori Chise who is the eponymous bride. The story presented has almost no relation to the main story which will be told in the upcoming Autumn 2017 TV anime, but is more of a sneak-peak of sorts for newcomers and a nice little bonus story for people who have read the manga.<br />
<br />
The main plot revolves around Chise telling a story about here childhood to her mentor Elias. The present day bits that exist in the episodes do a fine job of setting up the world for those who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258827">
        don&#039;t know it. The relationship between Chise and Elias is quickly covered as being that of a mentor and apprentice though in this story we see Chise take the role of the mentor. We get to briefly meet all of the characters which will be present in the main story as well.<br />
<br />
The main bulk of the story of these OVAs is in the past, in a story revolving around a library in the forest and its kind keeper. It is overall very heartwarming and well told in the time frame aloted. It&#039;s a story revolving around kindness and hope for a better tomorrow. It&#039;s very calm, though not enough that you get complacent and your mind wanders off, it feeds you just enough information about the library and the librarian Miura that you get hooked on the small mystery it builds up. This mystery element is helped by the wonderful world of magic in which the story takes place, we get to see the small black book monsters which immediately draws our intrigue, the evil spirits haunting Chise also keep us on our toes while she is out and about so the anime never gives us a moment of boredom despite it&#039;s very mellow tone.<br />
<br />
The story really manages to put you into the shoes of a small child all alone in an unfamiliar world. You don&#039;t know any more than Chise what all these monsters want. You feel bad for her when the people around her treat her poorly. You feel happy when she finds a place to retreat to with Miura, and so forth. In its rather short run it manages to create a connection with the main character that I feel most anime can&#039;t do in four times the time it had.<br />
<br />
The visuals are also top-notch. They&#039;re bright and colourful, detailed and just all around pretty to look at. Certain scenes in the anime look incredibly beautiful and while there&#039;s not a lot of animation in motion that is too impressive, the backgrounds and creatures and characters definitely are. It&#039;s amazing seeing these characters brought to life after only seeing them in still shots in a manga and I feel like this OVA perfectly captures the beautiful art of the manga.<br />
The music is great as well. With orchestral tracks that play during important moments and more quiet melodies accompanying the mellow moments of the story. All fit perfectly and accentuate what is happening perfectly.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think The Ancient Magus&#039; Bride: Those Awaiting a Star is definitely worth watching no matter if you&#039;ve read the manga beforehand or not. As I said in the beginning, if you&#039;ve already read it it&#039;s a nice bonus story and if you&#039;ve not read it it&#039;s a great way to get a sneak-peak at the kinds of stories and world the upcoming TV anime is going to contain. If you like this you&#039;re probably going to like the TV show, assuming that it&#039;s going to be anything close to how the manga is. However, I feel like that because the story is inconsequential it also lacks some of the impact it could have had. This story didn&#039;t appear in the manga after all and will not matter to the big picture. It is, in the end, just a small detour.<br />
I recommend sitting down one night by the fireplace with a nice cup of tea to watch this. It would certainly enhance the already enchanting atmosphere.
