    Story:<br />
Based around a character that wants to become an idol I really didn&#039;t expect much from this series. Starting out with that prejudice I was surprised to see new approaches in this business and was instantly drawn by this anime. Unlike other storys full of clich&amp;eacute;d stuff, our protagonist (Kyoko) isn&#039;t driven by the wish of fame, money or power as it is common. No, all she wants is revenge on her former ... well ... &amp;quot;boyfriend&amp;quot;... kind of... not. <br />
<br />
With this the anime&#039;s story thrives very much from character developement and I mean REAL character developement. Additionally it is well rounded up with a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9514">
        lot of good comedic events. <br />
But in the end it turns into an all to common basic plot: the protagonist has to overcome obstacles with hard work, just with a nice twist. Don&#039;t get me wrong, this isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. It&#039;s a solid story, just not an all to originally one. Still the added surprising elements are what makes this very good.<br />
<br />
9 points for a story with a relly nice change<br />
<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
With Kyoko, for once, we have a female lead that is independent and isn&#039;t waiting for a prince in shining armor to save her. It&#039;s pretty much the opposite, since she is already disappointed of her prince, that took her out into the big town so she could do his chores... actually that&#039;s not quite right... she came to hate the prince and wants revenge for using and playing her.<br />
<br />
Having that said, Kyoko is a rather fresh and surprising character. With her hate and her own spirits fighting each other we see a lot of her inner conflict of trying to become loved by the public and at the same time being full of hate for Shotaro. We can expect a lot more character developement.<br />
<br />
The other two male characters influencing Kyoko&#039;s new life certainly seem interesting as well. <br />
Shotaro is pretty much the guy who thinks too highly of himself and is for now the perfect guy for Kyoko&#039;s hate manifestation, but then there are times where it seems like all that Kyoko want is to be acknowledged by him.<br />
Ren on the other hand is a perfectionist, who takes his job seriously and expects others to do so as well. Since Kyoko is want to be an idol only out of revenge he certainly has a little problem with her. But judging him now wouldn&#039;t be right, since there wasn&#039;t much screentime focused on him up till now.<br />
<br />
9 points for Characters Development to look forward too<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The background music/sound often go by unnoticed, which actually might be a good thing. That is not because the music is bad, but rather because this way the watcher can focus a lot more on the story. Which in turn means it&#039;s simply not necessary to pep up the story with catchy music, because it can stand on it&#039;s own. But you gotta admit the music isn&#039;t too impressive either.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t rate the opening and ending, since that often depends on personal flavor. (okay... I do prefer the ending song ^_^)<br />
<br />
7 points for a well used and solid music<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art quality certainly is a very good one. Definetly above todays average. The characters are overall very well drawn, and the backgrounds are always fitting the context perfectly. <br />
Sadly animation quality is at very few points not at it&#039;s peak, but even then still a good one. Also sometimes the background seems a bit empty, but that&#039;s not to big of a deal since it&#039;s usually enough to carry the athmosphere.<br />
<br />
8 points for nice work from the graphics department<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
The story just makes me want to cheer Kyoko on. Damn, this girls deserves her revenge. *waves a Kyoko flag with waterfall eyes and starts shouting &amp;quot;KYOKO! KYOKO!&amp;quot;*<br />
It&#039;s not only the really interesting story, but also all the little bits which make laugh that make this anime such a great show.<br />
This anime goes even with a perfectly balanced pace, blended out of story advancement and humour.<br />
<br />
10 points for Kyoko and all the hilarious moments<br />
<br />
<br />
I for myself find me really enchanted to Kyoko and this anime. So give it a try as well. ;)<br />
<br />
9 points overall<br />

    Lovers of comedy, dynamic characters, and stories with the realistic backdrop of a dog-eat-dog show biz world, rejoice! There is a perfectly enjoyable and ultimately very satisfying anime in store for you called Skip Beat!. <br />
<br />
Skip Beat! follows the endearing young Kyoko Mogami as she travels 200-something miles across Japan to support her childhood friend Sho in his debut as a pop singer. She continues to bail him out until she finds out he&#039;s only been using her for her delicious cooking and wife-like, hardworking traits. And he&#039;s allowed to because he is THE Fuwa Sho? Kyoko doesn&#039;t think so.  <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s where the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105685">
        gets a little interesting. <br />
<br />
Unlike other female leads who might cry over numerous tubs of ice cream while re-watching their favorite soap operas, Kyoko takes this pain and suffering she&#039;s gone through and turns it into something beautiful. She uses her new-found hatred for Sho as an endless supply of fuel for her journey into the mysterious and somewhat scary world of show business. <br />
<br />
Like Kyoko, all of the characters in this anime have a reason to do what they are doing. They all have a single purpose they are trying to achieve through professions such as acting, singing or debuting in big-budget films. <br />
<br />
Because not all of the characters were there for the same reason, we as viewers are able to see some great ideology clashes and disputes that break out among this wide variety of characters. <br />
<br />
Thinking back, the sole reason why this anime was so enjoyable was the cast of wacky, memorable characters who brought a sense of purpose and bursts of life to what could have been a very stereotypical, bland and fabricated holywood-glamorized portrayal of the world of show business. This cast includes the enigmatic Tsuruga Ren, the selfishly obnoxious Fuwa Sho, the tsundere-dere &quot;Mouko&quot; and the all-knowingly eccentric LME president. While their characters may seem generic and cardboard-like at first, the story&#039;s excellent pacing and wonderful use of character interactions gives depth and meaning to each character.... <br />
<br />
even the most unlikable character becomes slightly tolerable as you learn to appreciate his existence in the anime. <br />
<br />
That being said, the characters&#039; designs were not exactly up-to-par or great. I am an artist myself and it&#039;s probably the reason why I am so particular about the aspect of art in an anime. The colors were generally very bright and one-sided, while the character designs themselves didn&#039;t stand out much. I did like the emphasis on the expressions of the characters that changed when they were acting but other than that, there was nothing much to look for. <br />
<br />
It was truly the characters themselves and the cast of seiyuu who did a fantastic job portraying their animated-counterparts that made me like this anime. <br />
<br />
The same goes for sound. Nothing was very special about the upbeat, very forgettable pop-song opening but the ending did a very nice job of capturing any left over angst and anxiety from being a victim of horrible circumstances. OST&#039;s turned out to be fine as well, mostly in the department of dramatizing an event or adding extra suspense. <br />
<br />
Lastly, I appreciated the anime&#039;s ability to create an engaging atmosphere with the audience as it tackled the tricky topic of what really goes on behind the camera. How much are we seeing of these underpaid actors who go through sleepless nights and bottles of gin to try and perfect their role?<br />
 <br />
Nothing, really. <br />
<br />
We only see their perfectly chiseled faces covered in pounds of make-up and we think, &quot;man that&#039;s the life.&quot;<br />
<br />
This anime reveals all of the ugly that actually goes on behind that makeup and perfectly lit photos while remaining professional, non-cliche and upbeat. There&#039;s no unnecessary drama, no stupid tabloid induced scandals, no fake love relationships. It could have easily gone down the reality-tv-show path of &quot;look, stars are real humans too! they eat lunch just like we do!&quot;, but it didn&#039;t, thank goodness. <br />
<br />
We empathize with these characters and their struggles and triumphs because we actually SEE what they&#039;re going through. <br />
<br />
The anime is able to give us viewers insights on their world in a very down-to-earth and realistic manner. <br />
<br />
All in all, this anime was fun and very easy to get lost in. I remember seeing it as a middle schooler thinking &quot;wow this is pretty good&quot; and now, as a more-grown-up-but-still-kinda-childish viewer, I&#039;m still thinking the same thing. If you&#039;re looking for a nice way to spend your Saturday afternoon, go ahead and watch it. I encourage you to. <br />

    We know the story of the plucky girl making it big in the glitzy world of showbiz.  It&#039;s the story of Bridget Jones, Josie, the Pussycats, and even Hanna Montana.  Skip Beat! puts a welcome spin on it, and it&#039;s not just the (fascinating) insight into the Japanese entertainment industry.  The story is consistently compelling throughout, and the surreal imagery is inventive and keeps the tone light and humorous, even as its emotions are scathingly deep.<br />
<br />
While it&#039;s not beneath the show to humiliate the characters or make them look foolish, they are complex and principled, and the show has enough compassion to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31787">
        give them their dignity.  The way it allows even its most prickly characters to learn and change feels natural, authentic and worthwhile.  It&#039;s rare to see any show about anything from anywhere as concerned with human dignity as Skip Beat! is.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s have a second season, already.

    Been quite a while since I last found a shoujo title that I genuinely enjoyed. Skip Beat focuses on the challenges faced by our lead Kyoko in trying to become a successful actress as she learns that she wants to get more out of it besides being a tool to get revenge on her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and popular musician, Sho Fuwa. Some have called the series as something of a Cinderella story and the description seems mostly accurate as we learn of Kyoko&#039;s tragic and impoverished back story and dealing with the ramifications of being abandoned by those close to her. The emotional

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167085">
        scars do affect her at the start of the series as she lacks the passion for wanting to enjoy acting at first as she only seen the profession as a means of seeking revenge on Sho. But as episodes progress, she does develop a genuine love for acting, sees it as something she feels motivated to excel in beyond her original goal of revenge and a number of episodes revolve around how Kyoko approaches a role she would be performing in.<br />
<br />
Beyond Kyoko, some other characters get focused on within the world of stardom as they come to connect with Kyoko and we learn of their own personal challenges they struggled through to get to the point where they were at within their careers. Tsuruga&#039;s character is given the more prominent focus in his interactions with Kyoko as he seemingly hates Kyoko&#039;s motivations for persuing an acting career at first, before the changes in her motivations lead him to start supporting her and developing feelings for her. The series does drop hints that Tsuruga may have a more tragic past than Kyoko and he may have known her for far longer than she thinks, but the series abruptly ends before more of these aspects to the storyline could be explored. This weakness appears to be due to the title&#039;s manga source material still being ongoing as of this review.<br />
<br />
Another issue I did find with the series at points came with its comedy. Scenes with it tend to pop up throughout a good part of the series, serving to either exaggerate on a conflict or emotional state affecting one of the characters or to lighten the mood following a rather serious development in the show&#039;s storyline. The title&#039;s comedic style was hit-or-miss for me as I had some moments where the humor focused on the former got me laughing, but others left me indifferent and usually had me feeling that they got in the way of the mood of serious scenes for the latter mentioned moments. Fortunately, the comedy does tone itself down as Kyoko&#039;s emotional state improves from adjusting positively to her new life as an actress and doesn&#039;t intrude too heavily upon later developments with her character and others.<br />
<br />
The visuals to the series are rather standard for a late 2000s anime in terms of detail and design for characters and scenery. Details are clean and bright color is used to go along with the show&#039;s upbeat mood, but this and the animation for Skip Beat don&#039;t particularly stick out. The same thing applies to the show&#039;s soundtrack as it does its part to complement scenes in the series that fit for their intended purpose, but have nothing too memorable with them.<br />
<br />
Gripes aside, Skip Beat is still one of the better shoujo titles I&#039;ve seen recently as there hasn&#039;t been anything from the demographic that has seriously hooked me beyond a number of titles that came out during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The focus on Kyoko&#039;s growth as an actress is a compelling and enjoyable story worth seeing throughout Skip Beat&#039;s 25-episode run, alongside other characters in stardom who interact with her. If you&#039;re a shoujo anime fan, this is worth a definite look.

    Love can make people do crazy things, even if it’s skipping high school to follow your boyfriend to Tokyo to begin his career as a rockstar. Admittedly, the popular rom-com Skip Beat may give bad presumptions when it’s revealed that the main character’s (Kyouko) sole motivation for entering showbiz is to seek revenge on her ex-boyfriend (Shou) by outshining him. In actuality, Skip Beat is just as fun to watch as its name portrays it to be. The plot itself is actually what brings out the comedy in the anime because of the characters’ reactions. The anime is not reflected on a girl’s life that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127523">
        revolves around her ex, but it focuses on how she discovers herself. Apart from the steady pacing, Skip Beat is also a prime example of how creators advertise a manga by ending the anime with a cliffhanger.<br />
<br />
The pacing is steady and engaging, and there are no fillers. The dramatic and funny moments are perfectly balanced. Nothing is immediate, including Kyouko’s attempt at stardom. A romance story develops in the anime, and the steady pacing is fulfilled by showing no intimacy within the series. The story also reflects on other characters instead of solely Kyouko, so the viewer gets to learn of situations from those characters’ points of view. <br />
<br />
The only problem with Skip Beat is that the story is incomplete. The romance is still in development and has a while until it fully blooms. Kyouko has a past with another main character that was shown in brief clips in later episodes, but it is never fully revealed. Kyouko is clueless about it, while the other character still keeps it a secret. Additionally, a new subplot was introduced near the very end of the series, and a solution is never reached. Although the story itself is incomplete, the creators did a good job on giving a hopeful ending. All of the characters were given a reflection, and it gives the viewer enough for the imagination. Since there has been no talk of a second season for the past four years, the viewer is left with no choice but to read the manga in the meantime. (7)<br />
<br />
Instead of a weak-hearted female lead that is usually present in shoujo anime, Kyouko is an aggressive and driven individual. All characters have their own personality, and it’s cool that some actually address the stupidity behind Kyouko’s motivation for showbiz. The main characters and supporting characters all balance out the theme of the anime. There are some characters with huge egos, contributing to the comedy as Kyouko enters the entertainment world by taking one step at a time. The contribution of the other characters also helps Kyouko develop into an independent and strong woman. The “Character” category would have a perfect score of 10, but the interruption of the subplot placed a halt on some of the characters’ development. (8)<br />
<br />
The animation is unique from most other anime. Apart from the plot itself, the animation is to thank for the comedy. Demonic and depressing auras, along with emotions, are drawn hilariously with ghostly figures. Also, the characters’ designs as chibi are both funny and adorable. The colors are exceptionally vivid and bright in the character and background designs, giving off a refreshing and fun atmosphere to the anime. (10)<br />
<br />
The voice actors were superb. Marina Inoue (voice of Kyouko) did an excellent job separating her innocent vs. aggressive voices to fit Kyouko’s split personality. “Dream Star” by generous is upbeat and expresses Kyouko’s confidence within herself. The OP and ED changed at Episode 20 as there is more love affection shown between characters. The background music is played at the right moments and fits the moods of each episode. (10)<br />
<br />
Skip Beat was very entertaining. I was desperately looking for a rom-com, and Skip Beat was often recommended. I turned it down several times in the past because of the synopsis. I was disappointed with no immediate romance, but the steady pacing caused the anime to exceed my expectations. The comedy and Kyouko’s determination are what mostly kept me watching. After the first episode, I became anxious to watch the next episodes to watch Kyouko achieve her goal. I disliked how some characters’ pasts were not emphasized and how a new subplot was introduced near the end. Now I’m reading the manga to complete the story. (8)<br />
<br />
Skip Beat is unique from other Shoujo anime, and it’s all thanks to a strong female lead. The drama and comedy are balanced, and the plot is irresistible as you’ll become drawn to the story and feel the need to watch it ‘til the end. It is meant to advertise the manga by leaving the viewer with a cliffhanger. As someone who read the manga after completing the series (starting at Chapter 67), I say that jumping on the Skip Beat bandwagon is definitely worth the ride. (8)

    What&#039;s fun when I watch a comedy show is the presence of a crazy character. In anime you&#039;ll surely find wacky characters such as Hiruma-sama (Eyeshield 21) and Kona-chan, but no one is wierder than Mogami Kyoko from this anime/manga skip beat. She was one of my most loved shoujo characters and as expected, the fun was multiplied when Skip Beat was adopted to an anime series.<br />
<br />
The plot is quite ordinary, &amp;quot;a tale of revenge&amp;quot;, but what separates it from the classics is the reason why and how it will be done. Kyoko decided to enter showbusiness to ruin the rising superstar Fuwa Shou, her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10555">
        childhood friend that betrayed her. The fact that she was once called by him as &#039;plain faced&#039; never affected Kyoko&#039;s determination. She willingly accepted few jobs and awkward situations just to gain her goal of being an idol and smash it all on Shou&#039;s face.<br />
<br />
The kind of love story featured in the series was some kind of indirect romance which thrills me better than the showy type that was full of confessions and emotions.<br />
<br />
So far, I think Skip Beat was one of the best Romantic Comedy Anime this season.

    Skip Beat is truly one of my favorites of all time ever since the manga starts its publication, yet the anime capture every detail in the manga. The heroine is not your usual girl who always cries when down and weak all the time, but instead she becomes stronger and stronger. <br />
<br />
The story starts off about a &amp;quot;Pandora Box&amp;quot;  that was given to each person, and no one knows what is sealed inside. One Day, when Mogami Kyoko finds out that she was only being used by Fuwa Sho, her &amp;quot;Pandora Box&amp;quot; opens and promised revenge against Fuwa Sho. Then the start of her

    I put this anime off for the longest time, but it isn&#039;t at all what I expected! After re-watching 5 years later, I still give this anime a 10/10! <br />
<br />
The art was really good but what I enjoyed most was the chibi-style drawings that emphasized the humour and the funny parts from the anime. <br />
<br />
I would&#039;ve liked to see her take revenge on Sho and rise to a higher position, so in other words I would&#039;ve wanted an OVA or another season so I could see how it ends. But that being said, we can tell that she would&#039;ve gotten there eventually.

    I was initially reluctant to start this anime, the synopsis sounded like it could go either way in terms of quality.<br />
<br />
Fortunately i quickly got into this anime from the first few episodes, to the point i quickly found myself losing track of how long i&#039;d been watching for.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s fair to say if your not taken in by the first 2 episodes, this probably isn&#039;t the show for you.<br />
<br />
Without the doubt the main strength of this show is the protagonist Kyoko, her character and her attitude instantly warms the viewer to her and you can&#039;t help but want to see how she advances through the idol

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13291">
        industry and how she develops her relationships with the support characters.<br />
<br />
This anime is largely character driven, the plot itself does little more but present scenerios for Kyoko to meet a wide variety of characters throughout the show. If i were to compare this show to anything, it heavily reminds me of Fruits Basket, both with the main character, and the shifts from comedy to drama to undertones of romance. <br />
<br />
I found myself finishing every episode with a smile on my face, it&#039;s fair to say i found this show genuinely heart warming, i&#039;m hoping to see a second season, because with only 2 episodes remaining there still seem to be alot of lose ends to be resolved.<br />
<br />
<br />

    thought the opening sequence and song aren&#039;t all that inspiring, this anime (based off one of my favorite shoujo mangas) is a pretty well done and enjoyable adaptation so far.<br />
<br />
The story and plot are strong funny, unique, definitely something worth building on, which the animation and voice actors managed to capture pretty well.<br />
<br />
Kyoko in all her crazy flaming glory, Yoshiki Nakamura wonderful brand a humor all working towards a shoujo story that  stands out in a genre swimming with weak weeping leading ladies, so if you want a girl series that&#039;s a bot different and always willing to make fun of itself, give Skip-Beat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8743">
        the anime (and the manga if you haven&#039;t already, RIGHT NOW) a shot.

    If you disregard animation and art, the gender of the main character (usually) and other minor differences; one major difference remains between shoujo/jousei and shounen animes that have romance and drama as the two main themes. This difference protrudes as one thing and that is character interaction, character interaction is a result of script/screenplay and to a certain extent storyboard. Character interaction is one of the key features in anime that needs to be executed well for it to be successful, if an anime has good character interaction then you can almost forgive everything else that&#039;s bad about that particular anime. This being said, there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13648">
        has never been nor will there ever be (probably) a shounen romantic drama/comedy with as good character interaction as a shoujo anime equivalent in themes.<br />
<br />
Now why I have decided to start this review by talking about character interaction is because Skip Beat has good character interaction and this saves it from being a bad anime. Now ransack your hearts; this anime had fairly weak storyboard, the events happen rather haphazardly and the character development of some characters are below mediocre. In truth though, it&#039;s hard to have good character development for many characters but then you really have to make the characters undergoing bad character development either forgettable or really, really good in entertainment value. Skip Beat did not deliver this hence why some characters feel unfinished or even unnecessary to the story.<br />
<br />
All the same this anime is very good, it was a good concept and I particularly enjoyed the fact that the main protagonist wasn&#039;t some meek, weak pushover that so many other female main protagonists have been. There was some spunk in this girl that I appreciated even though she could be a bit too clueless at times regarding some things for my liking.<br />
<br />
Now my overall rating of this anime is based on the things I have pointed out in this review, but also on the fact that I am expecting a season two as it was not only hinted at the end of the last episode but also due to the storyboard and the overall worthless conclusion to the anime, you know it, I know it; we have seen that ending before. So many times... so many times. Atleast it wasn&#039;t as bad as KareKano though.

    Shoujo Lovers! This is something you can&#039;t afford to miss out. As for the rest, you might think twice if you are going to overlook this anime, just because it&#039;s, you know what, &quot;Oh! Another shoujo anime. I will pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple of my female friends (blu-chan, hagumi_honey) have been pestering me to watch this anime. I was quite reluctant as the story seemed too iffy when i read the synopsis. And then, I recommended the anime to my sister, since she is a crazy shoujo anime fan, and decided to overlook the anime myself.<br />
<br />
I was just recently having the time of my life, with Hayate,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20322">
        Ippo and Spice and Wolf II all rolling week in week out, until they all ended. I was looking for a replacement but was not sure what to pick. Then I checked my HDD and thought &quot;okay. there is skip beat! there, I copied from my sister&#039;s.&quot; I thought lets see whats so good about it, as my sis has been ruining my life wanting me to see that.<br />
<br />
And here I am, fell in love with the anime. It actually amazed me to find out later on that the original manga started way back in 2002, and has been really popular ever since and still ongoing.<br />
<br />
Anyways, thats me and Skip Beat! Now for the review:<br />
<br />
Here is your synopsis. Kyoko (Marina Inoue), an energetic and devoted girl, gave up school and decided to follow her prince-charming Shoutarou &#039;Sho&#039; Fuwa (Mamoru Miyano) to Tokyo as Sho has set his dream to become the next big thing of Japan. Yeap. His aim is to become the number one Idol in Japan. But there is this big problem. The current heart-throb of Japanese Entertainment line, Ren Tsuruga (Katsuyuki Konishi). Sho goes out of control whenever there is anything about Ren, and throws his frustration and whatnot to Kyoko. Kyoko, as a result has been hating Ren for ruining her love-life. And she badmouths Ren all the time to show her support for Sho. Kyoko, giving her all to Sho, decided to follow Sho through and through, until she overheard that Sho thinks lowly of her and the only reason he keeps her around is for household chores. Kyoko&#039;s world shatters. She throws her hatred to Sho and promises him vengeance, that she will take him on in the very world he wants to rule over, the world of showbiz.    <br />
  <br />
Story: 10/10. One of the most lovable of shoujo stories out there I can tell you. Its right there in the ranks of the best. The story is simple but powerful, gives you the &quot;what will happen next&quot; and full of unpredictable outcomes that will keep you entangled and without knowing, you&#039;ll definitely get absorbed in no time.<br />
<br />
Throughout the entire anime, you&#039;ll find the determination and dedication runs through Kyoko and how she without even knowing herself, affects the people surrounding her, the obstacles she is about to overcome to reach her goal, and add to that, doing things which are irregular, if not insane.<br />
<br />
And of course, there is love to bloom. Kyoko, dejected through Sho, has closed her emotions of love and decides to never fall for anyone again. Ren, whom she has been badmouthing while with her days with Sho, she finds him also cold and lacking heart. But the reason behind Ren&#039;s coldness towards her, is something she doesn&#039;t know. But soon, she finds out that Ren is, deep down is not what she usually thought him to be. Will her heart finally skip a beat for the Japan&#039;s Number One? Find out yourself!<br />
<br />
Art: Okay, I will be honest here. Most of the shoujo anime sucks in drawing when it comes to surroundings. This one isn&#039;t an exception either. I hate to tell this, but every time I saw Ren&#039;s Porsche 911, I really wanted to redraw that. So yes. 5/10 for artwork of the surroundings.<br />
<br />
What covers up for the lack of details in the surroundings is of course the character drawings. There are lots of lots of chibi scenes, i would say every the other scene is probably drawn with chibi characters, but that goes so well with the mood and makes the anime even more lovable. But the best part about the drawing will remain the expressions when the mood is serious or needs attention. The eyes, eyebrows, the lips, the facial shadows everything is drawn so lively that you can actually not only feel the emotional state of the character but also the atmosphere around them. 10/10 for character drawings, which in whole gets an 8/10 overall.<br />
<br />
Sound: The BGM and the OP/ED are really superb. The sounds actually help to change the mood and the sounds change often as the animation hovers between serious expressions and chibi drawings. What makes it even more enjoyable is that the sounds are nicely blended with the screenplay. There was not once I felt that the BGM didn&#039;t go with the screenplay. As for the OP/ED, I fell in love with both the ED songs and I am sure anyone will too. The second OP is also very nice. Sound gets a 9/10 from me.<br />
<br />
Character: This is where the anime is probably reached its best. Kyoko, instead of falling apart, decides to take on Sho from the very instant her world is crushed. Her determination, dedication and ambition mixed with her softness and kindness, make her character one of the best female characters I have come across so far. Her self-declaration of not falling for anyone ever again, shows only her emotional state and although she believes her emotion of love is long dead, she does things for others which shows, deep inside, her heart is still capable skipping a beat or two. This is probably Marina&#039;s best performance as a seiyuu after Kasahara (Toshokan Sensou). <br />
<br />
Sho, performed by Mamoru Miyano, is already a legend in seiyuu world (Light Yagami (Death Note), Setsuna F. Seiei (Gundam 00), Tamaki Suou (Ouran Host Club), Death The Kid (Soul Eater) and many more). There&#039;s nothing much to say about his performance as his character amazingly swindles when he is in the public and when is in private. His shift of voice has always been a class above regular seiyuu and thus making him arguably the best in recent times. Sho is just another addition to his illustrious seiyuu career. He performed so well, you will definitely hate Sho.<br />
<br />
Ren Tsuruga, performed by Katsuyuki Konishi, (other major performances: Kamina (TTGL), Komui Lee (D.Gray-man), Haji (Blood+), Tooya (Ayashi no Ceres) Ozma Lee (Macross Frontier) etc.) has been amazing. Ren doesn&#039;t show his true emotion in front of everyone. His true personality remains a mystery to Kyoko as she can&#039;t compare the Ren who can be both cold and warm from time to time. Konishi performed the character as it should be, Ren, the number one Idol in Japan, who is professional to the last and always puts his works as priority one, shows the reason why he is the most successful man in the world of entertainment. As the anime progresses, Kyoko starts to understand Ren bit by bit, and without knowing herself, starts to admire him as her senpai.<br />
<br />
And the anime character list is rounded up with other interesting characters Kyoko is set to meet as she is about the find out that &#039;revenge over Sho&#039; is not the reason anymore as she takes every step to become an actress.  10/10 for characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: You bet I want moar! This anime is absolutely a masterpiece of entertainment. Seriously, I can&#039;t but have to say I will love to see they are making a 3 or 4 seasons of it. For now, I will be hoping that the anime gets a well deserved Season 2. And I will be getting the first release out online, because not having Skip Beat! in my watch list is almost hurting. 10/10 for enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall: I will rate it 9/10, as a whole. This anime has given me so much entertainment that I can rewatch this anime over and over again and will never, ever get tired of it, that I can assure.<br />
<br />
I am not sure whether my review will be enough to encourage more people into this anime, but I can guarantee one thing, you wont be able to drop this anime once you&#039;ve started it ;)   <br />

    This review comes from my own opinion. ^ ^<br />
<br />
Ok, so I&#039;ve recently finish watching this anime. I&#039;ve came across it quite a few times, but didn&#039;t really bother watching it because the description of this anime just didn&#039;t sound all that interesting. I watching it, and now I am regretting not watching it sooner. :)  <br />
<br />
Story: Well i gave it a 10 out of 10.<br />
The story truly is one of a kind, it quite surprised me. Well the basic story is about a girl named Kyoko who WAS always stepped on by the one guy she would give anything to( an up-coming star at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14830">
        that). Through certain chains of events (Yes i will not give spoilers cos i REALLY hate them) she realized she that she needs a change of personality, she will NOT be a pushover any longer. At this point in time she is determined to get her revenge. As she thought she realized....whats worse than to out-shine a star? And that&#039;s what this girl is striving for in this anime revenge.<br />
<br />
Art: Um, well, I am no expert, so therefore i am not really particular about the art it self. I (as an amature) think the anime art work is done well, plus the quality is pretty good therefore i gave a 10 out of 10. <br />
<br />
Sound:  Opening - Well the opening song was OK. Well, then again, I am PRETTY choosy when it comes to openings. Um, well PERSONALLY didn&#039;t like the intro music much(don&#039;t kill me for it), but it was still good cos the song lyrical wise did indeed match with the song :) .  Well like one thing i should include is that i think that everyone likes diffrent types of songs right? so i think everyone has their own opinion about it hehe~<br />
<br />
Apart from the opening throughout the anime it seems as they put good background music. They really do try to fit the mood, and it really does show.  Therefore i gave it a 8 out of 10 ^ ^<br />
<br />
Character: Well the characters are all very unique to one another. Well, the female lead (Huraayy) Kyoko is the beginning is very attached and thinks she cant picture her life without her beloved Shotaro. Shes been living with his family since she was young and became very attached to him, after all she DOES love him. Since he wanted to pursue his his dream career as a star and decides to take Kyoko along with him (but not for the reasons Kyoko THINKS). Anyway that&#039;s her in the beginning of the story, but she drastically begins to change for the better. She soon starts to relize she must do things for herself too, because she gave and gave to others (meaning Shotaro) but she never took the time to give to herself. Along her journey to a better self, she makes others relize them selfs aswell. Another main character in this story is Ren, a cold hearted star who never expereanced happiness till Kyoko can along. Many characters in this anime change for the better.<br />
<br />
Over all, i think all the characters were well thought out (Kyoko-giving caring passionate ect... Shotaro- Full of himself, cruel, antagonist,  Ken- cold, distant, means well.) Well i think that the writer put a lot of thought into designing the characters. I was very impressed on how well the clashed with one another. 10/10 :)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Well i got to say straight of the bat 10/10. Some parts were so filled with humor i just could not stop laughing. The thing is, its not just that that was enjoyable, the serious moments aswell, your just so into it that your expressionless. So a very good amusement in all aspects ^ ^<br />
<br />
<br />
i got to say, 9/10 over all.<br />
i recommend this to anyone that&#039;s interested in good animes ;)<br />
<br />
heheee hope this helped some of you~

    Wahahaha!!! Don&#039;t waste your time contemplating whether you&#039;re gonna watch this or not. I&#039;m telling you, go directly to your favorite streaming site or prepare your torrent downloader for this. This ANIME will shake your life.<br />
<br />
well, not really, ahem, kinda just carried away...<br />
<br />
I just made a recommendation of Skip Beat, it&#039;s with Ouran Host Club. My Ouran is my 2nd favorite anime,because i believe it greatly represents the SHOUJO GENRE. to tell the truth, i enjoy better shounen anime than shoujos, but OURAN changed my mind..as well with SKIP BEAT. Wahahahah!<br />
<br />
Who wouldn&#039;t love Kyoko, the main lead. I&#039;ll admit it. I can see some part

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12200">
        of me into her character. I still wish to be a princess, there&#039;s still the little child inside in me who still believes in fairy tales. Even though Kyoko is not speaking of it, her feminine side is so realistic and is so relevant to the youth today. <br />
<br />
A good lead is one my criteria in choosing anime. Just like Haruhi, I really really like free-spirited, intelligent, smart and strong-willed heroine. AND KYOKO FULLY EMBODIES IT. She&#039;s way better than my Haruhi-chan. OH mY GOSH!<br />
<br />
The REVENGE part is the best thing, because this help us to see the real Kyoko. I like her. She&#039;s not a show off. Yes, she might be a cry baby but is never an annoying one. She has a good disposition in life. She is not lady-like, which is the BEST about her personality. She is not boxed. WUSHU!<br />
<br />
And Ren, wufufufu! To think that Jerry Yan is gonna portray his character in the live action adaptation is such a...a....a.....a..........FEAST TO CELEBRATE...wUSHU~ I&#039;m thinking of RAIN. well, whatever. Ren Tsuruga is not your ordinary good boy bishounen. Good ThinG! I hate Gentle Lead Male who is SO GOOD TO BE TRUE! He has also his own evil ways, well, towards Kyoko. Which makes the 2 a more romantic couple...<br />
<br />
There goes SHO,,I also like his character even though he&#039;s supposed to be the antagonist. not only because my favorite dubber voiced him (MAMORU MIYANO) but he&#039;s also NOT AN ARCHETYPE. He&#039;s the coolest villain evAH!<br />
<br />
Well, if you like interesting characters like me, and just wanna have plenty of good and goofy times, try this right now. This will even surpass the Twilight Craze...BWAHAHAHAH!! Let&#039;s SKIP THE BEAT!<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
I also like Moko-san, Kyoko&#039;s partner...<br />
I hate Ariel Lin,,I don&#039;t want her to do Kyoko&#039;s role...can they change the casting please...<br />
Looking for more happy episodes...<br />
<br />
<br />
Love lots,<br />

    This series is the antithesis to Ai Yazawa&#039;s Nana! While Nana is a coming-of-age story about young adults pursuing their passions and having mature romantic relationships, Skip Beat is about Kyōko Mogami, a teenage girl who drops out of high school to get a full-time job, so she can simp for her childhood crush... and when he inevitably betrays her, her solution is... to stalk him and join the same talent agency, to get her revenge by becoming more famous than him! The premise is just as vapid as it sounds and while I occasionally like a nice romance anime to shut my mind off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378028">
        to, the narrative rolled along as sturdily as a flattened tire!<br />
<br />
⚠️ This review of Skip Beat! will be spoiler-free ⚠️<br />
<br />
—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
While I can perfectly understand why Kyōko would want revenge, it still boggles my mind why someone would drop out of school and get a job to support someone, if they hadn&#039;t even bothered to ask that person how they felt about them! It&#039;s harder to be sympathetic towards her plight, too, because she&#039;s pursuing a showbiz career as a tit for tat towards Shō! That storyline would hypothetically work if the comedy was good enough, but most of the humor consists of Kyōko being painfully awkward or is derived from quintessential romantic hijinks! <br />
<br />
If I were to compare the character motivations to the aforementioned &quot;Nana&quot; — Nana Osaki and Ren Honjō come together and fall apart at the behest of their individual needs, to chase after a rotten man would be the last of Nana&#039;s priorities! And while media doesn&#039;t exist on the precipice of teaching moral rights and wrongs, if a mangaka is going to make such an obnoxious premise, aimed towards teenage girls, there should be more humor and less romance! The story is written as though Kyōko is righteous for getting revenge, instead of doing what&#039;s right for herself. It&#039;s juvenile, the whole thing is!<br />
<br />
Like every shōjo series in existence, Kyōko makes friends and enemies in the entertainment industry, even &quot;frenemies&quot; (ahem, &quot;Kanae Kotonami&quot;)! Her self-sufficient and bold approach to acting makes her a fresh commodity to the management team. Though I did like how the series lined up the challenges, in a way that made you wonder &quot;how will she get herself out of this one?&quot; — it was difficult to root for her. Midway through the series, her rivalry with Shō dissolves into the two of them bickering like an old married couple, so it didn&#039;t feel like there were many stakes left.<br />

Luna&#039;s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅<br />
<br />
Kiyoko Sayama (director), notable works:<br />
* Amanchu! Advance<br />
* Brave 10<br />
* Saber Marionette J Again — Assistant Director<br />
* Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Prétear<br />
* Starry☆Sky<br />
* Tenshi Kinryōku (&quot;Angel&#039;s Sanctuary&quot;) ✅<br />
* Vampire Knight<br />
* Vampire Knight: Guilty<br />
<br />
Commentary: From what I&#039;ve seen of Ms. Sayama&#039;s directing, I&#039;m not the biggest fan. From what I remember of &quot;Prétear&quot; — the directing got a bit sloppy and stilted at times. The &quot;Tenshi Kinryōku&quot; adaptation is the best thing that I&#039;ve seen of hers, because truth be told, I have only watched the first season of &quot;Amanchu&quot; and the ※original director handed the series off to her. And &quot;Tenshi Kinryōku&quot; isn&#039;t exactly what you would call GOOD, but it&#039;s enjoyable enough for fans of the manga. The Skip Beat anime looks generic and none of the scenes are framed in a compelling way, the visual renderings use the bare minimum amount of animated &quot;key strokes&quot; and many of the motions are just from the mouth flaps!<br />

Commentary: Though I can&#039;t say that I was a big fan of the character Kyōko Mogami, Ms.  Inōe made her character the star of the show! Her delivery is the most energetic and fun, even among her more seasoned peers. I would compare her enigmatic performance to her roles as Chiri Kitsu (&quot;Sayonara Zetsubō Sensei&quot;) and Nao Midorikawa (&quot;Smile PreCure&quot;). Amazing work, as always!<br />

Commentary: Mr. Konishi performance as Ren Tsuruga portrayed him as a very attractive and compassionate character, despite his initial coldness. Though I am a fan of Mr. Konishi&#039;s role was the weakest, but the might have been more on the part of the script, rather than the actual actor. I would compare his character in Skip Beat to his roles as Tōya (&quot;Ayashi no Ceres&quot;) and Haji (&quot;Blood+&quot;). I personally prefer Mr. Konishi&#039;s calm, blue oni archetype, so I quite enjoyed hearing his voice in this one! Great job!<br />

Commentary: Mr. Miyano is so talented that he can make an insufferable, rich boy narcissist like Shōtarō Fuwa become someone that is easy to sympathize with. It may also be due to the crux of the terrible shōjo manga clichés, but as the series went on, I felt disgusted because I started to like him. I would compare the role to his parts as Taichi Mashima (&quot;Chihayafuru&quot;) and Shū☆Zō (&quot;Show By Rock!!&quot;). Incredible work!<br />
<br />
Conclusively, I can see why this series may appeal to some, but it wasn&#039;t my thing. Just as I had qualms with the banality of &quot;Kaichō wa Maid-sama!&quot; — though, I think this had more to do with my preference for josei series, rather than run-of-the-mill romances, my all-time favorite &quot;Shōjo Beat!&quot; publications WERE &quot;Nana&quot; and &quot;Honey &amp; Clover&quot;, after all. BOTH series revolve around YOUNG ADULT characters! Whereas, Kyōko is a teenager that&#039;s in the working world, because she voluntarily dropped out of high school. Based off of the lack of fun and indifference to (or dislike for) most of the characters in the narrative, I rate &quot;Skip Beat&quot; a 2/10.<br />
<br />

    This is a fun show.<br />
<br />
The main character, Mogami Kyouko, is one of the best shoujo heroines to pop up in a long time. I adored her dual personality--she swings between being an innocent, sweet, caring girl to a vindictive, bitter one at the drop of a hat! Her facial expressions are a riot, too, especially her chibi ones.<br />
<br />
Unlike so many heroines of this genre, Kyouko&#039;s motivation for seeking greatness in showbiz is revenge, not love. Of course, revenge is never a good motivation, and a fair portion of Kyouko&#039;s character development involves her learning to love and trust people again, or at least to learn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26605">
        to enjoy acting for its own sake.<br />
<br />
The rest of the main characters are equally enjoyable. Japanese voice actor Miyano Mamoru (Light from Death Note, Tamaki from Ouran HSHC) is absolutely perfect as as Shoutaro--the character&#039;s arrogance, massive ego, and adolescent attitudes are fully on display whenever he speaks. Kyouko&#039;s eventual love interest, Tsuruga Ren, voiced by the always-fantastic Konishi Katsuyuki (Kamina from Gurren Lagann, Soubi from Loveless, Hisagi from Bleach), is frankly one of the hottest bishounen to appear on screen in recent memory. He&#039;s a fully developed character too, with his own flaws and foibles. Interestingly enough, the viewer sees a good quantity of the action from his point of view, which makes him a refreshing change from the mysterious, aloof bishie that one often sees in shoujo anime. Kyouko&#039;s friend, &quot;Mouko&quot; and Ren&#039;s manager, Yashiro, are fine additions to the anime&#039;s cast as well.<br />
<br />
That is not to say this anime is without flaws. The animation is rather poor, and the frame rate is embarrassingly low. Of course, there really isn&#039;t enough action in this show to really merit a high animation budget, but at least they could have used fewer still-frame shots and included a little more detail in the sparse character designs. It also seems like that the animators, every time they could, replaced the backgrounds with pink shoujo sparkles and reduced the characters to chibi forms just to save drawing effort.<br />
<br />
The anime suffers from major pacing problems as well. The show progresses at a crawl, lingering much too long on unimportant events (like the mini-arc involving the little bratty girl) instead of progressing the plot or Kyouko&#039;s relationship with Ren. The ending (don&#039;t worry, no spoilers here) leaves something to be desired, too, as it cuts out in the middle of one of the manga arcs. It makes me wish they&#039;d hurried up more in the beginning so they could have at least finished the storyline (perhaps they were hoping for a second season...?).<br />
<br />
Anyway, overall this anime is worth watching. The characters, plot, and over-the-top humor simply make up for whatever compositional flaws there are.<br />
<br />
And for those of you who&#039;ve finished the anime and are looking for more, definitely pick up the manga. It eats the anime for lunch.

    Ah...Skip Beat...what can I say about you, except that you&#039;re probably THE most enjoyable anime I&#039;ve ever watched. If you&#039;ve ever jumped into an anime, not expecting much of anything from it, so ready to drop it (I was NOT a big fan of the art at first) and yet after watching a few minutes of the first episode you knew you couldn&#039;t for any reason pull away? Well that&#039;s how I felt watching Skip Beat! I saw this a while back, but I&#039;ve currently started reading the manga, so I thought I&#039;d give it a review.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is one of revenge. Kyouko is devoted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30059">
        to her childhood friend Shou and thus tries to help him out on his quest to become famous. But Shou is a jerk of epic proportions and he mistreats Kyouko to the point she can&#039;t take it anymore. She decides she&#039;ll get revenge on him for all he&#039;s done and how he&#039;s made her &#039;lose her youth.&#039; She decides entering show biz and becoming an even bigger star than him is the way to go. Along the way she learns a couple of important lessons, growing and changing as she tries to make it to the top. It&#039;s really not the most outlandish story line out there but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the most common either. Even if the story line wasn&#039;t solid, it&#039;s the trials and tribulations of Kyouko and her UBER awesome personality that makes this anime solid.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I was a bit turned off by the art to the point I almost didn&#039;t watch it, but I decided to at least give the first episode a look-see and I was hooked. I&#039;ve learned to feel comfortable with the art and I&#039;ve come to feel it fits the characters just right.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I don&#039;t pay much attention, so either way, good or bad, I wouldn&#039;t know XD<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Kyouko is the solid lead of this anime and by all means it stands on her shoulders alone. She&#039;s not your typical weak, crybaby, shojo anime heroine. She&#039;s strong, independent, hard-working and strong-willed. Plus, she has a wicked vengeful, &#039;I&#039;ll kick your ---- any day!&#039; kind of attitude. But at the same time she&#039;s pure-hearted and deep down she&#039;s really just someone who wants to be loved and accepted, whether she understands that herself or not. Plus, she&#039;s hilarious. The first episode alone has her whipping out like 100000 facial expressions that are just drop dead funny. That&#039;s another thing that makes her great, she&#039;s sooooo expressive. You&#039;re never at odds about what she&#039;s thinking. YOU JUST KNOW. The other characters are great as well, each having a personality that, although seems very shallow, is in fact quite multi-faceted. But one thing is always evident, it seems Kyouko is always the one bringing out the best in everyone. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I don&#039;t usually laugh out loud at anime... to be perfectly honest, even if it&#039;s actually funny, I&#039;ll laugh on the inside. BUT I couldn&#039;t do that with Skip Beat. It was non-stop LOL-ness, to the point people were staring and thinking I was weird. I can truly say, if you&#039;re into this sort of anime, you&#039;ll be laughing your tail off too. It&#039;s just a fun anime. And you can&#039;t help but relate to Kyouko and feel everything she&#039;s feeling. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I&#039;d say, for shojo anime lovers out there, this is the best I&#039;ve seen. And I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll enjoy it, even if not as much as I did.

    Skip Beat is definitely one of my favorite anime shows. I honestly don&#039;t normally like most shoujo anime, but Skip Beat is different. This show is on my top 5 because it has a fantastic storyline, fantastic characters, and nonstop excitement. On top of that, it has romance as well...with a twist. Kyoko practically loses her ability to love after being betrayed by the only guy she ever loved. She had basically devoted her life to him so, on that fateful day when she is betrayed, it sets her loose. Kyoko stops being a sweet, innocent girl and goes into show business as Fuwa Shotaro

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14831">
        (the guy she liked) already is a popular singer. She stops at nothing to try to outshine Sho. He was cruel and now, he needs to pay in her eyes.  What will it take? Will Kyoko be able to rise to the top? Can she really win when she only desires revenge? Watch the anime, read the manga, Skip Beat is fantastic!<br />
<br />
<br />
The story~<br />
The story is excellent and very unique.  Kyoko basically becomes a popular actress because she wants to get revenge on Sho.  It starts off like this, but then she changes.  Acting becomes her passion, and it&#039;s not all about revenge anymore (although she still hates Sho haha).  She builds a new life for herself in a way, with new relationships and more.<br />
Art~<br />
For art, I must say this is the lowest point of the anime/manga.  The men all have weird, pointy chins although the girls look decent.  Honestly though, besides the chins, everything is pretty ok xP.<br />
Sound~<br />
8<br />
There is lovely music and it always fits the different scenes.  Don&#039;t have much to say, but the op/ed was better than average.<br />
Characters~<br />
Wow, the characters are something else.  Kyoko, Sho, Ren and everyone else become so developed throughout the show.  Hopefully, the anime will continue because they grow even more in the manga.  The characters are original and thoroughly enjoyable.  Even the villains end up fascinating you and aren&#039;t extremely cliche and boring.<br />
Enjoyment~<br />
Overall, I absolutely ADORE this anime.  I recommend this show to anybody who is looking something different from the typical, boring shoujo.  Skip Beat is on my top 5 for a reason! ;O

    Synopsis: <br />
This show &quot;follows the story of Kyouko who loves her childhood friend Sho, but is betrayed by him.&quot; Kyouko then wants to get revenge on him by being more than him. <br />
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Beat<br />
<br />
Plot/Story: (Minor Spoiler Warning) [10/10] <br />
[How did it begin] <br />
Kyouko did everything for Sho out of love. But that love didn&#039;t last when she secretly entered the Sho&#039;s building. After learning the truth of his feelings, she vowed revenge on him.<br />
<br />
[How did the plot progress] <br />
Kyouko plotted to ruin him by becoming more than him in the show business he was in. Kyouko went straight to EMI, the largest show business, to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338989">
        start her career by using unnatural ways. <br />
<br />
[What are the arcs?]<br />
Introduction arc, Princess Coup d&#039;Etat arc, The Miraculous Language of Angels arc, Bo&#039;s arc, Curara CM arc, Manager arc, Prisoner arc, Dark Moon arc.<br />
<br />
Characters/Character Development: [10/10]<br />
Throughout the story, all the characters had a place and all of them developed. Their personality and their actions made sense. <br />
<br />
The character development for the show is really great. The main character changed from being immature to mature with finding her sense of self.  <br />
<br />
Art/Animation: [8/10]<br />
Art is old, but not bad. The character expressions that are anime like were that far back then I thought (I mean the chibi expressions). After watching these kinds of old anime, I got used to them. The round chin is really sticking out on Ren though. The animation is smooth and flowed well. <br />
<br />
Music: [8/10]<br />
The opening and the ending themes were catchy that I watched it more than usual. The OST soundtrack didn&#039;t have an awkward placing and I didn&#039;t notice it much. I liked it.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict:<br />
Score: 9/10<br />

    The anime is amazing. The characters are learning some lesson throughout the story like learning to love or to move on if something doesn&#039;t go your way. The advice they put through the story somehow fits with reality. I don&#039;t really find the ending of the show that great but the rest of the story is extremely amazing and fits with the plot. I can&#039;t say i loved it but i did enjoy it and liked it, and i recommend you watch it.
