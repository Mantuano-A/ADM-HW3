    It is true that school-life is one of the most common genres in Japanese animation. From specialty school (magic, cooking etc) to school-life with mysteries or supernatural. In short, it is a genre that has been widely exploited in all respects. As for Tsuki ga Kirei, it doesn&#039;t pretend to revolutionize the genre and doesn&#039;t propose an original plot at first.<br />
<br />
In fact Tsuki ga Kirei is exceptional in its simplicity. The relationships between the different characters are particularly well developed. The series accurately combines the gestures, facial expressions of the characters without exaggerating the reactions, which in some scenes may seem surprising and unexpected. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251451">
        series doesn&#039;t necessarily focus on the dialogues and emphasizes the subtlety of the reactions of the characters making the relationships very realistic.<br />
The other point is the meeting of our two protagonists: Akane and Kotarou. Initially they don&#039;t know each other. They notice briefly in the classroom and do not talk to each other. Their relationship is built slowly but surely. At first, they look at each other several times discreetly, meaning that they are interested in each other. Then, following certain trivial events, they meet several times. Of course, you may be a little irritated by their behavior because they are shy and because they do not dare look at each other to discuss. But gradually they learn to know each other.Also social networks play an important role in their relationship and in general we notice the omnipresence of LINE (very popular in Japan) among students.<br />
<br />
This relationship will gradually evolve into a romantic relation. And with this type of relationship come all the difficulties that go hand in hand, namely the acceptance of the relationship by the entourage and the friends. Jealousy? Envy? Different feelings that lead some characters to interfere in the Akane-Kotarou couple and possibly create love triangles. Do not expect ridiculous infidelities that would be completely out of step with the personality of our protagonists. Of course there will be difficult times calling into doubt the feelings of another or his, wondering how their relationship is solid. And thank God! the series does not propose forced drama with characters who cry to each episode in order to move its audience.<br />
<br />
Furthermore our characters live with their families. Surprisingly and relatively rare in a school-life, we see the parents of our two protagonists. This aspect contributes to the realism of the series allowing us to see the relationship of our protagonists with their family. Especially that of Kotarou with his mother who regularly opposes his son because the latter privileges his dream of becoming a writer to his studies. Akane&#039;s and her sister&#039;s relationship is also very interesting, as she often gives advice on Akane&#039;s love life. Besides our two protagonists also have their occupations: Akane participates in the athletic club and Kotarou at the festival of the city. The series devotes time to show their perseverance and motivation to achieve their goals. To return to what I was saying on LINE, I was surprised by the modernity of this series. Especially when a publisher recommends Kotarou to write light novels ((Kotarou doesn&#039;t seem to know it) or the big sister who laughs when she sees Akane knitting a scarf for Kota. (She also mentions that they are in 2017)<br />
<br />
Concerning the secondary characters, Chinatsu and Hira receive a screen time sufficient for their characterization and develop their interests and objectives. For the other characters I wouldn&#039;t say they are useless because regularly, in several scenes, some play a prominent role in the Akane-Kotarou relationship. I regret that the series doesn&#039;t spend more time for these characters. Although at the end of each episode we see small short films showing funny moments among the various couples formed of these supporting characters. Contrary to our two main protagonists, they have already developed relations. I thank the writer because he has not censored allusions about the nights that the couples spent together.<br />
<br />
On the technical aspects, the artistic direction has the merit of being unique with simple chara-design without weird hair colorings (except Roman lol). The soundtrack plays an important role in creating a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. But many scenes have no background music, preferring to highlight the sound effects. No use of artifices to reinforce dramatic moments, just discrete tracks. I don&#039;t forget the remarkable performances of Nao Touyama in the scenes where the characters don&#039;t speak allowing the viewer to rest while contemplating the cityscapes or the daily life of the characters. However I have spotted is the use of the CGI on the characters in the background which is frankly unpleasant and which I hope will be corrected in the blu-ray. (I sometimes feel they limp)<br />
<br />
I personally had a great time watching this series. I agree that the series doesn&#039;t have a deep or complex plot that allows it to stand out from other works but nevertheless I have no really honest criticism to make it except one or two above-mentioned. The guiding principle of the series has always been respected and has mantain a certain coherence from beginning to end. If you are looking for a school-life with genuine relationships, I can only recommend that you throw yourself on it. On the contrary, if you prefer school-life with redundant gags and more eccentric characters, the series is not for you. However, I think Tsuki ga Kirei is a unique experience that should be watched by anyone looking for novelty.

    Tsuki ga Kirei is a boring adolescent romance that masquerades as something more than it is. It&#039;s avoidance of standard romance tropes is not an act that by default renders a romance any better, or even realistic or compelling, if it&#039;s still utterly lacking in anything substantive whatsoever. <br />
<br />
The main couple have a serious lack of chemistry that plagues the show from front to back. Their reservations and quaint interactions are cutely refreshing and much more in line with the actuality of young love than your typical anime portrayal. That said, I still don&#039;t understand why they liked each other in the first place or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252237">
        why that feeling only grew over time. They were awkward, but it wasn&#039;t just a cute display of awkwardness, as they legitimately had nothing substantive to talk about, ever. It felt almost ironically shallow. Nothing particularly exciting happened either, which is both astounding and damning in this show&#039;s bewilderingly positive reception. I personally don&#039;t watch television or film to be bored out of my mind while in some desperate search for trope-avoidance tactics. There are surely more valuable things to do in this world than conduct pointless meta-analysis on how a boring anime is actually good because it isn&#039;t generic. Uniqueness and quality are not mutually exclusive metrics.<br />
<br />
Tsuki&#039;s side characters are also extremely undeveloped and not impactful in the slightest. The show employed an interesting technique of having brief side character stories shown after the ED of each episode, but these were far too scattered and simplistic to provide any insight into the actual characters. &#039;Twas nothing more than some quick laughs arising out of character interactions from characters&#039; faces you sadly may not even recognize or ever see again. Back to the main show, the two romantic foils, who had actual relevant screen-time, disappointingly ended up amounting to nothing more than stale obstacles. There was also no discernible difference between the two&#039;s roles in the series. Furthermore, there really wasn&#039;t a discernible difference between the two main characters themselves other than gender. The pseudo-plot is that these are two very goal oriented longing to fulfill their dreams but gratefully burdened by unexpected love. The actual plot is that these are two regular kids who aren&#039;t particularly interesting to watch nor display no distinct, marked instances of actual romantic relationship.<br />
<br />
The art style is a blatant ripoff of Kimi no na Wa. Which is good, in the sense that Kimi no na Wa has a great art style, but somewhat shameless nonetheless. The fonts, the lighting techniques, the environments,.. everything screamed budget Shinkai. I sure hope he gets royalties from this show for inadvertently providing the entire visual framework. There was also a very prevalent usage of CGI for background characters in Tsuki ga Kirei, which was wholly unnecessary and distracting. The CGI was awful and not befitting of modern animation standards. There was also no real need to have crowds of background characters populating every scene. The environments were perfectly fine on their own. The music was decent but nothing notable and the voice acting was very poor. I haven&#039;t heard so many audible groans, breaths, and bodily noises since I last watched Dragon Ball Z. Why write actual script when you can pencil in dumb, nonsensical noises?<br />
<br />
Watch Kimi ni Todoke or Ao Haru Ride if you want to see shy young people fall in love organically, albeit dramatically and with a theatrical flavor, as is the nature of entertainment media. Those shows are compelling, in part, because high school is an interesting romantic setting. Middle school is not. Please do remind me of a middle school romance you witnessed that wasn&#039;t (in retrospect) hilariously shallow and forced. Tsuki ga Kirei is the most forced romance I&#039;ve ever watched, personally, and that&#039;s not enjoyable.

    Honestly in my opinion, this show is one of those original work gems that stand out for this season of Spring 2017!<br />
<br />
An Original Work containing Romance, mixed along with Middle School themed characters, plus those awkward and moments we all had at some point in our lives. As what some others have said, I also agree that this show is something refreshing and nice to watch. <br />
<br />
The story has good development overtime. It&#039;s not really rushed a lot with tons of scenes and action that was all done in one go. The story progressed at a reasonable good pace. Though, there&#039;s a notable amount of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251428">
        time-lapsing to transition to each episode. I did like the development for the characters too, since it went at a pace that isn&#039;t too fast for viewers to try and understand, and not too slow where the viewers will be bored.<br />
<br />
The art is good quality. There were a few scenes that were done well. However, I do have some issues with a few particular scenes that could be revised for the DVD/BD Release. But other than that, I don&#039;t think it would affect much for my rating. Art wise for the characters, I liked it, and found Akane cute too. <br />
<br />
The sounds is something that I found pleasant. The casts all fit with the characters represented too. What stood out for me was the noises that Akane makes. &quot;Eh?&quot; &quot;Aah!&quot; Un!&quot; Like Kumiko noises. Kotarou on the other hand, &quot;Ah..&quot; &quot;ooh..&quot; &quot;Un.&quot; basically like Akane but a male version. (lol) Though, that did motivate me to work on a video dedicated to both of their noises that I could find from every episode. <br />
<br />
The characters, I don&#039;t have much to say (As it also contains spoilers if I do say something about them and the others) but characters that will make you want to like, laugh at, or maybe be going, &quot;What? No! Don&#039;t you dare do that!&quot; It&#039;s a typical range of emotions and stereotypes that you find in Middle/High School. I do find that the staff and producers managed to make the characters feel more interesting instead of bland.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment with the show was lovely. I did like it how in the ED, there&#039;s text conversations that is interesting to read. I do believe someone made a forum post dedicated to translations for the conversations. Anyways, the Shorts after the ending were entertaining too. Some in which are hilarious. When I get my Blu-Ray order in October, I will definitely re watch the show to see if they changed anything from how it was aired this season.<br />
<br />
Overall, I loved Tsuki Ga Kirei. As I stated, it&#039;s one of those original work gems that is both good and refreshing to watch. I&#039;ve started to support this show by ordering the Blu-Ray. You should too if you enjoyed it! My last thoughts is that it would be lovely to see an OVA or an adaptation (like light novel, manga) for Tsuki Ga Kirei. Who knows what Studio Feel. and the staff members might do for now. Hopefully, maybe something that is good as Tsuki Ga Kirei :)

    Most romantic tales are quite ubiquitous. There is a chance meeting, an initial spark, then further interactions, perhaps some conflict and ultimately a resolution. There also tends to be a sense of grandiosity in these stories, where for example a world war causes the lovers to be separated, or perhaps one of the pair is struck by an incurable disease. Tsuki ga Kirei, at first glance, is not too different in these respects. However, while the outline of this anime is similar, there is a certain finesse and subtlety which I will now get into in more detail.<br />
<br />
Before delving too deep, however, there&#039;s a key

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252101">
        symbolic concept that&#039;s used in this series and it involves the use of the moon. There is a saying in Japan that goes as such: “The moon teaches us that darkness can’t hide the beauty of life if we know how to reflect beauty”. It is by this proverb whereby the Tsuki ga Kirei&#039;s title is based off, as well as how the characters grow throughout this show and ultimately how the romance is developed. An example which illustrates this is during the ending sequence in each episode where a moon appears on the top right-hand corner of the screen. Starting from a new moon and concluding with a full moon, this imagery hints that in the end the romance between Akane and Kotarou will have been fully realised and will come into fruition. This is further shown, as a full moon is often seen as a symbolism for height of power, the peak of clarity, fullness and obtainment of desire: which in this case is romantic tension. <br />
<br />
In addition to this allegory, quotes from a famous Japanese author, named Osamu Dazai, are tastefully used in each episode. These quotes are directed from Kotarou’s point of view and are applicable to the advancement of the story. In episode 1 the quote “The feeling of joy is perhaps like a speck of gold, glimmering faintly at the bottom of a river of grief” is used, while in a later episode the recitation “This is what I want to believe implicitly: Man was born for love and revolution”. These aren’t utilised without any ulterior purpose simply to sound witty, but are imperative to give the viewer the ability to follow the state of the story, as well as to read the character’s mind-sets at that point in time: starting from the initial moment when affection is first sparked, until the eventual full-fledged liaison.<br />
<br />
As stated in the introduction, refining of simple techniques are used in Tsuki ga Kirei. These techniques are made use of because in essence, this is a simple story: two middle-schoolers meet by sheer chance and a romance blooms. The advantage of such a straight-forward setting is that the more vital features of a good story are highlighted, while simultaneously a large audience is able to enjoy said story, since there is not a lot of challenging information which needs to be digested first-hand. There are no deeply psychological traits here, nor are there any surreal plot-twists. In all honesty, that is precisely what made this anime so effective to me. All the viewer’s focus is predominantly extended to the relationship between the characters, without much distraction from anything else. Tsuki ga Kirei, in this way, is a profoundly efficient tale as every scene exists simply to further and more strongly achieve a realistic narrative.<br />
<br />
Correspondingly, the efficient nature of the story is accentuated by the barren use of any major drama or comedy segments (in the main story at least). While these attributes are certainly existent, similarly to the quotations of Dazai, they are applied elegantly and are spread enough apart from one another, so that no overwrought or soppy scenes would strive the viewer away from the show&#039;s principal backbone; which once again is the successful capturing of a realistic and believable cast of characters set in a logical and credible environment.<br />
<br />
The only issue I personally experienced with Tsuki ga Kirei’s story, ironically (as this is the event that sold most people into becoming infatuated with the show), is with the ending itself. Although beautifully executed, I feel as if it ventured away from what the production attempted to achieve and that is centrally a credible chain of events, but I digress as I was relatively pleased with the finale.<br />
<br />
Matching the astounding storytelling, what makes the characters so rational is that they all have their own respective backgrounds, quirks and set of values. This makes each persona their own, instead of relying on tired tropes which bargain on a gimmick to describe their personalities. Equally, one of the most notable achievements in Tsuki ga Kirei is the manner in which the characters enhance each other throughout the series, but more on this later on. Foremost I want to talk about the two protagonists:  Azumi Kotarou and Mizuno Akane, starting with Azumi Kotarou.<br />
<br />
The story is told chiefly from the perspective of Kotarou as he gradually develops a meaningful connection with Akane, while exploring the changes that occurs in his adolescent mind. What makes him such a proper protagonist is that he acts, sounds and thinks like a child in his age. Combining a fascination for classical writing and love for shadow-boxing, he feels like a living, breathing person and in the same fashion as the story he is shown in a diffident, simplistic light, once again rejecting any unnecessary personality traits which would likely distract from his maturation as a teenager. He is an individual filled with a past of embarrassments and regrets; he has felt failure many a time yet he is determined to succeed in the end. The outstanding writing and characterisation allows for Kotarou to feel genuinely authentic as he is not shown to be without flaws, yet simultaneously he has enough motivation in himself so that he is an ever-changing and distinctive person, without the limits seen in typical male protagonists.<br />
<br />
Akane is the female leading character and, besides acting precisely how a middle-school girl would, has her own key traits which allows for her to have an ineluctable bond with Kotarou. She too has experienced sorrows such as constantly moving homes and failures such as losing sprinting races despite years of preparation that permits her to have this innate and almost platonic initial connection to Kotarou, as they both share similar experiences and so can converse about their problems together. However, unlike the way in which Kotarou is portrayed, Akane has experienced and tasted success; she achieves high grades in school and readily surpasses her previous record times in track and field. She also often plays with this potato plush toy, which underscores her anxious nature, increasing the amount of realism in her personality. This opposing nature in character, leads to our main male lead to almost yearn for and strive to be like Akane; this leaves the story space to work with and manipulate its run-time and thus leading to maximum evolution in their romantic relationship, which suggests why Tsuki ga Kirei is so efficacious as a romance.<br />
<br />
As previously stated, a remarkable achievement of Tsuki ga Kirei is how different characters enhance each other during the run-time of the show. This enhancement is achieved by the surprising use of both sets of parents of the main characters. For both parties, parents provide much-needed support, be it in a direct way such as motivational talks, or in a laconic and unhurried way such as the making of a celebratory lunch box. Parents are underused in media in my opinion, as more often than not only one parent exists as the focal role for development. This is a waste of good influence, however, as parents are constantly around the characters we follow in stories, so the presence of both a mother and a father is more likely to lead to strengthening of the more relevant characters.<br />
<br />
Although the side-characters do not have as much exposure as Kotarou and Akane, they do a great job of adding gravity and intensity to the relationship between them. They are all well crafted and balanced and often have their own battles and desires, which creates increased tension in the overall atmosphere of the series. Something, however, that I would have liked to have been done better is the reasoning behind the actions that some characters take later on the story. I can’t help but feel as if these were slightly rushed so that the intrinsic romance is focused on instead. In a way this is forgivable, as teenagers often act irrationally and radically, particularly in situations such as love which they may not have as much experience in.<br />
<br />
The art, although once again simple, contributes greatly to the relaxed atmosphere of the anime. Backgrounds are meticulous compared to that of the foreground and the designs of the characters. This, together with the use of blank space and white accenting is perhaps to further emphasise how simple humans, especially in their younger ages, truly are as well as the nostalgic feeling of first falling in love. The facial expressions characters make, although lacking detail, are accurate to the emotions felt at that point in time. <br />
<br />
The animation, however, is more polarising. Despite the fact that many frames are drawn to highlight an accurate representation of a character’s actions, the flow of these frames is commonly ruined by sloppy editing, leading to an almost jerky aesthetic. Furthermore, the use of CGI in the background for crowds of people makes casual movement robotic to say the least. These CGI models don’t carry themselves as fluidly as the drawings do and often end up looking comedic. In retrospect, however, Tsuki ga Kirei’s production team was struggling to release episodes on time, so this is less of an issue concerning talent and more of an issue on time management. <br />
<br />
One of Tsuki ga Kirei&#039;s most surmounting achievements for me, were the extra phonetics the voice actors made during a lot of the dialogue segments. This produces an almost lifelike status when hearing characters converse, as their conversations mimicked that of an actual discussion. Not only this, but especially in the opening episodes the awkward disposition between Kotarou and Akane’s relationship was further realised by this effortless technique. Besides this, the voice-acting itself was as well pleasant to listen to, especially knowing how both protagonists’ actors were relative newcomers to the industry, accommodating for a more genuine-sounding series as the viewer relates that unfamiliar voice to the specific character being voiced.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack itself was comprised of some wonderful vocal insert songs and a pleasant array of classical instruments. These were used sparingly and so no particular soundtrack ever felt forced or hackneyed, which is quite rare for a show especially when you have marathon-ed it, like I did. Perhaps a hindrance I felt with the show’s musical score, is that no singular song especially stood out to me. This may, of course, simply be a result of the abundance of different soundtracks used.<br />
<br />
From its hyper-realistic setting with stunningly crafted backgrounds, to its effortless communication of emotion at just the right times, Tsuki ga Kirei is an anime which promptly came to my surprise from the very first minute of the first episode. Euphoric yet wistful, joyful yet dismal, melancholy yet hopeful, the innate beauty which Tsuki ga Kirei permeates can dispense a wide array of emotions. For myself, this allure lead to tears being shed through almost every episode despite there being no logical reason to. But in shows like these, reason should be the last thought in your mind: <br />
<br />
just sit back and cherish the inevitable void you will feel once the 12th episode hits 24:26. <br />

Final comment:  An absolute marvel of a school romance; there may never be another like it of its caliber for me.

    Every season we can watch average animes, good animes but few times we have the privilege of watching an amazing anime that will be part of us for a long time. Tsuki ga Kirei will fulfill our expectations and more.<br />
<br />
Even if the story could be at the beginning simple, it will start advancing in a way that will keep us entertained until the end. The story has excellent pacing and covers the insecurity, the desires, the doubts, the dreams of a group of teenagers. <br />
<br />
We follow the story of a couple from the start until the end (in some way), their names are Akane and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251444">
        Kotaru. They are just typical teenagers, and their relation starts from the immaturity and the usual shyness, the fear and the anxiety that can be found in the real world every day. As the relationship progress, we can visualize how the casual insecurity, the distance, and the everyday life issues appear and how they try to surpass them.  From my perspective, that is one of the reasons to watch this anime because in some way we will feel related to that kind of relationship.    <br />
<br />
The anime has a great narrative combined with great visual art, and perfect sound timing creates a masterpiece that you will enjoy. The characters are well developed, they transmit their feelings, emotions to the audience and not only the main ones, but the extra characters also add some atmosphere to the story. <br />
<br />
The music and the songs are great. They used it in the perfect timing, and it doesn&#039;t destroy the narrative or the visual. The story is balanced in the perfect sense of the word. <br />
<br />
One last advice, please read the line messages, there are some translations if you don&#039;t know Japanese, they are short stories about the relationship and will add more ideas about it. You could try to guess if they are related to them or not :P <br />
<br />
You should try to watch it if you like romance stories and a slice of the life stories. If you are seeking fights, actions or anything different, you should skip this anime. <br />

    An anime about the pure, innocent, and slow-pacing love of the adolescence page in our lives that we can relate to. This show can bring back nostalgia about how dumbfounded we had been when we experienced love in the middle school.<br />

The art style is very unique with the watercolor palette and will be very distinguishable at the first episode. It’s fitting in the general feel of the show, which is like the reminiscent of our youth days. There’s a lot of great sceneries which somewhat akin to what Makoto Shinkai’s produced in his works.<br />
 <br />
The soundtracks help a lot in creating the atmosphere of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246118">
        scene and are noteworthy. The OP is beautiful yet exciting, the same goes to the ED and insert songs (though both are calmer). All in all, the sounds are working in concert with the art to create a delightful duo for our senses.<br />
<br />
Both of the main characters seem like dandere because of how shy they are except with the ones they’re close to. This helps create heartwarming awkward moments between the two of them. Other supporting characters also show interesting premise for future episodes.<br />
<br />
The slow-paced nature of this show may turn away some people off, but actually it’s the strong point. It also occasionally surprises us with the sudden increment of development in the story. This anime might be a hidden gem in this season or maybe this year because of how down-to-earth it is and it might refreshes our not-so-pure self with something as innocent as this.<br />

    EDIT: Although I still stand by everything I said before, as the story advances, I want to say more, namely I really want to emphasize that this show is truly beautiful and special, it&#039;s real and honest and not cluttered with any needless tropes or background noise. Their feelings and circumstances are extremely believable and everything is treated in a very gentle manner. And up to now I have loved every single episode I have seen.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t normally follow a story about middle-schoolers, however I am not sorry I started watching this. It delivers an overall sweet and considerate story, and is the only decent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246100">
        romance anime that this season has to offer us.<br />
<br />
The story is very down to earth, boy meets girl, they gradually get closer. Although the pacing of the anime seems slow (in terms of how the scenes are constructed), I would say that (at least by shoujo standards) things are actually evolving pretty quickly. I like the story because it feels authentic and earnest and because the characters inner life plays a big role. In this age of lolis, anything human and real is to be appreciated.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are of perfectly good quality by modern standards, nothing spectacular, but I feel that lots of attention to detail was invested.<br />
<br />
The characters portray what you would expect from a (no frills) 14-year old. They are discovering the world, dealing with their emotions, interests, desires... they are also quite sweet and shy :)<br />
<br />
I personally am enjoying this series more and more, I find it sincere and refreshing and feel swept into the characters&#039; emotions. If you like this genre of anime, I encourage people to give it a try, the first two or three episodes should convince you.

    *no spoilers*<br />
<br />
As far as this anime is aired, four episodes currently, I am really enjoying it.<br />
This anime is &quot;just&quot; a normal and common slice of life, school, romance anime, but the way it is made is just pure awesomeness. The characters are lovable and the setting is really good. The voices are really calm and fascinating...it just feels good to hear them talk. The anime is really calm and that is one of the reasons why it is so good. You can feel the characters, and everything seems realistic. I highly recommend this anime for school/romance anime fans.<br />
Right now the hype for the next episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246420">
        is strong...^^<br />
In this spring season this is definitely one of the upper anime<br />
But be prepared for moments that make you think &quot;OMG, this is so accurate&quot; and a lot of sighs by the main character xD<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this review was helpful

    Aah, I wish someone told me before I started watching this that it&#039;s SoL on ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIDS. <br />
<br />
NOTE: Before going any further, I just want to disclose that I&#039;m not the biggest fan of SoL, especially when comedy is sparse. So just remember that this is from a perspective of someone who generally tends to avoid these types of shows. Also, I&#039;ll be diving into spoilers, as I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to convey why I just couldn&#039;t stuff last 2 episodes otherwise. So, with that said, let&#039;s get this over with.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
<br />
Now, I could write something generic here, like &quot;well, truly, there is no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256682">
        story&quot; or something along the lines of &quot;whatever little story there is, it sucks&quot;, but the problem with Tsuki ga Kirei runs much, much deeper when it comes to the general narrative. Not only is it pretty cliche in terms of where plot points begin, how they climax and where they end, but it is absolutely ruined by its snail-slow pace. Now, again, this is one of the reasons why I tend to dislike SoLs in the first place: lack of forthcoming narrative. I believe that all stories should have, well, a story. It doesn&#039;t have to be epic. It doesn&#039;t have to invoke thunder-like emotions. But, it has to have a story. Otherwise, it&#039;s just a string of sketches, and it has no point. And that&#039;s the problem with Tsuki ga Kirei: it has no point. <br />
<br />
For an example, first 2 episodes (~40 minutes), have about 5 minutes of material in the terms of narrative. Which is why nearly every new scene has like 15 establishing shots for no reason. 5 minutes of narrative, with absolutely no comedy worth a dime, stretched to 40 minutes run time. I don&#039;t understand. What&#039;s the point? Is this supposed to convey some deeper meaning I&#039;m missing? Is it about how life is truly mundane and how little to nothing happens in our daily lives? Perhaps. Maybe that was the intention. However, there are better ways to convey this, and stretching it to 40 minutes certainly isn&#039;t a way. Maybe there&#039;s even more to it, but I&#039;m not seeing it. I just kept trying to fill in the blanks with my own imagination, but I don&#039;t feel like it was supposed to go that way. <br />
<br />
From episode 2 onward, this speeds up somewhat, but the whole narrative is so bare bones that nothing of true consequence happens. First and foremost, what&#039;s even the point of this story? It can&#039;t be coming of age story, as characters aren&#039;t old enough for that. It can&#039;t be relaxing romance because it&#039;s boring. It can&#039;t be comedy because it&#039;s not. It can&#039;t be melodrama because it has no drama. Is it really just &#039;daily lives of middle school kids who kinda like each other for some reason and decide to date&#039;? If you ever took classes on storytelling, the very first thing you&#039;ll learn is to avoid cliches. Second is that your story generally needs to have a threefold structure: incisive beginning, cumulative climax and natural ending. Whether it&#039;s in the terms of the entire narrative or just short arcs within it, if you decide to stray from this formula, you better have dozens of years of experience when it comes to writing, or whatever you do will amount to nothing. Which is the case here.<br />
<br />
In terms of romance here, I don&#039;t get it. Ayame and Azuki have no chemistry. They are just awkward teens that kind of decide to date. And I mean really &#039;awkward&#039; of the &#039;awkward&#039; kind. They&#039;re both shy, indecisive, reclusive, silent. These couples are some of the worst to write about because they have nothing captivating about them. Who will ever say that Ayame or Azuki, as individuals, are great, or even memorable, characters? No one. This isn&#039;t the case of two terribles making something great, just enhancing their template terribleness even further. All the moments they share are stuffed to shit with silence and awkward glances. I get it. That&#039;s how teens are. However, it&#039;s not interesting. Whenever we reminiscence of teen days, we don&#039;t talk about awkward relationships where nothing of consequence happened because even we forgot about it. And that&#039;s another problem here: nothing is memorable. <br />
<br />
They don&#039;t have a moment together where you go &#039;haaah I&#039;ll remember that for good while&#039;. Even their &#039;kiss&#039; scene is cluttered with &#039;artsy&#039; foreground and background to the point that the focus of the entire scene is indiscernible. I get what the show was going for, I really do. It aimed to convey the awkward days, the innocence of youth, but there&#039;s a reason why every other show that does this adds more to it: it&#039;s because that concept can&#039;t stand on its own. Hell, even in movie form, it can&#039;t stand on its own, let alone for 12 episodes. As someone who generally hates &#039;drama for the sake of drama&#039; in shows, I was PRAYING for something to happen, anything. But even when it did, the show played it so safe I wondered what the hell was the point. <br />
<br />
Okay, I feel like I rattled on about the story for a bit too long. I&#039;ll probably get back to it when I get to the characters, but, for the time being, let&#039;s move on.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
<br />
Art has two sides: good and bad. Whenever there are only a few characters on screen, it&#039;s pretty decent. The pointless white highlights on every character were unnecessary and distracting, but it was okay. The show does have some decent moments (my favorite scene is actually the opening scene as it pans over rather interesting architecture), and bolsters some pretty decent background work.<br />
<br />
However, it all falls apart whenever we see a group of people. CG people. It clashes with background far too much, it&#039;s amateurish, it&#039;s absolutely ugly, and even people casually watching it will notice. And, as the show loves to have 26 establishing shots for every scene, you can bet your sweet ass that those CG monstrosities will be showing up in every episode. I know it&#039;s expensive to animate such scenes, but at least put some effort into CG. If you can&#039;t handle it, don&#039;t try to go for the &#039;impressive&#039; perspective to awe the viewer when details ruin the entire scene.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, it&#039;s similar to art. It has some competent animation, especially when it comes to running/dancing, but outside of it it&#039;s pretty basic. There were several atrocious scenes when people were running outside of track, but animation is salvaged somewhat with the aforementioned background work, as I oftentimes just ignored the characters altogether and looked for details in the scenery around them. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
By far the best part of the entire anime. Even if exclude those random 2 music videos that show up because, well, episodes gotta be 20 minutes and holy shit how else are we gonna make that happen, sound on the whole was good. Music accompanied the scenes properly and it set the mood the show was going for. To be honest, most scenes that should otherwise be completely terrible were oftentimes salvaged by the music alone. It may be just me, but I generally tend to like slow piano pieces, which this show has plenty of, so it sat with me well. Not much else to say, really.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d love to comment on VA&#039;s, but I bet half their scripts read &#039;uh&#039; &#039;ah&#039; &#039;umm&#039; &#039;eh&#039;, so why even bother? <br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
<br />
As is the norm with these half-assed attempts at making romance of generic teens appealing, the show focuses on the 2 least interesting characters of its entire cast. Why? Why do these shows do this? Why focus on literally the most boring aspect of your narrative? I don&#039;t know. Maybe, again, it&#039;s some metaphor that reflects our own lives, maybe it&#039;s just something I don&#039;t get because I can&#039;t relate to it, but I was far more intrigued with everything else except our leading duo. <br />
<br />
Azumi is defined like this: shy guy who writes.<br />
Akame is defined like this: shy girl who runs. <br />
<br />
There. That&#039;s the characterization. There&#039;s no depth to them and, whatever depth there appears to be, is just teen angst rearing its ugly face. They are defined by their hobbies and their base characteristic. Relationships between two shy people are AMAZING for two shy people, but they&#039;re some of the most boring relationships to look at as the third party, especially when you have to stretch it over 12 episodes. <br />
<br />
Again, it may be me missing some deeper narrative, but I highly doubt it. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s me missing deeper narrative, but it&#039;s simply not a show meant for me. I get that. I&#039;m not 14 anymore and, if I&#039;m being frank, I hate my 14y old self. I&#039;m pretty much full-fledged adult at this point, and these &#039;cutesy&#039; &#039;coming of age&#039; stories just don&#039;t do it for me anymore, especially if they&#039;re so lacking in comedy. I enjoy seeing relationships, not awkward attempts at them. I enjoy seeing characters that brim with &#039;character&#039;, not two stick-dolls who can barely hit &#039;audible&#039; in terms of volume of their voices. I enjoy narrative with a point, not attempt at basic pandering. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t understand why this show is rated so highly. I don&#039;t understand why its characters and narrative and &#039;message&#039; are so praised. They&#039;re basic. Take every &#039;awkward couple&#039; of every romance anime, and you have it. Honestly, I even found Kimi no Todoke less boring, and it&#039;s not like Kimi no Todoke is epitome of even passable narrative. The reason I found it less boring is because it had comedy. Its characters bounced off of each other to create the comedic narrative because it was lacking elsewhere. However, Tsuki ga Kirei doesn&#039;t have that. I think I chuckled maybe once during their interactions. Was that the point? Maybe. I&#039;m generally not the type to say &#039;oh, it&#039;s fine as long as you enjoyed it&#039;, as that statement encourages more of the same. I want aggressive, challenging stories. I want characters with depth, and I want to see them tackle issues in accordance to their character. There&#039;s none of that here. <br />
<br />
Even though I&#039;ve been shitting on our main couple, it&#039;s not like side characters are any better if I&#039;m being honest. This mainly stems from the fact that we don&#039;t see them often enough. I don&#039;t get it, though. Pretty much every episode has at least 3-4 minutes of establishing shots, so why not just use it to give your side characters SOMETHING? Those post-credit bits aren&#039;t enough. It&#039;s like the creators realized that the story lacked that comedic narrative, and just slapped some randomly irrelevant comedic bits in the end and said &#039;great, let&#039;s do it like this&#039;. <br />
<br />
When that Chizu whatever best friend asked our MG &#039;can I confess to your boyfriend&#039;, I was honestly looking forward to their fallout. Not because &#039;I choose my 1week BF over my BFF&#039;, but because that&#039;s just not something you do as BFF. But nope. Why have SOMETHING interesting happen, when we can have 83 establishing shots of pointless scenes instead? <br />
<br />
Tsuki ga Kirei is jam packed with nothing. It&#039;s a string of mundane events that offer no depth. It&#039;s an attempt at &#039;ordinary coming of age story&#039; that fails to understand that ordinary doesn&#039;t equal boring and uninteresting. I spent most of my summer vacation at home, and I had way more fun than any of these characters. And that&#039;s just fucking sad. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t enjoy the show, far from it, but I&#039;d lie if I said there isn&#039;t any merit to it. Young people nowadays lack shows like this, and I appreciate that about the show. Doesn&#039;t mean I excuse all its shortcomings, but still, it&#039;s something. It&#039;s a show that tells young people that it&#039;s okay to be boring and ordinary. And, even if I disagree with that, I can see its point. At least it&#039;s better than your generic harem and echii crap, so if you&#039;re gonna watch something, at least watch this over that. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know how the show ends. I&#039;ll probably never find out. I&#039;ve been skipping scenes since episode 4, and stuffing through 40 more minutes is just not something I can do (well, 50 more minutes, as I just quit halfway through ep. 10). Whether it ends in a happy, sad or bittersweet fashion, I don&#039;t care because I don&#039;t care for the main characters. Whether their dreams come true or not, I don&#039;t care. They&#039;re 14. What the fuck are they thinking is going to happen? I don&#039;t know. <br />
<br />
That pretty much summarizes my &#039;thoughts about the show&#039;: I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know whether there&#039;s some deeper narrative that I&#039;m missing because I&#039;m not the target audience (both in terms of the genres and in terms of the characters). I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s deeper meaning to the show&#039;s lack of any form of narrative. I don&#039;t know whether CG people are supposed to represent how our society is robotic, or whether it&#039;s just cheaper to make it that way. I don&#039;t know whether I&#039;m dead inside, or it&#039;s just the show. I just... don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
<br />
Whichever it may be, I know this isn&#039;t a show I&#039;d recommend to anyone. Perhaps, if I was 14, I might have enjoyed the show more. But, I doubt it. I was very much different when I was 14 than our main duo, or even any other side character present here. It may be just me, and the show is truly a masterpiece that I&#039;ll never get, but at least from the technical standpoint of the writing, the show is not good. It has terrible pace. It lacks proper narrative. It uses bare bone foreshadowing (ep. 3 oh, we might be moving to Chiba = it&#039;s gonna be a major plot point for the couple later on. Whoever missed this... eh, whatever), it&#039;s stuffed with nothing, it doesn&#039;t have decently written characters, and myriad of other things that I&#039;m probably forgetting, because I&#039;m already forgetting the show itself. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as bad as, say, Your Lie in April, but it&#039;s definitely far more boring than it. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s really all I wanted to say. Maybe I&#039;m truly turning into an old man... I just... don&#039;t know.

           Tsuki ga Kirei is like an embarrassing flashback to those days in middle school where you wanted to grow up as fast as possible and do things all the cool adults did. Remember that first time you fell in love from looking at someone, but didn’t know what to do or didn’t have the guts to try it out? Yeah, Tsuki ga Kirei is just a reminder what should’ve or could’ve happened for all those with regrets from their younger days. Tsuki ga Kirei is everything I wanted Kuzu no Honkai to be, the characters are brimming with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251474">
        personality, the visual storytelling is off the charts, and there is more to it than just a love story. Each character has their own aspirations and there is substance to why they exist. I’m glad the show takes its subject matter seriously, because there’s not a lot of room for comedic relief and gags in a show trying to express how difficult young love is. Characters have insecurities and can’t explain why they feel a certain way to specific people. Tsuki ga Kirei does a great job showing how young people can make relationships work without needing a reason.<br />
	<br />
First of all, the story is basically what the synopsis is saying. However, that is just a hair of what Tsuki ga Kirei is trying to express. It goes without saying that we are going to see these characters mature, as they are in their adolescence stage. But just the cringy awkwardness of character interactions and difference in personalities depending on settings just show that the writers care a little bit more about portraying the life of adolescent teenagers taking the next step in life. Besides even showing the romance between our main characters, (which I think is its weakest link) the development each character gets leads to satisfying results. The show doesn’t hold back in regards to losing out. No doubt by the end of this anime, we see characters mature and become their own person. The process of getting to that point makes Tsuki ga Kirei different from other anime in the romance drama/ coming of age anime.  <br />
<br />
	The characters are all full of life and are definitely the high point of this anime. The character interactions in this are what you’d expect from middle schoolers ready to get into their naïve “we will be together forever!” stage. However, it’s a joy seeing how characters think about other things other than this character or meaningless gossip. Of course, gossip plays a part in the story, but there isn’t anything overly dramatic where it forces an interaction like for example the main guy saving the main girl from girls talking about her behind her back. What we get are characters listening to what peers say and coming to the realization that it’s not a bad thing to fall in love with this certain someone. While it’s really cheesy, the portrayal of these real-life scenarios is what really makes these characters shine. There ends up being a love triangle in this Tsuki ga Kirei, but instead of the really cringy “let things flow” that anime does, the characterization really shows through these scenes. Instead of letting it go, characters resolve themselves to see it through to the end and it just makes me feel so bad because it makes me regret seeing these young kids do what I couldn’t (it also makes me feel great). Seeing every character go beyond their roles is what gave me the most enjoy watching Tsuki ga Kirei. <br />
<br />
	The visual presentation of Tsuki ga Kirei was really breathtaking sometimes. It’s use of angles and scenes with no words but animation created powerful scenes. Accompanied with the music, it really brings out the mood and atmosphere of whatever scene we’re watching. Of course, the animation itself isn’t that great, there are instances of awful CG characters and some sloppy animating of the main characters, but all can be forgiven because the most powerful scenes were the best animated. Also, the music really brings out the charm in some of the romantic scenes. It’s excellent how the animations and music mesh together and it’s almost rare nowadays to see anime express themselves like this.   <br />
	I also really liked the skits at the end of the first 7-9 episodes, they were funny to watch and just that little bit of screen time makes me think of characters I would otherwise not even bat an eye to after they’re off the screen. They were also just a slight, but effective addition to the overall narrative Tsuki ga Kirei is going for, so I’ll accept them. <br />
<br />
Side Note: too bad Chinatsu was the weakest link in all this.<br />
<br />
	All in all, Tsuki ga Kirei impressed me. The setting and age of the characters leaves the anime vulnerable to pandering, but Tsuki ga Kirei went above that and elevated itself above most romance anime by taking its subject matter seriously and not making a joke of it. The empathy I got from watching these characters struggle is what lead me to believe that the writers didn’t joke around when it comes to adolescent love. The satisfaction I got from watching characters talk out their problems and resolving themselves for hard decisions is what really made me like these characters. The plot also has decent substance without using that much exposition, as previously said. The directing was very good and projected the characters emotions very well. The overall package of Tsuki ga Kirei created a very enjoyable experience for me and proves to me that anime can still be expressive and creative in ways live action movies can’t.<br />

    &quot;No matter how far we are apart, my feelings for her will never change. Leaving for an unfamiliar town. And I&#039;ll always love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but this anime is an exception. It is one of feel’s original anime. I watched this because one of my friends recommended it to me. I was a little skeptical at first, as I thought it would be a boring, cliche high school romance anime. Also, it was my first time watching an anime from feel studio. But I binged it anyway and I LOVE IT VERY MUCH!<br />
<br />
STORY [10/10]<br />
Let&#039;s start from the story. This anime has the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397948">
        most realistic romantic story I&#039;ve ever watched. The plot is also simple for beginners. If you&#039;re a high schooler, I&#039;m pretty sure that you can relate to this anime so much, especially if you have a crush on someone from your class. The story built up pretty well and I love the progression and development of the main characters. This anime also had dramas that I think everyone who&#039;s in a relationship would understand and relate to. It started with a normal boy in high school with no more than two best friends. He liked one of the girls in his class. They were completely different. One liked to hang around the library to read books, and the other one liked to run in tracks. They rarely talk to each other, even though they both had feelings toward each other. The boy finally had the courage to ask the girl out, and the girl gave her response the other day. They were dating, but none of them knows how to do a proper date. They got closer as the episode continued. Later in the episode, they had their first drama. One of the girl&#039;s best friends liked her boyfriend, and on the other side, one of her friends from tracking liked her. The second drama was that the girl had to move to another high school as her dad had a job in an unfamiliar city, so they both had to suffer a long distance relationship. They both successfully face the drama, married at the end and had a baby. I cried so much at the ending scene, even though it&#039;s a happy ending. It&#039;s pure love, everyone. A solid ten from me.<br />
<br />
ART [9/10]<br />
I&#039;m not really familiar with the art style as it was my first time watching an anime from feel, but I have to say that I like the art style. It&#039;s not the best out there, yet I can still enjoy the anime with the style. I wouldn&#039;t talk much on this part. All you have to know is that this anime has a great art style. I give it a nine.<br />
<br />
SOUND [9/10]<br />
I don&#039;t really have to talk much about the sound of this anime. It&#039;s great! It all sounds realistic and I love it very much. As for the opening and the ending, both of them are on my Spotify playlist, so you can get an idea of how much I love them, especially the ending. I cried all throughout the ending, as it has deep meanings that you can understand if you already watched it. This ending hits different in the last episode. When the boy shouted &#039;Daisuki&#039; and the song played right after that, I literally got goosebumps. Even after I finished the show, I still get the same goosebumps everytime I rewatched the ending scene. A nine from me!<br />
<br />
CHARACTER [8/10]<br />
They&#039;re good, but not the best. The anime focuses most on the main characters. Somehow, the main characters in this anime look so normal that it almost looks like a side character. There&#039;s nothing special about the boy nor the girl. They&#039;re not waifu materials lol, so don&#039;t get your hopes up. But either way, the characters in this anime have great personalities. They are unique in their own way. On top of that, I still love the characters in the anime. I give it a decent eight.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT [10/10]<br />
The enjoyment. As I said, I love this anime so much, so there will be no doubt that I enjoy this anime as a whole. There&#039;s nothing to talk about in this section. I give it another solid ten.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a masterpiece that I would recommend everyone to watch. It&#039;s the best romance anime I&#039;ve ever watched along with Horimiya hands down. This anime has a bittersweet ending, and it gave me goosebumps. I also cried so much that I can&#039;t hold it anymore. Everytime I come back to the ending, I always have the same kind of reaction and feelings. All of the aspects of the anime blend perfectly. Some said it&#039;s boring, but I really love this kind of anime. It&#039;s an amazing anime all throughout. I&#039;m not into harem romance, so this anime once again is a masterpiece. There&#039;s no anime like this, so you should all watch it. A SOLID TEN OVERALL! THANK ME LATER!<br />
<br />
Note: I suggest you watch the last episode until the end and try to not skip the credit scene.<br />

    Tsuki ga Kirei was an anime that I overlooked back in 2017, and I regret doing that. The show is unique and does the opposite of what most romance anime currently airing do.<br />
<br />
Most current romance anime consist of large drama and romantic rivals that create a complex love web that the main character has to fight in to declare his love. They normally have these difficult situations the characters have to band together to get over. Sure there were some situations for the characters to get over, but they were all very real and there weren’t as many. The show uses simpler techniques to get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363231">
        an emotion out of you. They use changes in the characters&#039; way of speaking with each other, changes in voice acting, amazing background music, and the lack of music in scenes create a mood to make you understand and get attached to the characters and story.<br />
<br />
The story of Tsuki ga Kirei is a simple one. It follows both protagonists, Azumi and Akane, and their journey to do what they love while holding up a relationship and falling in love. They both struggle with maintaining both and having a clear mindset. Their mindsets are also shown with quotes from “Osamu Dazai,” a legendary novelist from the early to mid-1900s. There is no big drama or other things to really distract you from the romance plot. This further highlights the amazingly presented story and lets the show have 12 episodes while making you extremely invested in the characters.<br />
<br />
The pacing was really good. As stated earlier, this is mainly due to the straightforward storytelling and lack of drama from outside of the relationship. It felt like 12 episodes were all they needed and they used them effectively. Back to Dazai’s quotes, they also use this to show where they are in their relationship. I may be jumping now, but during the ed, you see a moon that slowly becomes a full moon, representing the growth of their relationship.<br />
<br />
The show focuses on Azumi and Akane. Azumi is someone who wants to be a writer. It’s his dream, and you see him constantly reading works and practicing often to try to improve. He is shown to grow throughout the story and mature at the pace he’s supposed to. He’s going into high school and is trying to get a new grasp on the world. They present this amazingly, by not including extra unnecessary information about his character, so you can grow attached and understand the principle of his character.<br />
<br />
Akane is a smart and athletic girl who is running on the track team. She is someone that has to deal with constantly moving around due to her dad’s job, so she can’t fully build relationships with people. She also struggles with constant failures on the track, even though you see her put so much time and effort into improving her time and having success when not in an actual competition. She deals with anxiety and has this potato plush that she squishes whenever she gets nervous.<br />
<br />
Both of these characters feel very much like actual children and enhance each other as they grow together. These realistic characters allow you to enjoy the 12 episodes you spend with them. You won’t get annoyed at them since they are young, real children that were created to be efficient and not have much outside of what’s necessary.<br />
The side characters were also really good. They helped provide some substance for the small situations, and even some for the larger (not really that large) ones. The parents were some of the more important of the supporting characters, which is rare. They supported or went against the main characters’ wishes. They acted like their kids were what they wanted, but also supported them, just like what a real parent should and could be.<br />
<br />
The art style in Tsuki ga Kirei was beautiful. It had white outlines for the character, with great colour palettes. It was simple yet beautiful. The animation on the other hand suffered a bit. It was kinda eh. There were a lot of CGI crowds and other things that took you out of the moment.<br />
<br />
The sound design in Tsuki ga Kirei was immaculate. The voice acting was extremely believable. The characters sounded young and their age. They portrayed so much emotion in their lines and it really brought out their characters. In each episode, the characters’ speech changed a little bit when they talked to each other. From the start with their awkwardness around each other to the end where you can hear the cries in their voices.<br />
<br />
The OST was also amazing. It contained extremely well-composed music, with an occasional vocal insert every now and then. They really had some emotional music that complemented the scenes extremely well, which makes the OST very memorable for me.<br />
<br />
The op was pretty emotional, especially as you go on throughout the show. You feel the beat-drop more and more as the episodes pass.<br />
<br />
The ed was better than the op in my opinion. It was beautifully presented, showing the relationship between Akane and Azumi grow throughout the story, and I can never forget that last episode.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show provides you with a simple story and characters, built with depth, as realistic and efficient as possible. It provided immaculate sound design, soundtracks, voice acting, and emotional moments. The only flaw is a small budget that couldn’t provide the animation needed to heighten the emotion.

    Are you Interested in a change of pace? Want something out of the norm? Something that&#039;s different from previous romance titles but still leaves a large impact on the viewer. If so then I would highly suggest watching something else. I went into this anime hoping that it would progress in a manner I am not used to but it failed to impress let alone entertain me for the majority of the season. Typical intro where the main character meets a girl who he doesn&#039;t know and for whatever reason they&#039;re instantly drawn to each other. A clichéd intro like this had me feeling as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252070">
        if I was going to be watching another typical shoujo anime. And boy was I right. That&#039;s not to say that the anime is horrendous, the art style is interesting and the sound is fair. The characters however, did not leave much of an impact on me at all. I felt as though I was actually watching supporting characters rather than regular characters in a story(if that makes any sense). It feels as though the characters were there because they needed to be not necessarily because they were meant to or because they fit in well. This review comes from someone who watches romance anime more often than any other genre and the rating this anime has still continues to baffle me in comparison to some of my more favorable titles. I do have to give the creators some credit because they did manage to construct a pretty eventful story in only 12 episodes without it feeling rushed, the story itself however, could&#039;ve used some polishing. Check it out though, you might disagree.

    “People exist for love and revolution.” - Osamu Dazai <br />
<br />
🥇 9/10<br />
At first glance, Tsuki ga Kirei might look like a simple love story of middle-school students, but this show has something more than just a romance story to offer to audiences. Watching Tsuki ga Kirei is like becoming a middle-schooler once again, but this time in Japan, giving audiences a chance to experience such a beautiful culture of Japan.<br />
<br />
🎬 Story - 7/10<br />
The story is mainly about a relationship between a shy novelist introverted boy and an athlete girl, set place in Japan, mostly in middle school. The story is simple, not being too plain. Unlike

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337070">
        many other shows, the story of this show seems to be based on reality, trying to be most realistic as possible. By doing that, the story risks being too plain, however, it actually went well. Despite having calm and slow storytelling, it was not boring at all. I love how small details are being focused, the story is also being spiced up by Japanese culture, erasing almost all of its plainness. Throughout the story, there might be some irritating moments, but they ended well, so I did not mind. As for the ending, I am pretty satisfied, however, it somewhat left a story hole there.<br />
<br />
🎨 Animation - 8/10<br />
Tsuki ga Kirei has a watercolor art style, which is nice, matching the calm mood and tone of the show. Overall pretty high quality, but the 3D model usage on background characters is being obviously noticeable, terribly ruining the rest of the art in some scenes.<br />
<br />
🔈 Sound - 10/10<br />
Simply amazing and stunning. The opening and ending suit the overall mood and tone of the show, as well as insert songs, having an impact on audiences. Soundtracks are also done very well.<br />
<br />
🕶 Characters - 10/10<br />
According to the story, the concept is trying to be as realistic as possible. Let’s start with the character design, characters are designed to be simple, almost plain, without fancy hairstyles or colors (except Roman, probably intentional hair dyeing), which follows the concept as being realistic. Despite being plain, I find almost no character confusion.<br />
<br />
Character personalities are understandable, as there is no reaction exaggerating. Happiness, shyness, nervousness, anger, sadness, all seem real. Some people may dislike how shy and quiet characters are, saying that boring and would not work in a relationship, but that is what I liked. It seems real, getting to see how that would actually work out.<br />
<br />
Character development is surprisingly good. Despite having a slow storytelling, character development is greatly recognized. The relationship between characters is getting developed throughout the series without rushing. Furthermore, not only the school and romance side of characters are being told, but also their family, activities, interests, basically their personal life. <br />
<br />
Lastly, supporting characters are also not being too bland, at the end of each episode, also in Tsuki ga Kirei Special, comedic shorts about supporting characters are included, giving a feeling that they are not being left out.<br />
<br />
🎉 Enjoyment - 9/10<br />
I enjoy literally almost every moment of the show. Even though there were some irritating moments, but they later were followed by somewhat satisfying ones. Things I enjoyed the most were art style, insert songs, Japanese culture, and how realistic the show is. What I did not enjoy were some cheap-made 3D character models and a hole at the ending. However, those flaws were almost nothing compared to the things that this show has to offer.<br />
<br />
📌 Recommendations<br />
Since this show contains many obvious characteristics of Japan and Japanese culture, it is recommended to at least understand some of the Japanese cultures prior to watching this show, especially about love, or the show may leave you confused. Lastly, if you are looking for a non-comedic romance anime, then I recommend this anime. Enjoy!

    Never in my life have I ever been able to relate to a character like I can relate to Kotarou. This is the first time I think I’ve felt this personally connected to a character. Sure the characters I have on my favourites lists are ones that I like, but none of them are like me. Kotarou however, has so many thoughts that I myself have experienced in my lifetime. <br />
<br />
Not only is Kotarou the only relatable aspect of this show, but the way Akane and our other characters act and express emotion is so crazily realistic, and that’s what I love so much about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389916">
        Tsuki ga Kirei. It doesn’t require any fancy concepts or crazy plot in order to be a beautiful anime, how simplistic and realistic it is, is enough. The facial expressions of Akane and Kotarou are something I truly treasured while watching and after watching.<br />
<br />
The awkwardness you get from having conversations with unfamiliar people you want to get to know is something that I really am able to relate to on a real level, and I think it’s something that most people can relate to as well. As the Moon, so Beautiful doesn’t make the characters seem like they’re on a different level as us, but instead puts us on the same level as them, which is something surprisingly unique. This can especially be seen when the main characters excitedly await a text from one another, I also love when Kotarou plunges into his bed or his pillow because this is exactly something I do everytime.<br />
<br />
I got extremely emotionally attached towards the end of the show in episode 12, seeing Akane-chan and Kotarou-kun so weak and vulnerable, once again puts them on the same level as us. One thing I felt like I missed out on was a big hug between them, I enjoyed the kissing scenes a whole bunch, but I really wanted to see Kotarou give Akane a big teddy bear hug from behind, especially during episode 11 when Akane broke down. Nevertheless, I was still extremely satisfied with the intimacy between Azumi and Mizuno we got to see.<br />
<br />
The realism in both the Mizuno and Azumi families we see is really touching. I loved every part of the sisterly connection Akane and Ayane have with one another, in fact I was really joyous to see Akane talk to Ayane about her relationship. In the Mizuno family we are reminded of how important parents are to us, not having that support from a family member can be extremely groundbreaking for people. <br />
<br />
The art is actually really amazing. It’s unique not to a fault, and has some amazing scenery throughout the entire series. I personally like how Mizuno and Azumi look, and I could not imagine them looking different. It’s really simplistic, which perfectly describes and represents this anime as a whole.<br />
<br />
Music is used prolifically throughout the show, it’s pretty subtle at times and again is extremely simplistic. At times there is no music, but instead just sound effects. This is probably the first anime I’ve watched where I really focused and noticed the sound effects. The squish of the little squeezie, the wind chimes in episode 8, the breeze in episode 11, it’s all applied perfectly to fit their respective scenes. Voice actors, WOOWHEEE. I really loved Akane’s voice actor, the “mm” Akane does is so stupidly cute and attractive.<br />
<br />
There is some incredible character development in this series, mainly demonstrated in Kotarou-kun and Akane-chan. Kotarou is an extraordinary character. Out of all the characters in this show I definitely can relate to Kotarou the most, and for that reason he is amazing. Akane is a wonderfully beautiful character that makes me smile a bunch. I love that she runs track, just like I do, and although there isn’t too much of an emphasis on what she feels when she runs, I still can relate to her as a fellow track and field athlete. Not only do we get amazing main characters, but our supporting characters are really amazing as well. Hira and Chinatsu both like our respective main characters and they demonstrate the struggle people feel when the people they’re in love with are in love with somebody else. Tachibana has a decently large amount of screentime, but doesn’t get very much development. That being said, Tachibana is a crucial character in this series, and without him Akane and Kotarou don’t get closer that quickly.<br />
<br />
Tsuki ga Kirei is a prime example of one of those shows that don’t need insanely profound themes to be absolutely amazing. It doesn’t stand out from the crowd, but somehow managed to be an extremely unique experience for me. This might not be for everybody, but if you’re someone who&#039;s into school-life, this is definitely something for you. I think this show is very surprisingly unpopular, and underappreciated, which is stellar considering the 8.17 score it has on MAL.<br />

    School life romance is quite popular in the Japanese anime industry. Kimi ni Todoke, Clannad, Shigatsu and even the acclaimed Kimi no Na wa is about school romance. Despite the fact that the popularity of anime school romance is sky-high like the Eiffel tower. As an affirmed still-a-virgin individual, I could proudly confirm you one thing : &quot;I never get bored of this cycle, and I most likely never will as long as I remain a virgin.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tsuki ga Kirei ( The Moon is Beautiful, As the Moon, So Beautiful ) is an anime that exploits the factors of school life romance beyond the boundaries.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318922">
        In spite of the fact that the story of the anime is solely about a boy and a girl falling in love with one another. Mmm..How can I explain this. Alright, envision you have a bowl of ramen in front of you. It’s already good. However, you can add more flavor into it until it suits your taste. Tsuki ga Kirei is exactly like that. For a better example. Let’s just say that Tsuki ga Kirei has a staggeringly well-developed story and characters. Despite the fact that the concept of the anime is pretty much just about two students falling in love. <br />
<br />
I found this anime around the time when I began watching Violet Evergarden. My first impression after I saw the anime&#039;s cover was &quot;Aw shucks. Probably a CG-only anime. I&#039;d probably never watch it in my entire life. Ugh. I&#039;ll include it in my PTW anyways.&quot;. After time passes, I turn out to become more intrigued about the anime. Why is the rating so high? Why are the reviews so positive? Is it really all-CG? was the three main questions I asked myself each time I scroll up and down my PTW list to find an anime to watch. <br />
<br />
After more than half a year of persistence to watch this anime. I finally gathered my courage and began watching. And well. Fuck. The anime was unexpectedly decent. I continuously watched the episodes. Rarely stopping due to how addictive the anime was, and cried my ass off several times around the 3-2 final episodes.. I have accidently judged something by its cover again.. <br />
<br />
On account of the perfectly developed story and characters. As well as excellent art style and quality. And furthermore the catchy OP, ed and exquisite ambient music as well as sound effects. This anime has turned into my number one school romance anime. With no negative feedback at all because I can&#039;t think of one (It&#039;s already impeccable in my point of view ).<br />
<br />
Tsuki ga Kirei is a MASTERPIECE! I won&#039;t say it twice since I don&#039;t have a clue whether my feelings towards this anime will gradually fall like the others. Anyways. I recommend this anime to y’all out there who loves romance anime. This is a must watch. That is all. Thank you for reading my review. <br />

    &quot;It&#039;s not being in love that makes me happy. It is the person that i am in love with that does&quot;<br />
<br />
Story of romance sometimes are pretty generic. We see a boy and a girl fallin in love with each other then they meet some obstacle in their relationship but somehow can manage it and happy end. But of course, the differences is how they would wrap that generic story and for me, Tsuki ga Kirei have take to a whole new level of it.<br />
<br />
Brought to you by the director of famous anime, Angel Beats. The story is pretty much generic but what makes Tsuki ga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247685">
        Kirei interesting is how they deliver the story. When we see the first second of the anime, one things that would come to our mind is &#039;relatable&#039; like have you ever fallin in love with someone without any reason? and doesnt have much courage to talk with them so u just can look at him/her in a distance? for some people, they can relate this kind of romance story when they were in Junior High School like you are shy to hold your partner&#039;s hand or doesnt have any courage to talk with your crush or partner in the school. For me, i can relate to all that stuff so i can feel what the main characters feels in each scenes.<br />
<br />
Along with it, there is kind of a refreshment to see how the romance develop between each characters. Because your main characters (Azumi Kotarou) isnt some of playboy with outgoing personality but a timid-literature-nerd boy who just experiencing the first love of his life and the same case for the heroine (Mizuno Akane), she is an active girl but when it comes to love she becomes timid. How they will make their relationship become much better is one of things that makes this anime interesting to see more.<br />
<br />
However, the story progress is quite slow and maybe it will bore some people but this kind of approach is suitable for romance series anime because we will see much detail about their story or background and it can increase the tense that happen in some scenes.<br />
<br />
The art in this anime is perfectly suit with the pure romance themes. The watercolour pallete they use are deepening the mellow atmosphere and really suitable with story. The background also pleasing to see like it&#039;s kind of Makoto Shinkai works but instead using sharp colour they&#039;re using subtle and watercolour pallete. Though not many people get used with this kind of art.<br />
<br />
Overall, i found this anime is enjoyable to watch and so far is still interesting to see what happens next. This anime maybe would be a hidden gem in this season if they still continuing with kind of pace and have a kind of twist in the end.

    Spoilers ahead. <br />
<br />
Interesting premise, interesting characters, a serious plot about teenagers having to overcome certain difficulties in life to succeed in whatever they want to succeed in. All in all, it’s a very interesting anime. It’s one of those slow paced anime titles where they go into intricate details about characters and show things instead of dumping exposition in the viewer’s face. An amazing experience to say the least or so I thought. Most of anime titles nowadays are often bloated with needless fan-service, redundant storylines and overall boilerplate characters which you’ve seen a dozen of times in other titles. <br />
<br />
Tsuki ga Kirei stands out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339110">
        as an anime. It stands out because of the uniqueness it introduces and because you actually get to see things as they unfold. The premise is quite simple. The story is about middle school romance and social ineptitude. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy and they fall in love. There is, however, a twist to this and it’s that the boy and the girl are both socially inept meaning they have it difficult with other people.<br />
<br />
The message of Tsuki ga Kirei is unique, as I’ve encountered very few anime titles which actually have a message to its viewers. You have to read behind the lines to understand the story and to get the message. The message is something along the lines of “don’t give up your dreams and hopes for you have only begun your path”. Let me elaborate on this more because it’s an interesting message. It is an interesting message because of the premise. When you’re in middle school, you’re around 14-15 years old. Your life hasn’t even begun and nor are you close on reaching anything in life. You’re far from the truth and the harsh world. Adults know this and know what’s to come for you but you don’t. Your parents often set pressure on you, because they know that you’re capable of reaching anything in life; and the rest of the world also sets pressure on you, or so you think. You have to decide what you’re going to do in life when you’re only 14-15 years of age, in some cultures at least. This is a very difficult decision to make, as you’ve not experienced enough and haven’t done anything but studying and learning new things. This is exactly the case of Tsuki ga Kirei.<br />
<br />
The main character Azumi Kotarou loves literature and aspires to become a writer in the future. He’s still a beginner in writing though and has a lot to learn. He doesn’t give up and continues to follow his dream despite being letdown by others. He’s an interesting character and we get to know him more by his actions, rather than what’s told to us about him. He’s incredibly shy and doesn’t really know how to talk with girls. He likes Mizuno Akane who goes to the same class as him and manages to overcome his shyness to confess his feelings for her. This leads to him having a weird relationship with Akane. Both of these characters are socially inept and are really shy. <br />
<br />
Mizuno Akane is the love interest of Kotarou. She’s a sprinter and loves running more than anything else. She’s incredibly shy as well and has a hard time of telling what’s on her mind to other people. It later becomes a problem for her and she tries her best to deal with difficult situations.<br />
There’s unfortunately not much to say about Akane, she likes sprinting and is extremely shy but tries to battle it in different ways. It isn’t really elaborated as to why Akane is Kotarou’s primary love interest and the one he wants to date.  <br />
<br />
What makes these characters interesting?  They become interesting because we actually get to know them, we see how they interact with each other. We see how difficult it is between them to have their relationship as it’s not really an official one, or rather none of the parts have made it public to others. This is what is interesting about their relationship. This particular aspect raises a lot of questions, questions like why didn’t they openly admit to everyone about their relationship, what is the reasoning, and so on and so forth. I think that most of it succumbs to their shyness. They both seem to have a lot of problems in communicating with others and openly talking about their feelings. This sort of peculiar relationship is what makes this anime stand out even more and makes it unique.<br />
<br />
I cannot say that this is a masterpiece of any kind however. Stories like these have been told since the day of dawn, some bad and some better. The problem I have with this sort of story is the fact how over serious these characters are portrayed as. They behave and act like adults despite being in middle school and being 14 to 15 years of age. They have complex relationships which any sort of teenager wouldn’t be able to understand fully. The main problem I have is how the show is subverting expectations. They introduce these characters as basically adults in a middle school setting however when something goes wrong or not in their favor, they start acting like children. These characters fail to live up to the expectations. <br />
<br />
Kotarou is surely an interesting character but he’s also very lackluster. He aspires to be a writer and is shy. That’s his entire character summed up in one sentence. He doesn’t have any sort of charisma or anything particularly unique about him, yet he somehow manages to spark interest of several girls at the same time. He isn’t a very well established protagonist either because you cannot distinguish him from a random character in the very same show. He likes literature and often quotes famous Japanese poets which honestly comes off as pretentious. <br />
The rest of the cast and other characters are unfortunately not so prevalent in the show. Side characters barely get any screen time and when they do, it’s only for a scene or two in the episode. I would honestly expect more development on the side characters, because they are equally important if not more given the premise. <br />
<br />
This whole premise and the seriousness of characters would be more suitable in a high school setting where characters are finally finishing high school and have to be prepared either for the real life and what’s about to come or university. This high school setting could also potentially introduce other problems that some people experience, as in moving out from your house to study, student loans and debts, saying good bye to your friends which you’ll probably never meet again or ever have the same relationship with again. That premise is grounded in realism. That’s what Tsuki ga Kirei tries to establish itself but falls short almost immediately due to the entire premise not making much sense from the very start. In my opinion, this story would have been told a lot better if it were in a high school setting.<br />
<br />
Another thing that is sort of not relatable in this show is the overemphasis on high school and how much of an important role high school takes in one’s life. I will have to agree to disagree. High school is definitely a shifting point of your life, you become more mature and more prepared for the real life so to speak. What I can’t understand is how they set high school as this unachievable goal which you have to strive and give everything up to make it. When in middle school it’s important to make the right decisions, the decisions you make, make you who you are. This show tries to be grounded in realism but simply can’t due to the set premise. <br />
<br />
The best way to describe the story of the show is to divide it into two parts. The first part of the show establishes the characters and builds up relationships between said characters. It is where Kotarou decides he likes Akane and wants to date her. Akane likes Kotarou. They eventually end up together but have difficulties communicating with each other. Their shyness problem creates a lot of issues and ends up burning bridges between certain characters. Many of the mishaps could have been avoided by simply telling your close friends what’s on your mind. It is not that difficult and you don’t end up in a weird situation with your close friends, they are your friends after all. Communication is key in many situations but two socially inept people do not seem to understand that.<br />
 <br />
Most of the conflicts essentially boil down miscommunication and misunderstandings. There isn’t anything advanced and this goes on for the first half of the show which is quite disappointing because there was much more potential in the show.<br />
<br />
The second part of the show is where Kotarou and Akane finally start dating and getting closer to each other. Many quintessential parts of their relationship are skipped. In one episode they can’t even talk to each other and in the next it feels like they’ve been dating for more than ten years. This sort of inconsistency and no development feels lazy and could have been done a lot better.  <br />
Because this is an anime about middle-school romance, there will be drama. That was exactly what I was looking for in Tsuki ga Kirei but I understood that I was wrong. There was barely any drama in the show and when there was, it amounted to nothing. It honestly felt pointless to even have it in the show, because nothing was changed and no lesson was learnt. The characters are exactly as they were before the incident happened as they are after the incident. This doesn’t leave any room for character development or growth which is exactly what you’d want to see in a show about making decisions that have impact on one’s life. You want to see how characters constantly grow, develop and learn from their previous mistakes. <br />
<br />
This show lacks comedy which is a shame. There is absolutely no comedy, jokes or anything remotely humorous happening in 12 episodes. It is truly a shame because comedy could have made the viewer feel a bit more relieved and at least have a laugh. The over serious tone this anime sets doesn’t feel genuine, it feels forced and unnatural many times. <br />
The pacing is too slow and the show quickly becomes boring and unwatchable at times. I started skipping certain parts of episodes because of how slow the show was but managed to still fully understand the story. It’s because there is very little substance to the plot and most of things happening are very predictable.<br />
<br />
The production value of this show is another hot topic as I’d like to point out that the animation isn’t perfect. The usage of CG in this show is utterly horrendous and made want to drop the show on several occasions. They’ve used CG to populate certain scenes with people and make them feel more realistic, which is quite a shame to be honest. Not all places have to be crowded and with the given budget, they should have probably not wasted any time or effort on doing what they did. The animation is decent when there isn’t more than 2 or 3 people in the scene. The sprinting animation was splendid though and I have no complaints about that. I wouldn’t say it’s unwatchable due to the animation or anything like that, you just have to get used to the really weird art-style and budget of this show. I only got used to it after 3 or so episodes.<br />
<br />
The music wasn’t anything special. Nothing memorable. It was as generic as it could get. <br />
<br />
I didn’t really enjoy the show. It was lackluster, it was boring and it was honestly a waste of time. Watching 12 episodes of this felt like spending 10 years of my life in agonizing pain. I really do appreciate the message but ultimately it amounted to nothing. As everything else to be frank. Characters didn’t grow. The story wasn’t there. The animation was most of the times utterly horrendous due to the usage of CG. The art-style was an insult. It felt like they used the same template for Akane as they did for Kotarou. They look absolutely identical, except for the minor changes to the body parts and hairstyle. I feel like this show lacked proper execution and some clear direction. These two things are unfortunately difficult to achieve, especially when your show has a low budget. What could have been an interesting premise turned into complete and utter dog shit. <br />
<br />
To wrap it all up, if you have a lot of time on your hands and want to watch a show that ultimately amounts to nothing with a magical happy ending, watch Tsuki ga Kirei. This show isn’t for everybody. It isn’t completely terrible and isn’t amazing by any means. I’d say this show falls under the “watchable” category. Watchable as in, it is possible to watch but you wouldn’t feel satisfied. Similar stories in other titles have been told a lot better. You have to be a masochist to watch this show from start to end. <br />

    I wanted to love it but I ended up hating it. Where does one begin when they want to talk about something that fills them with a complete contradiction? The answer is I don&#039;t really know.<br />
<br />
So, as a means to start this review I&#039;ll get the informal non-explanatory part out of the way:<br />
I am extremely pissed off. Never have I been so god damn irritated at a show in almost its entirety.<br />
<br />
And, as someone who is a bit of a sucker for a good romance, why am I so aggrieved at something which many consider a masterpiece in the genre? The simplest answer I can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255709">
        give is that from my perspective, the strengths of this show also happen to be its downfall.<br />
<br />
First ask yourself the question - what is the main strength of this show? For those who haven&#039;t seen it and don&#039;t know the answer, it&#039;s realism. It makes an attempt at portraying an extremely real-life scenario: no fan service, no dumb scenes spoiled for comedic effect, no obvious archetypes. Just a bunch of awkward teenagers being awkward teenagers and struggling to deal with lovey-dovey feelings.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know about you but I would consider this a plus, and to be fair most of the cast are brilliantly done in this regard. My issue however lies with the two main characters of the show - Kotarou and Akane.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be frank: never do these two display any sort of chemistry and it never feels like they&#039;re in a relationship until it&#039;s far too late to matter. Both characters display elements of realism that make sense but let&#039;s be real here: Kotarou asks Akane out on a whim despite not knowing very much about her because he fancies her and she says yes because she clearly fancies him as well. But they spend the entire time being awkward - they don&#039;t tell anyone, they hardly speak in each other&#039;s physical presence and no one really realises because the way they act they might as well not even be in a relationship. If half the characters in the show can&#039;t tell, how am I supposed to believe that they&#039;re really together?<br />
<br />
I&#039;d probably describe it as realism gone too far. The reason most shows are not portrayed in complete realism is because if they were they would be boring - no one wants to watch the monotony of everyday people. This is essentially how I feel - the majority of their interactions together are dull and I struggle to root for their romance when it never feels like they belong together. I guess the 8.40 average rating at the time of writing is testament against this but it&#039;s a mostly true statement (about why shows aren&#039;t portrayed with ultra realism) and I&#039;m simply writing how I feel. There are certainly those who think otherwise.<br />
<br />
I mean you know, I want them to be awkward but romantically awkward. I want them to spend all their time together and actually acknowledge each other around other human beings, not blatantly ignore each other until they&#039;re completely alone. Just personal idealism I suppose, but nonetheless representative of why it annoyed me. I want romance from my romance, not awkward nonsense with forced tearjerker moments to try and make me feel like they&#039;re being romantic.<br />
<br />
It also meant that the tearjerkers towards the end didn&#039;t pack the punch they should&#039;ve done. I really, really wanted to get into them but I couldn&#039;t because of the aforementioned reasons. Sitting through it I felt as if I was wasting my time.<br />
<br />
All in all, I don&#039;t particularly feel like the show is bad. I&#039;ve given it a 5 after all not a 1. I just came out of it highly unsatisfied and wishing what could have been, thinking about how I would have loved those tearjerkers had I gotten into the characters.<br />
<br />
Fair play to everyone who enjoyed it though. Everyone has their own opinions after all and I don&#039;t want to take issue with them. Just because I didn&#039;t love it doesn&#039;t mean others won&#039;t. <br />
<br />
Try not to feel put off by anything I&#039;ve said - if you&#039;re interested, give it a go. At the end of the day, it stands about above a lot of the crap considered &quot;romance anime&quot;. I&#039;m just here to offer a slightly different perspective from the majority for anyone who might be interested. Feel free to disagree and/or discuss anything I&#039;ve written about with me.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a nice day.

    I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but i&#039;m gonna make an exception, for this anime really touched me.<br />
<br />
I originally thought about giving this anime an 8 but after finishing it i feel like it would be unfair. It&#039;s not an anime that has amazing episodes, actually they can even get a bit boring at some point (specially if you&#039;re not used to &quot;paused&quot; animes) but what makes this anime so good is the whole of it, it&#039;s actually quite realistic about how current teenagers have relationships(with the typical japanes touch, of course) and the art is good, even though sometimes the CGI was horrible, the music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251529">
        fits perfectly and most importantly the MC is not the typical pu**y, he&#039;s in fact normal not a badass nor a pu**y.<br />
<br />
This show is not for everyone but if you like to cry and feel feelings(xd) when you watch anime this is your show
