    I’ve had this mixed reaction with school throughout my life. There were times when professors I’ve faced just tries to get on your nerves to make life a living hell. Then, there were times where I come across the best teacher in the world where it’s worth every minute attending the course. Ansatsu Kyoushitu (Assassination Classroom) isn’t just about learning something from the teacher though. If you take a knife, gun, or whatever that can be considered a killing tool to school, you’d get expelled. But in this series, that takes on a rather different direction. And I have to say, it’s peculiarly interesting at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190647">
        heart.<br />
<br />
Based on the manga of the same name, the series is financially successful so why not an anime adaptation? This didn’t came as a surprise as a special episode titled ‘Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) Episode 0: Deai no Jikan’ already debuted prior to its television premiere. With a peculiar premise about a class of students trying to literally kill their teacher, you’ll probably ask yourself if this is a suitable series for you.  <br />
<br />
A primary introduction into the series will easily set your eyes feasted into the story. The premise of the series involves a classroom of ordinary students known as Kunugigaoka Middle School&#039;s Class 3-E. Every morning involves them greeting their not-so-ordinary teacher. Known by many as “Koro-sensei”, he has a big smiley face, a body full of tentacles, and the personality of an easygoing guy. A main objective involves the students actually trying to kill him because in about a year, he will blow up the Earth. Now hold on. You’re probably asking yourself ‘what’? It’s not as twisted as it sounds though because the series is actually quite lighthearted. When molding the term “assassination” into any title, you would expect bloodthirsty violence or gore shoved down our throats. However, this series takes a satirical stab at the genre and transform it into a rather amusing series action-packed comedy of every day school life. <br />
<br />
The main attraction that can draw any viewer into this series is the comedy. And this is because the series itself has a personality. It’s especially true for Koro-sensei as he teaches more than just academics in class. He teaches about everyday life lessons and even connects individually with characters on a personal level at times. At certain points of the story, you’ll find him quite likeable and even relatable by the topics he covers in class. And of course, his expressive face is always amusing and delightful to watch. In essence, the comedy is refreshing and takes assassination to a level that can be considered more of a parody. The theme of assassination is actually deconstructed on a multitude of levels when it comes to story execution. It also crafts a bit of slice of life as some episodes feels like an adventure that takes the students to places they’ve never been before.<br />
<br />
While the comedy aspect of the show can be appealing, a large part of the series involves the characters. There’s actually a double edged sword to this series when it comes to characters, although for the most part, it should be considered a positive. The plus side is that there is a very diverse category of students attending 3-E. Almost all the characters have a unique personality and their involvement in the story.  The downside is that not every character/student in the class gets a prominent spotlight. Being a 2 cour show (22 episodes) lacks the necessity to draw this out so the series does what’s best to get what’s needed on-screen. Nagisa Shiota is the main male protagonist although he has a rather androgynous appearance. The way the series operates includes him and other students trying to kill their teacher, Koro-sensei but fails to do so every time. So in other words, the students all gets chances in some shape or form throughout the story. What I find most appealing about this is how Koro-sensei is consciously aware of their motivations but also gives encouragements to these students for trying while teaching them life lessons. Most of the characters also build relationships that are meaningful despite some obvious differences with their personalities. This is especially true for Nagisa and Karma Akabane, a notoriously troublesome boy. And on an individual level, there’s also distinctive amount of characterization focused on specific characters. Yukiko, Rio, and Ritsu are just a few to name as the series expands on their roles as the story progresses. Even teachers such as Tadaomi Karasuma and Irina Jelavic has a fluid characterization with their involvement in the main story.<br />
<br />
For more or less, the story flows like a slice of life with direction pointing at various locations.  It expands beyond just the classroom as the students does go occasionally on field trips. And often times, their trips takes them to places that associates with different culture. It explores a realistic side that almost blurs between the lines of fiction and reality. Furthermore, there’s an interesting degree of life lesson morality with certain aspects of the show. It even discusses certain sensible topics at times that people like you and me may be aware of. Of course, we also can’t forget about the academics part. As a show taking place in school life environment, there’s all sorts of subjects explored such as Math, Science, Social Studies, and even Physical Education. It’s like living the old days at high school again.<br />
<br />
I will say this series is not for everyone though. As a show about deconstructing the assassination trope, the humor can be a hit or miss for some. Rather, there’s a diehard attempt to illustrate a colorful side of killing. Assassination itself is a sensible topic but when it takes place in the classroom, it can sometimes be controversial. Luckily, most of the show is lighthearted and doesn’t ever venture into shock value. However, as lighthearted as it can be, the comedy will sometimes feel blend and repetitive. Also do note that this adaptation is rearranged a bit so some chapters are omitted to make the overall story feel smoother. <br />
<br />
Adapted from Lerche, Ansatsu Kyoushitu’s artwork succeeds in capturing the fitting art style of the series. It feels like the comedic tone and lighthearted atmosphere the creators are trying to bring out. Furthermore, the character designs matches their persona in terms of adaptation. Perhaps the most prominent design features Koro-sensei. I will say that this peculiar creature never ceases to amuse me whether he is teaching in class, his facial expressive reactions, or when he attempts to dodge his death. There’s also a good stylized way to coordinate the action with assassination that involves tools and strategies. Guns, swords, knives, bombs…you name it. They are there in the show and used in some very creative ways. The series puts the fun into their usage as we see how clever they can be used. Oh and did I mention Irina? The students may call her bitch sensei all the time but she has the figure of a femme fatale.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the lesser well addressed feature of the show is the soundtrack. Make no mistake though, the show doesn’t neglect that. The catchy OP/ED songs has a goofy yet effective style to give viewers an insight on what they can expect. Character voice mannerism are fitting for their roles. Koro-sensei himself has a very laid-back personality along with a voice that equally matches his character. I give praise to Jun Fukuyama for stepping into the shoes of this creature as it’s never easy to voice someone that is so otherworldly. OST on most parts is familiar although not the thing that stands out the most. Overall, the style is still an eerie beauty though.<br />
<br />
I know what you’re thinking. It’s probably something along the lines of “this show seems way too crazy”. And to be honest, you’re not wrong. But as crazy as it seems, it’s a lot of fun with assassination, school life, and a cast of characters with how they spend their daily lives. Rather than adapting romance angles or diehard drama, we get this classic shounen comedy with a very stylish way of storytelling. Each episode offers something new thanks to its themes and performances of the characters. The comedy is fresh and doesn’t rely on cheap cardboard fan service to get to its point. I highly recommend giving this series a try regardless of how unorthodox the premise may seem to sound. There’s a chance it could surprise you. After all, isn’t life just full of surprises?<br />

    (This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
As I made my way through my early education, I always considered myself a pretty good student. I read my books, did my homework, and played nicely during recess. There was a big flaw that took a while for me to shake off, though: talking way too much. I would talk while the teachers were speaking, I would talk over my friends, and I would talk during assemblies when I wasn’t supposed to. No matter how many reprimands or punishments I got, I couldn’t seem to get it into my noggin that there are times when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192653">
        you get to speak your mind and times when you just have to shut up. I eventually learned this lesson – it took a little too long by my family’s account – but my teachers never gave up on me. They stuck through my incessant ramblings, allowing me to realize the error of my ways, making me into a better person because of their hard work. Assassination Classroom performs similarly, offering an anime that still has lessons to be learned.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Assassination Classroom follows the “End Class,” a group of students relegated to the bottom-of-the-barrel in their school system due to their poor grades, abysmal behavior, or any combination thereof. One day, a new “teacher” arrives, tasking the class with a seemingly simple objective: assassinate him before the time limit is reached or the Earth is doomed. Picking up knives and weapons instead of pens and utensils, the kids train themselves to eliminate this otherworldly creature.<br />
<br />
The premise is wacky, without a doubt. Having a bunch of junior high delinquents kill their artificially composed “sensei” is pretty imaginative, but simultaneously seems as if there isn’t much to work with. To an extent, this mentality isn’t too far off. Assassination Classroom leans heavily on repetition for much of the season. Specifically, the children invent an elaborate way to go about taking out their teacher that ultimately fails. This is pretty much expected given the format of the anime; killing the teacher off early doesn’t make any sense because the show would end. So no matter what the kids do, the audience already knows that the outcome will never succeed. It therefore falls on the actual events to make up for the constant lack of return on the investment already given.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the show falls short here as well. The comedy is pretty simplistic because, like the assassination attempts, it devolves into repetition quite quickly. For example, “Professor Bitch” never fails to get mad at her students, the kids always overreact to Koro-sensei despite being around him for so long, and their individual quirks aren’t pronounced enough to be used as laughing points. Besides the comedy, the show has the tendency to reiterate the same ideas ad nauseam. “The E-Class is super dumb” and “Koro-sensei is incredibly fast” comprise a lot of the dialogue, often said once or twice (each) per episode. These facts are understood and established rather early, but the anime makes sure to shove in these ideas at every turn. It’s ironic, because such a tactic makes it seem as if the show – which is all about “getting” to these kids – doesn’t trust its viewers enough to also “get” what it has to say. There also exists an apparent tonal issue that the anime chooses to embrace. Assassination Classroom is meant to be a fun show. The weird teacher, the dichotomy of teenagers wielding combat weapons, and interactions of the students are normally meant to be lighthearted. So when the show diverts from this formula and goes dark or dramatic, it doesn’t work. While it tries to present itself as such, it instead feels forced. This is wholly apparent when, for example, the anime goes right back to its comedic roots after experiencing a life-threatening trek through a guerilla-infested hotel.<br />
<br />
There are other problems the show maintains – unnecessary narration since it rehashes whatever has already been discussed, one-time villains, an unclear antagonist – but the anime does manage to stick with its own theme: becoming a better person. However, it’s a bit stronger than this, because the kids of the “End-Class” aren’t ordinary children. They’re the ones who need the most help, who require the greatest amount of guidance to get them back on the right track. Thus, the theme changes slightly to: anyone can become a better person. We witness this idea unfold nearly every episode. One student learns about how important it is to always take proper safety precautions, another comes to understand the value of free will, and another still realizes the benefits of friendships. They get better physically and mentally, sure, but it’s these small but hugely important life lessons that leave the biggest impact, and subsequently make them better people. The theme itself also comes naturally – a teacher essentially does just this, teaching his or her students the proper ways of life. So watching these worse-off children improve their persons isn’t only rewarding for them and the audience, but it’s completely normal, too.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
There isn’t too much to say about the art style for Assassination Classroom. Interestingly, it does employ this strange tactic when it comes to its foreground characters. They all seem to “pop,” mostly due to the black outlines they each hold as well as the varied colors the show uses. The backgrounds aren’t too involved, mostly consisting of the same locations – the classroom, the surrounding field, and the main complex are visited the most. While they aren’t impressive, they do at least capture the school feel needed to make the actual events remain relevant.<br />
<br />
The character designs are nice for a simple reason: they aren’t extremely unique. There are students like Nagisa who have the uncommon hair color, but for the most part, the characters look like regular junior high kids. Obviously, this isn’t true for people like Koro-sensei and Irina, but they’re designs also fit well with who they are as people. Koro-sensei’s never-ending smile, tentacles, and pattern-changing skin coincide perfectly with his craziness whereas Irina’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and large bust make her the sexy woman she is. The rest of the cast is a mix of the two – normalcy combined with uniqueness – that never feels out of place.<br />
<br />
Actual animation is roughly average in execution. Koro Sensei takes up a lot of it, with his Mach speed and other physically impossible movements, but the students as well are given opportunities to strut their stuff. In fact, the premise makes this an easy matter; the gun fighting, martial arts, and other ridiculous situations give the show more than enough chances to work with. While it’s never stunning to see, the animation at least keeps up throughout the entirety of the season.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
There are a lot of characters within Assassination Classroom, and for good reason. It’s an entire class of students, faculty members, and other people who don’t fit into those descriptions. Now, it’s nigh impossible for the show to give an adequate amount of screen-time or development for every single person, so many of them are as one-dimensional as they come. One girl is known for her chubbiness, one dude is sort of a pervert, one girl likes detective-oriented manga, etc. At the minimum, the anime, despite the cast size it boasts, does try to give everyone at least some time in the spotlight.<br />
<br />
This widespread dividing of resources, though, introduces another problem of its own: not enough focus. Many of the bigger names within the show don’t receive nearly enough attention as they should, diminishing who they are as characters. For starters, Gakuhou, the president of the academy, is painted as evil but still a formidable educator. Yet, outside of making a few snarls or spewing some condescending words, he doesn’t do much of anything in regards to the plot. Itona, the “brother” of Koro-sensei, follows suit. He appears twice throughout the series, but besides having such strong connections and similarities to the teacher, nothing else is learned about him. Even Nagisa, technically the main student and contender to take down their target, doesn’t see much in the way of development. He sort of floats along with everyone else, gaining a ton of experience by observing Koro-sensei and participating in the daily training regimens. That’s the extent of who he is. He doesn’t seem too troubled by the events surrounding him, there doesn’t appear to be anything extravagant about who he is, and he doesn’t really grow beyond his current state. The final confrontation actually regressed his character for a time; while brief, he forgot almost everything he had learned up to the last fight.<br />
<br />
The worst offender is, surprisingly, Koro-sensei. Maybe three times at best, the show provides the audience with a miniscule glimpse into the alien’s background, but nothing more. His origin remains unknown and his ultimate motivations are unclear. Furthermore, his complete infallibility prevents him from being affected by the kids he advises so much. It sounds counterintuitive, but a teacher learns just as much from his or her students as they do from their mentor, but Koro-sensei cannot personally develop because there’s apparently nothing left for him to learn. “Apparently” is used here because, again, there is no knowledge about Koro-sensei’s actual person, so while there may be some kind of problems or issues Koro-sensei has or needs to face, these aren’t explored.<br />
<br />
Looking at these paragraphs here, there doesn’t seem to be anyone worth mentioning, but there are a few. Irina is investigated nicely enough, as is Yukiko, but the best character of the anime is Karma. Karma is a difficult kid to work with. He’s abrasive towards authority, he refuses to try hard, and has trouble making friends with others because of his constant bullying. Early on, Koro-sensei does manage to connect with Karma, to get him to understand the worth he has as a person. He calms down and opens up a bit to others, working with instead of against them, but still going about his own business. Later, when he loses grade-wise, he comes to learn that challenging yourself, not complacency, allows you to excel beyond what you were normally capable of. The culmination of his character development is seen near the end when, presented with a tough opponent, he not only chooses to fight him for the sake of his friends but also takes it seriously, more so than he ever had in the past. He began down and out, without people to guide him, but through Koro-sensei’s words of wisdom and friends who accepted him as one of their own, he slowly but surely turned out for the better. Still a little mean, but better nonetheless.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening themes for the show, goofy dances aside, are crafted to be fun. The lyrics are mostly filled with references to their teacher, killing, and assassinations, but the beat and instruments are very lighthearted to go along with the comedic nature of the show itself. The repetition here also doesn’t work in its favor; instead of being catchy, it’s annoying. However the male and female vocalists sing in harmony – for both OPs – matching the show’s sense of togetherness that it portrays.<br />
<br />
There is only one ending theme for Assassination Classroom. It wasn’t switched out for another because it’s too fantastic to forego. Contrasting with the OPs, it’s slow and gentle both on the ears and the heart. The lyrics and the singing give it a sense of longing; “I was waiting for,” “Hello, shooting star again,” and the “ah, ah” provide that grateful feeling when something finally returns. The instruments don’t overpower the singer, the pausing in the middle is advantageous to the ED’s theme, and the single guitar lead in at the beginning invites the listener to hear even more. It’s a phenomenal piece, and is definitely the highlight of the entire series.<br />
<br />
The rest of the soundtrack actually has a wide range of beats and tracks to fit many separate and varying occasions. “Yukai na Anatsu Keikaku” is very upbeat with the jazzy brass, plethora of drums, and simple beat. “Haritsume ta Kuuki” is both ominous and mysterious, and eventually picks up to increase tension in a positive manner. “Tadashi” is quite ambient, almost techno in its presentation, and rather fitting for the “alien” scenario the students find themselves in. And “Niramiai” continues with the stealthy and covert-operation vibe that many of the events follow. It’s all appropriate and fits the overall moods of the anime nicely, but nothing is overtly astonishing or memorable.<br />
<br />
Voice acting for the show is somewhere around average. A special shout-out is deserved for Jun Fukuyama as Koro-sensei for his zany mannerisms and way of speaking.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
As I made my way through this one, I could not get over how kiddy it all was. No amount of guns, bodacious babes, or crazy bad guys could stop me from thinking that this one was designed for a way younger crowd than it was intended for. I never really laughed when I was supposed to, the bad guys were silly rather than scary, and the drama present didn’t move me like it should.<br />
<br />
There weren’t even any characters I really liked, save for two. Irina was there as eye-candy for me and Ritsu (who isn’t even “real”) was adorable after her upgrades. Besides these two girls, I found the rest of the known cast to be boring or lame. Koro-sensei, too, was not entertaining; he’s really fast and crazy, I get that. But his love of big boobs and constant chuckling was never fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Assassination Classroom has an amazing ending theme, but the praise halts there. The narrative holds way too many problems to be purposeful, the characters lack the focus necessary to make them meaningful, and the show is way too childish for its own good. Hopefully this one goes to cram school before its second season, because all its doing right now is failing.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Bad, constant lack of return, too much pointless repetition, tonal issues, but learning life lessons is both rewarding and natural<br />
<br />
Animation: Fine, okay art style, nice character designs, average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Bad, many students are glanced at, important members like Gakuhou, Nagisa, and especially Koro-sensei aren’t explored enough, but some like Irina, Yukiko, and Karma are<br />
<br />
Sound: Fine, okay first OP, okay second OP, great ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Bad, too kiddy, not funny, Koro-sensei is not entertaining, and only Irina and Ritsu out of the entire cast were tolerable<br />
<br />
Final Score: 3/10

    Ah, school.  The inescapable part of our lives where we spend minimum 12 years of our lives learning a wide array of subjects, facts, and topics that we most likely will never use the majority of in our professional lives.  So, with another school anime, what kind of anime would we get from something about a bunch of middle school students?  Well...how about one where the middle school students try and kill their teacher?<br />
<br />
Story (8.08/10): E class, also known as the end class in the prep school of Kunugigaoka Junior high is a place fabled in the school to be the worst

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190673">
        class, housing the worst students in the school, grade-wise.  Here, the students of this fabled &quot;failure&quot; are tasked with a rather...unique task, killing this yellow octopus-like...thing who according to him, has turned the moon into a permanent crescent and this coming March, will blow up the earth as well.  Oh boy...that&#039;s a situation to be in.<br />
<br />
Assassination classroom, or AssClass as a shorthanded was of calling the show, follows the story of the end class as they try and kill their teacher during their first semester in 9th grade.  With every few episodes or so, one or more people in the classroom attempt to assassinate their teacher known as Koro-sensei (literally unkillable teacher in translation), usually ending in failure because this teacher can fly at Mach 20, is resistant towards conventional weapons, and only a particular set of weaknesses that you learn over time.  (Basically the story of &quot;teacher too OP, GG, plz nerf)<br />
<br />
While the show focuses pretty heavily on the aspect of killing an alien creature so to say, a lot of the show as well talks about the idea of teaching and comparing that to the idea of assassination.  Because the show is centered around these academically challenged students, the show also emphasizes on their growth as students and a person&#039;s learning potential, which actually puts in some pretty good themes.  But don&#039;t worry, this show is plenty about trying to kill an octopus, so you don&#039;t have to worry about the actually school learning taking over the story.<br />
<br />
Comedy as well is well done for AssClass as well.  Much of it is done in this style where you get immediate comebacks from various characters as well as that brief, awkward moment to take in what just happened, which I think makes the show relatively fresh me never boring to watch.  Mostly, I think it&#039;s in part of Lerche doing the production of this show, but the manga itself is still pretty damn funny, which brings me to my next point.<br />
<br />
In terms of differences to the manga, AssClass the anime focuses its runtime on the events that for the most part, don&#039;t focus on one character.  There&#039;re a lot of chapters within AssClass that are devoted solely on one student, chapters that give more life to class E.  On account of time constraints, not all of the students that were focused on those chapters are focused in the anime, which is a slight bother that I will bring up later.<br />
<br />
Overall though, this adaptation was no bad in the slightest.  The manga was perfectly encapsulated in this anime and I found myself to be laughing just as much as I did when I read it.  As usual with comedy anime, depending on your taste in comedy, this show may or may not suit your liking.<br />
<br />
Overview<br />
+ Original story<br />
+ Has some nice themes about learning (using assassination)<br />
+ Good comedy (this can be bad depending on your taste in comedy)<br />
-  Not all students got a featured episode<br />
<br />
Characters (8.33/10): Whenever you&#039;re making any comedy anime, the most important part of making memorable comedy is to have memorable characters that you can remember the personalities of to deliver those sweet, sweet jokes that make comedy so good.  Luckily, AssClass succeeds in doing this.<br />
<br />
Up first, is our main protagonist of the story, the hero among heroes, the one who will bust our funny bones, Koro-sensei.  You thought it was one of the E class kids?!  No, it&#039;s the thing that wants to destroy the earth that&#039;s the real hero here.  (Ok, that was a bit contradictory). As I have stated before, Koro-sensei is for the most part, the pathway for the show&#039;s comedy. Being a bit of a silly creature that sometimes makes absolutely no sense, Koro-sensei is the most memorable character of this show not only because the show revolves around trying to kill him but because you won&#039;t forget him.  Like seriously, it&#039;s going to be very hard to forget a yellow, pervy octopus that flies around at Mach 20 speed going Nufufufufu everywhere with a big toothy grin.<br />
<br />
And then we have class E.  I grouped these characters up together for a few reasons.  One, there&#039;re 30+ of them.  I&#039;m not making 30 paragraphs to talk about them, it&#039;s too much work.  Two, it&#039;s easier to talk about these characters&#039; purpose.  Throughout the show, you do get to know more about class E.  Their names, personalities, and for a couple, how they got put into the end class.  A lot of these characters, namely Nagisa, Kayano, Karma, and a few others are talked about a lot and for the audience, are more well known.  Inversely though, many of the class E characters don&#039;t get as well as an introduction as others do.  As a result, many are otherwise unknown or mentioned for a brief second.  Because there&#039;re 30+ students, it becomes a challenge to really know the individual characters very well mostly because for the most part, the show treats them all as one unit.  <br />
<br />
As for side characters, the most noticeable ones are the other teachers of the E class, Karasuma and Irina, or, as everyone loves to call her, &quot;bitch-sensei&quot;.  (If I was lying, these parentheses would be saying something else.). As far as side characters go, these two are the most used and most recognizable, being blessed with roles that have them appear much more often than a standard side character, which makes them better characters overall.  The other side characters for this show serve similar purposes in the memorable department, but mostly only serve to be an obstacle for our class E to overcome.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Best teacher. (Nufufufufufu =w=)<br />
+ Great side cast<br />
+ Memorable characters<br />
- Class E was treated as a whole unit rather than 30 some odd characters<br />
<br />
Art and sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10) the art for AssClass was a very brightly done style using a very light gradient that made everything sort of pop.  As well as doing some standard comedic faces for characters and good animation fluidity, the art was rather stable and standard fare.  But...what really stood out for the art for me was being able to pull off the more dark and menacing scenes in the same style.  It gave a sense of eerie feeling when things went dark for a second which I thought was a nice design flourish.  <br />
<br />
Also, Lerche managed to squeeze in the symbolism for various characters from the manga into the anime itself, so good on you.  <br />
<br />
In terms of sound, I didn&#039;t really find the soundtrack to be all that memorable.  I would describe it as fun more than anything else, not really a masterpiece.  As a show with 2 OP tracks that had a similar feel to both of them, I wouldn&#039;t say I didn&#039;t enjoy them, but I didn&#039;t think they&#039;d were completely stellar by any stretch of the imagination.  Ed song was tranquil but didn&#039;t stick in my head.  Though I will give props for that creepy track whenever a realization happens.  That was a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Overview<br />
+ Bright art<br />
+ Menacing scenes looked great in the artstyle<br />
+ Decent soundtrack<br />
-  Soundtrack to me wasn&#039;t memorable<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (9.09/10):  While I did have some issues with various parts of the show, I&#039;ll be honest, it didn&#039;t matter, cause this was a fun watch.  I was skeptical of the AssClass series when this started airing, but after checking out the manga (and marathon read that for 6 weeks), I can&#039;t say I wasn&#039;t pleased to read/watch this series.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
Yes.  I think this anime was a great adaptation of the AssClass manga.  There were no shortcuts aside from the student chapters, and everything was told just how it was without any unnecessary changes.  It was great to see some of my favorite scenes in animated form.  <br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?  <br />
<br />
While the manga itself didn&#039;t make note of all the kids by the period of time where the anime ends, there were still some kids that had hi lighted chapters for them, which inversely, wasn&#039;t transported to the anime.  It made the students more individual and it felt unfair to see only some not all got animated, because some character jokes and gags don&#039;t really make much sense unless you actually know the whole character.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?  <br />
<br />
In terms of comedy, I would say it is  one of the better ones to come out in recent times.  It has a fun, 22 episode runtime, there&#039;re great and memorable characters in there, and there is a method behind the madness.  The only major issue I have is that the jokes pertaining to a certain character don&#039;t always get translated well, so some things might be hit or miss.  But apart from that little bug, I give this show. Solid...B+, for effort<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 8.05/10

    If I were to tell you that an anime called &quot;AssClass&quot; was about a tentacle monster that shows up to a middle school and... stopped right there- you&#039;d think that this was some nasty hentai, right?<br />
<br />
Well, let me be the first to say that this show surprised me in several ways. <br />
No, it doesn&#039;t have surprise sex scenes.<br />
<br />
Assassination Classroom, where a group of misfit students band together to try and take down their anthropomorphic, superpowered octopus teacher. The only problem is that while he can break all the rules of physics, they can&#039;t. How do you kill a monster who threatens to destroy the Earth,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190667">
        and backs his promise up by obliterating the moon, Death Star style? <br />
<br />
<br />
Artwork and Animation: 7<br />
<br />
AssClass, as a comedy, has a fairly typical &#039;cutesy&#039; exaggerated feel to the artwork. Everything is a little larger than life, and some characters are little more than animated caricatures, but it goes along well with the overall tone of the series. It&#039;s not made to look hyper-realistic, and it plays around a lot with sight gags and some fun oversaturated/negative color asides in the vein of Jojo. <br />
It&#039;s a very colorful and vibrant looking show, with some exotic locales and a seeming obsession with using every crayon in the box to make it look lush. For a new studio like Lerche, I&#039;ll give them the thumbs up. It never got sloppy or lazily drawn (Looking at you, Pierrot.) and stayed consistent from start to finish. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound and Voice Acting: 7<br />
<br />
There are 26 recurring named and individually voiced students, so prepare for an onslaught of names to remember. Some standouts are: Koro Sensei himself, with Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch, Code Geass) behind the mic, Aya Suzuki (Mako, KLK) as Kaede, and Shizuka Itou (Akeno, HSDxD) lending her sexiness to Irina Jelavich.<br />
<br />
Despite the immense amount of voices that are used in the show, they don&#039;t all end up in the blender and come out a gray, Japanese sounding paste. I won&#039;t say each character is unique, because they&#039;re not, but there were several memorable voices in this that set themselves apart from the rest of the class- Koro Sensei leading the pack. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters and Story: 7<br />
<br />
With 26 different students, an ever growing staff of teachers, a mystery monster, evil principals, some arc-based antagonists, and a cheerfully murderous AI contained in a TV,  somehow they manage to wrap all of them up into a single plot and keep the characters relevant. While some of the students get their time in the sun, a group of kids stay at the forefront- and they&#039;re who I&#039;ll focus on.<br />
<br />
Nagisa, the ambiguously gendered main character, Karma the &#039;bad boy&#039;, Terasaka the ruffian, and Kaede the green haired voice of reason round out the most prominent characters. (Man, this sounds like a boy band, hope that Backstreet Boys pun before isn&#039;t lost on anyone)<br />
<br />
Nagisa is a little blue haired runt who gets picked on a lot, but turns out to be the one with the most potential to whack Koro Sensei due to his ability to think outside the box and react quickly. His growth over the course of the show is rather symbolic of the class as a whole. Unrefined, rejected, and isolated, Nagisa and the other students begin as yet another take on the &quot;ragtag group who grow together to do something awesome&quot; trope, but pass the test for being something a little more. <br />
<br />
Supporting them are the teachers; the aforementioned anthropomorphic, mach 20 flying, super genius octopus Koro Sensei, the straight man, government agent, and PE teacher Karasuma, and the beautiful seductress assassin, Bitch-sensei! <br />
<br />
While this disparate group sounds like a really cheesy setup for an ensemble comedy, AssClass manages to sidestep the garbage ecchi humor (some lampshaded or shut down gags from Irina aside), overplayed wannabe 4th wall humor, and moé stuff in favor of a generally amusing and overall decent plot, complete with a couple of twists and likable characters. The dynamic between Karasuma and Irina, and watching the group of misfit kids bond together over trying futilely to destroy their teacher while at the same time receiving the best instruction and support of their lives was fun. <br />
<br />
While a lot of questions about Koro Sensei go unanswered, and some character&#039;s backstories not explored fully- they don&#039;t necessarily take away from the show. I never felt like I had to know everything about Koro Sensei to be able to enjoy the struggle going on. It&#039;s apparent within the universe of the show that several people know what his story is, so I&#039;m content to wait until it&#039;s explained to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
Often with these ensemble shows, I end up hating the characters and want them to die brutal, painful deaths- and with a name like Assassination Classroom, one would think that it&#039;s a violent murderfest- but that couldn&#039;t be farther from the truth. <br />
<br />
AssClass was definitely a fun watch every Friday, and every episode felt like it had something to offer, even after the novelty of &quot;Will they get him this time??&quot; wore off. How all the formative events from the beginning and middle of the show came together at the end was nice to see, and the show never broke its internal logic- but it does have some Anime Biology ™ going on. Who cares though? It has an octopus that can destroy the moon and fly 15,224 miles per hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
I&#039;m happy to hand Lerche and AssClass a 7, and looking forward to what they bring with Gakkou Gurashi next season. <br />
<br />
<br />
Recommend?<br />

Yes- if a light hearted action/comedy about middle school kids trying to kill their teacher while learning life&#039;s lessons sounds like fun, you&#039;d be right. It is. <br />

    Naivety...children are overflown with it. However, naivety is a word with its meaning brought forth from grownups. What if naivety holds a nobility grownups can no longer understand, what if what you sometime used to know was all you actually had to...yes, E-gumi not fully experiencing the harshness of life could be called naive, them naive or those who called them  naive, incapable.  <br />
<br />
Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is not anime which aims to cultivate one&#039;s inner world or lay forth philosophical notions for one to ponder over, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is a fun, comical and extremely enjoyable anime with that bright side of naivety being the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193719">
        only worthy moral to reap from it.<br />
<br />
I got surprised by how unique and at the same time trite the story was, only to realize afterwards that originality in the story, characters or plot is not where the anime wants to focus, but the manner it will<br />
present them...<br />
We have our usual Japanese high school, and a class of misfits handled by an unusual teacher. Much like<br />
Great Teacher Onizuka, or at least sharing the same core. Koro sensei...he is  yellow, of unidentified species and flawless from more or less every aspect, but most of all, he is E-class&#039; assassination target.<br />
Ansatsu Kyoushitsu doesn&#039;t have a strong story, and even though the adventure part is serious, the anime as a whole has more of a comical appeal. It won&#039;t be long before the word assassination loses the awe it initially provoked, and at the very least by episode five you will realize that the only thing you won&#039;t fully know or expect from the anime-as it doesn&#039;t have much unexpected or hidden things-is the reason why Koro sensei involved himself with E-gumi. So, basically, you will have lots of fun as the class trains and at the same time attempts to assassinate its resourceful teacher, bonding stronger in every attempt. And fun is all you will get, in case you want complexity, originality-even though Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is like no other anime I&#039;ve watched-suspense, hardcore adventure and seriousness, Ansatsu will fail you.<br />
Although, it has its incredibly vivid art to make up for it,its cheerful and rhythmic openings, the amazing ending most people who like Japanese music will end up downloading, and lastly, a limited few of notable <br />
and distinguishable characters. In fact, the range of characters is not exactly wide, and aside the two main and a few supporting, it is highly unlikely that you will remember the names of the rest. <br />
The anime progresses smoothly and pleasantly, only getting dark and heavy at a part or two with minor duration. All in all, it is rare for an anime with assassination as its theme to not be influencing negatively, but lifting your mood instead. Ansatsu will not leave a vivid impact on you, however the memory of watching it will be a happy one as it is from the anime that make you smile while watching.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion, is that Ansatsu does not have much room for development, all the more, it should be short and worthwhile. The second season though, will be a thing to look forward to as the one thing it has to reveal has not been revealed yet.<br />

    Usually I do not bother myself with writing negative review (this is actually a common MAL trend as reviews are usually written by fans) as  I have more or less good understanding of why tv in question are so popular despite being bad in my eyes. But this one is a total mystery for me. <br />
<br />
It is pretty easy to split this tv  in 3 independent &quot;themes&quot; and analyze them separately:<br />
<br />
1. Class needs to kill their teacher in order to save the world. <br />
<br />
Sounds fun huh? But it was not.<br />
I expected a lot of cunning assassination schemes, clever traps, constant progress in methods

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198651">
        but alas - nothing of it. After few mediocre direct attempts to kill no one in class cares about it anymore,  and story is shifted towards normal school live show + occasional pro-killer come to do the same dumb direct attempts to kill which is never gonna work by setting design (and therefore boring to watch). The lack of creativity is astonishing, I can&#039;t believe it was possible to do such a boring write-up with such potentially-reach material on hands.<br />
Definitely a weakest part of the show. If you were primary  interesting in this part - skip this show. <br />
<br />
Score: 2/10<br />
<br />
2. Class E is a class of problem children. School system is a bit evil. Classical story about making misfits into nice persons via solving their problems.<br />
<br />
The show is struggle to find a right  balance between assassinations and telling sad stories of the students. Both parts feels like incomplete attempts. But at least this part is done in more or less standard fashion. The bad part of it is the teacher character - he is very one-dimensional. He doesn&#039;t feel like a real person with any depth, and the main reason for it is a comedic relief. They wanted a comedy show similar to GTO, I assume. But while Onizuka provided plenty of fun while being a solid character which you can relate to, our teaches is just a clown with nothing to back him up. To make it worse variety of jokes are very limited and after 3-4 series you watched them all and they were not fun to begin with. This is huge letdown as show relies on it very heavily.<br />
<br />
Score: If if take GTO as 10 than this show would be around 4/10.<br />
<br />
3. Main plot aka who is Mr Teacher, why he needs to destroy earth, who is behind all of this  etc.<br />
Probably the best part of the show, unfortunately show is dragged into second season therefore there are no answers and overall amount of plot content is abysmal. The best way to describe this series would be - filler, slow paced, repetitive, quite boring and a bit absurdic. It really feels like you watch worst part of a good show.<br />
<br />
Score: N/A, all in second season.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: While I expect second season to be much better, I still believe it is not worth to struggle trough 22 episodes of filler material.<br />
With 12  episodes format it would be so-so, but 22 puts it beyond salvation. And as  it was released alongside with pretty solid tiles - I see no reason to pay any attention to it.

    I began to watch this anime thinking it would be both entertaining and interesting. It&#039;s not that I expected that much of this anime, but I have never been this disappointed in my life. Every episode I prayed to God that the agony would finally stop, but it didn&#039;t. I guess God gives and God takes. And he took the pleasure of living by presenting this shitty anime.<br />
The first five minutes were quite interesting, as the plot was still in development. Some tentacle guy blew up the moon and threatens to blow op the earth unless he gets to teach some drop-out high school kids

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190875">
        to and train them to kill him. As I&#039;m typing this I begin to wonder why I didn&#039;t stop watching after the first five minutes. This was the whole plot btw. In the other 21 episodes nothing happens. At all. Not even fanservice. <br />
<br />
- Spoilers: - The ending was entire shit. It turned out he turns invincible for a day if he wants to. Also the deadly poison of which everyone would die wasn&#039;t actually poison. <br />
But the most excruciating part of the plot, the part where I actually had to pause the last episode and think for a second about what the writers were thinking, was the part where our trans-gendered main character Nagisa actually tries to kill a man. This was unbelievable, I&#039;ve finally watched to the point in an assassination anime where someone gets killed, and the whole class and teacher say &#039;No don&#039;t do it Nagisa killing is wrong!&#039;. Can you believe this shit? I can&#039;t even start explaining why I raged so hard.<br />
Now, if there is no plot, can the characters save this anime? The answer: No. The only decent character is the 2D waifu tactical warfare robot machine from Norway, everyone else has a generic background of failing their school exams for arbitrary reasons. Also, even though they failed every exams ever, everyone in the class is actually a genius with IQ&#039;s over 130 and ace every test if they feel like it.<br />
However, there may be a target audience for this anime. If you&#039;re a teacher, there may be some useful tips &#039;hidden&#039; in every episode. If you pay attention, more than half of every episode contains a long and in-depth preach about the secret techniques of teaching and the inner workings of children&#039;s minds.<br />
The art and sound were ok I guess. Nothing special, nothing as shit as the rest of the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, I was very disappointed and I feel like I wasted a part of my life watching this abomination.<br />
Even writing a review about it made me cry inside, but I wanted to warn everyone else out there expecting something great because of everyone rating it 9/10<br />
<br />
But the question remains... is Nagisa really a guy? No one knows

    Assassination Classroom is one the only anime that can have tentacles near middle school girls without being a hentai. It&#039;s like, this is the new challenge of the year. First this, now Splatoon. <br />
Anyway, AssClass is a 22 episode anime about a mach 20 speed octopus who threatens to destroy Earth by the end of the school year. He&#039;s now a teacher in middle school, and his class has to assassinate him before he destroys Earth. <br />
And people thought Pupa had a weird plot. Let&#039;s jump right into it.<br />
#jumpyreviews<br />
<br />
After finishing AssClass, I had very mixed feelings about it. It&#039;s not bad, but it really isn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191233">
        a great anime. I think the crazy plot AssClass has can turn off a lot of viewers, but it all depends on how they execute it. The story is divided in many arcs, where the 26 students and a fucking robot, will try to kill the teacher. The problem with this is that it&#039;s fucking predictable when it focuses on killing the teacher. When, basically, the tentacle monster is leading the show with a few other students and is also over-powered, you don&#039;t think they&#039;ll kill him off easily, huh? Considering that the show was announced to have a second season and the manga is currently still ongoing, you pretty much know what&#039;s gonna happen every time that they get really close to killing the tentacle monster, Koro Sensei, so you really end up not caring. I mean, right from the start, you can tell that they aren&#039;t gonna kill Koro Sensei at any time soon; you already know exactly what&#039;s gonna happen and it&#039;s gonna frustrate you every time they get close to killing him. How do you solve this? Making your arcs interesting and not focusing on only killing Koro Sensei, which AssClass does quite well.<br />
<br />
AssClass does drift apart from the actual plot, to introducing other villains and many characters. Even though, some of them aren&#039;t really as good as the rest, it was the best way to go before it got predictable as it was in the beginning. So yes, the show does pick up after a few episodes. I found the beginning to be a rough start, but it got better along the way. Even though the plot isn&#039;t really all that good, it does its best at not completely going to shit. <br />
<br />
The characters are rather hard to talk about because there are so many. I won&#039;t be covering every single character. <br />
Koro Sensei is pretty much the most entertaining character in the series. There are many questions about his character that still go unanswered, that will hopefully be answered in season 2, as I&#039;ve heard from a lot of manga readers. His character isn&#039;t really what you would call &quot;great&quot;, but it&#039;s definitely the one that keeps it interesting. <br />
<br />
Nagisa is the biggest trap there is. He&#039;s probably the smartest out of all the students, and let me remind that there&#039;s a fucking robot as one of the students. He&#039;s smart, energetic and thinks out of the box in order to kill Koro Sensei. <br />
His character is the one that had the most potential to be great and have a great development, and don&#039;t get me wrong, it wasn&#039;t bad, but it could&#039;ve been way better. By the end of the series, I didn&#039;t felt like he grew much. We don&#039;t even know much about him, he&#039;s just a badass with potential, and hopefully he will improve in season 2. <br />
<br />
The other characters aren&#039;t really worth mentioning. No, they&#039;re not bad, they&#039;re just there. I&#039;ll give credit to the plot for actually being a bit original. Yes, it might sound like a bit of a stretch at first, but it all it fits pretty well, even with its few plot holes. The characters aren&#039;t really original, they all follow feel like other characters I&#039;ve seen many times, and makes them feel very one-dimensional. They do try to develop some of the characters, but the only ones I can give credit for actually doing something with them are Nagisa and Karma, which is a red hair psychopath that had a great introduction, but was barely shown ever again. He does have a different point of view by the end of the show, but boy, was it predictable. I couldn&#039;t find myself caring about any of the characters, which is a bit bad for a show that has many characters. You don&#039;t have to develop all of them, but at least try to make me care for, I dunno, more than one. I&#039;m just hoping that they flesh out some of the characters in the next season, because this one didn&#039;t do it for me.<br />
<br />
The animation is pretty solid and I was pretty impressed with a lot of the show had to offer with some scenes. The backgrounds sometimes looked terrible and sometimes they looked pretty decent. Nothing was outstanding, but nothing was bad, other than some of the backgrounds, especially when it takes places out doors. I should mention that this was animated by Lerche, which is pretty new to the community. The next thing that they&#039;ll be animating will be Gakkou Gurashi this Summer, which I&#039;m actually pretty excited to watch. Hopefully they won&#039;t fuck up. <br />
<br />
The character designs weren&#039;t too bad, but followed the hair color thing to keep you from getting confused on which character is which. Remember guys, if you can&#039;t remember the name, just call them by the color of the hair.<br />
 The outlines of the characters were quite a bit annoying and reminded me of the outlines in Attack on Titan, which annoyed me, as well. Nothing really impressed me, but it didn&#039;t left a bad taste in my mouth. <br />
<br />
The cinematography was rather average, but it did impressed me with some of the action scenes. This being a shounen, I wasn&#039;t expecting it to take such a different tone in camera angels. It was a bit refreshing, but other than the fight scenes, it was pretty average. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack fits rather well in the show. The songs played in the perfect time to set up a tone in the show. When it wanted to be serious, it had serious music, when it wanted to be goofy, it had goofy music, and so on. The opening is a bit awkward and can get stuck in your head. The second opening is more of the same, but the 2nd Ending song was actually quite impressive and I never found myself really skipping it. The 1st Ending song is just average.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you feel like watching a pretty entertaining anime about killing a tentacle monster involved with no hentai (kinda), then by all means, go watch AssClass. If it doesn&#039;t seem to interest you, I suggest you at least give it a try, because you might end up liking it more than me. It has its good and it has its bad. If I had to score AssClass, I would give it a 5.5/10 or a 6/10.<br />
<br />
I recommend you at least give the first episode a try and I&#039;m hoping that Lerche can handle Gakkou Gurashi rather well. Hopefully Lerche will also step their game up with AssClass in the second season, as well. <br />
<br />

    “Assassination is education. The sensei of the Assassination Classroom becomes stronger as he teaches.” – Koro-sensei <br />
<br />
In Assassination Classroom (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu), education is assassination, and assassination is education, to learn is to assassinate, and to assassinate is to learn.<br />
<br />
Class 3-E is not an ordinary clichéd school classroom, instead of pencils and calculators, we get knives and guns. Yes, Assassination Classroom is not your ordinary school comedy anime. It diverges and expands through the norms, and it transforms into something of utmost originality and uniqueness.<br />
<br />
(Disclaimer: this is going to be quite a long review, so hopefully you can bare with it!?)<br />
<br />
The setting of the show revolves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190640">
        around Class 3-E, a group of students of a prestigious school named Kunugigaoka Junior High School, and is perceived as inferior, being the lowest class of the institution. However, at the same time, Class E is also the location of the government’s confidential assassination scheme on Koro-sensei, the monstrous looking octopus-like being who has threatened to destroy Earth after teaching Class 3-E for a year. Being able to move at a speed of Mach 20, Koro-sensei is almost able to do anything at will, travel anywhere and even teach his students effectively individually with his speed. His advanced capabilities and powers make assassination a difficult challenge for the students, and ultimately show the indomitability of the human spirit, the resilience of the class, and their increasingly strengthening determination of the students to strive for success after experiencing defeat and failure. <br />
<br />
Assassination Classroom has one of the most unique and original stories out there amongst the anime and manga industry, and is able to utilise its main theme of assassination and education to its utmost benefit, to achieve development and characterisation within its particularly large cast, and to manifest as well, many other notable themes such as the value of friendship, class and discrimination, failure and defeat, and human perseverance. <br />
Most of the episodes in Assassination Classroom contain many underlying didactic and moral powerful life lessons, and these are not only in the form of motivation, but also inspiration. With Koro-sensei helping the students out in both their actual education, and in their assassination attempts, the students are able to learn many values and life-changing lessons from their “teacher” and “target” whilst conducting the assassination attempts as well, and as this exchange benefits both parties, the relationship between both the teacher/target and the students/assassins are able to strengthen and develop. Many of the students have their own problems, be it their personality, or their background and upbringing, through assassination and education, Koro-sensei is able to aid these students individually as well, to seek out their troubles, and to bring good into them and show them the beauty of their lives and the bonds they encompass. <br />
<br />
Without a doubt, with assassination as the central theme of the show, it is this that allows immense room for the characters to learn and understand more about each other, about Koro-sensei, and ultimately, permits characters to grow both individually and together collectively. Not only do the students learn from Koro-sensei, but at the same time, Koro-sensei is also able to learn from the students, forging trust and bonds between the two in Class 3-E. <br />
<br />
The show however takes a very risky step regarding its diverse and large cast with more than 20 students, and 3 teachers. With limited screen time, it is inevitable that not only some characters are unrecognizable, but also some of the characters will lack the necessary screen time to properly convey their backstories and personalities and may thus be deemed as “less important” or trivial. Despite this noticeable flaw with the enormous cast, it is not only each individual that compose the cast, but instead it is all of the characters collectively that the characters are able to grow as a class. Unless specific students are the central focus of an episode and in the assassination attempt, they are left forgettable and are overshadowed by the more noticeable and outstanding characters such as Nagisa and Karma. <br />
<br />
Shiota Nagisa is the central protagonist amongst Class-E and is often a calm and friendly person. Perhaps, it is also necessary to point out that Nagisa is the best trap. He occasionally takes on the role of an observer and narrator and is cautious in every situation. He is also very meticulous and diligent to exploring every detail of Koro-sensei’s himself in order to aid future assassination attempts. Although calm on the outside, some scenes showcase Nagisa’s inner-assassin potential and it is his calmness that makes him unique as an assassin as he is shown having the innate ability to hide his bloodlust.<br />
<br />
Akabane Karma is another prominent student within Class-E and is not only one of the most intelligent, cunning and witty in the class, but also one of the smartest in the entire school. Although he has a rather sadistic personality and likes to torture his opponents, Karma has a positive mindset, and also has good morals behind his intentions. He is known for being a delinquent and troublesome violator in the school, and has lost respect for adults after being betrayed by his most trusted homeroom teacher prior arriving Class 3E. However, it is because of his inner-caring personality and moral mindset that he was placed in Class E as he rescued a senior from being bullied by students of the main building. Even though he may seem to be extremely smart and a genius in assassination, he has a tendency to be overconfident, arrogant and lazy at times, hindering his ability to develop further. However, Koro-sensei realises this and after Karma received a “defeat” in their confrontation with Class A, and fell in the academic rankings, Koro-sensei made it clear to Karma that he needs to abandon his overconfident self, and accept improvement because defeat ultimately incites growth, unlocking Karma’s potential as both a student and an assassin. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s these simple didactic and inspiring lessons that allows us watchers to also feel sympathy for the characters and at the same time, allows us to comprehend the true meaning of defeat, perseverance and the relationships the characters share together. Although reality may be harsh and dejected, one must always work his way through and persevere in order to achieve improvement– that is the glory and advantage of mankind.<br />
<br />
Although only glimpses of Koro-sensei’s past have been shown in the anime, it is this enigma of his character that allows suspense to fill the watchers’ minds, and keep watching further to truly understand Koro-sensei’s underlying motives behind “destroying” the world after a year of teaching. Koro-sensei is extremely humble, talented, and funnily enough, quite perverted. He cares for his students, not only about their education, but also their skills in the field of assassination as well as their own personal individual lives. It’s truly teachers like these that these students are able to grow so fast and so much both academically and as an assassin, and have a widened outlook on their lives. Although Class E may be ostracized from the main school and the higher-up classes, there is no discrimination in Class E itself after all, the class itself is almost like a family, with close bonds interconnected through each other being peers of another in a group of assassins. Even as the students love Koro-sensei and understand that he genuinely cares for them, they know that they have to still carry out their assassination because that is the initial reason of Koro-sensei joining the class, and also, the planet is being threatened to being destroyed.<br />
<br />
Karasuma, is another one of Class E’s teachers, a highly skilled agent sent by the Ministry of Defense. He is strict but also aids into developing the assassination skills of the students, and eventually become bonded with the class as well despite his stoic and dense personality, and suppressing his emotions because of his profession. It is also undeniable that there is a small degree of fanservice appeal brought by bitch-sensei, Irina, but again this revolves around the whole theme of assassination and is also manifestation of her assassination skills. Nevertheless, she also grows along with the rest of the students as well as Koro-sensei and Karasuma-sensei.<br />
<br />
The comedy is extremely well done. Ranging from Koro-sensei’s ridiculousness and his admiration for erotic magazines, to Karma’s sadistic torturing methods of sticking chilli and spicy paste into someone’s nostrils, the majority of the humour derives from the main central plot of assassination, and just goes to show how immense of a theme this is and how much it can develop the show.  <br />
<br />
Unlike the bland special of Assassination Classroom that was animated by Brain’s Base in 2013, Lerche takes Assassination Classroom to a whole new level through its distinct art style. The art style makes use of conspicuous shadows, bold borders and outlines to highlight and define each individual character. The backgrounds also look nice and are vibrant when it needs to be, and dark when it needs to be as well. The details of objects look precise through the neat and clear art. Ultimately, the anime is able to bring out the manga’s great art to life, if not, even better, taking it to a new level. The animation involved in showcasing Koro-sensei’s super speed and the subsequent surrounding environment looks phenomenal and very fluid, bringing Koro-sensei to life. <br />
<br />
Sound wise, both openings ‘Seishun Satsubatsu-ron’ and ‘Jiriki Hongan Revolution’ fit the show perfectly. Being upbeat and lively, the music itself pumps you up for the episode before it starts and brightens up the atmosphere. Visually, they involve the introduction of the characters of Class E and feature the characters dancing in a very comical manner which I definitely love and find hilarious. The soundtrack is also used appropriately most of the time, using suspenseful music at suspenseful moments, sentimental tracks at the more sympathetic scenes, as well as a short electronic/techno sounding track during thrilling moments such as when Ritsu analyses the floor plan during the hotel infiltration. <br />
<br />
The ending song itself ‘Hello, shooting-star’ by moumoon is a masterpiece and depicts a more emotional approach to the show with its lighthearted and sentimental tone. The visuals are stunning utilising a chalkboard and chalks to visualise the ending song with its characters. For me, every time this ending plays I never skip it, and instead, I envision what it would be like if Koro-sensei were to actually be killed, and how emotional it would truly be. <br />
<br />
With a second season confirmed in production, we can expect to see more intriguing arcs, more suspenseful moments, as well as increasingly more characterisation and story development as the show unfolds itself.<br />
<br />
Undoubtedly, Assassination Classroom diverges from the ordinary anime, and transforms norms into a show that is original, unique and creative. Through the central plot, the show is able to merge both assassination and education to develop the cast as a whole, manifest individual growth and exhibit the interlinking bonds of the class. Not only this, but this is a show that truly allows you to learn from its many underlying didactic messages as well, both subtle and explicit. And I certainly recommend everyone to try out Assassination Classroom at some point because this is a show that has shown me both inspiration and motivation.<br />

    My first view of AC(assassination classroom) was that the main character was too kiddy like. But after several pushes from my friends, I finally decided to give it a try. True, the main character might look girlish, weak and elementary school, he is actually very strong. <br />
The plot is simply amazing and fulfilling all aspects that I enjoy watching. They were very detailed and the jokes/comedy moments softened the serious moments, making it even more enjoyable. <br />
The Art is splendid, so if you are getting tired of finding anime with art like One Piece(no offense), you can try this. <br />
The character development is also fascinating.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227909">
        It is neatly done and there aren&#039;t really any holes in them.<br />
So all in all, I am giving this a ten! Plus, it has a second season so I didn&#039;t have to go anime hunting that soon after the first season. <br />
So if you are not sure or on the edge, just trust me and give the first few episodes a try. You will enjoy it if you like Mystery, Action, and Fights.  Or Highschool settings.

    Confession: I originally rated this 8/10 when it first came out nearly three years ago. I enjoyed it, but didn&#039;t love it. I thought it was clever and funny, but it didn&#039;t really stick with me. <br />
<br />
But with the stress of university exams and life expectations, I&#039;ve been rewatching a lot of old shows I&#039;d once forgot about and I realized something about Assassination Classroom that I somehow failed to see the first time around: This show is kind of freaking perfect. <br />
<br />
SUMMARY: <br />
You&#039;ve probably heard the basic synopsis of this show a million times before, but I&#039;ll recap it real quick for you anyway.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268883">
        Basically, Assassination Classroom revolves around a class of third-year middle school kids who have, for all intents and purposes, been deemed the &quot;losers of the End Class&quot; as part of some social hierarchy cultivated by their prestigious school&#039;s villainous principal. These kids are mocked and demeaned by the other students, hidden away in a small shack on a mountain away from the main campus -- and if that wasn&#039;t enough, they&#039;ve been tasked with learning to be assassins to kill their giant, tentacled &quot;teacher&quot; who is unconventional in every way and happens to have a top speed of Mach 20. If they don&#039;t manage to kill him in one year, he&#039;s going to blow up the earth like he blew up the moon. <br />
<br />
Sounds weird to you? You&#039;re right -- it IS weird. But it&#039;s also hilarious, ridiculously clever, and wholly original while managing to hit all your favourite archetypes in the best possible way. <br />
<br />
And, NO. Just because there&#039;s a tentacle monster and a big-breasted English teacher does not mean this is hentai. Get your head out of the gutter. This is so far from hentai, I should take y&#039;all to church just for thinking it. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: <br />
The best part of this anime is by far the amazing cast of characters. First, we have Nagisa Shiota, our awkward, unassuming, and ridiculously adorable narrator of sorts, who has a slightly androgynous appearance that makes for hilarious gags where his best friends like to dress him up as a girl, and he has a low self-esteem without being the pitiable fool they often cast in any sort of SOL/harem anime (which this definitely isn&#039;t). He may seem adorably defenseless and sweet like a newborn puppy, but when it comes to assassination, he&#039;s a natural born pro -- and not in an unrealistic OP way where it doesn&#039;t fit with his character. He may not be the best fighter and he&#039;s definitely not the strongest, but he has a killer instinct which is masked by his utter adorableness that stuns both his classmates and the audience again and again in really cool fight scenes and assassination attempts. If you dislike Nagisa, I dislike you. It&#039;s that simple. Don&#039;t hate my baby. <br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Karma Akabane, everyone&#039;s favourite sociopath. He&#039;s ruthless, intelligent, and indisputably the best in his class. Watching him direct his teammates during complicated battle strategies and assassinations is nothing short of captivating. His cleverness and ability to foresee anything is incredible, and the way he is able to remain calm and condescending in almost every situation is the perfect compliment to his sarcastic back-talk and hilarious sadistic tendencies, a lot of which tend to revolve around teasing Nagisa. (Warning: Their bromance is freaking adorable.) <br />
<br />
Of course, we can&#039;t forget Koro-sensei! He&#039;s big, he&#039;s yellow, he&#039;s a bit of a perv -- he also happens to be the teacher everyone wishes they had and a surprising tugger of heartstrings. I don&#039;t want to write much about him without spoiling, so let me just say that while he may initially seem like an octopus pervert meant for comic relief and plot direction, he&#039;s much more than that. A LOT more than that. <br />
<br />
But here&#039;s the thing: Those three may be listed as the &quot;main&quot; characters, but they definitely aren&#039;t the only ones you&#039;ll love. The cast here is huge and hilarious and individual and fun. While I have a ridiculous love for Nagisa, Karma, and Koro-sensei, so many of the other people in Class 3-E also managed to steal my heart, like poor Prince Charming Isogai, beautiful yet nondescript class idol Kanzaki, and SFA Karasama whose main purpose is supposed to be to teach the kids assassination techniques but is really to add a swoon factor for both the audience and Professor Bitch. I could individually describe every single one of them, but I don&#039;t want this review to turn into a gushing novel so I&#039;ll spare you my inner nerd. <br />
<br />
Large casts are usually a hit or miss with me. You tend to like some characters and hate others, but here, I was a hog. I wanted them all. They all had their quirks, their strengths, and their weaknesses, and the way they interacted as a class was hilarious and perfect and fun. They complimented each other and stood out from each other, and let me just say that two seasons with these rascals was nowhere near enough to satisfy me. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: <br />
Watch this show. Seriously, watch it. I don&#039;t waste my time writing reviews for just anything -- or at all -- but this show made me so damn happy and full of giggles that I just had to share the love. So you should watch it then come befriend me so we can gush over it together.

    My Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) review...the re-post.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Ok, the plot........kill the space alien octopus within the span of one year or it will destroy planet earth...........the men.....a group of middle school losers whom were train by the antagonist itself to kill him....their mission, kill him with in one school year and if successful they will get a 10 billion yen which is roughly about $100 million . Well, the plot was really unique and quite frankly I kinda like the idea behind it. But, on a moral basis, the plot was really twisted where one can&#039;t imagine that class 3E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School were train

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191102">
        to develop killer instinct which come with the training of the antagonist and the teachers, so the story itself was very much crazy and not much of any sense in even if it was meant as entertainment. <br />
<br />
<br />
My verdict: A poor 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art <br />
<br />
Basically I would have give it a 2 since the anime itself still follows the usual cliche of MC&#039;s having their own uniform designed, I mean really Nagisa has to be this bishonen with female features, geeez now why didn&#039;t author Matsui, Yuusei portrayed him as a cute bishojo instead of a bishonen? Also , I kinda hate Karma having his own coat color instead of wearing his school&#039;s standard grey. Then again the silver lining here is Bitch sensei were she is as hot as hell, still I&#039;m not much impress with this anime&#039;s art even in it&#039;s manga form.....then again the live version is as worse as the anime and manga combine.<br />
<br />
My verdict: A poor 3<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
I gonna give a high score for the opening OST which is “Seishun Satsubatsuron” and &quot;&quot;Jiriki Hongan Revolution&quot; by 3-nen E-Gumi Utatan.<br />
<br />
So my verdict: An outstanding 10.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
I&#039;m only gonna focus on those who made an impact into this anime, since I haven&#039;t gone with the manga yet.<br />
<br />
Koro-sensei, if you look at him he was really portrayed as a funny antagonist , but unlike other antagonist he&#039;s one antagonist that one would love, ok so he gonna destroy earth just like what he did with the moon, big deal. Also, what make his character special was that it wasn&#039;t something that one needs to worry about- I mean his character in general is something that one wouldn&#039;t care whether he get&#039;s killed or not. You might say that the class of 3E are more annoying than Koro sensei.<br />
<br />
Nagisa Shiota, ok so wtf did author Matsui, Yuusei made him into a boy with female features we&#039;ll never know, what I do know was that I really dislike him also, I really hate how his character was being exaggerated an innocent boy with a very deadly killer instinct.If author Matsui, Yuusei have made him a girl then his character would have added a good femme fetal into the whole series which was too bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Karma Akabane, I kinda like that he plays as this quintessential talking trash guy who can deliver, but, one part of me wants to see him gets owned by bigger guys which it did, but still hated him in the few episodes of the anime where he get&#039;s to owned a profession killer who was trying to get him. However it was rather unfortunate that he didn&#039;t get to duke out with the main antagonist Akira Takaoka where in my opinion would have also give this anime a good climax.<br />
<br />
Akira Takaoka, ok so he is the quintessential antagonist that one would love to hate, but I kind hate it that he never went it for the kill when he faced Nagisa for the second time where his character really did fall short of what was expected of him. And I always wanted to see him duke out with Karma.<br />
<br />
Irina &quot;Bitch-sensei&quot; Jelavić, ok so kinda like her for being this quintessential bimbo, then again that&#039;s what she is an eye candy of this anime.<br />
<br />
Tadaomi Karasuma, if Bitch sensei is the eye candy for this anime then that make him the quintessential guy who just looks around and manages, you know I&#039;d wsih that he and Bitch sensei would have a serious relationship, where either he kills her or she kills him kind of thing.<br />
<br />
So my verdict: a good 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
The enjoyment part here wasn&#039;t whether the 3e class would be able to kill Koro sensei or what, the enjoyment stems as to how the next episode would go, it might not be boring , but the experience of watching it was that it wasn&#039;t something that one would expect something to happen to Koro sensei, but what would the kids of class 3E would be up to... or what would anybody be up to to get Koro sensei for that matter.<br />
<br />
My verdict: good 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
It maybe enjoyable, but definitely not for kids ages 12 and below, since there is no moral lesson in it , just random streaks of kids form 3E who are up to something to Koro sensei, other than that , there isn&#039;t much. <br />
<br />
My final verdict: a decent 4.<br />
<br />
<br />

    8.8/10<br />
In my own opinion, this is one of my favourite winter anime of 2015.<br />
<br />
To start off, the story was very intriguing. After all, it has an octopus teacher capable of destroying 70% of the moon. The fact that junior high kids were also trained to be assassins really struck a chord with me. I thought it was quite an original story, and I have never watched an anime like this. However, some characters do not develop as much as I would have liked. The creators did develop most of the important characters such as Nagisa, Karma, and a few other characters, meanwhile the rest of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192578">
        the class stayed rather stagnant in terms of developing, and we only learn one or two things about them. The villains were also well created, giving them an authentic feel. They aren&#039;t average villains who would rob a bank, but would instead create plots that would prove to be a large problem for 3-E. One problem that I saw, though, was the comedy proved to be a bit repetitive and annoying.<br />
<br />
The art style was great. In terms of quality, it was very good, with clear lines and defined faces. They make some lines on a characters&#039; face thicker, which creates an excellent effect. It was a very refreshing art style, and none of the characters looked out of place in the classroom.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack and sound effect of this anime were excellent. The music has a very unique sound to it and really helps to set the mood. Whether it be a happy moment, or an intense moment, the soundtrack was great and I personally loved the way it sounded. It added more emphasis to any scene, especially the ones that had darker moments. The sound effects sounded natural and not artificial.<br />
<br />
Character development was a bit slow, and the director only developed a few main characters. I would have liked to see Koro-sensei develop more, but he didn&#039;t really say anything about his past. At best, there were a few flashbacks, but that was it. Karasuma and Irina don&#039;t develop much as well, but seeing both of them change to adapt to the conditions that were set in the classroom was very interesting. I enjoyed seeing Nagisa and Karma develop. When you first look at Nagisa, since he was in 3-E, he was often made fun of. But throughout the anime, you slowly start to see him develop into more and more of an assassin. Karma&#039;s development became really evident in the second half of the anime. I really enjoyed seeing his character change, and personally, he is my favorite character.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching this anime. I have rewatched it, and I enjoyed every second of it. I waited for Friday to come so I could watch it. However, after the 11th episode, it stopped coming out temporarily, before resuming again. <br />
Overall, I really liked this anime. it was great, with an original story, great soundtrack, and a unique array of characters. I only wish that there was more developing of the story and characters.

    While the anime came out a few years back, I have only gotten around to watching Assassination Classroom recently. I felt EXTREMELY compelled to write a review on the show after deciding to drop it.<br />
<br />
I find that a way to describe Assassination Classroom (at least, in a way I believe to be accurate), it to imagine a piece of paper that has &quot;GOOD CONCEPT&quot; written on it in black marker. Then, imagine handing that piece of paper to a toddler with a box of sharpies and telling them to go hog wild. Eventually, you cant even read the original phrase because it is just covered

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291292">
        in nonsense.<br />
<br />
GENERAL OPINION:<br />
I was drawn to Assassination Classroom for its concept. The idea of a classroom of kids trying to kill their (somehow charming) alien teacher before he destroys the planet is exciting, and dare I say, unique! The design seemed okay, the characters seemed okay- nothing appeared like it was below average quality. My opinion at the start of the show followed this belief too.<br />
<br />
But eventually, the scribbled-on-paper mess appeared before me. Assassination Classroom has one HELL of a plot going on... so why does almost 1/4th of the episodes not even develop it? This season is FULL of filler episodes, none really adding any progress to the students goal of killing their teacher OR even adding to character development. To me, it felt as though I had been watching for an hour when only 1 episode had gone by. Everything was so agonizingly slow (both slow to develop and slow to even unfold the events in each episode). <br />
<br />
I would like to mention that I do not mind shows that are slow and take time to unfold, such as Steins;Gate. BUT, unlike most shows that use this strategy, Assassination Classroom fails to even try and keep the viewer anticipating what will happen at the end of the buildup. It is honestly wasted episode time that could be spent in so many better ways.<br />
<br />
OPENING:<br />
Not to be /that/ guy, but the first OP is one of the worst ones I have ever heard. The lyrics are quite cute, since they have all to do with the actual theme of the show, but but but the music itself just... does not flow right. It does not &quot;hype me up&quot; or get me into the &quot;mood&quot; for the show. Unless the point of it was to make me get to the show faster by skipping it, the OP could have easily been anything else and would have been better.<br />
<br />
SIDENOTE: <br />
While this is not a legit critique of the show, it completely bothered me how happy the students were 99% of the time during the show. It seemed like every time they failed to kill their teacher, and were therefore one day closer to LITERALLY DYING, they all would just laugh the event off and pull a &quot;teehee haha sensei youre just too good! Back to math time!&quot;. WHY are none of the actual students bothered in the slightest by this! WHY is everybody just so calm about their impending doom! okay thats all<br />
<br />
RATING:<br />
I decided to give this show a 5 because I will recognize the fact that this show has been admired highly by most people, so there must be some appeal to it that only I am not catching onto. It was not the worst anime I have seen, but it has so far been the only anime I have decided was so bad I had to drop.   <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading :)

    Assassination Classroom is one of the biggest anime for 2015 (which so far has been disapointting to say the least) but does it desreve all this praise and more imporantly is it actaully any good well i will answer that in this review<br />
<br />
Story-7<br />
The story of a teacher who is a squid improveing students grades though assassination is as stupid as it sounds and the anime knows thisit dosnt want to be deeper and for that im fine with this however the main story dosnt work becuase none of the attempts of assiassinating him are going ot work we know this the anime is 22 eps

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192153">
        long so everyone knows for at least the first 20 eps hes not going to die and becuase of that the tenison from most of the eariler assassinations aint there the second storys it does are short stories tohughout the anime with characters it randomly picked out of a hat it seems these range from bad to good with some being intresting and some completly failing to hit the mark becuase of this the story is good its a watchable decent plot for a stupid comedy anime to use.<br />
<br />
Art-6<br />
Im not good at noticing good animation but i saw many scene is assassination cassroom where the art wasnt at it best for most of the anime its good and looks colourful and nice but there are a couple of scenes where i notice how bad it and for me that rare.<br />
<br />
Sound-7<br />
the sound is alright the first OP and the ending songs are very good giveing you are idea (and when two of the characters join the classroom ithere join the OP that was clever) but the second OP (after ep 12) failed due to it being too slow for this anime and most of the music was just above average and for that the anime only has decent sound when it comes to music the voice actors are very well chosen but unlike some other anime none of them stood out so for that the sound gets another averge rating<br />
<br />
Characters-3<br />
This is Assassination Classroom this is what separtes a good comedy and a bad comedy  and as you can tell Assassination Classroom fails this test none of the character grow half of them are not shown and if you remeber all there names then well done but it gets worse becuase despite having 24 characters in the classroom we get more side characters from the main school leading to over 30 characters who appear in 2 or more eps but this would be fine if the main charaacters get devoplement and our main character is nagisa a boy (who looks cute as a girl)  and he gets wasted he appares in every ep said to be smart and a great assassination but that it we get no backstory no arc just he becomes good one day due to training hard such a waste but then comes the other main character the teacher Koro-sensei who is amazing but nothing more then comic releaf for the story he helps the classmates and thats it nothing more he&#039;s backstory is hinted at but in 22 eps we never see it so thats another missed oppartunity for us to care about him theres more characters in the classroom but 16 of them are not given an ep 4 are given an ep and are ok and 2 are actaullly very well rouned characters (Karma and  Terasaka) both the teacher however shine are despite them being side character for koro-sensei become quickly the best part of this show overalll character are bad becuase despite a very large cast only 4 i found to be given decent character devoplement<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-9<br />
i loved Assassination Classroom and if wasnt being a crtic about it i would score it much higher becuase i had a blast many funny scene and time flys when i watched it i see why its popular becuase i like most people had  blast and i look foward to season 2 when it airs next year<br />
<br />
Overall-6<br />
Assassination Classroom is a fun mess of an anime its fun be fails when you look it (like most popular anime) and for that i cant give it a higher score i would recommaned this anime just dont look to in to it or you will see it problems <br />
thanks for reading :)

    A review of *Assassination Classroom, the popular shounen anime with a ridiculous concept.*<br />
<br />
*Plot: 5.5/10-* AssClass follows an episodic and arc format with episodes that either focus on a student or a specific event, and as with many episodic anime, the results are hit and miss. Episodes can range from great to okay to an absolute mess. Many of the individual episodes that focus on nothing of note to the overall story are often the most entertaining and contain the best humor. Those episodes are the ones that kept me coming back. On the other hand, the mediocre episodes, and the occasional terrible episodes, are the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191211">
        ones that try to expand on the main plot. Sometimes the elements introduced work fairly well, but other times, the plot falls flat on its face. <br />
<br />
*Entertainment Value: 7.9/10-* For me, AssClass&#039; main draw is the humor and entertainment value. While technically being a comedy, AssClass does not seem to try to be funny often enough. It does not make me laugh-out-loud more than one or twice an episode at most and yet the majority of episodes are still amusing throughout. This is best aspect of AssClass; it is simply fun to watch. It might not be engrossing, and it starts to wear out its welcome at points, but the series often kept me entertained.<br />
<br />
My review might make Assassination Classroom sound like a bad anime and that is not the case; it is a fun show to watch. However, whether or not you will like AssClass depends on how enjoyable you find the essentially &quot;pointless&quot; episodic episodes, because if you apply any logic to the main plot, it falls apart. With its insane popularity in Japan and a second season on the way, you will be seeing more of Assassination Classroom in the future.<br />
_Watch if you like:_ Shounen, Comedy, Lack of progression<br />
*-6.5/10*<br />

    Assassination Classroom is one of those shows that you read the premise of and you go &quot;What the absolute fuck is this&quot;, and I don&#039;t blame you. The students of Kunugigaoka Junior High School&#039;s Class 3-E are assigned to assassinate a highly dangerous octopus who will destroy the world by next year if he&#039;s not killed, and he&#039;s also there teacher. Some pretty wacky stuff, however that&#039;s the kinda stuff I love, stupid, bizarre, outlandish and has piles upon piles of personality <br />
<br />
Q: Should you read Assassination classroom?<br />
<br />
A: Yeah! Absolutely. I wouldn&#039;t call this entry level anime but it&#039;s certainly an anime that I think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359625">
        that anyone regardless of genre preferences can enjoy. <br />
<br />
~THE REVIEW~<br />
<br />
[STORY - 9/10]<br />
Assassination classroom is one of the wackiest anime plots I have ever heard, if you took the summary of this anime showed it to some random person who had never heard about it and give no context to what it is there reaction would be &quot;wtf&quot;. The plot may be wacky but behind it is a surprisingly mature anime, especially for a shonen manga which is genre which is littered with bland and childish cash grabs *cough*Boruto*cough*. The story is constantly engaging, the mysteries and interesting scenarios will keep you coming back for more each episodes. The different arcs show a variety of different character personalities and characters strengths and weaknesses. I enjoyed the wide variety of genres in the each arc.<br />
<br />
[ART - 8/10]<br />
To believe that some of the animation was done in 3D is amazing to me, it took me like 3 rewatches before I found out that it was partially done with 3D animation, the blend of 2D and 3D is basically seamless. The art style on its own isn&#039;t all that amazing, in fact it&#039;s pretty bland but it&#039;s consistent and has good production value.<br />
<br />
[SOUND - 9/10] <br />
This anime has a great OST, it has a fitting track list and some pretty emotional music. The various openings are great. The first two openings Seishun Satsubatsuron and Jiriki Hongan Revolution are both fun and befitting for the tone of the first season. The ending song Hello, shooting star is an emotionally poignant ending capturing the more melancholic side of the anime. The voice acting is pretty good, Koro-sensei is basically a high pitched Lelouch and Karma and Nagisa the two leads have pretty good voices, the side cast isn&#039;t all that memorable but some voices stand out like Karasuma and Asano Gakushuu. <br />
<br />
[CHARACTERS - 9/10]<br />
The characters are great, mostly the main cast, like most long running shonen series Assassination classroom suffers from a good dose of Lack-of-side-character-character-development however each of the side characters at least have a defining character trait and serve the story in some way. The main characters Karma, Nagisa and Koro-sensei are pretty good. They bring and emotional depths and edge to the story, The characters are really good and certainly what makes this one of my favourite anime of all time.<br />
<br />
[ENJOYMENT AND OVERALL SCORE -10/10]<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. The characters the music and the story are just too perfect. Theres a lot to love about assassination classroom and it&#039;s one of the best anime I have seen period.<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
This will be a short review especially compared to my others but I don&#039;t have a whole lot to say and I just want to go off on a few issues. <br />
<br />
First I wanna say that this show is...fine, it&#039;s passable. The cast of characters while nothing amazing is entertaining enough that even if the plot is complete ass (main point of the review), the show can be enjoyable. I didn&#039;t expect this a whole lot, as the show has an odd sense of humor for me in that it&#039;s just either mildly enjoyable or cringe. Notice how I didn&#039;t say &quot;funny&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386233">
        because it never made me laugh, even in my head. Also the show has a lot of forced narration which is really annoying, especially with character intros. Instead of showing off the characters, Nagisa, the MC, gives us a generic character description and we move on. It feels like such lazy writing and it&#039;s not just limited to character intros but backgrounds to setting or how the school works as well. <br />
<br />
I think it&#039;s important to note that this show is primarily chill, it&#039;s not intended to be plot heavy, but in the ladder parts it&#039;s 100% plot focused and it works awfully. I swear this makes Naruto look surprising. There were many moments where it seemed the show was trying to build suspense or be like &quot;oh no, the kids could REALLY die this time&quot; but they always have some plot armor to get out of it. I always knew the outcome and never felt even slightly inclined to keep watching to figure out if I was right. Once near the end I guess they were fighting this dude who was really good at listening to where people were, and somehow replaced a kid with a full sized dummy which isn&#039;t awful or anything in and of itself. But they do stuff like this every single time there is supposed to be a shred of suspense so instead everything just sorta happens with no actual reason to care or be invested. Also they never did explain how they got that dummy in the first place, they weren&#039;t in a scenario where they had access to a lot of gear. Anyway, I&#039;m only about 30 episodes into Naruto right now, but at least Naruto has the balls to make primary characters lose fights like Naruto vs. Orochimaru at the beginning of the Chuunin exams. While I won&#039;t call Naruto particularly suspenseful or anything, it does a hell of a lot better than AssClass because at least we know Naruto *could* lose whereas in AssClass no victory ever feels earned and we know they&#039;re just gonna win everything. I also find it strange that these amateur assassins can kill 4 trained world class ones back to back but hey I can&#039;t say I was surprised. Even when the show isn&#039;t plot heavy, the smaller plot lines aren&#039;t too interesting and still have this shonen plot armor problem that is somehow worse than most other stuff I&#039;ve seen. This is all also ignoring that a lot of the plot lines and happenings in the show are stupid even before the plot armor. At the very end of the show (this is a spoiler btw), they fight a dude who has an antidote to cure their friends of a deadly virus. But there was no reason to fight him because they had a loaded gun and could&#039;ve shot him on sight. I hate when something has an extremely obvious solution and they ignore it. Oh and apparently the whole point of the final arc of season 1, the deadly virus, wasn&#039;t even deadly and would&#039;ve worn off in like a day. And the hired deadly assasins who have killed a lot of people saved the kids from the actual deadly virus I guess??? Fucking laughable, I actually can&#039;t beieive someone wrote it.<br />
<br />
I know complaining about plot armor in a shonen anime is like complaining about having chicken in a chicken burrito, but I just thought it was handled absolutely awfully here and thought it was worth a mention. It was more like a chicken burrito, but the chicken sucks and the burrito is like 80% chicken, 10% shell, and 10% lettuce, cheese, and other stuff. Again as I said this show is passable, characters are entertaining enough, and I haven&#039;t mentioned it yet but the art is super clean. Just how did they make the plot armor this fucking bad?

    Overall, this series was just okay. Korosensei was by far the star of the show. However, despite the show’s attempt to focus episodes on individual students, none of the other characters caught my interest quite like the unkillable, yellow octopus teacher. I also couldn’t help but find myself a bit confused on how all these kids are almost always seeming to have a good time despite the fact that they are tasked with having to kill their teacher by the end of the school year to save their planet. Obviously once starting the show you realize it is really more about how Korosensei is nurturing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357731">
        his students to reach their true potential rather than how they learn to assassinate him, but I can’t imagine I’d be relaxed in that position. So, I found parts of the series to drag on as I wondered how it would end because it became quite apparent that the students wouldn’t actually be murdering their beloved teacher this season. Speaking of, the ending of season 1 seemed a bit random.<br />
<br />
In addition to that critique, I found much of the humor in the show to feel rather juvenile, but it is far from the cringiest I’ve seen in an anime.<br />
<br />
I would still recommend this series at least as something to watch in the background while playing a game or cleaning. Korosensei is quite interesting, &amp; while he isn’t enough to carry this show to a higher ranking, he definitely did get me to crack a smile a few times throughout watching.

    It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve done a review, hasn&#039;t it? I don&#039;t actually remember the last one I did a review on. Okay. Now that you&#039;ve gathered in front of me... well not me, but this text, let&#039;s get this review started.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
The story of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is about a alien octopus-creature thingy that destroys the moon and is going to destroy the earth next. A bunch of students with utter-shit grades are told to assassinate him before next year, or, before graduation. I mean, literally, utter-shit grades, they&#039;re grades suck, so they&#039;re in the E-Class. A.k.a, End Class. End Class is also known

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196814">
        as the Assassination Classroom (WHAAT?! NAME OF DA SHOW! ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED) and well, yeah, the story is simple, yet somehow manages to entertain me.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art/animation whatever the heck you wanna call it, feels somewhat different to other 2015 titles... I don&#039;t know why, it just looks different than... well other 2015 titles. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s bad, it&#039;s just something I&#039;m not used to. There&#039;s a possibility they wanted it to look like that, and that&#039;s okay, but... just not used to it. That&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is pretty good, I mean, I usually download the opening of every single anime I watch, and, yeah, the openings were good (I preferred the first one, though.) and I never really paid much attention to the other songs that were played in the background and such. But, when I did happen to download the soundtrack, I loved almost every single song that was in it. Great soundtrack, automatic install.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
<br />
The characters are okay, but... they lack development. I mean, a few characters had great developments, but... other than that, the other characters need more development. I&#039;m sure they will in the future, as I have not read the manga, but for this season, I&#039;m going to say that they lack development. Other than that (yes, i said it again) all the characters in the show are great.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
<br />
The series overall wasn&#039;t the most fascinating series I&#039;ve ever seen in my life, but it was okay. To be honest, I don&#039;t think my current favorite anime that&#039;s in my favorite anime list will leave any time soon, cuz&#039; they&#039;re pretty good. I mean, Monster &amp; Code Geass mate? What can pass dat? I just need to watch more anime, I guess.
