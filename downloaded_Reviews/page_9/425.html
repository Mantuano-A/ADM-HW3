    At the start of watching Gin no Saji, I was unsure of what to think about it. I thought it would be just a fun little slice of life anime, but what I got far exceeded my expectations.<br />
<br />
Gin no Saji is the perfect example that we each have the ability to set our own path and believe what we want to believe. And even if we face adversity we still stand by our beliefs.<br />
<br />
Personally I have never seen an anime in which a city boy was placed in a farming school, so kudos to the maker of the manga for doing it well. The anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118777">
        misses no opportunities to put the main character, Hachiken, into situations far outside of his comfort zone, thus leading to hilarious developments. But don&#039;t let the comedy fool you, because there are moments in this anime where they ask the tough questions, and you may see things in a different light by the end. Another plus is that there&#039;s never too much focus on one side character at a time, and instead they all develop together through their interactions with Hachiken. The story progresses at a steady pace, which allows viewers to get to know the characters, but also prevents boredom by giving you a nice change of scenery every episode or two. If the beginning was a little less slow it would be perfect.<br />
<br />
Now the art is very well done, and for some of the farm equipment and the more movement oriented scenes it is incredibly detailed and flows almost seamlessly. But, I have to take off some points for the lack of  movement during a good portion of the dialogue oriented scenes.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack wasn&#039;t much to write home about, but I did enjoy the opening and none of the tracks felt out of place. On another note, the Japanese voice acting was well done, and I felt that most of them fit there characters perfectly. Even better than that though, is that I found none of their voices to be annoying and normally there is at least one.<br />
<br />
What really sets this anime apart for me is the characters. Not because they are necessarily original character concepts, but because they each add something to the story, whether it&#039;s laughs, insight, or even their worries about the future.<br />
<br />
Overall, I very much enjoyed this anime and would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about watching it.

    “Because of the life they were born into, they are immediately stuck as an existence that can’t even choose their own life and death.”<br />
<br />
Such is the life of livestock. Chickens are killed to be eaten if they don’t lay enough eggs; horses are immediately retired or put to rest if they don’t win any competitions or get injured; and pigs and cows are sold at a really cheap price if they do not eat enough. Behind the scenes of our farms and their livestock, the idea of the “survival of the fittest” is more clear-cut and harsh than it is in human society. However, humans

          <span style="display: none;" id="review107979">
        are judged equally as harsh by the results they produce. In a generation that values the credentials of people more than the people themselves, people who fall behind even a little bit are often shunned or overlooked, just as if they are worthless livestock. Therefore, people of all ages, especially those that are younger, are put under a tremendous amount of pressure to succeed and sometimes forced to take on undesired paths for life. And sadly enough, running away never seems to be an option…<br />
<br />
Or does it?<br />
<br />
Gin no Saji (Silver Spoon) tells the story of Hachiken Yugo, a boy that decides to go to an agricultural boarding school far away from home after getting rejected from the high school he was aiming for. Hachiken’s tunnel vision to get into the high school causes him to lose sight of what he really wants to do, and so he chooses the agricultural school to get away from being considered a failure. All of us, especially in our teenage and early adult years, can relate to this experience one way or another: the fact that you work diligently towards a goal and realize soon after that the goal can never be reached is a daunting and depressing thing. To make matters worse, you are forced to see your peers achieve that same goal and become afraid of them lest they judge you for failing. You want to escape, but sometimes the pressure from society, from your family and your friends, all chain you down to sometimes lead the life that you don’t necessarily want.<br />
<br />
So for all those that are troubled like Hachiken, I recommend this slice-of-life anime series. One of the core things that Gin no Saji teaches the viewers is to take a break from all that unhealthy pressure for once and reflect upon what is most important FOR YOU in life. Luckily for Hachiken, he is surrounded by classmates that are all passionate about what they want to do in life. For someone without a goal, seeing determined people who constantly pursue their goal may be discouraging but motivating at the same time. This indirect pressure encourages Hachiken to think earnestly about what he wants to do in life. The new experiences and fun memories made at this new school start to bring out a new side of Hachiken that surprises those that have known him in the past.<br />
<br />
The magic of the character of Hachiken is that he came in knowing absolutely nothing about the agricultural high school. At least for me, I could personally relate to Hachiken, only because I had to face the same amount of pressure to do well in school. But not only that, just as Hachiken felt bad for the farm animals being killed off out of obligation, I did too; just as Hachiken had to wake up every morning around five to do work, I could relate to how painful that would be; and just as Hachiken felt indirectly pressured by his passion-driven friends, I did too. That’s why this character is really dear to me, and his development as a person is all the more exciting as this series goes on.<br />
<br />
But if the story of Hachiken Yugo and his friends don’t appeal to you, Gin no Saji has high educational value. If you’ve ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the agricultural businesses and farms, then this anime gives you a glimpse of what it’s like. And in addition to the fun facts about farm animals, equipment, and techniques, the anime takes on philosophical views on what the animals teach humans, and how the animals should be treated. For one thing, everyone in this anime has deep rooted respect for livestock. There are owners that hold extravagant funerals for horses to honor them; there are people who appreciate the animals for providing them a new insight or viewpoint in life; and there are people who make the necessary killing of farm animals as quick and painless as possible. Finally, this anime touches upon not only the future of the agricultural and farming businesses, but also sensitive topics such as animal cruelty and cloning. I value this anime highly because of what it teaches me, each and every episode.<br />
<br />
Since Gin no Saji was in an entirely different setting, background, and pacing from Fullmetal Alchemist, I laid off the manga after two chapters or so. But the anime brought me back to the manga, and what a delight it’s been. As a fan of the slice-of-life genre, Gin no Saji is without a doubt a fresh addition to my list. I look forward to more heartfelt and warm moments awaiting Hachiken and his friends at Oezo Agricultural High School!<br />

Review by MAL criteria<br />
<br />
Story: The synopsis is available in the MAL page as well as in the second big paragraph of this review. What gives the story an overall 10 is the number of characters that have very relatable and realistic problems and backgrounds. In addition, as mentioned before, the anime has educational value, as it teaches the viewers about farm animals, equipment, techniques, and the logistics of agricultural and farming businesses. Rarely do we consider a slice-of-life anime with educational value anything from interesting, but Hiromu Arakawa manages to pull it off.<br />
<br />
Music: The opening song “Kiss you” by Miwa is a sweet and carefree song, but nothing too memorable. The ending song “Hello Especially” is sung by Sukima Switch, who also sang “Golden Time Lovers” from the third opening of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I mention this because Sukima Switch chose to sing a country song for this anime (rather than rock), and no doubt, the song is catchy and fits perfectly to the anime. Besides that, the soundtracks introduced thus far are nothing too special, but they often give you a very warm countryside feeling when you hear them playing at certain parts. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Art: As the anime is in an agricultural setting, the scenery is pastoral and soothing. Not to mention the use of warm and bright colors to emphasize the warmth and homeliness of the environment. <br />
<br />
As it is a Hiromu Arakawa work, you will see similarities between Gin no Saji characters and Fullmetal Alchemist characters. The depiction of the characters stays true to the manga, and you’ll notice the similar reactions that Hiromu Arakawa likes to use. There is great detail and personification of animals so it is entertaining to see various expressions from these animals.<br />
<br />
Animation of this anime seems to be the most lacking of all the categories because it can get choppy and awkward at times. The animation is especially important because it is tied into delivering punchlines or depicting hilarious scenes, so the humor is not always delivered appropriately or properly conveyed due to the occasionally choppy animations. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Character: Season 1 of Gin no Saji is focused mostly on Hachiken&#039;s development from being a gloomy and uptight guy to a more confident and relaxed one. Viewers are introduced to other characters and their backgrounds, but the anime has yet to develop any of them. I rate this section highly, however, because of how well Hachiken&#039;s development is done. Viewers see Hachiken learning something different about himself, his friends, and his environment every episode, and in turn his friends learn something different about Hachiken each episode. I can’t wait to see him develop more and more, until the moment he figures out what he wants to do in life. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: On behalf of those who love this anime already, let me say to those reading this review that you’re missing out!! I can’t guarantee everyone will enjoy it, but I hope you do! <br />
<br />
8.8/10 <br />

    Life is what you make it, if anything, it’s far from perfect.<br />
<br />
In order to experience the true beauty of the world, we must accept the unimaginable situations we’ve been placed in, no matter how uncomfortable they may be. <br />
<br />
Dive into the world of agriculture ‘Gin no Saji’ otherwise known as ‘Silver Spoon’ in English. Our main character, Yugo Hachiken, who in desperation separates himself from his family and their ever growing expectations, enrolls into the boarding school Yezo High School. Carrying a quirky and half assed attitude, Hachiken quickly realizes that escaping the expectations of not only his family, but others as well  without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175283">
        having any aspirations of your own isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. This realization is even further amplified when he is surrounded by peers who seemingly already have their life planned out. If you can relate to this even in the most miniscule way, you should do yourself a favor and give this 11 episode season the time of day. <br />
<br />
As we journey deeper, it is Gin no Saji’s extremely strong cast that truly allows this anime to shine. With an episodic-like structure and an array of unique supporting characters, the awkwardness that is the situations Hachiken is thrown into, know no bounds. Through the eyes of the beholder, we are initially shown the ugly side of the agricultural world, filled with the squirms of Hachiken as he collects fresh chicken periods, becomes overly attached to baby livestock and witnesses the butchery of countless animals. But ever so slowly, Hachiken begins to settle in his new found home, and the beautiful side of this world begins to shine through. As previously stated, the supporting cast Gin no Saji is exceptionally strong. The unique personalities of each character are truly showcased, whether it’s Tokiwa’s eternal struggle with studying, the tit loving Holstein Club, or the iron will of Komaba. Each have their own aspirations which become evident throughout their daily interactions which creates a heartwarming tone.<br />
<br />
A-1 pictures generally have a high standard when it comes to artwork, and Gin no Saji is no exception. The vast majority is animated cleanly without any majorly distracting blemishes, characters are easily distinguishable, the scenery is drawn beautifully and the food is at a tantalizing level of animation. Heck, even the eggs fresh out a chicken’s bum looks delectable. <br />
<br />
If there was anything worthy of complaint in Gin no Saji it would be its background music, which more often than not doesn’t benefit the atmosphere the scene attempts to create. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a poor soundtrack by any means… it just doesn’t add much to the premises most of the time. It simply exists at an acceptable standard. Both the opening and ending themes give off a light hearted, rural feeling which compliments the themes of the anime quite well. When taking the above elements into consideration, the soundtrack as a whole is presented to an above par standard. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, chances are you’ll most likely enjoy this series even if you have absolutely no interest in the world of agriculture. Put plainly, Gin no Saji is a warm hearted slice of life filled with plenty of comedic and relatable moments, with an exceptionally strong cast of characters and beautiful visuals. Gin no Saji portrays its story in a simple, yet enjoyable fashion. So what are you waiting for? Take the plunge into the world known as Gin no Saji, and who knows? Maybe you’ll fall in love with the world of agriculture just like Hachiken did.<br />

    Everyone has dreams. In fact, dreams can come in all shapes or sizes. It be as simple as getting an A+ on a math exam or to something as difficult as winning a gold medal in the Olympics. The problem with dreams is though is that not everyone seems to be able to follow all the way through. It’s from dreams though that people learn about the world and about themselves. In Silver Spoon, we follow a main male protagonist named Yugo Hachiken as he embarks on a road for his future but one that he never expected to turn out to be.<br />

Gin no Saji

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113461">
        (also known by its English name Silver Spoon) is anime series based off of the manga of the same name written by Hiromu Arakawa. She is known already for her previous work, Full Metal Alchemist that has achieved universal praise for both its anime and manga creations. As a brand new series, we get to see an insight on her new work from a different perspective. This time, we get to witness the life of a farm boy in the field of agriculture as opposed to the military bases and struggles.<br />
<br />
For starters, this anime is influenced by the author’s real life childhood because she used to grow up on a dairy farm in Hokkaido. Therefore, we also get to see the author’s reflection of her past life in a sort of way. However, this time we step into the shoes of Hachiken as a student and see how his life is like. <br />
<br />
Hachiken is one of those character that seems to be unmotivated from the beginning. This is evidenced even from the very beginning in which he tries to get take an easy route by enrolling in an agricultural school. This might sound easy but it’s a lot harder once he opens his eyes to reality. The backstab comes to Hachiken’s part as he quickly finds out that all the students there are motivated by their desire to actually make a professional career out of their time spend there. For Hachiken though, this is more like a time of struggle. <br />
<br />
The various characters of this show makes it quite appealing since almost all of them seems to have a mind set on the future; that is almost everyone except for Hachiken. These goals ranges from inheriting a farm business, to become a veterinarian, or owning a chicken farm. At the same time, these characters all have their own style when they make their appearances. Take Shinnosuke for example. He seems to play a struggling role (although not on the same level from my perspective) in the series. Shinnosuke wants to become a vet but often fears at the sight of blood or animals. Then, there’s also Aki, a girl that is sometimes stereotyped as the pretty girl next door. In fact, she even fits this role literally with her love of horses. (a possible reference to girls’ love for ponies)<br />
<br />
The plot of the series follows a more slice-of-life format where it visualizes and presents how a person’s life is like as a student in the agricultural field. Surprisingly enough, it does make its sense of realism strong through the portrayal of its actions. These include cutting chickens’ heads off, milking cattle, cooking corns, and just an every day style of what is like to be a student at this agricultural school. For viewers however, it can be frustrating in the beginning to witness Hachiken’s life style because he shows little interest in the activities. This is especially true when he realizes how hard life can be on the farm. At the same time though, Hachiken progresses with his effort and learns more about his new life through experience. These experiences puts him in the driver’s seat for the first time on his road for a future. It is also in someway inspirational to see how he progresses throughout the show that might make people realize that dreams can come true.<br />
<br />
Among other interesting factors of the series includes the character interactions. For Hachiken, it’s important for him to make new friends in order to adjust. Thanks to his intellect though, he is able to earn the respect of his peers and possibly even the affection of his classmate, Aki. In fact, there are hints of romance in the series occasionally between Hachiken and Aki. This can be viewed as a more innocent factor of the show and often times or not, we get to witness the silly moments (sometimes misunderstandings as well) between the duo. The sparks are there though but usually Hachiken plays the role of the dummy. On the other hand, Aki’s cheerfulness makes it all more the worthwhile to watch. What might be more scary to watch is maybe her overprotective father as he plays the role of a dad who seems to care about her daughter more than he probably should.<br />
<br />
The series also brings a delightful doses of comedy to the show. In fact, it sometimes barely tries and succeeds in this field. This usually involves Hachiken and how he deals with the various farm animals with various results. In the beginning, most of this is almost absurd but later on spells out more hilarious moments as he gets first hands-on experience with the farm life. Trust me though, it’s a lot harder than what you see with your naked eye. It doesn’t end there as other characters such as Tamako even has her humorous moments and little gags that makes the show of a spoonful of comedy.<br />
<br />
Visual wise, Silver Spoon takes on a realistic approach but with rich artistic visuals. The backgrounds is portrayed almost lifelike with a sense of naturalism in terms of its farm animals, buildings, and simplicity. Speaking of simple, most of the characters are designed as such without any fancy outfits, makeups, or battle gear. There is some similarity with its character designs in comparison to Full Metal Alchemist although this should be taken as for granted.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of the series is decent with a simple and straight forward way of presenting its rhythms. The OP song &quot;kiss you&quot; by miwa has a silly way of presenting its song with humorous sequences and character montages. On the other hand, the ED song “Hello Especially” by Sukima Switch has this sense of calmness as we witness characters walking down a road that can be interpreted as walking down a road towards the future. <br />
<br />
Overall, this show might not be for everyone but it certainly should be worth giving a shot. You don’t have to enjoy agriculture to watch this. If you don’t believe me, just ask Hachiken. He started out as the new kid at school but now has earned the respect of not just his classmates but me as well. The realism this series focuses more than just the farm animals but also on Hachiken’s progressive development as his new life begins. It might not be the dream he originally wanted to follow but it sure is something enjoyable to watch. Living a life on the farm might be tough but for me, enjoying this show was simple. <br />

    Everyone views the world in a different colored light. Our shade is affected by our upbringing, our culture, our religion, our language, and a variety of other factors. However, when our color mixes in with another color, then the light in which we view the world in changes dramatically, as yellow mixing with blue makes green. It allows us to see things that we have missed before, and makes us question the things that we&#039;ve always believed. Silver Spoon pushes Hachiken Yugo into a completely new world, and changes the hue of his view as well as ours in this story.<br />

Written by Hiromu Arakawa of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113601">
        Fullmetal Alchemist fame, she writes a story on something that would have been completely overlooked and unappreciated if not for her name, a story about farming, which would have been a complete shame. Based off of her past in growing up on a farm, it is a completely different story from her most famous work, with a completely different tone, but is yet another amazing work. <br />
<br />
The story follows city boy Hachiken Yugo as he enrolls in agricultural school for personal reasons, and his cultural shock and adjustment entering into this completely new world. The story is set in a slice-of-life format, with an almost &quot;plotless&quot; feel to it, just following Hachiken and his friends&#039; life in agriculture, showing things from rounding up chickens to chasing tractors to cooking pizza. Despite seeming like this would be a negative, it actually ends up being a very effective way to present the story, as it gives you a feel for their everyday lives and everything they go through and enjoy. The show also muses on some subtle philosophical aspects that make you sit back and think, and makes it more than just your everyday slice-of-life show. <br />
<br />
The characters are definitely one of the strongest points of this show, and it really helps this show to be an enjoyable and personal one. Hachiken is sort of like an avatar for the viewer, a foreigner looking into this new world. He gets sick when they cut off chicken&#039;s heads, he gets overly attached to farm animals destined to be food, and is bewildered by this completely different way of life. We also slowly start to see throughout the show the growth of his character as he adapts to this new world and starts seeing things in a different light. All the other characters are interesting as well, from the hilarious Tamako to the strong and caring Komaba, it&#039;s always fun to watch their lives and personalities come alive and how they interact with one another. They also have their own dreams they&#039;re chasing and goals they want to reach, and it just makes them more personal than characters who are just there as devices rather than people. <br />
<br />
The art in this show is pretty good, animated well. From what I could tell it was pretty fluid most all the time. The character designs are also pretty clean and weren&#039;t a distraction. One thing I thought the art did really good on though was making the food look delicious, causing your mouth water. Whether it was egg and rice or pizza, somehow it just makes your stomach grumble even though you ate like an hour ago. The music was also pretty good, supplementing the scenes well. The ED fit well with the show too, having the country feel to it. The OP was alright, but in my opinion, it had kind of a subdued feeling to it that I didn&#039;t really like, but that&#039;s just my feeling, it&#039;s still a pretty good OP. The sound and music really help supplement the show&#039;s feeling and dynamic across and fit well.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show was a lot of fun to watch. From the eye-opening views on the farm world to thought-provoking conversations to hilarious moments, this show on farming had my attention in a way I never thought it would. The premise seems strange, but it was a surprisingly enjoyable watch. Despite seeming slow paced like a normal slice-of-life show would, it still felt like the episodes went by in 5 minutes, a testament to how much it absorbs you into its world. While when this first was announced I was only slightly interested, I&#039;m definitely looking forward to when part two comes out in the winter. Give this show a chance; it may not seem like your kind of show, but is definitely a lot greater than it seems.

As an anime I picked up out of a whim I did not expect much, but nonetheless Gin no Saji delivered tenfold. Not only was it a light hearted watch with tasteful comedy given the context, but Gin no Saji really isn&#039;t afraid to explore complex issues which inevitably challenge our perspectives on our morality and allow us to really see what we take for granted. Let&#039;s go into specifics.<br />
<br />
Story (9)<br />
Hiromu Arakawa has created the plot through envisioning the life of the protagonist Hachiken, who takes the initiative to enrol in an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131359">
        Agricultural school in order to be separated from his family. Although at first glance this anime does not seem to have a strong standing plot, though it is through its execution of the story that makes the story exceptional. From the transition from city to country life, it&#039;s obvious that that MC is way out of his comfort zone, but it is from there that he really develops as a person. The pacing of the show really helps with this as it really allows us to see his experiences with his friends and classmates while being able to acknowledge this personal development. The plot left nothing too overly predictable, and as a comedy it really excelled. I think it really was the carefree nature of Gin no Saji while continuously exploring Hachiken&#039;s development which made the anime so entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound (8)<br />
A-1 Pictures has animated Gin no Saji on a solid level. There&#039;s not really too much to say other than the character designs were very well drawn, the backgrounds were clean and the animation as a whole was fluid. The opening theme and ending theme were really catchy as well, and really did reflect the down to earth nature of the anime. The OST was also suffice in reflecting the current situation faced by Hachiken, and I felt that I was better able to empathise with the characters as a result.<br />
<br />
Characters (10)<br />
Definitely the strong point of the anime. Despite focusing on reflecting Hachiken&#039;s development as a person, the producers did not fail to exemplify the efforts of his friends to get him to this point. Through their experiences with the MC, each character is given a great amount of development as well learn about their back stories, motivations and overall, their personalities and how they came to be. Additionally, all the characters are likeable in one way or another, and others really bring out the comedy in this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9)<br />
Gin no Saji was definitely an anime that I really enjoyed, not just because of its down to earth feel and hilarity, but because it wasn&#039;t afraid of exploring issues that other animes probably wouldn&#039;t touch with a 10 foot pole (and in the end they executed it quite brilliantly). By having such diverse characters which drive the story as well as its solid animation and OST, I cannot express how enjoyable I found Gin no Saji to be.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
In the end I believe that a lot of us can really relate to Gin no Saji and the themes it presses forward, despite what initially seems to be your average school anime. I definitely recommend the anime to anybody who wants to take a break from your typical battle anime and wants to watch a light hearted, comedic anime of a teenager&#039;s development as a person when being placed in an unfamiliar situation. Highly recommended!

    Watching the first couple of episodes of Gin no Saji I was very sceptic. I had heard that it was a very good series but I just could not see it. Having powered through the first two episodes I was relieved to discover that it was indeed a very good series. It was very fun and it deviated from the norms of slice of life anime. <br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
The story is pretty much what you would expect from such a series but due to the set up in an agricultural high school there were several minute changes that boosted the series as a whole. Unlike other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181114">
        series it kept being fun and the stories of each episode managed to make the viewing process very fun. The main story was pretty basic but that does not mean that it was boring in any way.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
Artistic wise is what you would expect from a series launched after 2010. The art was very pretty and the scenery complemented the story and characters. It just gave off the feeling that you were actually in a rural part of japan something that it is not seen frequently in anime series (for me it was the first time). Overall I would say that the art was great despite not being flashy. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
Sound was a bit bland. I can not say that any of the ost stuck in my head. Everything was ok but nothing was impressive. I imagine this is the case because the whole series had no epic moments that needed to be boosted by awesome tracks but still I think that it could have been improved.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
All characters were designed exceptionally good. The main character was bit hard to like, at first, but as the series progressed and you get to now more about him you understand why he is the way he is. The supporting characters were all well thought and diverse. As a whole the characters managed to help unfold a pretty funny and enjoyable series filled with hilarious &#039;accidents&#039; but also with deep emotional moments that help the development of the characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
As I have stated above the series was very enjoyable since it deviated from the norms. It is highly recommended to all who wish to watch something uplifting and humorous with that being based on fanservice and slapstick humor.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Overall I would give this series an 8 due to the just fair music and the fact that the season ended very abruptly. Of course there is a season 2 and that may be a little harsh but the fact is that episode 11 (end of season 1) seemed to end in a hurry. Had I been forced to wait for the season 2 to start I would probably not have watched it.

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
While sitting here writing this review, I looked around me to see what food I had lying about. I see some left-over chips, crackers, and a bit of candy. When you think about it, the way certain foods are made is pretty amazing. We can go to the grocery store, pick out pre-sliced meat, and bring it home for dinner to make into hamburgers, steak, or what have you. But how does that meat get from the farm to the freezer? Gin no Saji looks to explore the facets of farming, agriculture, and morality when dealing with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161923">
        very animals we eat, and it does it in a splendid way.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Gin no Saji starts off in a similar fashion to other shows; new student Hachiken has come to Ezonoo in order to start learning about what it means to run a farm.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t get much more simple than that for a description. As such, the show itself is pretty much slice-of-life. Without an over-arcing story, what GnS aims to do is demonstrate the different parts to the farming lifestyle. One of the things that becomes immediately apparent is its factual nature. On top of being pretty unique in its subject matter, the show goes out of its way to explain many different parts to farming. There are explanations of how chickens are handled, the most efficient ways to milk a cow, and insight into gutting a deer. There is way more than I listed, and that&#039;s awesome. The show is not shy about immersing you in this topic that people like me and Hachiken, who come from the city/suburbs, have no knowledge about.<br />
<br />
The show even tackles the idea of morality when it comes to killing and eating animals. What does it mean to love an animal? Is there something wrong with killing and eating living things? The show, like its take on agriculture, explores these questions and more within its contents. I found this type of approach pretty compelling because it got me thinking about the animals that I eat every day. Before, I would have no qualms eating some chicken tenders or scarfing down a nice filet, but after watching Gin no Saji, I will, at the minimum, think twice about what it took for the food in front of me to get there.<br />
<br />
As if the world-building and philosophical ideas weren&#039;t enough, the show also sets its sights on what it means to have a dream. Many people that are asked, &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot; know the answer right away: a doctor, astronaut, computer consultant. For others, they don&#039;t have a choice: maybe they have to take over the family business or are pressured into doing something they don&#039;t necessarily have the heart to do. Yet others still have no answer because they have no idea what they want. The show does a nice job of presenting these three different sides to the previous question. Is there a right or wrong answer? What the show will teach you is no, that the path you follow is the one you should take. In the end, it is up to you to decide what type of person you will become.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Gin no Saji&#039;s art style is rather pleasant. Taking place mostly on farms, the differing locales usually came with differing lifestyles. From pig pens to vegetable fields, the show demonstrates a wide variety of environments that make you feel as if the characters are on the farms they are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The show is produced by A-1 Pictures, so it should come as no surprise that the animation is well done. While the character designs are good, the animal details are of particular note. A-1 Pictures seemed to take extra time in making sure the animals looked realistic. The horses had refined muscles, the cows chewed, and the pigs had beady yet sparkling eyes. The focus of the show is on farming and animals and therefore the quality in them is noticeable and greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Speaking again on character designs, I didn&#039;t find them to be terribly unique but that really isn&#039;t a bad thing. If anything, they all look rather mature for their age. At times, I forgot the show was taking place in high school; the subject material and characters reminded me more of college.<br />
<br />
As a final note, I like Hachiken&#039;s design if only for the glasses. Being a glasses wearer myself, I always appreciate when the MC dons spectacles.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
I guess since GnS is technically listed as a shounen, it has quite a large cast. That being said, there are only two main characters and subsequently they are the most important.<br />
<br />
Starting with the lesser, Mikage is a young woman who loves horses and is one of Hachiken&#039;s first friends at his new school. She is very kind, caring, and more courageous than is initially let on. She actually acts as a foil to Hachiken. She knows what she wants to do deep down in her heart but her hand is forced. In contrast, Hachiken has no idea what he really wants to do but the world is his oyster (gotta&#039; make an animal pun somewhere in here!). Alongside being a literary device, there are definitely feelings that develop within her for Hachiken. While not a romance story in the slightest, the romantic in me loved seeing her reactions to particular situations involving Hachiken.<br />
<br />
The most important character of the series is obviously Hachiken. He&#039;s smart, shy, and determined to prove himself. For him, results mean everything; you&#039;re either a winner or a loser. But his time at Ezonoo, hanging out with friends, helping out Pork Bowl, and making mistakes, helps to flesh him out as a well-rounded character. He starts off stalwart in his thinking but over time he comes to learn that winning isn&#039;t everything, and that its okay to not always know everything.<br />
<br />
After Hachiken and Mikage come the rest of the cast. While nobody distinctly stands out character-wise, they each have their little moments that are used for comedic effect. Special shout out to Nakajima, the equestrian club advisor, for his hilarious Buddha-esque glow behind his head.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OP is okay to my ears. Besides hearing &quot;kiss you&quot; while listening, it is pretty relaxing and matches the overall tone of the show nicely. On the other hand, the ED is pretty good. It really gives off the vibe that they are in the country or on the farm. Likewise, the guitar and the singing complement nicely with one another.<br />
<br />
From the soundtrack, one of the standout pieces is the &quot;stair-step&quot; beat that sounds orchestral. It is hard to describe, but it was used when the characters were looking to get started on a difficult task.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the voice acting is fine. In terms of performances, Ryouhei Kimura does a nice job in the role of Hachiken. Perhaps in the same vein, I found the animal noises to be acceptable as well. Nothing sounded too out of the ordinary, making the animals seem more believable.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Gin no Saji is hard to pin down in terms of genre. It is definitely funny, for starters. The comedy isn&#039;t based off the jokes or the dialogue, but rather what is happening on screen. Whether this is a girl asking for bacon or Beppu throwing dough at a security camera, the comedy comes from the world itself.<br />
<br />
Some of my favorite episodes are definitely the more laid back, slice of life ones. Specifically the pizza and crop circle episodes. I found the former to be a nice tie in with the themes of farming, hard work, and togetherness, while the latter was a fun take on a tired idea.<br />
<br />
I already mentioned this, but being a huge romance buff, seeing Hachiken and Mikage together on screen, either talking with one another or smiling towards each other, always got a smile on my face and my mind wanting them to already end up together.<br />
<br />
Beyond all this, I will say I could easily sympathize with Hachiken. Sometimes you put in a lot of work into something, with the return being negligible. And that can seriously get you down. However, the show goes out of its way to articulate that even when you go through some pretty rough times, there is always going to be some good along the way.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Great, interesting concept with nice world-building and good themes<br />
<br />
Animation: Good, animals are detailed and the environments are fresh<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Hachiken and Mikage complement each other nicely<br />
<br />
Sound: Good, fitting OP and ED, with okay soundtrack<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good, funny, hints of romance, and education<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    Gin no Saji is a pearl hidden deep underneath the all of the 2014 winter animes. I originally read the description of this anime when it first came out, and found it like any other slice of life anime, that will be good but not enough to keep me wanting to watch more. Boy, was I wrong, and thus came to write this review, which is my very first so please be easy on me. Arakawa Hiromu has out done herself again with this award-winning anime. Gin no Saji is definitely an anime you would want to watch when you want to watch a comedic,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156615">
        light-hearted but deep anime.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The plot to this anime is rather simple; boy with family problems, doesn&#039;t know what he wants to do in life, and goes to an agricultural high school to learn more about himself. The plot is simple to follow but truly teaches you about life and food. To city folk, livestock is simply to eat and not to think about any further; where as to country or farm folk, there is so much more to think about when it comes to bringing these animals to the slaughterhouse and making them into daily food. The anime is simple yet deep.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound<br />
<br />
Both the art and sound are simple but nice thus fits extremely well into the simple farm life plot. The art style is distinctly Arakawa Hiromu.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
The characters are all very likable with the exception of maybe only one. Each character have their own type of personality but comes together as one big family, making the anime family friendly and guaranteed for laughter. As viewers, we see our main protagonist, Yugo Hachiken, develop from the new antisocial character to one that becomes much more outspoken and social. We see him interact with all kinds of characters and help them overcome their problems.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Gin no Saji is such a great anime that I sincerely doubt that I will be able to find another slice of life anime on par with this one. I loved watching all the characters including Pork Bowl and Vice Pres, interact, laugh, and argue with each other. I loved learning about the deeper thought process that comes with livestock being born and only a few months later to die for human&#039;s sake. Lastly I loved every moment this anime had to offer. Definitely a 10/10 if you need a simple, hilarious, and deep slice of life anime to watch.

    Silver Spoon<br />
Rating 5(average-low)<br />
(POSSIBLE SPOILERS BEWARE)<br />
<br />
Silver spoon was not that good and In my opinion I didn&#039;t find the first season as interesting. In fact I almost don&#039;t find it as memorable at all i don&#039;t even know all of the characters names for starters (But I guess that is just me). It is just another anime to me.<br />
<br />
The main character is a typical anime type boy cliche,  unrealistically happy like he has never experience  mental pain before, the constant over exaggeration of simple gestures and as always to complete the trend he gets into &quot;sticky situations&quot; (uh-oh). <br />
Yeah and I should mention that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115891">
        he is pretty much the focal point for  most of the humor. At the end of the show it never really answers the question, which was what he did want to become when he was older? (he is in a farm school after all). Instead we got a lack luster response of him accomplishing something which is sort of irrelevant because I still got no answer in terms of the ending. But fear not there is a season 2.<br />
 Also The character development didn&#039;t click with me either, I kind of feel like the creators attempted to make us feel sorry for the main character and his &quot;tough decision&quot; at the end, I didn&#039;t really get it due to the sped up timeline and I didn&#039;t get the point of it (it was kind of silly if you ask me)<br />
<br />
One of the worst parts was the humor, there was too much in the scenes where characters are having a deep 1 on 1 conversation on what they want to do with their lives, how their personality and morals are indicated through their work ethics and in the character development and then something &quot;funny&quot; happens.<br />
 Saying that there was &quot;too much humor&quot; is an exaggeration, but I guess all I wanted was a solid moment with 2 characters.<br />
<br />
I guess you may find all of my other arguments nit-picking type reasons to dislike it but this is the one that annoyed me the most. THE FOCAL POINT FOR ALL POSITIVE EXPERIENCES  REVOLVES AROUND FOOD!! (excluding humor to an extent).<br />
It is annoying that basically everything links up to food. I mean sure they are in a farm school but why is it that hard for you to base the plot around something else, it is a farm school you don&#039;t have to show each and every character eating delicious food in every episode. They even have ongoing jokes about it with this fat girl who almost faints after not eating for a short period of time.<br />
 I wanna see something else happen like someone&#039;s dreams being accomplished or a taste of something like that (haha &quot;taste&quot;, see what I did there).<br />
<br />
Anyway there is a season 2 coming out so I am guess all that stuff about aspirations will be addressed later on!!<br />
Anyway thanks for reading and of course it is my opinion but you may like all of this stuff<br />
<br />

    Ola everybody, as I&#039;ve finished this watching this anime, I&#039;d probably say that this is one of the truly most unique anime for this year, since it doesn&#039;t focus on the usual genre that every anime has followed, so, without further adieu, I present my ratings for each of this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
Story, character, enjoyment- very good 8.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Ok, the story about a city slicker incoming high schooler is very unique in the sense that it presents a strong slice of life that happens in real life, about a boy who escapes from the problems he has with his family only to find himself from the frying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113669">
        pan to the fire kind of thing. However, there is another part of this anime&#039;s slice of life where it shows us that sometimes destiny has a weird way of showing us where we belong.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
So here it&#039;s all about the city slicker guy who has no idea what he got himself into and yes I&#039;m referring to Yugo Hachiken, ok, so at one point I would like to give him a Karate chop on his head for being to cheesy about being in an agricultural high school and getting too emotional about Pork Bowl and other livestock&#039;s around  the said school, but then again one would appreciate as to how much of an asset he is to his fellow classmates, when everyone looks up to him and sees how much his willing to help out and get alone with everyone else......though, there are situations that he&#039;ll grumble and screw-up.<br />
<br />
Aki Mikage, is basically someone who completes the main character, Hachiken as this sweet girls who has served as the latter&#039;s foundation as to keep him in high spirits and, also, I kinda like the Yugo X Aki arc, since those two go nice together.<br />
<br />
 Tamako Inada, I would never understand why she has to be this oversize high schooler who sounded and looks like and sounds like a milf. <br />
<br />
Mayumi Yoshino, if this anime have a harem genre, she would fit in as Aki&#039;s competition for Yugo&#039;s affection.<br />
<br />
Ichiro Komaba, if he&#039;s Yugo&#039;s competition for Aki&#039;s affection, I would prefer that he loses to Yugo.<br />
<br />
And the rest, like Keiji Tokiwa, Shinnosuke Aikawa,Tarou Beppu and Hajime Nishikawa, well, they kinda function well well as the comic relief for this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
It was enjoyable enough and at the same time this anime does provide some insights about farm life, ever thought the farm theme that this anime presents more like resembles a western farm than a Japanese farm. But the enjoyment was really seeing how Hachiken adjust from being a city slicker to a farm boy throughout his stay at Ezo Agricultural High School as an audience there is that urge for me to do something to make him realize about the situation he entered, but as this anime goes on that urge I have was replace by appreciation as to how he gets along with the said situation he entered.<br />
<br />
Art- mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
Since I have no comment about this anime&#039;s illustration, but, it would have been nice if Tamako is this slim high school girl. I&#039;ve also notice another thing about they way the farms were drawn.........the damn illustrator forgot to include rice fields in the damned school or anywhere in Ezo.<br />
<br />
Sound- poor 3.<br />
<br />
I just don&#039;t like both the opening and closing theme, and I really hate that Tamako should sound like a milf than a sweet teen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall- good 7.<br />
<br />
It did presented a very good slice of life genre, the character&#039;s are well presented and it was really enjoyable, however the farm theme that this anime shows is more of a western farm than a typical Japanese farm, and I did said that the damned illustrator forgot to include rice fields. Well, overall, this anime should have an , but I couldn&#039;t ignore the fact that author Taku Kishimoto didn&#039;t combine a kind of agricultural school or a typical place where it should both be a typical western farm combined with Japanese farm. Frankly it was too unfair that such series whether an anime or a manga to not include rice paddies or at least not add a kind of modern Japanese farm into this series. So overall, a 7 would suffice for this anime as a whole, I do hope that in the 2nd season we should be seeing some rice paddies somewhere in  Ezo Agricultural High School and I hope there is a character interested in rice research and production.<br />

    Ever wanted a taste of parenting? Try Usagi Drop. Curious about farming? Silver Spoon&#039;s got you covered. This latest noitaminA feature contains yet another interesting and unique perspective that actually provides meaningful lessons beyond how to immediately get dumped by girls. As with Usagi Drop, the show manages to take a potentially dull and boring topic and turn it into something intriguing and entertaining. While this isn&#039;t as emotionally touching as Usagi Drop, it is still a fun watch for anyone even a bit curious about farming or how a city boy will deal with the culture shock of agricultural life.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The animation studio took a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203203">
        more conventional approach than that in Usagi Drop. For the most part, it looks like any other rural-based anime. The only major differences are the agriculture-specific tools and facilities and a bunch of farm animals. The show uses a fairly saturated palette that gives the series a bit of a lighter mood. Color shading and background details are average overall and character styling is also a bit on the simplistic side. You also have an instructor who humorously resembles Buddha.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t expect much here in terms of either action or fan service. There is a tiny amount of blood once and a while but nothing really significant by action standards.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The show has a fitting guitar-based OP and ED. I&#039;m not a fan of slow, country-ish songs of this sort though so I skipped out on them for the most part. The BGM is minimal and for the most part not really worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
This is in part a documentary and in part a comedy so it is dialogue driven in many parts, but it wasn&#039;t very demanding character emotion-wise and no one ended up really standing out for me.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Hachiken has lived his life in his brother&#039;s shadows, so much so that his entire dreamless life consists of studying. Having no real drive or future plans, his teacher sends him to a live-in agrarian high school. To his amazement, Hachiken finds himself surrounded by people with strong goals and dreams. Will Hachiken be able to cope with his new, culturally-different classmates and five AM practicums?<br />
<br />
This is an eye-opener of a series in many regards. In telling Hachiken&#039;s tale of learning about agriculture, the show is able to expose and confront a lot of misnomers about agriculture and even address some philosophical questions regarding livestock&#039;s transformation from respected living creature to meat. Between these conception-shattering moments, you get a bit of character development and a good deal of comic moments; a lot of these revolve around Hachiken&#039;s ignorance of the field that he&#039;s studying.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t the most intense of series plot wise. Don&#039;t expect much in the way of cliffhangers or rising action, in fact the series doesn&#039;t even really end on much of a conclusion. I guess this fact is slightly mitigated by the fact that a second season has already been announced.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
There are a lot of characters in this show, and while a lot of them contribute to the central plot in one way or another no one is really well developed. The focus of the show is clearly more on showing farming procedures and practices than on giving the, admittedly, bland history of farm hands. While the protagonist clearly becomes much more adept at manual labor, he still maintains a significantly different world view than that of his classmates at the end of the show. The show does occasionally tease at possible character relationships but this is used as more of a comedy gimmick than for plot progression. Overall, the show features a balanced cast that really is presented to highlight the core farming theme rather than the other way around.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
My strongest takeaway from this show (at least to confirm) is that farm-fresh foods appear to be highly superior to what I, as a cheapskate consumer, can get from the local grocery store. Expect to see the protagonist literally prostrate as a reaction to tasting food. Overall, despite being an average show plot wise, the show managed to stick to its unique theme; this alone earns it a lot of kudos. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t see it becoming a hit like Usagi Drop, it just lacks the emotional and character depth. Regardless, it still stands on its own as a reasonably entertaining look at how life is as a farmer. While I have new found respect for those in agribusiness, I&#039;ll stick to my white-collar line of work thank you very much. If you&#039;re willing to ditch established anime norms (required beach scene, unreasonably cute girls everywhere, etc.) and watch something that can teach you a thing or two, give Silver Spoon a go.

    Mainstream anime is so predictable, the mere thought of watching one revolts me. Plots are used over and over again, characters are portrayed by the same well-known voices who&#039;s lack of emotion is really starting to piss me off, and worst of all, the use of below-average OPs and EDs make majority of mainstream anime a very bad batch of brew... much rather like Budweiser. <br />
<br />
Gin no Saji however, isn&#039;t a bottle of Budweiser... it&#039;s a bottle of 30 year old scotch. So now, please allow me to explain the differences to you non-drinkers. <br />
<br />
Budweiser.. bitter to drink, flavourless after a few sips, and would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review116973">
        take just below 10 gallons to get you tipsy. All in all, a useless piece of garbage designed for those with a unusable tongue, and a lack of tolerance to alcohol. Mainstream anime (such as the dreadful &#039;Campione!&#039; or &#039;Shining Hearts&#039;) are the same; lacking heavily in substance, and relying on the fact that most otaku would want to watch some semi-naked girls chasing a guy round some poorly sketched field. Sometimes I feel sorry for the actors who have to read the boring script, I mean, even a Shakespearean play is more interesting! But I don&#039;t blame the producers. The anime industry is full of competition, and sticking with a fool-proof plot is guaranteed to get at least some figures for them to publish.. what I do blame, however, are the idiots who watch mainstream anime in the first place. Without these pea-brained pussies, we would&#039;ve ridded the world of hindrance so vile, even a thousand year old cheese would lose the competition. But since we&#039;re stuck with them, we&#039;ve gotta feed them right? So, just like Budweiser, mainstream anime is fed to people without 1) any taste whatsoever. 2) any dignity as a human being.<br />
<br />
So, what about the scotch then, who are we going to compare this to? The answer is simple; you and I. Gin no Saji is NOT a mainstream anime. Its&#039; plot is NOT predictable. It&#039;s NOT introduced by some silly &#039;la la la&#039; j-pop crap, neither is it ended with &#039;lo lo lo&#039; rubbish. It is everything that is NOT Budweiser. The plot may seem simple at first, and you might think you know where it&#039;s going to lead to.. like the first sip of a beautiful scotch. But as soon as you swallow the scotch, you feel it. The vibrance, the tanginess, the smokiness, and the mellow finish that brings a hint of woodiness to the taste buds. Ah, blissful. But afterwards, you feel the bitterness of the alcohol protruding your senses. You feel the alcohol burning into the back of your throat. And you&#039;re certainly going to feel the fire in your chest, accompanied by the blitz to your head. <br />
<br />
Yes, Gin no Saji is the same as a good scotch. It certainly led me to a happy place (not that one you disgusting person). It made me think about the meaning of life.. and that&#039;s what all anime should do imo, make you think. Engaging the content is far more important than watching it, much rather like sex. The plot was structured simply, mainstream if I dare say, yet with the little details dotted all over the place, it made the anime unique. Like a mountain road, it twists with the bends, and it rise with the bumps. The overall atmosphere was a mellow-upper, comparable to a beautiful piece of tarmac road.. but the grim reminder of death loomed over each corner. The most amazing thing about this anime is, in my opinion, is its ability to bring you back to a mellow-upper state immediately after the downer! Just the roller coaster of emotions is enough for you to WANT to watch the piece. <br />
<br />
Ah, I can write no more.. Pork Bowl, you were so cute. Perhaps it&#039;s wrong of me to say this... but I love you :&#039;)<br />
<br />
And so concludes another piece of my (not) interesting, yet (un)informative review. If you&#039;ve read to the end, well done. If you haven&#039;t, then you won&#039;t see this; but you, my friend, is a massive dick head who&#039;s sole existence is a crime against humanity lol. Peace out.

    Ah, one of the most hyped anime of the season. Why? Not only is it adapted from a commercially successful, award winning &amp; critically acclaimed manga but also it is written by the famous mangaka Hiromu Arakawa who is responsible for the world famous FMA. So how was the anime? Does it live up to the hype? And how can a manga based on life on agricultural school be this famous? And most of all how come a mangaka who wrote such an action based title as FMA write this? Let me just say that whatever else this anime does it proves (or tries to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114341">
        actually) that you can be a person who doesn&#039;t have a clear goal in life or any vague idea what you are gonna do with your life even if are surrounded by ambitious people and it is not always bad; and most of all it proves that book-worm nerds can be cool even when they are acting all moronic &amp; stuff.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story of this anime centers around Yugo Hachiken whose dream in life is quite simple (although it seemed a bit weird at the first few episodes). It is to be separated from his family, so he enrolls in an agricultural boarding school which would take him quite far from his house till he gets his own job. As he deems himself to be an excellent crammer, he believes he will have no problem in there. But it turns out the life there is not what he expected as he gets in the world where physical labor is more important than his brains &amp; the cruelty of the harsh reality of the life of the livestock. He eventually finds friends among his classmates who are all farmers&#039; heirs &amp; not a total city boy like him. And thus the story of his new life goes on with everyday learning of the lifestyle of farmers as well as their farm animals, which quite often arises very funny situation, and thankfully the comedy almost never felt forced.<br />
Although it may seem very unusual for the premise of an anime, even for a slice-of-life but all the plot elements are gelled together quite nicely by the writer &amp; the episodic nature of the story (at the first half mainly) really goes well with the premise of the show. Although at first the reason of Hachiken wanting to leave his home that desperately was a bit hard to understand, in later episodes it is explained quite clearly. As the various animals in the school grows through the passing of the time in his school so does his understanding (as well as ours) of farm-life grows, and he has to face some facts of reality which is harsh but true. The show mainly focuses on how he overcomes them and even helps his friends in their needs.<br />
The story certainly gets props for originality and although at times a bit boring with the knowledge bits but definitely was enjoyable for me, so it gets 8.5 out of 10. <br />
<br />
Characters <br />
Although many might disagree with me on this but there is actually only one main character in this anime, rest are just side characters. Hachiken is a character who is like the anime, a bit slow to develop, it takes a viewers a bit of time ( a few episodes at least) to relate with him &amp; to understand his motivations, to appreciate his viewpoints. At first you might find him a bit one-dimensional as someone who takes the easy way out,who runs away from his family but if you carry on with him on his journey you will find out his reasons, will find out how he actually is quite caring for his friends through his actions &amp; tries to help in them in their problems while sometimes even completely ignoring his own ones. And in the end he is a likeable character as well as quite unique too.<br />
As for the other characters they are very likeable too. Mikage who is the love interest for our protagonist seems a bit bland at first but Hiromu later develops her quite brilliantly in her unique way. The other important characters include hardworking &amp; ambitious Komaba (somewhat generic for the source of Hachiken&#039;s jealousy but has a well written back-story); whimsical &amp; laughably dumb at math Tokiwa; money lover &amp; aggressive eater frightening Tamako; afraid of blood yet vet wanna be Shinnosuke ( whose struggles to face his fears is portrayed quite nicely); Hachiken&#039;s irritable yet funny brother (who is following his dream by the way) Shingo among others.<br />
The characters are actually the strongest aspect of this anime &amp; pulls through all the rest of the stuff to a very enjoyable height indeed.<br />
So I give it 9 out of 10.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation<br />
To be honest the character designs &amp; the art is not at the same level of the rest of the stuff for this anime. The faces of the characters quite often seem too similar &amp; there is a lack of general detail in them. All the food-stuff at least looked good. The animation also seems bland in this day of top-notch technology and somewhat awkward in occasions. But at least on the positive side there is a sense of consistency in animation of the show as a whole, unlike few other animes these days &amp; the piglets were cute.<br />
However, it is not as per with other things of the anime &amp; gets 7 out of 10. <br />
<br />
Sound  <br />
The opening theme is &quot;Kiss You&quot; by Miwa which is a nice song and appropriate for the show but actually not that special. The ending theme is &quot;Hello Especially&quot; by Sukima Switch which is the perfect ending song for the show for me, it has kind of a country vibe going for it which is suitable for the atmosphere of the show. Other pieces used during the show are all alright but nothing really stands out as anything special.<br />
As a whole sound gets from me 8 out 10. <br />
<br />
There is a lot of argument going on the internet whether this is the best show of this season or not, and with a second season now confirmed it is even more fueled. All I can say on these regard is while this anime may not be for everyone (Slice-of-life rarely is), still it is definitely one of the shows to watch for this season; this is kind of a casual &amp; thinking mans show. The funny bits &amp; the thought-provoking realistic situations the characters are put into often are really the highlights and was enough enjoyable for me so that I for one will pick up the second season, I might even try out the fan translated manga too.<br />
<br />
Overall Score - <br />
                           8.5 out of 10.<br />
<br />

    This review considers both seasons to be one entity.<br />
<br />
If any anime has ever been able to evoke feeling of pure joy, it&#039;s this one. This isn&#039;t the prettiest anime, nor does it feature the most original story, nor does it have the most complex characters. But it is hands down one of the most easygoing, pleasant, and enjoyable anime I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
The first thing I want to note is how much I adore the show&#039;s aesthetics. The food is of course, a focal point of the show, and A-1 Pictures managed to make it look damn tasty, as they needed to do in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192456">
        show about agricultue. I love Hiromu Arakawa&#039;s style and the character designer really nailed the way everyone looked. Which is surprising considering A-1 produced this. Their style is generally so typical and bland to me. It just makes me appreciate Gin no Saji more. However, the animation won&#039;t make your jaw drop through the floor like ufotable or Shaft can do, but the show isn&#039;t about heavy action or surrealism. The animation did what it needed to do to serve the purposes of the show, and it did it well. However, there are some cringey CGI bits that I didn&#039;t like.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, I just need to gush about the ED for a moment. It&#039;s so good and it&#039;s catchy as hell. The song perfectly fits the cheerful tone of the show and it forms an excellent bridge between the ending of an episode and the credits. The OP, while it isn&#039;t as good as the ED, is still adorable, catchy, and very cheerful. Beyond the OP and ED, though, I don&#039;t really remember much about the soundtrack at all to be honest. It did it it&#039;s job, I suppose. It wasn&#039;t exactly memorable. However, the animal sound effects are good, as they should be. No problems here, but the soundtrack of the anime is it&#039;s weakest point.<br />
<br />
The story is rather simple, a boy, a studious and urban child, attends a rural agricultural high school. Little does he realize, he&#039;s in way over his head. Hijinks ensue. But the point of Gin no Saji isn&#039;t to tell an astounding story, it&#039;s about the lessons we learn alongside Hachiken. He learns about the brutal realities of farm life for the livestock and the farmers. He learns about responsibility. He even learns a little but about love. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s through these lessons that Gin no Saji shows itself to be a very special anime. Personally, I find Hachiken to be very relatable. I wasn&#039;t good for much other than memorizing facts and doing tests in school either. I don&#039;t know anything about working on a farm or taking care of animals or growing crops. For me, it was like I was right there beside Hachiken, learning about the world and agriculture with him. That is exactly what makes Hachiken such an effective protagonist. A good story, but not all, requires an ignorant character through which the audience can learn more about the world the story presents. It&#039;s immersive and informative. The rest of the cast is entertaining. None of the secondary characters were grating or annoying to me. Not all of the characters are explored in that great of depth, but we do gain significant insight into their lives. Ichiro&#039;s character probably had the most interesting development of the other characters, but I don&#039;t want to spoil too much. I&#039;ll just say I loved the characters. Hachiken Yuugo is an excellent protagonist, and he is one of my favorites in all anime.<br />
<br />
Does it present an accurate interpretation of farm life? I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m just a city boy. But I&#039;ve heard that lots of what the anime shows us is very accurate. Hiromu Arakawa was raised on a dairy farm after all, and we follow characters in the dairy sciences program. I&#039;m inclined to say, yes, this story presents entirely plausible and realistic situations.<br />
<br />
As I stated before, I enjoyed this anime immensely. It&#039;s some of the best fun I&#039;ve had watching anything. It&#039;s also very touching at times, and even a little sad. It&#039;s a story about growing up. It&#039;s a story about living life. Life is gonna have its ups and downs and it&#039;ll be a confusing, tiring, exciting ride. Gin no Saji conveys such a powerful sense of being alive (it&#039;s difficult to put into words). I don&#039;t know, I loved every second of this anime. I think it&#039;s a masterpiece of the slice of life genre and it&#039;s one of the best anime I&#039;ve ever seen.

    &quot; There are things that you only can learn by experiencing it! &quot;<br />
<br />
Silver Spoon, is an agriculture-themed slice of life anime that explores the attachment with livestocks that are usually presented to us in a plate. It put us and the main protagonist in a new perspective of experiencing the cruelty happening inside the slaughterhouse, the fate of livestocks and the burden that some holds.<br />
<br />
Coloring the story, is the playful and silly interaction of the main protagonist with his eccentric friends in the school&#039;s dorm. He is forced to interact, to take action to do things that he wanted to but subconsciously denies, and to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323307">
        take that regret that he&#039;s been immersing himself in to truly enjoy once-in-a-life-time moments. It&#039;s a story about taking chances to learn, smile and feel sense of belongings, lost.<br />
<br />
Romance is a sub-plot while comedy focuses on the exaggeration of trivial things and predictable jokes, which is one of the element that creates a warm and friendly atmosphere exhibited by them. It feels like something we&#039;ve seen or experienced ourselves before, and it&#039;s presented again before our eyes. Adding the cheerful soundtrack and blending with sad piano sound, it gives different scenes extra feels. <br />
<br />
Overall, Silver Spoon is a great change in pace with some inspiring lessons that we might have forgotten. It is enveloped in both sweet and relaxing ambience, one that would give you a bit of goosebumps and nostalgia.<br />
<br />
<br />
P/S: I&#039;d highly recommend Barakamon and Natsume Yuujinchou if you&#039;re wildly in love with the theme this presents. They are all breathtaking, as in metaphorical term because of the vibe it gives and in literal, for the countryside setting.<br />

    Gin no Saji&#039;s strength is that it&#039;s a &#039;high school&#039; anime that&#039;s almost wholly original. By taking place in an agricultural school, it abandons most of the run-of-the-mill high school storylines. The main character flees his home to this farflung school for reasons that are only vaguely outlined during the show. The secondary characters are amusing, but have limited depth to them, and his love interest is almost one-dimensional. As such, this show is not really character-driven. It&#039;s about the novel new burdens of life that the protagonist has to accept at this school. If anything, the protagonist&#039;s increased understanding and respect for the food

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125535">
        chain becomes the main focus of the show; his own personal development doesn&#039;t seem to go anywhere. <br />
Gin no Saji is different enough from other high-school series to warrant a viewing, but it doesn&#039;t excel in any specific respect. It is mildly amusing and just interesting enough to keep you going from one episode to the next.

    Considering the fact that it&#039;s way more refreshing when this series doesn&#039;t fall to  any &quot;Iyashikei&quot; type of shows.. Honestly it&#039;s more than that.<br />
<br />
Silver Spoon is on par with Mushishi and Natsume on its’ feel good. Gin no Saji is the equivalence of a breeze in the summer. You watch it, enjoy it and you forget about it. It is a modest attempt on equating the reason for killing animals in exchange for tasting that delicious. Hachiken is a sympathetic character whose childhood of holding back his compassion made him unable to deny anyones’ call for help. He loves the animal, especially Pork Bowl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255858">
        but instead of simply delaying/extending his life, Hachiken embraces it. Because life ends, but life goes on. What was the point of rearing the animals, should they only be meant to be used, discarded and eaten. The horses devote their entire effort, but only result is of key. Even after that, once they fail, they are churned into meat. The pigs, cows, chicken, each just playing their role until a moments’ mistake/injury deem their life unworthy, only to be sent to the butcher by the end of the day. This show is the extent of that reasoning. We just gotta enjoy it while it lasts. That is the fate of all the farm animals, and so is it for us. Embrace and enjoy your life, cos’ it ain’t very long to begin with. <br />
<br />
Brilliant anime all the way to the end…<br />
Hits you perfectly with the points, and knows exactly what it’s all about, really no flaws visually, manages to keep the narrative informative, close to the plot points and the reason for the anime, with no unnecessary additional contexts.<br />

    If you thought this would be just a boring, agricultural slice of life anime, you&#039;re wrong. <br />
<br />
The first time that I watched it, I had to postpone watching halfway through episode 1 because I was not interested. I only checked it out because I heard that Hiromu Arakawa, the creator of Full Metal Alchemist created it. Due to the lack of good anime series to watch, I decided to watch all episodes. Unknowingly, this series provided entertainment and the humor is unique and entertaining. I thought that it all comes down to that, but there&#039;s more. The characterization is outstanding and you can see well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208325">
        the character development throughout the series. In this anime, you get to watch the characters work hard for their dreams, not a bunch of boobs and pantyshots. I related to the main protagonist Hachiken&#039;s situation and problem, for my parents often criticized my grades, flaws, and inability to do something. <br />
<br />
Overall, this series is a masterpiece. Hiromu Arakawa never failed me.<br />

    Born and raised in the countryside I was immediately curious when I read the synopsis of Gin no Saji. I haven’t read the manga and I didn’t expect too much from this, but with these low expectations I was pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
The story of Gin no Saji evolves around Hachiken Yugo, a city boy who flees from his family to an agricultural school far away from the city. With his intellect and his talent in studying attending this school seems to be no problem for him, but he’s proven wrong very quickly. From collecting eggs to raising a piglet until it’s being sent off to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114099">
        slaughterhouse; we follow Hachiken’s struggle when he finds the truth of the harsh world of farming and searching for his goal, when all his new friends (mostly farmer’s heirs) already have their own.<br />
<br />
The art in this show was pretty good and detailed. The food showed here makes you hungry just looking at it. The character designs were nice, with unique and funny appearances, and the animation seemed to go smoothly as well. I didn’t like the opening that much, but the overall soundtrack was good and the ending theme gives off this country feel, what makes it really fitting for this show.<br />
<br />
The strength of Gin no Saji are the characters. Hachiken enters the school as an inexperienced, shy boy who knows nothing about farming, but struggles bravely with the challenges he gets thrown at him. We see him get sick when the head of a chicken gets chopped off and he gets overly attached to animals which are supposed to become food. We can all relate to at least some of his experiences. As the series continues, we see Hachiken’s character grow. All other characters are interesting as well and often funny, but never too unnatural what makes them look like real people with dreams and goals.<br />
<br />
Sitting back in my chair or lying in bed, I enjoyed every episode of Gin no Saji. The show is easy to follow with subtle psychological themes like seeing cute little animals become your food, and the question whether you should eat it or not. But along with a bunch of hilarious scenes it was a light, heartwarming and very entertaining anime.<br />
<br />
The second season of Gin no Saji will be airing this Winter season and I’m already looking forward to it! Since it’s my first review, I’m still a bit unsure about how to write them, but I hope you liked it nevertheless!
