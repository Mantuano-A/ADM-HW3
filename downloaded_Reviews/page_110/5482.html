    Unyaaa!!<br />
<br />
For those that don&#039;t know what that means, it&#039;s apparently cute cat talk and reference to 2010&#039;s summer anime Asobi ni Iku Yo. An anime purely dedicated to fan-service enthusiasts who love eye-candy.<br />
<br />
With an abundance of cliché anime that provide service in the market, it&#039;s pretty hard for people to differentiate whether it&#039;s worth watching or passing up(due to having seen its type before.) Whilst I&#039;d normally say the latter for Asobi, I&#039;d be lying if I did as it had definitely caught my attention within the first 2 or so episodes. Asobi is an anime that amalgamates everything a fanboy loves and adds a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29704">
        story for which the most part, does leave you wanting to see what happens next. If only it had kept it&#039;s pacing and consistencies to the very end, I might have had better regards for its rating.<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
Asobi ni Iku Yo is a tale of how an ordinary boy meets an extraordinary alien cat-girl(nekomimi shoujo). Clichéd? Definitely. So what makes Asobi any better then the rest of what&#039;s out there? Simple. Add in a gun wielding childhood friend, an introvert spectacle-wearing classmate with special powers, a teacher belonging to an underground UFO cult, an uncle who seems to be more then he is, a cat worshiping ojou-sama, and an alien dog-woman as the main antagonist and we have a formulated cast that could either make or break the show...<br />
<br />
 The disadvantage to this though, is the introduction of too many characters that you could easily like, and not leaving much in regards to background.<br />
<br />
Art - 6<br />
As an anime dedicated to fan-service, it was in no doubt that ecchi would play a part in the series. As a hot-blooded male I see nothing wrong with that and considering its targeted audience are probably lonely boys who get off on the harem setting, the series has done well in the visual department as it didn&#039;t cater for just one fan of ecchi either. Whilst most guys will agree that bigger breast is best, we cannot out rule that there are a certain few who&#039;s preference are palm-sized or have none at all. Asobi provides this.<br />
<br />
Watching the series in an upscaled HD format, artwork was passable as it&#039;s not mediocre yet I wouldn&#039;t class it as a masterpiece either. Everything is drawn well and animation is fluid throughout the series, which I believe should be a standard norm for any anime being produced as of 2010. Hence my rating of 6.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6<br />
Like its art, OP and ED are not groundbreaking, and at best suits its uplifting theme throughout the series. With Sphere playing their catchy J-pop tune &quot;Now loading... SKY!!&quot; on opening credits, one could feel that this is your average type harem or romance/comedy as it&#039;s a beat that unconsciously invites fandom into the series. One thing worth mentioning though is the series choice of seiyuu(voice actor). As a fan of Haruka Tomatsu(Rouge from Basquash, the twins from Nyan Koi! and Aoba of Cross Game just to name a few), they have decided to use her talents as the mains childhood friend in a tsundere type role. Now this may be another chance for the director to show more service and if it was, then it&#039;s pure win as Haruka is the type of seiyuu I prefer playing a tsundere-type lead over others in the market(eg. Rie Kugimiya).<br />
<br />
Characters - 6<br />
Whilst each character on their own may seem cliché and lackluster, it&#039;s the culmination of having them brought together that I guess makes this anime work. As clichés go, we have your main Kio who is the center of the story. An uninspiring lead who nose-bleeds easily, but I really can&#039;t fault him as he does fall in your classic harem archetype of being the weak/shy boy who will stand up to anything regardless of fortitude. If only he wasn&#039;t as clueless, I might have liked this anime even more. Then we have his harem, Eris(alien cat-girl), Manami(childhood friend) and Aoi(school friend with mysterious powers). Whilst each heroine falls under their own archetype also, they do have redeeming qualities that can out rule you from rolling your eyes each time they go into cliché-mode. There are others worth mentioning, but I won&#039;t so not to spoil it for you, and my only advice in this area is to take each character introduced lightly as this anime pokes fun and may even parody certain archetypes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; OverAll - 5<br />
Unfortunately what started out as an anime with a lot of promise, due to the series being short and certain inconsistencies, it had left some questions unanswered and felt rushed at the end giving us a mediocre conclusion. There are a lot of flaws to this series from becoming a &quot;cut-above-the-rest&quot; type harem, but for an anime that runs at 12 episodes, I guess it&#039;s a lot better then some out there I could list out. Whilst the series may not be aiming for top spot in MAL or any other anime review site, what it does aim for is to give viewers 20+ minutes of mindless entertainment per episode, and give lonely boys out there some false hope that it may happen to them.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t mind service, then this anime is worth the laughs and amusement. <br />
<br />
UNYAAA!!

    Warning this review may contain spoilers.  It&#039;s the first review I&#039;ve ever written for this site; therefore you notice it isn&#039;t &#039;quite&#039; in the site&#039;s unofficial format.  Which as far as I can tell is almost a checklist of the top five scores and their final overall.<br />
<br />
Asobi ni Iku yo!<br />
<br />
Surprisingly; good story.  It&#039;s a short story format; only three &#039;arcs&#039; maybe four.  All interconnected and they all had a point.  They constantly fore-shadowed things that would appear in later episodes.<br />
<br />
The echii/harem side of things...  Was almost sidelined by the gun-fire and explosions.  It&#039;s a fairly straight up action/adventure/sci-fi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30838">
        show with quite a few parodies and references.<br />
<br />
The &#039;bounce&#039; factor was &#039;almost&#039; down-played.  First three episodes they stared; after that Eris&#039;s mighty bust is constantly present but hardly an active focus.<br />
<br />
It&#039;&#039;s a very soft &#039;melo melo&#039; &#039;pure love&#039; sort of echii; they even make reference to this in the op.  They kissed...  Once.  Occasionally there was an accidental infringement scene; especially in the first half.  They ended up in swim suits twice; in one case pantsu was involved due to a tail hole.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry; this was far less echii then I expected from all the descriptions and feed back.  The story wasn&#039;t focused on it; it existed but as a back drop for the actual story.  <br />
<br />
The lead...  Is Too Dense To Take Seriously.  He also isn&#039;t unlucky enough to be considered a plot trigger.  I can&#039;t even remember his name despite it being used dozens on dozens of times.  He could have been anyone in that situation; I firmly believe that his only reason for being in the anime was to be the viewers &#039;avatar&#039;.  His personality is a blank non-descriptive hole.<br />
<br />
For that very reason I&#039;m grateful; for there are moments, songs, and various scenes which where the anime rose far above the general harem feel.  Tora-dora had more sexual tension...  Seriously.  The echi is existant, it is a small part of; however it is not the entirety of this anime...  Not by a long shot.<br />
<br />
Be it the lonely spaceman, the various parodies, music, political reactions, and ect.  There was far more to this show then just echi, oppai, and the harem way.<br />
<br />
To lost adventurers, crazy cults, moon gazing, robot independence, political conspiracy, and parodies without end.  Kampai!<br />
<br />
I gave this show an 8.  For excellent action, some particularly stirring pieces of sound/music, a solid story line, average voice actors, so-so echii, and because on occasion...  Rare occasion.  Amidst those short twelve episodes...  I found a scene that could touch my soul.<br />
<br />
I expected the occasional grin, a guffaw, to stare in awe of the bounce.  I didn&#039;t expect to find serious messages buried amidst the comedy.<br />
<br />
You can&#039;t take this show seriously; it&#039;s a light watch.  However if you can enjoy the genre; then don&#039;t hesitate to watch it just because of a few negative comments.  There are some things in this short little gem that are well worth checking out.<br />
<br />
They are hidden and often to the point; much like any good comedians...  There are dark/terrible truths buried beneath the humor.

    ~!~ WARNING: Spoilers ~!~<br />
<br />
Jeez...I kinda wish I didn&#039;t even watch this anime to begin with. Maybe I&#039;m just being harsh, but there wasn&#039;t something great about this. It was such a let-down. Something really promising at first and very quickly dropped as soon as you start.<br />
<br />
~ Story 2/10 ~<br />
I might be missing some accuracy because of the story being boring and unappealing so forgive me.<br />
The main character is Kio Kakazu, an easy-going teen who seems to accept his new reality quite easy as his new friend is an alien cat girl, his childhood friend is a special agent, and his other friend is also a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97201">
        special agent as well. Essentially, this kid becomes pulled into a terrible situation by being involved with alien cat girls who came down to earth because...of the fish? While his friends work for the government as professional agents who are armed from head to toe.<br />
The story is quite ridiculous and almost stupid. It&#039;s not even really in a funny way. It ruins itself from this style. Sure, it could have been quirky and an interesting to watch if it didn&#039;t fail to live up to what it could have been.<br />
The very first episode is interesting as you watch an awesome fight scene. You find yourself clapping at the animation, even though it&#039;s awkward sometimes, and fight scenes. Something seems odd about it but you feel like this anime will be action packed and detailed.<br />
Watching Asobi ni Iku yo is like having this amazing business man come to your door and offering you on an adventure that could save the universe. However, as soon as you accept his request and go to shake is robust, muscular hand, he turns into a wacky and cartoony clown that says &quot;Just kidding&quot; and slaps his genitals in your face before riding off into the sky on his own ass.<br />
After this fight scene, you see our &quot;hero&quot; teen of the story who meets the first cat girl, Eris. Right after that, everything goes down hill.<br />
Reasons for why aliens are present on the earth seems silly to the point that you&#039;ll find yourself face palming why they take such huge and crucial parts of the story and dismiss them with simple reasons or childish remarks as if it&#039;s nothing. The episodes don&#039;t even seem to go anywhere or develop. If you even found ONE silver lining in the story, you will be crushed dearly by the ending.<br />
I tried to take in atleast the romance factor of the anime. It&#039;s all like a harem, but maybe the anime will come through with a love complex between the two main characters, right?<br />
No.<br />
You will find the solution to the complicated love triangle and who out of the handful of girls that love this guy gets to be with them. The solution at the end? Well, why don&#039;t they just all marry him? It&#039;s not illegal atleast by cat alien standards.<br />
There is honestly no story. You could watch this and not even pay attention to the details and it would pretty much be the same thing. The only thing that seems to be story is the girls getting into ridiculous situations involving them to dress slutty or find some way to show off fan service.  If you went into the anime without expecting anything at all, you&#039;ll be fine. If you want a cool sci-fi about neko girls and a pleasant romance, you might want to turn around.<br />
and run far away and never come back unless you are really bored.<br />
<br />
~ Art 9/10 ~<br />
Honestly the only thing I seemed to enjoy was the art of this anime. The animation is very fluid although awkwardly clunky sometimes. The style they chose is quite lovely. The atmosphere is displayed so well as the scenes change from beaches to seas, mornings to afternoons, neighborhoods to malls, etc...<br />
All are greatly detailed and vibrant. It&#039;s colorful and enjoyable. Characters are nicely designed along with it&#039;s beautiful scenes and color. It&#039;s as if someone put lots of love and care into this factor, and I almost feel really bad for the artist for the fact that he wasn&#039;t complimented by the music, writers, or really anyone. If there was anyone who was truly serious about this product, it was the artist.<br />
<br />
~ Sound 7/10 ~<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say about the soundtrack. There really isn&#039;t anything special about it. The music isn&#039;t bad but it isn&#039;t memorable either. It&#039;s basic and meets the standards but that&#039;s all. However, it was nice from time to time. It was a decent soundtrack that was even very fitting sometimes. Voice actors were also skilled. If their scripts were better, I would&#039;ve been more impressed by them. Although, it seems they were working with limited material and didn&#039;t even seem to take it seriously sometimes.<br />
<br />
~ Characters 4/10 ~<br />
Cardboard cut-outs and and big boobs. That&#039;s it.<br />
The only thing flat in this show is the characters. But atleast their chests aren&#039;t.<br />
The female characters are basic and stereotypical or sometimes have no personality besides boobs. Other characters are interesting. However, there isn&#039;t anyone too special or unique. You&#039;d find that sometimes, the robot characters that don&#039;t even talk have more personality than the characters who talk.<br />
It isn&#039;t dreadful as the dialogue isn&#039;t atrocious and the personalities do have some shape. Overall, though, it&#039;s not much and your characters are mostly there because they are important to the &quot;story&quot; or they are just sex appeal.<br />

~ Enjoyment 4/10 ~<br />
There isn&#039;t much to enjoy from this anime. What could be good and have excellent potential seem to be held back. The fight scenes would seem serious and well detailed while intense. At the same time, no one is murdered and you&#039;ll find enemies taken down easily by cutesy cliche&#039; magical girl styles.<br />
Tons of tanks and helicopters and soldiers arrive and they are disarmed by a girl with a hammer, the vehicles disappearing and the soldiers naked and defenseless. The action is so held back. It seems like they want to be serious but can&#039;t be.<br />
One moment you&#039;ll have soldiers, and then have toy robot cat drones firing lasers and destroying matter to enter a boat. Whatever happens in the anime, there isn&#039;t an explanation. If it happened, that&#039;s all there is to it. Any questions will go unanswered unless it&#039;s unimportant. Nothing besides the art draws you in and so many things are a let-down. The romance is poor, the action had potential, the characters are poor, and the story is the biggest disappoint. Not even the ending was enjoyable. It&#039;s as if nothing happens through the entire thing even though so many things transpire. Why? WHY?!<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Everything besides the art was lacking greatly. Nothing drew you in. Nothing satisfied you. If you go in with expectations, you leave disappointed unless you only like fan service. Nothing seems to happen really. You can watch the first few episodes and the last episode and it would almost be the same as watching the entire thing.<br />
There isn&#039;t much to watch besides fan service and art. Maybe you could pull out something from this. If you like something funny and sexy scenes, maybe this anime is for you. Who knows, it might be your tastes. Anything else....well you will surely be disappointed.

    I saw this anime was ecchi and gave it a try, the story is average, there&#039;s no complexity about it but that&#039;s not the most important while watching ecchi anime anyway, in a way the story is kinda interesting and is a good ecchi if you&#039;re looking just for &#039;&#039;ecchiness&#039;&#039;, it has decent comedy, good characters and the assistroids were entertaining.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is simple, a Catgirl named Eris is sent to the earth from the planet Catnia to investigate the earth&#039;s culture, she stumbles with Kakazu&#039;s uncle and he takes her home because she&#039;s a cat not because he&#039;s creepy, meanwhile there&#039;s commotion from certain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195242">
        secret groups of who is going to take Eris, and because these organizations keep creating incidents to take her, the Catnia gals make Kakazu&#039;s house the first and new Embassy of Catnia on the planet, there was a race of dogs that came before them to earth and mantained themselves in secret, until a dog girl from Dognia wanted to kick out the &#039;&#039;Catnians&#039;&#039; from earth and wants to destroy Catnia and &#039;&#039;Dognians&#039;&#039; will start some conflicts against the &#039;&#039;Catnians&#039;&#039; because Dogs hate Cats. Story is weird but fine because of that juicy uncensored &#039;&#039;plot&#039;&#039;.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The animation is very good, the ecchi parts were visually pleasant, it was well made, nothing much to say other than censor-kun doesn&#039;t appear in this anime.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The VA is good, the music is good, in one episode the first living assistroid goes to the earth and in the end she sings a good song which Chihara Minori performs.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
They are good, Aoi is interesting, Eris is naive but likeable and not annoying as you would imagine naive characters are, Manami is good and Kakazu is not a wuss but also not a pervert but the ones that i liked the most were the assistroids specially Chu Yun Fat.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I really liked the ecchi this has to offer but the comedy is decent and the characters were good, there&#039;s also winks at other animes like Hidan no Aria, Kampfer (which was mediocre) and others, i had a good time watching this.

    My score follows the MAL word associated with it; hence the 4 is a &#039;Bad&#039;. However, everyone&#039;s tastes are different and encourage you to read the points below rather than just my rating.<br />
<br />
-A few Clichés.<br />
Now there is not really anything bad with having clichés if you like them. You got your cat girl and a few other characters living with the dense and useless lead. If these are your cups of tea they are implemented pretty well. However, if you are looking for something new there is not a lot to offer.<br />
<br />
-This is a harem show, <br />
You will find yourself rooting for Aoi, like me,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31227">
        or the cat girl Eris. However, the show is biased and behind Aoi most of the time, even the childhood friend Manami is giving her assistance regretfully. While the male lead is thick, the interaction between Aoi and Manami made this show enjoyable. <br />
<br />
- and it has a Relative solution to the harem.<br />
I am saying this in partly to not to expect a completely open end; It does well to provide some closure so you don&#039;t kick and scream when it is over. However, i am not praising it.<br />
<br />
-Lots of fighting.<br />
I am surprised that Action is not one of the tags for this show actually. The first two or so episodes are highly enjoyable and give you high expectations for the rest of the series. While the action dies down over time essentially everyone, except Kio, provides us with a lot of enjoyable gun fights. Don&#039;t worry though, the bullets later on only destroy non-organic matter!<br />
<br />
-This show suffers from little plot in between the start and end.<br />
The integration of Eris into the cast, the first arc, is enjoyable and fast paced. However, soon it reverts into a episodic style that slowly grows stale, and the only sanction is the development of Aoi. As if the producers noticed this, they slap in an ending arc which results in our lame Kio saving Earth.<br />
 In<br />
<br />
-Character development is minimal.<br />
The only two characters focused on are Manami and Aoi. Both Kio and Eris lay out the road to our story, but there is very little focus on them growing in any way. Without spoiling the end, the two girls provide the bulk of the development as they struggle to understand their emotions.<br />
<br />
-Low comedic value.<br />
I am not easily amused. While the assistroids are entertaining to watch, i wouldn&#039;t claim to have laughed at all during this show.

    Okay. I&#039;m going to say right now I&#039;m completely unfair.. but I&#039;m sick of this nonsense.<br />
<br />
Here I go into thinking this will have a protagonist I can get behind!<br />
<br />
But no.. it&#039;s a lil kid with a female voice.<br />
<br />
I want him to get killed so bad but sadly, thats not going to happen.<br />
<br />
He looks like I could just crush him between my fingers.<br />

Aside from the laughable plot (is the lil kid the only one NOT part of a secret organization/alien? what happened to the secrecy if everyone is in the club?) and the stupid little nerd.. everything looked and sounded nice.

    Hey I just want to start off by saying that this is only a review based off of my own opinion and personal experience watching the show. So for anyone who&#039;s seen the show and may be offended or otherwise, I apologize in advance. Cat Planet Cuties, as it is dubbed by Funimation, revolves around a young high schooler named Kio Kakuza, who one day meets a young, beautiful, busty girl with cat ears and a tail, named Eris, claiming to be an alien. Apparently her and other members of her race, came to Earth in order to set up friendly relations with humans. Not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105231">
        soon after though, Kio and Eris are constantly being pursued by multiple factions with different plans in mind. <br />
<br />
Story 4/10: The story was fairly decent at best, but not all that interesting. Now I&#039;m open to all types of different genres, in fact ecchi/harem&#039;s are among my favorites, which is what this show classifies as. However I think as a Sci-fi this would be more enjoyable with more action. It&#039;s pretty much just a bunch of fan service although I rather enjoy fan service. <br />
<br />
Art 9/10: I normally don&#039;t have any complaints about the artwork in a show and I&#039;m not going to start now. The art isn&#039;t anything unique or new, but it&#039;s not horrible either.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10: I thought the soundtrack was pretty good and nothing to really complain about.  I especially found the opening theme rather enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Character 6/10: The character development is fair at best, nothing all that special. You got your typical girl from another world who for no real reason falls in love with the main protagonist and is normally as ditzy as she is big-boobed. Then you got the child-hood friend who&#039;s hot and totally in love with the main character, but just can&#039;t admit it.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s an okay anime and it might be worth your time, but hey. <br />
<br />
Anyways this is my review and I hoped you enjoyed it. Thanks.

    [THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br />
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />
<br />
INTERGALACTIC  ALLIANCE DECREE<br />
<br />
We, the members of the Underside of Kitten Paw, have forge a new alliance with Catia. This partnership will not only enhance the prosperity and trust between us, but, also, to affirm our Goddess and Savior is the one and only Eris. We swear to assist and provide  protection against enemies that endanger the safety and well-being of our Goddess and her fellow Catians. In return, we only ask that the Goddess, herself, graces us with her presences from time to time.<br />
<br />
SIX ORDINANCES<br />
<br />
In an effort to build a stronger relationship with our fellow Catians, we have observed 12

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194995">
        videos that detail our Goddess’ life and her daily encounters with Earth’s surroundings. We have, therefore, written six ordinances that follow our Goddess’ behavior. All current and future members should follow these ordinances:<br />
<br />
1) Thou Shalt Worship Cat Ears and Cat Tails<br />
<br />
	– Cat ears and cat tail have been adored by hundreds of people around the world. They evoke emotions of cuteness, of softness, and of fluffiness. We have satisfied our love by wearing fake cat ears and cat tails. That is, until the arrival of our Goddess, Eris; her authentic cat ears and cat tails prove that the real ones are far superior to fakes. We can toss aside our fakes, and worship the real ones. Praise those lovely cat ears and cat tails!<br />
<br />
2) Thou Shalt Not Kill<br />
<br />
	– As stated by Catian law, murder is not permitted. As such, bullets and other devices that dissolve inorganic matter, while preserving organic matter was developed. We approve such a respectable law and have adopted it ourselves. The results were impressive! Our Goddess battled against tanks, but they were easily dissolved by the touch of her hammer, leaving behind no vehicle and only naked men. Our Goddess’ friends used magic bullets on assassins, and on Russian soldiers. The results: nothing left behind, but naked individuals. What our Goddess is telling us is to humiliate our enemies by stripping them nude.<br />
<br />
3) Enemies of Catia Shall Be Our Enemy<br />
<br />
	– In the beginning, our enemies were members of the Beautiful Contact led by Maki Itokazu, Aoi from the Immigration Bureau of Japan, and Manami Kinjou from the CIA recruitment program. Their target was to eliminate our Goddess, Eris. However, one person stood by her, his name was Kio Kakazu. This young boy stopped the attacks and managed to recruit and convince Aoi, Manami Kinjou, and Maki Itokazu into saving Eris from a military compound. Then, afterwards, our brilliant Goddess sent a message to her mothership, telling them that the grilled beef was excellent, which prompted them to appear overhead. They signed a treaty with the Japanese Government and, thus, are not considered an enemy. This prevented future attacks from the Beautiful Contact, Immigration Bureau of Japan, and the CIA. Then, a new enemy appeared called Dogisia. They attacked a ship with our Goddess and her friends on board, hoping to sink the ship and take our Goddess with it. They attacked a camp site where our Goddess and her friends were eating. They raided the Catian Embassy (i.e. Kio’s house). And they attacked a Catian ship, which had other catians. In the end, they were annihilated in space. We assisted our Goddess and her friends by providing money, weapons, and fighting maids. Fuck with us! And our maids will kill you!<br />
<br />
4) Thou Shalt Wear Skimpy Clothing or None At All<br />
<br />
	– It would seem our Goddess loves to walk around in bare clothing, wearing, sometimes, only underwear and a long shirt. Most times, she wears her alien cat suit and swimsuit to flaunt her large breast, a very proud thing to display. Her friends, on the other hand, go to more extreme lengths. Members of Catian mothership, wore nothing, but typical Japanese swimsuits to a negotiation, it was very effective. Aoi and Manami sometimes fight in ridiculous clothing, such as a Gundam suit and a playboy suit. They, also, fought with no clothing at all. Based on our Goddess’ and her friends’ behavior, it would seem wearing skimpy clothing is appropriate for any situation, as everyone around them seem completely oblivious to it.<br />
<br />
5) Thou Shalt Forgo Traits That Develop One’s Character<br />
<br />
	– Our Goddess has encountered many people on Earth, and they all share one similarity. They all lack some character traits or backstory. The members of Catian mothership, what is their backstory, why do they want to fly this specific ship and their reasons for exploring the galaxy? Well, to us, members of Underside of Kitten Paw, we have no need to understand this information. Kio Kakazu seems to be a good-natured person, who is kind, caring, and really dense when it comes to love. Aoi is your typical shy girl whose crush just so happens to be near her target person. Manami Kinjou is a gun frantic with a tomboy attitude and personality, who is always complaining. Maki Itokazu is a teacher, the leader of the Beautiful Contact and that’s it, from thereon, she complains that our Goddess, Eris, is not a real alien. The villain, Janes, has a motive for her actions, but her personality is one-dimensional, it never changes. We, as members of this organization, should strive to not have any traits that develop one’s character.<br />
<br />
6) Thou Shalt Respect the Catian Customs and Laws<br />
<br />
	– There were several Catian Laws that we would like to acknowledge: (1) Polyamory – when a man can have more than one lover, this practice was the solution to Kio’s problem when he was loved by Aoi, Manami, and Eris, our Goddess. This directly resulted in a harem ending. (2) On the 16th birthday, our Goddess went into heat and was having sexual desires, unfortunately, it hindered her fighting abilities and, thus, she had to take a pill to end her mating period. (3) All Catians must own an assist-a-roid, this machine can pretty do anything, except talk, they have no mouths and no emotionally responses.<br />
<br />
By following these six ordinances, we hope that our relationship with Catians rises. We hope that one day, we may obtain a power to grow cat ears and cat tails. We hope that our Goddess continues to grace us with her presences.<br />
<br />
All Hail Our Goddess!<br />
<br />
All Hail Eris!<br />
<br />
All Hail Eris!

    What to say...<br />
<br />
-nekomimi girl from outer space<br />
-otaku girl who as a room filled with REAL weapons<br />
-meganekko with super powered suit that leaves no space to imagination<br />
-crazy uncle with (God knows why) bombs and guns<br />
<br />
Nice anime you might say...<br />
<br />
Well only in part. The premise is good, the graphics nice, the fanservice everywhere.<br />
<br />
Big letdown...the male protagonist; For Heavens sake is he a Stereotype!!!<br />
<br />
But if You manage to get over him, you might enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
Thus overall rating: 7

    In the beginning, I was intrigued by the concept of an extraterrestrial getting mixed with covert ops. Asobi ni Iku yo! gradually turned into some form of harem story where the indecisive omega male gets the ladies. The series is a love letter  to cat lovers and the technology featured is something to think about. The series is greatly flawed by the holes in its plot. Overall, Asobi ni Iku yo provides light-hearted entertainment that&#039;s neither spectacular nor absolutely horrible.

    Ok, first of all, this is my first time writing a review, but I felt like I need to after reading the biased, argumentative feelings this anime brought to the table. <br />
<br />
I am going to start out with the negatives, just because they are the first things I noticed within the anime, but if you read on, I guarantee positives will come from it. <br />
<br />
1) The story had literally no character development whatsoever, everyone just happened to either be part of the CIA, a terrorist organization, or the immigration bureau. and all be centered around this one guy who happens to be who the ecchi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31364">
        alien takes a liking to. The story itself is plot-hole city, and the ending is disappointing as hell, with so much unexplained, but I still recommend watching it for yourself.<br />
<br />
2) This show literally refused not be be the cliche of the age-old cats vs. dogs scenario, and when I first saw it, I was like, &#039;This is just stupid.&#039; And it was. Extremely. <br />
<br />
3) This story is fan service central, with all the main characters being in positions where they are at least half-naked at least once per episode, and it just got to the point where it was a bit ridiculous. But, being the pervert that I am, I found myself questioning it because &#039;Why draw so much hentai if you are just going to blur it out? Make a censored and uncensored version, or just pull off a Love Hina (If you know what I mean) and just use the characters hair or the surroundings to hide it, instead of just white clouds of piss-off. <br />
<br />
4) The story itself ended somewhat half-heartedly, with an easy to create OVA that could have followed it. Personally, I think they ran out of money in the budget.<br />
<br />
Ok, now after going through that, let&#039;s explain the fun parts of this show.<br />
<br />
1) Personally, I loved  the ending, which I can&#039;t get into right now, but just know that it was satisfying enough that everyone wins. Its like the show couldn&#039;t decide where its fan-base put its faith, but I think they made the right decision. Its what every (at least male) fan wants to see. But like I said in my disappointments, it ended half-heartedly.<br />
<br />
2) All the aliens were female, and that is kind of the reason I wanted to watch this anime. It added flavor to my list of anime angels, cosplayers, pokemon, and incest. Sadly, each and every one of those is true.<br />
<br />
3) There was lots of action that actually fit the story, and it kind of off-balanced the whole &quot;stupid&quot; part of it, and it is something that kept the story going.<br />
<br />
4) Lastly, I thought the art of this was beautiful, it was so tropical and colorful, yet fit each and every surrounding that the characters decided to settle down in. I gave art a 9, character and sound an 8, enjoyment a 7 and story a 6. My Overall was 7. I hope you guys found this review helpful!

    Nyaa!!!!  Alien kitty goodness.  I just have to say that if an alien who had the form of a hot girl with kitty ears and a tail, I would question if she was real, or just cos-playing.  Wouldn&#039;t you?  If memory serves me right everyone just accepted her and was like &quot;hey we are having a party want to join us?&quot;   WHAT?!  The main humor is that since she is an alien she doesn&#039;t know what is considered normal on earth.  So one of the first books that she reads is a book that was found under

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35534">
        Kio&#039;s bed.  I am just going to let you think about that.<br />
<br />
I like how they emphasize the realness of the cat ears and tails.  How they move and twitch.  I thought that it was a nice little touch.  Little details like that are honestly are what make certain anime better than others.  You can&#039;t just throw a bunch of big boob girls together and make a good anime...... Well maybe you can, but that is besides the point. the point that I was trying to make.  The point that I wanted to make is that I have watched a fair amount of anime, and when I see things that I can relate to other anime it puts a smile on my face.  ^_^<br />
<br />
Opening theme was too easy going sounding.  It should have been a little more fast pace in my opinion.  I say this because the main idea of this anime is the fight for earth, along with the love story on the side.<br />
<br />
Okay I mean really?!  Both Manami and Aoi are secret agents?!  I mean how much more farfetched can you get.  Fine I mean we are already taking about aliens why not go all the way.  I may not have not liked the idea personally at first, but the way that both of the them get incorporated into the story line was very interesting. <br />
<br />
OMG I love the robots!  It was so funny because at one point they have numbers drawn on their foreheads since nobody can tell them apart.  They can&#039;t talk so they communicate using a sign.  All they have to do is turn the sign and the words on it changes.  It&#039;s soo cool.  <br />
...But, not as cool as the gun that makes clothes disappear.  I gave this anime a 7 since I thought that the story line was something new for me and I enjoyed it.  New things are always good.<br />
It may not be new to you but it was a new experience for me.

    Well, at first I didn’t know anything about this. I guessed by the name it may be pretty fan service oriented but when I turned on the first episode, it actually looked like it would be serious. Boy, was I wrong with that idea. It turns into a big harem mess. It’s almost just like Please Teacher mixed with other Harem shows. <br />
<br />
It’s all about food, boobs, and very little bit about the Sci-fi stuff. Let me give you an example of how this show doesn’t take itself too seriously. Eris beats a million tanks with hammers, even taking the clothing of the tank guys

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71543">
        inside. And just when I thought the show was about to end, the show got even stranger with the cat girls going to a meeting wearing school girl swimsuits with a magical girl transformation showing naked images. The third show even starts out with a version of the Star Trek opening altered for the cat aliens. <br />
<br />
I do have a question, where the heck are all the male cat boys? I with I could see more diverse gender to this instead of all the girls… and this isn’t just because I’m a girl. I do like a lot of designs for anthro girls but I also like the ideas for the men as well. The only male we do see from cat world is an image of his mouth. We see no tail or ears and even his eyes are hidden from us.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of references to Star Trek and a couple other shows that any Trekie would probably fall in love with it. There is a special episode also that isn’t all that funny. Episode 9 talks more about how that catians and earthlings feel the same about a song that played for a special Sci-fi anime. The song is rather beautiful and gives the feeling of loneliness in space. <br />
<br />
Kio is just like Kei from Please Teacher. His voice, personality, almost everything feels pretty much like a copy of him except for the stand still-thing. He lets people push him around mostly, and is pretty much a guy that acts older then he is. He even stays with a perverted uncle. The girls feel like they were all pushed onto him and it really is too much like they just pushed every type of supernatural or alien idea into one small little area of Japan. The only character with any real since is Aoi. The reason why I say that is she doesn’t get made right away when Kio ends up with cat girls hanging all over him because of reading a magazine.<br />
<br />
The artwork is standard. Kio even looks like Kei from Please Teacher and Eris looks much like a sexual version of Horo from Spice and Wolf. Most designs feel like they were stolen from other animes. Its standard all the way threw from the character design to the background.<br />
<br />
The English voices are standard too, and yet seem to fit with the style of the show. It’s pretty much standard all the way threw so nothing special but yet I guess I could say that it would be pretty fun to see how it pans out. I would really see this as a watch show.<br />

    I just don&#039;t understand why people don&#039;t like this and found it boring because I for one loved it. The characters, the art, the music, and the overall funny/happy atmosphere. First off lets talk about my favorite character Eris. Eris is a alien cat girl who was sent to earth to learn more about it when she meets Kio who was kind enough to aid her on her mission.  after the first day on earth we learn that she is always kind, always asking questions, has a childlike innocence, cares deeply about her friends, LOVES food, and she is mostly in heat which i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168235">
        found funny.  My only complaint is that she is equipped with a power suit and has a hammer that can make tanks vanish, but she only has 3 fighting scenes while the other characters got to fight in all of the episodes, but she is still awesome. Another thing i liked about this show was the art. The art in this was amazing, there were colors everywhere and the amount of detail they put in for even the smallest things like the leave, the sidewalk, and the cars were outstanding. And last but not least the atmosphere. This show always had a happy vibe to it. There were no sad back stories, none of the good guys died, and at the end all three girls decided to share Kio together so everything worked out in the end. This anime had such a good vibe that i watched it over and over again, but I cant seem to find another anime like this, making this a one of a kind masterpiece.  I just wished that they kept it on air so we could have seen how this story progressed.

    Welcome to another RTLR review! Dub is our poison as always. I gotta man up and admit that I am in no way an &#039;elitist&#039; when it comes to anime, at least I don&#039;t think I am. I make no bones about watching harem and ecchi titles along with more &#039;emotionally mature&#039; fare. This time tho, with Cat Planet Cuties, we have a whole lot of nothing, tired tropes, and nonsensical elements that all come together and make for a strangely entertaining series. Straight up, if fan service doesn&#039;t do it for you, then by all means consider the overall score a 1. If you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335934">
        do enjoy titles like Highschool DxD or To-Love Ru, then there&#039;s some fun to be had here, even if it comes with a little grain of salt. <br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
There&#039;s nothing to really write home about story wise, and that&#039;s okay, there&#039;s not really supposed to be any high drama going on. There&#039;s a fair bit of action, and lots of shooting happens in between fan service scenes, but nothing is truly ever explained or expounded upon. What we get here is an adorable cat girl coming to Earth to make contact only to find that many different groups want to hold her for their own ends, and come to find out, the main cast around the main guy are all members of these various outfits. Cat alien just happens to land in bed with a regular guy, and just so happens one of his friends works for the CIA, the other works for the Japanese Immigration Board, and they all have designs on this newly arrived visitor! Throw in a weird cult based on catgirls, and another cult hell bent to have first &#039;official&#039; contact with aliens be something more appropriate, and there&#039;s plenty of reasons to send bullets flying all over. Of course our main guy is absolutely clueless as to what is going on, and as to the true identities of his long time best friends. Hell, even an &#039;uncle&#039; anime version of P.I. Magnum shows up and he *still* has trouble putting two and two together. <br />
<br />
After an icy reception from the Japanese government in meeting the catgirls, things become tense for a while. The catgirls don&#039;t know that their mortal enemy, the dog-girls have secretly made contact and are supplying tech to the humans. The first handful of plots revolve around this action, and sets up the intensity of the show nicely. After both sides of aliens are aware of each other, it lowers the tension some, and allows for much more fanservice time. <br />
<br />
And when it comes to fan service, boy do we ever get it. Nudity is not a thing in this anime with breast of all sizes trotted out for the world to see. Lots of sexually compromising incidents come up, eliciting laughs here and there, and trying it&#039;s very best to be sexy. There is also a semi-harem situation present, as the tho long time human friends of the main guy both are madly in love with him, yet the newly arrived catgirl also seems to instantly carry a torch for him as well, even offering him to be her first mating partner as she enters heat for the first time. The overall actions of each girl tends to pertain to their own feelings for the main guy. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s cheesy action, cheesy dialog, and even cheesier fan service, but pulled off with aplomb. Most of the cast seem to enjoy their performances. <br />
<br />
Now to the bad beats that force me to rate this no higher than a 5. The alien girl trope is done to DEATH by now. We&#039;ve seen it so much it&#039;s not even close to original. The high pitched alien girl who has no sense of personal boundaries or modesty checks off another box on the &#039;tired old trope&#039; list. One human friend, the big chested CIA agent is played off as aggressive and pushy, trying her best to push the flat chested Immigration girl into the main guy&#039;s arms before the catgirl beats her to the punch. The eye-rolling &#039;secret&#039; is that CIA girl is deeply in love with main guy and has been for ages and ages, she&#039;s just been to scared to openly admit her feelings for him. <br />
<br />
The Immigration girl is your typical &#039;sure he can&#039;t love me, I&#039;m no good&#039; type who constantly blunders every romantic attempt she makes with him (or is forced into by CIA girl). She has super low self esteem and sees herself as nothing but a cold blooded killer unworthy of love. This sentiment is of course reversed by the series end, as is CIA girl&#039;s coming clean about her feelings. <br />
<br />
The catgirl doesn&#039;t seem to have any reason to have a romantic link to the main guy but still does. She basically ends up meeting him first and instantly falls for him. Yeah, he&#039;s a nice guy, but there&#039;s a lot of nice guys out there. So her sudden and fierce devotion to him seems a little forced. <br />
<br />
Another point that irked me relates to international (or in this case inter-spacial law) after the initial meeting with the leaders of Japan, the catgirls are denied official relations but informal relations are still allowed. Kind of a &#039;we&#039;ll pretend we don&#039;t see you so don&#039;t make too much noise&#039; kind of situation. The problem with that, especially considering the dog-girls are already behind the scenes, is that the catgirls immediately declare the main guy&#039;s house their sovereign territory, not compliant to Earth laws but only Catian. How can someone establish a legal embassy without formal relations with the government? Not only do they do so, they do things like fire off weapons and other training activities at the residence, which is in the middle of town. <br />
<br />
The enemies being dog-girls is cliche so bad it hurts. While the human military offers token resistance in the beginning it really comes down to a fight between cat and dog. Predictable, but stupidly so. Another asinine thing is the catgirls have guns that fire bullets that destroy inorganic material but do no damage to flesh. Yeah, as you can guess, they are used several times to disrobe various girls. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s like the show took tons of notes from other shows and kind of crammed them in together, with slice of life beach trips, action oriented battle scenes, and steamy, sexy time moments. In the end, they don&#039;t really execute any of them very well. Finally, why do catgirls have human ears? What&#039;s the point when they have cat ears? If I remember right, Konohana Kitan had cat/fox girls and they didn&#039;t have human ears! It is slightly confusing for them to have both listening organs. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I though this one looked really good. The character design was very well done, though there are some stock characters to be found, the glasses wearing doctor, the loli (in this case 2) and the busty captain of the catgirls. They aren&#039;t poorly done, just typical. They still are drawn with an eye for quality. The two humans are very well done in my eyes, and are very expressive through the artwork. The big knock for me is the assistdroids both the cats and the dogs use. They are cute, chibi style, but while not badly drawn, I found their appearance to be grating for some reason. The backgrounds look fine, and special effects pop and add to the flavor of the battles. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The opening theme is fun and I really enjoyed it. None of the closing themes did anything for me, but they got the job done, being airy and appropriate for an anime about boobs and bangs. The background music was nice, and the special effects sound effects are exactly what one would expect. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is where the show shines. There are some heavy hitter dub actresses in the series and they all sound wonderful. None of them sound bored or overacted. The main catgirl can be a little pitchy, but that&#039;s intentional I think to match her carefree, curious attitude. She reels it in before it becomes overbearing however. The mean girl is pushy and has the perfect voice, and the subdued girl sound equally out of her element and lacking in confidence. The main guy isn&#039;t bad, he&#039;s just your average joe, nothing remarkable about his voice whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
I rated this objectively this low because even though I thoroughly enjoyed many of them. The main catgirl is cute beyond compare, a complete airhead, and bumbles cutely from one embarrassing situation to the next. She does help out at times, but seems to be reminded that she has the extra powers that her alien race has. She seems intently in love/lust with the main character for no real give reason. She&#039;s always dressing provocatively and sometimes encourages sexual proclivity, something we&#039;ve seen a thousand times by now in other harem and/or ecchi shows. <br />
<br />
The Immigration girl is in love with the main guy, having known him a while, but because she&#039;s an assassin, she feels she can never be loved. She feels her hands are covered in too much blood to ever hold someone. She has superb tactical skills and kicks all the ass when the time comes, but when it&#039;s time to talk to the main guy, she stutters and stammers and often flees the scene. The overly shy badass has been ran into the ground too. <br />
<br />
The CIA girl is the friend that has known the main guy the longest, and is also in love with him since way back. She failed to make her move, and through a misunderstanding comes to believe that she has lost her chance for true love with him. She compensates for this by living vicariously through the Immigration girl, trying to fix her up and give her what CIA girl wants but never had. The best friend pushing another girl into a relationship with the guy while having feelings for him herself is way overused. <br />
<br />
The main guy is just clueless, though he catches on quicker than most. He isn&#039;t rankled by finding a catgirl alien in his bed, he&#039;s not even all that bothered when he finds out that both his friends were secret assassin agents for different government agencies. He trots around saying &#039;I won&#039;t let anything bad happen to girl x,y, or z&#039; and fumbles ass backwards into saving the day. He&#039;s also exasperated by the sexual attention when most kids at say 15-18 would be jumping in bed with anything that even smiled at him. Instead he&#039;s too &#039;pure&#039;, a trait all harem/ecchi show leads seem to espouse. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Honestly I liked this series. It was a lot of fun even with the messed up plot developments, the groan worthy setup for action scenes, and the dog assistdroid that did nothing but sound like Muttley (only you older folks likely get that one) but despite those failings, it was still engaging and fun. Was it stupid? Yes. Was it stupid fun? Hell yes. Objectively I cannot recommend it to the general audience, but if you are into harem/ecchi and similar titles, you&#039;ll find many tropes, but you&#039;ll probably find some nuggets of humor in there too. <br />
<br />
Best Girl: Immigration agent Aoi. Sure she&#039;s shy and has to be pushed hard to admit her feelings for the main guy, but she is also a total badass with the power to teleport close objects directly into her hands (mainly guns). That&#039;s a nice power, and she&#039;s not obnoxiously fan servicey like a lot of the other characters. I gotta love a ass kicking but yet shy girl in glasses, so Aoi takes the cake!<br />
<br />
Really it&#039;s not that great of a show unless you&#039;re in the mind for empty, stupid humor and blushingly ecchi moments. This title was made with a certain viewer in mind, and if you&#039;re not one of those, you&#039;ll probably hate it, probably won&#039;t make it through the first episode. However, if you like a little eye candy, some explosions, over the top situations and somewhat groan-inducing comedy, you might just want a Cat Planet Cutie of your own!

    &quot;Asobi ni Iku Yo&quot; is a show that looked promising and started off promising yet by the end turned into something bad.<br />
 The show had much promise, but it was ruined by a bad plot, bad character development and a very annoying so called main character, the main character being someone you want to kill just for his pure stupidity, of course all the girls in this anime seem to love him because...........well.............cause he&#039;s the main character.<br />
All I can say is that this show could have been a whole lot better if it was written differently.

    Asobi ni Iku yo, the story of cat and dog aliens coming to earth and making contact with the humans who live upon it.  Eris a cute cat girl meets a young boy and falls for him.  She decides to live with him to explore and learn more about Earth.  He has several other friends that are girls that all love him, or like him in that manner.  He of course has no idea and goes about his daily activities as such.  This anime isn&#039;t bad.  I recommend to anyone wanting to watch a cute anime that has a

        little bit of action in it.  There are some parts that drag on because they discuss their similarities which are being in love with the same person, but it isn&#039;t bad.  They cat aliens end up finding out that the dog aliens are there and it causes some level of conflict.  Will it ever be resolved?  Watch and see...

    Ok, so this is more like an extraordinary situation were black ops mixed with ET and added with child&#039;s play kinda thing, I like the characters the way that they were drawn and the setting, were it is set on the southern part of Japan, in Okinawa. Eris, the lead female character seem to have the combination of Lala from &quot;To Love Ru&quot; and  Horo from &quot;Spice and Wolf,&quot; but just like any light novel animes it is still a combination of different genre for each episode which by the way I kinda hate the musical part about a space man in ep9. Then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32023">
        again that first assistant droid  could  had a longer role within the series. My main criticism is the authors and illustrators idea of arming the 2 girls Minami and Aoi which basically doesn&#039;t have the right body mass to weapon recoil ration e.g. when Aoi pull up a 3.57 Colt Python against her chauffeur/ handler I&#039;m surprise that she can handle a gun that weight about 5lbs and has a recoil of baseball batter when fired for a pettit girl like her to handle, if a girl with the body mass and height like that of Aoi were fire that kind of gun, she would also get hurt in the process because the gun&#039;s blow back would literally throw itself back  towards her co&#039;z she&#039;s unable to control it. For Minami, she was branded by Kio as gun otaku, if she is then why is ep6 she requested for a M134 Minigun that is not mounted in a tripod only to find out that it&#039;s just to heavy for her to lift ? As a gun otaku it is important that you know what gun you can handle and what you can&#039;t handle, that doesn&#039;t seem to be the case with Minami who only has an average IQ for guns, also, Aoi is seen using a Dragunov Sniper rifle  in ep8, black ops usually shy away from that kind of rifle because of it&#039;s limited accuracy most would either use an H&amp;K PSG 1 sniper rifle, A1 Arctic Warfare or Remington Bolt Action Rifle. Also there were instances were the girls handled various 9mm pistols but can still prove to much for a petite girl to handle. However I can give credit for the illustrator for making Aoi use the S&amp;W 38 police special for the rest of the series  it is basically a kind of gun which petite teenagers can handle. I also noticed that in ep7 there is a German WW2 MG42  featured, doesn&#039;t  the illustrator know that such weapon is no longer being manufactured and the M249 SAW is the most widely used machine gun amongst armed forces like Japan&#039;s SDF? <br />
<br />
You know, I think authors and illustrators should not just focus on any gun for the character, it is important that a certain gun should match the character&#039;s physique, age and combat role, if we&#039;ll look at the more matured characters in the anime we can seen that the guns they possess matched their physique   like Antonia&#039;s maid which is understandable that they also functions as her body guards, in fact, it should be Kio&#039;s uncle who should be possessing the 3.57 Colt Python and M134 Minigun in the first place, as for the Dragunov Sniper Rifle it kinda looks good for Maki Itokazu (Kio&#039;s teacher) to handle it.  So just like that certain guns should be match like jewelry for certain character.<br />
<br />
Trivia: It is Illegal in Japan for a citizen to own a gun, do you know that not all law enforcement officers in Japan carry a gun? In fact only the SDF, SAT and those assign for body guard duty were allowed to carry a firearms. Even thought Japan&#039;s police were trained to shoot, their standard issue Nambu cal 37 Revolver were always left in the station under lock and key only to be use for very special emergencies.

    If  you  want to be  truly critical , this  anmie does have  lot of faults  , but that doesn&#039;t stop  it  from being a pretty  good watch either.<br />
<br />
It  does  well in the fact , that it has a interesting  cross dynamic of characters ,(and genres) that help propel the story along.Not  letting   it become  too lopsided  one  way or the other.The flip side of this , that it seems sometimes it  cant  make  which way it wants to go.<br />
<br />
whilst there is a bit of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39575">
        fan service , at heart, this anmie is trying to tell a story.It does try to give us some back ground in to the various characters , though to be honest  this  anime  would  have better been served  by 24  episodes rather than 12. <br />
<br />
in conclusion ,This  anime isn&#039;t quite  what  you would think by reading the  description and will surprise  you , with some of  its depth and  humor  wortha look..
