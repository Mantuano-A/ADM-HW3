    Why didn’t I drop this?<br />
<br />
[Contains vague spoilers, then again, it&#039;s so predictable a caveman could do it, also contains some offensive language]<br />
<br />
C³ is best described as an atrocity then again, that might be considered a generous title. This would be the “ideal troll” series to give somebody to watch. It’s not very good in storyline, and the characters are the aggravating type of cliché. It follows the generic harem law of everybody falling in love with the average dude, and it offers incessant and redundant fan service. The series basically follows this extremely unique and innovative storyline:<br />
<br />
Boy meets unique and strange girl, strange girl is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49569">
        suffering from a curse, boy wants to help girl, girl denies boy’s kindness and runs away after accidentally hurting boy, boy finds girl and basically accepts girl, then girl learns the meaning of friendship. Innovative and original right? Normally, the storyline wouldn’t be aggravating on its own but it’s just portrayed and executed in such an obnoxious way.<br />
<br />
The majority of the episodes are generally composed of 60% school/fan service, then 30% actual plot, with the 10% being the OP and ED. The series basically started off as excessive moe fan service followed by an episode or two of melodrama. Then it led into some action, which was surprisingly pretty cool. Then it fell into the inevitable plight of more melodrama, love triangles; then from episode eight onwards, it’s visited by sporadic random tentacles[perhaps, slightly exaggerated].<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the actual plot does actually exist, albeit rushed and poorly told. The small plot is littered with mediocre storytelling and incessant fan service. C³ basically tries to develop a seemingly serious plot, but the plot is about as creative and unpredictable as Bleach’s. The plot basically revolves around trying to alleviate the girl’s curse, but it does it in such a bad way. Numerous questions are raised with each episode, and they are answered, but are done so in such a mediocre way. C3 is titled a harem, ecchi comedy with action elements; if it actually stayed with those genres, rather than attempt an asinine, darker one [which it fails to do], then this review wouldn&#039;t exist [It would be like being irritated at the fan service in a series labeled as an ecchi romance; I don&#039;t like C3 because it tries to incorporate more genres than it can handle.] <br />
<br />
To be fair, most series raise questions, but they answer them. Now how do they answer them? Well, most of them would answer them through subtle hints, actions, and perhaps even some dialogue. How does C³ do it? Well, they do it through dialogue. Not intelligent dialogue, but in blatant “Why did this happen”s and “What was that”s. Now imagine the end of a mystery anime, where everything is resolved, there’s been a few subtle, yet significant clues, and the main detective puts it all together, in blatant monologue. Now, if C³ was a mystery anime, that wouldn’t be so bad, but it does this without any clues. They literally just commune a meeting and go, “What was that?” and well, that’s how the majority of the questions were answered, in Q and A format, intelligent right?<br />
<br />
Now C³ isn’t an entirely bad series. It does have a few redeeming “good” points. The art and animation is simple, yet in some scenes it’s done really well. Both openings look great[it&#039;s simple, but they actually do look good], and the ending theme fits. The action scenes are also pretty cool, the history behind the torture weapons, and the actual fighting isn’t bad. It’s entertaining when it comes to that, but besides that, it doesn’t have much going for it. Basically, imagine Bleach with more melodrama, and much more boobs, tentacles, and panty shots.<br />
<br />
Objective Score: 3/10. It’s the irritating type of below average, it’s not good, and it’s not enjoyable. This show was actually one of the few that I fell behind on due to the incessant bullshit I put through while watching it.<br />
<br />
Subjective Score: 3/10: It’s still shit. If you’re into tentacles, panty shots, incessant fan service, and boobs, you’ll probably like this. If you want a decent storyline, or even decent characters, you probably wouldn’t like this. The show is mostly fan service, and the plot itself is mostly ridiculous and only used to further develop the fan service

    This review for C3 will be based on opinions made after viewing the first episode of the series, and will also give a brief overview of the first episode to enlighten those who may have an interest in this deep, suteki (tl note, Suteki = great omg nihongo xD) anime. <br />
<br />
This kakkoi, perverted boy (tl note: kakkoi means cool) receives a gift from his otou-sama, which turns out to be a cube, which then turns out to be a naked, silver haired, kleptomaniac loli(and I must praise this for its originality on this part, we never have had girls randomly appear and suddenly live with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44589">
        the MC before). A very cute one, I might add. She’s perfect in all proportions. A beautiful, budding chest. Eyes that glimmer with innocence, hips that are clearly not ready for bearing a child. And a bum that just screams at you. The show is focused entirely on her and all her cuteness, so these are important notes to keep in mind when you decide to watch the first episode. Her name is Fear. She also has some ability that curses her owner, but pervert-kun has an immunity to curses so it’s all kakkoi and stuff. You know, I was honestly staring at DFC-tan’s face the entire time so wakarimasenlol. They also introduced some yandere-looking childhood friend with cow udders, but because of that I will be neglecting her in this review. <br />
<br />
After the introduction of our silver-haired Goddess, pervert-kun, and other girl, the show quickly gets straight to the point of the story, the everyday actions of our lovely Fear. Pervert-kun leaves her home alone so he can go to “school”, like the cold hearted sod he is, so Fear decides to take her beautiful DFC self out into the town, where she quickly learns how nice everyone in Japan is. Somehow, she had actual outdoor apparel for this venture, despite her nor pervert-kun not actually going out to get any clothes, which can lead us to believe that pervert-kun is a closet crossdresser, or has some perverted hobby. Whatever the case, he seems like a cool guy for so quickly deciding to live with a DFC goddess like this and already having clothes for her(sasuga, pervert-kun). <br />
<br />
Fear feels a lot better about being abandoned for the day by pervert-kun and decides to repay his kindness (you know, giving her a free place, some clothes he already had for some reason, going to school instead of spending time with her ;~;) and put her housekeeping skills to the test! And as we would expect from a beautiful, flat chested girl like this (I just wanted to stroke her chest with my face, kiyaa~), she did a splendid job! So much that pervert-kun came home and gave her a sugoi speech. ^-^<br />
<br />
If you enjoy series that have as much of an original plot as this one does, and series with characters as subarashii(wonderful ^^) as our closet crossdresser pervert-kun and our delectable DFC honey, fear, then C³ is definitely an anime worth your time to check out!

    Rule 34.....<br />
Generally accepted fearsome internet rule that states that pornography or sexually related material exists for any conceivable subject.<br />
<br />
At first I was like....<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I bet that rule can&#039;t be applied to a freakin CUBE!&quot;<br />
<br />
........And thus C3 is born.......<br />
<br />
Normally I don&#039;t review animes on first episodes but I have to give my first impressions on this one as a clarify with those who wants to pick up this series. Will update as the anime progresses.<br />
<br />
Here we go! Another school battle royale! But this time with tools and objects transforming in gorgeous girls. Yachi Haruaki is a normal high school boy with a travelling parent whom

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44755">
        sends him backs souvenirs in the form of girls (oh god I wish my parents did that) but here&#039;s a twist. They&#039;re all cursed tools! So nne day, Haruaki receives a black cube from his old man. During the night, he encounters a NAKED (yea because that&#039;s how we normally encounter girls for the first time right guys?) silver haired girl stealing rice crackers. She is the human-form of the black cube, an instrument of torture called &quot;Fear in Cube&quot;. So thus began their newfound companionship in a battle royale against other cursed instruments in the form of girls. Sound familiar?<br />
<br />
The art and animation! Blindingly colourful and obviously similar to series such as Baka To Test? That&#039;s because the same director Oonuma Shin is in charge of both series. He was also the episode director of Bakemonogatari which is why C3 seem to have a bit of the &quot;SHAFT&quot; aspect to aspect approach.<br />
Character designs are pretty  average but the high luminosity design managed to grab my somewhat short attention span. I have nothing much to add about sound. Seiyuus portrayal of their characters are just average as well. However I do enjoy the BGM. It manage to expresses the torn conflict between peace and chaos in the anime.<br />
<br />
I will update character review as soon as the plot advances. For now we have our typical hero, Yachi Haruaki, whom is somewhat special ability of not being able to be cursed. What  prove do I have?<br />
&quot;Hey Yachi! You&#039;re a mother f*****!&quot;<br />
See? I can&#039;t curse him. Yeah I know that was lame. But you&#039;ve read it anyways.<br />
Joining him is Kubrick Fear a typical tsundere whom now have to cope with life as an average girl.<br />
Not much of an innovation to the whole anime scene but this is expected since the themes are comedy and ecchi. I can&#039;t complain if authors are to afraid to venture out and try new character development techniques. The easy way out to show character developments is of course employing the &quot;dere&quot; character cards.<br />
And last but not least a childhood friend with no redeeming qualities whatsoever (yet) except accelerated specific regional  body growth.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say I enjoyed watching the first episode. But I don&#039;t hate it as well. It is somewhat confusing. Is it trying to be funny? Is it trying to be dramatic? Philosophical? Moe-blob?<br />
Definitely trying to be a Moe-blob anime. So if you enjoy those and you&#039;&#039;ve got spare time why not pick up this anime and be the judge for yourself? Or you could think outside of the box and apply rule 34 to other everyday objects. <br />
<br />
Haremu Kingu,<br />
Signing off<br />
<br />

    First impression based on ep&#039; one - The intention of this review is to highlight elements of the story you may like or disslike, depending on your preferances and possibly, the time period you have neen watching anime in general...<br />
<br />
This series features a set-up which is quite familar:<br />
- tsundere galore<br />
- characters are school age<br />
- fight scenes that consist of neon coloured magic<br />
- cutsie, somewhat bratty loli who need looking after<br />
- overly passive male tsundere-victum type who accepts his lousy life<br />
- family issues - in this case, family conveniently out of the picture<br />
- unnessessary female sidekick who doesn&#039;t seem to have anything else to do<br />
- supernatural

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44633">
        being who&#039;s human appearance is a cute girl for no particular reason<br />
- humor in the form of ecchi related missunderstandings<br />
- unluck guy; the female(&#039;/s) are there to bring about a change<br />
I know that some of these factors above can easily attract or repel, as the familiar is great for some (who I could reccomend to) yet tedious for others (I wouldn&#039;t reccomend to) and if this is pretty much a starter anime for someone else, then go for it. ;D<br />

    After having watched the first 3 episodes of C^3, I must say this show really has potential.  After a light, almost excessively cheerful introduction, the show gets progressively more action packed, emotionally involved and takes a more serious tone revolving around sin, guilt and regrets.<br />
<br />
I found the art to be appealing, as is the case with most anime this season, I found the cast of voice actors to be strong, the main male lead in particular, and I found the pacing and development to be varied so as to accentuate the important parts.<br />
<br />
If you try to pin this show down with episode 1, then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45689">
        you&#039;re not going to give an accurate opinion on what it is.  It is a varied show with an interested plot mechanic and good production values, that is worth giving an hour of your time to to view the first three episodes.  Happy viewing!

    C³<br />
C cube was really rushed in the story, is like if they knew they were not going to make a 2nd season, and they wanted to throw a lot of content in just 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story at first is really great, but it goes down every episode, because it&#039;s not consistent, it&#039;s like there are three different stories on just 12 episodes, the first story was great, was dark and violent and the action was the best in that story, the 2nd one was fine but it wasn&#039;t what i expected, like, it slowed down the things and less violent and less dark and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195442">
        third one was ok, violent like the fisrt one and kind of dark but not shown like the first one, the ending was like if they are going to continue with a 2nd season because of the end, so if you put all of that together the overall is good.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
It really was very good, at first looked normal but then as the episode continues it has a dark tone and dark feel on the atmosphere, i liked the characters design.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound was very good, the VA and the music was good and the different OP and ED were just great, i really liked them a lot.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The dark past of Fear wasn&#039;t expected for me, i really didn&#039;t expected that and started to think if i was going to like her or not, but you will find out for yourself, Haruaki was normal but powerful with the help of his childhood friend Konoha, who happens to have her own abilities to help Haruaki, Kirika was great and i felt for what she was going,Kuroe was really adorable and funny and i felt sorry for the loli Amanda, overall was very good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
What i enjoyed the most were the first and last episodes, the middle ones were ok but not like the others level, the ending was unsatisfying but overall i had a very good enjoyment.

    Story- I think that the plot of the story wasn&#039;t very contestant. It added things and just dropped it off. I think that the story is like three different arcs (in away). I like the first two, but the last one was not very interesting and very confusing. I think there was stuff they forgot to wrap up or did do it properly. I will not say what it was because I don&#039;t want to give spoilers<br />
<br />
Art- The art is where this show shined the most. It was very colorful and lively. When it came to a time of a flash back or memories, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181060">
        style look like a puppet show. When it came to fights and intense scenes, the back round color would be greens or red. When humor was in play, there would be bright colors and funny doodles. <br />
<br />
Sound- the voice acting was very enjoyable. Every characters&#039; voice fit their attitude and personalty. A few voices i didn&#039;t like. there is no dub so I can&#039;t judge it. The opening really reflected the show. The first one was upbeat and lively, but a a quick dark moment to reflect the sadness and anger in the show. the second one was darker and more down toned.<br />
<br />
Character- The character were very nice and enjoyable. Some that only stayed for a few episodes I like because most of them weren&#039;t one dimensional.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- I like this show for the virus reasons I have list above. I just didn&#039;t enjoy the amount of fan service it had.

    I am going to be completely unbiased - this is an outstanding anime so far with an original plot. ** It is unfair to judge this anime based on the character&#039;s hairstyle, and give it a low rating just because it has some ecchi scenes. I certainly will not be doing that. **<br />
<br />
For starters, the character names. They fit really well with the characters themselves. First up - Kubrick Fear. As stated in the synopsis, she is basically a torture machine in the form of a girl; Fear. Her actual form, and primary weapon would be the &#039;cube&#039;. Kubrick being &#039;Cube&#039; and &#039;Brick&#039;.. get it?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45759">
        Get it?! :D<br />
<br />
&#039;Yachi Haruaki&#039;, the main male protagonist in the story. &quot;Yachi&quot; in Japanese means fortune, or good luck. I&#039;d have to concur, as Haruaki claims that curses do NOT affect him whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The plot is fantastic and original. Materializing &#039;torture&#039; machines to do away with your opponents. And the way they are summoned and the incantation (in my opinion) is way cool! It is not your typical &#039;Swordfight&#039; anime or &#039;Trigger-happy&#039; anime. It gives a medieval feel, because torture machines were created way back when they were necessary for interrogations.<br />
<br />
I always thought Muramasa Konoha (I never noticed her surname, &#039;Muramasa&#039; until now) was only going to be the typical USELESS (emphasis on useless) &#039;big-breasted&#039; friend who would always try to steal the main character away from the female protagonist (references to Yoshida from &#039;Shakugan no Shana&#039;, and Siesta from &#039;Zero no Tsukaima&#039;). I was horribly mistaken... SHE CAN TRANSFORM INTO A FREAKING SWORD! I should have seen that coming, though; her last name is &#039;Muramasa&#039;.<br />
<br />
The Opening song is pleasant to the ears. It kind of reminds me of something out of CLANNAD, or Touhou. I found Fear&#039;s dance really cute and charming.<br />
<br />
I said I was going to be unbiased, but that was a lie. I have a fetish for tsunderes (although, you know who you tsundere-fans are!), and Fear is an ADORABLE one. Her actions, her expressions, her love for food. Wow. 10/10<br />
<br />
On top of the vocal/musical masterpieces, we have visual artwork. I really like how the eyes were done in this Anime, and also I like how Fear&#039;s hair shines rainbow. It&#039;s very appealing to the eyes, in my humble opinion.<br />
<br />
Character development is a big one. Unlike other animes, where they pour all this information on you (most of the information being irrelevant or useless), Cube x Cursed x Curious slowly thickens the plot, and distributes background information on each character at a nice pace. Right now, we know very crucial details about Fear, Haruaki, and Konoha that help us digest the story a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this anime 10/10!

    I&#039;m writing this because episode one does not reflect the pure awesomeness that is episode two. It almost feels like they made that first episode the way it is because they wanted to make what follows somewhat shocking and completely unexpected. <br />
<br />
And job well done. I was not expecting that at all. I&#039;ll let you all discover what it is on your own, i wont say anything more.<br />
<br />
Episode one was just fan service. A naked Fear, and a multitude of panty-shots and comedic silliness that doesn&#039;t really do what follows justice at all. Thats why i think it was there to give a false indication

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45685">
        of what to expect. <br />
<br />
This is really shaping up to be an interesting series. The artwork is great, one redeeming factor of the first episode, blasting purples and blues and all sorts of radiance in every shot. The girls are cute but for that first episodes are just empty shells of what they turn out to be. Loli-jealousy of the girl with the big boobs and things. You get the idea. <br />
<br />
Either way, i did enjoy the first episode, don&#039;t get me wrong. But the second episode is brilliant in comparison. It starts off the same way as the first but it escalates into something much bigger, very quickly. Give it a watch.

    Starting off as a comedy and, then, getting total serious and violent, this was surely an unique experience... We can see Fear as a clumsy girl on the entire first episode, destroying everything on Haruaki&#039;s house. However, things get more interesting as her true nature is shown right on the next episode: a killing machine...<br />
<br />
Gattering all pain and suffer caused by the Inquisiton and turning that into a human with feelings and the sole desire to forget her past, Fear is &quot;delivered&quot; to Haruaki as a cube, sent by his weird father. Maybe he already knew Haruaki would be able to help her out, as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117865">
        he was born with some kind of &quot;curse resistance&quot; and also lives on a sanctuary, a symbol of mind peace and tranquility...<br />
<br />
Still, would Fear be able lock her bloodthirsty alter ego and turn herself into a good person? First step is forgetting about killing people... Tough matter, as others try to pursue her... So, she has to count on her new friends to help with that and with her overall &quot;rehabilitation&quot; as well...<br />
<br />
Visually gorgeous, CxCxC uses every possible animation trick to improve enjoyment. Short, special cutscenes, everyone of them with an unique style, are simply amazing! Overall design may look basic, but reminds of classic visual novels, those where characters had even bigger eyes, that attract me so much... It also features two different OP/ED themes, despite being 12 episodes long... I had never seen a short anime where that happened... Moreover, we get the chance to see some of the most famous torture tools ever used by humankind, redesigned... Fantastic!<br />
<br />
There are few characters, but more are introduced on last episode&#039;s ending, giving strong hopes for a new season in the future. Just like a VN, characters don&#039;t differ to much from each other on appearance matters, they all have the same base design... Still, they have their own personalities, some really awkward...<br />
<br />
Fear is a kind of metaphor, cleverly created to show us that even the most despicable being, responsible for many people&#039;s suffering and death, is able to get complete forgiveness after paying for his sins and, by helping others and showing appreciation for those who helped him. We all make mistakes, some of them may seem unforgivable... We are imperfect, but anyone can change... That&#039;s the main lesson taken from CxCxC...

Brief review: For those who don&#039;t wish to spend too much time reading other peoples thoughts.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10: Nothing ground breaking. I don&#039;t really care much if it has been done before... but the story just doesn&#039;t flow too nicely.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10: The art was good. I liked the art. A number of scenes are used a few times too many. The effects where nice but i feel that if they added a bit more variation to the &quot;OOO SHINY!! OOO SPARKLY!!&quot; thing going on every time someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49515">
        grabs a weapon, things may have turned out better.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10: The seiyuu did a lovely job with the characters voices. Although many sound effects sound slightly out of place and the OP &amp; ED&#039;s don&#039;t seem to fit well with the anime, i think the sound was just fine.<br />
<br />
Characters 6/10: Cliche? Not a problem. Uninteresting, predictable and unnecessary... kind of a problem.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10: I had fun for the majority of the episodes... the last few ones felt really rushed and made less and less sense with each passing minute. Needs a season two to clear things up and fix the story.<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10: Give this anime a go if you&#039;ve got time to spend on a mediocre anime. It&#039;s nothing to awesome, but if you find yourself incapable of thinking then this anime might be the one for you.<br />
<br />
Not so brief review: Just the above with lots more words really. May contain some spoilers if you haven&#039;t watched episode 1 :3<br />
<br />
Lets start with LE GENRE TAGS!!!<br />
First up we have action, CHECK!<br />
Then we have comedy, Check... nothing that will genuinely make you laugh, but you might crack a smile here and there.<br />
Next up is Ecchi, check.<br />
SCHOOL!!! Check!<br />
Shounen, a big fat check! <br />
<br />
Looks like thats covered. Some might want to add &quot;romance&quot; but i urge them to rethink that decision. <br />
<br />
SO! C3, aka CubexCursedxCurios, is an anime that stars Konata Izumi-errr- Fear Kubrick who is an ancient...box... Yes, a BOX. She is an ancient tool of slaughtery and murdery (those are, from today onwards, official words) who was sent to this boy-who-happens-to-be-very-good-and-cant-be-affected-by-curses-cause-hes-good-or-something by his dad. His dad is an explorer/adventurer type thing that sends him cursed items (like the BOX) so they may rid themselves of their curse. This is the story.<br />
Thats kinda boring eh? Well, no worries. Stuff happens. <br />
How does stuff happen you might ask... well... random people show up and cause random problems and then they get their ass handed to them. WHOA! How... interesting... Well... no. The problem with random people showing up is that the story doesn&#039;t progress on it&#039;s own anymore. Our main characters apparently cant provide the necessary drive to move on with the MAIN PURPOSE of whatever it is they are trying to do (removing curses from cursed objects like a BOX).<br />
Random people appear and force the story to move forward. Is that a problem? Not if it was necessary... Is it necessary? No... <br />
I won&#039;t go on and on about this... The story has some very good potential that is wasted because it rushes a lot. For a 12 episode anime, rushing never solves anything.<br />
<br />
Ok... lets leave the story for at that... ON TO LE CHARACTERS!<br />
<br />
Lets start with the star of the show, Konata izu--- FEAR KUBRICK. Fear, or Fear-in-cube (said in english, not japanese. Pronounced Fe-a - een - Quu-beh) is a device, or box, of pain and suffering. She is good at killing stuff. <br />
&quot;Hey stooorm!!! why do you keep referring to a box as she!?&quot; Well my dear imaginary reader, that is because this BOX has developed a human form... with emotions et al. Yes, she is practically a human.<br />
 So she is sent to this boy, yuuchi haruki, whom we will talk about later. Anywayz, so fear is a cursed object. She is sent to this boy so that she may live as a normal human and lift the curse. Her favorite phrase happens to be &quot;I&#039;ll curse you!&quot; Interesting character yea? Seriously, its actually interesting for 1 episode... how much does her character develop? not much... not much at all... BUT!!! shes the only one who really develops. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, now we have our good guy. Yuuchi haruki is a kid who cant get cursed. Whoooo. He&#039;s our sweety pie. Our needle in a haystack. How does he develop? Not in any particular way. His dad sends him cursed objects (i&#039;d love it if my dad sent me any kind of objects, cursed or otherwise...) and yuuchi helps them lift their curse. Thats it. We find out why he indulges in his dads antics early in the anime and its nothing special, btw no info on the dad. <br />
<br />
Next we have Muramasa Konata. She is... well... take a look at her name, you&#039;ll know what she is. Oh, she is labelled as Ms. Cow tits by Fear... cause you know... her udder is easily accessible-ERR, her boobs are big. She is kind and likes yuuchi... Oh, she also has a slightly darker side that she shows to Fear... but theres a silly reason for that. Her character doesn&#039;t develop either. Really... thats it... the highlight of this MAIN CHARACTER is her tits. That is all... i guess big boobs do get you all the good jobs...<br />
<br />
SO, last character is the sadomasochist... she also likes a certain someone and helps him out. Shes starts off all secret agent like but then sorta gets closer and keeps less secrets. Does her character develop? Only if revealing secrets count. <br />
<br />
We still have a few, just a few, more characters involved... but they are introduced fairy late in the anime for us to give a shit about.<br />
 They seem to want to play a big part in the story, but they just come in so late that we simply cant appreciate their company. This includes the baddies who appear and disappear randomly. Them baddies don&#039;t seem to serve any particular reason other than to agitate the story. Sigh... all in all, the characters aren&#039;t something you&#039;d remember and think &quot;ah, arent they special&quot; in a good way.<br />
<br />
Ok ok... ART TIME!!! <br />
LE ART IS LE GOOD! Seriously, the art is nice. Movements are fluid, a nice number of backgrounds and a few scenes are very detailed and really add to the feel of the anime. Characters are nicely drawn, abit too moe moe, but still very nicely drawn. Weapons looks kinda funky, and it is that funkyness that prevents me from giving this a perfect score. They could have done much much better and added some nice variations... but meh, oh well. an 8/10 is still very very good in my book!<br />
<br />
SOUND TIME!!! <br />
Not Le great... just good. Characters have a nice matching seiyuu that really helps bring them to life. I gave it a low score because i really didn&#039;t feel that the OP&#039;s &amp; ED&#039;s matched the anime and the sound effects were really bland.  Nothing fantastic, but atleast its decent enough to not make me want to stick a pencil in my left ear. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment! Better off watching porn. <br />
I managed to somehow enjoy this anime till it got near the last 3 eps. It felt like it was going to become a hopeless rat race to the finish... and it did. It really stopped me from appreciating all the work and effort, or lack thereof, put into the anime. <br />
<br />
Final Score 6/10: I&#039;d suggest you go watch this when your brain needs a break from all the thinking. If the anime just sort of said &quot;here deal with what is happening&quot; i would really not be able to even recommend it (that would be cruel) but since it actually shows us what is happening, it doesn&#039;t fail miserably. It could have been much better with a few more episodes... and i really dislike the horrible ending because they are just teasing us with more plot holes... they seem to want to make a 2nd season pretty badly... oh well... a semi-decent watch nonetheless.<br />
<br />
I hope you found my review helpful or at the very least enjoyable!<br />

    Curses, curses, curses--there are certainly a large number of anime having centered their plots around some sort of curse, whether it be part of a major story arc or even the axis of which the story turns. So, what makes C3 (otherwise known as &quot;CubexCursedxCurious&quot;) different from all the rest? Well, putting this as frankly as I can, C3 tries to make everything about its story center around the idea, methodology, and practice of curses, but instead, its brain-scattering plot, absolutely tragic pacing, and tired, stereotypical characters make what could have been an interesting plot into something degrading and lousy.<br />
<br />
Starting-off with the opening song, all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49481">
        I can say is that its appropriate enough, but very standard. It&#039;s a studio-done song, so, as one can imagine, Yukari Tamura, the voice of the main character of this show, is singing with musical accompaniment. However, while the opening song itself is fine, I can&#039;t say the same for the visuals; frankly, they&#039;re completely pointless, add nothing to the overall plot, and leave the audience in the dark as to what they&#039;re in for. I can only guess as to why Silver Link decided to do this: because they wanted to go for shock value. What sort of &quot;shock value&quot;?<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the long answer:<br />
<br />
Fear Kubrick is a cubic entity that has been used for generations as a tool for torture and killing; she is essentially the active hive for torture devices and cursed objects. Understandably, after seeing so much pain for as long as she&#039;s existed, Fear wishes to simply live among the humans--not as a killing machine, but as a kind, gentle person who gives back to others with respect. Haruaki Yachi is one such person who can help Fear to reach her goal, as she is quite literally delivered at his doorstep (initially, in her cubic form); he holds a gift that allows himself to be unafflicted by curses. However, Fear&#039;s journey to enlightenment will not come without its fair share of trials and consequences, as not only are there deadly organizations that wish to utilize her power, but there is also the berserk nature inside herself that is always pushing to come out.<br />
<br />
But, for anyone who doesn&#039;t care for any of that, here&#039;s the short answer:<br />
<br />
Fanservice, fanservice, fanservice--oh, and there&#039;s some fighting, too! The fighting&#039;s pretty neat--oh, and there&#039;s some blabbing about curses and pretentious bull, but that&#039;s not important. Ooo, look! There&#039;s lots of blood and gore and yandere-type crazy faces mixed-in as well! I know certain Higurashi fans out there that will love this!<br />
<br />
As for the cast, there&#039;s Fear, the sorta-kinda-tsundere cube girl, Konoha, the glasses chick with huge knockers, and Haruaki, the chillin&#039; dude with a heart of gold; there&#039;s also Kirika, the class president who--and I must admit--isn&#039;t really all that important to the story, except for maybe one or two episodes, but certainly not the conclusion. Anyway, I&#039;m glad to see that the cardboard cut-outs are all accounted for, and if that&#039;s not enough, there&#039;s plenty more of them later on--more breasts, a loli, MORE breasts. Perfect./sarcasm<br />
<br />
Yes, one of the issues with C3 is that it can get extreme in many departments--with its violence, with its drama, with its fanservice; but, that&#039;s just the one brick in this cubic disaster, as this leads me to explaining the show&#039;s true issue. I can deal with some violence, I can deal with sappy drama and ridiculous amounts of ecchi service, but what is it that makes this whole show really fall to pieces?<br />
<br />
C3&#039;s pacing is ATROCIOUS. Period.<br />
<br />
This show doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be, and even when it does, it&#039;s all over the place. Sometimes, C3 is a cute, adorable, light-hearted, romantic-comedy romp--as with its first episode; other times, C3 is a bloody, gruesome, violent, dramatic mish-mash of pretension and battling--as with its second and third episodes. If all of those descriptive words were too much and/or too sweeping in terms of genre, that&#039;s my point exactly. In fact, to hammer this point in even further, take a look at MAL&#039;s genres listing for this show, and then take a look at its rating. Doesn&#039;t really mesh well, right?<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the speed of which this anime attempts to cram its plot together in twelve episodes is astonishingly bad; understandably, this can be a somewhat prominent issue with shows that are twelve episodes or less due to time constraints, but C3 takes the problem leaps and bounds forward. The show goes through three, separate villains; a number of extensive fight scenes, some taking at least half of an episode; full episodes devoted to &quot;rom-com&quot; material; several-minute-long comedic scenes; time spent on philosophical dialogue; flashbacks, back-stories, and long, expository monologues--<br />
<br />
Phew! Give me time to breathe, please!<br />
<br />
Granted, if the show hadn&#039;t gone for blatant sequel-baiting at the end of its run, I would have just chalked this up as Silver Link trying to fit too much material from the original light novels into too little time--for example, sort of like Chaos;Head. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst offenders I&#039;ve ever seen of becoming a completely crushed and compressed product, but that&#039;s only about four-fifths of this cube analogy. What about the final piece?<br />
<br />
For those who don&#039;t know of Silver Link&#039;s origin, here&#039;s a little history lesson:<br />
<br />
Director Shin Oonuma, the director of both the much-beloved Baka to Test and this, once worked as a director of many of the earlier projects in another studio--SHAFT, which is now famous for their much later work, such as Zetsubou Sensei, Bakemonogatari, and, of course, Madoka Magica. He eventually split-off from them to help form Silver Link, but my guess is Mr. Oonuma knew the guy who did the trippy, layered artwork used in all three of those shows and decided to replicate what he had seen to be used in one of his own anime.<br />
<br />
In fact, why stop there? Why not just be like SHAFT entirely, using all sorts of weird, seemingly out-of-place imagery? Apparently, Mr. Oonuma didn&#039;t understand the imagery he had seen in SHAFT&#039;s latest work, and the result was... well, even more things for me to complain about, in terms of this show not knowing what it wants to be.<br />
<br />
All sorts of symbols are used, different art styles can be seen--heck, they might as well even use the old-style camera start-up trick that SHAFT has used a lot at the beginning of several of their anime (including Zetsubou Sensei, Vampire Bund, Madoka, etc.). None of this is able to stand up on its own, though; it just makes C3 look like its going for gimmicks rather than actual substance.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, I can safely say that when the art is normal and without any of the gimmicks, it&#039;s actually pretty visually appealing; it&#039;s colorful, it&#039;s cute, and keeps what would have been an otherwise even worse show from being completely disappointing. The soundtrack, too, does its job and isn&#039;t all that bad, but it isn&#039;t all that remarkable, either.<br />
<br />
Without making this review much longer, I will conclude by saying that if the pacing wasn&#039;t so incredibly distracting as being the absolute worst item about this show, C3 would at least be mediocre. Heck, Fear is actually demoted from the main heroine to comedic relief after just over two-thirds of the series is up; because of this and everything else I have already mentioned, the pacing is simply inexcusable. C3 tries so hard to be something memorable like its older sister, Baka to Test, but it falls short of nearly every target; the story is too jumbled, the characters don&#039;t bear any staying power, and it overshoots by aiming arrogantly in the face of what made series prior to its creation work so well. What? Did a child write this?<br />
<br />
Precisely, C3 is the equivalent of a kid who thinks too highly of himself and steals candy from adults instead of babies within the anime world; it just ends up choking on some Sour Skittles just before getting a good slap on its bottom. Now, if I could be excused for a moment, I have a Rubik&#039;s Cube to go play with~

    Short or mid size reviews are best, nn tl;dr.<br />
<br />
Once again we are rained down upon from the Japanese animation industry with a new series of adaptations and stand alone projects. The last few seasons we were graced by some greats such as Ano Hana, Steins Gate, and Usagi Drop; shows that showed nothing special but proved themselves with a above excellent plot scheme or brilliant story telling. I have to admit im still in the phase of watching anything that looks remotely interesting in each new season line up and I can say I have had some negative and positive experiences.<br />
<br />
C³ - CubexCursedxCurious was a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46375">
        series I put my eyes on this season just because I needed to fill the void. My first impression was that this was just another ecchi/shounen combo(these rarely work out) but as the episodes went it progressed. Although the series itself is not finished it does have potential to become a decent show. My rating for this is open book mainly because a series can really only be rated at the following points: Beginning, middle, and end hence so many drops at the start air of any show.<br />
<br />
Story wise there is no evidence of any real exposure of full plot, this looks like it may follow a traditional plot sequence and I hope it does. The art is more computer look a like with the cube animations that are thrown in, minus the boob bouncing or slashing events its nothing that I would consider special. The sound effects are generic and bland, of course sound is I mean we hear so much everyday its impossible to filter everything out. The characters again are nothing special minus Fear Cube which really is the only thing keeping me gripped while I watch this.<br />
<br />
If you like being first in line for a show you might just pick this up, but be warned do not expect greatness until its finished.

    For a long time I have had an odd relationship with the anime &quot;C3&quot; also known by the much longer title &quot;CubexCursexCurious.&quot; It took me three tries to actually motivate myself to watch this anime: on my first attempt a year ago I managed to make it through the first 3 minutes of the first episode; then on my second attempt a month later, I made it through the entire first episode; and then, just this past week, I managed to watch the remaining 11 episodes. My conclusion, C3 has one of the absolute worst and most misleading first episodes of any show I have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120667">
        ever come across. Not that the anime really improves much throughout the rest of the show, but it&#039;s at least a slight improvement.<br />
<br />
What the first episode implies that this show will be is a very lighthearted, ecchi, comedic (albeit idiotic and not funny at all) anime about a humanoid weapon (who of course looks like a young girl) as she discovers the wonders of the human world from television to the warmth of human interaction. Episode 3 turns the entire lighthearted atmosphere upside down and shows that this anime can also have a VERY dark atmosphere at times. However, the show is inconsistent with that atmosphere and it comes and goes so much that it loses most of its effect.<br />
<br />
Anyway, onto the story. The show begins with our generic &quot;help everyone else before myself&quot; protagonist named Haruaki (voiced by Yuki Kaji). One day, an odd package from his father arrives at his house where he lives alone. This box is no ordinary box as it is impenetrable and baffles Haruaki to the point where he just decides to leave it alone. But, the box ends up turning into our flat-chested, energetic female protagonist named Fear. Haruaki then proceeds to go through the fastest acceptance of a strange supernatural girl appearing at his house I have ever seen. It makes some sense since it turns out that his tsundere childhood friend, Konoha, is also the same kind of &quot;cursed weapon&quot; as Fear. The rest of the first episode consists of Fear being left alone in Haruaki&#039;s house while the other two go to school (what a great idea) and it just follows Fear as she discovers different things about the world.<br />
<br />
After that, the actual plot begins and we find out more about what Fear and Konoha are and about the curses that go along with them. However for a reason that is never explained, Haruaki is immune to these curses which allows him to fight with Konoha (who can become a sword) without suffering the consequences like most people would. The story never really focuses on one objective and in the end, is in dire need of a second season as it keeps introducing characters right up until the end credits of the last episode. The different plots tend to focus on different characters like Fear, another girl who is Haruaki&#039;s class president named Kirika, and a few other minor characters who aren&#039;t Konoha because she never gets to be a focal character despite being a main character. The series also has very poor villains who only stick around for a few episodes at a time and more annoyed me than anything else.<br />
<br />
The animation and soundtrack are some of the better aspects of this show. The first opening is actually what interested me in the anime originally (before the first episode killed that interest twice) and the first ending is a beautiful ballad which stands above most generic ballad ending songs in my opinion. The show switches openings and endings later in the show (despite this being only 12 episodes) and neither really impressed me as much as the first ones. The second opening puts focus on Kirika rather than Fear despite that never actually happening in the show.<br />
<br />
The characters&#039; designs are good but none really stand out all that much. Fear is your typical flat-chested girl, Konoha (aka &quot;Cow Tits&quot;) is the busty girl who Fear envies, and Kirika looks like your typical &quot;mature girl&quot; on the &quot;outside.&quot; The characters also wear their school uniforms about 75% of the time. To top it all off, I have no idea why they would have a villain who wears clothes that make her look like a nun (she&#039;s not one in case you&#039;re wondering), but they did. Most of the action scenes look great, especially the VERY dark ones, however, there are some moments where things (like smoke in the background of a fight) seem a little awkwardly animated. There are also some moments where the show tries its hand at some more surreal animation tricks like making a clock tick and appear every so often during a speech or showing a character on a white background with only their shadow around them. I generally like things like this, but this show did not know how to time them correctly and they just ended up as random moments where the animation sometimes even contradicted how the characters were feeling.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack, aside from what I mentioned before, is good but nothing outstanding. It&#039;s pretty forgettable especially during the lighthearted scenes and only makes itself noticeable during some of the darker fights.<br />
<br />
&quot;C3&quot; is a great example of an anime that didn&#039;t know what it wanted to be. It tries to be a lighthearted high school comedy, a VERY dark psychological action story, a story about how humans really aren&#039;t as bad as they may seem, a story of redemption (which ties into the dark one as well), etc. It introduces and then moves on from its poor villains.....I would say too quickly for development but I was glad when they were finally gone. The main characters have hardly any development, the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; organizations are never explained, what exactly these &quot;cursed weapons&quot; are and why Haruaki is immune to their curses are never explained, and the show ends crying out for a second season by showing a few new characters right at the very end. Considering it came out two years ago and doesn&#039;t seem to be very well received, I do not expect it to receive a second season. On that note, I would recommend passing on &quot;C3,&quot; and only watch the great first opening and ending if you think you can avoid getting interested in watching this way below average anime.

    If you like cute character,a little bit of harem story,and romance included with some actions, this anime is perfect for you. I recommend you to watch this show.<br />
<br />
Storyline:<br />
At first glance, I can predict what will happens next to Fear Kubrick as the story is alike &quot;Dragon Crisis&quot;.Some sort of crazy power hidden in the main protagonist (Fear Kubrick) then there is battle scene and I think it is a story with a lot of theme variation and it was good for a story. The story started with a peaceful scene which is enjoyed to watch,and there is no lines that could make you confused at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45887">
        all.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I think the art is extremely good,I give 9/10 for it. You could notice some catchy effect in the episodes,I thinks its new for me.Furthermore, the art is the major succes factor of this anime since it has a lot of unique animation variation packed throughout the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Umm,The sound. As long as I enjoyed the anime,the sound must be good as well.Right music choices and some pianos melody all placed in the right scenes. But the things that interest me the most is the main theme song of the anime &quot;Endless Story&quot; by Tamura Yukari(Fear Kubrick voice actor).<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
If you&#039;re fan of short female protagonist,such as Shana(Shakugan No Shana), You will definetly love this anime as well. Male Protagonist, has some sort of cool character,caring and so on.Fear Kubrick is cute (In my opinion),and her action is such a normal kid,loves to play,naughty and so on.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Ahh...I really enjoyed this story. Look for yourself.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
This story reminds me of Kugimiya Rie anime characters,Shana,Rose,Louise and Nagi but this time,Its  Tamura Yukari Turns. I&#039;m sure you will love this anime, and I dont want to talk much more,just watch it and feel free to tell me how is it!<br />
<br />
P/S: This review based on my own understanding and all from my perspective.

    C3... At first i thought it would turn out to be yet another generic harem/ecchi anime. Well, it still turned out to be a generic harem/ecchi anime (in my opinion), but the direction it took really surprised me.<br />
<br />
The first episode did not set a very good base for the whole series. It felt nothing like the other 11 episodes that followed. My first thought when i saw episode 2/3 was &quot;What the heck?? Oh god is this going to turn out like Elfen Lied or something?&quot;. Well with Elfen lied, they atleast had the decency to show just how whacked out the series was in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71349">
        the first episode. C3 hides it until around the third episode which is very misleading and just bad planning in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The only reason i even gave this anime a shot was because i didn&#039;t have that many new anime that i wanted to watch. I was already hesitant to continue after the first few episodes, but i went and finished the whole series anyways. Let me just say that it was more or less what i expected it to be, boring and full of fanservice (not in the good way).<br />
<br />
The art is probably the only thing that stopped me from dropping this anime after each episode i watched. The fight scenes were pretty well done (especially the last one). It was really good of course because the studio that made it was Silver Link (Baka to test ftw), but it is quite sad when that is really the only thing keeping the viewers from dropping it.<br />
<br />
The music was nice as well. The opening song , Curios, was one of those few openings that i wouldn&#039;t skip over every episode. It was nice and soothing, and the OSTs were pretty well done as well.<br />
<br />
The characters... there is not much to say about them. They stay pretty static throughout the whole series and are quite boring. If i had to say, the two most interesting character are probably Kirika Ningyouhara (side character/part of the harem) and Peavey Barowi (pyscho villain). Interesting does not mean i like them though.<br />
<br />
When i first read the synopsis for C3, i thought it was quite interesting. It was still a bit interesting when i watched it, but i felt that it was very badly portrayed in the anime. I find myself forgetting what the story is about from one episode to another. In the end, it seems like they just wanted to rush through and finish the anime. <br />
<br />
The ending left me very unsatisfied and i felt like i just wasted a few hours of my life. They were probably trying to get people to read the light novel, but i probably won&#039;t be doing it. This show overall did not keep me very entertained with its mediocre story line, but it was still decent enough for me to push through and finish it. I would recommend watching this only if you have nothing else to do, or if you are very Curios about it.<br />

    Goodness gracious, this is one delicious shit sandwich... Might as well get right down to it...<br />
<br />
Story - 4<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure what the damn story is. This is just one of those animes, packed with such random shit and dialogue, to make sure it looks as dramatic and dark as possible. Gimmick here Gimmick there. It manages to leave me feeling like an idiot, wondering whether I was too stupid to understand what it was trying to tell me or that it really wasn&#039;t trying to say anything at all. It&#039;s a mess, a big mess. It confuses you...<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a good plot, go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49911">
        elsewhere. You have better chances of being served a Big Mac at Burger King for your retarded ass.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least the art was good.&quot;<br />
<br />
There it is. That excuse. And yes, there is absolutely nothing to say against it. I watched this crap for the art. Boy was the animation spectacular. Random yes, interesting? Of course. Awesome compared to the garbage art I&#039;ve seen in my day. At least it had this.<br />
<br />
If they only had put as much effort into the damn story than they did the art. I would have agreed to have middle grade art in exchange for a good story, that made sense.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6<br />
<br />
All that noise... OP and ED, did not capture my interests nor my attention.<br />
<br />
Characters - 6<br />
<br />
Shallow, underdeveloped, unrelatable. You won&#039;t be crying if any of them died. Nope, not even the slightest change in facial expression. Sure I kind of liked some of them, but not enough to go into detail in this review.<br />
<br />
Alright... one word. Bondage.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
<br />
I was wiping the drool off my table every time I finished an episode. Not because I was too engrossed to keep my mouth closed, but because I did not give a shit about what happened next and was blankly staring at the subs waiting for it to end or for something interesting to happen.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5<br />
<br />
Remember that sandwich I mentioned at the start of this review?<br />
<br />
The art was good, but now that I think about it, there really isn&#039;t such a thing as a delicious shit sandwich is there? Good art or not, I have other animes piled up that are willing to and able to give me more, for less suffering.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------tl;dr?-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Do not waste your time. Unless you want to appreciate the art with a Blue Ray copy which I feel is a complete waste of resources in itself.

       This is just my first impression based on the first episode, so my opinions on this series are subject to change.<br />
So in the first episode our protagonist Haruaki Yachi is sent a box from his relative, which can transform into a beautiful tsundere girl. It&#039;s then revealed that she is basically the living manifestation of the negative emotions people give off, which might explain why she is tsundere in the first place. <br />
<br />
Ok...I&#039;m interested.<br />
  <br />
  I don&#039;t really think that one can get an overall feel on what the rest of the anime will be like from just the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44699">
        episode, but that&#039;s not to say you can&#039;t get anything from it. From this, I&#039;ve taken it that the plot is unique from others, and therefore, I&#039;m interested. I mean, it&#039;s not everyday you hear a show has a girl that can transform into a box. <br />
   <br />
   The artwork and animation is also praiseworthy, much better than I expected, even. It&#039;s graceful animation and colorful backgrounds are pleasing to the eye.<br />
   <br />
   The sound effects are nothing special, but nothing bad either.    <br />
   <br />
   The characters, however, are what make this review suffer greatly. There is nothing from them that makes them stand out because they are overly cliche types that can be found in many other animes. The childish-but-in-a-cute-way tsundere. And the pushover male lead who puts up with her, and conveniently lives alone. The only character who has some depth in their stereotype in Yachi&#039;s friend Konoha. She appears to be just some other &quot;glasses-girl&quot; type of girl who is kind and caring toward him, but she can also be quite the snappy kind of girl, who won&#039;t hesitate to make a remark back when insulted, but it seems she&#039;s won&#039;t even be a lead character.<br />
<br />
   Overall, so far I&#039;d give this series a 7/10, because of the interest it&#039;s peaked in me with it&#039;s art and plot, and because of the overly used elements. I&#039;ll continue to view a few other episodes and see if it&#039;s something that can use it&#039;s potential to the fullest, or be another anime that&#039;s so focused on being cute, eye candy that it sacrifices the storyline.

    Boy meets girl. Actually, he finds her naked in his house. His female childhood friend is upset about it, but still despite that he takes the poor thing in. How cliché is that?<br />
<br />
Well, if that&#039;s exactly what you thought when watching the first few minutes of C3, you&#039;re pretty much entirely... WRONG!<br />
<br />
Having seen some of the more popular series, I can tell which shows tend to be serious about their plots and which are really trying to ridicule the overused stuff. So here comes the shocking conclusion I&#039;ve come to: C3 is in fact mostly a PARODY!<br />
<br />
When you realise that, you can cheerfully laugh at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45461">
        how the protagonist, Haruaki, is never even the slightest bit surprised about anything or how his friend, Konoha, instantly becomes hostile towards the stray metal-cube-girl: Fear, who has yet to learn what TV is and how a washing machine works.<br />
<br />
Believe me, if you take on such a point of view and go through to the second episode... Its subtle style of parody mixed with pure epicness will blow your brains out. What&#039;s more – I have a strong feeling it&#039;s gonna get even better.<br />
<br />
Did I mention C3 also has a really pleasant visual style? Nice music and good voice acting?<br />
<br />
Do you actually need anything more to truly enjoy a show...?<br />
<br />
Give it a try and remember: it&#039;s not serious! It&#039;s comedy!

    C³ (CubexCursedxCurious) has a lot of potential despite being an ecchi. The anime as a whole definitely could have been much better if it wasn&#039;t limited to being only 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
STORY: 6.5/10<br />
<br />
The story is based around the main male protagonist, Yachi Haruaki. He lives alone and away from his father who goes around the world searching for cursed weapons that have been used to kill. His father sends these cursed weapons back home to where Haruaki lives in which his role is to remove that curse and lead those cursed weapons who takes the form of a human onto a different path. He does this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49029">
        by being optimistic, positive, and supportive of these characters in how they want to change who they previously were while putting his life on the line.<br />
<br />
Fear Kubrick is main female protagonist that is first introduced as a cursed weapon. She has two personalities; one being her past killer self and the other being her regretful, self-conscious self. She is timid, but also aggressive most of the time. While she may not show it, she is really concerned about her friends especially Haruaki. <br />
<br />
As the story progresses, more characters are introduced, and relationships develop between them and Haruaki. <br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ story/plot viewpoint ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
I may have not seen the all the episodes of C³ so my opinion might change, but I do know where the anime is heading. The exposition of the story started off really well in the first episode, but then it completely changed its course in the second episode. The change was so drastic that I felt it was really difficult to actually grasp the idea and concept of the storyline. The setting and characters were barely introduced and yet we have already arrived into the rising action of the plot in the second episode. The problem could have been easily remedied if the producers had extended the amount of episodes for better development to the plot.<br />
<br />
ART: 10/10<br />
<br />
The art is stunningly beautiful. My jaw dropped as I was watching the first episode; the ocean currents sparkled and the sky glimmered. The graphics in all the scenery, battles, opening and ending (EVERYTHING) are of the highest quality. Although I am not a fan of ecchi, the art makes it acceptable and respectable. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 9/10<br />
<br />
The voices of the voice actors fit the characters really well. The opening and ending songs are accompanied by the dazzling art. BGM and sound effects were all used effectively and at the right time.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
The main potential of C³ lied behind the characters, but with the short amount of episodes, we were limited in character development. Most of the main characters&#039; background that was portrayed in the anime were shown in one episode or less. The changes that they all undergo happens far too quick in which it leaves the viewer filled with unanswered questions. This contributes to a lack of a good plot which narrows down to poor overall development between the story and characters.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 7/10<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t quite enjoy the plot, but most of the other aspects of this anime were satisfying. I would recommend it to a friend who has time to run through an ecchi anime that has a few holes in its plot and semi-poor development.
