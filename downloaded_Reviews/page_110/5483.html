    Before I start this review I must start by saying Bayonetta is easily <br />
one of my Favorite over the top action adventure games EVA!! <br />
<br />
This movie i feel is for those who have mainly played the game bayonetta. if you have not, It might not be worth seeing this. <br />
Anyhow, seeing that there was an anime based on the game i was worried at first, that is until i got the chance to watch it. <br />
<br />
The Movie for the most part was quite fun. <br />
however Not as fun as playing the actual game though.<br />
For those who have play the game Bayonetta you&#039;ll will be pleased

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142127">
        to know that they have incorporated the characters and some of the soundtracks from the actual game to make this feel like the game itself. but does it live up to it?<br />
<br />
Story - 5<br />
Yes it is a bizarre story. <br />
( The Prologue )<br />
In the remote part of Europe is a place called Vigrid where there lies the observers of history,  Among them are 2 Main organizations they are known as Umbra witches (representing Darkness) they known to be in league with demons and the Lumen sages (representing light) who ally themselves with the angels. <br />
These 2 organizations were protectors in charge of keeping the right balance of the world between the 2 however that decree was suddenly violated by one witch and one sage that bound them together producing a child.  <br />
The witch was imprisoned and the sage was banished. It was An entity between light and darkness was said to bring calamity to the world and now the legend was finally about to be realized however &#039;you guessed it&#039; this starts a war between angels and demons that then soon fades into the obscure dormant of history, That is only the beginning.<br />
<br />
Now in the present day we start with a journalist named Luka, <br />
investigating a mysterious woman who he seems to hold a personal grudge against. <br />
That women is Bayonetta. We follow the story of the witch known as Bayonetta, as she defeats these crazy ass blood-thirsty Angels in her path and tries to remember her past from before the time she was awaken 20 years ago along with some of the other characters like Enzo bayonetta&#039;s information broker, Jeanne Bayonetta&#039;s closest rival, Rodin a renowned demon weapons dealer as well as a bartender, Cereza a mysterious little girl and of course Luka.<br />
<br />
Characters - 7<br />
Simply put the characters are exactly who they are in the game and nothing more <br />
which is a plus.<br />
<br />
Bayonetta is one of the Coolest, Sexiest, unadulterated all-out protagonist in video gaming in my opinion, She displays this in her nicely stylish long black hair and librarian glasses with such a lovely, enticing, witty attitude and her Epic abilities and powers which to me easily gets a thumbs up. all of the other supporting characters are in this as well and they too represent themselves as they are in the game which is Good, <br />
The Downside is do not watch this anime for character development because there isn&#039;t to be honest. After all it is based of a crazy hack n&#039; slash video game after all despite the lack of enemies, bosses and mad situations that happens compared to the game itself.<br />
<br />
Art - 6<br />
I am not that much of a fan of Gonzo from their previous anime productions, <br />
The art style was nice don&#039;t get me wrong. Its just for me, the action scenes however<br />
were not animated that well unfortunately <br />
which is why I don&#039;t usually favor Gonzo animation that much,<br />
I thought the CG backdrops were used poorly within this film as it stood out while it should of blended into the background even with the use of some blood in the scenes <br />
which they tried to make it seem like its Hardcore popcorn fun. <br />
I&#039;m not too sure if I was impressed at the time or maybe I just didn&#039;t seem to care. <br />
It does capture some of the over the top action I&#039;m used to seeing in the game itself.  <br />
<br />
But I felt there should of been a lot of more better ones from the game since <br />
Oh I don&#039;t know, ITS FREAKING BAYONETTA!! <br />
A Dominatrix with many abilities, many transformations, Weapons, Incredible finishers<br />
even more so than Dante from devil may cry himself and of course <br />
she has some great Ass-ets. ; ) <br />
<br />
Sound - 6 <br />
To be fair the anime is Based off the 2009 game along with a few soundtracks <br />
from the game, Not all mind you though. <br />
Its missing better soundtracks from the game indeed<br />
and to be honest its still really not my cup of tea anyways. <br />
I&#039;m not saying the soundtracks are bad. <br />
I just felt maybe the sound effects could of sounded better and possibly they could of used more of the video game&#039;s better soundtracks in the fight scenes. It would bring some good vibes from the game to inject it into this movie to give it more of them Bayonet Feels OOH YEEAHH..<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall - 6<br />
I didn&#039;t mind watching this movie in my spare time after all I do LOVE Bayonetta.<br />
<br />
Bayonetta Bloody Fate is Only just a decent film at best which could of been<br />
more fulfilling for fans to check out if they had done better with the material they had,<br />
I think for some depending on who you are, I honestly advise you to play the game <br />
because as I said its an Awesome game!.<br />
With this film, I feel it was trying to imitate those very elements of the game and to me it didn&#039;t really pay off that much, but then again it is quite a lot of game content to put into a normal feature length film. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, If there is something I could at least give credit for it is this.. <br />
At least it was better than that Shitty Devil may cry anime adaptation imo and that is all. <br />
<br />
for gamers into action games If you like the first bayonetta game, Also Play bayonetta 2<br />
since its even more Better if you do have an nintendo wii that is and if you do, Lucky you.

    Do you like watching things happen? Think carefully about this question. Watching anime is essentially seeing a sequence of events set to music and sound. Under this definition, there could conceivably be an anime about anything, even grass growing. The reason this hasn&#039;t happened yet is because no one would care. Sure, things are happening, but why does that matter to you? You could go outside right now and see grass grow, or you could watch something you care more about, so watching Grass-chan Adventures is understandably low on your priority list. But why is that? Why do you care about some things more than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142501">
        others, even though both things are equally happening? The answer is emotional investment.<br />
<br />
Bayonetta has a lot of things happening at any given time. Guns get shot, monsters get killed, poses get posed, one-liners get tossed around, there&#039;s never a moment when things aren&#039;t happening. But much like our kawaii Grass-chan, you&#039;re never given a reason to care. Why is Bayonetta killing angels? Why are angels killing everyone? Why are some people ghosts sometimes? Why is God evil? What was with that car? Why did Jeanne shoot all those people on that train, and why was Bayonetta there? Where was she going? Where was she ever going? Why did anything happen at all? For an hour and thirty minutes, things are happening, but these questions are never answered. The bad guy is trying to revive the biggest bad guy for... some reason? Is it God? Shouldn&#039;t people be stoked to hear that God is coming to Earth? You&#039;re never told what the stakes are, so you never care why Bayonetta&#039;s fighting. You never see her struggle, so you have no reason to care when she succeeds. You never see her in any danger of losing, so seeing her win becomes meaningless. It just turns into a sequence of events. Bayonetta beats this bad guy, so now she&#039;s going to fight this other bad guy, and she&#039;s going to win but we&#039;re not quite there yet. There&#039;s nothing to think about, no surprises, no doubt, no reason to keep watching these things happening. It&#039;s just grass growing.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t played the game that Bayonetta is based on, so I don&#039;t know how this adaption compares to the original. But I know immediately where all the emotional investment went. When you play a game, you supply the emotion. Just making progress gives you a reason to care, since you&#039;ve now invested your time towards beating the game. You learn the price of failure if you die, which adds excitement to the fights as you try to avoid that same failure. You learn the capabilities of your character, what she can and can&#039;t do, and you add your own skill in order to overcome the obstacles presented to you. Just playing the game is enough to make you care. The story and cutscenes are nice rewards for your progress, but the goal is progress itself. This is why a straight adaption just doesn&#039;t work. There&#039;s no inherent difficulty in watching anime (except for downloading codecs and stuff, but you get the point). Once you start watching, you won&#039;t fail and have to start over if you don&#039;t beat the boss. Your skill has no bearing on whether or not the protagonist succeeds. You have no control over how or why things happen, so you need another reason to invest your time. You can&#039;t help the main character fight, but you can still care if they win or lose if you&#039;re given a good enough reason. Bayonetta just doesn&#039;t give you a reason. <br />
<br />
Bayonetta isn&#039;t ALL bad. Norio Goddamn Wakamoto voices one of the leads, which makes absolutely any show better (see Wizard Barristers for an example). The art is good, if you&#039;ve ever seen a Madhouse production it looks exactly like that style. Bayonetta has some killer tits. Beyond that, it&#039;s hard to think of any other positive points.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Grass-chan Adventures? Maybe, if it ever comes out. You&#039;d probably feel the same way watching Bayonetta. Should you watch Bayonetta? Not really. The only thing this movie really has going for it is the action, which is just bland and predictable. The story is a jumbled mess, the characters are boring, and the things that happen just aren&#039;t interesting. Your time would be better spent watching something else.

    Okay, my 1st time writting a review in this page, and ill start with a simplistic comment: Bayonetta fans, dont overhype yourselves in expectations, the trailers are better than 90% of the movie.<br />
 I&#039;ll be concise. It&#039;s a watchable movie, in no way absolutely awful, but it is definetely nothing special.<br />
The story is what you already know from the games, but its development is somewhat convulted and rushed as you might expect from a game that has some actual plot adapted into a movie. The scrips are bland, Bayonetta is Bayonetta, and the rest of the chars are just &quot;there&quot; 90% of the time, theres

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133403">
        nothing noteworthy about them. Terrible villain and development for the villain.<br />
The art ranged from orgasmic, to above average but sometimes it dropped to pretty bad, I have no idea why some frames where so neglected by the artists, but overall the art is pretty good. The sound effects are decent but the music imho, is horrible. They seemed to try and make a game soundtrack instead of a movie soundtrack, and it wasnt pulled off adequately.<br />
You&#039;ll somewhat enjoy the movie as a Bayonetta fan, but likely feel very dissapointed in some other regards, if you like the character or wanna kill time and are interested then watch the movie, all youll be seeing the movie for is Bayonetta.

    After just finishing playing the game Bayonetta, I was surprised and overjoyed to hear there was a movie out; and considering how much I adored playing the game, I just had to see the movie.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the movie fell a little flat. Compared to the game, a lot of things were cut out, and it only really focused on the major plot points. I suppose it is rather hard to fit a 10+ hour video game into a 1 and a half hour movie, but still.<br />
<br />
I did enjoy the soundtrack though, and the animation; I especially enjoyed the extra scene in the hotel that didn&#039;t appear

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167237">
        in the game at all. But other than that, the movie chopped and changes a lot of the scenes, making it almost a completely different setting from the game.<br />
<br />
But; at the end of the day, I honestly enjoyed the movie despite these flaws, and  because it was Bayonetta after all.

    &quot;WARNING: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BOTH BAYONETTA 1 &amp; 2! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Video games movies are a hard bunch. How do you take a video game and translate it into live action? Will you take the risk of having a gigantic budget to achieve this goal by not only trying to make the movie look like the game but staying true to it&#039;s source or will you just half-ass the entire game by turning the movie that based of that certain property into a bunch of nothing? These are the questions that always linger to gamers and audiences whenever studios, either

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178781">
        from Hollywood or international countries, decides on making movies based on games. The problem? They have no idea how to translate something that was great in a game into a film and even those who admit that it is a common problem to movie based games, they still f*ck it up when making a movie that tries too hard on being like the game. While they are several movies like Wreck-It Ralph! Prince of Persia and DOA: Dead or Alive (yes, that film based on a fighting game filled with bouncing boob physics) proving that games can be translated well into film, the majority like DOOM, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, Postal, Far Cry, House of the Dead, Bloodrayne and all those unnecessary Resident Evil movies gives the genre an awful reputation. However, when you make an animated adaptation based off a game, it could get mixed results but work a lot better than live-action. Again, that&#039;s because animation is full of possibilities for any kind of project that can be limitless if you execute it correctly and this is something that almost works for animated movies based on video games like Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie or Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike, which allows filmmaker and animators to make a unique adaptation while still staying true to the spirit of the games that were based off.<br />
<br />
This is where Bayonetta: Bloody Fate comes in and to find out whenever this film lives up to the spirit of the games or not.<br />
<br />
For those who had never heard of Bayonetta or watched the TV spots for it&#039;s Wii U sequel Bayonetta 2 while still not having a clue on who she is, let me tell you the backstory. Bayonetta is a third-person hack and slash action game that was published by SEGA for the PS3 &amp; XBOX 360 while being developed by Platinum Games (originally known as Clover Studios before CAPCOM shut down the studio due to Okami&#039;s poor sales for the PS2 and the studio was founded by Hideki Kamiya, Keiji Inafune and Atsushi Inaba) and the game acts as a spiritual successor to Devil May Cry since Hideki Kamiya not only directed Bayonetta but also he was responsible for Devil May Cry. It follows the story of Bayonetta, a sexy, seductive and charming witch who fights angels while trying to discover her secret origin behind the downfall of the Umbran Witches and the Lumen Sages and meeting up with some friends that might know more about Bayonetta than her own self. Let me get this out of the way and say that I love Bayonetta. No, scratch that, I just ADORE Bayonetta. Not only is the game fun but it contains one of the best female characters in gaming history. She is sexualized but doesn&#039;t bother her because she enjoys being sexy and takes sh*t from no one, she has a dark but wicked personality and a good sense of humor. Plus, she can release a can a whoop-ass with her hair as a magic weapon that allows her to release demons from Inferno and use the demons against the army of angels that swarm in her path. The game is also challenging but fun to play, the combat makes Devil May Cry dropped it&#039;s jaw with it&#039;s incredibly fast paced combos, the voice acting is wonderfully solid (that Joe Pesci impression that Chick Venerra makes is spot on as Enzo), the music is bloody amazing and the story, while crazy as hell, is still a really good story filled with very interesting lore of the Umbran Witches and Lumen Sages. The game was so damn impressive that it got a sequel to the Wii U due to poor sales in the US release for Bayonetta, SEGA dropping the rights to the franchise without giving any form of support and Nintendo greatly helping funding the sequel to Platinum Games.<br />
<br />
Imagine my surprise when a Bayonetta anime film was announced back in 2013 and boy, did fans went crazy for this. Who wouldn&#039;t be hyped considering Fuminori Kizaki (the director behind AFRO SAMURAI) is helming the film while Gonzo is behind the task of bringing Bayonetta to full colored form. As for me, I wasn&#039;t hyped but I was truly excited to see Bayonetta back in a new way and in an anime no less. I sat down, watched it and after it was over... It just kinda ended. By all means, it wasn&#039;t a horrible film but the amount of potential of Bayonetta combined with animation was sorta lost in this adaptation and it marks my biggest problem with the movie but I&#039;m getting ahead of myself, let&#039;s start at the beginning shall we?<br />
<br />
The story in Bloody Fate is just like in the games but with little differences. It still centers around Bayonetta on searching for her answers of the past while dealing with other characters like Luka, a young journalist who has connections with Bayonetta due to him thinking that she killed her father when she was found at the bottom of the lake, Jeanne, an Umbran Witch that may have connections to her past and Balder, a powerful man who&#039;s conjuring up some mischievous plan to resurrect a great goddess in order to change the universe. The good thing about the story is that for those who never played Bayonetta can easily watch this film and understand the whole plot of the film without being required to play the game. That said though, the big problem is that the film&#039;s story is handled like a freaking mess with the film literally spoiling the big twists at the beginning of the damn movie. I get that fans of the game won&#039;t be bothered by this but for the common viewer that has never heard of or played Bayonetta, it is a big glaring problem when a story doesn&#039;t take it&#039;s time in developing the story and it&#039;s twists properly by instantly throwing it to our faces. For example, the scene in The Gates of Hell showed Enzo telling Bayonetta and the audiences that Balder might be up to something really bad that stupidly gives away the surprise connection between Bayonetta and Balder. Also, some of the changes in the characters are really bothering to me like again with Balder. While the other characters including Bayonetta are perfectly translated into film, the way the film handles Balder is one of the biggest screw ups in the film. To explain why I find this bothersome, I have to go into big spoiler territory into Bayonetta 1 &amp; 2 to explain why:<br />
<br />
For me, I find Balder to be an engaging sympathetic villain that may have started out as an evil bad guy in the first game but with Bayonetta 2, it reveals a lot more of Balder that we thought was impossible to execute but it did and worked. Balder is a man that not only was claimed as a great Lumen Sage among his clan but he was a man who wanted to have a family with the love of his life at her side, who&#039;s revealed to be Rosa, Bayonetta&#039;s mother and one day, they did by giving birth to a child by giving her the name Cereza, Bayonetta&#039;s original name from the first game. However, fate begins to turn ugly when the Umbran Elder, discovering the truth behind the relationship between Rosa, Balder and their child while also being furious about the truth, forbids them from having the child due to the laws of the Umbran and the Lumens that they are forbidden to express love or have any kind of relationship in order to keep the balance of the light and darkness at bay. For this, both Rosa and Balder are charged with treason and imprisoned while their child is forbidden to learn the arts of combat of the Umbran clan while being separated from her mother. Balder expressed great hatred against both the clans for destroying their connections and this triggers the events of &quot;The Witch Hunts&quot; when the spirit Loptr, who is later revealed to be a split spirit from &quot;The Eyes of the World&quot; jewels and was the split personality of Loki (good) and Balder (evil), he let Loptr possess his body and thus, the massacre of the clans began with Rosa getting killed in the process while Balder suffers as his malevolent spirit using his body destroys everything he hold dears while he does nothing but watch and grief. In the end of Bayonetta 2 where both Bayonetta and a young Balder defeat Loptr, Balder sacrifices his own body by getting the spirit of Loptr back in his body to prevent him on destroying the past yet again while apologizing to Bayonetta for not being there for her when needed and asked her to call him &quot;Daddy&quot; one last time before his pure soul becomes corrupted once more. This whole summary is why I like Balder cause he is a villain but I can understand his torment and suffering of not seeing her own daughter because that chance of happiness was taken from him and in the end, he gets the chance to fight alongside her daughter one last time before fading away with Loptr being inside his soul. This backstory could have provided so much for this more but instead, the movie decides to make him the generic &quot;the world is terrible and must be destroyed to be reborn a better place while being blinded from his own loved one&quot; stereotypical villian and did I mention that his final battle is beyond weak? He gets killed off very quickly for 3 minutes and that&#039;s it! That&#039;s the biggest waste of potential I&#039;ve seen for a villain since M.Bison from the Street Fighter The Movie.<br />
<br />
Speaking of action and animation, Bloody Fate is a mixed bag. When the animation and action gets good, it gets really good with animation being extremely fluid with tiny visual details during the flashy battles that stays true to the spirit of the game&#039;s maniacal action and the animation manages to translate the look of the game perfectly with little changes done to the character designs since director Fuminori Kizaki and character designer Ai Yokoyama are fans of the games and did an aoutstanding job at executing the feel and look of Bayonetta wonderfully. However, when the action stops and we get back to the main plot, the animation gets a huge downgrade with backgrounds, while looking very nice, barely having substance to bring the world to life. There&#039;s barely people in the whole film minus the scenes on the train, the news footage and the highway sequence but that&#039;s really about it and while the character designs look nice, the models themselves don&#039;t really seem very life-like since most of the models just stand around while objects move around the background and the CG looks very off at times cause it doesn&#039;t really go well with the hand-drawn animation during various sequences of action. Reason? It&#039;s because GONZO is infamous for having budget issues and adding CG to every show or movie they worked on and while not all of GONZO&#039;s projects are a mess (Romeo X Juliet, Gankutsuo: The Count of Monte Cristo, Welcome to the NHK and AFRO SAMURAI are my favorites work from GONZO), they tend to get screwed over their own budget constraints that results into badly unfinished animated sequences (like for example; Samurai 7, where one episode showcases creepy looking unfinished character models dancing creepily like ghosts and it looked like a nightmare). While Bayonetta: Bloody Fate looks better than GONZO&#039;S other projects and a better control over it&#039;s budget, it still contains some animation misfires that prevent this film from achieving animation perfection status. Also, the movie misses the mark on making more animated sequences with Bayonetta fighting the big 4 angels and I kid you not, there is no epic battles with Fortitudo, Temperatina, Iustitia and Sapientia but instead, reduced to pointless cameos that are never mentioned again. Really film?! You&#039;re gonna pass the chance at making unique action sequences for these 4 boss angels that provided one of the best boss battles in gaming history and only provide them cameos for Fortitudo and Temperatina?! What were they thinking!<br />
<br />
Now for the grand finale of Bloody Fate: The dub by Funimation. I&#039;m happy to report that the dub for Bloody Fate is pretty good with Funimation getting the entire cast to dub the film including Helena Taylor as Bayonetta, Grey DeLisle as Jeanne, John Kassir as Enzo, Dave Fennoy as Rodin, Yuri Lowenthal as Luka, Joy Jillian as Cereza and J. Grant Albrecth as Balder with the entire cast obviously having a blast with minor faults that goes to Joy Jillian and J. Grant Albrecth sounding very off in their roles since in the games, both of these actors gave wonderful performances that sounded distinct and unique. Also, Patrick Seitz and Dave Fennoy&#039;s perfomances as Fortitudo and Temperatina are OK but I wished they speaked in that menacing angelic language instead of hearing it in English. Also, Richard Epcar&#039;s voice narration in the beginning was pretty cool, so kudos.<br />
<br />
Overall, Bayonetta: Bloody Fate is a disappointment for fans of the game expecting a new ambitious take on the game but it is an enjoyable adaptation that manages to capture the charm and relentless action that made Bayonetta awesome to play. GONZO and Fuminori Kizaki deserves lots of credits for trying their damnest to make a solid adaption of the game and If you&#039;re a fan of the games or just curious, Bloody Fate deserves just one watch but at least it gives us a glimpse look on more possibilities for a Bayonetta anime film or series if any animation studio in Japan wants to take at another stab on this seductive witch.

    As a fan of the Bayonetta game I did not pass up the opportunity to watch this movie. Seriously, I don&#039;t think there is one person here who didn&#039;t come to watch this without having played the games first and if you are someone who has not played it you should  before even watching this.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
The story itself does not change from the game for the most part. It also retains most aspects from the original game. However, if you already played the games this is not anything new at all.  There is no presence of a new concept and most the events

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171225">
        that followed are as they are in the game. To put this game in the  hour and a half time frame they did have to rush the hell out of the story as well so be  prepared for that. Most of things you thought you were going to see aren&#039;t present in this film.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
I really enjoyed the art used in this Movie. It really represents the game well and all the characters look exactly as they did in the game and you even get to see some of the awesome weapons that were in the game like the Shuraba. I also loved the fact they didn&#039;t copy every little scene and presented somewhat of different settings while still following the story.  I really wish they included some of the other angels that did not make an appearance in this film like Golem or Grace and Glory. <br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
They pleased me very much so by not fixing what wasn&#039;t broken and that is the music and voice actors. I watched in the English dub and I gotta hand it to them for getting the same or very similar actors who played in the English version of the game.  They also brought back personal favorites of mine from the game such as Mysterious Destiny and Fly Me Too the Moon.<br />
<br />
Characters 8/10<br />
Exactly as they were in game so if you enjoyed them in game there is no doubt you&#039;ll enjoy them here. While some of the script is kind of rehashed just for the movie I still find them quite enjoyable. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Very good at retelling the story to me and they did a great job of keeping the action as presented in game. If you have played the games you should definitely watch this movie when you got the free time but just note there is nothing new the game didn&#039;t show. The movie did explain some things such as the actual correlation between Bayonetta, Cereza, and Balder if you couldn&#039;t guess just by playing the game but other than that there is nothing new. But, if you have not already played the games I high;y recommend it before watching the movie as it is a better experience and has more detailed than what this could have possibly packed in 1 and a half hours.

    This anime is amazing because it explains each element as well.<br />
<br />
In addition to having a well-made art, the sounds match each scene ...<br />
<br />
The ending was not as well-crafted as the rest, but the characters, especially the &quot;little-chan&quot;, make up the &quot;failures&quot; ...<br />
<br />
I do not think the note he received is that he deserves, because if we disregard-play, evaluate it just like anime, it actually outperforms many other ...<br />

English Dubbed<br />
<br />
Story<br />
An interesting spin on the old heaven and hell fable. All questions to get answered at some point. To avoid some confusion recall the length the main character was kept away. Just because this plays with certain religions doesn&#039;t mean one with other religion faith can&#039;t grasp it&#039;s universal message of love.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Played nicely with plot. Could be the resolution i watched but as far as finite details were concerned like amour appear during certain moments like changing appeared fuzzy.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Only issue was during the beginning. During the first battle in the church. The music used failed to play well. You could hear that it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243516">
        music but as far as telling what the lyrics or tempo was you find your self at a loss. <br />
<br />
Character<br />
Each character has their story. The stories for each one is not what it appears to be. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
A nice relaxing action piece that opens your &#039;eyes&#039; to the actual status of the world. Also, on occasion the characters have a knack act delivering some intriguing remarks or one liners.

    Well, who would have thought that the most sexiest video game character would get her very own anime OVA? Not only does it follow the story from the original game( which i haven&#039;t even played), it also has the same voice actors from the original game. The animation is also very cool! ( thanks, people who made Hellsing and that one monster school harem i forgot about (●´ω｀●) ). I suggest you look at this OVA unless you don&#039;t like bayonetta(cough cough probably because of the last smash 4 presentation cough cough) or don&#039;t like 2sexy4me content. I enjoy this movie overall but it probably

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208050">
        will not make sense to anyone doesn&#039;t know a thing about bayonetta so i suggest you should look at its wiki first or play the first and second bayonetta.

    TL;DR <br />
Nice short watch for a cool older styled anime movie. I found this enjoyable although I haven’t played any of the games/know almost nothing about the lore. Good if you like witches and people fighting angels with hair and lots of partial (soft)nudity.<br />
<br />
STORY: 5/10<br />
I know nothing and the basic plot of this was easy enough to understand thanks to the few dialogue exposition dumps the viewer gets. Interesting enough to keep me watching the whole thing although the ending is easy enough to guess from not far in. <br />
<br />
ART: 7/10<br />
Cool 90’s style looking animation. Was reasonably well done, only a few scene felt kind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301902">
        of dark and occasionally the heads looked really small in proportion to their bodies in wide shots, otherwise it was fine.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 5/10<br />
No reaction much for myself either way although it seemed to fit it well enough and some of the comments below where I was watching it were commenting on how several of the game remixes were used so that’s cool. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 5/10<br />
As good as you can expect for a movie where they kind of expect you to know who they are going in, with the basics explained or done so in expositions and not through character’s actions. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 8/10<br />
Although I didn’t get as much as a hard core Bayonetta fan would have I’m sure, I enjoyed this. It was a sexy witch lady with her clothes turning into hair and being partially naked while beating down hordes of freaky angels with the occasional innuendo.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 6/10<br />
Good if you like Bayonetta and want an easy way to pass the time. Or older styled anime movies. I wouldn&#039;t watch this around people who aren&#039;t sure about anime because they&#039;ll for sure be confused by the almost constant nudity lol.

    The movie reminded me of Devil May Cry but not as good.<br />
<br />
Bayonetta a nice action game and all thought the game was good the anime was just normal and dull... started out with a combat scene and went on from there some jokes here and there and so on...<br />
<br />
Bayonetta&#039;s attitude was priceless her attitude towards the enemies was fun to watch just like in game ... during the movie she tries to remember her past by battling her enemies , encountering some people that turn into her allies with twist and turns bayonetta is just a combat based anime with some minor gore elements.<br />
<br />
For those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133959">
        who played the game or not i would recommend to watch it atleast once.<br />

    Games that get movie or TV show adaptations usually are extremely bad. But I feel like this is one of the better ones. They bring back the original cast from the game (the English version anyway) and I feel like the VA in the game is amazing! I would recommend this to people who played the game. If you haven&#039;t played it you will probably have a hard time with it, because the story is one of the weaker elements to the game. Also, don&#039;t watch this with kids around unless if you are fine with violence, nudity, and some um..... Interesting dialogue. And if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419103">
        you played the game you know what&#039;s up. Also young Cereza is the most adorable thing ever!!! Ahhh!! I love her so much!! You can watch it on YouTube for free if you are interested in watching it. Because I couldn&#039;t find it anywhere else. And this may just be the version I was watching it with because it was on YouTube but the sound quality for the music and the sound effects weren&#039;t great. But overall I&#039;m glad Bayonetta got a movie. It&#039;s a great game franchise and it needs more love.
