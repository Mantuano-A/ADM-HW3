    There is a misconception that Shadows House is a slice-of-life, but that&#039;s not the case. It is a mystery through and through, with elements of horror. By combining clever visual storytelling, a mesmerizing aesthetic, a touch of philosophy, engaging characters, and on-the-nose class criticism it crafts one excellent show. <br />
<br />
Shadows House takes place in a mansion reminiscent of gothic horror meshed with steampunk aesthetics. The manor itself is a Victorian-era stone castle shrouded by fog high on a hill. Its imposing architecture with spiked fences resembles a prison. Inside, it is a dimly lit maze bearing heavy curtains, red rugs, drab wallpaper, finely ornamented rooms,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406360">
        and expensive wood furniture. Oil lamps light each room, and coal provides the heating. Soot coats the walls, but not from the fireplace—each member of the Shadow family is noble, dressed fancifully, and covered head to toe in soot. They appear like silhouette paintings of humans wearing colorful dresses and regal attire. Whenever they feel anxiety or anger, they emit soot. Once these shadow people come of age, they are granted a &quot;living doll&quot; or servant to take care of chores and represent their personality.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, an enthusiastic girl awakens for her first day as a living doll. Her room bears all the similarities to a prison cell; a bed, table, run-down walls. Her master, Kate, is a prim and proper shadow with a nearly identical silhouette to the girl, eventually named Emilico. Their dynamic has more depth than meets the eye; Kate possesses the qualities Emilico lacks, and vice-versa. Grace and nobility versus happiness and compassion. Their goal is to become as one with each other as possible in order to integrate into the noble Shadows family. Their diametrically opposed personalities cause difficulties. Through their struggle to conform with the aristocracy, the manor&#039;s oppressive class structure cracks begin to show. Surprisingly there is a considerable amount of action and thrills here. Light humor from Emilico&#039;s enthusiastic personality balances the otherwise bleak tone. She brings enjoyment to the show, and her dynamic with Kate leads to breakthroughs in both characters. <br />
<br />
There are five main pairings in the cast; Kate and Emilico are the primary perspectives. The dynamic between master and servant is different for each duo; parasitic, symbiotic, ambivalent, codependent, and more. All of them are compelling characters in different ways—by the end, I was emotionally attached to all of them. Their master vs. living doll relationship showcased the facets of identity a person needs to live a fulfilling life. There are life or death stakes for both the masters and servants that test their relationships. Is there one answer to the right way of forming a companionship? No, however, we see each variety portrayed; there are benefits and shortcomings to all of them. The living dolls respect the Shadow Masters almost to the point of worshipping them. In many ways, it not-so-subtly critiques modern class structures within a capitalist society. They confront how working-class people will praise the upper class, even though those people gained their power through exploiting their workers. Without the dolls&#039; unpaid labor, the affluent society would not function. <br />
<br />
The Shadows House is ruled by an oppressive class structure; the lords on the third floor, the new Shadow masters on the first floor. Beneath the tiles they walk on are the Living Dolls—levels of the mansion representing social status. Rising in the ranks to achieve success requires ambition, talent, and practice. Living dolls must forgo their personality and serve the role as their master&#039;s personality—mimicking their gestures and emotions through facial expressions. The final test, as well as a driving force of the plot, is The Debut. The pairings of young Shadow masters and dolls must prove themselves in this ominous event.<br />
<br />
The horror of Shadows House comes from watching the seemingly pleasant living dolls treated like objects, despite looking and acting like humans. Emilico is told she is a living doll, despite looking and acting like a human. She even looks for joints to oil when she feels exhausted. It can instill fear in a brightly lit room with upbeat background music. Living dolls sleep in coffin-like beds, have no connection to the outside world, no means of escape, and know nothing except to be servants. They endure abuse, work without pay, and are practically prisoners, yet they have been conditioned to believe it is normal. Success is caused by natural talent and effort in this world, and failure is not an option. <br />
<br />
There are characters with disabilities, and the systems of the Shadows House leave them behind. It&#039;d be fair to say this reflects real-world issues. The ways living dolls get mistreated during the show asks thought-provoking philosophical questions. What makes a person? Is it how much they look like a human? Or does it depend on how others treat you? What determines status? Is it your appearance, your wealth, the things you own, or your property? These questions develop with time. The main thematic throughline connecting them is identity. <br />
<br />
Both the manor, and the anime, function by its people not asking questions, but watching it only makes you ask more. Over time, we are given the puzzle pieces to put together the answers ourselves. Answers aren&#039;t given to us. It is up to us to solve the mysteries. Each twist, reveal, and clue recontextualizes prior scenes, adding heaps upon heaps of rewatch value. These reveals are entirely reliant on showing rather than telling; the manor itself gives us clues. If we&#039;re shown an object, a sign, a character, who is not immediately relevant, it will surely return later. Like all great mysteries, Shadows House is masterful at foreshadowing and reincorporation. It follows Chekhov&#039;s gun rule: If you place a gun on the stage, it must eventually be shot. Much like the gun, the direction only brings our attention to details relevant to the story. Even though this adaptation departs in many ways from the manga, it ties the narrative together with connecting plot threads.<br />
<br />
Due to the incomplete manga, this adaptation is only a portion of the whole story. For that reason, not every setup gets paid off by the end. The final three episodes are primarily anime original content, which deserves criticism. These episodes are fine, but a noticeable decline in writing quality compared to the first ten. There are plot contrivances, helpful coincidences, and convoluted motives. Overall the solid ending softened these disappointing episodes. Regardless if Shadows House receives a sequel, it succeeded in convincing me to read the manga. Although Shadows House diverges from the source material, it stands on its own merits as a great anime.

    Although I&#039;m not the type of person that is into writing reviews for anime, I decided to write one for Shadow&#039;s House since I was really looking forward to watch this show. I&#039;m glad that the first episode didn&#039;t fail to amaze me and made me crave for more. However, I can already tell that this anime will become underrated, so if you are into supernatural seinen anime you should give it a try.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
Shadows House does sound like a first class horror anime. The story<br />
of Shadow&#039;s House doesn&#039;t miss to captivate its audience within the first minutes of the anime adaption. It has many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395606">
        supernatural elements like the living dolls, that are servants and the faces of a member of the aristocratic Shadow Family, and the Shadows of the show.<br />
The house of the Shadow family is a big mystery from the start.<br />
What are Shadows? What is a living doll? Why do they need the living dolls as their &quot;faces&quot;? I&#039;m looking forward to solve the mysteries of the Shadow mansion. You can already tell that things will get interesting pretty soon.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I can&#039;t complain about the art or the animation of Shadow&#039;s House so far. I&#039;m glad that they were able to keep the art style of the manga and didn&#039;t change it a lot. Nevertheless, if you have watched a lot of anime in your life, you will see that the art style is not very rememberable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Every single piece of music adds to the atmosphere of the anime. To be honest I cannot describe how much I love the sound of this show. The opening and the ending fit perfectly. Even though the opening doesn&#039;t have any lyrics to it the melody is absolutely amazing and brings you in the right mood for watching the show. It really gives you Victorian Era vibes.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
This show gives you your basic extroverted and introverted duo, which I personally really enjoy if they have a good dynamic. On the one hand we have the bubbly and clumsy living doll Emilico and on the other hand the calm, mysterious and intelligent shadow Lady Kate. Even though they are opposites they get along quite well. At the start of the anime they have a master servant relationship, but it seems like they could develop a deeper bond.<br />
<br />
The character design is quite interesting and unique since Emilico and Kate look the exact same, but since Kate is a shadow, her whole body including her hair is black. Also the other shadows in the show and their living dolls have the same design as Emilico and Kate.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
Shadow&#039;s House has the potential to become one of the best anime of this year&#039;s spring season. It&#039;s definitely more interesting and enjoyable than those half-baked romcoms, which are getting an anime adaption this season. It&#039;s by far my personal favorite first episode of the spring season of 2021 since it makes you question the whole mystery about the living dolls and the Shadow family.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
Usually when you are really looking forward to something, it&#039;ll most likely disappoint you. However, that&#039;s definitely not the case when it comes to Shadow&#039;s House. Like I mentioned it at the start of my review, I&#039;ve been waiting quite a while for this manga to get an anime adaptation. I was pretty scared about how Clover Works would adapt this manga, but it turned out amazing. I hope that they can keep up the good work in the next episodes.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for taking your time to read my review.

    This anime is such a shame. Because if I were to rate the first 10 episodes, I&#039;d have rated it 9 or 10/10 easily. While the animation is pretty lackluster and unimaginative, it is faithful and had a nice pacing. But there&#039;s the remaining 3 episodes... how did it go from being a masterpiece to a disappointing forgettable animes season.<br />
Just what did go wrong indeed...<br />
<br />
The story is great, at least in the first 10 episodes. It is faithful (with a few changes but understandable) to the manga, and the pacing is really well. The story builds up a great mystery story with a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406404">
        interesting unanswered questions that would make anyone wanna watch just to answer those questions.<br />
It&#039;s all great stuff... until cloverworks said &quot;nah&quot;.<br />
Like I said, the last 3 episodes were a complete disaster. Completely disregarding the build up that the story created. It was rush, it was completely plot-armor dependent, and it was boring because there isn&#039;t any feeling of danger or tense in the final episode.<br />
And how it ended... Oh God. I wanna forget about it.<br />
<br />
The characters are pretty good, at least in the first 10 episodes. The remaining 3 episodes rushed out their developments and they really got ripped off by the developments they should&#039;ve gotten (basing from the manga). I don&#039;t have anything much to say.<br />
<br />
The animation, like I said, is pretty generic. It does have some good scenes here and there, but the overall direction is pretty boring for the most part. It&#039;s just a copy-paste from the manga panels.<br />
<br />
The music is good. The opening is not my cup of tea, but the ed is so banger that I have to rate it high just because of that. It&#039;s so good that I&#039;m still playing it in my playlist after a month or so of constantly playing it.<br />
<br />
Overall, just a disappointing and forgettable anime season that I won&#039;t recommend. If you really wanna watch this, I recommend watching only the first 10 episodes. Or much better, just read the manga.

    Shadows House is what you get when you mix the fun vibes of a middle grade mystery with the relevant messages of critiques on classism. It sounds like it shouldn’t work, but the unique aesthetic, engaging premise, solid writing, and good audiovisuals bring everything together to create a well-formulated anime that anyone can find enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Our story begins in a small room with a coffin-like bed. Papers of instructions and details plaster dirty walls while a small door allows access to a chunk of stale bread placed upon the dusty wooden floor. Cramped, ill-fed, and forced to work. These are the harsh living conditions of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406356">
        Living Doll—the living conditions of our main character Emilico.<br />
<br />
From the start, Emilico’s personality shines through the screen. She is a bright and cheerful young girl trying to do her best, and everyone around her is affected by her kind nature. Though one may argue that Emilico’s personality consists of traits increasingly common in a typical anime protagonist, Shadows House’s depiction of Emilico as a character is far from generic. As subject to uncomfortable living conditions, there are many times when Emilico’s identity is tested. She is looked down upon by others and is reprimanded for being herself. And when Emilico is forced to obey the rules or when she is under the control of the shadows, her bright personality is sometimes compromised. It is through this narrative that Emilico’s character isn’t simply a compilation of happy generic protagonist traits but rather an expression of the anime’s theme of power and autonomy amidst oppression.<br />
<br />
Living among the Dolls in the Shadows House are mysterious beings referred to as Shadows. Shadows are face-less figures that the living dolls attend to. They live much more luxuriously than the living dolls and have bodies made entirely of soot. Depending on a Shadow’s mood, Shadows sometimes emit their soot from the top of their heads. This means that as the shadows go about their classy lifestyles, they tend to leave a lot of mess behind which may accumulate in the rooms they occupy, spread all throughout the house, and dust the objects around them. As expected, cleaning this mess is a part of the job of the exploited Living Dolls.<br />
<br />
Though the Shadows are a clear representation of an abusive upper class, this anime doesn’t villainize Shadows as a whole. It doesn’t just say that the shadows are bad or that the masters of the living dolls are bad people who abuse the dolls without reason. This anime is much more complex than that and takes us through the nuances of the overall situation by making the Shadows House a microcosm of real society. The house contains various floors, and each shadow strives to attain higher power by climbing up the ranks which are representative of the floor on which they reside. It is a beautifully plotted setting that is easy to understand and that showcases how power and class work. By having a well-written structure that serves as the foundation for the narrative and involves each of the characters, Shadows House avoids shallow messaging like ‘shadows are bad’ and ‘living dolls are good’ and instead focuses on the bigger picture, portraying each character as a victim of the poor system.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, all of the characters act in their own ways and aren’t just labelled as “friend” or “enemy.” These characters have genuine interactions as they try to navigate through the roles they are placed in. Shadows House truly makes the audience feel like every person introduced serves a purpose in the story and makes sure that each of them has their own likable traits that’ll leave you wishing they had more screen time. Even the face-less Shadows were far from lifeless or expressionless.<br />
<br />
Most notable of the cast asides from our main character is the Shadow Kate whom Emilico is assigned to. Kate is calm and collected and finds Emilico’s cheerful behavior to be endearing. Over the course of the series, Kate and Emilico grow to be close friends that constantly encourage one another and help each other through the challenges they face. Their friendship is fun to watch, and the events they undergo lead them to develop and influence each other in interesting ways.<br />
<br />
Presentation-wise, Shadows House doesn’t let the viewers down either. The premise, proper setting, and well-written characters are all brought together by a unique gothic aesthetic that’s embedded into every aspect of the anime. In the art, we can see it in the lacy outfits and intricate backgrounds. The Shadows House itself is a a large manor with secret doors and pillars that perfectly work with the vibe that the anime gives off. The music matches the gothic aesthetic too. The opening song is a particularly fitting instrumental. And while the ending theme is more modern, it contains choral samples that exude a mysterious, almost haunting feel. There isn’t a single aspect of the show or single frame in the series that doesn’t fit the intended style. This is a show that knows what it wants to do and executes it.<br />
<br />
Shadows House is an anime more people should be talking about. As a show that is both fun yet thematically sound and mysterious yet socially relevant, this anime has a lot of variance in appeal. No matter what you’re looking for, Shadows House will likely have something for you to appreciate. The story which discusses power, autonomy, class, and friendship all at once, is well-built with likable characters. The expertly integrated gothic aesthetic alone sets it apart from most other anime, both in this season and in general. This is one of the most easily watchable and easily recommendable shows I have seen in a while, and I highly encourage everyone to give it a go.

    For anyone who&#039;s watched TPNL (S1 only), Shadows House is eerily similar but distinct. If I&#039;m being completely honest, this is the most underrated show this season and that&#039;s a fact.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Just like TPNL, Shadows House creates a happy, cheerful atmosphere/setting that has much darker and mysterious things brewing beneath it. I couldn&#039;t help myself and binged the manga, so all I can say is the story is everything TPNL could have been and more; it&#039;s truly a well-crafted, thorough story with no plot holes or reliance on plot armour to save the day.<br />
<br />
Ironically enough, I think a lot of people in the digital era

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395579">
        (and especially the insecure folks on platforms like MAL) could learn a lot about the shadow/doll dynamic explore in the series. Just a thought :)<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art and animation are quite nice, background scenery especially is very well done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Voice acting is very well done, especially for shadows and their distinct personalities (like Kate&#039;s seriousness). OP and ED are pretty good too.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
If I&#039;m being honest, I don&#039;t really like Emilia. Maybe that&#039;s just because her clumsiness pisses me off... but that being said, the characters in Shadows House are very well designed. The biggest point for solid character design is how you can tell shadows apart from one another and how they have distinct personalities despite being a literal shadow.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Shadows House is a good watch. You&#039;re left with lots of questions and pondering what&#039;s really going on at this eerie mansion. But just like any good series would, these plot points are carefully and properly unravelled and introduced, making for a beautifully crafted series. When all is said and done, this will have been one of my favourite series this season no doubt.

    I love this anime so much so to where I&#039;m obsessed with it. I&#039;ve been listening to the theme song and ending song on repeat non stop. The anime makes me want to read the manga so badly! (Can&#039;t wait till I start reading it)<br />
<br />
Also the music isn&#039;t the only thing thats outstanding about this anime either. All characters are lovable even the main characters, love the color scheme, and idk about anyone else but for me I can actually feel the eeriness and creepiness of the anime. <br />
<br />
For what I dislike about it... nothing, can&#039;t find a single thing that I dislike about this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397387">
        anime (yet)<br />
This anime is everything that TPN could have been and more!<br />
<br />
Highly highly recommend this anime!<br />
<br />
-ps this is my first ever review hope its ok.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
I must get this out of the way first: if you&#039;re thinking that CloverWorks shit the shat outta Shadows House just like The Promised Neverland, please don&#039;t be, because this work is heavily supervised by duo mangaka Soumatou, and merely did some changes lest a Season 2 is confirmed in the works (you can check out the Twitter replies about this change). As of this review, this is the only season that we&#039;re gonna get for Shadows House, and barring the anime-only changes which are made to only reflect the time constraints of how much the anime adaptation can squeeze out of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406352">
        the manga&#039;s material, I&#039;d say that this is already good enough. If there is a Season 2 in the works, the missing characters would be added back in to add to the already great showing of a Victorian-esque mystery, supernatural, horror show.<br />
<br />
So then, the easiest you need to know about Shadows House is that this works mostly like a buddy/pair-system in the so-called &quot;Shadows&quot; mansion (which in reality is a prison), where every child taken into the Shadows mansion attends to a Shadow Master known as a Living Doll, and the pair must work in tandem, because the Living Doll is an exact mirror to the attached Shadow Master who can emit soot. While that may be so for most pairings, there is one that defies all logic: the soft-spoken Shadow Master Kate and her servant, the cheerful Emilico. From the get-go, you don&#039;t really know much about the mysteries of Shadows House, it&#039;s like playing The Legend of Zelda where you&#039;re Link and you must find out the secrets of the world on your own, only except that Emilico is playing the role of the player and fumbling around with Kate, slowly opening her quiet, introverted heart to Emilico and discovering what is the Shadows House all about: what are its secrets, and with the whole other notion of other Shadow Master-Living Doll pairs, to even the higher-up Shadow Masters themselves serving under their Lord. This is more than just a typical slice-of-life anime, that&#039;s for sure.<br />
<br />
Characterization plays a huge part in Shadows House, and just within Kate and Emilico, you can get the sense that once other supporting cast of duos comes up, you can instantly see the different between these two and the rest of the master-and-servant relationship. The dynamics of the show really play to its lengths, and for that it mostly succeeded with varying levels of bonds, both good and bad. Let&#039;s take a duo that I feel is the most peculiar and interesting: Master John and servant Shaun (1 of the main supporting duos) for example. John likes to be outlandish with his principles, but Shaun chooses to be humble. Regardless, both Shadow Master and Living Doll have to work together regardless of their differences, and as eccentric as things can get, there are times when conflict arises, and they have to solve it amiably, because any sort of trouble could get your punishment harsher than what already happened. As usual, Kate and Emilico being the stand-out duo, once their acquaintance is established, they can do things that doesn&#039;t detract from who they are as individual beings, fighting for each other and learning things along the way for whatever challenges the Shadows House have in preparation for all young Shadow Masters and Living Dolls. And trust me, this is one hellish of a journey that has its fair share of twists and turns with its ever-changing plot...and Emilico, just keeps being that happy-go-lucky girl that I don&#039;t know what kind of situation would faze her speechless. She&#039;s such a glorious sunshine of a character that&#039;s as clumsy as how I adore her antics of a behaviour so cognitive and frenetic.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve really never had issues with CloverWorks when it comes to the studio&#039;s stellar production. Even with episodic director Kazuki Oohashi on his debut directorial role, you really wouldn&#039;t the notice between how amateur and professional directors do their utmost job to satisfy the fans and newcomers. Being a sister studio of A-1 Pictures, you can&#039;t really go wrong that the studio manages to ace the sense of gloominess and horror within Shadows House alone, greatly capturing the manga&#039;s dark and elusive tones, not to mention being dark that you had to up the brightness somehow. For reference, Soumatou&#039;s manga is one of the most unique I&#039;ve ever seen in a source material, and CloverWorks really did a great job hammering that look on the small screen. Two thumbs up.<br />
<br />
Even the music is somewhat unique to Shadows House. As a side note, we don&#039;t get instrumental songs quite a lot, but music composer Kenichiro Suehiro did a marvellous job on the musical side of things, as such with the instrumental OP and even Edward&#039;s theme in Episode 8. As for ReoNa, she&#039;s been a mainstay for banger songs, and the ED reflects all of that valor in a cry-for-help way of despotism. Especially with some shows subbed that come with lyrics attached, I&#039;d like you to pay attention to those because these songs hide their foreshadowing meanings and elevate the show&#039;s understanding to its senses and pulling the audience along with it. It&#039;d be best if you take a shot and read between the lines, that&#039;ll teach you how to appreciate the anime adaptation much more.<br />
<br />
Shadows House is somewhat of an oddball when it comes to adaptations, even to the hardcore manga fans who&#039;ve been waiting long enough for the source material to get an adaptation. No doubt that this show is quite the allureness that gives off a puzzling yet un-grotesque way, but it also knows how to reel the audience in for a mystery thriller that mixes so well with the slice-of-life moments, creating a balance within the two that I didn&#039;t think that would be the difference of enjoying and appreciating such a novelty of a work. Truly some great stuff here, and I would certainly like to see a Season 2 of this in the future. IT&#039;S JUST TOO GOOD to let go and honestly hard to put this down.<br />
<br />
So now I plead: CloverWorks, please make a Season 2 of this, keep the mysteries coming!

    Have you ever been wrong about a show before? Have you ever saw a show at first glance, and think that is gonna turn into that genre? Or as if it&#039;ll be something else, but could turn into something else, as if it laid a trap for you at first shot? Well this is what happened to me when it comes to this anime, and I honestly cannot really complain about that. Really cannot. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
Shadow&#039;s House is very mysterious and can give off the spooky vibes, but there is hardly any spooky vibes, at least until later on that is, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395578">
        for starters, it&#039;s really more of a cute show, then one that is dark in the beginning, as dolls are made from shadows, to be the shadow&#039;s servants. These servants are actually, quite cuuutee. Like seriously, a lot of these servants are just a pleasure to be around. Like a part of me in either episode 2 or 3, fully believed we were gonna go into a song of how good cleaning is, and I wouldn&#039;t have minded at all, as quite honestly, it would&#039;ve been real cute. But they aren&#039;t just mindless servants, as they have real thoughts and feelings that might just be their own, rather than being connected to their master&#039;s personalities and that alone. They&#039;re hard working, passionate, caring, and more, as each one is different in their own right, and some can come off as even cruel. <br />
<br />
As for the masters...Not so much. Only the one connected to our MC seems like she&#039;s the only one who is actually nice thus far. I&#039;m sure we may meet more as the story progresses. But as of right now, there is only one that is doing that, so there is at least some inner conflict going on at the home itself. As the story makes you wonder what on earth Shadow house is, but what also lays within it. Keeping a good mystery about it. As we learn more about them, and more becomes unclear, as we get to know more of the inner workings of Shadow House, and how everything is, something that&#039;ll really drive a show well.<br />
<br />
Art and sound.<br />
The art gets a special mention, as they really do a fantastic job in really making everything look in the style it&#039;s presenting, as in wen it can look gritty and real dark. Like it feels like sometimes your own screen needs a good clean, but also there are times where the bright colours look real good, despite being within a more dark atmosphere, it all looks great.<br />
<br />
The sound is fit for purpose, and really adds to the show in general. Again, this is further shown during different kinds of scenes, with for more intense ones being fitting, to it&#039;s usual tone being on full display. Great stuff in both departments here. Another big big highlight is the OP and ED songs, because they&#039;re a hit far as I am concerned. <br />
<br />
Shadow&#039;s house seemed like it was going one way, but surprised us with it&#039;s cute tone, which just left it with an even more interesting curiosity about it. Give it a watch now!

    I was excited for this show. I enjoy slice-of-life a lot, I&#039;m a fan of that creepy noble house aesthetic and I love horror. I was curious to see how all of those things would be mixed. Believe me, I gave Shadow&#039;s House a lot of goodwill.<br />
<br />
But this show is pretty boring.<br />
<br />
While the creepy and mysterious setting, the muted colors and the tense opening and ending give Shadow&#039;s House twinges of tension, it hardly ever commits to suspense. The characters are always happy and smiling, always quickly and effectively deal with any problems that arise, and the music is jolly a lot of the time.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402063">
        Fine, yes? SOLs are like that, it&#039;s the genre. But see, the problem is that the character&#039;s lives are in danger frequently. This creates this weird disconnect where the show isn&#039;t laid-back enough to work as a fun little slice-of-life, but not tense enough to work as a suspense.<br />
<br />
Even when the characters are all aware something very bad might happen to them they act like they could not care less. And it&#039;s not like they&#039;re trying to be posivitive in difficult situations or whatever. No, they really don&#039;t seem to care at all. As a result, it&#039;s difficult to take the setting seriously, but this show very clearly wants you to take it seriously, because there are minutes when it jumps head first into horror. It wants the audience be scared for the characters, but how can I be scared for them if they aren&#039;t themselves scared? <br />
<br />
Shadow&#039;s House seems commited to be boring. The only thing that the plot really has going for it is its original setting, and there definitely was some creativity in use, beside some nice attention to detail. I like how the shadows speak in third person; they don&#039;t have real faces, it makes sense that they would need to frequently identify themselves. And the mystery was interesting in concept, it had me curious. But then towards the end a few things were revealed in such a bland exposition that made it hard to care. The smaller conflicts that come up aren&#039;t any better either, all so basic and predictable.<br />
<br />
The characters are fine... Usual anime business. None charismatic enough to make up for the meandering plot.<br />
<br />
Also I need to speak about the way this show uses texture. Ah, it&#039;s ugly. There are a lot washed off, cheap-looking textures that serve no purpose other than to harm my eyes. The texture of Kate&#039;s dress and the scratches that are sometimes used in place of solid shadows I find especially egregious. Why. This show wouldn&#039;t become a visual masterpiece if it just used solid color for some things though, it&#039;s pretty bland overall.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m surprised I made it so far. Guess I&#039;ll finish it since we&#039;re close to the end. Not particularly excited though. Oh, but one good thing that came from me watching this: I really like Nai Nai by ReoNa, the ending song. Even looked up on music platforms.

    After the disaster that was Yakuneba s2, Cloverworks needed a bounce back series. Many people thought that would be Shadow’s House. While it’s an improvement, it looks like Cloverworks have still not learnt their lesson, and continue to alter established stories and characters.<br />
<br />
Shadow’s House on its own merits is a solid show. It has a lot of the same mystery and intrigue that the first season of Yakuneba had. Beneath the facade of cute character designs, lies some dark secrets. However, knowing that entire arcs and characters were removed and or changed completely for this really made it difficult to enjoy the second half of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406364">
        the show. Cloverworks again went anime original and again I’m left disappointed. Now, the good thing here is that the anime oriignal content in Shadow’s House is not nearly as bad as Yakuneba season 2. This is still a decent show, and I would recommend a viewing. The issue lies in the fact that it sets up a lot of plot points and doesn’t get to realise them because of the way the story has been condensed. The anime original ending makes it hard to even make a season 2 based on the manga because of how different it is. It’s fair to say my main problem with Shadows House is its unrealised potential.<br />
<br />
I did really enjoy the dark atmosphere of the show. I think the concept of shadows, the dolls and soot were really original and interesting. I can’t say that I’ve ever really seen a story like this before. The characters are unique and grow on you over the course of the show, particularly Emilico and Kate. I just hate that the story’s pace took a turn for the worse around episode 7 or so. <br />
<br />
All the technical aspects of the show are top notch as you would expect from Cloverworks. Great character designs, solid animation, etc. The first half of the series is really well paced and does a good job of keeping you on the edge of your seat with the mystery. Second half lacks that same pacing, but still worth a watch.<br />
<br />
While I was let down by the second half of Shadows House, it’s still a pretty good show with an interesting and original concept, some cool characters and decent writing. I highly recommend checking out the manga for the full accurate story, but the anime is a nice introduction into the world for sure. <br />
 Shadows House gets 8 fairies out of 10.

    This feels like a western concept adapted by eastern animators This is good&gt;-&lt; everything with the soot, dolls, shadows, and the characters are great. I&#039;m enjoying this, except the opening I dont like it   I really hate how it ruins all the character building from the last arc. They all lose their memories, but I love how the shadows are taking charge because of it! It&#039;s great having them leading the conflict. The lore is a bit weird tho how they got random children to look exactly like their shadow. But I love Emilico and Kate&#039;s realtionship:3 especially after this

    This Review Doesn&#039;t Contain Any Spoiler!<br />
<br />
Okay, So, This Anime Is A Lot Better Than I Thought.<br />
It&#039;s Okay To Say That My Anime Taste Is Trash Or Else, But I, Personally Fell In Love With This Anime. <br />
<br />
The Story Is Slow But Progressive. It&#039;s Unique And  Gave Me Some The  Promised Neverland  Vibes. The Story  Is Getting More Interesting, And Interesting Every Episode. This Show iS Really Hooked Me Up.<br />
<br />
The Animation, And Sound Effects Are Great, There&#039;s Nothing Special About It, But I Liked It!<br />
<br />
The Music, Nothing I Can Say About The Music, It&#039;s Just Perfection, From The Opening Song To The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397024">
        Ending Song. I Really Loved Both Of Them, They&#039;re Fits With The Anime Theme Perfectly.<br />
<br />
Overall, This Anime Is A Great Anime So Far, It&#039;s Promising, And The Story Is Unique. If You Love To Watch The Promised Neverland, You May Also Gonna Like This Anime. I Feel Like There&#039;s Gonna Be A Huge Plot Twist On This Anime, But Hey. Let&#039;s Just Wait ;)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m Sorry If My English Is Confusing, Because English Is Not My First Language, And This My First Review. <br />
<br />
So, Have A Great Day, Everyone!<br />
                      <br />
Sincerely, Agesta.<br />

    Every Season there are various anime that instantly become popular, but then there are also anime like &quot;Shadow&#039;s House&quot; which are unfortunately not so popular, despite being AMAZING gems!<br />
<br />
Before starting this review, I would like to point out that my review might contain minor spoilers of the first episode of shadow&#039;s house.<br />
<br />
In my option Shadow&#039;s House is a major masterpiece, it finds the perfect balance between mystery, horror and light hearted scenes. Each scene for me was memorable, and from the start of the anime, there were always hints of a much darker plot being slowly approached with every passing episode. I am happy to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406414">
        say it did not disappoint, furthermore, with the absolutely stunning visuals, amazing animation and some of my favorite music scores this Season, there wasn&#039;t a single moment where I felt bored watching this anime, especially as the story progressed.<br />
<br />
Below I will delve into the main categories of this show, without spoiling anything major;<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 10/10:<br />
The Story revolves over a large number of unique characters, with each character having their own Shadow Master to serve, some characters are similar to the Shadows, some are quite different. I will not get into detail, but this made an absolutely amazing narrative. Furthermore, I have never ever seen an anime that is remotely similar to this anime, and as such I must praise the author of this story for coming up with something very unique and very interesting!<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 10/10:<br />
As previously mentioned, the art was absolutely outstanding! When I look at art, I mainly look into 2 categories, the Aesthetics (i.e. how the characters, and world look like.) as well as animation. And this show delivers both perfectly! All scenes are made in high detail, and every single time I would happen to pause the anime for some reason or another I couldn&#039;t help but be shocked by the pure level of background detail. Furthermore, all animations that I have noticed within the anime are all very smoothly animated, and there was never any scene that felt out of place.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10:<br />
There are a good number of really well made OSTs in the show, I have left a link to the anime&#039;s outro above, just so you can get an idea of how great the music is. (Along with the artwork.)<br />
<br />
Character 9/10:<br />
The Story took a lot of time introducing each character properly, topping this off with amazing narrative, the anime was able to change how I felt about characters (From hating to loving, and vice versa) with pure ease. Furthermore, each character feels unique and special. To a point where I genuinely have fun seeing the characters interacting with each other.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10:<br />
I overall enjoyed watching this anime, and I would gladly re-watch a second, perhaps a third time. The only thing going on through my mind after watching this, is &quot;When are we getting another season?&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10:<br />
The author of this anime&#039;s story made a magnificent job writing a completely unique, yet wonderful story. Furthermore, the Studio responsible for this masterpiece did a wonderful job visualizing the author&#039;s creation.<br />

    I maybe just a salty manga reader.<br />
<br />
 Shadows House is easily one of my most favorite series of all time. But I think it just works better as a manga than an anime. <br />
<br />
The anime at first felt extremely slow-paced but at the end they completely hastened the whole plot, revealing things that showed up much more later in the manga. During the final episodes, they also sort of killed all the nuances a certain characters and just fastened their whole development as a character.<br />
<br />
The great things about this adaption is- the animation, music and voice acting.<br />
Basically production-wise, it&#039;s great.<br />
<br />
<br />
I probably would&#039;ve rated it higher

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406394">
        if it weren&#039;t for those horrible final 3 episodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Small story short, just just read the manga if you wanna experience the full potential of this series.

    “I am a Shadow, the true se-“. Wait, this isn’t Persona? But they look exactly like each other, just like a darker reflection of themselves. How is this not Persona?!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
In the Shadows House lies many Shadow nobles, each of whom are tended by a living doll that’s made in the likeness to their Shadow master. The living doll has the responsibility of tending to their Shadow master, doing everything from cleaning the mountains of soot that piles up in their room to acting as their face for expression purposes since Shadows do not have an obvious face for those to see. It is here where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406447">
        a new, unnamed living doll (later renamed Emilico) tends to her Mistress Kate, as the two become more acquainted and gradually unearth more about the Shadows House that they live in.<br />
<br />
Credit where credit is due, I think Shadows House is a really unique story that has a lot to love because of its intrinsically unique worldbuilding and branching mystery that extends as a result of the narrative effectively blossoming out from one point. Given how the show starts in a rather cramped room where our duo of protagonists stay in, the show over time shows us more and more of both the setting and the story, increasingly revealing parts of the Shadows House at an even pace that gives the audience more of an understanding of how everything in this giant mansion house functions. Every rule, every structure, and every role in this show is solidified over time, giving a nice rigidity that feels good to follow and easy to watch. And because the show is so well-paced in this aspect, everything snugly ends up falling in place once some of the bigger reveals are shown at the end of the series due to the build-up being both earned and the mystery feeling more or less satisfying as a result of the show’s pacing.<br />
<br />
If I had any real gripes with the show’s story, it would definitely be the slower middle portion where we get the full scope of our ‘main cast’. Personally I feel like the entire ‘debut’ arc takes way too long, something that is entirely due to the pacing of the series before and after said arc where the story both introduces and talks about a lot of new information at an even pace. By comparison, the debut feels extremely sluggish because there’s hardly anything new. It’s great for character interactions and for the 5 pairs of shadow masters and dolls to get to know each other, but in terms of moving the story along, I think it does a pretty poor job at that. I’d also be remised to mention the sort of ‘grand reveal’ that happens towards the end of the season where pretty much all of the important factors of the show are explained. For stuff like this, it’s not really a steady drip feed as we’re used to, but is instead a big loredump that feels kind of out of place given the tension and pacing that was expressed prior. True, they do have to reveal stuff at some point, but it definitely feels thrown in there instead of something that’s more naturally integrated with the plot.<br />
<br />
That being said, there’s not actually that much I can complain about Shadows House’s story. The show pretty much delivers on the macabre and happy story that it sets out on the table, slowly feeding the audience bits of this story in a well-paced mystery/thriller that both has moments of tight tension and relaxed brevity, providing a married mix of quality storytelling in between meaningful character interactions between its cast. If anything, I hope that this show gets a season 2, because it bloody deserves it given how unique and genuinely interesting the story seems continuing from this point onwards due to how many more secrets there are remaining in the enigmatic Shadows House. That and like they definitely set some stuff up for intrigue, and I’m greedy for more of a good thing.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Due to the unique nature of Shadows House, it’s kind of hard to talk about any individual character due to the dual nature of the Living Doll and the Shadow Master. Emilico and Kate serve as a grand antithesis to a majority of other similar pairs on account of their individuality from each other (right down to the fact that the two of them have different voice actors compared to the other pairs being voiced by the same person). While Kate is more reserved and soft-spoken, Emilico is a dumb child who acts innocently to the things around her. The two act as stark contrasts to each other, and create an interesting dynamic because they’re such an awkward pair. The differences are why these characters work so well in the story since they shine in an environment and thematic where master and servant are concrete statuses where one quite literally follows in the footsteps of the other. And their relationship serves as a wonderful focal point in the series which echoes beyond that of their own little group of friends.<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, the other child pairs: Ricky and Patrick, Rum and Shirley, Shaun and John, and Lou and Louise act as examples in the story that show off the various relationships and personalities that exist within the Shadows House. It’s interesting given how these are effectively 8 separate characters, but mostly function as only 4 given how each pair is a single unit that provides a combined perspective to add to the story. Which the story I think uses to its fullest extent, both by letting the masters and dolls stay together to act out the personality combination they have, as well as separating the pairs so we get a perspective of what the characters are like by themselves without the other one around. It’s honestly a great way to get character moments in a show that’s mostly story-based, and I’m really happy the show took the leap to do what it delivered.<br />
<br />
Side characters are also an interesting bunch from a worldbuilding perspective. The rest of the cast are pretty much just establishing points to set the stage for the world, including but not limited to Barbie the Star Bearer, Edward, and the higher shadows in the 3rd floor governed over by the prestigious ‘Lord Grandfather’ who seems to be the one calling the shots over everything that occurs in the Shadows House. True many characters don’t really get their time in the spotlight, but they’re all great in their own right due to what they provide for the story compared to who they are individually.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />

I think Cloverworks did a really good job with Shadows House, though it certainly does deviate from the manga’s original storybook style. Sure there’s a loss there, but I think the details of the corridors to the design of the frilly dresses and color-schemed shadows and dolls more than make up for a bit of stylistic loss. The shadows in particular I think are a great point of interest to point to because of their entire silhouette being that of a completely black figure with no discernable shading or highlights to speak of. That and the smoky soot effects that they constantly emit look good with everything that’s going on, thus adding more to the overall look of the show with all of these additional (and sometimes excessive) particle effects that go practically everywhere and are used everywhere in the show.<br />
<br />
As for the OST, honestly, it has no right to be as good as it is. ‘a hollow shadow’ by Suehiro Kenichiro, the music producer for the show, is a completely instrumental track that helps set the viscerally uncomfortable tone that the Shadows House creates. A place of somber peace, yet something is…not quite right with how everything is. The op really sells this imagery and I really love the aesthetic choice of a purely instrumental piece as it stands out among a sea of J-pop songs and really makes Shadows House seem like its own.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the flipside, ReoNa’s “NaiNai” is a dynamic, shifting song that, much like the show, gradually grows in tension the longer the song plays for. It does a lot of heavy lifting, especially since its sister is just a purely instrumental piece. Because of this, NaiNai stands out a lot, alternating a lot between her usual style of song in between these sound bites and other softer moments that help sell the dramatic nature of the living dolls and Shadows that feel unsettled by everything here in the Shadows House. It’s a memorable song, especially due to how it starts and what it leads up to. That may be my partial bias towards me liking ReoNa’s work, but this song in particular really fits with Shadows House, and I really find it to be a great song that’s memorable to boot.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Compared to some other things that I’ve talked about this season, this show definitely got a little bit more clout than others, but not by much I think in the public eye. The show is a lovely little mystery, combining both the unsettling with sometimes comfortable and cheerful moments in a setting that’s both imposing and grand in its scale. Everything settles so neatly in Shadows House that it ends up putting a lot of previous actions and/or moments into a more malicious perspective, thus giving the show an air of uncertainty even in its more cheerful moments. All of this rings especially true in perspective of Emilico and Kate, as Emilico especially I find to be a special kind of ‘stupid cute’ where she’s airheaded about basically everything but manages to work her duties in spite of that. Something that I never really would’ve expected from this show because typically dumb anime girls in particularly are like that for the moe factor. Which sure, you can argue that, but I think it serves more of a purpose this time around due to her unique position as a contrast to the world around her, so I’m more than willing to give it a pass on that front.<br />
<br />
While I have my qualms about the debut arc and its fucking maze overstaying its welcome, everything else in the show makes Shadows House a unique piece of fiction that fulfills its own little niche within stories that feature doppelgangers of some kind. There really isn’t anything else to say about it because the show works through all of its story beats in a competent manner, and I honestly just want more. There’s so much about this story that hasn’t been talked about or shown, and I really want to see more of this setting and what other twisted and macabre shit goes on in this Shadow filled house.<br />
<br />
Which means…go watch it. Seriously, gold star recommendation. Shadows House is a very unique show; practically nothing like it exists in the realm of anime. Truthfully I can’t think of anything that serves as its equal, and I’m really happy that this little gem showed up to showcase a level of creativity that sometimes anime just doesn’t take the dive to get into. I only wish there was more of it because there really is more to this story than what we’ve seen already, and I could definitely use more sequel seasons of shows that have interesting storylines instead of more isekai or ones that’re underserving of the sequel treatment.<br />
<br />
Now, one last time, are we SURE this show still just isn’t Persona? (For legal reasons, this is a joke.)

    This is such a underrated show this season ! This is the first review im ever writing and i only watching this because cloverworks made it and their recent shows were all really good. This is one of my top favourite shows now, since the first episodes it has caught my eye and after watching episode 10 i am also going to read the manga. <br />
The opening song, ending song , sound track , animation style , everything about this show is so perfect. Even after the episode is over it leave you with some kind of mystery and a whyyyy or whaaat ? You

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402178">
        should totally try giving atleast the first episode a shot if you somehow come across it !

    Shadows House is a wonderful little slice of life mystery show with a rather unique sinister undertone, and something of a redemption arc for Clover after Promised Neverlands absolute car crash of a second season.<br />
<br />
The story hits all the right beats, with each episode being an interesting peek into the every day lives of characters in its bizarre world whilst also slowly drip feeding information as you, the audience, gradually figure out how its world works alongside the main character Emilico.<br />
<br />
Emilico really is the standout character here, as she&#039;s the rare &quot;energetic, cheerful and near infallible moral paragon&quot; archetypal shounen-y protagonist that manages to sidestep

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400729">
        being annoying entirely. She&#039;s just fun to watch and exudes kindness in the same way that Mob does in Mob Psycho 100 for instance (although her mannerisms are wildly different of course). Beyond that, the show&#039;s entire ensemble has been deftly handled so far, with each character getting their fair share of screen time and development, and each member of the main cast is well written and likable in their own way, while the antagonists are suitably fascinating and mysterious.<br />
<br />
The art exudes charm as well, the stunning aristocratic victorian environments contrasting against the ever encroaching soot and the creeping shadows and darkness really sell the shows atmosphere perfectly.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is solid too, the characters voices fit well with their characters. Not much to say here other than they do a good job.<br />
<br />
Overall, I highly recommend this show, it&#039;s a real hidden gem this season.<br />
<br />

    This review is coming from someone who hasn&#039;t read the manga and watched the anime with completely no expectations, only going in out of curiosity. Let me start off by saying that this show started airing at the worse possible time as Spring 2021 was one of the most stacked seasons in anime on the same level of that of the previous Winter season. Because of this, Shadow&#039;s House ended up being one of the most underrated anime of the season with it getting not enough attention that it honestly really deserves. <br />
<br />
The story takes a fairly slow start and really takes it time to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406721">
        immerse you into the world. It may seem really boring at first but eventually it will start making sense that this show is a bit more unsettling and overall mysteriousness the more you watch, keeping your interest with lots of questions and answers throughout. This show is often compared to The Promised Neverland in this aspect though with the execution of both of these being a bit more different. By the end it leaves you with a satisfying ending leaving room for a possibility of a 2nd season. A common thing talked about it&#039;s ending is that the show actually takes an anime original route in the possibility of a 2nd season never arriving. Anyone familiar with CloverWorks&#039; attempts with anime original endings knows that they seriously do not a good job at it, though in this case I actually give it a bit of pass. If you&#039;re an anime only watcher like me, the anime original route will almost be not noticeable unless you actually know when it begins. And even with the knowledge of knowing it&#039;s anime original, nothing feels super forced or rushed, maybe it does to manga readers but as an anime only you really don&#039;t need to worry about it. Especially since it&#039;s confirmed that the ending actually had very few manga spoilers, so if you do decide to read the manga after your experience isn&#039;t spoiled. <br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t anything to special but that doesn&#039;t remove from the fact that it&#039;s really good. There weren&#039;t probably a single time where I thought the art was off in anyway and it for sure went well with the overall story. What definitely takes the cake was the music and overall sound. The OP was very unique with it&#039;s lack of vocals and only consisting the classical instrumental, with the ED probably being the best this Spring 2021 season as a whole. The background music throughout the show were also really fitting and went well with it&#039;s moods. The characters aren&#039;t anything too crazy, or any that sticks out expect for maybe Emilico and Kate, but they all are very fun and great characters and add a lot to the show in the form of great moments and overall company.<br />
<br />
This show was without a doubt one of my favorite series with my enjoyment throughout being really high. Went in with no knowledge or expectations and went out feeling with excitement and even ready to start reading the manga, though I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m going drink my normal tea while reading.

    Shadows House is probably the most interesting and intriguing Anime from the Spring Season. I mean, even the cover image is enough already to get your attention. And you should definitely give it a try and watch it! <br />
<br />
<br />
- Story - <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not comparing but the premise of the show is a mix of The Promised Neverland and cute SoL moments in between. We still don&#039;t know very much about the whole story but what we got so far is really dark, creepy but also kinda sweet and lighthearted. The balance of those two things is actually so well made because when you see the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395610">
        interactions between Kate and Emilico, you think to yourself: “This is so cute and wholesome!” but at the same time you know, there&#039;s something scary going on in the shadows. The pacing is slow but not even boring in a slightest, it fits perfectly. I&#039;d rather get information bit by bit than getting it thrown straight in the face so I really enjoy that aspect. The slow setup with little hints about the background is greatly executed. It makes you wonder, what is going to happen next and keeps you excited. What I need to address too is that the worldbuilding is masterly done so far. There&#039;s so much detail to the environment, the rules and generally the surroundings. Yes, there are still many questions but seeing how the world in the mansion is organized is mindblowing. The atmosphere is also very eerie and just gives off such mysterious presence that makes your skin crawl. I love the subtle way of showing us the creepy side of the Anime and the story itself is unique and promising. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Art and Animation - <br />
<br />
I love the use of colors in the Anime. They aren&#039;t bright and vivid but have a more grayish tone in them. It&#039;s perfect for the setting. The animation is fluid and excellent, there&#039;s really not a single bad thing about it. CloverWorks as it&#039;s finest again! They did a really good job with the shadows and designs, too. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Characters - <br />
<br />
We still have a long way to go with the characters in terms of introduction because the cast is really huge but we only saw just a handful so far. I can&#039;t really say anything big about them but I&#039;ll try. Emilico is the living doll of Kate. She&#039;s lively, clumsy and enthusiastic. We all know, there&#039;s more to her position in the Anime but I like how she gives us this tiny feeling of joy in all the darkness of the show. Her interactions with Kate are pure and innocent and I really like the little adorable moments between them. They also fight, make up and talk about their feelings and it shows that the relationship is growing and actually progressing which I really enjoy. Kate on the other hand is more soft-spoken and reserved so simply having a bit of both is really great. The Supporting Characters are also interesting in their own way and Shadows House really takes their time to fully introduce them like they did with Mia and Sara. Every doll has their own motivation and why they serve their masters. Also the different relationships between the dolls and the shadows can be very complex, showing us every type of relationship. It can be abusive, friendly, distant, awkward and I really love that. Just seeing how they interact is amazing. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Sound - <br />
<br />
I&#039;m really blown away by the OST. It stands out so much and every single piece they took for the different scenes simply fit perfectly. The OP/ED themes are also heavenly. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment and Overall- <br />
<br />
Yes, I do enjoy Shadows House. I&#039;m really weak for dark and creepy shows with a hint of spookiness in them because we get to see so little of them. It also gives me some Shiki vibes and honestly, that Anime was terrifying. I expect a even stronger story to come and I&#039;m also excited for the other characters that are going to make their debut. If you want something different from all the other ongoing Anime right now then Shadows House should be your first pick. It&#039;s certainly something else.

    Probably my favorite anime of the spring 2021 season. Very original in my opinion. I can&#039;t really say there is a lot of other anime or shows that I feel are similar to this. I think there are a lot of mysterious and interesting aspects of the story that can be looked at deeply (like the relationships between the dolls and shadows between one another or how the hierarchy of the house works). <br />
<br />
There are a lot of different personalities between everyone and fun to watch how they work off each other. The atmosphere of the show is amazing and I love how well they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410108">
        work the bright and cute moments in with the mysterious and darker aspects of the story. <br />
<br />
I do admit it was a little slow at the start, but once you get through that, I think this is a really fun and interesting anime to watch. Not a complete story at the end of the season but either way, one of the best and more memorable anime of the season. Definitely worth a watch.
