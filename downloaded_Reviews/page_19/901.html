    Gundam SEED started off as just another Gundam series for me. I watched it because it was airing and convenient... I didn&#039;t expect it to become my favorite Gundam series of all time.<br />
<br />
STORY - At this point, you&#039;d have to stretch pretty far to find a Gundam series with a mindblowingly different premise, so there&#039;s no point in really focusing on the fact that yes, this is another series about teenagers in giant robots fighting a war that&#039;s pretty pointless. There is nothing new about Gundam SEED, but then, it deserves points for being able to stand out despite that very fact. For me, one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5286">
        of the most appealing things about SEED was its very easy-to-understand plotline. The root of the war, while decidedly trivial to some extent, is simple. I&#039;m sure more than a few people were confused, and subsequently put off, by the political madness that ravaged the plots of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, as well as newer classics like Gundam Wing, so it was nice to see something so simple come along.<br />
<br />
In addition to the war, one of the strongest story points for me was the conflict between Athrun and Kira. The cruelty and tragicness of pitting friend against friend works very well here, and I know I&#039;ve said before that I&#039;m just a sucker for this kind of stuff. For SEED, this conflict was well done, progressed smoothly, and resolved rather satisfactory. It was pretty neat to see the same conflict mirrored later with Dearka and Yzak too. Also, this series was one of the first in a long time to surprise me so much with things happening in the story. People died. People you really didn&#039;t expect to die died. So many people die that at some point, you kind of started wondering if anyone was actually going to live! But despite the number of deaths, you never got the feeling that it was overdone, or that any of the characters&#039; deaths didn&#039;t have some significance or meaning, and that&#039;s definitely a feat. <br />
<br />
Those two aspects of SEED made up for all the cliches that came with being a Gundam series -- white mask&#039;s ulterior motive was nothing amazing, and the ending to the war wasn&#039;t anything special either. But by the end of it all, it isn&#039;t the basics of the story that&#039;s important, it&#039;s all the progress you&#039;ve made with the characters and their own personal resolutions.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - The characters in SEED probably contributed the most to gaining my favor. All of them are exceptionally well done. Yes, even the minor characters, which is definitely a rarity in anime. All of them seem like real people; they&#039;re complex and have emotions, motives, flaws. Both of the protagonists are split between a side that has to fight and a side that hurt because of everything that&#039;s happening. After all the stoic personalities in Gundam Wing, it was incredible for me to see characters that would actually cry. On several occasions, even. In fact, for the first half of the series, it seriously surprised me just how much of a crybaby Kira was. But it worked for his character, so even though he kind of turned into a godmodding, self-righteous bastard later on, it was okay.<br />
<br />
Kira aside, for me, Athrun was the most interesting character and had the most depth. Throughout the entire series, he was in conflict. And as soon as one conflict was resolved, another would present itself. The poor guy was in constant turmoil, which was really great to see. He was easy to relate to and never grew out of reach like Kira did. Secondary characters like Cagalli and Lacus were also refreshing to see -- female characters that had strength to stand up on their own. Indeed, one might venture to say that our male protagonists depended much more on their female counterparts than the other way around, as is traditionally the case.<br />
<br />
It would be exhausting to go through the list of other characters, though many of them are also important and very relevant. Suffice to say that there are almost NO flat characters in SEED. All of them have dimension and depth and develop throughout the series. I don&#039;t really think this happens in many other anime.<br />
<br />
ARTWORK &amp;amp; ANIMATION - I rather like the art style of SEED (the same people also did Sokyuu no Fafner); it&#039;s pleasing to the eye and works well for the content of the series. The animation itself is pretty average, and I&#039;m still waiting for the day when explosions in the distance graduate from looking like Pacman, but oh well. There&#039;s nothing else really worth noting, but it certainly isn&#039;t an ugly series.<br />
<br />
MUSIC - I... adore the music for this entire series. All three instrumental soundtracks are well worth getting! The battle music is strong and epic! The introspection music is interesting and intriguing! The tragic music makes the already tragic scene ten times more touching. It&#039;s just fantastic all around. After the bigshots Yoko Kanno and Yuki Kajiura, it&#039;s Toshihiko Sahashi that makes it on my playlist the most! And the OP/ED themes are pretty much all top notch as well. I&#039;ve been a fan of T.M. Revolution for a long time, so &amp;quot;Invoke&amp;quot; was perfect for the first opening. SEED introduced the world to Nami Tamaki, and I must say I&#039;ve definitely become a fan since her debut. SEE-SAW and Mika Nakashima are always good as well, and even the lesser known artists in the lineup are pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
DUBBING &amp;amp; VOCALS - I saw the first half of this series in English but ended up seeing the second half subbed (because SEED was, for some reason, so unpopular that CN shoved it in a death slot). The dub was nothing spectacular certainly, but it was decent. None of the voices were up to par with their Japanese counterparts, but the only one that seriously annoyed me was Richard Cox, and that was mostly because the man can&#039;t seem to change his voice between characters (and thus, the character he voiced sounded like Inuyasha to me). The Japanese cast, on the other hand, is top notch. Akira Ishida as Athrun remains one of my favorite performances ever, and Souichiro Hoshi as Kira was pretty great too. And of course, you can&#039;t forget Rie Tanaka as Lacus -- Lacus has several songs she performs within the series and Tanaka is the one singing all of them. It always pleases me when they&#039;re able to do that and helps reaffirm the fact that the Japanese seem to take their voice acting much more seriously than we do.<br />
<br />
OVERALL - I know I haven&#039;t seen all of the Gundam series out there, but of those I&#039;ve seen, this is definitely my favorite. The characters come to life and everything else falls into place behind that. A lot of people cling onto Mobile Suit Gundam as the only good one because it&#039;s the original, but though it was a good series that obviously propelled the creation of all subsequent Gundams, for this generation of anime fans, it&#039;s sorely outdated. I really feel like Gundam SEED should be the series taking its place for the post-2000 generation of fans. That statement may bode well in Japan, as this series was wildly popular, but I&#039;m disappointed to see that it failed miserably in the States. Chalk that up to other factors though, &#039;cause this series is damn good.

    I&#039;m going to be 100% brutally honest with this review, so if you don&#039;t like or want to hear my opinion, you should probably stop reading at this point.<br />
<br />
I honestly don&#039;t see what the appeal of this series is, and this is coming from a die hard Gundam fan that has seen most Gundam series that have ever been made. I was excited about this series when I first heard it would be coming out, but after only getting roughly 10 episodes into it, I was sick to my stomach and couldn&#039;t take anymore. If you like the series, good for you, I have nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6872">
        against that, it&#039;s just this series didn&#039;t even come close to living up to the previous Gundam series that came before it.<br />
<br />
Story: Ok, this was the first thing that I noticed about the series and the thing I hated the most about it: Gundam Seed&#039;s story is pretty much 90% a blatant copy of the original Mobil Suit Gundam story from 1979. If you think Seed has a good story and you&#039;ve never seen the original Gundam, I highly recommend you go watch that to see where this series got it&#039;s material and to see what a &#039;real&#039; Gundam series should be like. Yes, I only got 10 episodes into the series, but that&#039;s all I needed to completely lose faith in this series story wise, because I had already seen the same story pulled off in a much better fashion.<br />
<br />
Animation &amp;amp; Sound: This is really the only thing I can&#039;t fault the series on, in my opinion it had amazing animation and sound. Actually, this is probably the only reason I stuck with the series for so long before finally giving up on it as a massive train wreak. The animation down to the smallest detail is very well drawn and very well executed, and the sound helps to accent that. Overall, this was the only good thing about the series.<br />
<br />
Character: I won&#039;t spend much time on this, because I have pretty much the same thing to say about the characters as I had to say about the story, just a copy of the original series. Group of young kids/teenagers get caught up in a war and are made to face the opposing forces (ZAFT in this case over the original series&#039; Zeon) in which one of those kids must pilot the Gundam and fight off the standard &#039;villain in the white mask&#039; (Char in the original, I don&#039;t know or care about his name in Seed). Overall from what I got out of the episodes I saw, the characters lacked depth at all. Once again, to see this series and it&#039;s characters told in a much better way, please watch the original Gundam series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I didn&#039;t enjoy this series one bit, and it actually killed the Gundam franchise a little in my opinion that thankfully Gundam 00 restored a little in my eyes. Again, if you like this series, thats for you, but coming from someone that grew up watching all the Gundam series, I felt it was just a very bad and poorly executed attempt to re-tell the original Gundam story for a new generation, which itself really wasn&#039;t a bad idea, it was just pulled off very badly. Overall, if you want to see a Gundam series, I would recommended several of older series over Seed anyday.

    Gundam Seed was my first taste into the Gudam universe. At first I was really hesitant to start watching this series because I thought the show was for children because of the mecha. However once I started watching the series, I couldn&#039;t stop without finishing it.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
The whole series is basically about an ongoing war between the Natural human race and the genetically superior Coordinators. This may seem like a straightforward plotline, however several things push the plot so it is not as simple as it seems. Throughout the series you are left wondering which side is truly the right side to be on. Throughout

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28699">
        the series you get to see both sides of the story as much of the Natural&#039;s justifications are shown with Kira and most of Coordinator&#039;s justifications are shown with Athrun.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Because this is a very old series, the art style is very different from the art style today. It&#039;s not to say that it&#039;s bad, but it might take some getting used to for someone who has only started watching anime recently. The battle scenes have a lot of flashing lights and aren&#039;t choreographed too badly. I would say this area is the weakest point of the whole series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
I thought that all of the opening and ending songs really fit the series as a whole. The best music to me was Rie Tanaka&#039;s singing throughout the series. I was really amazed when I first heard her sing has Lacus Clyne because she sung for her own character. In my experience, many people usually get singers to sing their character roles. So I was really impressed that she sung her own song and that she was actually very good at it.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
The characters are the strongest point of this series. This series is built on the interaction between the characters. The battles and action almost seems secondary to me compared to the drama occurring between the main characters. This series has a lot of characters that pushed the plotline forward, but the main characters really shone above the others.<br />
  Kira Yamato is the main protagonist of the story. During the beginning of the series he really is a normal person with many weaknesses and faults. However as the series progresses, he grows and matures in order to face the trials given to him. I believe Kira&#039;s growth as a person is one of the things that really grabs a viewer. He grows from a weak school student to a leader that many people can count on.<br />
  Athrun Zala is another main  protagonist of the story. Athrun enters the story on the opposite side of the war as Kira. Their past history of being childhood friends becomes one of the key factors in the story as Athrun and Kira both fight on opposite sides in the war. Athrun&#039;s emotional struggle continues throughout the series as he tries to figure out what is the right thing to do.<br />
  Lacus Clyne is one the main female protagonists of the story. While originally appearing as Athrun&#039;s finance, she later becomes Kira&#039;s love interest. Lacus&#039;s first appearance in the series is as a normal girl who doesn&#039;t hold any importance in the war aside from the fact that her father is the High Supreme Councilor of the Coordinators. However as the story progresses, Lacus quickly shows her strength as she rallies up support against the war in face of great opposition.<br />
  Cagalli Yula Athha is the other female protagonist. Although very close with Kira in the beginning of the series, she later becomes Athrun&#039;s love interest. She appears in the beginning of the series as a strong woman who is capable of fighting for what she believes in. Later on in the series her heritage of being the daughter of Orb&#039;s leader is revealed. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
Gundam Seed is one of my most favorite series of all time. I would say that this is a must see series for all new, incoming anime fans.

    I&amp;rsquo;m not really into mecha anime, so when I decided to watch Gundam SEED (GS) I was a bit reluctant.  I was primarily expecting lots of action and very little on story and characters.  However, considering the positive reviews I decided to give it a chance.    Anyway, before I start I would like to say that I watched several universal century Gundams (0079, Zeta, and Char&amp;rsquo;s Counterattack) and even did reviews for them.  So I may make several references and comparisons.    <br />
<br />
GS was considered to be an updated version of the original Mobile Suit Gundam (MSG)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5596">
        for the 21st century, as it deals with more contemporary issues (ie cloning, genetic modification, etc).  So it should be no surprise that GS starts out in a very similar vein to MSG.  However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that GS copied MSG, instead GS took the best parts of MSG and improved it.  Well at least for the first half of the series.  The pacing was a definite improvement as it was nearly flawless, I can&amp;rsquo;t really separate the episodes easily as they blended so well together which makes GS ideal for marathoning.  The story is also very similar, 2 warring factions, political intrigue, and the viewpoint of both sides, typical Gundam.  I don&amp;rsquo;t need to get in to specifics, in general the crew of the &amp;lt;new advanced ship&amp;gt; attempts to escape/fight off another ship and its crew.  This is while trying to get to a specific destination and completing various checkpoints.  Sure it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most original of stories but paired with its fast pace and execution it was damn entertaining in its own right.  However, in the case of GS the characters take a much bigger role.  While the 1st half was good and entertaining it doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare to its 2nd half.<br />
<br />
The 2nd half was where GS breaks free from its MSG roots and finds its true self.  Here, GS really focuses on the characters, in particular the conflict between Kira and Athrun.  Not only them, there was a lot of focus on the various character&amp;rsquo;s conflicts as well as plenty of character development.   Here the action/battles take an even more secondary focus and the characters/narrative clearly becomes the primary focus.  The overall structure of the story improved tremendously as it&amp;rsquo;s no longer linear (from checkpoint to checkpoint); instead GS features a more dynamics story structure.  Pacing for the 2nd half moves even faster and GS rides this momentum until the very end.  However, its not without its faults.  The new antagonist introduced felt like they were introduced for the sake of having Gundam battles/make more toys.  This is due to them being extremely one-dimensional.  Finally, there were quite a few coincidences and illogical moments throughout.  For example, when the odds becomes overwhelming Kira or someone else coming out of nowhere to save the day.  Considering the overall quality of everything else, those moments can easily be forgiven.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before there was a much bigger focus on the characters in GS than in MSG.  For the most part, the characters are multi-dimensional and likeable, the major exception being the newly introduced antagonist in the 2nd half.  Kira in particular has gone through quite a bit of development.  The angst Kira goes through in the beginning is often exaggerated by some people.  If anything Kira is quite admirable, fighting/doing what he has to despite his fears and doubts.  He doesn&amp;rsquo;t let his feelings get in the way of what needs to be done and the only person he&amp;rsquo;s complained/confided in was Fray.  This is unlike Amuro or most of the cast of Zeta where they do whatever they want for no concern for the greater good.  However, Athrun get my vote for most complex and interesting character in GS.  Not only does he have to deal with having his best friend as an enemy, he also has to deal with his father, own beliefs, etc.  Plus he&amp;rsquo;s a badass when it comes to all forms of combat. <br />
<br />
In terms of purely technical merit, GS features good animation and artwork.  Rarely does the quality drop.  My only major complaint would be with the constant use of recycled animation, a major pet peeve of mine.  Also, the action scenes feel a bit uninspired.  Gundam shoots, close up of plot screaming, Gundam does a melee attack, close up of pilot and repeat.  What made these mecha battles more exciting was the excellent and powerful music.  The ost in general is also well done and features some very good insert songs.    <br />
<br />
Another interesting thing to note would be the recap episodes.  Normally, I hate recaps but in the case of GS there were a few that were worth watching.  This is because some of the recap episodes actually add background information to the GS universe.  Nevertheless a recap episode is still a recap episode and they had far too many.  (Not 1 or 2 recap episodes but 4!)     <br />
<br />
I also have to warn the viewer that GS features many references to other Gundam titles and the Gundam universe in general.  References such as newtypes, Char clones, etc will go over the head of viewers not familiar with the Gundam universe.  While its not necessary to watch other Gundams to enjoy GS it will most likely increase one&amp;rsquo;s enjoyment.   <br />
<br />
GS is easily one of the better mecha anime titles I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.  The first half was light and enjoyable with a fast paced plot, albeit very linear.  It feels like the crew of the Archangel was simply moving form checkpoint to checkpoint.  When the 2nd half comes the overall quality increases.  This is partly due to GS becoming its own and really focus on the character/narrative.  The 2nd half was distinctly more serious and dramatic.  Plus it takes its momentum and keeps building and building until the very end.  Animation and art were all top notch, suffering from a few thing namely, recycled animation and slightly uninspired action scenes.  GS also suffered from too many coincidences and illogical moments.  Although, considering the quality of everything else, those things can be ignored.  In the end Gundam SEED is fast paced entertaining watch, but the true strength of Gundam SEED can be found in the 2nd half with its characters.

    Mobile Suit Gundam SEED---an excellent combination of science fiction, mecha, action, drama and romance. This is, indeed, the best gundam series and the best anime I&#039;ve watched in my life!<br />
<br />
There are a variety of reasons why I like this anime. The plot (or the story itself) is well-organized. There are a lot of twists and other shocking revelations in the story, making this a must-seen anime. The role of each character is relevant to the story---each character is connected to one another, making the story more interesting. And besides, the personality of the characters are those in which you can relate to.<br />
<br />
Aside from the wonderful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1314">
        story and the characters involved in it, I also appreciate very much the theme songs used in this anime. In my own opinion, the theme songs are suitable to the anime itself. These songs add more color to the anime. As a matter of fact, these songs are my favorite ones because for me, they convey special messages and at the same time, they have a beautiful tone that when you hear them, you start to have a feeling of relaxation.<br />
<br />
Above of all, you can get a lot of moral lessons or values, especially about friendship, love, and loyalty to your own nation. So you better not miss this anime series for only once in a lifetime comes an anime like this. That&#039;s why I&#039;m giving this anime a perfect overall rating because one thing I can say about this anime is---PERFECT!  <br />
<br />

    This is my first review so I will keep it simple. Gundam seed was the first anime I have seen so I felt it was appropriate that my first review should be about it. Also, please keep in mind that 7 is a good score, as I use 5 as my average.<br />
<br />
STORY: 7/10<br />
The story of Gundam Seed explores in depth the racial issues between genetically enhanced humans (referred to as Co-ordinators) and normal humans. The story itself revolves around Kira Yamato, who is a co-ordinator living as a student in neutral territory. The war between the Earth Alliance and ZAFT (Zodiac Alliance of Freedom Treaty),

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111515">
        the alliance governing the co-ordinators has escalated tremendously and tensions build up as the result of the war is uncertain and with no sight in end. Early forecasts had initially believed that the Earth Alliance would have a complete victory and win the war with sheer numbers, but years have passed and there is no end in sight. Kira Yamato and his friends are involved in a ZAFT attack on neutral territory under the suspicion of developing weapons for the Earth Alliance. Leaving him with no choice, Kira Yamato is forced onto the battlefield in order to protect his friends. During Kira&#039;s journey, he discovers the consequences of his actions and that in order to protect his friends he has killed many people who also have friends and family. Gundam Seed magnificently explores the terrible effects of war and the weight of death is regarded highly as the viewer also experiences grief along with Kira along the journey. Gundam Seed&#039;s backstory is intriguing but the actual journey should not be underestimated. Overall, the story is satisfying and well thought out, demonstrating aspects of ethical issues and racial differences. <br />
<br />
<br />
ART: 4/10<br />
The art style in Gundam SEED takes a unique approach, differing from conventional anime of it&#039;s time. Despite the lacking art clarity (due to being a fairly old series and airing in 2002), Gundam Seed manages to incorporate high level of details that are noticeable even in the background, particularly in battle scenes which more than makes up for the old art. The character designs are fairly standard, and the civilian clothing can be considered somewhat strange, but the actual mecha design and uniform were excellent. The most disappointing factor in Gundam Seed&#039;s art was that it recycled scenes to the point of the audience noticing. Many battle scenes were reused over and over again, appearing many times throughout the course of the anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9/10<br />
One of the strong factors in this anime was the sound. The opening and ending songs were not particularly special but nevertheless accomplishes it&#039;s job. The music was particularly effective during battle scenes, and the viewer can feel the emotions of the music, excitement as the battle was raging, or melancholy as the anime explores the death of a character. The music involved an entire orchestra and are well deserving of the effort developing the music. There is a very large amount of soundtracks used in Gundam SEED, and it never gets too repetitive as there are many variations of each theme and the anime constantly changes between them. Find the Way, by Mika Nakashima became one of my favorite songs, and this song was incorporated into one of the final ending themes. This song had a particularly large impact as the anime was reaching it&#039;s climax and already so many people have died in the war, I feel that his song expresses the feelings extremely well.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 7/10<br />
Another strong point of this anime, the audience is introduced to a wide variety of characters, some of which are particularly lacking in present anime. The main character himself encompasses a charisma that uniquely defines him and differentiates him from other characters. Other characters, despite being supporting characters also display a characteristic that is rarely seen in other anime and the viewer is able to empathize with both sides of the war. Gundam Seed was explored through the views of many characters, and not just through the main character. Furthermore, the characters in Gundam Seed actually felt like real people, they had a presence which showed that they had emotions and flaws in their characters. Every character had emotions, and flaws, even the minor characters.Through the course of the 50 episodes, the viewer finds himself/herself attached to many of the characters in Gundam SEED. <br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9/10<br />
I found myself to enjoy this series greatly, and have rewatched the series several times. Being the first anime I have watched it pleases me to say that I was glad that it was the first anime I have seen.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 7/10<br />
A great anime that has become one of my all-time favourites. The art may take a while to get used to, but a splendid anime nonetheless. The series has been Remastered in HD, but it looks mostly the same. <br />

    I began the series with high hopes; so many have recommended me the series, giving it high marks that I was compelled to watch the series. Once I had the time and was able to borrow the whole series from a friend, I finally sat down and watched it from beginning to end throughout the week. I was surprised to find that this critically acclaimed series could be so disappointing.<br />
<br />
What I find ironic is that the series was meant to be a reboot to bring non-gundam fans or fans that found it difficult to enter the franchise to enjoy this new update to the original

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26667">
        MS Gundam and I found myself wanting to run away from it.<br />
<br />
Story (Spoiler free)<br />
<br />
The beginning episode is a standard First episode - while somewhat introducing the characters that we will see for the foreseeable future, something happens that causes the main character to take a Gundam and protect everyone from the villians.There is a war between the Coordinators and Naturals that was sparked by a nuclear attack that destroyed a colony with many Coordinators. You will get bits and pieces of how the war really started, very little to keep you interested in why they are fighting until near the end where they actually EXPLAIN things. As you go through the first 30 episodes, you just follow the crew as they attempt to survive their journey to their goal; aside from that, there is no story AT ALL: no reasons why they are doing this and that aside from the Bloody Valentine Incident, you don&#039;t really know why they are fighting. <br />
<br />
While I will proclaim that the characters and the action sequences are mid to high quality, to be entertained with random battles when this is a war series and it is frustrating to see that this important ship and Gundam does not influence the War at all. It isn&#039;t until around episode 30 that it felt that the writers and directors had to rush to make the series have somewhat of a plot and to see this rush makes it very uncomfortable and makes the experience unnerving. When you see how things are tied up in the end, you wonder how these characters with little influence in the final episodes are produce significant influence in the &quot;final battle&quot; and the final moments are seen, you are rendered appalled that all the problems are &quot;fixed&quot; in the last few minutes when you expect another episode to really create a satisfying falling action after the &quot;story arc&#039;s&quot; climax.  All in all, it felt as if life has been wasted in those first 30 episodes that the remaining 20 is incredibly disappointing. The pacing is horrible throughout the story arc and through each episode. <br />
<br />
As for the clues such as the SEED, space whales and various other things are discussed one time and never answered at all throughout the series, which leaves you wondering why they were discussed at all but if you think that watching SEED Destiny would help, don&#039;t even consider it at all. After you have seen series such as Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Fullmetal Alchemist, and various other stories that know how to write compelling story arcs with mature themes such as war, suffering, the good times and the bad times, well-placed drama, you will be significantly disappointed by this series.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
You are introduced to a multitude of characters in the beginning but only are actually developed and are interesting. Characters such as Kira, the Gundam Pilot, Fray, the representative&#039;s daughter, Athrun, lead gundam pilot of the Coordinators, Cagalli, a young rebel that has two sides to herself, Capt. Ramius, commanding officer of the ship Archangel, Mu la Fraga, lead pilot protecting the Archangel; These are the only characters that are not as 2-dimensional as the rest of the characters and actually grow somewhat. The rest are so 2-dimensional they keep going to a 1-dimensional level; this permeates through the characters as they are reflective of their respective sides. This is shown on each sides resolve to win the war, &quot;evolving&quot; from the political to just overall racism.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t expect to be impressed by the character development, however, this is one of two only things that actually redeem the series. As for some insignificant characters, such as Lacus Clyne or Azrael (really? They couldn&#039;t think up a better, less obvious name?) that apparently have power, you become disappointed and just concentrate on the characters that actually have merti.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
<br />
Well done, not my favorite character designs such as the eye art but the sequences were well done, even if they do reuse some scenes here and there. I have no complaints on the animation and actually praise the series for it. Obviously, because it is a 50 episode series, there will be a clip show and some episodes won&#039;t be as well animated as others but those are forgivable for the overall quality.<br />
<br />
Music<br />
<br />
Something I didn&#039;t pay attention to but I found it appropriate for the scenes they were implemented; however, they are not as memorable as music from other series. As for the opening and endings, they were well done, great music by their respective artists and fit the tone, especially when the end of the episode transitioned to the ending.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
If you want to get into the Gundam Series, there are way better series than this. Sure, it is an update to the original MS gundam for modern audiences but I would much rather watch the original so I can better enjoy 08th MS Team, Stardust Memory, 0080, and various other series. Because of the length of the series and the frustration many will have with the first 30 episodes, this is one series to stay away from. If you are compelled to watch this series, I suggest to watch the first few episodes, then jump to the clip show that recaps the previous 20-25 episodes and then continue on.<br />
<br />
However, I am completely disappointed and frustrated that I wasted so much time on this series when I could have spent that time on better series.<br />
<br />

    SEED had the makings to be a gundam classic, instead it became the epitome of why people dislike the gundam series. <br />
<br />
From a personal viewpoint, I am a huge gundam fan, I&#039;ve seen every series, and usually enjoy them. This was not the case with SEED.<br />
<br />
To fans of SEED, I apologise for writing a mostly negative review. To people who may be thinking about converting to the Mecha genre, or to people who have grown up watching gundam, take SEED with a grain of salt, you may want to shop around before setting your sights on this series.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story of SEED is almost identical to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21268">
        that of original gundam, with many recurring themes, mecha and unfortunately plot holes. The first gundam series was released in 1979, making it one of the oldest mecha shows to exits. As such, it had a rather lacklustre plot, however, it could be excused because it invented the term &quot;real robot&quot;. SEED has no such excuse. After nearly 25 years, the plot features little improvement. The recurring theme of &quot;Coordinators vs Naturals&quot; is about the only plot device the series entails, and proceeds to extrapolate every aspect of this concept far beyond what would be logical or reasonable. The idea is a good premise, that I want to make clear. But the execution is what drags the series down. The series is plagued with flashbacks, and re-telling of events so many times that it looses any significant value it may have started with. Surely if the war was so important, there would be more than 1 event to flashback? Apparently not. The series uses plot devices that border on the ridiculous. Due to giving away spoilers, and there being too many to list, I&#039;ll refrain from the details (some may mark my review down because of this, I&#039;m wiling to live with that...) <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The main drive behind SEED is the artwork. Googling gundad seed will result in many high-definition shiny CGI models of the main mecha in the show. Unfortunately, this is about all the series amounts to. Most of the mecha are rendered in such a way, that still images are used to perform almost any action sequence. Most of the main mecha have around 3 different animation patters, and the 50 episodes are made up of these attacks played back on different backgrounds. Additionally, there is a substantial drop in quality between still, and live footage. When a mecha shows up for the first time, it will be rendered with a nice and brilliant shine. However, when the mecha moves, the view will be disappointed to see the shine is now gone, replaced with blobs of blue white and red. Other aspects of the artwork include many battle inconsistencies, such as firing dozens of missiles, and only showing three hitting their mark/being shot down. Other aspects of the fight include lasers coming out at 30, 40 degrees from the gun nozzle. This is a prime example of the animators using recycled frames to try and fill a battle, the gundam may be facing straight-on, but it will be firing at enemies above and to the left, without turning the gun. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound, and background music in particular, is very good. I can find little fault with them in this regard. The sound effects also suit the mecha. The voice acting is a little dry, but compared to the other shortcomings of the series, I&#039;m willing to let these aspects go, and say the sound track is very good.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This was an extremely disappointing aspect of the show. Some characters were much too unbelievable to be considered &quot;real robot&quot; pilots. The battles were not won through skill from the main cast, more it was won through complete lack of skill by the minor cast. Almost every mecha pilot, who is not in a gundam, has trouble keeping the robot upright. This makes some of the fights seem like dancing around totem poles, waiting for the poles to randomly fall over trying to watch you dance. Good mehca battles should be fair battles, not overly trivialised cumbersome ones. Piloting skills aside, the rest of the cast borders on annoying. If the viewer can get past the &quot;why are 15 year-olds piloting the best mecha/battleship we own&quot; factor, they are met with conflicting emotions, that run so deep characters can be hugging one minute, stabbing each other the next, and be hugging again in five minutes time. Most of the cast seem to poddle along like a learner driver, trying to figure which gear they need to be in, stalling when the get it wrong, restarting, then doing it all over again. It tried to make characters &quot;real&quot; but served to make them anything but &quot;real&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I&#039;m normally someone to say &quot;enjoy it for what it is&quot;, and I can get through watching the worst of the worst that way. But SEED just featured too many flashbacks, too many recycled frames, and enough plot holes to make swiss cheese jealous. Watching this on DVD, it is clear to see what the company tried to do, they provide 4 episodes per DVD, 3 of these serve as filler, and the 4th serves to have a cliff-hanger to rope people into buying the next DVD... only to have them faced with another 3 episodes of filler. The series also managed to fail at meeting most gundam standards, with the mecha dropping many real robot traits.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
SEED serves as good homage material, showing the infamous &quot;Zaku&quot; to many gundam fans for the first time. But with enormous amounts of filler, the plot, battles and animation quickly become repetitive and dry. Perhaps SEED would have made a good OVA, or 8 episode series. But it was much too long, and suffered from very unbelievable situations to rope together the little plot that didn&#039;t have holes in it.

    Story: The story isn&#039;t bad. It&#039;s certainly quite interesting, with the occasional decent plot twist thrown in. However, even a cursory comparison to the first Gundam series will reveal that it&#039;s far from original. SEED plays it safe - by treading ground already visited by its predecessors. Does it do it better? I can&#039;t say, I&#039;ve never seen the original Mobile Suit Gundam. All I know is that I considered SEED&#039;s tensely plotted, fast-paced storyline to be the best thing about it (no matter what my score says). It drums up excitement and suspense, and (like the whole Gundam franchise) isn&#039;t afraid to show the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3576">
        deadly consequences of war realistically, which is another narrative pro. There&#039;s always conflict in SEED - physical, idealogical and personal - which keeps things interesting.<br />
<br />
Art: Gundam SEED&#039;s art is fairly good. Other than the common anime problem of many characters having awfully similar builds and faces, the designs are good and the animation too. I can&#039;t say I paid much attention to it, though, since I typically don&#039;t consider it especially important. I did spot occurrences of reused animation, especially towards the end. And I don&#039;t mean just a few scenes.<br />
<br />
Sound: I watched the dub. The voice acting is, in my opinion, very good. Apart from minor instances of awkward delivery, the performances completely succeed in conveying emotions and atmosphere. Some of the voices tend to sound annoying, but considering the characters they belong to, that&#039;s actually fitting. The scoring isn&#039;t extraordinary, but still quite good. Especially towards the end, certain tracks help give events a very epic and emotional feel. The opening and ending songs are all generically decent, with some standing above the others a bit. <br />
<br />
Character: This is probably the hardest section to rate. I&#039;ll put it like this: Gundam SEED&#039;s cast of characters can be divided into two. Half of the characters are interesting and likable, the other half make me want to puke. Perhaps I&#039;m exaggerating - most characters I&#039;m indifferent to, there are only several that make me want to puke. But I stand by my view that Gundam SEED has some of the worst, most annoying characters I&#039;ve witnessed in anime. Don&#039;t get me wrong, most of the main cast has some measure of depth and good development; some of them just tend to be impossibly annoying. Flay Allster provided a new definition for uselessness. Lacus Clyne and her bouncing robot tennis balls made me want to punch the screen. And Kira... Oh, boy. The protagonist, Kira Yamato, deserves special attention. <br />
<br />
Quite frankly, Kira is the worst canon Mary Sue I&#039;ve ever seen. The little bastard combines being perfect at everything (an actual character trait) with irritatingly unfailing fighting skills and a smug idiocy that made me root for the enemy. He then tops it off with more of Vitamin Whine than most people can stand. He even worsens other characters, like Cagalli. And yet, SEED shows it can do better, with awesome characters like Mu la Flaga, Murrue Ramius, Natarle Badgiruel, Andrew Waltfeld, etc. They could only do so much though.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This section has very much to do with Characters. To put it bluntly, if SEED had fewer crappy characters, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. There were situations that were almost painful to watch, and I know I&#039;m not the only one. The berserk mode, for instance, unfailingly caused eye-rolling reactions on my part. My enjoyment increased a lot towards the end of the series though, where the climatic battles didn&#039;t leave much room for angst and other annoyances. <br />
<br />
Overall: What can I say? I&#039;m glad I watched Gundam SEED. A lot of bad has been said about it in some circles, which worried me a little. True, a lot of good has been said as well, but that has always come off as fanboyism. SEED isn&#039;t close to being among my favorites, but I liked it well enough. Some pretty good fights and  tense story made sure of that.

    I never had an interest in Gundam before &quot;Mecha! Ewwww! Robots! Yuck!&quot; but this series made me correct myself. And honestly, for me this is one of the best drama animes I have ever watched.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10)<br />
<br />
 No other mecha captivated my heart other that this one. It is very exciting and suspenseful-- characters are forced into difficult situations where any decision they made will always include sacrifices.<br />
<br />
The drama is excellent; characters meeting, fighting and dying in a very sad and surprising way. Another thing is that it focuses on the effect of war and death and its causes to young people who are fighting for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3279">
        the reason adults gave them-- racism, genetic manipulation, genocide and hatred.<br />
<br />
On the negative side, it is not very original since it borrowed a lot of element from earlier gundams. Viewers may find SOME things too coincidental or almost impossible to happen and assume that it is &quot;not deep&quot; because of its story. In short, there were many &quot;miracles.&quot;<br />
<br />
But even with its bad characteristics, I found the story very beautiful, and the climaxes featured in all throughout the series shines out in every aspect.<br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
<br />
Animation is eye-candy--many cute and lovable boys and girls. Fashion of both uniforms and casual wear are lovable and cool. Ships and mobile suits of course are cool looking. A lot of character(or mobile suit) posing or movement are memorable and produces dramatic and artistic effect.<br />
<br />
However, the animation is inconsistent and the characters tend to look like each other at that times. Lots of scenes are re-used--some trademark moves should have been shown at different angles.<br />
<br />
Also, this anime was made in 2002, so its not in high definition.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10)<br />
<br />
Sound is amazing. Because I heard the first ending &quot;Anna ni Issho da atta no ni&quot;, I watched this show that I don&#039;t even plan on watching. The techno- background music are nostalgic, heartwarming: the characters have their image soundtracks which are very helpful. Voice acting is also superb and each character&#039;s voice is memorable and unique to him/her.<br />
<br />
Characte (9/10)<br />
<br />
For me, Gundam Seed has portrayed its themes pretty well; it is not a &quot;trying-hard to be deep&quot; anime. It is true to its purpose: to show war and and its effect on teenagers&#039; problems. This anime is the first one to show me tons of crying scenes with boys--which may seem sissy to others. <br />
<br />
Overall, the worst things about this series are the unnecessary flashbacks, super unnecessary nudities(though only few of them) and an adult scene(only an implication) and overreaction of some characters. But lastly, I love here the most is that there are no presence of an evil or good side, it just shows that in war, all are victims.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, GS&#039; characters are nothing new (but of course the main protagonists have something... special in them in a way). They are just teens with different personalities and unique traits that are strangled by the horrors of war, continually fighting for their lives, their friends, idealistic immature beliefs or for a reason they have not defined. And those wide array of characters meet in ways unexpected. They learn, and mature as the series progresses. Fans may not love all of them, but they are certainly memorable and almost each of them contributes to the overall drama of the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it a lot.This is a must watch for mecha fans and gundam enthusiasts though some may compare it too much to its predecessors. This Gundam series was also hailed as the first one that was loved by fans outside the Gundam realm and liked by many non-mecha fans. Based on reading other reviews, Gundam Seed is not a copy cat at all of the original MS Gundam, it made used a lot of elements at the start but the series eventually it became entirely different later on.<br />
<br />
This is very gender friendly and the characters are very addictive. Yet Lastly, I don&#039;t recommend this to kids.<br />
<br />

    Gundam SEED definitely is one of my favorite animes of all time.  Like all the other Gundam series out there, Gundam SEED has a very intricate plot filled with lots of action.  The one thing that makes Gundam SEED stand out is the balance it finds between story, character development, and the blend of genres.  <br />
<br />
I found this universe to be the most interesting and appealing: a world where genetic engineering has gone to the point of allowing people to choose the genes of their children, resulting in a race called the Coordinators.  But because of their abilities, they are heavily

        discriminated against and a war erupts between the two sides.  The background story makes a lot of sense as well.  Naturals (non-Coordinators) have the advantage in terms of numbers and medicine research while Coordinators have the ability to pilot mobile suits more efficiently and have a faster learning curve with new technology.  The background story is probably what sold me on this series and continually makes it my favorite.<br />
<br />
The plot is a little unbelievable at first but you learn to just go with it.  Kira Yamato gets dragged into the war on the side of the Naturals having grown up in Orb, a neutral colony.  The art is great and there is a lot of character development for all the main characters.  The action is also top notch, sending chills down your spine even if you have seen Gundam series before.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, during the second half of the series, it does get a little repetitive by repeating parts of past episodes and there are a lot of replay fighting shots (i.e. the same angle on the Archangel as it fires its missiles) and the fact that Kira gets the most flexible type of Gundam (Strike has several different modes it can use) is a little cliche.<br />
<br />
Overall, the series is a must see for non-Gundam fans.  Veteran Gundam fans should definitely try it out as well, but it is slightly different from previous series.  The artwork is a lot more modern (at least comparatively) and the characters may not be as likable for hardcore fans.  Nonetheless, Gundam SEED brings a nice balance between action, adventure, sci-fi, and a dash of romance.  People looking for a enjoyable mecha anime have found the best one, at least in the opinion of this reviewer.

    My thoughts haven&#039;t changed much since last year after watching SEED in its entirety and I had dropped this last year after seeing 9 episodes. Like Gundam Wing, this series got a great deal of hype and praise from fans in the early to mid 2000s among Gundam fans. At the same time, there are folks that accuse SEED of being a poor-man&#039;s Gundam 0079 with its blatant rip-off of story elements and structure from the original 1970s series and its nice load of angst and melodrama that are regularly pushed throughout the course of the series. Between my original watch of SEED from last

          <span style="display: none;" id="review116997">
        year and now, I&#039;m gonna have to go with the latter camp.<br />
<br />
I might as well deal with the elephant in the room and address the obvious dilemma with SEED in its blatant use of elements, themes and plot structure from 0079 and several older titles in the Universal Century continuity of the franchise. If you&#039;ve seen your fair share of older Gundam titles, you will see enough parallels in what gets rehashed from UC titles here in SEED. The clashes between humans and enhanced humans with Naturals and Coordinators? That&#039;s a recurring plot element with many later titles in the UC continuity with Oldtypes and Newtypes. The struggle of the lone battleship&#039;s journey to get to allied headquarters against enemy forces with the Archangel? The same thing happened with White Base in 0079. The enemy stealing allied Gundam units here? The same thing was done in Gundam 0083. A great tragedy starting war between Naturals and Coordinators with the Bloody Valentine massacre? Same thing occurred with the 30 Bunch Incident with Zeta Gundam. Kira getting a Gundam upgrade in SEED&#039;s second half? Same thing done in Zeta with Kamille. I could go on, but I don&#039;t want to drag this review out any further than necessary.<br />
<br />
Setting aside its obvious use of Universal Century themes and elements, the series does make some attempt at adding in some new elements to its plot by adding modern issues into the story of the series such as cloning, genetic engineering and nuclear weaponry. Plus, some of the major characters do get enough focus and depth where you know who they are and can care for their issues, like Cagalli and some members among both Naturals and Coordinators. However, this series has a pretty large cast and characterization suffers in this series greatly thanks to SEED&#039;s greater focus on plot development and advancement. Characters who get introduced either get reduced to archetypes, don&#039;t get enough focus for viewers to connect with them or the series rushes through any developments that could have been built up on throughout SEED&#039;s episodes. Like many past Gundam titles, this series has a high kill count with mooks, supporting and even major characters. You&#039;ll be caring less for many of the character deaths here since SEED never bothers to devote enough focus on many of its characters and the nice amount of angst that gets packed during such moments.<br />
<br />
Ah, the angst. SEED loves pushing its angst and melodrama quite heavily at many points throughout its run in its superficial attempts to have you care for the issues faced by the show&#039;s characters. However much like Gundam Wing, the series gets too overbearing with its angst and melodrama where it makes what should be emotional moments pretty irksome and even laughable as characters either get reduced to pathetic angsting messes, screaming out character names if they get killed or get in the habit of spewing random philosophic rhetoric during heated battles in a vain attempt to sound like they are saying something meaningful. The plot does become a bit of a mess in later episodes of the series when multiple story developments get rushed through and resolved during the climactic final battle of the series, as well as trying to toss in some unconvincing romantic pairings among major characters that seemed artificial and lacked natural chemistry. Also, expect some clip shows and recap episodes to pop up at points in the series.<br />
<br />
The animation to SEED is a mixed bag. The series sports a diverse number of scenic shots in space, Earth and on space colonies that are nicely detailed and sport vivid color. Mecha designs look slick and pleasing on the eyes, despite their obvious influence from past Gundam titles and there is some decent use of CG animation in rendering space battleships and weapons moving or being used despite sticking out prominently compared to the cel-shaded animation. However, character designs are a bit on the plain side and the series likes resorting to a nice number of animation shortcuts rather frequently throughout the course of its run such as speed stripes, still shots and reused animation frames. The soundtrack consists of dramatic music inserts and upbeat J-Pop tracks used for OP and ED tracks that are pleasing on the ears, do well at flowing at whatever scenes they are played in and is perhaps the highlight of the series for me.<br />
<br />
Overall, I feel Gundam SEED is just as overhyped as Wing in being a quality addition to the Gundam franchise thanks to its complete ripping of major elements and plot structure from Gundam UC titles, its heavy reliance on angst and melodrama, limited depth and focus on many of its characters and rushed later episodes. You would be better off watching Turn A Gundam if you are looking for a good quality alternate continuity title in the Gundam franchise.

The characters are amazing! It&#039;s really hard to put in words how awesome this anime series is but it&#039;s defintely worth seeing over and over again. WATCH IT!!! lol

    Gundam seed is one of my All time fav anime :)  it was very enjoyable watching this anime. <br />
<br />
Story: the story of gundam seed is about a cordinator, named Kira yamoto, who somehow pilots the so-called &#039;&#039;gundam&#039;&#039;. it is a battle between ZAFT and Earth alliance, and Kira was forced to join Earth alliance to fight ZAFT even though Kira is a cordinator, Kira and the rest of the crew in Archangel, later figures the Earth alliance&#039;s evil deeds and are unclear of what they are fighting for. it is very intresting how Kira find out many things happened to and related to him,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6055">
        especially about his sister.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound: i quite like this animation :) very good, not alot of echi and not alot of wearidness where the character just look totally awful. I like the way the animation developed over-over time and the gundams :) However, they sometimes uses repeat scenes of gundams fighting :) which brings it down a little :) <br />
<br />
Character: I like the personalities of Kira, he&#039;s quiet and kind, isn&#039;t perverted and OVER-kind, he&#039;s strong on the outside, maybe because he pilots the gundam, but he&#039;s actually weak inside (and scared) As of Female characters, Cagali is my fav :) i like her personality and her looks ^.^ honestly, i love Cagali that much :) as for lacus, she&#039;s the second :) the person dubbed her english voice is just wonderful, she&#039;s the princess of princesses :) The character i totally hate is hmm i cant remember her name... kira&#039;s first girlfriend... she&#039;s totally a badass, and i hate her dubbed voice. :) <br />

Enjoyment eah?: This anime is totally awsome. :) i loved it verymuch and it is very entertaining. maybe because i&#039;m a alltime gundam fan. I watched Gundam Seed Destiny before this so i know alot of things happened before even watching this. even so i rated the enjoyment 10/10 because it just is very enjoyable :) I like how they linked abit of Romance into Gundam Seed even though it only says its &#039;&#039;action&#039;&#039; :)<br />
<br />
Overall: I Recommand this anime to anyone who is bored of those sadass romance animes, watch Gundam Seed. it&#039;s a sad-ass-action anime :) <br />
<br />

    On February 14th, Anime News Network added all 50 episodes of the 2002 entry of Sunrise&#039;s long-running Gundam franchise to watch for free on their website. As part of my crusade to watch all of the Gundam TV shows before I die, I picked up Mobile Suit Gundam Seed. One month and nine days later, I&#039;ve seen all 50 episodes and it&#039;s an experience I don&#039;t regret, although the show could&#039;ve been stronger in several areas.<br />
<br />
The story can easily be divided into two parts. The first part is a loose remake of the original Mobile Suit Gundam and arguably the weaker part of the series.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24271">
        Several characters from the original series are copied here. For instance, Mu La Flaga is definitely meant to be a combination of some elements from Ryu and Bright from the original series. Rau Le Crueset is undoubtedly similar to Char Aznable but with more of a pessimistic view of humanity. <br />
<br />
This re-usage of character types is both a good and bad thing. Good because the character types are familiar and can be easily related to, yet bad because the writers don&#039;t bring anything new to the table and thus have trouble giving several of these characters unique personalities.<br />
<br />
When these characters clash, the drama all too often feels heavy handed. Our leads (especially Kira) literally spend episodes on end crying over things that, instead of making them stronger, only make them look weak as our leads. In the case of Kira, how could anyone entrust their life to a kid insecure with his own identity? Or is it because he always pilots THE most powerful Gundam throughout the show and he can just use them the best?<br />
<br />
Another major fault of this show is the rather shoddy animation. Several shots are repeated over and over, with the animators eventually resorting to taking animation from the openings themselves. It doesn&#039;t help that 3 or 4 episodes around the halfway mark are recap episodes, a time when this show truly became a chore to watch.<br />
<br />
Still, there are good qualities to this show namely the second part of the series. This is when Gundam Seed branches off into its own thing. Once the war between the Naturals and the Coordinators enters the spotlight, the show honestly becomes a thrill. The fights reach high levels of intensity, the drama less heavy-handed (not by much, though) and some characters become much more rounded. The final battle is one of the most exciting fights I&#039;ve seen in an anime ever, spanning the last two and a half episodes and chock full of amazing Gundam action.<br />
<br />
Another plus this show has is its amazing score. From the very catchy opening themes to the soaring soundtrack composed by the talented Toshihiko Sahashi, the music may very well be this show&#039;s strongest point.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to keep going on and on, so I&#039;ll cut it short here. Gundam fans should receive mild enjoyment from this show. Its stern commentary of war is admirable and provides for an interesting and intelligent watch near the end. All the die-hard fans have to do is stick through the show&#039;s weak beginning. Now obviously, this show was made for a casual fan with very little Gundam knowledge like myself. Die-had fans need to keep in mind that that&#039;s not a bad thing. If this show can get new fans involved in the franchise, then so be it.<br />
<br />
Now, onto Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny...

    Hey there. I give this anime a lot of good points but don&#039;t be fooled. For any anime fan this would be a good show, but to the true Hardcore Gundam fan, it&#039;s a complete upset.<br />
<br />
It seems our guys in Japan are runing out of new Gundam ideas, ever since they started to over do it on the Gundams (thanks alot G Gundam!!). What I mean is, they placed too many Gundams in one series, that&#039;s one of many defalts. In Mobile Suit Gundam, there should only be one (or two, depends on the story), like the Highlander. The Gundam is to be seen as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111">
        the most powerful weapon. Of course they make that obvious but too obvious. The Gundams in these shows are ridiculously powerful, what happened to the Original Gundam concept? They turned a real mecha concept into a super mecha concept, and Gundam shouldn&#039;t be that way.<br />
<br />
Another thing that caught my attention was that they were reviving the Universal Century world and changing it&#039;s name to Cosmic Era. At first I thought that would be okay but after they added five Gundams I was oh boy, then adding even more Gundams....god dam them. Making too many Gundams like that ruins the series.<br />
<br />
Even though the anime was good and the art design was very well done, what pissed me off the most was it&#039;s really annoying characters. All of them are complaintive baby faced loosers!! Amuro would have no problem taking these upstarts down. <br />
<br />
All in all, the story:  good, designs: nice, concept: over done, characters: to annoying, and over all: well you can obviously see it. I&#039;d watch it again but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll get pissed or happy. Don&#039;t expect Seed Destiny to be any different, it&#039;s teenage angst is way over. Hopefully Stargazer will replenish the Fans. I&#039;m sticking to Universal Century. <br />
<br />
PS<br />
<br />
Gundam Seed Astray is actually way better then the Original Story line.

    Energetic and pacey, the first opening theme of &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; captures the feel of the anime perfectly. With so much action, drama and tragedy, it doesn&#039;t take a genius to see why this is such a highly regarded show in the mecha genre.<br />
<br />
With an aggressive opening sequence of events, the tone is set from the very first episodes when two close friends Kira and Athrun find themselves caught up on opposite sides of an outbreaking war. And it&#039;s one hell of a war, one that is both epic and tragic, where there are no &quot;right&quot; sides, and where people are forced to choose between conflicting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28705">
        feelings and loyalties. The strength of &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; lies in its portrayal of war, both in terms of production values and the ideals that drives it. For a 50-episoder, it&#039;s mightily impressive that its story rarely feels like it&#039;s dragging its feet. It&#039;s a rollercoaster of a ride from start to finish with plenty of heroic deaths and shocking twists along the way. For enjoyment value, &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; easily ranks amongst the heavy weights. <br />
<br />
The music deserves special mention for its excellent quality. Though the opening and ending themes, with the exception of the first OP &quot;Invoke&quot;, aren&#039;t spectacular, the background music really really shines through. There are two main aspects to the depiction of war in &quot;Gundam Seed&quot;: the collossal feel of its political struggles and spectacular mecha battles, and the human, emotional drama underneath. The background music plays a giant part by creating exactly the right kind of atmosphere for both these aspects. For the first, the soundtrack provides a number of suitably grand pieces. During the awesome battles scenes, the powerful, swelling orchestral score is in perfect fusion with the explosive action sequences to make the whole experience positively exhilarating. The more touching scenes, often teeming with raw, human emotions, are also intensified by the heart felt instrumentals in the background. The through the roof production values also throws up numerous other small pleasures. I especially like the way the episodes tend to naturally fade into the ending credits/theme, and also the returning eyecatch really caught my er... eye (and ear) with its enchanting ballerina in a music box effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gundam Seed&quot; shouldn&#039;t be dismissed as all flash and melodrama though, because underneath all the gloss and the theatrics, it has a surprising amount of substance in its war-related themes. The web of motives and ideals of the cast is not just complicated, but in constant change throughout the course of the series, and &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; does remarkably well in mapping them out clearly and making them easy to understand. One of the series&#039; strength is painting everything in shades of grey rather simplifying issues down clear differences of black and white. It&#039;s clear that there are no &quot;right and wrong&quot; sides to this war - none of the parties involved in it are completely bad, nor completely innocent in general. The naturals may have fired the first shot, fueled by their hatred born from prejudice and fear of the genetically enhanced &quot;artificial&quot; Coordinators, who they barely view as human beings, but the Coordinators struts around with a certain air of arrogance and superiority, and seeks the total extermination of the Naturals, who they see as threats to their existence. Even as I despised the leaders of both sides for being so manipulative and deceiving the masses with their hatred propaganda, &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; made me sympathise with the more ordinary, helpless people caught up in the war against their will, as well as the lower ranked soldiers who are often torn between obeying orders and upholding their own ideals and moral principles. By focusing on these kind of people from both sides of the war, and showing them becoming more and more disillusioned, questioning the reasons that they fight for, it really makes it difficult to decide who to root for. <br />
<br />
Prejudice is a theme that features heavily in &quot;Gundam Seed&quot;. It manifests in different levels of severity. At the worst level it&#039;s systematic prejudice, the kind that give rise to irrational hatred and triggers off wars. But the anime took pains to illustrate that even the nice, ordinary, sensible people like Kira&#039;s classmates are not totally unsucceptible to these feelings now and then. When push comes to shove, even they can display the unpalatable taint of prejudice. At the most subtle level, it&#039;s actually unclear what&#039;s right and what&#039;s wrong. For example, upon hearing a Coordinator sing in an incredibly beautiful voice, is it really so wrong to wonder whether this is due to genetic enhancements? It&#039;s a similar kind of question to how far political correctness should be taken to, and &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; does a sublime job of presenting this kind of dilemma.<br />
<br />
While most of the cast of &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; are thoughtfully fleshed out (though admittedly I didn&#039;t take a particular liking to any of them, nor did any of them seem particularly interesting, thus the relatively low score I gave for the characters), there a few that are a little subpar. One of these is the popstar Lacsus. To start off with, she seems to play the role of a sweet, naive pop princess (&quot;Really? Am I really not allowed to go wandering around on a warship belonging to an enemy nation?&quot;) with pink hair that matches her personality perfectly. Halfway through, the producers appeared to change their mind about what kind of character they want her to be, and so she ended up suddenly maturing into a personality that&#039;s more suitable for her ambassador role. I didn&#039;t find this change of personality particularly convincing.<br />
<br />
Also, le Cruz comes off as just another one of those &quot;one dimensionally crazy bad guys who just want to destroy the world coz he&#039;s crazy&quot; type of character. Speaking of le Cruz, the unravelling of his mysterious background is brilliantly executed, but having uncovered it, I struggle to figure out its relevance to the story. And here we move to the series&#039; weakest point - the unexplained significance of le Cruz&#039;s background (there may be none, of course, but the build up to this feels so deliberate that I have trouble getting my head to accept this idea) is just one of many unexplained or badly explained plot points. On one occasion this resulted in such a jarring experience that I had to briefly skim back through a couple episodes to convince myself that I didn&#039;t just accidently skipped past an episode and missed some crucial story development. One aspect they really should have dwelled upon some more is the whole Seed thing. I only really touched on it without going into details. I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s supposed to have any connections with those Berserker pilots. (Speaking of those, is it just me, or does it seems like every good guy and their dog turn out to be Berserkers by the end?!) <br />
<br />
In addition, even though the storyline itself isn&#039;t exactly slow paced, its progression does often get bogged down by repeats of previously shown events. The repeats, which are not presented in the form of flashbacks, are both more frequent and longer than necessary and some are so bad that I&#039;m not sure whether they are meant to be recap episodes or not. I&#039;m a pretty patient viewer generally, but even I was a bit restless sitting through all of those. Those partial recap episodes practically disappear during the later stages of the series, which just makes me think the earlier ones are just stalling for time so they don&#039;t break the &quot;Gundam series must be 50 episodes long&quot; golden rule. I wouldn&#039;t have minded seeing a more detailed explanation of the story if they had so many episodes to spare.<br />
<br />
Apart from the that, the rest of my complaints are mostly minor. They include things like Lacsus&#039; overrated songs; the rather unusual character design that takes a bit of getting used to; the horrific noises the characters make when crying; the uncalled for fanservice in the opening credits which made it look like there was going to be a lot of fiery romance in it, which there isn&#039;t; then there are all those Gundam cliches (well it is a Gundam after all) - the obligatory man in mask, the practically invincible hero, the ridiculously overpowered Gundams etc. Also, while the &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; is well dramatised in general, it is guilty of being a little overly melodramatic at times, especially with the somewhat stereotypical overly emotional female characters who annoyed me sometimes with their over the top reactions. With the most trivial of events enough to make them squawk, go all tearful and dish out bear hugs, it does make some of the character interaction slight cringeworthy to watch. In addition, &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; is also occasionally guilty of the Saikano Syndrome, where some of the characters seem to do stupid things for no apparently reason other than to create more drama and tragedy for the series, like during the battle involving the Desert Tiger.<br />
<br />
Still, this is mostly nit-picking, because ultimately, &quot;Gundam Seed&quot; gets it spot on when it matters. The excitement, the drama, the action can all be regarded as close to the very best on offer in its genre. It may not be the most perfect of anime, and may not leave a long lasting impression (my extremely good impressions of it went stale rather quickly afterwards), but its strong points and the sheer passion contained within it is more than enough to make it stand out from the crowd. Even if you&#039;ve been avoiding the Gundam franchise, you might still find yourself pleasantly surprised by this offering.<br />

*SPOILERS FOR GUNDAM SEED. I WILL BE REVIEWING THE 2011 HD REMASTER. TO ANY DIEHARDS OUT THERE, PLEASE DO NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH THE FACT THIS GOT A SCORE LESS THAN 9 OR 10? ALSO, PLEASE WARD OFF SEED HATERS FROM ATTACKING ME DUE TO ME ONLY GIVING IT A DECENT SCORE?*<br />
<br />
Ah, Gundam SEED. One of the more vocally divisive Gundam shows out there despite having a higher MAL score than most Gundam shows. I have a weird experience with this show, and honestly, the tone of this review will likely flop between positive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220598">
        and defensive, and cynical and negative. There is a LOT to talk about regarding my experiences of this show, and let me say, I wanted to put this down several times in the first half. Also, this is melodrama incarnate. Not much of a hyperbole there. Now, was it worth it, or did it blow up in red mobile suit smoke? Let&#039;s find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
STORY: 5/10<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the premise. A group in space declaring hostility against the Earth Federation, the group attacking a civilian base in the Federation, only for our protagonist to find a Gundam during the time his neighbors are dying, and stops the attack only to find out he must now join an army after most of the civilians in his area have died. That&#039;s right. If you&#039;ve caught on, you would know that this show starts off as a ripoff of the original Mobile Suit Gundam. The rest of the show is about two coordinators forced to fight in opposite sides of a war as they make friends and hope to not have to kill each other. Also, there are plenty of politics, not just between the two sides, that being Earth and the PLANTS, but also between Earth and ORB and even among ORB members, Earth forces, and PLANT forces. It is interesting seeing many attempts to stop this war with minimal bloodshed and with more diplomacy. That, and there are some really strong moments in the story, like in episode 29 or 27 for the HD remaster. However, there are a good number of gaping plot holes throughout, and they get increasingly large throughout, and it dosen&#039;t even TRY to explain or hand wave anything like with Code Geass or Gurren Lagann, not that hand waving disagreeable plot points is a good thing. <br />
<br />
The SEED mechanic is the biggest deus ex machina crap ever, since we don&#039;t even know the FIRST THING about it other than it being a voluntary-ish deus ex machina. Also, the finale in particular has a few ass pull moments that would rival those of Gundam 00 2nd season. However, it does pose some interesting politics and moral ideologies, the latter of which, if done even remotely correctly like with this show, can really help an otherwise flawed as frig plot such as this. Also, expect some horrific cases of Sunrise&#039;s bring characters back to life/ don&#039;t kill off characters when they have no chance of survival. Believe me, the latter happens to the protagonist TWICE, and the former actually happens to one minor antagonist in particular, and believe me, they use these a lot in this show, and it&#039;s almost maddening in certain situations. Plus, the execution of the ending was kinda dumb, and even has that whole deal Sunrise does that I just mentioned. Plus, the melodrama is extreme, and more often then not, not worth it. They should&#039;ve really toned it down at points.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 6/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be upfront. The characters in the first half bothered me for most part, particularly in the second cour. However, they certainly got a lot better in the second half, even with a few things wrong here and there... Now, Kira Yamato. His moral compass towards the middle of the first half becomes such an unbelievable moral compass, that he actually becomes rather unlivable at points, however, thanks to Andy, a charismatic antagonist with a bleak yet common (in this show at least) viewpoint of war, Kira actually reflects on his actions and moral compass, and becomes a more cohesive individual because of it. Many side characters aren&#039;t that special but are decent none the less, except Mu La Flaga. He was kinda cool. There are two I need to mention though. Sai. Poor Sai. Got treated poorly by Flay, and got his ass nearly kicked by Kira, and disappeared for most of the final arc for some reason. Literally, he&#039;s hardly even there at all for the last 10 episodes. As for Flay, *SIGH* oh boy. She is so damn useless and bitchy. She literally contributes nothing but drama, and that&#039;s what makes her a faulty character rather that a character who we&#039;re supposed to hate for the right reasons. Now, some of the villains actually have a point in their messed up ideals, but don&#039;t have a whole lot going for them aside from Andy, and the most prominent antagonist, Le Cruset, who gives us an ASTOUNDING performance in the last 7 episodes. There is also Arthrun, who&#039;s probably the best protagonistic character here. His comrades, are mostly good at their job as characters and pilots, except for Yzak, but even he improves towards the end. There&#039;s also Lacus, who&#039;s songstress idol part of her character is underutilized, and has a drastic and not built up surge of maturity around episode 34. Unfortunately, for episodes 8-20, I could not stand a lot of these people, and that&#039;s a big problem with the second cour in particular, even if, like I said, the second cour actually makes many of them actually tolerable.<br />
<br />
ART: 3/10<br />
<br />
For the good, there&#039;s the Gundams and other Mobile Suits. They look cool, and many of the battles, especially in the last 5 episodes, look pretty cool, especially those laser effects in those last 5 episodes, not to say they didn&#039;t look good before, because they did, but it&#039;s obvious that they pulled all the stops in the last 5 episodes. At points, the character models can look ok. <br />
<br />
For the bad, just about everything else. The character models look so damn wonky. Back in the mid-2000&#039;s, many companies tried their hand at digital animation, but for the most part, failed to get it right until 2006 with shoes like Haruhi and Code Geass using it to excellent effect. This show, Gundam SEED, highlights just how bad it can get. The facial expressions look horrendous at many points, and it takes a while to even adjust to the wonky digital models. Hell, there is a lot of Studio Sunrise&#039;s trademark animation recycling going on, especially with the openings and fight scenes, way more than normal, and that is just unacceptable. Also, the CGI is hideous and poorly integrated a whole lot, especially in the first half. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 6/10<br />
<br />
The OST, is pretty good with many well done emotional pieces, and Lacus&#039;s song that&#039;s sung a few times, (&quot;In this quiet night&quot;) is good too. Now, OP 1 and OP 2 both kinda suck. They are pretty weak despite some cool points. Now, OP 3, is pretty damn awesome, and actually gets pretty catchy. OP 4 is very nice and just perfect as a way to encapsulate the final stretch of this anime as it just feels like something nice and emotional and gratifying coming to an end (even if this show up until the final cour has been kinda bad), making it just as good as OP 3. Now, for ED 1, it also fails at being an emotional piece. ED 2 for the original, is pretty. Now REMASTER ED 2 on the other hand, is definitely a great emotional ED, and I loved it. Now, ED 3, which only plays once in the HD version, is decent enough. Now, the dub. It&#039;s awful.Most of the voices are downright terrible, and they even swapped the good sound effects of the original with some crappy stock sound effects just to censor this for young Cartoon Network audiences, which this show can only really cater to anyone over the age of 13. Damn Bandai dub.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 5/10<br />
<br />
The first 7 episodes left me believing that this show would be pretty good. However, most of the episodes from the range of 8-20 infuriatied me and I nearly dropped it. Luckily most of 21-28 was decent afterward, especially with Andy. Then, most of the episodes after that were actually pretty alright, sometimes even good, minus the plot holes. The battles got progressively better for the most part as well. Still, that second cour was hell. Can&#039;t forgive that...<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 5/10   RAW SCORE: 49/100<br />
<br />
Overal, I was kinda disappointed in some areas, and even with how cool the 2nd half got at times, it just has too many major plot holes to be truly good, and the characters aren&#039;t that great either, mostly. That&#039;s not to say that I thought this was a genuinely bad series, but he first half definitely hindered this series as a whole, and the plot holes are egregious. Sure, the fights got cooler as the show progressed, but the second cour, man did it leave me sour! Still, after that it grew much nore tolerable and fun, even if the plot in that half got worse. Even still, I can see why some people do praise this series. It has some decent conflicting ideals and actually tries it&#039;s hand at politics in war and had characters make peaceful attempts at resolutions. I just wish it was less derivative and full of infuriating melodrama and awful character art and CGI. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu.

    Gundam SEED is part of Sunrises very popular Gundam series. Gundam SEED takes place at cosmic era.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Story was mixed bag. First ~15 eps were rather boring but when events moved to earth story took more speed. From 30 onwards it was so addicitive that I watched last 20 eps in one day. Theme was rather generic (two sides at war) but it had some interesting details so it didn&#039;t bother me. Story was easy to understand and had some nice twists.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This section is one of the big positive things in this series. Characters were easy to like (expect Flay...god I hated her) and they had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14391">
        some emotions unlike in some other series. Characters had some deveploment through the series which was nice to see. First Kira battled only for his friends but when story goes foward he unterstand why he needs to fight. Other characters have also nice deveploment within series. Some of the main characters may seem unrealistic like Lacus. So beatifull and kind pink haired princess but it didn&#039;t bother me because I am not looking realism from anime. I see it enough when I walk on the streets at the city. Another positive thing is that in this series main female characters had something other meaning than look pretty and cry for main male characters. Cagalli fighted in front lines and Lacus had her own way to impact to the war. Using her song voice and authority. If I had to marry some anime girl it would be lacus. So beatifull, kind and innocent.... I loved her.<br />
<br />
Artwork&amp;Animation:<br />
Art and animation were really nice done when you consider that this series was made 2002. Gundams looked cool and expecially main characters were well made and animated. Some secondary characters had some flaws but nothing major. Battle animations were recycled a lot but it didn&#039;t bother me. Overall all was nice.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
This is easily the strongest area in this series. The second best soundtrack ever in my opinion. Only the sequel GSD has better. All songs fitted well in the series (Battle songs were great) and all opening and ending songs were one of the best ever. SEED had enertic battle songs and it had awesome peacefull songs (singed by Lacus). Awesome balance.  Pure gold.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I enjoyed this series a lot. Beginning may be slow like I said but when it takes some speed it doesn&#039;t let you go. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Overall really good mecha anime. I had my own assumptions for this series before I watched it because it had got so much crap from internet. Gladly I forced myself to watch this anime. From this onwards I watch series before I make my judgements. I recommend this anime if you have even little interest towards mecha series and even if you generally dislike mecha series this series wasn&#039;t all about fighting. Story was decent and this had nice charactes. Very good overall.<br />

    Out of all the Alternative Gundam Timelines, the Cosmic Era is seemed to the one to get the most hate from hardcore Gundam fans. The negative feedback was so strong that many people especially hardcore Gundam fans call this the joke timeline. When I  just finished the Build Fighters series as well Wing I decided to check out Gundam Seed and I originally watched it just to see how bad it was however once I was done with Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny I quickly came to a conclusion that while the Cosmic Era is indeed a pretty bad compared to the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295909">
        timelines, however, I don’t think that Gundam Seed Season 1 is as bad as everyone says it is. Don’t get me wrong Gundam Season 1 is still an average show that has a lot of mediocre to subpar moments but I don’t think it’s as a bad as something like Wing, 00 Movie, G Savoir, ZZ Gundam, Build Divers and Build Fighters Try.<br />
This review will only cover Gundam Seed Season 1 meaning I won’t mentioning Gundam Seed Destiny at all. Now with that said let’s begin.<br />
<br />
Story and Characters.<br />
It is the year 70 of the Cosmic Era, the war rages on. On one side is the Earth Alliance, and on the opposite is the space colonies that form ZAFT (Zodiac Alliance of Freedom Treaty). Mankind is divided over human genetic engineering, with normal humans known as ‘Naturals’ and the genetically altered humans known as ‘Coordinators’. ZAFT has a head start on mobile suit design; the Earth Alliance quickly catches up with its five prototype Gundam’s. With ZAFT having stolen four of the prototypes, young pilot Kira Yamato takes the Strike Gundam and is forced to fight his old friend Athrun Zala. Little do they know that there are sinister forces at work that go far beyond their worst nightmares.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the story of Gundam Seed is average at best.<br />
<br />
To start off with Gundam Seed, for the most part, reuses story and characters elements in Gundam 0079. Two factions are at war with each other, the first battle is in a colony, the main protagonist and his friends get caught up in the middle of the war etc. While I understand that the creators of Gundam Seed were trying to pay a homage to Gundam 0079 aka the first Gundam series, however, I felt that Gundam Seed played it too safe with this and as a result the show ended up being a poor man’s Gundam 0079.<br />
Another thing that I didn’t about Gundam Seed are the flashbacks. Personally, I don’t mind flashbacks as long they are done right but this show really got carried away with this and it really screws up the pacing of the show. While it’s not as bad here when compared to Seed Destiny it’s still pretty annoying.<br />
The series explores the themes of genetic manipulation were individuals who had their DNA modified before birth struggle to coexist with people who are born with natural jeans. While the idea itself was a great and unique way to go over the themes of racism however the execution was sadly mediocre at best mainly because it ended up being pretty preachy. Not only that I was also not a fan of how they made the actual war more like a good vs evil type of story rather than a battle of ideology. If you don’t count G Gundam the franchise has never been a battle between good vs evil. This also hurts the overall narrative of the show as it quickly became predictable in a bad way thanks to its story structure.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters of Gundam Seed I thought they were mostly forgetful.<br />
Now I kinda like Kira Yamato in the beginning because I thought he was kinda of character you sympathize with due to him being the only coordinator in the archangel who had no choice to fight against his own people including his best friend Athurn. I personally found that concept to redundant when considering that Turn A the Gundam series that came out before Seed has already used this idea. Now for Kira himself, I actually liked him for the first half of the series despite him being whiny at times. Unfortunately, at a certain point of the series, Kira character development gets thrown out of the window and by the second half, he becomes a full fleshed Gary sue.<br />
<br />
Overall Kira had the potential to be a decent protagonist but when he became a Gary sue he became a wasted potential character.<br />
Athrun, in my opinion, was the highlight of Seed season 1 for me due to him having the best character development as well as actual flaws that make sense not to mention he actually a very likeable chararter, unlike Kira who just devolves into a Gary Sue.<br />
<br />
Lacus was a decent character in the beginning but Jesus Christ does her Mary Sue levels just sky rocked as the show progressed. Plus it to a point where she becomes kinda insufferable to watch due to her being perfect at everything.<br />
<br />
Cagalli is pretty good chararter overall. She may be a crybaby at times but least she is a pretty decent character who gets decent character development.<br />
As for the other characters I honestly don’t have much say about them mainly because of they all pretty forgetful minus Mu la Flaga and Andrew Waltfeld.<br />
Overall the story and characters in Gundam Seed are average at best. While the story has some cool moments that kinda interesting a bit as well as having a couple of characters that I liked, however, would have been a lot better if it was better executed.<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Visuals.<br />
Visually Gundam Seed is okay at best.<br />
It may look very colourful and pretty to look at for the most part but in terms of actual designs for characters I found it to be lacking in a lot of areas.<br />
The CGI not counting the HD Remaster version was pretty horrendous to look at it clearly stands out from the background scenery. The facial structure of the chararters is pretty inconstant as well the chararter models frequently go off model to a point where they look like chararters that came out straight from a hentai production.<br />
The animation itself is mediocre which can also get a bit choppy at times and let’s not forget the fact that is stock footage here and it can be almost as bad as Wing and Build Fighters Try depending how you look at.<br />
The HD remaster of Gundam Seed has fixed some of the issues that I had with the visuals but they didn’t fix everything that was wrong.<br />
The mecha designs were pretty okay for the most part, however, I will admit that many of them were unoriginal especially the Freedom Gundam.<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
If there’s one thing that I really liked about Gundam Seed it the music.<br />
The soundtrack in the show is flat out amazing that is filled with great tracks left and right that fits well with the overall tone of the series. Not to mention the insert songs were pretty awesome to listen.<br />
All of the opening the ending themes of Gundam Seed are amazing and very memorable to the eye from both the original and HD remaster version.<br />
Now for sub vs dub.<br />
The sub is pretty good for the most part as every Seiyuu did a pretty solid job with the roles that they were given. The dub, on the other hand, is kinda decent however there were some questionable dub performances.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
Gundam Seed may not be the best Gundam series I have ever seen nor do I think it’s one of the worst Gundam series I have seen.<br />
The story while having some pretty good to decent moments was pretty average to overall mediocre execution. The chararters ranged from alright, annoying to forgetful, the visuals were okay at best and the music was awesome.<br />
The Cosmic Era of Gundam may get a lot from hardcore Gundam fans but I don’t think that the Cosmic Era of Gundam was a total disaster. The Cosmic Era had a lot of potential and the original Seed showed some good signs of that potential however it was pretty mismanaged.<br />
Which version should you Gundam Seed? I personally recommend the HD remaster version of the show as its more cleaner, has fewer recap episodes and it fixes some of the animation issues,<br />
<br />
I highly recommend avoiding the original versions because besides of having a decent dub it’s has a lot of powerpoint presentation fights, more stock footage than the HD remaster version and no to mention it has more recap episodes.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t seen any Gundam show before or if you’re a fan of the modern Gundam shows such as 00, Build Fighters and Iron-Blooded Orphans than this would be a decent watch and enjoyable watch however if you&#039;re are a fan of more older Gundam shows such as U.C Gundam, Turn A, X or G Gundam it’s best to approach to this with caution.<br />
After the release of Gundam Seed, the Gundam franchise would sadly fall in the rabbit hole as the next Gundam show I will be covering will bearly have any positive praise but what the original Gundam Seed was it was a pretty alright experience.<br />
<br />
Final Score 5/10
