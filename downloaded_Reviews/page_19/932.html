    I have never understood why Overlord receives so much praise. <br />
<br />
It is practically a generic isekai light novel adaptation, but with older characters, giving it the illusion of maturity. Overlord is not mature, it&#039;s not remotely well written, it&#039;s visuals don&#039;t even look good. The character designs look cool, and all but that isn&#039;t enough to carry a boatload of mediocrity. Both this season and the first were at best disposable entertainment, like any other isekai light novel adaptation. What&#039;s the appeal of it? Is it that Momonga is a ridiculously overpowered self-insert protagonist and his legion of ladies all want him?<br />
<br />
Momonga is a typical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276674">
        isekai protagonist. An overpowered character doesn&#039;t become good just by not being a teenage boy. Skeleton or kid, there is no difference. Skeletons are cool and all. I like them as much as the next guy, but he&#039;s not a very interesting character beyond his intimidating design. He is entirely devoid of substance, only existing to continue the story. Even his character art fails at conveying the intimidation. The light novel&#039;s designs look amazing—but this adaptation&#039;s art lacks detail. His skeleton face remains unanimated in conversations; his voice is undeniably booming, the actor puts on a fantastic show, but there&#039;s no impact. <br />
<br />
Momonga being a villain changes almost nothing. Everyone still loves him anyway, and he acts like the generic &#039;nice guy&#039; harem protagonist. He&#039;s always speaking in his friendly guy voice in his head to remind us, he&#039;s not actually a real villain. It&#039;s lovely how nice of a guy he is really–wait, stop right there... If the villain protagonist isn&#039;t even a villain, then this show is literally just the same as anything else… Like the meek voice hiding behind the intimidating demonic skeleton exterior, Overlord masquerades as something far better and more original than it actually is. The philosophy of: &quot;How can I self-insert if my main character isn&#039;t a good guy?&quot; breaks any potential this show had to become something original.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s funny how Overlord shamelessly admits that its female characters are coded to love Momonga, but that doesn&#039;t make it better writing. A story&#039;s world should ebb and flow without the audience needing to be there. Here it feels like a pandering fest; the characters bend over backward to praise Mr. Skeletor, he wins nearly every fight, and there is no substance.<br />
<br />
This new season of Overlord isn&#039;t all harem bullshit; it tries a few new things… and fails at all of them. For some reason, whenever the story follows any character other than Momonga, it becomes insufferably dull. We got classic stories to be loved for ages, like the tribe of lizard idiots who inevitably get taken over by Momonga, the compelling backstory for Momonga&#039;s butler (aka Plank of Wood), some random knight guy, and a princess with a dark secret! Remember how Overlord&#039;s first season had somewhat slow pacing at times? This is 10 times worse! Entire episodes are dedicated to characters that we don&#039;t have a reason to care about. We&#039;re forced to watch them fighting in their own battles, with their own drama, and all of it barely connected to the characters introduced in the first season. In the end, the stories come together, but does the moderately entertaining end justify the tiresome means? Not at all. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s rare for anime to put me to sleep, but Overlord&#039;s first three (lizard focused) episodes truly tested my fortitude. The only plausible reason for the story breaking off from Ainz to follow the lizard people is to keep his harem junk from becoming too repetitive. The thing is, Overlord will be redundant no matter what crap they shove down our throats during the filler episodes. Isekai anime are so oversaturated that only making more of the same isn&#039;t enough these days. I&#039;ve seen so many of these isekai power fantasies—perhaps Overlord was more original when the light novel first began publication, but today it&#039;s trite, overdone, a waste of time. <br />
<br />
At least the few episodes Momonga gets are slightly more entertaining than the filler ones. He and the people around him have eye-catching character designs, wacky personalities, and enjoyably overdone voice acting. There&#039;s almost no substance to any of them, but at least they&#039;re fun to watch in small doses. The thing is, this new season is barely about the actually exciting characters. The only one in Momonga&#039;s legion who gets a backstory is his butler (the blandest of them all). He has an even intimidating personality but none of the charisma necessary to hold up entire episodes independently. There was a small amount of development seen for a few members of the enormous cast, but it&#039;s for the boring ones that no one is watching the show for. An occasional twist in a character&#039;s personality following a surprising betrayal may offer some fleeting intrigue, but you will quickly realize that all those twists exist. To momentarily add a fresh coat of paint to a cast of rotting cardboard cutouts.<br />
<br />
Momga&#039;s episodes were at least better than those about random bland side characters, especially during the last three episodes of this season. We see all-out violence using nonsensical magic to create exciting gorefests and lots of angry expressions. It&#039;s still never what I&#039;d call good, but it&#039;s passable entertainment. Momonga&#039;s storylines do tend to get repetitive quickly. An issue arises among his legion or in the world; he is literally the most powerful being in the universe and kills shit, then gives us a comment on it in his &#039;nice guy&#039; voice, rinse and repeat. The only reprieve from the mind-numbing formula is the final few episodes, full of gory action, plot twists, and even betrayals that actually had me surprised. Although I struggled to care about the turns the plot took or the characters who took radical changes, it provided a fresh perspective on the tired story, even if for a moment. Sadly, the action-packed moments weren&#039;t much better than what we&#039;ve seen before from Overlord, plagued with issues caused by a rushed production. <br />
<br />
The action scenes are lackluster at best. Madhouse is airing three anime just this season alone, so it would be unreasonable to expect flawless quality, but this is just flat out the same mediocre visuals as the first season. Action scenes rely on zoom in on still shots, unanimated motion tweens, and jarring CGI. Environments are dreadfully ugly to look at; dull colors, low res repeated textures, a lack of detail, and defining traits. It all feels so lifeless and flat. It&#039;s the kind of show I would have forgotten entirely if I wasn&#039;t reviewing it. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is equally mediocre, totally forgettable. The bog-standard sort of booming orchestral music fades into the background. The opening was ok; a generic rock song. The ending track &quot;Hydra&quot; was wonderfully wispy with haunting vocals. It was the best part of the show, the only reason why I was hesitant to drop it all season. <br />
<br />
Anything separating Overlord from the hordes of low effort isekai adaptations we see every season is only superficial; neither the audiovisual nor writing are above average. The main character being a &#039;villain&#039; is just a cheap facade, the setting is lifeless, and even the cool designs are diminished by lackluster visuals. <br />
Overlord is overrated. It&#039;s just more of the same boring isekai drivel.

    The greatest allure and strength of the Overlord narrative has always been Ainz’s delicate dance between the ordinary dime-a-dozen salary man of Earth and his Overlord status in this other world. His utterly devoted fanatical underlings treat him like that of a god who can do no wrong. He can’t afford to make mistakes because his servants cannot imagine him making one. To make one is to not be a god. And he intends to keep that image because anything else might disrupt the equilibrium of Nazarick and, more importantly, jeopardize his safety and base of operations. In the strange world he finds himself in,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276670">
        the most powerful known beings who can threaten his safety are those under him. On and on, his everyman impulses struggles with what he thinks a supreme ruler should act. He must pretend to be prescient when he knows next to nothing and carefully delegate his subordinates in a way that gets his wishes done without revealing that he knows less than them on how to carry it out.<br />
<br />
He’s a man trapped in a situation that already slipped out of his control, propelled by his ever-faithful minions’ tendency misconstrue his words as gospel, his musings as genius, and his luck as omniscience, as well as their fear that he would leave them as his guildmates already have. He’s all they have left of the great beings they worship, and by jove they will raze the world to the ground in his name if that’s what it takes to keep him by their side.<br />
<br />
Everything else about Overlord is just barely decent. The problem with the anime series is that it fails so hard to translate and convey the strongest core selling point of Overlord.<br />
<br />
What Overlord S2 is trying to sell now is the idea of a world bigger than its protagonist and that one fails too on two fronts: the core idea itself and the execution of that idea.<br />
<br />
Overlord, due to the nature of the LN, is a series that adds and adds, but rarely expands. You might wonder how can adding more and more detracts from a narrative. It does when you keep adding without expanding on what is already established. Overlord has multiple plot points and threads hanging in the air, the energy and time establishing them being wasted away. We’re not going to tackle the source materials here though because it is a review of the anime adaptation so let’s keep it to the anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
Suffice is it to say that the way Overlord is setup forces a quandary on the series. The first season does not easily expand into this second season and the first arc of this season does not expand into the second arc. You could say that they are merely individual build-ups sections – badly done build-ups at that, not because there is no immediate pay-off but because they feel like (and probably are) build-up to different things. It’s risking the fact that you may not get invested in the flow of the story because there is really no smooth flow of the story yet. Again, this isn’t a fault of the adaptation and it can very easily be rectified by solid execution. It starts off with a little bit of disadvantage but just really needs to present itself right and everything will fall into place.<br />
<br />
Does it?<br />
<br />
Season 2 is an adaptation of Volumes 4, 5, and 6 of the light novel. Volumes 5 and 6 are two continuous stories, a mega-arc if you will. Volume 4, however, connects to Volume 5 with only the barest, thinnest of threads. These are two very different arcs with vastly different locales, (massive) set of characters, and conflicts that need to be established all under 13 episodes. That’s simply not enough time for two different stories (with at least two different storylines running in parallel.) in two different types of settings. That is insane.<br />
<br />
The characters could have been the saving grace in the transition but here’s the thing: Overlord S2 sidelines the Season 1 characters with significant screentime to side character status. That’s not a bad thing. Heck, done well it could have been a good thing. The problem is that the new season starts with a new set of characters you don’t really care about and then the show botched its attempt at making you care about them and then uses them for only five episodes before they are then discarded to introduce yet another fresh batch of characters. The problem here isn’t even in you losing track of who they all are. The problem here is if you even care at all who they are. It’s a large mess that frankly is easier to follow than to care about.<br />
<br />
Madhouse forgot one simple Ron Swanson principle: never half-ass two things; whole-ass one thing. You can feel the oozing, overpowering, rank mediocrity as the studio rushes through the Lizardman Arc to get to the next arc. Rather than skip the first arc to focus on the next or give the first arc justice, they decide to do the first arc but do it in such a way that they get to the next arc faster, a decision that they didn’t even do justice come the next arc. This decision gives us a lot of hastened info dumps, uninspired character designs, insipid backdrops, and budget fight scenes.<br />
<br />
What few genuinely strong moments it could have had, it squanders for lack of pacing. A painful example of this is Zaryusu&#039;s rather interesting and compelling argument (on why they should fight) that lost every sense of impact possible due to the fact that it was said immediately with nary a proper establishment of the Lizardmen economy and culture or Zaryusu&#039;s place in all that. It was pulled out of the hat and we&#039;re supposed to just accept it because it was said so without planting the seeds of ideas first in the viewers (sadly this isn’t an isolated case or adaptation specific failure even). It didn&#039;t even need to go to great lengths for its setting. It just needs to establish the setting enough to ground the arc&#039;s main character in it. It failed. It simply did not have the luxury of time for the size of the story it attempted to tell.<br />
<br />
Imagine if it developed that. Imagine a tribal setting, a rarity in anime, with Lizardmen instead of humans as the main characters, which is even rarer. Imagine how much it could have had expanded on what little the LN established. Imagine the different tribal colors and patterns depending on the locale of a specific tribe: say solid, blocky lines for the mountainous, flowing curves for the lake-bound. Paint a picture in your mind’s eyes, a cacophony of colors and patterns anime never tackled before. Imagine the new-ness, the fresh-ness of it all. Can you see it? It’s only a simple scenario of how they could have gone with the series if they focused on one arc and did it justice. <br />
<br />
To be frank, Overlord S2 is boring. Not because it’s too slow but because it’s too fast. The entire season feels like it’s just a pure un-distilled fan-service for the LN readers. It’s a chance for them to see their favourite scenes and characters animated and acted out. If you’re an anime-only watcher, expect not to care about anything because this show is the equivalent of you in a tour through a safari/wildlife preserve and your tour vehicle is moving at 100km/h. There’s something out there, you just can’t savour it.<br />
<br />
In fact, the second season seemed like it was made just to keep the Overlord flame going. The studio realized they have a popular IP and they need to keep what little hype was left from the first season two+ years ago so that they can revisit the idea of another season down the road if they need to. And it shows. This is as cheap, as rushed, and as unimaginative as they can make it. Frankly you should ask yourself this: if Madhouse couldn’t be arsed enough to care, why should you?

    Overlord 2, written by Kugane Maruyama, Illustrated by So-bin.<br />
<br />
My Review About Overlord Season 2 (Winter 2018) (Sorry for my bad english :( )<br />
It contains some spoiler, Read with your own risk ^_^ .<br />
<br />
- Story 8/10 - :<br />
Overlord Season 2, comes with 13 Episode, Animated by Studio Madhouse.<br />
First Episode you can say it as Introduction about Overlord Season 2, Flashback about what is happening in Previous season, and preparation for the next Arc.<br />
<br />
Overlord Season 2, contain a &quot;World Building Arc&quot;, where the side characters spawn more than the Main Characters and explain what happening with this Side Characters and their Story (it&#039;s kinda like every human

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277268">
        have own Story of their life). If you still don&#039;t Understand about it, I recomended you to play RPG-Game first before watching this show.<br />
<br />
At the beginning (Episode 2) we will redirect to Lizardman Arc. Lizardman Arc is one of the &quot;World Building Arc&quot; which is the last goal of Ainz Ooal Gown(or you can say The writter) to make a Country where all of Demi-humans can live together with Happiness (Including Dwarf, Lizardman, Elf and others).<br />
<br />
Back to the Story, this Lizardman Arc, show about how Lizardman live together, suffering about food, sacrifice others Lizardman using a War in order to reduce an overpopulated Lizardman. Everything you see in this 4 Episode mainly about Lizardman&#039;s Tribe. (Episode 2-5)<br />
Zaryusu Shasa is the Main Protagonist for this Arc, it ll explained well how he re-united all of the Lizardman&#039;s Tribe after the last war, found his Lover Crush Lulu, preparing a war agains Nazarick, Killing Iguva (Ainz Undead), and later killed by Cocytus and got revived.<br />
<br />
The Story is good, its explained well from Viewpoint of Lizardman, nothing rushed in this Arc, it was same as Light Novel Story, I really love episode 3 where Zaryusu vs Iguva , and episode 4 where Ainz move like a Supreme being in front of Lizardmans. its kinda unique and interesting for me.<br />
<br />
Move to next story about Man In Kingdom 1 &amp; 2 Arc(Episode 6-13), about this Arc im agree with some people that it rushed since they already wasting few episode focusing on Lizardman. but im not really worried about it, basically the main plot are still there and still explained carefully so the audience will not confused about it. this Arc will explore more about the characters on Re-Estize Kingdom (Climb,Renner,Blue Rose etc), and continuation of &#039;Sebas Story&#039; (If you watch season 1 Sebas was sent by Ainz to Re-Estize Kingdom as a bait to find people who brainwashed Shalltear). <br />
About this arch i really love Last 3 Episode, especially when Entoma vs Blue Rose and Ainz vs Jaldabaoth. its make me want to watch more of this anime. (and luckly they announced the Season 3).<br />
<br />
For me the Story of Overlord season 2 is Very Good with this all of World Building.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Art : 8/10 -<br />
Animated by studio Madhouse, the Art is Great, the Colour, the Brightness the Graphic and the Blur Effect, Texture, and the some Side-effect mixed well, even in some scene the character face was changed a bit but it still acceptable since it doesnt change that much.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Sound : 7,5/10 -<br />
I Love the Opening and the ending Song, the sound effect, and the Bg Music also well-played<br />
<br />
- Character : 8/10 -<br />
The World Building Arch explained well how the character grown up and their specific characteristics. it explore well how Zaryusu come as a Brave Warrior, how he has a feeling with Crush Lulu, you can even see their Sex scene !!, Crush lulu that always support him until the end.<br />
the &#039;Yandere&#039; Princess Renner, Loyal Dog Climb, how the relation about Master-Servant was build among them. Sebas that have &quot;Touch-me settings&quot; inside him, Tsuareninya feeling througt Sebas, and also how Evileye fallen in love with Momon, Entoma&#039;s character was shown in this Season 2 as well, Sadistict Mare ,Brain Unglaus that face up his fear again Shalltear and a lot of it. it was Very Good and explained well in this Season.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment : 9/10 -<br />
Great !, im already Enjoyed this show since first Season, what makes me enjoy this show?. <br />
<br />
*This is a Dark show with a lot of Blood, Gore, where cut human&#039;s head is acceptable, its fit well for me. its also contains a Funny scenes, especially when Ainz-sama talking in his mind about what he need to do, or when the emotion taken away because he is Undead. its fun and refreshing.<br />
<br />
*The Master-Servant relationship between Ainz and his Guardians is also interesting, the Loyalty of the Guardian is so awesome, you can only find this relationship only when you watching Overlord (The Master-Servant relationship without any betrayal from both side). where they can accept each other, Hating anyone outside but Loves everyone inside &#039;Great Tomb of Nazarick&#039;, Believe that you can&#039;t betraying someone who gives you a life, the Truth about Loyalty, sometime it feels Heartwarming (If you watch last episode of Overlord Season 1).<br />
<br />
*There is less lovey-dovey scenes where the MC is surrounded with a lot of Girls who loving him, the only people loving Ainz is only Albedo !!!, yes Albedo !!, what about shalltear??? She is loving Ainz because of her fetish about Undead !!, so dont calculate her !!! :P , Evileye? ah She love Darkness &quot;Momon&quot; not our Supreme Lord Ainz-sama...(eventhough they are same xD)<br />
<br />
<br />
*Non-idealistict show, its not the show where the MC trying to save everyone he met (especially girl), even its impossible, its also not the show where someone can gain Over Power when they are pressed..., this show teach you how to become more Realistic, what you can save and what you need to sacrifice in order to save someone, the difference between the Strong and the weak,Profit and loss, it also teach you even you are OP(Overpowered) you still need a plan boyo!<br />
<br />
Thats the point why i enjoy this show, its a Great show for me.<br />
<br />
- Overall : 8,5/10 - <br />
Overlord Season 2, a sequel of Overlord Season 1, was a good show, there is a lot point if you watching it carefully,If you think Overlord is Anime with full Action Genre then you completely wrong. it also have political scene and Drama like Anime &quot;Maou No Yuusha&quot; but with more soft scenes that make people understand what&#039;s going on, this anime will not fit for someone who searching a lot of fight and battle scenes. and this series need a continuation to connect all of the side and main event, thats why i recommended you to watch it properly. <br />
Basically Overlord are different with some anime like SAO and Log Horizon. Overlord, Ainz and his NPC was Transported from Game World (YGGDRASIL game) to Another World (Isekai) called New World(NW), he cannot using the Game feature anymore right after transported to New World, he cannot logged out because of this, while SAO and Log Horizon still remain in their Game World(Trapped in Game World) and still able to using the Features of the game itself. Thats why they are searching the way to logged out from the Game. Some people are misunderstanding about this matter.<br />
<br />
My overall for this show is 8,5 and it is Great, worth and enjoyable to watch.<br />

    Sequels based on light novels aren’t too common but for a series like Overlord, it felt like it was inevitable. The meme of “Madhouse not making sequels” got flushed down the toilet when Overlord II became a reality. As someone who has read part of the novel and seen the first season, I’m sad to say that Overlord II didn’t manage to step up the plate. What could have been a chance for the series to improve itself and set new bar instead is met with a step back. If you’re expecting the second season to be a glorious showstopper, then I’m afraid I got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276669">
        bad news.<br />
<br />
I’ll say right off the bat that Overlord II pretty much screams “watch the first season!” In fact, I suggest checking out some of the more prominent episodes from the first season is necessary if you want to get a better experience. This show isn’t here to feed you with exposition anymore. The first season has done that already and viewers should expect a developing storyline with established characters. Or that seems to be the case at first. However, the first few episodes not only reintroduces previous characters but also introduces new ones. An important race known as the “Lizardmen” get their spotlight as we are introduced to their society. We learn about their culture, characteristics, military, economy, and motivations. To me, the Lizardmen possesses many human traits and emotions that aren’t too different compared to our own. Characters such as Zenburu Gugu, Green Claw Tribe Chieftain Shasryru and his brother Zaryusu displays their fierce personalities that makes them example of being capable leaders. Then, there are characters like the priestess Crusch Lulu who represents a more fragile and feminine side of the Lizardmen tribes. The point of the show seems to be trying to get viewers into accepting them and worth investing into. However, it didn’t do an adequate job as a good amount of these Lizardmen characters aren’t well developed. It’s a series that attempts characterization at non-human characters but ends up not accomplishing the job. It also doesn’t help that the story is incredibly predictable for their inevitable fates when facing off against powerful enemies.<br />
<br />
This only consist the first half of the show that adapts volume 4 from the light novel series. These first six episodes tries to get fans back into the mood but honestly, I felt like expectations were betrayed. As a curious person, I was hoping the remaining episodes would improve but oh boy, I was wrong.<br />
<br />
The remainder half of the show (roughly 7 episodes) covers the plot from the novel based on the “The Men in the Kingdom” (volumes 5-6). My initial expectations weren’t high as the first of these episodes had odd pacing and didn’t get me interested in characters except for Sebas. The other problem is that he is already a somewhat established character so it easy for viewers to accept him. Characters such as Climb, Brain, Tsuare, and Renner are much harder to accept. It falls into the pit of weak characterization again as they are hardly well developed outside of their personalities. We don’t learn much about their past and their motivations for fighting is hardly interesting. Renner is also a character that’s easy to point fingers at once viewers discover her true personality. The one character that does stand out a bit is Sebas during this arc as he shows a more valiant side of him after understanding Tsuare. Does that make him a breakout star? Not really. While Sebas is definitely a motivating factor to keep up with the arc, he is limited to a generic philosophy of helping a damsel in distress. I also find his role with Solution to be rather blend. The way Solutions suspects Sebas of being a betrayer to Ainz can easily make the audience dislike her. Still, I think the weakest part of this arc involves the antagonists, the Eight Fingers. Their key members are incredibly ill-written with dull motivations and stereotypical personalities. None of them are worthy enough to remember and I honestly wish they didn’t even exist. They didn’t manage to bring out the best out of anyone and in fact, I think they even puts a shame in the limited battle scenes. <br />
<br />
I’ve talked a lot about the minor and supporting characters of the show. What about the main characters? Sadly, there’s hardly any development for them. For the case of the floor guardians and battle maids, we only get to see a few of them showcase their abilities. If you’re a fan of Cocytus, Demiurge, Aura, or Entoma, then it might be a soft treat. Don’t expect much from them as their roles are limited. It feels like this second season tries to do too much to give them any sort of meaningful place honestly. Oh and how can I forget the infamous Ainz/Mmonga. It may sound strange for me to mention him this late in the review. Save the best for last right? Actually, Ainz is far from the best character in this series and I would actually label him as one of the worst. As the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, he feels a lot more like a background character this season. There’s virtually no development for Ainz and it’s a big slap to anyone who wants to understand more about him. We see him sit in the back like a God monitoring his servants and issuing orders. It’s incredibly stale to see Ainz in such a role. The first season at least established his personality in a way that was thrilling enough but this sequel dropped the ball. Sadly, his biggest fangirl Albedo isn’t any better this season besides glorifying her own fetishes. <br />
<br />
Madhouse returns and while I can’t say I’m impressed by the overall quality, it does make a nice attempt at designing the Lizardmen. They look faithful to the light novels and expresses human characteristics that I occasionally find enticing to watch. Violence is also exploited to bring out the dark fantasy elements of its story. However, there are two main drawbacks that I find unappealing for this season. First, it’s the action scenes as some of them are very limited and lazily animated. Second, it’s the world setting. It feels like once you’ve seen it once, you’ve seen them all. Hardly original and uninspiring. <br />
<br />
The first season’s OP song was quite a thrill to the ears. This season took a step back and I find it skippable at times. Similarly, most of the human characters’ dialogues consists of weak words choices that I can’t really find worth quoting. On a more positive note, I did like the way the season used its battle OST. While some of those fights did feel short, the soundtrack did make up for a bit of the impact to highlight their intensity. Some of the emotional segments of the sequel (in particular Sebas and Tsuare) also felt real with the melancholic usage of the music.<br />
<br />
Ah, Overlord II. It’s a sequel that shouldn’t have been resurrected if this is what the creative team had planned. Adapting those light novels into a 1-cour show felt like a risky plan and they didn’t manage to capitalize. It’s a series that’s exciting to watch as a linear continuity but if you’re interested in a well-developed story and characters, then look elsewhere. Too bad really. The show boasts a talented cast that kicked off with some wild entertainment before spiraling into disappointment with no looking back.

    If you don&#039;t like fantasy or magic or like a human being stuck in a game/world... this anime is not for you. <br />
<br />
Overlord - an anime that is able to portray a wonderful story through <br />
interactions of other characters in a unknown world despite the fact that the MC is not &quot;human&quot;.<br />
<br />
After watching Overlord I, many people were awaiting for the sequel... <br />
<br />
and the wait is over. <br />
<br />
And I gotta say, the plot of this anime and how it&#039;s portrayed is superb. <br />
<br />
Everything I say in this anime is assuming that you have watched the first season of Overlord. I highly suggest you watch the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270146">
        first season, or you wouldn&#039;t be able to enjoy the full experience season two will be giving you. (and you won&#039;t understand a thing... so yeah !)<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really understand some beef people are giving the anime arc. Like sure the first four episodes so far has been about an  arc that isn&#039;t really focused on the MC in the light novel. But there&#039;s obviously a reason for this The reason for these episodes is literally an introduction of the plot and is super hyped later.  Trust me. The suspense in the light novel, if portrayed in this anime, will be no joke. It will be one word: amazing. <br />
<br />
The art is really nice and is better than your average anime.<br />
<br />
The beginning OST fits well with the theme of the anime. The ending... not so much but it&#039;s still pretty good. <br />
<br />
Characters are really well developed in this season. Even characters that are supposed to be side stories, the anime provides us the chance to understand these characters and their actions, attaching the audience to these characters and their emotions.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really enjoying this anime. You will too. <br />
<br />
Overall the only thing that this anime is not perfect in other eyes is because the first episodes are about an irrelevant arc in the light novel. But trust me, as soon as this arc gets rolling the anime will become super fun to watch. Like Naruto(if you watched it), there were many parts that were &quot;boring&quot;. But those boring scenes help hype up the whole season and were the main reason that the anime could grow in development. <br />
<br />
I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU WATCH THIS ANIME. <br />
<br />

    Review written at episode 4.  I have not read the light novel.  Will update nearer the end of the season.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: So far, worthless.<br />
<br />
Whether it be because the manga went through a slump, or whether Madhouse simply didn&#039;t try with this arc, the end result is terrible.  The character designs are uninspiring, the plot is boring, and the character interactions felt as though they&#039;d been lifted from a template.  Compared to the first season, which I loved every moment of, this is abysmal.<br />
<br />
Is there anything that Madhouse did right?<br />
<br />
Yes.  The moments where it paid attention to Shalltear&#039;s inner turmoil about what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270674">
        happened at the end of last season, and the thought cocyutus put into his answers when interrogated by Ains were well done.  They may have been a tad obvious (shallow), but still appropriate and well executed.  However, these moments don&#039;t even account for a whole episode&#039;s worth of screen time.<br />
<br />
Also, with the exception of the lizardmen, the characters are well-designed (and drawn) and the soundtrack is pretty good.<br />
<br />
So what could Madhouse have done better?<br />
<br />
- If they really had no choice but to include all of this, they could have reformatted it into flashbacks.  The biggest problem with this garbage is that it&#039;s four episodes of continuous garbage.  If it were broken down into chunks, as could be done with a flashback, then it would be more tolerable.  As it is, it&#039;s just going to turn people away before it gets good.<br />
<br />
- Preferrably, though, don&#039;t include this rubbish in the first place.  There is a rather large amount of &quot;character development&quot; that serves no benefit to the story.  If said character development was done well, then this wouldn&#039;t be a problem, but it&#039;s heavy-handedness and outright sillyness simply makes the characters seem superficial.  Had Madhouse decided to distribute this arc through flashbacks, this would be the perfect excuse to remove all the lazy character development.  By starting off with &quot;these two are in a relationship&quot; then later clarifying on the important points of &quot;how it happened&quot;, the majority of the uninteresting content could be cut, giving more time for the development of the interesting characters.<br />
<br />
* let me be clear, I am not a particular fan of flashbacks, I just support their appropriate use to remove periods of boredom or inactivity.<br />
<br />
- Alternatively, they could have simply put more effort into the first four episodes.  While some are hardcore fans of remaining true to the source, if the source contains a clearly sub-par section, minor, targeted revisions can be beneficial.  If this was merely a matter of madhouse not caring about these episodes and simply rushing them, then they&#039;ve dug their own grave.<br />

    I would like to start with my first time, when I started watching first season (that was my first mmorpg anime show before sao and other similar shows) and after the first series I right away put in Overall 11/11 masterpiece, I know ppl want to now why? and srsly why masterpiece??? the answer is simple- My first mmorpg game was World of warcraft and all fandom wow players (and other mmorpg) players know, that feel when you reach max game level+ almost best gear and with that you can start boast the low level players and show yours overpowered spells/skills. As example now- I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272735">

    Overlord is a Japanese light novel series that was written by Kugane Maruyama and illustrated by so-bin. It began serialization online in 2010, before being acquired by Enterbrain. Twelve volumes have been published since July 30, 2012. A manga adaptation by Satoshi Oushio, with art by Hugin Miyama, began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten&#039;s manga magazine Comp Ace from November 26, 2014. A 13-episode anime television series adaptation by Madhouse aired between July 7 and September 29, 2015. The second season ran from January 9 to April 3, 2018. A third season is planned for July 2018.<br />
<br />
Overlord is back. Now with 100% more lizard porn, a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277007">
        group of adamantine class adventurers, a band of highly-class bloodthirsty thieves controlling many people, and a yandere princess. For those who already know what Overlord is about, I must say that the new season has not changed at all. It again takes the series some episodes to start the whole thing: you will be shown, let us say, a filler that is not that entertaining to watch. More than that, it is so bad that it might make you want to drop the second season. Fear not, if you do hate the filler, just skip it. All the fun starts afterward.<br />
<br />
Overlord did become much better because of its story-line and characters. Ainz Ooal Gown yet again continues his quest on becoming top class adamantine adventurer to collect enough information for Nazarick. Many things are still unexplained, but the second season also answers many questions that have not been answered in the first season. Character wise, many new characters have been introduced starting from the Nazarck servants and ending with many anti-heroes that have their interesting backgrounds for you to find out about. But this is, of course, not the best part about characters. What you will surely appreciate is the fact that many Nazarick’s servants receive a ton of development. Indeed, I am not going to go into details, but I will say only one thing--you will love it. <br />
<br />
All in all, Overlord is still one of the most epic series about MMORPG games. The second season offers you a more detailed look at Nazarick’s servants and the enemies Ainz will have to face. I would highly recommend you start watching the anime right from the 6th episode; otherwise your opinion on Overlord might change because of it.

    I&#039;ve not read the manga so i had no idea really what to expect from this show for the second season, and well it definitely surprised me<br />
<br />
Now although the first season was better, I believe this season has done its purpose really well in terms of building the world and characters, and has got me really pumped for another season!<br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
<br />
<br />
You can&#039;t say they haven&#039;t tried do something interesting and change it from the normal<br />
It&#039;s not often I can say I watched an anime where the main character barely graces us with his presence yet i still thoroughly enjoyed the show<br />
<br />
In the first season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276932">
        we were somewhat thrown into this world along with Ainz<br />
Season 2 throws us a bit of a curveball and really focus on many of the side characters a.k.a Ainz minions/companions<br />
<br />
One thing i really liked about this was that it allowed us to grasp the power levels of Ainz and his servants much better in comparison to the world around them<br />
As the weaker of Ainz servants fights the stronger humans you start to see general power differences between everyone. (Long story short our boy Ainz just keeps on looking more and more OP)<br />
<br />
Art - 9 <br />
<br />
Not much to say other than pretty beautiful, nice little mix of sword/mage fighting and all looked really sleek and cool<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
<br />
The music pretty much the same as season 1<br />
Everything fits the mood, but other than the song started during the credits of the penultimate episode none of them left an imprint on my mind, so nothing special<br />
<br />
Character - 10 <br />
<br />
Now I love all this ridiculous character building they have done on just random individuals or groups around the world<br />
<br />
They have a little warriors spirit saga with Cocytus and an odd little maid master gangs conundrum with Sebas, both polar opposite sort of feel but both really endeared me to these characters (specially Sebas)<br />
<br />
A lot of focus was also put on the humans Ainz had met and their companions, and they added a nice extra level of nerves to the show, as for a change you were routing for someone who wasn&#039;t all powerful, and actually might lose<br />
<br />
Also I do have to do a little shout out, I wont name any names to prevent spoilers but I love that there seems to be the making of a Yuno Gasai 2.0 in the overlord world now (I&#039;m a sucker for a Yandere)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
<br />
I love this show, and yes it&#039;s got a slight dark undertone to the anime but I think it&#039;s important when watching it not to take it too seriously<br />
I don&#039;t believe this anime was made with the intention to be incredibly gritty and dark with a highly intelligent story<br />
No, but it is exciting, sometimes shocking, and I am always on the edge of my seat just waiting for that next ridiculous thing to happen<br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
<br />
Overall I think they done a good job, although the story could be seen as a little slow i feel like the extra scenes had their purpose and helped to build the world<br />
I really hope, now that they have laid the groundwork they can press on and make season 3 something special<br />
<br />
<br />

    Ok, so most of the reviews here are based on only 4 episode out of the 11 episodes available, so that is why a lot of people are giving such bad reviews, which i think is not fair for this Awesome Anime.<br />
<br />
Story: Just as the first Overlord, the story is all about Momon-san, our protaginist, trying to conquer the new universe and trying to find Ydragsil players, if any, on the new universe. As you watch this Anime you would be asking: Why cant he wiped out everyone and that&#039;s it? since our protagonist and their crew are like the strongest beings in there? However

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274414">
        if you watched carefully our Protagonist, even though is an undead is still a human being and as a Rational thinking person He is REALLY CAREFUL about doing something, Plus of the threat of someone having mind control which makes him more cautelous about acting reckless, Thus the slow progression of the story.<br />
<br />
Art: The art style is vey common yet Awesome the world feels lively and characters are well designed. I dont like the 3d-like effect they made with some fighting and specially in battle with skull soldiers, but that is just my opinion. <br />
<br />
Sound: Everything is amazing here the Opening, Ending, the soundtracks they use in the story blends really well making it more exciting,sad,funny, depending on the situation. <br />
<br />
Characters: I love some characters in here, However since there is so much characters some are left out and some takes all the screen times, Albedo takes really small screen time which you may forget about her, the first half of the anime you will only see Lizards man which is compresible why people did not like Overlord 2 since they are not our protaganist and still taking so much screen time. Still it was a nice Arc in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I CAN NOT STOP WATCHING THIS! there is something about Overlord that keeps you hooked. Just watching our strong protagonist force killing those bastard feels so satisfying. Just watching how omnipotent are they compared to the humans that feels so proudly, watching them giving justice to those bad guys is so enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall: Just give a little bit of patience and you will love it, The first 6 episodes are not really appealing because is about Lizard man which are ugly being and not to mention the IMPREGNATE ME part which was disgusting hahah. BUT after that it is so Fun to watch this, there is a lot of action, a lot of justice and understandable action from our protagonist, the music enhace the overall experience, Just wait until you see EP. 11 the masterpiece of the season, felt like a episodes written from Games of Thrones. So do not let some reviews fool you, you are missing out one of the best Anime this year!

    Start slow and boring, but gradually getting more interesting towards the end. As a fans of 1st season of overlord, that&#039;s my impression after watching this. <br />
<br />
Without spoil anything, overlord II consists of 2 arcs (just like the prequel). and I will tell you that first arc are slow and not so good, either story or action-wise. But it&#039;s building and contributing something to the plot, and one of them I&#039;ve seen it already at 2nd arc. And maybe there are more to come in the next season (I really hope there will be 3rd season). But still, it would be better if they shorten

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276922">
        the 1st arc in just maybe 2-3 episodes, instead of 5. And I will tell you why next.<br />
<br />
Next let&#039;s talk about more interesting stuffs, the next arc offers a lot of good and promising developments. The story is quite interesting, and there are a lot of funny new characters too. Some are related to events in the 1st season, too bad the dangerous enemies (or should we called nation or organization) that gave Ains quite trouble before not properly updated here. but they still appear few times, that&#039;s pretty good too though it only increasing my curiosity. Aside from that, the 2nd arc provide more insight to Ains subordinates, like sebaz, cocytus, demiurge and that&#039;s nice to see. <br />
<br />
I would like to give more score if not for the short of episodes. There are a lot of things that I think it should be explained better and/or need longer introduction. The new characters sometimes just appeared randomly in the middle of events, and later we found that they&#039;re actually important characters. Some events switch randomly too because too much happening in the same time frame. That&#039;s even worse if you expects Ains get more screen times like I do, because he rarely appear throughout entire episodes, well.. he appeared a lot in the end though. What I want to say is, there should be more episodes, maybe they should make overlord 2 into 24-25 episodes. If not, they should just shorten the 1st arc.<br />
<br />
The verdict is, overlord 2 still good to go, it&#039;s not better than the prequel though. Well, just endure the first few episodes if you just starting and bored. Overall overlord is good series, including season 1 this series can easily become my top isekai, game like, fantasy story. The concepts evil undead as protagonists is quite unique if I should say. Though Log Horizon still ranked above this, but I think it&#039;s plain rude to compare this to simple and brainless kid show like SAO. Please refrain to watch this if you just expect a lot of mindless actions and sappy love story. And I strongly recommend Overlord for those who like great fantasy anime inspired by game and have deep and interesting story and memorable characters.

    The best anime this season. Not really a fan of the character&#039;s art but I have to admit, this series really gets you to care about all the characters. I love the storytelling and yes, not everything is about the mighty lord. I have nothing else to say about this anime, it&#039;s just good. Without spoiling anything, the second season actually focuses on side characters, to show their individual storylines. Though the mighty lord may have little influence on these characters, the show shows their personal experiences and what everyone is thinking about. This game is not just a game, it&#039;s really strategic and even

    a simple review about Overlord Season 2.<br />
<br />
  Overlord Season 2 come into 3 Arch, Each arch have a different story &amp; characters, not only focusing on Ainz-sama or his Guardian Floor. If you said that all of them are unneeded character then its a big mistakes. Later all of this arch will be connected each other(if you read the LN or if they make it into another season), and ofc there is no harem or something like that in this second season. <br />
  Maybe Overlord is the only Isekai with a Anti-Hero/villain protagonist. and if you are a gamer you will know the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276822">
        feeling when the Main Character is the kind of Last Boss from the game itself.<br />
 Comparing Overlord with SAO or LogHorizon just because they have same genre &quot;Trapped in Game World&quot; is ridiculous, same genre doesnt means have a same plot, Momonga was trapped alone in a New World together with his NPC (Master - Servant relationship). he was trapped as a lv 100 player, thats why he become OP <br />
About the writing skill?? oh come on Overlord Light novel won a Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi in 2017, Overlord Light Novel was the best selling light novel series of 2015. so no need to doubt it. the Anime BD sales was success with 12.000 copy for only 1 volume on 2015. what i can say is, let the result speak.<br />
Also did you guys noticed that almost all popular anime got bad hatred review on the top, while overrated anime got a lot of good reviews? xD, yup popular show have hatred reviews means they are popular enought to get attention from those guys, how can? as you can see they make a bad and loooong review, they can wrote the details itself from the anime, isnt it make a sense they are caring about the show? they even watching it until last episode, ehhhh, if the show is bad i ll not watching it until the end and will dropped it as soon as possible....... xDDD<br />
If it&#039;s your first time reading reviews on MAL , here i will give you an advice :<br />
<br />
-Overrated Anime : a lot of good review with good score like 8,9,10, and all of them are in top reviews, you will see a less people giving score under 5,<br />
<br />
<br />
- Popular Anime : there is a top review with a score like 1,2,3,4, and with bad and looooonnnnngggg review just to get the attention <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you :)<br />

    I can&#039;t say enough amazing things about this anime! I&#039;m constantly at the edge of my seat watching this show and love how each episode develops into a truly masterpiece of a world. The stuck in the game plot gets so much better with this smart and heart throbbing action packed anime. Every character in this show has something to give and they all shine in their own unique ways. <br />
<br />
I definitely recommend this anime for anyone who enjoys the OP Stuck in the game theme. Also if you enjoyed the show I highly recommend the Light Novel series as well!~<br />
<br />

    There are some minor spoilers within from Overlord (season 1 and 2). It&#039;s nigh impossible to talk about it without giving away spoilers...<br />
Be warned please...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another review of another anime but this time about Overlord - one of my favourite series of 2015. With was my sixth anime since my return to anime world I really enjoy it. <br />
<br />
It was what I wanted. A series that connected to me since I read a lot of Warhammer &amp; 40K. I wanted to watch some anime that focus on an evil character and this was it. <br />
<br />
I love it so much that I even bought the Light Novel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276689">
        and I was really surprised that the first season comprised of the first and second light novels and they made it so good.<br />
<br />
The first season focus on Lord Ainz Ooal Gown or Momon who was trapped inside a game BUT DON&#039;T WORRY - this is not SAO. This is more adult, more dark more epic if you like.<br />
<br />
After finish the first season I quickly try other animes out there (focus on this premise of trapped within a video game or even Isekai but this one is probably my favourite (closely followed by Konosuba)).<br />
<br />
When I learn that a second season was coming I was excited and true to be told is not as good as the first season. Why, you ask. Well, the first season focus a lot on our main character and the tower they live giving some background on the NPC that live and serve the tower of Nazarick (This in the first 6 episodes).  The next 6 episodes focus a lot on Momon with the help of Narberal as he explores the nearby city and trying to understand how things work (and how different they are from the game).<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the second season, the first six episodes follows a LOT of lizardman (some random guys who live nearby the tower) and what the plans are for them. Here we have a lot of interaction on Cocytus (Guardian of 5th floor) and somewhat in Demiurge (Guardian of 7th floor). The second part of the series focus again on Sebas (a buttler of Nazarick) and other non-related characters of Nazarick like Climb (nice name); evileye (last three episodes), Lakyus, Lord Stronoff, Gagaran, Tia, Brain<br />
<br />
My main question is this... WHERE IS ALBEDO???? :) Yeah... there is almost no Albedo. Combining she has what? 5 lines throughout the season?<br />
<br />
The second half of the anime we learn that there is power people (well, to Nazarick standards they are like helpless ants) that rule E-Rantel and Momon wants to be a hero and so he with the help of Demiurge and the other Nazarick captains and Pleiades make that happen with some ruse that made some of the most awesome battles I&#039;ve seen in anime.<br />
<br />
I know some people dislike the trope (I do as well) of over-powerful characters like in SAO or Smartphone or Death March BUT here it works because even if he is over-powerful it&#039;s not the even the focus on the anime (I mean battles and such). This anime focus a lot on politics and it&#039;s what I call High Fantasy (or Epic) like Game of Thrones (minus the sex). It&#039;s all about the characters (all of them) and not only Momon. True be told in the second season he appears only in the last two or three episodes. Even Sebas or Demiurge are ovepowerful but the way the artists and writer wrote made them interesting, even if before the battle you already know he or she is going to win. That&#039;s why this anime works. The writing skill of the creator. That&#039;s why SAO sucks. Because the writer makes all about the main character and made it all too easy - the other characters exist only to give more focus on our main. In Overlord that doesn&#039;t happen at all. <br />
<br />
That ending left me wanting for more...WHAT A FIGHT between Momonga &amp; Demiurge (they are still master and peer but - a ruse) Who the heck is that Princess Renner... She looks kawaii and scary as shit!<br />
<br />
Overall, if you want a dark epic anime, this is it. If you want an evil main character this is it. There are some hints in his monologue in the last episode that hints to that (well throughout the series he always did what we would considered evil BUT in this context it&#039;s acceptable... only by watching you would understand...) There is blood and fighting that last 10m per episode. There is comedy as well. Every NPC (Nazarick captains and Pleiades) are different. I really enjoy this show and I hope it doesn&#039;t take two years two have a third season.<br />
<br />
So, why 8 instead of 9 or 10? Well first of all - NO ALBEDO! eheh and  because some episodes, even if they gave a bit of wide information about the world, it was very sparse and the story really didn&#039;t jump forward that much. I think the first 6 episodes were sub-par and in moments I thought this was another anime because the main characters are the lizards. I know the purpose was to give us more info on other races/places but they over do it. The last 6 episodes with Sebas and Demiurge were way better and I would have given a 10 without any question asked... so 6 and 10 divided it&#039;s equal 8 eheh

    Overlord II is indeed a show full of lizards -at least for the first half of the season, which I have seen so far; and I have to admit, I became to some extent aroused when I saw the lizard reproduction activities (this season really has such a scene).<br />
Overlord never was an anime that really used well and often the theme of &quot;the man trapped inside a virtual reality game.&quot; No, it feels more like an anime of an overpowered man who knows all about the world - because he comes from outside it - and wields power over everything as long as he is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271413">
        the only one with knowledge of the world and all its legendary items and such. <br />
The second season is a continuation of his quest to reassure himself that he is the only most powerful being in the world. He wondered in season 1 whether there was another like himself in the new reality, and to counteract against such possibilities, he conquers land and takes up missions to make himself rest assured. This season seems to show just a small portion of his overall longer quest than what one season can afford to show - that&#039;s the impression I get; a person who read the light novels might know better.<br />
But rest assured, it is actually quite interesting to see the lizards cower in fear (sort of) before the almighty Ainz Ooal Gown. To see the lizards be so overpowered by just one of Momonga&#039;s servants is very satsifying and entertaining.<br />
I didn&#039;t like the art. The depiction of a particular icy sword was horrible and childish, and the drawing quality was low tier.<br />
The OSTs and OPs and performance of the voice actresses are part of the Sound category. Nothing too remarkable or horrible in there. EDs and OPs sound fine. OST I don&#039;t remember. VAs do their job.<br />

    I am not exactly sure what happened but I enjoyed every single minute of it.<br />
It was fun, quite slow paced but overall very enjoyable. The whole story can be divided into two parts (little bit of SAO feeling there), the lizardmen part and the princess part. They are not really related, I don&#039;t think they even mention the lizards after they are done with them. Or maybe they don&#039;t want to talk about them because of the thing they had to witness in the tent?<br />
The characters are awesome and there is nothing else to say about them. I was basically fangirling (yes, that is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277020">
        word) over Sebas and his style. The way he dealt with the bad guys was pure awesomeness.<br />
The story was well written but a little bit short.<br />
I am really hyped about the next season.

    After Overlord&#039;s first season, full of badass characters and shows of power by Ainz, second season had a pretty rough start. Focus shifted from Nazarick to side characters, with Ainz and co. taking a back seat. Without a doubt, such change will disappoint people who watched this anime because of OP main cast.<br />
Still, it doesn&#039;t mean second season itself is bad. It&#039;s just different. Story moves from introducing Nazarick faction (first season) to outside world. Now we see lives of humans (and lizards) of Yggdrasil and Nazarick&#039;s actions from their perspective. And it rather is nice thing to see, especially when they actually show their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276688">
        power.<br />
I&#039;ll agree with many opinions that first arc was weak. It was far too long for what happened during it. And while 2nd arc is much more reasonable, the last few episodes more than make up for everything bad in previous 2/3 of anime.<br />
<br />
New characters introduced in 2nd season are an interesting bunch. Yeah, lizards are forgettable, I won&#039;t talk about them. But whole Blue Rose, especially Evileye and Lakyus, Unglaus and of course Renner, are really good characters that don&#039;t make you just wait for Ainz&#039;s appearance.<br />
This season also brought considerable development for Nazarick NPC&#039;s and shown their loyalty to Ainz.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never watched this anime for its art or music, but I have to admit those were good. If you skip openings then don&#039;t. This one is solid.<br />
While fight scenes aren&#039;t that special, they are pretty enjoyable. Animation is good and moves make sense. I&#039;d even say there were some above average fights in this season.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, if you liked first season, you won&#039;t regret watching second one. You might not like it at first, or even be disappointed after finishing, but it&#039;s still a good anime. Don&#039;t get discouraged by slow start.

    This is my first review ever on MyAnimeList.<br />
<br />
I am going to keep this review brief and cover the key points of Overlord II.<br />
<br />
Overlord II is almost the opposite of what the original was all about, instead of being very action based and based on Lord Ainz, Overlord II takes a different approach with more world building, development and different perspectives in an Isekai.<br />
<br />
The animation, although good doesn&#039;t really stand out in any way with the art style being the same as the original and the OST and OP being slightly worse in Overlord II than in the original.<br />
<br />
If you prefer action-packed and fast paced anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274072">
        similar to the first season, you won&#039;t enjoy this season as it has a much slower pace and focuses heavily on story-telling despite still retaining some quality action scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall Overlord II is a good anime but it isn&#039;t going to be enjoyable for everyone due to its much slower pacing but it is still enjoyable.<br />
<br />
If you like slow paced, developed story telling Overlord II is an 8/10<br />
<br />
If you like fast paced, acion-packed anime Overlord II is a 5/10<br />
