    Behold Fire Eater 2.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell<br />
The world we know is no more. A mysterious phenomenon stripped the humanity of the right to have a quiet life, with hopes and dreams. This plague is known as Spontaneous Human Combustion, which turns people randomly into mindless creatures known as Infernals. And that is the fate worse than death that causes one sufferings unimaginable. However, there are people that can control this cursed power and become pyrokinetics. To solve the mystery and cure the humanity, the Fire Defense Agency, Tokyo Army and The Holy Sol Temple form The Special Fire Force, also nicknamed Blue Stripes. Will the Special

        Fire Force solve the mystery and save the humanity from its new curse?<br />
<br />
Story<br />
I used to have high hopes for Fire Force. Especially since Soul Eater, they share the same original creator with Fire Force, had such a bad ending. Anyways, story wise, the anime has a very unique storyline that many anime will surely be jealous of. However, one thing ruins it all and that is the fact that the anime does not know what it wants to be. There are so many things happening, but hardly any solid explanation is given about any of them. This is one of these examples, when an anime is trying to be everything, but fails miserably. There is a religion, which is quite an important part of the world of Fire Force, yet the viewer does not know that much about it and the anime protagonists hardly ever question the religion. The new season introduces new characters, when there is still a bunch of characters that need to get some screen time for the viewer to understand them better. But the main problem of the new season is that it focuses more on action scenes that on anything else. Firefighters fight against the villains, people die and instead of them trying to finish this fight as soon as possible, they continue their fights with some pointless dialogues and after these fights no one even mentions the fact that so many people have died.<br />
<br />
Nothing changed. I would even say that there is even less story development in season 2 than in season 1. So many questions are unanswered and they are impossible to guess. A pity, since the first season did have more than enough material to work with to make Fire Force a masterpiece. However, it is just another Soul Eater that received ‘one of the greatest endings ever.’ It is just that there are far too many anime in this genre and with every year it becomes more of a problem for mangaka to come up with something that fans will regard as unique. Regrettably, there is nothing for me to prove that Fire Force is unique story wise, so hands off of it. No, this is not the case. The anime has far too many flaws, story wise.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The graphic component of Enen no Shouboutai is perhaps the main advantage of this series. The art here looks very stylish - from characters design and to their clothes, as well as the movement animation in all kinds of battles; the animation surely is an eye candy. The characters turned out to be truly memorable; attention has even been paid to various small details like teeth and elements of clothing and eyes. But the most important thing here is that action scenes look simply mind-blowing. <br />
<br />
Music<br />
The composer for the OST is Kenichiro Suehiro, who previously managed to make a worthy soundtrack for Re: Zero. In my opinion, he made this series even more epic than it is. Can you imagine a shounen with amazing action scenes, but with an average OST? Unthinkable! The soundtrack turned out to be diverse and elaborate - it has many of both lyrical and dynamic pieces. What is more, all opening scenes, as well as the endings are so epic, so you never want to skip them. The openings tend to be more aggressive, building up the adrenaline for the viewer, the endings, however, are more calming and give you a minute to reconsider what is happening and just to breathe, because some scenes are just so cool that you will have no time for that. Voice acting is on the level, as always; the voice actors did one hell of a job, trying to make Fire Force less average. <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Enen no Shouboutai has many characters and they are all very interesting to follow; they are also very different from each other, but at the same time, they complement each other, which makes the characters of this anime very intriguing. I will not try to hide the fact that many of them have cliché personalities of ‘insert a battle shounen here.’ It is not that much of a problem that many of the characters have cliché personalities; a genius can make a masterpiece out of a cliché storyline, as well as characters. The problem is that the viewer hardly gets to find out more about them and to understand the reasoning behind their actions. The whole new season feels as if it is some ‘throw a random character, make him fight Asta than show some nudes of a cat girl that is now a nun and then throw in even more characters, so that no one ever remembers that there are still characters that should tell their story. It just feels so chaotic, incoherent and disappointing. <br />
<br />
The main problem of the series remains the same. With a weak story like this, the only way to save the whole series would be interesting characters. However, this is hardly the case. It feels like the only character in the whole anime is Shinra. Even Arthur, who is supposed to be the one to make Shinra follow the path to save people and to make sure that what Shinra does is needed. I do not know, he could have just kept calling him the devil and taunting him that he would slay him, if there was something, he did not like about Shinra’s actions. Anything! But the characters are just beyond boring, they are just a bunch of NPC-like characters that wait for Shinra to do anything. A huge disappointment. <br />
<br />
Score<br />
3 nekomata out of 10 nekomata.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
All in all, I regret watching the second season. After seeing the first season I was ready to overhype it and to prove each and every user that Fire Force did have the potential to become a masterpiece. However, the second season failed to live up to its potential and became something that more focused on the battle scenes that lack some deep meaning that would add a grain of mystery and unknown for Fire Force. With that being said, if you are fan of battle-shounen series that do more fighting, but less thinking, Fire Force is what you are looking for. However, if you think that Fire Force, as a battle shounen, has something unique for you to change your opinion on the genre, I am sorry to say that, but there is nothing unique about it. To each his own.

    It’s been my view for a long time now that Fire Force is the best new gen shonen. Even without D. Pro’s amazing work on the anime, the story, characters, mystery and world are all very rich and well done.<br />
<br />
The second season builds on an already outstanding first season and turns everything up a notch. As we’ve come to expect from David Production, the animation, fights, sound production and OST are amazing. Every fight is not only choreographed well, but also features eargasmic sound production. Pacing is just great as well.<br />
<br />
Story wise, this season is really where Fire Force gets going in terms of unravelling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367494">
        the mystery of human combustion, the white clads and the Evangelist. Many of the questions you may have had after watching season 1 will be explained in this season. Side characters like Maki and Tamaki get sorely needed development arcs as well as introducing new faces.<br />
<br />
Overall, Fire Force S2 takes an already impressive anime to the next level, giving characters much needed layers of development, answering important lore questions, fleshing out a rich world and incredible action sequences. <br />
<br />
Season 2 of FF gets 10 Adolla Links, out of 10.

    If the mangaka and the director of Fire Force at David Production had one major flaw that they could have learned from the first season of Fire Force is the pacing. The pacing of Fire Force anime was so dreadful to the point that I fell asleep or was distracted for the majority of season one. Because of that, I had to rewatch numerous episodes that I missed. And We’re six episodes into the second season, this aspect of the anime has not even been considered to be modified.   <br />
<br />
To elaborate, this season has so far displayed nothing but fights. These fights look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351590">
        stunning, but I can’t appreciate it because it’s nothing but spectacles. There’re no emotions. No one in these fights feels any sense of danger. An Evangelist was thrown through numerous concrete walls and stood back up like it was nothing. Shinra was blasted and engulfed with a huge fire but he came out not having any burns when previously we have seen people been burned alive. On top of that, between each fight, there’re expositions about flashbacks, techniques, inner dialogues, and so on. All of this nonsense consumes the majority of each episode. By the end of it, you got nothing but stale talking and some flashy scenes that bear no weight and serves no purpose to the plot. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the plot, all we know so far is that the Fire Force company and the Evangelists want to capture a girl named Inca. She’s the fifth generation fire pillar that has the ability of Adolla Burst that can be used to discover a link to another realm. Which could then lead to the clues of a phenomenon that occurred before season one. And of course, the Evangelists are after her because they want to initiate a precedented event called the “Great Cataclysm” to bring chaos. You know, the generic villain group motivations. <br />
<br />
The Evangelists’ great idea of capturing their prey is to make noises. Not a small one, but an enormous one that grabbed the attention of Fire Force company #8. Since the Fire Force already knew where Inca was in the city of Tokyo, the anime and the writer could have easily turned the current dull fights into a hyper chase pursuit. Which could have elevated the enjoyment of this anime significantly. <br />
<br />
There’s not much depth to any of the characters in Fire Force since the first season was wasted on dragged out plot points and fights. Given by this season’s directions, I don’t expect much from them besides their usual quirks. To summarize, Shinra is the conventional shonen protagonist that has the typical motivation of a shonen protagonist. Besides his desire to be a “hero” and save his little brother and has some creep personality, he’s pretty much one dimensional. It’s also revealed that his power is linked to another source and there resides a demon/devil. Which he could use to enhance his abilities. Sounds familiar? (This is pretty the only thing that I’m interested in about his character, btw.) <br />
<br />
Arthur, he’s probably the only character that could grow on me and become interesting since the reveal of his back story. But we’ll see. As for females, they have their unique traits and can do things as the members of the fire force. Except for Iris and Tamaki. Iris just stands around and prays, and for the majority of the time, Tamaki is used for unnecessary fanservice and cliche jokes. <br />
<br />
The biggest appeal of this show is without a doubt the animation. Adapted by a competent studio, David Production, Fire Force gets the top-quality production values. It’s no secret that whenever there is an action sequence, you’ll be guaranteed with visually appealing aesthetics. From the animation of expulsions, lighting effects, backgrounds, colors, sceneries, etc, they’re all top-notch. When it comes to character designs, however, there’re not many distinctions. Many of them have analogous facial expressions, drawings, hairs, and whatnot. And only having the animation as the single positive aspect of this show isn’t going to carry it.      <br />
<br />
For anyone who genuinely loves this show and thinks it’s a 10 out of 10 is beyond me. And so in conclusion, is this show worth watching? Hell no. However, if you’re a seasonal diver like me, you might as well dig through this season’s garbage in the hope to find some hidden gems. If not, at least your anime list has expanded.  <br />
<br />
Score: 3/10<br />

    We all know the timeless adage of &quot;the sequel is &lt;fill your expectations&gt; in every way&quot;, right? Unfortunately for such run-of-the-mill Shounen series a.k.a Fire Force, Season 1 provided mangaka Astushi Oobuko&#039;s signature touches from Soul Eater, and it&#039;s more cliche boringness with pacing that hurts the first impressions of both anime and manga fans. Fast forward a year later, and with this sequel season, David Production has improved a lot of the shoddy practices with Season 1 by taking them out and replacing them with better pacing and storytelling, How? Let&#039;s pursue and SPARK-AGAIN once more.<br />
<br />
Continuing where Season 1 left off with Shinra finding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367491">
        out the real truth of the dealings of the Evangelist and White-Clads&#039;, and as such with the tragic tale of his family and brother Sho (who&#039;s pretty much a puppet of the spokesman figure), the hero boy of Company 8 continues to dive deep into the world of Infernals and Adolla Links, and figure out a plan with the other suspicious Companies (not covered yet in Season 1) before the plan of the Evangelist ultimately takes precedence: being to gather the &quot;8 Pillars&quot; of Adolla Bursts to repeat the events of the Great Cataclysm once again, all while clearing out nuisances and stubs along the way.<br />
<br />
And right here, where Season 2 has a more grounded back-to-form storyline, is thanks to fellow David Production director Tatsuma Minamikawa who&#039;s replacing Season 1 director Yuki Yase, and pulling double-duty with doing both director and series composition duties. Though much-needed slower pacing than Season 1, you can tell that it&#039;s following the mangaka&#039;s storyline quite well, and although some areas were not quite as succinct as I would hope, at least it&#039;s a much better effort that while isn&#039;t helping fans both old and new click with and away from the overly-Shounen tropes, it is what it is, and paired together with David Production&#039;s stellar quality, makes for a much more enjoyable watch IMO.<br />
<br />
New to Season 2 is of course, more characters that may have varying levels of screentime in Season 1, but their character developments are fleshed out for the better. The stories and characters as follows:<br />
- The innocent schoolgirl-turned White-Clad Inka, to the Chinese Peninsula arc of Company 2&#039;s Takeru Noto a.k.a Juggernaut&#039;s home country and the weird case of talking animals with more Amaterasus/Tabernacles popping in their original case of creepiness.<br />
- More of the elusive and controversial practices of the Holy Sol Temple with Joker and Benimaru&#039;s investigations, to the reveal of Victor Licht&#039;s spy role that sends Company 8 off to the Haijima Industries arc of child experimentations gone awry with fire wielder Nutaku Son (under the influence of Rekka) and trainer Kurono (dubbed the Uncle Reaper). <br />
- Going deep into the personal stuff with Sister Iris&#039;s intentions of the recent happenings and her affiliation with the Church, THAT ONE hilarious but stupid short chapter on Assault and Tamaki&#039;s &quot;battle&quot; of fanservice, and Maki&#039;s family upbringings that caused a huge family rift of over-protection for such a valuable comrade in Company 8.<br />
- To end things up, Companies 2 and 8 again collaborating in the Nether and facing off the creepy Dr. Giovanni and White-Clads, to more training sessions, along with Juggernaut&#039;s and Tamaki&#039;s breakthrough of &quot;my character is stupidly weak, so I wanna surpass my limits here and now!&quot; (You can count on the former, but definitely not the latter, unless you want her to thank you in her &quot;Lucky Lecher&quot; syndrome.)<br />
Personally, I found it easier to stomach this season&#039;s same 2-cour offering that&#039;s densely packed into a fine package that only gets better in its progression. Still not great, but at least everything this time around is refined.<br />
<br />
And of course, how can I talk about the sequel season without the animation and OST to back things up. If you know David Production by now, their recent works (and YES, including Season 1, no matter how much love-hate relationship this show gets) have been pretty good and not having the studio commit to more than 2 shows simultaneously airing (plus Fire Force, duh) is a good predicament of the high-octane consistent quality that&#039;s being pumped out and giving the animation staff some space to breathe and deliver some amazing scenes and shots throughout. In the sound department though, while Season 1&#039;s OST is infinitely better than the offerings we got this time, at least there are some quality songs that are great on repeated listens on Spotify (a.k.a Aimer&#039;s &quot;SPARK-AGAIN&quot; and PELICAN FANCLUB&#039;s &quot;Desire&quot;, but sorry KANA-BOON, &quot;Torch of Liberty&quot; gets a pass from me).<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s one thing I can take away from this sequel, it&#039;s that IMO, Firecat Tamaki&#039;s &quot;fanservice&quot; was &quot;birthed out of necessity&quot; for character development, and though haters will lament this, it kinda services as &quot;justice&quot; for the tremendous amounts of hate thrown at her from her very first nauseating reveal in Season 1.<br />
<br />
The anime is much recommended over the manga, but that goes without saying how watchers would recommend people for this show to experience Fire Force at its very best. All in all, Season 2 is the definitive version of the show and a definite improvement overall. Certain expectations met or not is up for debates, but I&#039;d like to think that we all know what to expect by now.

    ***** This review contains spoilers for Fire Force (Enen no Shouboutai) Season 1 and Season 2*****<br />
<br />
<br />
        If you were to ask me “What is the most boring thing you can find when watching anime?” Some may say it is random menial activities or an uninteresting story, however for me; it is meaningless fights that fail to carry any sort of emotional weight with them. Fire Force is not a series I wanted to hate, in fact, it is the exact opposite. With an interesting and unique premise as well as it being made by both the author of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375992">
        Soul Eater and by the studio, David Productions which is well known for its work on the JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure franchise; it would not be a stretch to expect some worth in the show. Fire Force instead, left me disappointed and clueless as to what the point of the series was after the 48 episodes of both season 1 and season 2.<br />
<br />
	Fire Force is not entirely bad, starting with the good, it has a very unique premise surrounding infernals and how the characters in the show relate to/fight with them. It also has no shortage of great voice actors, including the likes of Kazuya Nakai who plays Akitaru Oubi, Mamoru Miyano who plays Benimaru Shinmon, and Kenjirou Tsuda who plays Joker. It does not fail in the production department either, fights are backed by stellar animation and sound design that gives them Impact. The side characters tended to have great development in their own respective arcs, examples includes Benimaru, Nataku, and even Joker. Additionally, the openings and endings are consistently amazing in their animation and songs, and the powers are creative in their use of fire in most cases. This however is where the good of the show ends, despite these points, Fire Force somehow manages to fail in every other aspect. <br />
<br />
	The characters in Fire Force are extremely generic and underdeveloped. Shinra has your basic “hero” archetype that barely gets expanded upon until the series passes the first season’s two cour mark. The entirety of the 8th division is not much better, from Arthur to Takehisa to Iris; I feel completely zero attachment to any of them. Instead, Fire Force decides to develop NOT the main cast, (which you are with for most the run time of the show) but it decides to develop the side characters who after their respective arcs, barely show up afterwards and sometimes never again. The characters in the show are characterized with shallow archetypes and the show seems to think that backstory is equivalent to development of the characters. Not to mention that the show itself keeps adding more characters on top which results in MORE characters to not care about. In episode 2 of season 2, Arthur is fighting Shinra after being possessed, the show proceeds to tell his backstory that was surprisingly missing from season 1, but after the fight, it did not feel like anything changed about him. This is constant throughout the show with the worst offender being Tamaki’s backstory where they attempt to display her “lucky lechery” as an important point of her character, (which is stupid but I’ll let it pass since I’ll take anything for Tamaki to not be a useless character who is only inserted into the show for brain dead ecchi fan service) however all of that work is instantly undone after her backstory, and she is turned back into the ecchi fan service character she was before. Speaking of Tamaki, she is easily THE WORST character in the show, devoted only to ecchi fan service that undermines the show as a whole. She contributes nothing to the betterment of the show but is actually a detriment, especially in season 1 where she wins an important fight BECAUSE SHE ACCIDENTALLY UNCLOTHES IN FRONT OF THE ENEMY.<br />
<br />
	Moving on to fights, due to the absolutely boring characters, there is literally no fight in the show that carries any form of emotional impact or meaning. The fights in this show are personified by the idea of “cardboard cut-outs fighting other cardboard cut-outs” with the occasional good animation. This made Fire Force a slog to watch because the fights are extremely prevalent and they are all almost always boring.  It’s like ordering a sub at Subway but instead of getting the sub, you only take bread, except the bread is cold and hard with a dab of salt sprinkled on top. The fights’ attempts at being impactful just end up as a laughable mess, the final fight of season 1 with both Shinra and his brother Sho was meant to be the climax of the season but it, like the rest of the show is a directorial disaster with bad cuts, framing, and pacing. The bs this fight pulled took away from my investment and attention I had when watching this fight by making it possible for fire to stop time itself. The problems with Fire Force also compound on each other in the Juggernaut vs. Orochi fight where it tried to make Juggernaut’s death impactful and to be a device to forward Tamaki’s development but because of his severe lack of character; I could not care less. <br />
<br />
	The plot is not much better and is incredibly tone deaf, having extreme whiplashes of seriousness and stale comedy or ecchi fan service. Not to mention the jokes have awful delivery, timing, and presentation, pretty much everything that makes a joke a joke is not there. Season 1 was all over the place in terms of plot but season 2 managed to focus the plot a little more (this is actually good thing by the way). However it continues to suffer from withholding information and being vague for no apparent reason, it neglects giving thorough explanations on the world, enemies, and concepts to the detriment of the viewers’ understanding of the show. On top of this, the plot twists are extremely forced and lack any sort of emotional weight tied in with cheap drama. The reveal of Rekka being evil in season 1 was incredibly weak as the viewer had no time to care for Rekka as a character for the twist to be effective. It also tried to create drama with Tamaki and Rekka but since we as the viewer know nothing about either of them at this point, it ends up horribly failing. This same thing happens later in season 1 during the Vulcan arc where it was revealed that Lisa was an informant meant to spy on Vulcan and later rat him out to Giovanni. I could not hold back laughter at this point in the arc because not only did she have no development for me to care about her, Vulcan did not even have any  either. But somehow Fire Force thought that by showing a 1 minute backstory of her, we as the viewer would care??? It only resulted in a shallow interaction that left me wondering if the story was being serious or not.<br />
<br />
	Now I would like to take the time here to talk about the final scene in season 2, revealing that Fire Force and Soul Eater are connected was one of the stupidest moves I saw in the entire series. It was like a f*ck you to the viewer, showing how desperate the series is trying to pander to its audience. Showing that they have to rely on Soul Eater to make the plot interesting and just screams like a move only for the cause of earning a little more cash.<br />
 <br />
	In conclusion, Fire Force was a directorial mess that cannot stand on its own. Failing to deliver on its unique premise, it instead presents generic characters, forced plot developments, and tone deaf comedy that makes the experience very boring and hard to watch. After watching these 48 episodes, I have not taken away anything meaningful from this series or its underdeveloped cast of characters.<br />

     UPDATED REVIEW : - finished 23 episodes and waiting for finale today <br />
firs t of all i apologize for all and any grammatical mistake I just typed it and did not bother to read through it .<br />
<br />
<br />
(personal note):- this is a very well adapted anime considering the fact that the manga for fire force is mediocre . the anime is really much much better and i would recommend the anime over the manga any day for this case .<br />
<br />
<br />
(short review) although the season 1 reviews are highly favorable<br />
there were certain areas were fire force was failing like  slow pacing .... season 2 improves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350479">
        on those with every 6 episode having a major plot line with minor info dumps here and there and just about 1 semi filler (about 5 mins of tamaki fan serv and comedy in  episode 18 which was still good).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
first of all we need to STOP THE JOJO FANBOIS from just force boycotting and spreading hate about this anime  just cause david is working on this and not jojo part 6 ... i am a jojo  cultist as well but an anime studio cannot just cash in on one title all time (ahem toei tried it ). fire force on its own is probably the best animated shounen title out there  maybe followed  by (if not tied to BNHA and KNY.<br />
ART:<br />
 the ANIMATION in the fight against the big infernal in ep1  was top notch , though the fight was not as well animated as a key scene like shinra vs shou and it was very well directed soft fanserv/recap episode (without being a 0.5 or ep 0 ) <br />
what followed was mindblowing camera angles and fights so well animated that even if you have no context on the story you still want to watch it through and through.<br />
there are times when CG fire was used but those were for fires in building s or unimportant areas .<br />
they eyes of all the pyrokinetics are so god damn gorgeous and when they light up the look PERFECT.<br />
MUSIC AND SOUND:<br />
the SOUND and theme s of season 1 are being re used and i have no complaints since they were real good by themselves but i can tell that they have added to them .<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
what i admire is the effort to provide even male fanservice for all them female or yaoi fans in episode 1  (im a straight male but buff (jojo) muscles are &lt;3) they did not try to be as creepy as imposing straight up yaoi on us and made it comedy or fanservice (depends on perspective) .<br />
the characters are still true to their season 1 selves and i can say they are more interesting than the basic archtypes at the very least some may say tamaki is a killjoy but if you can try and take a bit optimistic approach you can see her worthless ability is activated only in fights which contribute little to story.<br />
the newly introduced characters were honestly much better than the orignal cast (for me personally ) .that might be  since they stated to fit into the basic anime archetype of hero/MC , rival (arthur) , leader , love interest 1 (tamaki), love interest 2(sister),onee san (maki) etc.<br />
we also got to see one of the best duo of rogue s kickin ass in the most well animated way possible (cant reveal the duo since itd be a spoiler but trust me you will have just as much fun with those 2 eps as i did )<br />
STORY:<br />
the characters interact with the world in a very believable way no one is truly&quot;evil &quot; but they have thier own reason to do what they do so yes many unlikely as hell alliances are formed and are very carefully and politically well constructed to  make the WORLD of fire force feel alive and authentic.<br />
the fact that season 1 spoiler **<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 shinra  does not worry all that  much about his mother being a infernal after the big clifhanger reveal last season is a bit questionable though. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** spoiler end <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the STORY is compelling and each reveal (except a few) answers no questions but adds more of them  more hence it may get a little frustrating but never annoying .<br />
i think david is taking a break after this season two since they are leaving us at a litlle more relaxed point of the story and not a CLIFFHANGER like season 2 (although i dont blame them season 2 followed and was announced soon after).<br />
 i really hope this series gets the attention it deserves because for some reason mainly jojo starvation  this anime <br />
had heavy criticism and hell it even was pseudo boycotted in japan

    1. Story is huge downgrade from first season. Side characters got way too much space and the main characters progress got left behind, which is not always wrong, but there it&#039;s over the top.<br />
I can&#039;t say I enjoyed the story.<br />
2. art is great and I have enjoyed every fight. <br />
3. sound is good and I can&#039;t say anything wrong I guess.<br />
4. Characters are very good and they are pretty complex so I can understand, why they had so much space in the story. <br />
<br />
Over all I have enjoyed some parts of anime, but it&#039;s not like I can recommend it

    With the running Season 2, David Production continues to improve the series by taking the critics from the first season and fixing the issues watchers had with it.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story follows Shinra as he discovers more about the truth behind Spontaneous Human Combustion and his past. I&#039;ve heard some people saying that Season 1 was a mess of a story, just running around without context, but to be honest.... it feels like it. In the end you just finished Rekka and thats it. <br />
<br />
Not with this one. In the beginning you&#039;re already being introduced to the mysterious so-called &quot;First Pillar&quot; announcing the birth of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351564">
        Fifth Pillar. Soon enough, the city was on fire and Company 8 was in the quest of securing the Fifth Pillar. The pacing is stable yet leaving you wanting to know more (I eventually read the manga but I won&#039;t spoil it here).<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The art is maintained from the last season, even improved in my opinion. They focus more about small details that express more. However, the lines could&#039;ve been sharper and cleaner (I&#039;m not an artsy boi so please compensate)<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
The sound is a major improvement from last season. Sound effects have been improved and it&#039;s getting better and better. Take example from Episode 4 and 5. The action feels better and is more enjoyable with the compliment of sound.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
Character development is there. We get a massive character development for Shinra and Arthur and everyone else. However, it would be better in my opinion if the anime reduced the number of lewd (ahem, Tamaki) scenes. Including them is okay, but I don&#039;t think it would be a problem to remove the lewd parts that ruins the hype of a scene.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
Even though I&#039;ve read the manga, I can&#039;t help but feel astonished by watching the anime. The animation and the sound and everything gives me manga flashbacks, but this time is better.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
Fire Force Season 2 is a solid successor to its previously critical season, and I can&#039;t wait to see what David Production has more in the shelves for us.<br />

    Okay Im going to be honest , i actually like this anime. But the pace is super slow which means it is so boring i could watch this to make me fall a sleep. I would actually use x2 speed to save my time. And it is getting boring and boring every episodes.<br />
<br />
The fighting animations is often dope but you can&#039;t actually feel any danger among the main character. When a serious fight is happening they will make unnecessary jokes or fan-services.The fight also will be drag too long and that is because of the slow pacing.<br />
<br />
The character .Tamaki, useless character and annoying. Delivered unnecessary

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353382">
        fan-services on serious scene. Like if want to watch some boobs i could just go to watch some hentai. Juggernaut, joking on serious scene or crying like a cry baby. Shinra, okay shinra we get it you are a hero, we get it okay so stop mention it every god damn 3 seconds through out of the entire series. <br />
<br />
The only thing that I&#039;m looking forward to see is only about Joker and the fight scene in the opening so i will stick to the end of this season to see what would happen. I don&#039;t even give a damn about the boring Evangelist.<br />
<br />
The op is FIRE tho .Long live Aimer!<br />

    Wow, it has been a great ride with you guys. I really enjoyed every episode on it and i can say that this season was amazing! Let&#039;s start with the story.<br />
<br />
For the story, The story of this show is very unique and makes me curious about the continuation of each episode. That&#039;s how I feel in every episode. Their adventure to find answers to their every question makes me like this story, plus the main character in this show is very determined to be a great hero.<br />
<br />
For the art and sound, I gave it 9. To be honest, I like how they make the sound

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367500">
        of the fire from each character have a unique sound and sound like blazing. And for the animation/art, every scene looks so alive with so many details on it, and the colors look very colorful, making this show amazing.<br />
<br />
For the character, every character in this show is very likable, not only the main characters but supporting characters and villains can also be very liked. The story of a character&#039;s past, or a character&#039;s development from nothing to something, attracted my attention to exploring the roles of each character in this show. And as I mentioned earlier, the main character has high spirits, and his unyielding spirit is so fun to watch. It depends on each person, how they take the important points of each character in certain shows.<br />
<br />
Overall, every enjoyment I had while watching this show really paid off, every episode is worth waiting for, and if you still don&#039;t want to continue this season because the answers might not be convincing, then I will tell you that this season is worth watching. And one more thing, I&#039;m glad I found this show opening theme by accident, or else I might not be watching this masterpiece show.

Shonen as a genre is often regarded as the most generic or “run of the mill”, most of the time that is true. There are, however, a few exceptions to the rule, unfortunately, Fire Force is not one of them. Featuring a wide cast of mostly unexplored characters, a generic, incoherent plot and so much fanservice that it could make a softcore hentai jealous.<br />
<br />
The plot of Fire Force is so ordinary and orthodox it does not need an explanation, Shinra is a well mannered, good kid that has been bullied in the past. He has a hidden ability, Adolla Burst, and an

        evil abiding the rule of the Evangelist is after him. The area in which Fire Force struggles the most is its slowly paced story that adds nothing to its characters. Usually, a slow paced story allows characters to solidify their place in the story and to give the author room to characterize them, in Fire Force, however, none of that happens. The slow pace is not utilized at all and only serves to make the story even less enjoyable, which is prevalent in Season 2, it being one of the most boring things I have seen to date. The author tries to put a strong emphasis on the dark aspect of the world, but fails miserably, only adding death when it is necessary and making it happen to characters who had literally ten or less seconds of screen time. Not a single important death has happened to the main cast, which, in a world like Fire Force, seems unrealistic and improbable.<br />
<br />
Characterization is one of the, if not the most, important thing in building up a character. Fire Force offers a large cast but characterises it in a way that has been done numerous times. The whole cast is your typical shonen squad paired up with characters that do nothing except stand and show their massive boobs which have been overshown to the point of disgust. Characters like Tamaki and Hibana, who had potential to offer a breath of fresh air in the female section of shonen in general, felt like nothing more than relief characters to get your little man going, they had nothing else to offer or contribute to the story after their initial introductions. Joker is, along with Licht, the best character in Fire Force and its saving grace, saving it from being an absolute dumpster fire to becoming a slightly below average show. Joker and Licht offer a morally grey perspective on the world and emphasize their role of antiheros fairly well, Joker leaning more to the dark, and Licht to the light side. Their personalities and behaviours complement each other really well and they are overall a very dynamic and interesting pair to follow throughout the story. Joker as a character is something often seen in similar shows, but unlike the rest of the cast, Joker actually utilizes the tropes and stereotypes the author has given him to his advantage, making the story just a tad bit more enjoyable and the plot progression feeling smoother.<br />
<br />
The plot progression in Fire Force is just plainly awful. The monotone, stale and boring line it follows is so uneventful and poorly executed that the small things it does right just get overshadowed by this one huge flaw. The plot and its progression goes as follows: Shinra and the gang meet a new squad, become friends with them and then fight together, now repeat the process four times and you get this feeling of predictability and staleness. <br />
<br />
With all of its flaws plotwise, Fire Force is absolutely stunning in the visual and sound departments. David Production delivered, the animation is fabulous, fluid, pleasing to look at and the fight choreography is some of the best in the medium, putting the likes of Naruto, My Hero Academia and Dragon Ball to shame. Shinra VS Sho, while being of questionable quality plotwise, was one of the best choreographies in modern anime, often leaving me breathless with its high quality.<br />
<br />
The Openings and Endings were all high quality, “Torch of Liberty” by Kana-Boon being my favorite in the series. From the animation to the rhythm and “vibe”, each song was beautiful in its own right and is definitely one of Fire Force’s highlights.<br />
<br />
After finishing Fire Force, I let out a huge sigh of relief. While I expected at least a small upgrade from Season 1, Season 2 managed to disappoint me even more, with the plot becoming more and more stale and incoherent as the episodes went by, and the characters staying the same no matter what happened. Character development in Fire Force was nonexistent, happening only when it was of the absolute necessity.<br />
<br />
Fire Force is a generic, classic shonen that brings nothing new to the table. In contrast to many of its predecessors, it does not utilize this formula well at all and fails miserably in trying to make a dark and twisted story out of something that was not meant to be a story like that, feeling more like a parody than a serious dark fantasy. While it is definitely not the worst anime I have seen, it is not something I will look at fondly in the future, I hope that, if Season 3 comes out, it can at least fix some of the mistakes its previous 2 Seasons have made.<br />

    The best thing about this show is definitely the animation.  It&#039;s a very nice looking show.<br />
The main issue with it though is just how unengaging it is.  This show is just a generic shounen with a fire theme and while that could be okay, it&#039;s really hard to get invested.  This might be an issue with the pacing, I&#039;m not sure.  It definitely got worse in the second season which leads me to believe that someone in the production of this show stopped caring.  The story isn&#039;t that bad, don&#039;t get me wrong, it just feels like once you&#039;ve seen

    First off, I want to put it out there that I really really like this anime and this is also my first review. However, this season fell short to me in terms of mainly plot so much that I had to make this my first review and I’ll explain more below. <br />
<br />
SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />
<br />
Plot: 4/10<br />
The storytelling this season felt really messy. It felt a lot like a number of arcs were just following the exact same script but with different characters (go on a mission, white clads appear, fight, climax about destroying the whole area, plot armour saves the day) and not a huge amount of

        development in the story in general. Also, the arcs didn’t feel like they related to one another that well probably mainly because the transitions were done pretty badly. <br />
<br />
Just generally, in my opinion the pacing for this season was worse compared to the first season because some of the arcs felt wayyyy too drawn out (like the sixth pillar, haijima and Chinese peninsula arc). But they were enjoyable for some of the fight scenes and comedy. <br />

Characters: 6/10<br />
This time we got a couple fun new characters (excluding Maki’s brother, he was pretty annoying) and we got some development on some of the old characters which was nice (especially on Joker, his story was really well done). However, I have to point out the elephant in the room which is Tamaki. Her character feels more like wasted potential to me because all she does is exist for fan service. Yes, we did finally get her backstory but them somehow trying to make the whole lucky lecher thing into a tragic past thing was very awkward and because of that I couldn&#039;t take it seriously at all. I mean at least she did get *some* development that’d hopefully help out in the next season. <br />
<br />
Art and animation: 10/10<br />
Absolutely stunning as usual. The visuals are to die for, easily one of the best in current running shonen and the fights are amazing. David’s production did really great work on this. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9.5/10<br />
The sound effects are really great also, maybe on the same level as the visuals. Only downside is I’d say I didn’t really like any of the openings or endings this season that much compared to the first. <br />
<br />
Overall: 6.6/10<br />
It was really enjoyable for the most part but the plot, Tamaki and pacing issues make it very hard to give it a stronger score.

    Y&#039;know. When I finished season 1, my biggest thought was: &quot;that was fun, I hope they have a higher budget for the next season&quot;.<br />
<br />
While season 1 is fine in its own right, it suffers from weird directing (cuts and shots that are confusing), dull dialogue and a run of the mill shonen story. You could tell that, in terms of quality, David Production poured all eggs into one basket: the combat.<br />
You&#039;ve probably seen videos or tik toks of Fire Force with flashy fight scenes and bass boosted sound design. And yes, the action is really well done with good animation, but everything else kinda suffers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371371">
        and looks bland and stiff.<br />
<br />
These issues are still prevalent in season 2 and I dropped it because I wasn&#039;t invested enough to care about what was happening. Once the talking animals showed up I was kinda checked out tbh. That subplot honestly felt like a filler arc even though they learned stuff that ties into the main story. Watching the show started feeling like a chore and after several scenes of stiff characters standing and talking to cool, dynamic fight scenes to more stiff dialogue I was not interested in finding out about the story, I just wanted to watch fire wizards fight fire demons and other fire wizards. <br />
The fan service was also a little annoying, it just felt forced and it wasn&#039;t funny at all.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have much else to say honestly. The fighting is the show&#039;s biggest selling point and they do deliver on that front very well, but the story isn&#039;t that interesting to me and, except for the fight scenes, the animation was kinda stiff and bland. 4/10

    Fireforce Ni No Shou is the second season and continuation of the anime based off the manga of the same name by Atsushi Okubi. It continues straight after the first season&#039;s storyline where we are introduced to giant infernals that take are a lot harder to take down, while fireforce company 8 takes down these infernals and go on various missions, they stumble upon the white clad and the Evangelist that have started to set their plans into action, now fireforce company 8 along with the majority of the companies team up to take down the Evangelist once and for all. While this season does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367688">
        have some better fight scenes than the first one, ultimately this second season is an inferior product compared to it&#039;s predecessor. This season feels more like its a setting stage for the final confrontation of the fire soldiers and the evangelist rather than a continuation of the story, not to mention that I&#039;m not hyped  at all for season 3 nor their final battle if anything watching this season felt tedious, boring and annoying, I didn&#039;t feel that same satisfaction and entertainment that I felt from watching season 1, hell this season even made me consider dropping the show as a whole. It has the same jokes, same problems, same cliches that the first season has which applies to every shounen lol like power of friendship and give me power to protect my loved ones lmao, but back on topic this time it was done way worse than before. There were times when I was putting off watching episodes off this season, and I could have reviewed this last night but I didn&#039;t because I just didn&#039;t feel like it, looking on the bright side tho there are some fight scenes from this season that I enjoyed more than the first one, like the guy with tephrosis and Shinra vs Nataku Son, Juggernaut vs the two white clad guys, Joker and the company 4 captain vs the temple of Sol and of course the training arc on the last few episodes was also good, unfortunately these little moments that I liked ultimately did not manage to save this tragic garbage of a season. I also noticed that this season tried to speedrun it&#039;s source material and let me tell you that just doesn&#039;t work, the pacing in this season was just bad, which is a shame since the first one&#039;s pacing matched perfectly with the show&#039;s tone and atmosphere, while the second season&#039;s facing just didn&#039;t work out for it.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-Greater fight scenes<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Horrible pacing<br />
-Shit OP and ED<br />
-Tried to make another season one but failed really hard<br />
-Story didn&#039;t progress instead acted as a lackluster setting stone for a future battle that&#039;s most likely not going to be executed properly anyway<br />
-Ultimately ended up being more of a generic shounen than it&#039;s predecessor which is feat of it&#039;s own <br />
-Failed in trying to hype up the audience for the inagural third season<br />
-Less entertaining and fulfilling to watch<br />
-Got boring<br />
-Lackluster story<br />
-The new characters they introduced where not good they were just annoying<br />
-Shittier animation<br />
-Recycled the same troupes and cliches of the shounen genre<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Fireforce Season 2 is a failure of a second season to a already mediocre shounen series, unfortunately this season has ultimately made everything that was salvageable about the first season dissapear for me, and now I&#039;m strongly thinking about  dropping this anime as whole. This season was a waste of time and some anime viewers may have even dropped this show by now, since let&#039;s face it if you don&#039;t stop watching by this point then you just have shit taste and enjoy dogshit anime. I give Enen No Shouboutai: Ni No Shou a 5/10 for my overall anime rating.

    I feel like the only people I see talking about Fire Force outside of Fire Force forums are those who dropped it in or shortly after the first cour. And they always do it with such a weird tone, like they&#039;re opinion on the entire anime is definite and final. I mean I kind of see why it&#039;s heavily dropped among certain types with the way Ookubo writes things at the start, but<br />
SEASON 2 SO GOOD THOUGH<br />
like the story actually started getting really interesting, we got some great character development, coming back to previous events, solving mysteries, getting answers, going to  C H I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367558">
        N A, and cute Tamaki/Iris/Maki moments. <br />
I noticed that the story is actually super well planned out; arcs are based off events from other arcs, revelations and twists make sense when thought about, and characters get stronger only when they really try to, not just when they need it.<br />
Just like the first season DavidPro could not have made a better adaption, everything is handled excellently and beautifully, and I&#039;m personally very partial to stylization like they use it here. The second OP for this season is a BANGER! And Inferno for the finale&#039;s end credits tops it off nicely.<br />
Overall I found the second season markedly better than the first, which isn&#039;t saying a ton but it&#039;s really really good.

    A noticeable improvement upon the first season. <br />
<br />
When I saw that the second season of Fire Force was coming out, I reluctantly decided that I would give it a go. I had a very mixed reaction to the first season. It had some great animation, sound design, and world-building, but was held back because of bad framing, poorly written characters, and eye-rolling fanservice. I am happy to say that this season made great strides to correct those mistakes.<br />
<br />
The season starts off a little slow as we are still dealing with Infernals that are supposed to a threat, but everyone watching knows they don’t matter. While

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367506">
        the beginning of the season is pretty on par with last season, the moment I became hooked was on episode 12 where we get arguably the best episode of the entire series. After that point, it is just banger episode after banger episode for most of the season.<br />
<br />
There is a lot more action in this season against the Evangelists (the actual entertaining villians) which keeps the episodes pleasing to watch. There are also new characters introduced that are actually somewhat interesting and some fan favorite characters like Joker receive some great backstories. Hell, even the fanservice is more enjoyable in this series, as it is toned down some and used in a way unique to this series.<br />
<br />
Speaking of such, this season really carved Fire Force an identity separate from similar Shounen series. It doesn’t take itself too seriously and just tries to have fun. This season embraces the wacky and over-the-top nature of its source material, like it tells the viewer “Yes, we will show you flashy action scenes every episode, then give you some shameless fanservice and you will like it”. And I’ll be damned, but I really did like it.<br />
<br />
Now, obviously my rating for this season is a 7 not 10, so I do have some problems with it. It does start out pretty slow, with my rating at some point being a 5 out of 10. They still pad out episodes with characters not making obvious decisions in fights that could easily end them. Also the fanservice can occasionally be way too overt and unlikable like in season one.<br />
<br />
But overall, I was pleasantly surprised with how this season turned out. It surpassed my expectations and I am looking forward to watching season 3 when (and if) it comes out.<br />
<br />
It is closer to a 6 than an 8

    For the past few years, I&#039;ve been so trash that I don&#039;t even have the energy to live, but this game is so much fun. It&#039;s a quality that makes me want to live a little longer.<br />
　DVD sales of &quot;Enen no Shouboutai: Ni no Shou&quot; didn&#039;t do well, but since the second season was announced at the end of the first season, it&#039;s likely that they were planning to make the second season from the beginning. There was plenty of stock of the original work at the time.<br />
　The good thing about this anime adaptation is that it is mostly faithful to the original work, just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351691">
        like the first season. And while it&#039;s not at the level of a monster, the drawings are relatively stable and hard working. At the very least, you can feel the love and seriousness for the work.<br />
　The original good point of the second season so far is the OP. The level of the video itself is high, but the direction is also very well done. On top of that, the lyrics stick. Most of the OPs of anime are made for the work and if you like the anime, it sticks, but if not, it is hard to get into it. Even if you do get hooked, you&#039;ll get bored unless you like the work to a certain extent. Well, the lyrics of this song are of course linked to the work of Flame Flame, but by all means, the passionate lyrics give power to the people who have been living a ragged life a little bit more to do their best. Honestly, I was so moved that I cried, and personally, I feel like it&#039;s been a while since we&#039;ve had a great song that&#039;s been on the level of being a decade player. I&#039;ve been watching a few anime in the past few years, and out of the several I&#039;ve seen, there are a few that I&#039;ve come to love. However, I don&#039;t think any of the songs have been this numb in the past few years.<br />
<br />
　Soul Eater was the same way, but the battles are more flashy and interesting when inflation is on the rise, so I have high hopes for the range of battles in the second season.<br />
