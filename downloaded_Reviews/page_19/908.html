    A huge disappointment!<br />
<br />
I have been a Naruto fan for ages and I have to say a HUGE Naruto fan. But there is one thing I cannot accept...when the author turns everything you like about the show to dust.<br />
<br />
This movie is set somewhere after the last manga chapter (By the way, didn&#039;t like the ending either.). Naruto is like a star in Konoha. Everybody loves him, he has a lot of fans, especially among young girls. This part was beautiful, I have to admit. I really enjoyed the feels when watching Naruto and his “Will of Fire” after all the suffering he had to go through.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186730">
        It was also nice to see all the other characters, especially Kakashi as a hokage looks so epic! And the intro where they summarized the whole story in an awesome ink-like animation was so amazing!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that&#039;s all. The rest of the film is not worth watching. You know, something is probably wrong when scenes that are supposed to be sad or dramatic makes you laugh. I found the whole plot really ridiculous and stupid. It had such a filler-like atmosphere. Some random villain comes here to marry Hinata and the Moon falls on the Earth to destroy it. Seriously?<br />
<br />
Plus most of the film is just about Hinata dealing with her love for Naruto and everybody forcing Naruto to understand what love is, to make her happy. Is Naruto soap opera or what? I don&#039;t mind romance in anime but this romance was so ridiculous and kinda forced or how to say that. I am not sure what to think about the intentions of the author. It was like “Umm now let&#039;s add a cool fight with...eh who? Well let&#039;s make someone random up aaand now...hm let&#039;s bring romance again, never mind just place there Hinata and her shy face, that&#039;s enough.”<br />
<br />
So the result? If it wasn&#039;t Naruto I would probably say it was an interesting movie, not memorable but not bad. The thing is that it is Naruto after all. It was supposed to be the last movie that closes one era in Naruto universe. It brought us a filler with a childish plot and distorted characters form the original anime instead.<br />
<br />
I expected more, much more dattebayo!

    This movie takes place a few years after the fourth ninja war ended. Typically speaking it shows Naruto the clumsy, dense and knuckle headed ninja get even more acknowledged then before. Receiving gifts from every girl, with the exception of Hinata. Since Hinata is too nervous to give her gift and a misguided villain, Toneri interrupts the romance. The comedy continuously got me cracking up. This movie is the door to Naruto and Hinata getting together, if you came in expecting something else, then you clearly need a nail through the head. <br />
<br />
At the beginning, we see Hinata being bullied… Again lol. Except this is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178111">
        actually filmed in a different location. Naruto appears and once again saves hinata in a comedic fashion. In this movie, the viewpoints of Naruto and Hinata are shown various times as well, which normally makes the viewer think whether these people will ever fall in love. It literally takes at least an hour for the dense Naruto to notice Hinata’s feelings and start reciprocating.<br />
<br />
Shikamaru is smart as always, Sai always makes me laugh as I watch the movie, Sakura has finally gained my respect for what she did for Naruto (I will not spoil anything) and I think Hinata has changed my view on her. These characters are shown rather well. The other shinobi of Konoha 11 also get some screen time. If anything they get more than enough screen time, unlike Tenten who just made a small appearance. <br />
<br />
I see Toneri as a plot device to bring both Naruto and Hinata together. Sadly enough, I already knew he would not succeed in getting Hinata. Toneri’s goal was to change the world because of the wars that continuously happened. I find this villain sad, mainly because of what he has gone through and the suffering that he put on himself (Still trying not to spoil anything). The end of the movie (after the credits) is full of feels, so I warn everyone that is going to watch the movie to wait until the credits finish. The music almost brought me on the verge of tears, seeing a knuckle headed ninja finally become “his dream” and much more shows so much. After all these years of following Naruto, I am glad I stuck this far. I enjoyed the voice acting, the voice actors portrayed their characters amazingly well. I found Toneri a bit odd. Probably because I wished he had more screen time, but I did feel for what he received before the end of the movie. <br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the living hell out of this movie. It is a great send off to the legendary Naruto series and the character himself. Following Naruto from his knuckle headed times to his adult life was worth it and this movie just brought that feeling out further.<br />

    Taking place after the end of the manga, it has been two years. Naruto is seen as a hero and all the girls want to be with him. However, the one girl that wants to be with him the most, Hyuuga Hinata, cannot bring herself to confess her love yet. However, that will be put on hold not that the world is in danger from the moon falling apart and crashing onto earth no thanks to a lousy villain named Toneri who for personal reasons, is after members of the Hyuuga clan. <br />
<br />
The beginning of the movies shows why Hinata is initially attracted to Naruto

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171155">
        so it adds more to things from her point of view. I think the series does a good job of showing the movie through the eyes of both Naruto and Hinata. The movie movies at a moderate pace but unfortunately, a lot of the more awesome characters from the series (why I won&#039;t reveal due to spoilers) are reduced to a millisecond fanservice cameos just to remind us they exist. Sakura who has been infamous for being useless does have some decent use in this movie and does bring some convenient contribution. Shikamaru shows he is a capable leader and Sai is mostly used as bad comic relief. <br />
<br />
Toneri is just a very boring, unoriginal and lame villain for every reason you can practically think of (once again without giving away any spoilers). Despite his plot, he comes across as non-threatning and has the charisma of drying white paint on interior walls. I found the love story between Hinata and Naruto a lot more interesting. <br />
<br />
I say the make or break for viewers is how their favorite character are used in what is supposed to be &quot;the last movie.&quot; If your favorite character despite being alive and active is not used to their fullest potential, it may piss you off. If you don&#039;t mind that, then hey, cool. <br />
<br />
The character design does an effective job in making the cast looking like they are in their late teens and I cannot complain about it. They are taller, have more mature faces, etc. It gets the job done. The action relies too much on the 360 foreground/background turnaround way too much for me. The final fight does play homage to a lot of the older fights as well. I also enjoy Hinata&#039;s close range combat fighting as well and is a fun representation of southern style Kung Fu. <br />
<br />
The background music as usual is an excellent use of traditional Japanese acoustics and percussions carried by the rhythm of modern guitar licks which everyone can get behind. The ending theme is just too generic and trendy in comparison to current Japanese music trends for my tastes. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is superb and I think Sakura&#039;s voice sounds appropriately more mature out of all the characters. Naruto still sounds the same though I think his voice could have been a bit deeper for his age but glad to see they kept their cast (unlike the new Initial D anime). However, Fukuyama Jun, most famous as the voice of Code Geass from Lelouch as the voice of Toneri doesn&#039;t exhibit that same powerfulness in this performance in which you can blame on a writing and voice directing issue as opposed to a voice actor issue. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is mostly a decent representation of what people love and hate about Naruto. A good fraction of the fans will find this moderately satisfying. Haters will hate it for why they hate Naruto.

    The Last Naruto Movie is a perfect ending to the Naruto Saga. Everything from the technical aspects such as the exquisite animation and magnificent music to the intricate story and character developments are wonderfully implemented in this perfectly paced finale.<br />

The gradual change from the cycle of hatred to the understanding of love throughout the legend of Naruto makes this a very appropriate ending point for the series as it tackles the issues of self-preservation versus the selfless; a direct contrast to the war-torn era of despair and anxiety that preceded Shippuden. By focusing on the minor characters and integrating the theme of love, The Last

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172073">
        offers a fresh take on the narrative and allows deeper and more spiritual developments for the main characters. While the absence of moral ambiguity is missed thanks to the lack of more sophisticated characters such as Kakashi or Sasuke, the inclusion of more retrospective dilemmas offers a fitting conclusion to Naruto&#039;s journey. Since we&#039;ve already dealt with Sasuke&#039;s inner-turmoils, it makes sense that the final story showcases external views on it&#039;s diverse cast of characters and focuses on presenting a genuine romance between two inextricably linked characters through superbly written dialog, subtle symbolism and heartwarming metaphorical implications. Of course this is a different and much more abbreviated link than that of the intertwined fates of Ashura/Indra - Naruto/Sasuke as it&#039;s a much more personal exploration, but that&#039;s what makes it a perfect ending; it concludes the initially personal journey of the main character with a personal reconciliation, much like how the Manga resolved the retrieval of Sasuke.<br />
<br />
Wonderful ending to a wonderful, albeit flawed, series!

    &quot;I never give up. I never go back on my word. That is my way of the ninja!&quot; <br />
- Naruto Uzumaki of the Hidden Leaf Village<br />
<br />
(If the ending of Naruto hasn’t been released yet and you didn’t finish the manga, I highly recommend you don&#039;t watch this movie. This movie is not for you yet. Thank you)<br />
<br />
The Last: Naruto the Movie. Don&#039;t let the name trick you for this is definitely not the last time we will see Naruto. However we may never see another Naruto Movie or series for that matter. Now for all you people who are saying &quot;No, You’re wrong, there’s going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178449">
        to be a Buroto Movie coming out, I saw it&quot;. Yes BUROTO. About Bolt, Naruto&#039;s son.<br />
<br />
The Last is a movie I witness in the cinema so my experience may differ to yours in terms of art and sound, for I saw it in HD and surround sound. However even if you watch it on potato you know this movie was pretty good.<br />
<br />
Naruto: The Last is the seventh movie and probably the last Naruto Shipudeden movie to come out. But don&#039;t let this bring you down, this definitely was a good way to finish an awesome series. This movie is definitely pleasing to all the people who hated the pointless romantic that didn&#039;t go anywhere in the series, not that it was pointless. It had a reason, somehow. <br />
<br />
Naruto: The Last, is the back story of the love story that is Hinata and Naruto. Which I personally wanted to find out because the manga explained absolutely nothing. <br />
<br />
The starting scene is about Hinata and Naruto&#039;s first encounter. And guess what she’s getting bullied... surprising... and Naruto is there to save! But gets beaten up, well we didn’t see that one coming did we. This is most likely the scene where Hinata starts develops feelings for Naruto.<br />
<br />
Past like 14 years where Naruto is now 19, a hero and still single. This is two years after the fourth Great War and sasuke is still nowhere to be seen, typical. Naruto, now has fans. Guess being a war hero is a real turn on for the ladies you know what I’m saying. The villain of our story is Toneri Ōtsutsuki, a descendant of the Sixth path&#039;s younger brother Hamura Ōtsutsuki, who lived on the moon. A person from the moon. Great... A human that lives on the moon. Logic at its finest. I&#039;m pretty sure there is like 0 oxygen particles on the moon, but this is anime so I will say no more. He desires to destroy the earth by using Byakugan to create a weapon called the Tenseigan, an upgraded Byakugan used to move the moon so it will collide with earth. It’s an alright story line but it wasn’t great. However this is not the juice of the story for there is another plot happening.<br />
<br />
Hinata and Naruto’s relationship finally, for the love of god advances to a more than friendship which, one, FINALLY, and two I think is weird that happen all in one mission for Naruto to realize his in love with Hinata, do people fall in love in 12 hours or something? Since I watched so many romantic animes I was expecting Naruto to fit the standard of a normal Rom com. However this is a Naruto, not some rom com, and it’s a movie so we can’t’ fit a whole progressive romances. I also feel the romance was also a little force, just because the fact that Naruto learns that Hinata is in love with him, he will be like I have to like her to now or I’ll look bad. But they did a good job of showing Naruto that Hinata is in love with you, so you better do something about it. What I also like about this movie was the fact it stated out loud NARUTO IS NOT IN LOVE WITH SAKURA. I believe a lot of fan that supported narusaku and the writers were like well… Too bad, and this movie proved it Naruto and Sakura were meant to be friends. <br />
<br />
The last also did a good job with the sound and art. The beautiful black and white scenes to the colourful fight scenes that fills your imagination with false hope of you becoming a ninja. I JUST WANT TO BE A NINJA. They include old ost and from the previous anime series and turned it new, which I thought was so ingenious. I love the old ost and it was great to hear it again one last time.<br />
<br />
Although I had a lot I didn’t feel right about this movie, I definitely enjoyed it. I like how the writers didn’t forget about the explanation to a romance that needed to be told and did this in a great movie. This was an excellent way to end a long running series and I hope to see more things to come from our knuckle head ninja.<br />

    Naruto the Last implies the last movie of the series. But who know? A new movie may come out telling the story of next generation. For me, this last movie has proved to be a good ending. I am afraid that any more movie would spoil it. Saying that though, I will definitely buy it if they are going to make another movie dedicated to other major character, for example, Sasuke and Sakura.<br />
<br />
This movie is much dedicated to Naruto and Hinata. From an isolated kid until having a bunch of good friends and becoming the hero of shinobi world, what Naruto lack of is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179416">
        girl friend. The story reveals the reason why Hinata starts to pay her attention on Naruto. The little girl has her liking on Naruto from the very beginning, and that feeling has last for more than 10 years, as long as I watched Naruto from primary school. <br />
<br />
As usual, the movie has a villain, a bishie that acts as the catalyze for NaruHina relationship. The story revolves pretty much about how Naruto realize Hinata feeling towards him, after confession but being rejected and Hinata being seized by enemy, finally only understand his true feeling and plays the &quot;man&quot; role to save Hinata.<br />
<br />
In addition to the main theme, the movie also reveals the ultimate form of byakugan, which possess the power to control the moon. Well, byakugan has finally given attention providing its lower significance than sharingan in the sequel. <br />
<br />
Other than that, other main characters are pretty plain in this movie, but you get to see the slightly mature looks of them. Shikamaru, Sai and Sakura have slightly higher appearance due to the reason they team up with Naruto to save the world, where Shikamaru plays the role as team leader, Sai as transportation provider and joker, Sakura to resolve Naruto feeling, AND most importantly, she reveals that Naruto like her only because he  want to compete with Sasuke. (which implies that Naruto does not like Sakura all these years)<br />
<br />
Overall, the movie is a great one with some minor flaw especially during fighting scene. The fighting may not be as thrilling to everyone but who care, this movie is about beautiful love story. Naruto and Hinata eventually become married couple, and their wedding party is revealed in the ending song. Not forget to mention that the opening and ending song is outstanding. Also, do not take a quick escape from cinema as you do not want to miss the scene of their family moment with their child many years later. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend you to watch it if you are big fans of Naruto, and of course NaruHina fans.<br />

    One Word: Disappointed<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the word that is truly describe this movie. Why? Because it is disastrous. I thought this movie would be great or epic because the one who created it none other than the creator himself, Kishimoto. Boy, was i wrong, it made the other movie look great.<br />
<br />
So lets go to the review<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
The story begins 2 years after chapter 699 and now Naruto is 19 years old. It starts out in a night where Hinata tried to gave Naruto a scarf that she made herself but she didn&#039;t had the chance because her sister(Hanabi) was captured by some ninjas that were ordered by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186490">
        Toneri(the villain). Now Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, Shikamaru and Sai try to save Hanabi from the big bad villain. <br />
<br />
It is not the story that was bad but the execution, lazy writing and bad directing made the movie really sucks<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: 5&amp;9<br />
The art IMO was average, in the manga it looked very cool but in here it looks stupid. But the animation was the winner because it&#039;s stunning, fluid, crisp and everythig that you want from an anime that came out this year. Boy, you should see rasen shuriken it was jaw-breaking!<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Naruto widely known for its great soundtrack and OST but this time around it isn&#039;t. It was very forgettable but the ED is okay i guess... The VA&#039;s is okay nothing spectacular to talk around here.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
I will only review 3 characters because i think these are the most important one.<br />
<br />
Naruto: He&#039;s still the same airhead that you remember all the time, what i hate about his character in the movie,is that in the middle of the movie when he confess to Hinata (wow he did it) let just say Hinata rejected him. Naruto feels so sad and heartbroken it&#039;s like he&#039;s the only who&#039;s in pain. Seriously, how stupid can he get?<br />
<br />
Hinata: At first it was really refreshing seeing her trying to confess naruto. But later on she&#039;s only a plot device to carry the show and all she do is sewing a SCARF, but do you know what role she gets? She is thought to be the white eye princess and they didn&#039;t care to explain why or how about it <br />
<br />
Toneri: A 1-!dimensional character, kinda hard to explain this one. Do you watch Fairy Tail? Yeah...he&#039;s just like that. A very bad villain with no real motive or backstory that believeable<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
Despite all the bad stuff i kinda enjoy this movie, it is the last of its franchise (i hope) so i&#039;m happy with it, not counting boruto either because seriously for what. Oh yeah i forgot to mention there is a prologue before the movie and it was damn cool<br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
It is not a bad show nor a great one, it just your average movie but please watch it because it is our beloved Naruto<br />
<br />
With that thank you for reading, i hope its helpful<br />
<br />
By the way it is my first review and english is not my main language<br />

    &quot;If you want to destroy my scarves~ Pull this thread as I walk away...&quot; - Weezer<br />
<br />
This movie was absolutely dreadful, as expected of a Naruto filler. I&#039;d give it two thumbs down, 0/5 Stars, but 1 is the lowest score I&#039;m allowed to give on myanimelist. Essentially Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 7 - The Last is nothing more than a marketing ploy to milk this franchise for what its worth by impliedly promising this is the last time we will ever see Naruto and friends. Here&#039;s what you need to know. <br />
<br />
1. It&#039;s super cheesy (&quot;I will punch you until you learn the meaning of friendship!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186508">
        Dattebayo!!!&quot; - Naruto)<br />
2. There&#039;s plot holes galore (None of the Antagonist&#039;s reasonings for his actions make any sense. Why does he live on the moon with a bunch of little slave children? Seriously, does no one care about the little slave children?)<br />
3. There&#039;s very little fighting (unless you consider raves and light shows fighting)<br />
4. There&#039;s no plot progression (nothing gets resolved, and we don&#039;t learn anything new)<br />
<br />
(Spoiler Alert: Because no one should be watching this for the plot)<br />
<br />
Really, the best things about this movie was the peanut gallery humor and finding out Naruto loves Hinata. Oops, did I spoil that for anyone? Yeah, didn&#039;t think so. Speaking of humor, the &quot;I&#039;m going to take your eyes&quot; gag of Naruto canon has got to be the most hilariously pretentious meme I could ever imagine. Kishi must have been on crack when he came up with that one. And for those holding out a shred of hope Naruto and Sasuke would team up one more time Avengers-style (which would have been awesome considering how the manga ended and the fact that they are literally the two most powerful beings in the universe), they don&#039;t even meet in the movie. Sasuke gets less than 10 seconds of screen time, only to blow up the plot even more by saying &quot;Hey, I pretty much could have done this movie by myself if only I weren&#039;t too busy avoiding my clingy girlfriend&#039;s vajayjay because I&#039;m totally into dudes.&quot; The graphics quality is obviously high but the animation and choreography is pathetic. The music is Naruto 101. <br />
<br />
&quot;Last The: Movie Naruto The&quot; (or whatever the fuq its called) can be sum up as such - Girl meets boy. Girl likes boy. Boy and Girl are destined to be together. Aw... Creepy Guy wants to destroy the world, but he has another equally important agenda - marry Girl. Why? Because saving the world is not enough motivation for Boy. Creepy Guy coerces Girl to his castle, then gives her the freedom to walk around and destroy his plans. Boy is worried Girl left him for Creepy Guy because everyone knows men who want to kill everyone are SoOoOo Dreamy~ *cough* Sasuke *cough*. Creepy Guy says &quot;You cannot punch me! Hahaha!&quot; Boy punches Creepy Guy. World is saved, because why not? Seriously guys, most fan fiction is better than this.

    [Spoilers]<br />
<br />
Watched it last night and I must admit this is the first naruto movie I have seen. I can&#039;t compare it to others but I did enjoy it overall. The animation was really nice the entire film and the music, from what I remember, fitted pretty well. I&#039;m a sucker for romance so I probably enjoyed the film more than I otherwise would have. The romance was a little forced but still worked for me.<br />
<br />
My biggest upset about the film would have to be the lack of Sasuke. Even though I don&#039;t particularly like him as much as other characters, I would have liked to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178425">
        see him in 699.5, if only more than just especially as he was featured on the poster that they gave out at the screening of the film. /u/Exiliah posted a picture of it for those who are yet to see it. On that note, I also would have enjoyed Toneri having a bit more moves and Hinata being a bit stronger.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching the end credits with the and the music the accompanied it. And am glad I stayed around to watch the scene right at the end. Unfortunately there was no mention of the but as /u/brendos1er said, it might just be down to not yet having the licensing for it.<br />
<br />
Overall I would rate this an 8/10 and would recommend anyone who is a fan of Naruto to go and watch this at some point, if not buy it. I look forward to watching some of the other Naruto movie&#039;s now to see how it all compares.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
Just a side note, the atmosphere was one of the most enjoyable ones I&#039;ve had. When someone in the audience shouted out &quot;That&#039;s my boy!&quot; and the entire audience clapped/laughed. There were a few other instances of this and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

    Writers Note: This is by no means a professional review in which I break down each nitty gritty detail of the film and dissect and critically analyse it. This was just something I wrote up on the spot after watching the film from the perspective of someone who while never really got to far into Shippuden holds Part 1 pretty dear to his heart with it being one of the biggest shows from my childhood.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
From a story &amp; writing perspective Naruto The Last was pretty mediocre though as a piece of entertainment it was a pretty descent time.<br />
<br />
The Bad: The whole save the world plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178329">
        from this new bad guy who has suddenly shown himself was certainly shoehorned in and the antagonist himself was as cliche as they come. Like the series many characters who should&#039;ve played a big part ended up only having very minor rolls (Sasuke himself only had about two minutes of screen time the entire film yeah that&#039;s right you know Sasuke, Arguably the second most important character in the series) and the main cast we were given had some questionable choices like why they chose to have Sai be one of the main characters in the film, Yeah his cool but I feel like their were characters who could&#039;ve used screen time far more then him. Basically the film was predictable from the start and while it is cannon to the story it didn&#039;t do much that set itself apart from any other battle shounen film however-<br />
<br />
The good: The romance aspect in this while feeling a little rushed was done in a nice manor, Simply put it was sweet relationship as opposed to just making me sigh at it. The soundtrack like the OST for the series was great with orchestra versions of some of the songs from the series. The animation was the best looking film in the series by far and even managed to do CGI well, Shocking I know! Their were some good comedic moments and even a few tender moments between characters specifically the scenes with Sakura I surprisingly liked. However while it did do quite a few things right and was a enjoyable time the best part of the movie was by far the final battle. Rather then pretend that tactics are still a thing in this universe they just said fuck it and went all out Dragon Ball Z style... And it was bad-freaking-ass! One of my favourite fights in anime actually I just wish it had of gone on a little longer but ahh well what are you going to do.<br />
<br />
Naruto The Last is not one of the best anime films out there nor is it even one of the best naruto films and while it certainly doesn&#039;t try to set a new standard pulling out a lot of familiar tropes it did keep me entertained due to the surprisingly cute romance, The solid soundtrack and animation and by far the action sequences. I feel like this film would have worked better being its own arc from a writing aspect so that the villain and his motives could have been more fleshed out and the screen time characters got could have been more balanced out but as it stands while Naruto the last certainly wasn&#039;t without its flaws it had enough merits going for it to where it was able able to keep me entertained from beginning to end and sometimes thats all I really need from a movie.<br />
<br />
Naruto: The Last gets a 6.5-7.0/10<br />
<br />
Final note: Naruto&#039;s new hairstyle actually grew on me and I came to actually like his design in the film.

    Have you finished the manga ? Do you know what happened at the end of Shippuden ? If the answer for both questions is no, this movie is not for you yet. But if you really want to watch, please do. <br />
As a huge Naruto fan, excited was an understatement to express how i felt after the trailer was released back in 2014. All i can say is, this movie definitely is a beautiful closure to the long running series. <br />
<br />
CONTAIN SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
<br />
Adventure, action, romance and comedy. The story takes place few years after the end of the great ninja war. Things have changed, Kakashi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180894">
        is the new hokage, Sasuke no longer thrive to destroy Konoha, as for Hinata, she&#039;s still trying to confess to Naruto after keeping her feelings to herself all these years. Seeing Naruto&#039;s new life, I can&#039;t help but feel proud of how much he has achieved. He&#039;s no longer an outcast, but in the eyes of the villagers, he is a hero, the one who saved them from the calamity the great ninja war brought. Simply put, this whole movie tells a story of how Naruto and Hinata becomes one, Naruto becoming mature and and experiencing true love. All that happened during his mission to save Hanabi alongside Hinata. The story line is smooth, definitely better than most of the Naruto movies.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
They sure take time to perfect every little details in this movie. The scenery looks great. The changes they make to the characters are definitely for the better.  Sakura looks even more beautiful, Naruto looks so much more mature with the short haircut. Before the movie, I was expecting Naruto to look more like Minato, but he definitely look more grown up with the current hairstyle. Hinata looks ravishing as always. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
<br />
One of the things I am most excited about this movie is the character. Aside the changes they make to Naruto and Sakura, Sasuke&#039;s character development also satisfies me. Even though he&#039;s only in for a good few seconds, he looks different, with the cloak especially. The fact that he looks a lot like Madara, giving audiences the message that he&#039;s the one who&#039;s going to revive the clan, unlike Madara, he&#039;ll do something right. Kakashi as the hokage showed even more of his wise side. But i do wish they would show more of Gaara, Lee, and others. Since it&#039;s the last movie, i would love to know more about how they settle in. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
As a NaruHina fan, I truly enjoy this movie. After the Pain&#039;s arc, especially when Hinata tried to save Naruto, i was wishing for more NaruHina scenes, and I am more than glad that Naruto finally remembered everything Hinata did for him, from admiring him behind his shadow to risking her life saving her. All in this movie. The scene when he saved Hinata, flew straight to the moon and kissed her. Who would have known that Naruto could be so romantic ? <br />
<br />
The part that got me the most was the after credit scene. In the first Naruto episode, he was punished to clean the faces of the hokages carved at the rock after vandalizing them. After being asked if he wanted to go home, he said that no one was waiting for him at home anyway. Many years after, he&#039;s married, with a beautiful wife and children, living in a house right in front the hokage rock statue, and it&#039;s all because of he follows his way of ninja. <br />

    Well, this is really it huh? I mean, there&#039;s still technically that Boruto movie coming out this year, but technically speaking, this is it. The last &#039;Naruto&#039; movie. <br />
<br />
If you seen my MAL profile, you&#039;d probably noticed that I listed Naruto as one of my favorite manga of all time. Well, I&#039;m not gonna lie that the fact I grew up around the series ever since I was child is definitely play a large factor to that. Meaning that I loved it in an unexamined way fans supposed to. I definitely understand the series issue in the writing, the last arc&#039;s dragged out, the shonen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185798">
        power creep factor etc. But looking back, out of any shonen that I&#039;ve read years ago (not many admittedly, I&#039;m mostly into Jump stuff back then), this one feels closer to home for some reason.<br />
<br />
So, you can probably tell I&#039;m quite excited when I&#039;ve heard my local theater are going to run the movie. And in 15 April 2015, I have the honor of finally seeing the movie on the big screen.<br />
<br />
Talking about this movie is kinda tricky because despite the fact there&#039;s an overarching plot revolving Toneri and his plan to destroy earth, the movie largely function to bridge the gap between the end of the World War arc with the timeskip manga ending (to which I could only describe with a word &#039;wow&#039;). Or to be more precise, answering the question of how the heck Naruto and Hinata ended up together in the end. Romance is not exactly something the main Naruto series focused upon (or handled well for that matter), so when the manga ending comes around revealing each of the characters got paired of and have babies, it does ended up rather baffling for many.<br />
<br />
So yeah, the movie&#039;s kind of a romance story within the framework of a shonen battle story. But, to the movie&#039;s credit, I did liked the romance.<br />
<br />
Majority of the romantic beat is something that&#039;s familiar, but its executed well without over-reaching. Its started off with Naruto&#039;s realization of Hinata&#039;s feeling toward him as the team are stuck inside the enemies bubble trap that made them relive their memories and from there, the two of them spends time together somewhat awkwardly, before Hinata carried away by the enemy. Thus, leaving Naruto to rescue her and confront his own feeling. <br />
<br />
What&#039;s nice about it is that the romantic part paced itself naturally and conveyed through both verbal and non-verbal small interaction such as when there&#039;s a spider web stuck in Hinata&#039;s head and Naruto has to removed them (later on, she did the same thing to him) or when Naruto accidentally fell of the stairs, hurting his back and Hinata has to put the medical cream to his back (the same one she uses back at Chuunin exam arc). The way Naruto&#039;s clueless-ness and dumbfound-ness on to handle the realization of Hinata&#039;s feeling also fits his personality well. All of these event build up to pretty great romantic finale.<br />
<br />
The rest of the team are also had a purpose that ties to the plot and aren&#039;t just simply there. Sai&#039;s ink jutsu functioned as the team&#039;s transportation, Shikamaru becomes the brain as per usual, and Sakura&#039;s the one who free the team inside the memory illusion and also the one who gives Naruto the final push he needed to save Hinata and tell her how he feels. There&#039;s plenty of short appearance of popular characters, but the narrative ultimately narrowed down on the team. Making the story more focused.<br />
<br />
The problem with the movie however, lies with the overarching shonen plot. There&#039;s really no surprising twist to the story nor there&#039;s a potential thematic thread throughout. Toneri himself aren&#039;t very engaging nor complex as a villain despite the clear motivation. There&#039;s also several plot holes such as why Toneri wants Hinata to be his and why did Hinata let herself to be captured just because it was revealed she&#039;s the only one who can destroy the enemies weapon instead of just stay with the rest of the team until they finally find the weapon. Making the entire event felt contrive just so Naruto can save her. <br />
<br />
On the technical front, the movies have generally a solid aesthetic with lovely visual and several beautiful background such as Konohagakure&#039;s village detailed and lively street, and also Toneri&#039;s castle. The fight scenes are well choreographed and animated, but suffers due to the lack of weight and impact in each blows, and bland directions.<br />
<br />
So on the whole, I enjoyed Naruto the Last. Its a cute romance which unfortunately laced together with a meh shonen plot. Not exactly the finale I&#039;d wish for, but its a pretty proper send off to the series on the whole.<br />
<br />
So yeah, so long Naruto........

    Personally, I loved it.<br />
<br />
However, removing my fanaticism from my opinion, it is still beautiful in its own way.  I will say that this is a fanservice movie, emotional and not physical fanservice.<br />
<br />
One of the themes within the Naruto world is a boy maturing, finding the truths of the world (usually the hard way), and over coming obstacles, no matter what life throws at Naruto who was born a victim of circumstance and the ways of the world. By the time of the end of the series, he has grown, matured, and even become a hero to the entire shinobi world. Yet there was lesson

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191813">
        he has yet to learn, one  that many men are slow to understand: Women and Love.<br />
<br />
When the series came to its conclusion, all loose threads had been covered and taken care of (at least in a general sense), all but one, Hinata&#039;s confession all the way back in the Pain arc. Granted, with the speed of the story and how one horrible event took place after another, and the heroes racing against time to save the world, there wasn&#039;t really a good time or place for the characters to properly react to the love bomb that Hinata dropped.  So two years after the Final Great Ninja War, Naruto is suffering from limelight sunburn as a certain shy princess musters up the courage to finally approach Naruto (again).<br />
<br />
There are a lot of naysayers about the point of this &quot;Last Movie&quot;, a common complaint is that it isn&#039;t &quot;Naruto&quot;, but I dare say that it is, more so than maybe any before it.  Its the &quot;Last&quot; movie and it deserves that title because it shows how far Naruto has come, the challenges he has endured, and the &#039;man&#039; he has become because of it. <br />
<br />
My only complaint is that they should have consulted a physicist upon development of the movie, some things in anime don&#039;t work like how they&#039;re supposed to.<br />
<br />
- Oh and there&#039;s a beautifully done &quot;Red string of Fate&quot; thrown in as well.

    My Thoughts on the Last Naruto Movie<br />
<br />
I saw the The Last: Naruto the Movie on its opening day December 6th in Japanese. Surprisingly, I understood about 90% of the movie without subtitles. As a special bonus for people who saw the film on opening day, the movie theater gave everyone a free Official Movie Guide Book filled with tons of artwork for everyone&#039;s character redesign for the movie. The movie guide even has a cute little side story between Naruto and Hinata that takes place after the events of the movie. Cool. <br />
<br />
I went into the theater with the expectation that this movie would focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179495">
        more on love than action, but I never expected that it would it focus that much on love. Nevertheless, there is still action within the movie and the movie delivers its action scenes very smoothly. I like to imagine the movie as a double helix. On one strand, you have action. And on the other, romance. I&#039;ll begin by talking about the action.<br />
<br />
Do you remember that hopeless goofball from Part I of Naruto that struggled to do almost everything? Well, he&#039;s grown up. The movie takes place 2 or 3 years after the events of the manga (I forgot how many years) , Kakashi is Hokage and Naruto is the Hero of the Fourth Great Shinobi War. His hair is shorter now and he&#039;s got some new threads. This is a brand new Naruto. When the enemy&#039;s army first arrives to kidnap Hinata, Naruto springs into action--and he is magnificient. As Naruto dashes after Hinata, numerous fodder shinobi jump in his way to halt his actions. I don&#039;t think they knew who they were dealing with. Naruto has transcended to the point where he is able to destroy the fodder shinobi with simply one punch or kick without needing to break his dash. Nevertheless, a few fodder remain. As the fodder shinobi hover in the sky, Naruto charges up a single yellow, Wind Style: Rasenshuriken with one hand that acts like a guided missile and decimates them all in one of the most beautiful explosions of the series. He isn&#039;t using Sage Mode powers; he isn&#039;t using Nine Tails powers; he&#039;s using Naruto powers. I won&#039;t describe anymore action scenes besides this one, but this was perhaps the first time in the entire series I saw Naruto&#039;s resemblance to his dad. Naruto has become a genius. He&#039;s even converted me, one of the most anti-Naruto fans there were, to become his fan. This scene is actually one of the earlier scenes of the movie, but you can expect more badassery from Naruto in the following scenes as well. <br />
<br />
The romance. I have mixed feelings about Naruto&#039;s relationship with Hinata. First off, the relationship makes sense. Hinata has always been there for Naruto, even without Naruto noticing. And Naruto has always been there for Hinata, even without Naruto noticing. The movie does an absolutely beautiful job at showing the next step in the progression of the NaruHina relationship as the most natural thing in the world for both characters. Although the background characters in this Naruto movie shine far less than usual, I really want to express my content with Sakura&#039;s character in the film. Without overexerting herself, Sakura plays Cupid. She&#039;s a close female friend that can relate to Hinata&#039;s struggle of trying to be noticed by the one she loves, and does her best to help Hinata build up her confidence to confess to Naruto. And on the other side, as Naruto&#039;s best female friend, Sakura tries her best to explain the birds and the bees to Naruto; in other words, what the difference between &quot;I love ramen&quot; and &quot;I love you&quot; is. Sakura seems a lot more mature in this movie than she ever has before and I really like her character. Back to Naruto and Hinata. <br />
<br />
My major problem with the NaruHina relationship in the movie is that the strong emphasis on love takes the series in a new direction that I don&#039;t exactly like--it&#039;s as if the series is no longer Naruto. I liked most of the romantic undertones in the series prior to the movie because they were just that--undertones. The series was not about love. Simply, the romantic undertones provided a quick joke or added a little drama here or there. Admittedly, the strong love interest by Hinata and Sakura were used at times to drive the plot of the series, but those feelings never took away from the action of the series. My other issue with the pairing is not necessarily an issue, just a comment really. Having pairings in the Naruto universe realized is just a weird feeling. Because the show was never about pairings, it always seemed to me that pairings were invited by fans, and used by fans to argue amongst themselves. It&#039;s just weird to me having certain pairings becoming canon. <br />
<br />
All in all, this was a fantastic movie. It kind of feels like a Hollywood blockbuster; I can totally see this movie being done with real life actors. I recommend the movie to ALL fans of the Naruto series. Because the movie takes place after the manga, this is the real end to the series. Seeing Naruto blown up on the big screen was an absolutely amazing experience. <br />
<br />
I give the movie 4/5 stars.<br />
<br />
P.S. If I really have to think about it, I guess I was more of a NaruSaku fan than a NaruHina fan, so I guess I&#039;m a little bitter at that XD

The story is complete and utter trash.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS FOR SHIPPUDEN FINALE AND THIS MOVIE.<br />
<br />
The Naruto series has never been particularly well written with regards to romance. The Naruto-Hinata love story was already stretched so thin across the series, here we see it stretched even further as an excude to draw audiences into this lazy attempt at a movie.<br />
<br />
If it wasn&#039;t for the love subplot resolution there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie, and even with that subplot resolution I still wouldn&#039;t really recommend this movie.<br />
<br />
The whole movie stinks of filler material. A villain is pulled out of thin air and given powers which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365731">
        don&#039;t scale to the rest of the Naruto universe; by all reasoning this villain should be significantly weaker than Kaguya whom Naruto has already beaten but for plot armour reasons the villain is a struggle.<br />
<br />
To help build up tension they even retroactively pull a giant chakra laser canon out of thin air and put it one an arbitrary time limit after which it will kill off the entire main cast, spectacularly lazy writing.<br />
<br />
Hinata is repeatedly reduced to a thin damsel-in-distress, culminating in being locked in a literal bird cage to watch on helplessly as Naruto fights to save her. Hinata has so little agency in the film it would be laughable if it wasn&#039;t so sad.<br />
<br />
We even get a forced and unnecessary Sasuke appearance, are the writers even trying?<br />
<br />
This film is held up by its sad attempt at a romance resolution and the pretty art direction.<br />
The scale feels forced, like they are trying to create a spectacle and scale to compete with the Shippuden ending.<br />
<br />
Story: hahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha, no.<br />
<br />
Art: Pretty, well drawn, although at times the scale feels a bit forced.<br />
<br />
Sound: Nothing particularly memorable, but maybe I missed a hidden gem.<br />
<br />
Characters: Reduced to thin shadows of their former selves.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: ... a let down.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Giving this a numeric rating was hard.<br />
I was going to go with 4 but the description for that is &quot;decent&quot; which is too high a praise.<br />
3 is &quot;poor&quot; which is getting closer.<br />
2 is &quot;dreadful&quot;.<br />
Somewhere between 2 and 3 seems about right.<br />
Actually, they messed up the romance resolution arch, showing the wedding largely monocoloured and in the background during the credits.<br />
Dreadful it is, 2.<br />
<br />

    So, I saw this movie on Internet and it was in pretty bad quality so I maybe missed some small details. The movie starts with epic prologue, it&#039;s styled in black and white and look very artistic, so I really like that part it was epic as hell. Now onto the bad aspect to the movie Villain, plot and attempt to make money from Sasuke&#039;s appearance. Let me tell you, if you are Sasuke fan and would watch it only for Sasuke don&#039;t even bother to watch it, he will literally get less then 2 minutes in the movie. Villain is okay, but nothing unusual,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183898">
        rather boring. The plot is also okay, but again; nothing unusual. Animation and sound is beyond solid, I was surprised that Studio Pierrot really made and effort in this. (Unlike Pain fight in Shippuden) Now into romantic aspect; this movie convinced me that Studio Pierrot would be WAY better at making romance series. Romance was handled very nicely, it really was able to make you emotional and be more connected with character. For example: Sakura; she is number one on my hate list. But in this movie she was really decent and beautiful character (Unlike part 1 and Shippuden). So it really surprised me in a very good way.<br />
<br />
The gold part for me was NaruHina moments. I have been their shipper since I was little and was like little child when I saw them.<br />
<br />
Overall, definitely best Naruto movie in the franchise. With amazing artwork and sound, the plot and villain was okay, but still not anything special. Also if you are Sasuke or NaruSaku fan don&#039;t watch it, it would be waste of time for you.

    The movie takes place after everything has been resolved and Naruto is seen as the Hero who saved everybody. While it was nice watching Naruto finally being acknowledged by everybody that&#039;s about where my enjoyment ended. <br />
<br />
The villain of the movie is a one dimensional character who wants to destroy Earth by moving the Moon closer to it. He consideres Hinata as the byakugan princess and wants to marry her because, reasons? He kidnappes Hanabi for her eyes and now Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, Sai and Shikamaru have to go and save her while also stopping the moon from crashing into Earth. <br />
<br />
If you were expecting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344209">
        an amazing fight, think again because the main plot is Naruto figuring out his love for Hinata. While this in itself would have been an interesting story it was executed horribly. Through out the entire movie Hinata is nothing more than a damsel in dsitress. There&#039;s even a moment in the beginning where Hinata is dangeling from a wall and Naruto needs to save her from falling EVEN THOUGH NINJAS CAN WALK ON WALLS. Honestly Hinata deserves better. She has proven herself to be an incredibly strong character yet in this movie she&#039;s nothing more than an accessory. Throughout the entire show Hinata is this delicate little pretty thing to look at that needs saving from the big bad man who&#039;s keeping her hostage. I&#039;m honestly offended at how much they wanted the typical romance tropes that they decided that they should just nerf Hinata. <br />
<br />
While the animation is good, being newer and all, The fights honestly felt lacking. The punches didn&#039;t carry any weight behind them making everything almost have this floaty feeling to it. The smaller fights were actually pleasing to watch while the main fight was over much too soon and lacked any sort of impact.<br />
<br />
The Sound design was mediocre at best. There wasn&#039;t really anything that stood out. They tried using the typical Naruto fight music during the main fight but the fight was so mediocre the theme actually felt out of place. <br />
<br />
Overall the movie was honestly pretty boring. The slow pacing halfway through and the lack of urgency to save Hanabi made the movie feel like it would drag on forever. Even when the movie finally picked up with the fight it just abruptly cuts off and skips foward to everybody being saved with absolutely no explanation. The ending is also the most cliche cringy romance garbage that makes the cheesiest of shoujo look good. Don&#039;t believe me? How does Naruto Holding Hinata bridal style while he uses a rasengan to propell them upwards while he spouts romantic nonsense sound. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re expecting a typical Naruto movie don&#039;t watch this. If you&#039;re expecting a nice romance between Naruto and Hinata, still don&#039;t watch this. <br />
<br />

    Beware, spoilers ahead; for some reason if you still want to watch this movie.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t believe Kishimoto actually green lit this movie and called it &#039;canon&#039;... even though it&#039;s bad even by filler standards. It&#039;s got so many asspulls and plotholes, like Naruto being able to use the Kagebunshin Jutsu when he was like 5 years old, Hinata fucking sitting on her ass knitting when her sister was kidnapped,  Naruto falling in a GENJUTSU when it&#039;s confirmed that Jinchuriki CANNOT get caught it one! <br />
<br />
They literally had to make him defy the rules the series had built upon to get him to acknowledge her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349310">
        existence. <br />
<br />
And apparently Naruto can&#039;t differentiate between love for a person and love for food... What the fuck? Last I checked, HE was the one who told Zabuza Haku&#039;s love for him as his father figure. He was the one who understood what pain Sasuke went through after losing his family! He was the one who could tell Sakura was lying to herself when she said she didn&#039;t love Sasuke anymore! He understood the importance of love because he never had anyone to love him! <br />
<br />
Studio Filler made him look like a dumbass because they somehow needed to justify Naruto completely ignoring Hinata&#039;s love confession, lmao.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also the fact that they used Sasuke&#039;s appearence in the trailer to get fans exited while he gets like, 1 minute of screentime in this already awful movie, this was huge disappointment; and if that wasn&#039;t enough, this movie was basically a romance for a never-would-happen-couple except for that one fight scene with Toneri.<br />
<br />
Just remember the fact that Boruto Uzumaki exists because of this movie.

    My review of The Last : Naruto the Movie is going to be cut in two lists : The good and The bad.<br />
Because i like lists, shut up.<br />
<br />
There is some minor spoiler about what happen in this movie. Not too much.. but they are some..<br />
<br />
<br />
The good : <br />
The cameo of the kages. I love the kages. They are awesome. It was a small cameo but a good one and justified. <br />
The story was good. Honestly. A story with Sakura would be better (sorry) but if i&#039;m objective, I can&#039;t deny that.<br />
Sasuke&#039;s apparition.<br />
Naruto and Hinata&#039;s technique was cool.<br />
The bad guy. He was awesome ! His powers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194203">
        was awesome and at the beginning we don&#039;t know who is he, why he wants to marry Hinata and what are his intentions or his powers and I like that.<br />
Naruto and Hinata&#039;s kiss.. Yes i don&#039;t like that it was with Hinata but it was well orchestrated so.. <br />
<br />
The bad :<br />
<br />
Naruto didn&#039;t remember a thing about Hinata. <br />
I don&#039;t like how they interact between each other.. She&#039;s kind.. but really too kind. So..empty.. They doesn&#039;t share that much and that why their &quot;love story&quot; sounds fake to me..<br />
Why they have to leave Hinata with Naruto all the time ? Come on .. It&#039;s not like everybody knew that they need time together to be a couple. If it was true, why Kishi didn&#039;t do this during the manga Naruto<br />
They don&#039;t have a real connection. I admit that they&#039;re cute together but she&#039;s not a strong woman as Sakura i&#039;m sorry. And if Kishi really want to make a NaruHina couple, he started that after the Pain Arc.. Which he didn&#039;t.. But he did a crappy job at confuse the issue so..<br />
Naruto didn&#039;t use Kurama&#039;s full power. Why ? You moron ! You beat The Mother of Chakra but you can&#039;t beat a single guy like him ? ..Are you kidding me ? (I know that it&#039;s a movie, shut up)<br />
Remember all those years when Naruto loved Sakura ? Well Naruto doesn&#039;t. Because he doesn&#039;t have a single feeling for her now. Don&#039;t ask me why. And don&#039;t think that this movie will tell you why.<br />
I really don&#039;t understand how they manages to takes eyes so easily in this manga .. <br />
The confession of Naruto to Hinata. Too fast. Too.. Unreal.. Not lovely at all.. It looks like he doesn&#039;t want to. It&#039;s like he thought : &quot;Ok.. let&#039;s tell her that I love her. After all, she loved me so much during all those years .. I be rude if I&#039;m not give my love back&quot; Love is not like that. <br />
Did they really say that Naruto confess to Sakura only because he didn&#039;t want to loses against Sasuke ? Really guys, REALLY ?? <br />
Sakura who says that &quot;Love can&#039;t be forget so easily&quot; .. Sasuke tries to KILL YOU, you stupid thing !<br />
Hinata is a strong woman.. but only during fight.. Sakura is strong in even outside the fighting and that&#039;s what a woman should be like ! You crazy people. <br />
Why are you destroying so many time this scarf .. are you out of you mind ? I guess that they want to tell that the scarf can be broke but not their love but come on.. it&#039;s a scarf.. And a cool one !<br />
Kakashi. Is he really the Hokage ? He&#039;s so WEAK !<br />
What&#039;s under Naruto&#039;s bandages, goddammit ? Is that a bionic arm ? Or an arm full of sharigans ? <br />
Hinata&#039;s weeding dress is kind of morbid..<br />
The Raikage is an asshole. He wanted to kill Naruto who saves the world without a single hesitation. That&#039;s so mean ! How can&#039;t you trust him to save the world one more time ? <br />
The end of Toneri&#039;s battle. Too fast !! Damn you, movie length ! <br />
Did the scarf was back again by ITSELF at the end ? Nobody ? Nothing ?<br />
Why is this the last movie of &quot;Naruto&quot;? It makes me so sad.. I don&#039;t care about Bolt. My hero was Naruto ! Don&#039;t go !! Or maybe go.. I will never have the same feeling about a Naruto movie stronger that the very first movie with the princess of the land of snow.. <br />
The ending song.. So good.. Makes me cry... Just a little, shut up !<br />
The little picture of Neji with everybody during the ending credits. Yes, I also cry about that, shut up ! <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s it, I guess. I only hope they will give us a sneak peak of the life of Naruto and Hinata in the Bolt Movie even if I&#039;m still not fond of their couple.. <br />
And if they going to make now a movie about Sasuke and Sakura ? I will definitely not going to see it.. Or maybe I will.. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like you, Kishi.. I don&#039;t like this final movie of Naruto. I don&#039;t like this couple.. AT ALL.<br />
But thank you for all those years and all those.. well.. average movie.. Except this one.. Kind of..<br />
<br />
See you around.

    well well Naruto the Last movie, Honestly I live in europe so I couldn&#039;t see the movie but instead watched it online with bad Quality, so that might have affected my Judgement in this film.<br />
<br />
The story<br />
Naruto the Last did things Different in this movie by being more of a Romantic love story then the show did.<br />
the Story is good but also bad.<br />
The bad part is the safe the world part, that is kinda cliché and kinda done already. and it is also pretty Predictable.<br />
it was more like this safe the world thing was needed for the Romance to happen and the story also suffered from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179522">
        the Fact that the main Villain is not that good.<br />
<br />
Now the Good part: The romantic story is very Sweet and the Movie self is paced very well :) When i started watching Naruto (one year ago) I was rooting for NaruHina (the belief that Naruto and hinata would be a couple), so you ppl might now how I think of them.<br />
score for the entire movie: 6<br />
the score for the love story: 8<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
the animators did a very good job there.<br />
it still has the Naruto style but also added good CGI to it and the Lazy moments were not there at all, heck there were 2 moments where i just looked at the screen with my mouth open of enjoyment, these 2 moments were the Final battle where they just Fight without using Exposition and pays homage to previous battles that Naruto fought, and the O so Beautifull kiss scene where Naruto and Hinata were running and jumping from sphere to sphere while other spheres that surrounded Naruto and Hinata Showed Memories of them together and then they launched themselves up so that they could kiss each other in the moonlight.<br />
score: 8<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound Accompanied the Art and story very good. the orchestrated music which is also of the Main show really fitted in every scene of the movie especially in the end.<br />
the Voice actors did also a very good job. Granted they are still the main voices that the Characters already had, they sounded like they have Matured, Especially Sakura sounded Mature and that is veryy good.<br />
score: 9<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
well the Movie Mainly Focused on Naruto and Hinata, and them together was very nicely done.<br />
Ofcourse the main main Characters where Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, Shikamaru and Sai and all of them were very likeable and usefull:<br />
Sakura was very nice in this movie, Helping them team alot and playing Matchmaker between Naruto and Hinata<br />
Shikamaru was as always a good smart ass and gave good advice and Sai.... well he tries to be funny and had some good moments to<br />
<br />
then the problem: since Naruto has alot of Characters, alot of them got Brutally Sidelined to Just Showing their face, that even Happened to Sasuke who was only there for like 2 minutes while he Is One of the main Characters of Naruto.<br />
then we have Toneri: he is a Boring Character and the very Cliché Misguided Villain.<br />
he was not interesting at all<br />
<br />
in Overall I realy like Naruto and this Movie is Naruto it still has the flaws that Naruto has but then better Animated and better orchestrated.<br />
the thing that may make you Dislike the movie is what it did to the Characters, some want to see more Rock Lee, others wanted that NaruSaku Happened instead of NaruHina and others(including me) wanted more Sasuke and a better Villain.<br />
<br />
so if you like Naruto then you will like this movie to but if you hate it then you might hate it to<br />
I liked watching this movie and i reccomend you watch it, even though it is not By far one of the best.<br />
Overall score: a 7,5 and maybe a 8 if I can find a vid of this movie that has better Quality<br />
<br />
ow and one last thing: NaruHina is one of my OTP&#039;s
