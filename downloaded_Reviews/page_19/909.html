    Life Lessons with Uramichi Oniisan (UO) tells you a story about how one life must always go on, despite all those depressing circumstances of living a poor, sad, and lonely life in this accursed society. As someone who has been struggling with crippling depression for years, I really couldn&#039;t agree more with this miserable truth. <br />
<br />
And it is such a breath of fresh air to see how UO is a story that always does as it pleases to depict the miserable life of a grown-up adult when life truly isn&#039;t all about sunshine, and watching UO may help you to realize this sooner rather than later.

        In life lessons with Uramichi Oniisan, or UO for short, we will follow the never-ending tales of Uramichi&#039;s depressing life. As someone who has experienced the grim reality of adulthood firsthand, Uramichi is your lovely and caring older brother who will always be there to share his fair share of pain and the sad reality with the sweet, lovely innocent kids.<br />
<br />
As a show that is full of its original drives, UO is a show that is filled with unexpected moments and dark humor when it comes to sad and depressing jokes for adults. Although UO can be a bit too much for some people with its hell-bent sarcastic fest, it is a show that will never shy away from its basic idea of mocking the lives of pathetic grown-ups. Most often than not, you might have a good laugh at some of UO&#039;s absurd moments that you simply can&#039;t help but laugh at, but there is just so much truth to be seen and realized when it comes to UO double-meaning jokes. It is full of deep meaning that can be understood simply by context, which is an impressive feat in all its worth. <br />
<br />
The show is also bold enough to come up with its own unique way of tackling the never-ending depression that has been plaguing our society for who knows how long. Take Uramichi&#039;s case, for example. It is almost an everyday occurrence for him to go to work, even when his mental health has taken a turn for the worse. It is the sad reality of one life where the adult doesn&#039;t even question it anymore as if that was supposed to be normal. And it just got more ugly with the daily sessions of questioning Uramichi&#039;s life worth in front of all those kids. I wouldn&#039;t call that funny, but the story does get the buildup it deserved as the series progressed. It is reassuring enough to see that there is a different side of the cast that we haven&#039;t truly seen and how well they fare in the face of life difficulties. And it is slowly getting better, even if it wasn&#039;t much for all of them. <br />
<br />
Although it wasn&#039;t that surprising to see that dark humor isn&#039;t just for everyone, as it can be more offensive and sensitive than an insult itself. But in UO&#039;s case, the show managed to turn the tables in a hilarious yet engaging way of comedy that never falls short of provoking one dilemma in life after another. The show, in its entirety, manages to present itself with a brand of humor that can be relatable to every single adult out there, given how often it is to have a bad day in your life. And sometimes, it is much better to simply laugh it off when things don&#039;t go your way. At this point, UO successfully highlighted the absurdities of how one life can be with its special cast of characters. Surprisingly, it can be quite fun to see how every single cast member in the show is just as cynical as Uramichi when it comes to their daily lives. As they never managed to achieve their dream of happiness, each of the cast has more than one reason for being unhappy in life. And it really can&#039;t get any worse to see how depressed and lifeless their eyes appear to be in those weird-looking ass costumes at work. But perhaps these are the most important life lessons for all those poor, innocent children about what adulthood should be like. And wearing those sunflower and bug costumes while being forced to sing a happy kid song is just putting the cherry on top of what miserable life is. <br />
<br />
Even so, understanding UO jokes and cynicism may prove to be more difficult and demanding than understanding others in the same genre. Mostly because it makes us laugh at one misfortune after another. And not everyone can accept it wholeheartedly as a sense of humor since some of UO moments themselves weren&#039;t even considered funny from the beginning. You might as well notice that some of its slapstick comedy and flat-out jokes are dry instead of being funny. And the jokes themselves do get repetitive and old very fast along the way. Yet I&#039;m more than pleased to say that at least the show was still intriguing and interesting enough to hook a lot of fans in no time. With the right mix of humor and experience in adulthood, UO manages to mesh all those absurdities and moments altogether into one spectacular show that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults alike.

    Simply magnificent, a raw comedy in all its splendor, do not be fooled by the happy and funny colors of the protagonists.<br />
<br />
Also a crude satire, towards the work that some people do, in the middle of the entertainment, where you only see the happy face and not the expressions that will be cut in post production.<br />
<br />
Each character that is presented has a charismatic side (the only one shown on TV in the program) and their real or adult side.<br />
<br />
Starting with the protagonist Uramichi, a happy face in all its splendor but it is nothing more than a lie, addicted to weights and muscles as Tobikichi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410096">
        says<br />
<br />
Iketeru is the typical old guy who likes those dirty jokes that talk about the &quot;penis&quot; with terms like &quot;sausage, worm. Etc&quot; the seiyu&#039;s laugh is so splendid that now I consider it my favorite, humor chelo, whatha am I a guy green?<br />
<br />
Utano is the thirty-year-old and female cast of the television program, an obese person with marrying one day, she encourages her companions in a strange way but she liked it<br />
<br />
Then Usao-kun, Usahara disguised as a pink rabbit, always speaking ill of Uramichi saying things like &quot;the only thing you can do is weights&quot; is a comic relief and an idiot at the same time.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kumao-kun, Kumatani disguised as a brown bear, is undoubtedly the mature and &quot;unknown&quot; air of the 4, having a great pairing in his personality with Jun Satou from Working!

    &quot;Hai Domo, kids! Let&#039;s all come together and do a charismatimgly cute children&#039;s show to the audience! A--B--C, A--B--C, A..to...Z!&quot; <br />
*switches off the TV* So that&#039;s your real shell of a dark personality huh?<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan can just be summed up in these one-word caricatures: (simply *chef&#039;s kiss*) amazing, comical, wholesome (if you understood the show&#039;s intents), magnifiquely magnificent (all-around). It&#039;s &quot;Expectations vs. Reality&quot; in the most dark, crude stance of a satirical parody, or as I like to call it in a better light: &quot;Adulting/Adulthood&quot; the Animation. It&#039;s OK because the &quot;OK Boomers&quot; young generation will absolutely not understand how #Relatable this show is to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418668">
        young adults in their late 20s or adults in their early 30s (of which I am one, hands up if you belong to the Millennial generation) who have gone through this stage of handling jobs and juggling life at the same time, and now passing this knowledge down to children. How depressing can your life be when you&#039;ve reached the point of no return?<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan tells the story of 31-year old Uramichi Omota, a lively and bubbly adult imitating the parody of Okaasan to Issho, a children&#039;s television program on Japan&#039;s largest TV network NHK (that&#039;s the children&#039;s arm of NHK Educational TV for ya), dubbed &quot;Together with Maman&quot; on MHK, also a gymnastics show for children. In truth, he is the same 31-year-old guy who was a former gymnast with a really good smile and physique, but with a caveat: he is mentally unstable. He can get away with his upbeat personality on camera, but off-camera, his life is reduced to an old man&#039;s activity of some heavy smoking and drinking while doing his muscle training hobby at times. But if there&#039;s one thing that you do not want to do: point the facts out, or Uramichi Oniisan will bite the hell out of you with his culminating depression. That&#039;s a life lesson to be taught.<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan is not alone though, he has helpers performing alongside him, and display the same fervor of lifelessness that&#039;s simiarly identical or less worse than what Uramichi is going through: his juniors of Tobikichi Usahara and Mitsuo Kumatani, both 28-years old and are once Uramichi&#039;s juniors in college, and formerly music actors 27-year old Iketeru Daga and and 32-year old Utano Tadano. What I love about their names is that mangaka Gaku Kuze has a legit reason why he has given these very memorable and likable characters names as such. See the simiarlities: Uramichi full name implies a double-faced personality (inner and outer side), Tobikichi plays the rabbit mascot &quot;Usao&quot; while Mitsuo plays the bear mascot &quot;Kumao&quot;, and get this: Iketeru&#039;s full name is a pun meaning &quot;But I&#039;m handsome&quot; while Utano&#039;s means &quot;Just a singer&quot;. There&#039;s more though: &quot;Together with Maman&quot;&#039;s director Tekito Derekida meaning careless director, Furitsuke Capellini meaning a literate capellini (pasta)-haired choreographer, to name a few. What insane creativity is this!?<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan has a caveat that strikes the &quot;Home Run&quot; effect of being very likeable: the stacked VA character cast that accompanies the entire character cast in their conquest to become the most boring, unequivocal, yet realistic human beings that we&#039;ve come to love. Hiroshi Kamiya for Uramichi, Tomokazu Sugita for Usahara, Yuuichi Nakamura for Kumatani, Miyano Mamoru for Iketeru, Nana Mizuki for Utano, the list goes on and on. It&#039;s just pure undulated, unfiltered, uncensored dark comedic vibes for the realism of knowing what&#039;s in the minds of adults, and how like Uramichi, can slowly burst his misery to the children who has to bear the heavy burdens from an adult teaching them mature life values while on-set. The on-set children under the Oniisans and Utano Oneesan though, I love the children who can just ask them hard questions taught from their parents, and to slowly see the creeps befall their faces, drooping down in quietness, trying their best to not be coercive to the children who still have a long life to go. Also, this show always defaults on its running gags, which can be tiresome on repeat, but IMO it&#039;s a blast to see such &quot;atrocities&quot; ensue. For example, Tobikichi always bad-mouths Uramichi to the point of sheer terror if exposed; Iketeru always shudders in laughter when he hears &quot;dick jokes&quot;, always thinks of rice balls and is unable to read analog watches; and Utano&#039;s the saddest of all: she&#039;s an idol job hopper-cum-singer, and has a boyfriend of 6 years whom is unpopular. Yikes, talk about a hundred feet drop there.<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan&#039;s production values aren&#039;t really the best, but if all it does is to adapt Gaku Kuze&#039;s manga content to a T (which it did), then I&#039;m more than happy enough. For reference, the manga&#039;s visuals are quite simple with not a lot of attention to detail (well, just a teeny bit), so getting a low budget studio such as Studio Blanc is of no difficult manner. A fun fact that this marks the first individual-produced show for the studio in over 10 years (while 2011&#039;s Ro-Kyu-Bu! and 2017&#039;s Shobitch are co-animated shows, plus some OVAs rounding up its miniscule works list). There&#039;s not a whole lot to say about the dull visuals because it&#039;s just that to translate the manga onto the small screen as decent as it could be, but it&#039;s viable enough. The music though I must say is an acquired taste, but a well-rounded set with the duet of the singer actors Iketeru Oniisan (Mamoru Miyano) and Utano Oneesan (Nana Mizuki) for the OP, and Mamoru Miyano for the ED. The clicking kids and adult contrast vibes are there, and I absolutely love it.<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan, it pains me to see that this show is not as popular in the mainstream, but that&#039;s OK because this show fits to a certain demographic of people who can vibe what the anime is all about, me included. This is just pure abject, hilarious parodied creativity of levels I&#039;ve honestly never seen before in anime, and in such a low-key series as Uramichi Oniisan, I&#039;m very dumbfounded as to how this series manages to lay low under the radar to become one of my guilty favourites of the Summer season. It&#039;s been long since I&#039;ve had my share of pure, unadulterated laughter (after last season&#039;s &quot;Dragon, Ie wo Kau.&quot;), and more people should give this a chance (especially to the Millennials), you&#039;re truly missing out on a modern cult-following show that is a comedic, heart and gut-wrenching suckerpunch to your eternalistic reality.

    I first came across Uramichi Oniisan last year, when I saw a PV for it being made. I&#039;m pretty certain that it&#039;s anime release was delayed due to the pandemic, but personally I think it was a rather good thing for this show as a lot more people raved about it.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, I&#039;d like to mention that I&#039;ve read the manga before watching the anime, so half of my review will most likely be based on how I percieve the anime in comparison to its manga counterpart.<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan has a certain appeal that could seem dark to some - it plays with common tropes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410082">
        people experience in their daily lives, yet exaggerates them for comedic effect. Personally, I love the dark humour, sarcasm and all the ranchy jokes this series has to offer. I know for a few people it may be too exaggerated to the point of being simply annoying, or just &quot;trying to hard to be funny&quot;, but, I&#039;d beg to argue that Uramichi Oniisan does a very good job of meeting the balance between seriousness and humour.<br />
<br />
The different characters in the show are quite diverse and all seem to interact with the titular character in various ways. I&#039;d also like to mention and emphasize that I believe the voice actors chosen for this series was very well done as these actors certainly understood the assignment and knew how to portray their roles.<br />
<br />
For instance, Hiroshi Kamiya (most famously known for being Levi in AOT), plays Uramichi and honestly I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way. He&#039;s able to capture the depressed tones of Uramichi perfectly, yet also emphasize Uramichi&#039;s sincerity when it comes to certain characters. And I cannot stress this enough, but the character Uramichi is probably one of the most well-written characters I&#039;ve seen in anime (although some may beg to differ). I love how he realistically presents negative views on the life of a working adult and how it&#039;s not all sunshine and rainbows - his minor fourth wall breaks are excellent and definitely keep the viewer captivated.<br />
<br />
Other than Uramichi, I&#039;d also like to touch upon my personal favourite character - Daga Iketeru. I will admit that I first only liked him because he was a pretty boy, but once seeing his character unveil in the story, it was quite interesting to see how he&#039;s portrayed to be a child living in an adult&#039;s body. He&#039;s quite unaware of himself and his abilities but at the same time I like the mystery surrounding his character. Also I&#039;d like to mention how Miyano was the perfect person to play this character, namely because of how authentic he comes across. I&#039;m definitely looking to see more of his character in future episodes.<br />
<br />
Music and sound in general plays actually quite a big part in the show. I never really expected how it would impact my enjoyment as a manga reader, but once getting around to watching the anime, it is definitely clear that the creators knew what they were doing.<br />
<br />
If we were to go by the ending song and opening song only, I&#039;d say that they&#039;re both perfect fits for this show. The ending song sung by Miyano, has become quite a hit as of current and I also really enjoy it. I like how it contains calmer and more &#039;adult&#039; vibes, as if representing the end of a long day at work and overall nostalgia. I think Mamoru Miyano definitely did so well on this track, and I&#039;m pretty certain a lot of fans enjoy it because of its &#039;kpop sounding feel&#039;. The opening song is quite upbeat and what I&#039;d imagine the theme song of Together with Mama to be, I liked the images portrayed in it as it made it quite cute and overall just portrays the anime to be your general slice-of-life comedy type show. The background music and it&#039;s overall build up and slight changes in tone honestly just adds to the comedic effect as well as setting the scene, making it a necessity that not one would think of at first glance.<br />
<br />
My review may be a bit biased, but I just want to put it out there that Uramichi Oniisan as an anime was done quite well! The overall flow of the anime is reminiscent to how the manga flows with it&#039;s short cut offs, but I believe it just adds to the charm of the show. And honestly, the show is literally just comedic genius with just the right amount of fourth wall breaks and seriousness to keep that mysterious allure about it. So if you&#039;re hesitating to watch this show, I hope I&#039;ve convinced you to forget about your worries and just watch it!

    &quot;A Beautiful Day in Uramichi’s Neighborhood&quot;<br />
<br />
&#039;&#039;Adult life is already so outlandish. Now you just sit back and enjoy an anime that makes fun of the outlandish.&#039;&#039; <br />

Dark humor is hard to get right sometimes. It can often be misconstrued and become edgy or downright offensive, focused on punching down at certain groups instead of at difficult topics. When it’s done right, though, you get hilarious and thought provoking comedy, and that’s exactly what Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan is. It’s a comedy that focuses on the struggles and absurdities of adult life as experienced by Uramichi, someone who is not only wrestling with the pressures of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418686">
        society, but also his mental health. The anime has a brand of humor that will definitely resonate with adults, both newly minted and veteran, and remind them that sometimes you just have to laugh about the sucky things in life. <br />
<br />
One can imagine how hard it is to be a children’s entertainer. They have to keep a happy personality almost all of the time, to the point where their TV persona overtakes their real-life one. But what happens if their true self starts to crack open from behind the facade? And what if the cameras are rolling when it happens? Life Lessons with Uramichi Oniisan showcases such a dilemma with gut-punch of relatability, while at the same time delivering a nonstop tickling of side-aching laughs.<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
<br />
Based on the manga by Gaku Kuze, the series follows the titular character (Hiroshi Kamiya), who serves as the exercise segment leader of the children’s show Together with Maman. At first, he looks super happy to be teaching these kids about being in good health. However, as the recordings go on, his mentally unstable self peers through, to the silent shock of the children in the student. Yet despite his often depressing outlook on life, Uramichi continues to be a popular personality for kids and adults.<br />
<br />
But why is it a good watch for anyone, including non-anime fans? <br />
<br />
Firstly, it’s quite episodic compared to most anime. While there is a general plot line of Uramichi growing emotionally, the comedy of it can be enjoyed from any episode without having seen the entire show. Whether you come in at Iketeru’s obsession with Richard Feynman or Uramichi’s ridiculous costumes, you’ll be able to laugh along. It’s a very similar structure to most sitcoms, which makes it an easy transition for people who may be new to anime and looking for a good gateway to the medium. <br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
<br />
Uramichi The Broken-<br />
<br />
Much like many other adults, Uramichi is a man who’s been beaten down by society as his ambitions, hopes, and dreams have seemingly been stripped away from him. He goes from being a celebrated gymnast to living his now unsatisfying life stuck parading for children’s television. His dissatisfaction is made very blatant in the anime as he frequently pushes his unhappiness down the throats of the very same children he’s meant to be a role model to.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Uramichi isn’t the only one suffering on Together with Maman. The singing duo of Iketeru (Mamoru Miyano) and Utano (Nana Mizuki) have their own share of issues, with the former having too much of a childlike mentality and the latter having trouble with her singing career and live-in boyfriend. Then there are the animal mascot duo of Usahara (Tomokazu Sugita) and Kumatani (Yuichi Nakamura), both of whom have trouble keeping their mouths shut at the worst exact time. All of them soldier through the recording of the children’s show, and deal with some of the worst behind-the-scenes shenanigans anyone can imagine.<br />
<br />
[Laughing at Misfortune]<br />
<br />
At first, the cringe-worthy stuff is merely the things that come out of Uramichi’s mouth. His true depressed self seeps through at the absolute worst times, as he teaches the kids certain adult things that the little ones have no business knowing. Of course, sometimes the kids are the ones who set him off with their questions, such as “How come you don’t have kids yet?”, “What’s harassment mean?”, and “What was the relationship with your Dad like?” And the cameras keep on rolling, as everything is put to tape and aired days later.<br />
<br />
But then, the horror shows begin, and the main culprit of it is the Together with Maman director Derekida (Kenyu Horiuchi). His demands for flashy entrances, last-minute in-person events, and even weekend “getaways” show just how grueling it is to work on a children’s television programs. The most painfully funny moments are when he has the cast record a summer video in the winter and, well, you can only guess what he makes Uramichi and the gang do in the summer! Yet despite the two similar story lines, Life Lessons with Uramichi Oniisan manages to churn out new jokes, punchlines, and visual gags that’ll take any viewer by surprise.<br />
<br />
When the show goes down relatable paths, that’s when viewers will find themselves laughing while trying not to cry as they look into the mirror. It’s obvious that no one on Together with Maman wants to be there. Uramichi merely wants to weight train; Utano wants a successful music career; Iketeru yearns to be in stage musicals; even the duo of Usahara and Kumatani want something better in life, especially away from Uramichi’s toxic personality. And yet, they all have to march on through every recording with a fake smile, just like every person in the world who’s forced to work someplace they despise! Moments like this will make anyone groan with relatability, albeit with a chuckle in the belly mixed with said emotional pains.<br />
<br />
[Sound]<br />
<br />
The humor hits hard thanks in part to its perfect cast. You cannot ask for a better person to play a depressed children’s TV show host than Kamiya, who delivers his lines with both pure joy and sadness. Mizuki uses her talents as a J-POP singer to bring out Utano’s passion for performing in both heartfelt and hilariously soul-crushing ways. Sugita’s Usahara knows how to sound like he’s in physical pain with such comedic perfection, with Nakamura’s Kumatani adding some backbone to the stage crew thanks to his tone and backstage attitude. As Iketeru, Miyano showcases a cute childlike attitude that sometimes bring to mind Steve Carell’s Anchorman character Brick Tamland.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Miyano, he and Mizuki steal the show with the songs they perform on Together with Maman. They at first seem kid-friendly, only for them to take a sharp left turn towards existential crises. They may sound cute, but their lyrics will no doubt deliver a jab to one’s spirit the more the songs continue onward.<br />
<br />
[Animatiion]<br />
<br />
Studio Blanc brings the anime to life with the right amount of love and care. There are moments where character movement can be slightly stiff, especially when not much is happening in the scene. However, their facial expression game is on-point, amplifying the frustration these characters are going through.<br />
 <br />
[TL;DR]<br />
[Final Thoughts]<br />
<br />
Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan has things that can resonate with every viewer. It’s funny, deliciously dark at times, and has just a dash of hope that combines to make a fantastic comedy series that even those unacquainted with anime can enjoy. The jokes &amp; visual gags are hilarious, and its execution is flawless thanks to its phenomenal cast. Life Lessons with Uramichi Oniisan delivers some of the sharpest television production-based satire seen in its medium. This anime covers subjects you typically don’t see much in anime or at least subjects that are usually not the main focus. The anime answers the question of what would happen if you put a broken, emotionally unstable, formerly ambitious person in the spotlight. The result of which so far is a bit intriguing, not in an exploitative way per se, but rather in an educative way.<br />

    Uramichi Onii-san is a very comedic anime with a HEAVY take on adulthood and life in general. What I expect to be a light hearted anime with some dark jokes here and there, turned out to be an anime that gave life lessons on how to try and handel your life. An anime that contains a genuinely great advice on how to try and help yourself even during the darkest times in your life. Let&#039;s talk about how great Uramichi Onii-san is. <br />
<br />
<br />
Uramichi Onii-san is a story about 5 characters. A singer that lost her stardom. An introvertwith a heart of gold. A tsundere extrovert.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418678">
        A guy that loves singing and a guy with Sever depression. They are all suffering from various things and they are tied by a tv program they do together to help teach kids about life and what is right and wrong. They must maintain their happy-go-lucky appearance to be able to keep their job and survive through their dark lives. <br />
<br />
The characters in the anime are a big reason of why it is so good. They interact so well with each other and they support each other knowing that they are all suffering together in this place. With their unique and varying personalities, the anime keeps on building around them. The anime uses the characters to set up some very good jokes like having the kids throw savage comments at the characters or even something simple like a guy uncontrollably laughing at a word that sounds dirty. <br />
<br />
The anime uses these moments and contrasts them well with the actual behind the scene stories. We get to know more about each character and why they became that way. We knew the dark story of Kumatani and how pure he is. We knew about the depression Uramichi is suffering from and the reason he keeps doing his job despite hating it. We knew about why Usahara always makes fun of Uramichi and we got to see how exactly our characters influenced each other. The anime starts as a comedy filled with dark jokes but as the story goes on, we got to see why exactly the dark jokes worked and we got to see how profound the characters are. <br />
<br />
The dialgoue in Uramichi Onii-san was very well-written. The jokes were witty and straight up savage that it left me laughing a lot of times. Whether it be using the dark jokes to display the character&#039;s depressing lifestyles or even using simple jokes like Uramichi getting angry at Usahara or seeing Iketeru laughing at stupid jokes. <br />
On the other hand, the real stuff was heavy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I doing this?&quot;. &quot;Is this what I should be doing?&quot; &quot;Society won&#039;t benefit from anything I do.&quot; &quot;I feel guilty yet I don&#039;t know how make a meaningful use of my time&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I DON&#039;T REALLY KNOW HOW TO LIVE ANYMORE.&quot; <br />
<br />
This part hit different. It might have been that it broke the whole dark humor thing with the kids but I felt there was much more to that. It felt like I was talking to myself and questioning my life. That&#039;s why this part leaves a big effect on you. <br />
<br />
&quot;But at least, I don&#039;t want this time to be wasted.&quot;  <br />
That part right here, helping you understand that you can still control your life, is a big part of why Uramichi Onii-san is a great anime. <br />
<br />
The art and animation are done well enough although when it came to showing Uramichi&#039;s depressed state, it was able to flawlessly capture how different the world is from his view compared to how it actually is. It displayed the mental perspective of Uramichi and how heavy the depression is affecting him which is a big plus in my book. It was also able to show how different the characters were from back in the past and how their lives affected them both physically and emotionally. <br />
<br />
The voice actors were great and each of them did their job perfectly. It was funny listening to Miyano Mamoru laughing at stupid jokes tho :D <br />
<br />
Overall, I would give Uramichi Onii-san a 9/10. A great anime that I would love to see more of. <br />
Would recommend it to anyone looking for a comedy anime with a hint of depression.

    This show is incredible. If I had to introduce it to a western audience, I would describe it as The Joker runs a Children&#039;s television show. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s so good. Essentially the plot revolves around Uramichi Omota who is incredibly depressed and highly emotional unstable. This leads to him frequently commenting on his own depression in front of a crow of small japanese children.<br />
<br />
The shows humor is highlighted by Uramichi given traditional family-friend advice tot the children immediately followed by him  informing the kids about the darkest aspects of adulthood.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not just Uramichi who is dysfunctional  however as most of his co-workers also seem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410481">
        to be rather unfulfilled in life. <br />
<br />
The show absolutely nails the feel of a children&#039;s tv  show like Barney or Blues Clues but with the added dread of the show going drastically wrong and Uramichi saying things you would never want a  child to hear.<br />
<br />

    Overall, this show is just &quot;ah, humour based on my pain&quot; and we&#039;re supposed to laugh. Uramichi Oniisan uses the dissonance of actors looking like they&#039;re having fun, playing in a happy go lucky kids show with an actual cast of characters with depression and other problems in their lives to generate some sort of comedic effect.<br />
It doesn&#039;t work. Rather than find it funny, it&#039;s just kind of repetitive. You already know that right off the bat, Uramichi is going say something cheerful, and then transition into something more depressing. Compound this repetitiveness with unlikeable side characters, and you got one dull ass show. Plus,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418377">
        the punchlines are just weak. For such a simple setup to work, all parts have to be working together in harmony, whether it bet the joke setup, the follow through, and the characters themselves.<br />
 It&#039;s quite clear that comedy based on something like this can be successful. After all, something like watashi ga motenai or zetsubou sensei play off this very concept. At the very least, they&#039;re trying to generate humor off of more dark concepts, but the difference between this show and those two is that Uramichi Oniisan sticks with the same exact setting, lines, and setup with dull characters every time, while you should instead be making Uramichi experiencing a lot of different things in different scenarios. You can&#039;t make me fall in love with a show that fails to do the bare minimum of trying to keep things fresh. There has to be a unique feature about this show, and it just doesn&#039;t seem like it tries to do anything out of the ordinary.

    Meet Uramichi Oniisan, the star of a cute kids&#039; show who would be fired if production took place in the West. But since Japanese parents aren&#039;t overly sensitive, they&#039;re fine with a former gymnast talking about heavy drinking and abusing one of his coworkers in front of their kids. After all, the kids love it!<br />
<br />
Story: This is a slice-of-life anime, but the premise is fun—a group of washed-out adults act in a show teaching kids about important life lessons—and the execution is great. 7/10<br />
<br />
Art: Usao&#039;s bunny costume and Kumao&#039;s bear costume are freaking adorable, and their graphic shirts and jackets allude to their TV characters,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418675">
        like &quot;Wants-to-Quit Bunny.&quot; The animation also does a great job showing the contrast between Uramichi&#039;s forced cheery personality and his actual depressed character. 6/10<br />
<br />
Sound: The soundtrack is full of cute bops for the kid&#039;s show that the characters are part of. There&#039;s great comedic timing all around. 7/10<br />
<br />
Character: As expected of slice-of-life, the characters carry the show. Uramichi Omota is a single 31-year-old man who gets made fun of by kids and coworkers alike for his lonely drinking lifestyle. Tobikichi Usahara is particularly relentless in his teasing, and Uramichi gets him back for it every time to the point that he&#039;s actually afraid of the guy he makes fun of. Mitsuo Kumagai is Usahara&#039;s college roommate who&#039;s the stoic one in the group. Iketeru Daga is the air-headed pretty boy—at 27, he&#039;s the youngest besides the kids. And Utano Tadano is a 32-year-old woman obsessed with the fact that she&#039;s over 30 and unmarried. She isn&#039;t the typical damsel of the group; she&#039;s awesome and funny. Bonus points for a gives-no-cares director. 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Uramichi Oniisan has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, and other moments that are so depressing for Uramichi that they&#039;re funny. 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a fun, light-hearted slice-of-life show. The characters are adults around age 30, resulting in some adult humor and comical situations that aren&#039;t forced. And the TV cast&#039;s friendship rivals the Team Rocket dynamic! 8/10

    ----- GIVE ME THE GOOD STUFF!<br />
<br />
Real, raw, ironic, sarcastic, empathetic, satire, cringe, and you know what,  maybe it&#039;s your life in anime.<br />
<br />
Life is not a shojo maga/anime series, life sucks been an adult is not what you were expecting,and you have to deal with that,  just have to do things that you dont want to because thats life,  and with Uramichi Oniisan, you can see it.<br />
<br />
This series is great, you can feel identified, the story is totally relatable. A lot of humor and dark moments , that are going to put a smile on your face,  and open a cold beer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415869">
        to laugh about life. <br />
<br />
This is GREAT, if you like a dark and weird sense of humor mixed with a bit of adulthood depression and anxiety, this is for you and, I highly recommend it.

    Story 5/10: No actual story but that&#039;s not bad in any way.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10: Nothing exceptional standard, it does what it should.<br />
<br />
Sound 4/10: Opening has a child music theme generally not bad and i get why they choose something like that for the opening, but not really my thing. The ending has a good retheme and many people will like it and vibe with it, but again, not quite my thing. About the voice acting, 1 voice actor sounds like he is 40+ and has a very deep voice while he is playing a 20-30 year old and it comes out VERY badly and takes you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415509">
        out of the &quot;experience&quot; and to top in off that character, is 1 of the 4 main side characters. Also in episode 2, 2 animals appear 1 cat and 1 dog and both sounded awful, to say the least. Do you remember when you were a kid and for some reason you were trying to imitate how a cat or dog sounded like? That&#039;s exactly how the cat and the dog sounded in episode 2, extremely unnatural and gives the vibe that the show is a badly made and it also feels unprofessional.<br />
<br />
Characters 6/10: They are kind of funny but not funny funny, for some people it may be funny, but not so much for me. Someone that may like the humor may go as far as 8/10 in characters but that&#039;s it. In other aspects the characters are likeable and i don&#039;t dislike any of them but i wouldn&#039;t say i particularly like any of them either.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10: I didn&#039;t laugh too much and the few times i laughed it wasn&#039;t a burst of laughter, it was more like a chuckle. Also i find the humor kind of childish, not too much, but it still gives off that vibe. The humor isn&#039;t all bad but the parts that were actually funny weren&#039;t that many and for a show that capitalizes on it&#039;s comedy it&#039;s a big setback. If it weren&#039;t for the terrible voice acting in it, that takes you COMPLETELY out of the &quot;experience&quot; enjoyment might have been a solid 6/10.<br />
<br />
Overall 5/10: I think it has some good points and it&#039;s humor may be liked more by someone else, the characters are fine and again the humor factor about them, terrible voice acting from that 1 character and the animal noises.<br />
I think that my opinion might have had a stronger influence on my scorings a little more than i would have liked it to, thus making it less objective and more personal, so i would like to say that someone that likes the humor more than i did may overall rate this show as 6/10 or even a 7/10 but to rate more than that he would have to absolutely love the comedy, so much as to ignore all the other bad factors of it.

    Where do you see yourself in your early adulthood? Whether that’s 5, 10, or maybe even 20 years from now, it’s always hard to predict what you’ll be like in the future. Do you envision success? Have you accomplished all your dreams? Are you living a fulfilling life?<br />
<br />
Or are you someone like me, who sees an uncertain future. Sure I have my goals, and I’d like to think I’m pretty motivated and driven. But after doing a year of online school in university and interning in the summer, I’ve begun to question whether or not I’d actually enjoy an 80 hour workweek under one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418694">
        the MBB firms despite the great pay it’d offer.<br />
<br />
What will I be doing for the next 10, 20, 30+ years after finishing university? <br />
<br />
I think until you’ve started having these existential thoughts and worked through the toils of university/internships/part-time jobs, you won’t be able to fully appreciate the beauty behind the tragic dark-comedy of Uramichi Oniisan.<br />
<br />
I think this is one of the best anime this season. Not just for its comedy, but also the context behind it: the struggles of early adulthood. A time where you’d expect one to be burning with passion in a job you love, pursuing and accomplishing your goals. Instead, for you, me, and the majority of others who read this, we will be sorely disappointed. <br />
<br />
What makes Uramichi Oniisan so incredible is its cast of tragic characters. Stuck in jobs they don’t (entirely) love, working to meet the ridiculous demands of their superiors for little rewards, and constantly left wondering what went wrong with their life. <br />
<br />
While we see time and time again that Uramichi and his co-stars would prefer any other job, they continue coming back day after day to appease the little bundles of joy and hope before them. This foil between depressed adults and energetic children is refreshing every time it’s brought up because it’s so true. While I only briefly worked as a camp leader in high school, it’s exhausting putting in your all to make young kids happy. A sentiment shared by all the lead performers. <br />
<br />
Yet, I’ve found that there’s catharsis in this kind of work, no matter how tiring it gets. This is why Uramichi shows up every day because even though he’s lost hope in himself, these young innocent kids still blindly believe in him. So as to not disappoint them and ensure they don’t turn out like him, he drags his ass outta bed every day at 6 am. It’s a stark reminder that life won’t always work out how you’d like, but you have no option other than to continue to push onwards and face whatever challenges head your way. <br />
<br />
It’s up to you to decide if you’ll become an Uramichi who’s depressed and lost all hope, or if you’ll continue chasing your dreams with the same passion you had while you were younger.<br />
<br />
Uramichi is a great show for the comedy. But once you’ve gathered enough life experience or reached a certain age, the intent behind the dark-comedy and gags hits different and makes you appreciate the series in a different light. You’d be hard-pressed to find another comedy series out there that can also be appreciated for its deeper themes and central message, and this rare perceptiveness is what sets Uramichi Oniisan apart from so many other similar shows. <br />
<br />
“You may not be able to live for someone else, but it’d be nice if you chose to live in a way in which you don’t blame others.” - one of many gems dropped throughout the show by our beloved gymnast oniisan.<br />

    Short review (for yall TLDR s):-<br />
“Give up on your dreams and die” -Levi Ackerman <br />
<br />
Most of uramichi’s cast took it seriously :3<br />
<br />
Most of us would have seen that one meme of uramichi in which the kids are asked “what are the main things kids have and adults don’t?”<br />
<br />
And the children answer …..<br />
<br />
1)Santas present <br />
2)elementary school <br />
3)heart <br />
4)hope<br />
5)dreams<br />
<br />
Uramich ‘you are all correct’ <br />
<br />
This is one of the best aspects of uramichi’s comedy, how they don’t sugarcoat any words and let it all out with a straight face. XD<br />
<br />
This is basically the best I can do to sell this show. It is a dark comedy show. With

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418669">
        a cast that always reminds us of how dead they (we) are inside. If you arent convinced yet please stick around till the end of this review <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Long review:-<br />
<br />
Uramichi oniisan Episode one, Imagine having a bunch of kids being involved in a children’s reality show and every adult working with them is basically dead inside? where the first lesson you teach the kids is how the adults have to fake a smile to even get by in life? You will cringe at first but then It’ll all start to be too relatable that it’s sad. <br />
<br />
It is a dark seinen comedy show which follows two major aspects of adult life.<br />
<br />
Somehow you will find a bunch of 30-year-olds being surrounded by cute kids and mascots, a  colorful set, and hating their entire lifespan and decisions (even the amount yet to come) and find it so funny you would laugh till you drop.but then you think “the children are sometimes oddly mature and hit em where it hurts”<br />
<br />
<br />
 A couple of important hints about this are thrown our way which many would have missed so I think some of the kids in the audience are actually us? don’t believe me? <br />
<br />
<br />
--This is a seinen series and in episode one uramichi faces the camera in the monologue scene and says<br />
<br />
 “adults have to be two-faced and three-faced. pretend you kids didn’t see it , okay?”<br />
<br />
This was a clear indication that some of the kids represent us a sad working community that assumes that everyone must follow the norm and must have figured their life out when they are 30 . if they dont we question them and their capability.<br />
<br />
The author clearly was influenced by oyasumi punpun’s (one of the best dark comedy manga ) bird character since there is the same abstract bird character in the show that shouldn’t fit but still fits in such an ironic way, The spacer’s choice from outer worlds (video game) resembling mascot looks pretty dope too . <br />
<br />
<br />
Its other dark comedy is about the unfair corporate lifestyle, ill try not to mention how exactly because it’ll drain out the fun. <br />
<br />
<br />
The characters are genuinely so funny that it is on the level of the legendary comedy shows i.e. Gintama, grand blue, Hina Matsuri, etc . the voice acting is great it’s so well-timed that you will laugh and cringe at their (and in extension your xD) pathetic lives, iketuru’s wheeze laugh is such a lmao moment.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way the Ending song of this anime catches the entire vibe of this anime so well and is so good in general, you won’t be able to skip it at least 3 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
“The anime seems to be a comedy at first but drops some genuinely relatable stuff, like how people feel like they&#039;re not being productive with their time or doing something worth doing/having fun or being happy in general. Not only that, but not understanding what it is that you want in life and being unsatisfied, but unchanging in your lifestyle.” -- cookiethe lord (youtube comment stealing the very words from my mind XD)<br />
<br />
<br />
Cmon this should be enough of a sell ja? I mean, dark comedy, hopeless adults, self-hatred yet they act all cheerful and happy while they are dead inside since they literally have to act(that’s their job)? This is easily a criminally underrated must-watch show.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    There is not much else to say apart from that this show is a great, relatable anime. The characters are all great in their own ways, the humor also hit the spot every time and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime so far. Iketeru oniisan&#039;s laugh is also another highlight of the show. As I typed at the start, this show is also very relatable for working adults and seeing Uramichi and his coworkers deal with certain situations imposed by their boss or just general life problems as you get older is great to see. There are only 2 episodes left as I am

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417336">
        typing this review and I am going to miss watching this every Monday. (Another good thing about this show is that it aired every Monday and it made me feel much happier and actually look forward to Monday). Anyways, that&#039;s it for this review and I hope you will consider watching Uramichi Oniisan.

    I enjoyed this show so much more than I was expecting too! It had been on my watch list for a while just because I liked the sound of the premise and needed something a bit more light-hearted after watching some emotionally gruelling shows, and to my surprise it delivered so many more laughs than I was ready for. <br />
<br />
The all &quot;too hard to swallow pills&quot; of adult life is a realisation I&#039;m sure many people can relate to and I was concerned that this would become the butt of every joke and become overplayed. I was wrong! There are so many more things about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418739">
        this show to love and laugh at. <br />
<br />
Each character is great in their own way, and provides laughable entertainment in their individual situations. As well as providing us with some serious moments, which help to ground the characters in their relatable reality and their struggles. <br />
<br />
The art style and editing is hilarious in its own right. Some of the comedic timing and stylised editing is really well done and heightens many of the jokes. <br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t enjoyed watching a show this much in so long, and I&#039;m sad it has come to an end! Fingers crossed for season 2!! <br />

    This anime is simply-amazing. This is not your facial expression jokes but are intended to make you relate to them. Story is set where dead inside mc works at a TV children program. Dealing with kids, director, colleague interactions is his life.<br />
Characters are good, Uramichi, iketeru, utana and two juniors are amazing in their own way. <br />
Voice acting: Cast is god tier. Mamoru as usual stands out alot with his precious voice and ed is also sung by him.<br />
Animation: It&#039;s good, not that outstanding but its SOL anime so its fits great. Also, some dance animation are really great. <br />
Sound: Fairly good, op is fine,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411072">
        Ed is amazing<br />
Art: Great, they have put effort in it and have not taken any easy steps. <br />
Enjoyment: I am enjoying alot. I seriously wait for this <br />
 Overall: 8/10 for me

    The humor in this might not be for everyone, but it is certainly warming my little shriveled millennial heart. The juxtaposition between the main characters and the children is really funny! Even the exposition is a joke. The little asides from the kids are fun too!<br />
Each character has a certain charm to them and the show certainly plays with the tropes in a unique way! The only character whose trope isn&#039;t that unique is singer onesan. And Usahara can be a little grating in my opinion (the pink bunny). But even has his moments. All the other characters are ridiculous fun.<br />
If you enjoy dark humor,

    Usao-kun perfectly described this show as a bunch of hardcore sadists, masquerading as a kids&#039; educational show.<br />
<br />
Uramachi Oniisan is the perfect example of how life pans out after your 20s, where you lose enthusiasm in all aspects of life. It&#039;s a satire of the typical kids-oriented TV show, which more often than not shows the true face of the people behind their cheerful personas.<br />
<br />
Uramichi Oniisan is the lead, showing how his mental health has basically spiraled downwards despite being a gymnastics teacher on the kids show. He lacks motivation and breaks out of his persona while the cameras are rolling, showing how ruthless adult life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410456">
        can be to the kids.<br />
<br />
Iketeru Oniisan likes adult jokes and has an amazing laugh, but tends to not be socially aware.<br />
<br />
Utana is an unmarried woman in her 30s and you can imagine the sort of toll it takes on her.<br />
<br />
Usao Bunny is basically the annoying kouhai of Uramichi and tends to face the brunt of Uramichi&#039;s physical outbursts. (Bonus: He is voiced by Tomokazu Sugita, the voice for Sakata Gintoki)<br />
<br />
Kumao Bunny is the straight-man of the group and also the mysterious one, who you don&#039;t learn much about (at least until episode 4)<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend this anime to anyone who loves satire, and dry humour. It&#039;s an enjoyable watch in the current season and definitely worth the watch.

    the anime is so hilarious. What the hell? I haven&#039;t had such a hearty laugh since the start of this year. What makes this anime even incredible is that it&#039;s still new and it has done a great job capturing hearts and minds.<br />
<br />
I love the fact that you don&#039;t need to understand the jokes but the situations are just damn funny enough to make you laugh. I love what happened in episode 1. That laugh the voice actor did was just so real. Still fresh in memory.<br />
<br />
The characters are amazing too. Uramichi, our emotionally unstable character is relatable on some levels (may differ from everyone).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422499">
        I love how emotionally broken he is. It&#039;s no funny matter but the author turned this into a comedic show....what can I do?<br />
Usahara-kun is just another lovable idiot. Why do you keep provoking Uramichi, your senpai. Usahara-kun never learns.<br />
I&#039;m not a fan of female characters in animes but Utano is going wild. She is the type who come to terms that life isn&#039;t easy and being a cute character like the others won&#039;t save you. You&#039;ve got to face it. Fight on, Utano-san.<br />
Kumagai-san is very relaxed and reserved. He will do anything to run away from trouble...even if it meant sacrificing Usahara. The ultimate bro.<br />
Iketaru oniisan, I wanna be care free like you but man, what&#039;s up with all those d**k jokes....LOL ! His laughter makes me laugh.<br />
<br />
If children could get life lessons from Uramichi Oniisan, I am sure our world will know how to deal with situations more....the future can be really bleak.....some things can&#039;t save you all the time. Your mind might have its defence mechanism to escape from reality. In the end you will be always dragged back into reality again and again...no matter how much you escape...it is the circle of life. The way and the truth of life...you can&#039;t escape....<br />
you have to put a smile on...even if you have to fake it(- Uramichi-san)....<br />
<br />
Overall, good story. Relatable life lessons. Hilarious comedy linked with reality and hints of depression and or pessimism.<br />
<br />
If you decide to watch it, please enjoy the show...<br />
it&#039;s hilarious alright...but sometimes you&#039;ve gotta watch some comedy and laugh your sorrows away...

    At first, the series has very good, memorable musical themes. When, after the end of the final episode, I ran to look for manga, as I read, they sounded in my head. Actually, they set half of the mood and atmosphere of &quot;Uramichi Oniisan&quot;. I will also say that some of them were not repeated, which made the scenes accompanied by them even better and more valuable for me.<br />
OP and ED performed their tasks one hundred percent. OP clearly showed the flip sides of the &quot;expectation-reality&quot; medal on the set of a children&#039;s show. ED forced me to reflect on the balance of power at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420588">
        my leisure. After all, in fact, a good half of the cast Maman to Together only declares that they are not interested in a relationship. And this is another advantage to the author Gaku Kuze: as it turned out, he is a master of subtle hints and detailed character study.<br />
I started watching... and after the third episode, I was surprised to realize that I would continue. Very soon I became imbued with the interaction of Uramichi with co-hosts, as well as Usao and Kumao. For a reason, the author gave the mascots separate chapters that were almost completely included in the anime. Through their communication with the MC, they reveal not only his personality and the main problems of adult existence, but also their own, sometimes global ones.<br />
The big surprise for me was that Uramichi actually an &quot;older brother&quot; not only for the children on the set, but also for many of his colleagues. Many of Uramichi&#039;s actions are dictated not only and not so much by depression, the desire to take revenge on stupid subordinates and an almost complete loss of faith in people. He unobtrusively teaches life lessons to everyone who happens to be nearby.<br />
In fact, Uramichi-oniisan is quite perceptive, honest with himself and others, sympathetic and even secretly romantic. The problem is that all these qualities are not always useful to Uramichi in real life. Sometimes he is powerless before the hypocrisy and unfairness  that are happening before his eyes. But Uramichi is ready to do everything possible for all those in need, if it helps them a little bit.<br />
I&#039;d like to see the sequel. &quot;Uramichi-oniisan&quot; conceals many meanings and layers under a deliberately childish, bright and colorful cover. Often the laughter is bitter, and jokes are created by not at all funny phenomens of adult life. <br />
And that&#039;s great. &quot;I didn&#039;t know that being &quot;normal&quot; meant pretending not to see the hypocrisy and unfairness. I still think that if you&#039;re going to let those things corrupt you, better just to throw it all away.&quot;
