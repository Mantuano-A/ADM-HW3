    To start off, for anyone who have watched the previous installments of Hibike! Euphonium, both season 1 and 2, you&#039;ll find that this new sequel doesn&#039;t deviate much, if at all, from the seasons in terms or storytelling or theme. It&#039;s pretty much a speedrun of Hibike! Euphonium condensed into 1 movie with new characters added in. There is nothing added in the movie that truly breaks from the mold already established by both previous seasons. The movie is centered around certain 1st years who enter the high school and join band. Each of them have their own unique problems relating to band drama and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312544">
        personal conflicts with one another. With the last graduating class gone, there is a large hole in the club in terms of both numbers and talent, and tensions are high once again as old scars are brought up and new people bring their own baggage to the stage.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll talk about the positives first. <br />
The music, as expected, is fantastic. The soundtrack is amazing and really sets in the mood for you to relax and enjoy. I had no problems with it really. The music played by the band is also incredible and it really does the series justice. If you haven&#039;t watched the spin off movie Liz and the Blue Bird, I highly do suggest you watch it beforehand to get a better grasp on the music piece played by the band. It made the orchestra scene so much better and emotionally powerful. This is just a suggestion for fans of the series who are invested in the musical aspect. <br />
The art is fantastic as always. It&#039;s the same classic style you see from season 1 and 2. Nothing much changed and nothing much really needed to change. The quality was still good and while the animation itself was nothing much to brag about, the art and cinematography more than make up for that. There was nothing as well animated as the Kumiko running scene or the Reina smile scene in season 1 but the movie still held up high in regards to looking great. <br />
The thing about Hibike! is that it is a character driven show, and as much as people give the music the highest praise, the characters are the best part of it. I really appreciated the fact that they did build up the characters we were familiar with, such as Natsuki and Kumiko. You see them still grow and adapt to their new roles in the club, especially as they are a year older now and they must shoulder the responsibilities that their former mentors held. The movie didn&#039;t totally just remove their role in the band in favor of the new students. However this becomes a double edged sword. I talk about the negatives regarding the characters below but the positives are still there in the mix. The character drama is all generally realistic in its portrayal of not only band culture but of competition. The series themes resonate with the movie still regarding both the philosophy of talent and winning. Because for some, winning is the only thing that matters, while for others, it&#039;s the effort in achieving either success or failure that is what is most important. You can achieve nothing but that is better than doing nothing. Hibike! prides itself on centering themes around this type of philosophy and they do a great job. It&#039;s why Hibike! is so good. If anything else, I consider the overarching theme in the movie to be the best positive I can write about.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be moving on to the negatives now.<br />
The movie was fairly rushed and you rarely have time to settle down with certain scenes and their implications before moving onto another problem. One of the reasons for this was that they heavily condensed the novel from which the movie was adapted from, cutting almost half of the substance. And while of course the anime movie should be judged independently from any other source, it does explain why the plot seems to be as if some scenes are being skipped. So when you are watching the movie don&#039;t worry if you do get slightly confused, some context is missing. And while this issue is not obvious all the time it does seem noticeable in a few important scenes relating to the new characters. You see them lash out spontaneously and their reasoning while perhaps justified have no real set up, making it as if we were supposed to have watch another prequel about the new 1st years before this movie to really understand them. We don&#039;t know enough about them to emphasize with them on anything but a shallow level. The pacing wouldn&#039;t have been that much of an issue but certain things seem to snowball together for a bit of confusion towards the end of the movie. KyoAni was essentially juggling screen time between the popularity of the old characters for fans and the introduction of the new ones. <br />
The drama of the series is also a part where this rushed storytelling suffers from. The movie switches between the personal problems of Kumiko and the problems of the 1st years. And so what you get is kind of this underdeveloped conclusion to both in certain ways. While of course you can give the benefit of the doubt as there will be a sequel season 3, the movie seems to dilute the new characters a little too much. We rarely get to see them outside of their drama, acting as students circumnavigating band life in its entirety. It&#039;s more that we see them as walking talking plot points to address in order to move the story forward. You don&#039;t really know who they are as a person and I think that for a series like Hibike! there should have been a little more due diligence in fleshing out the new characters for the audience to relate to. The new characters all suffer from a lack of believable development save for one of them. The story tries its hardest to make up for that by giving them all emotional conclusions to their personal arcs but it feels somewhat hollow. <br />
<br />
The movie may offer nothing truly &quot;new&quot; to the table for those already familiar with Hibike! but it does give us a small glimpse of the greatness that was season 1 and why the series is so popular.

    I just watched the film in theaters and it was great! All Sound! Euphonium fans should watch it, as it is indeed a continuation of the series.<br />
<br />
Like all movies, material is condensed, and there&#039;s quite literally nothing we can do about it except show our support for the makers in hopes of getting more content. The film starts by giving a 10 minute review of what happened in the first 2 seasons, and then kicks off. One should definitely watch &quot;Liz and the Blue Bird&quot; before watching this, because there are quite a few connections to that movie (don&#039;t wanna spoil anything).<br />
<br />
I agree, this could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312835">
        have easily been a season in and of itself, but it was crammed into a movie. There was a little bit too much drama for just a movie, and although we know the series has drama, they overdid it a bit for the duration of the film. <br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the piece they played, and I love how they take the time to animate the entire duration of the song and the characters playing! The piece was not as moving as the &quot;Crescent Moon Dance&quot;, but maybe because we don&#039;t have a big back story behind this new piece like we did in the first 2 seasons. Also, seeing familiar faces come back on screen was a very pleasant surprise. If I say anything else I might spoil it, so I&#039;ll stop, HOWEVER, there is an after-credits scene that some people might enjoy a lot.

Thanks to Fathom Events, this Hibike! Euphonium fan was able to see the latest installment of the series on the big screen, and I enjoyed it a lot. Hibike! Euphonium Movie 3: Chikai no Finale follows Kumiko and her friends on her second year of high school, directly after Hibike! Euphonium 2. If you&#039;re just reading for my general opinion: Overall, the movie suffers from the issues you would expect from condensing a season&#039;s worth of story into roughly 2 hours and may not be great as a standalone film, but is definitely worth a watch for anyone who liked the first two seasons.<br />
<br />
As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312834">
        you would expect, this movie delivers the same outstanding aesthetics you would expect from Hibike! Euphonium and Kyoto Animation. The character designs have that signature kyoani moe, the backgrounds are vibrant and gorgeous, and the animation is a step above their competitors. Not on the level of standalone films like Koe no Katachi, but definitely not a step down or a huge improvement from the Hibike! Euphonium anime. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s what this movie felt like, just a continuation of the main series rather than something separate like Liz and the Blue Bird (which is now a priority for me after seeing a particular scene in this movie). There&#039;s a bit of deja vu from the first season, and the movie showcases recurring events for the Kitauji Band, such as the Sunrise Festival. Unfortunately, some of the little day to day interactions were cut to make time for these pivotal events. As expected of this series, there&#039;s a lot of character drama leading up to the big performance, including freshman recruitment and competition auditions. The narrative doesn&#039;t go out of its way to introduce any new concepts, it just shows similar sequences as the first season, but now the characters are in different positions. But that isn&#039;t a bad thing in itself, as it shows how Kumiko and the now second and third years have matured and learned from their past mistakes, and their new determination to succeed at Nationals. An example is Yuko, who as the new captain of the band has to learn to become an effective leader, and further progresses from the character she was in season 1.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, that&#039;s where this film faltered. As expected, a new school year brings in lots of new characters. At the same time, some second and third years who didn&#039;t get a character arc previously also got an extra spotlight. But of course, there were only an hour and 50 minutes to tell everyone&#039;s story, so some of these new faces definitely got the short end of the stick. It was disappointing to see some interesting new characters shown on screen who either completely ignored or given a character arc that lasts about 5 minutes. There was really only one freshman character who we got to know well. At the same time there were some recurring characters that had their own drama, but got so little screen-time in the past installments that I just had no idea how I was supposed to feel about them. But the lackluster character development doesn&#039;t feel too bad in this kind of movie, since it&#039;s pretty obvious that this was just a bridge to lead into the inevitable Hibike! Euphonium 3. If this was a standalone film, I would&#039;ve come out of the theater way more dissatisfied. I&#039;m sure these looked-over characters will be able to shine in the next season. I won&#039;t say exactly what happened, but the romance progressed further in this movie than it did the past two seasons. The romantic tensions unfortunately felt a bit rushed, but still were so heartwarming and cute that I couldn&#039;t help but laugh and smile along with everyone else in the theater. There&#039;s something here for fans of all ships!<br />
<br />
But aside from the pacing of the movie leading to a lack of character development, this was a fantastic experience. The music is absolutely incredible, as you would expect. Arguably, the best part of the movie was the performance scene; it might just be my favorite in the series yet. The smooth animation, slick camera movement, good use of 3D, combined with the gorgeous soundtrack made for a truly blissful experience in the last leg of the movie. Seeing it in theaters only made it more magical.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s what I thought of the movie. This is definitely a must watch for anyone that is still interested in following Kumiko and Kitauji in their quest for Gold, but I would advise anyone who hasn&#039;t seen the tv anime yet to watch that before seeing this movie. As a standalone movie with no context, this will be a pretty dissatisfying film. And as always, feel free to ignore the numbers you see here and have your own opinions on the movie. As for me, Chikai no Finale has got me even more excited for the next chapter in the Hibike! Euphonium story.

    Honestly, I didn&#039;t really think we needed this movie, but...eh, I&#039;m not against it.  Could it have been better?  Oh definitely.  Story probably could&#039;ve used a proofread.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
With the new school year incoming, Kumiko Oumae and the previous veterans of the Kitauji High School Band come back with new members, new drama, and a new goal in mind for the school year.  Now with the bronze reward in Nationals under their belt, it was finally time to try again and get the coveted gold they weren&#039;t able to get in the year prior.<br />
<br />
Given that the entirety of the movie is centered around Kumiko&#039;s entire second year

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312896">
        of high school, it comes as no surprise that the series is the most rushed it&#039;s ever been.  Given the fact that the series prior had cemented its story into giving both the regionals and nationals competition its own season, seeing the entire journey up to regionals be given less than half a season of screentime is not exactly the most ideal situation.  In doing so, both of the character stories for the new members of the Bass section feel rushed, a lot of smaller plot threads (including the romance one) feel less than satisfactory, and a staggering amount of jump cuts are used to progress the flow of time.<br />
<br />
And I mean A LOT of jump cuts.  Watching the movie, I couldn&#039;t tell which month we were in because the chronology is simply that fast.  One minute we&#039;re given the introduction, and maybe twenty minutes later we&#039;ve hit summer vacation and the band camp.  It also doesn&#039;t help that the stories of the characters at hand were solely based on their respective backstories without enough meaningful interaction between them and the rest of the band to give full weight of the problem.  It was honestly more annoying to watch because one of the girls kept snapping or leaving the situation to the point that that was her only worthwhile character trait before we were given her spiel/trauma from her past.<br />
<br />
That being said, the movie did still provide enough of the series&#039;s themes and existentialism that&#039;s been around since the series started.  Kumiko and Reina deciding for themselves what&#039;s to come while proving that life is full of failures whether we like it or not are mainstays that keep the series engaging and unique from a lot of other school series.  Even more so, the ending was a great poetic tribute to the themes of the series though expected as it was.  It&#039;s the one redeeming quality I can say about the storytelling in this movie and is at least a decent takeaway from the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
I feel like this is Kumiko&#039;s most major existence in the series thus far.  While she was always the &#039;protagonist character&#039;, she never really felt like that due to her tendency to always sit in the back while everything happens in front of her and more important events and stories became the spotlight of the series.  Because she now has seniority in the club, Kumiko seems to be taking a more active role by trying to sort out problems with others rather than always sitting back like she used to.  That trait even ends up biting her later on and the reflection of who she is and what she wants is positive growth to become motivated and really push the spirit of the series in an attempt to try give her all.<br />
<br />
Much of the rest of the screentime is devoted to the newer additions to the cast, specifically Kanade Hisaishi as Kumiko&#039;s underclassmen in the Euphonium section.  Much of the movie&#039;s character drama focuses on her and the new tubas in the band, storylines that really feel the weight of the rushing storyline the movie was unfortunately forced to deal with.  In a way it feels like the movie was just following the steps of its predecessors as they didn&#039;t feel naturally integrated or abundantly present through conflict of gut reactions like before.  Fortunately, Kanade still does have a presence in the movie, though only through proxy of being next to Kumiko the whole time, which is not something I&#039;m fond of even though she is an interesting character.<br />
<br />
The rest of the Kitauji veterans do not get much time in the movie&#039;s run aside from a few small plot threads sprinkled throughout to detail the state of the band and the changing times.  Some old characters make cameos, the romance subplot was shot down before it started, some other characters that I don&#039;t particularly remember get some time to themselves, but only enough to make a small impact or change without upheaving the entire storyline.  It&#039;s ok, but personally I wish there was a little more to them being their at large.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
Of course KyoAni pulls out all the stops for their better shows; why wouldn&#039;t they?  Is what I would be saying except for some reason, despite being a movie, &#039;Chikai no Finale&#039; looks almost identical to the normal art for the series.  Hibike! has always had REALLY good art as the care, love, and detail the series is given by KyoAni is miles above what a typical anime gets.  But it almost feels like even on the big screen, it&#039;s still like watching the show when generally there&#039;re higher production standards for movies.  What those higher production standards would be, I don&#039;t know, but something in me thinks there should&#039;ve been SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
The only standout part that the movie has in terms of art or animation appears in the final section of the movie during the performance.  A whole variety of shots ranging from wide angle shots to zoom ins, pan arounds, to close ups of each individual key or lever being pushed on a specific member of the band.  (I suspect this is where the budget went).  It was honestly really impressive seeing this particular scene given how 3-D models were only used sparingly during the wider shots, but the more up close areas were all in 2-D with the same level of quality the rest of the movie had.  There were a number of somewhat unsatisfactory shortcuts that happened during this scene and many of the wider shots in the movie, but given how grand they decided to make the final performance, I can look over that.<br />
<br />
Especially since the sound quality from the band is something of a nostalgia trip to me with a number of small details that give the series its own sense of flair.  Everything from the small breaths in between the lengths of making notes, speedier tempo in one specific scene in an attempt to throw an audition, and the quality of the pieces shown in the final performance were (quite literally) music to my ears.  I love how much time and effort the &#039;Sound&#039; in &#039;Hibike!&#039; Euphonium is given, and this movie was certainly no exception to the already impressive repertoire of sound bites this series has given.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
This movie is a lot of ups and downs for me.  I have a personal attachment to Hibike! mostly due to the fact that, as a previous band member, a lot of the practices and little mishaps that occur during the series put me back in a time when those things became an every day occurrence.  The solid sound of the band tuning, the stops midway through the piece to adjust how one section sounds, and the general contempt for wanting to play a bass instrument all give me a reason to really like this series.<br />
<br />
But the awful pacing makes the story feel like a requirement than a natural part of the series.  I didn&#039;t really get invested in a lot of the newer freshman because they didn&#039;t get time to sink in.  I didn&#039;t care much for the smaller side threads because there wasn&#039;t time to explain them.  I felt cheated at the romance because while it made sense, not enough effort was put into build it up before breaking it down.  It&#039;s these things and so many others that makes this movie feel average instead of great.  I wanted reasons to care about other people other than Kumiko, which wasn&#039;t possible given how many people are in the band and how many of them were featured in this movie alongside with her to create the personal drama the series is known for.  It feels kind of satisfactory, but not at the same time, which is a damn shame because I&#039;ve always had a soft spot for this series.<br />
<br />
On its own, the movie is a pretty good trip.  But when put alongside its sister seasons, it&#039;s probably the lowest point the series has had in progressing its story.  Time crunch is a real problem and movies that fail to properly work around this problem are unfortunately given a poor treatment.  Apparently there&#039;s going to be a season 3 after this, but in my mind, this should&#039;ve been what Season 3 was going to be about.  Because I&#039;m sure a full length cour was straight up just going to do better than adapting it into a movie that didn&#039;t have enough time.

    Hibike! Euphonium always impressed me with everything it has to offer. From the start to the end, I had no regrets watching the show, and I just couldn&#039;t wait to see how it ends! <br />
<br />
So how was Chikai no Finale for me? Well. Mhh. I&#039;d say it was something I didn&#039;t really expect but still expected it to a degree... And here&#039;s why : <br />
<br />
I started the movie expecting for romance development and a good closure. What did I end up getting? Just a realistic closure with a few life lessons in which some were already used back in the series and that&#039;s about it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331624">
        <br />
<br />
The movie wasn&#039;t great enough to surpass my expectations. But at the same time, it wasn&#039;t too bad either. The sound covers up for pretty much everything else that feels missy. So Hibike remains at the borderline of 10/10. But despite the fact that I&#039;ve given it a full score. I think the ending could be way better than this if the show didn&#039;t take a turn into the realism of bands n&#039; stuff too much. Ok. I mean it&#039;s ok. But at least don&#039;t dump other things like romance into the bin. That&#039;s all I ask for. <br />
<br />
Overall the movie was OK. Not too good not too bad. Slightly disappointed, kinda expected. That is all.

    Actually, I have a lot of hopes for this &quot;Hibike Euphonium movie&quot;, because this is a sequel movie, not a recap. Kyoto Animation always succeeds in making beautiful TV series, and even better when making a movie, I said.<br />
<br />
but it turns out my expectations are too high. I&#039;m not saying this movie is bad, I really like it because I can see Kumiko and friends again, and can hear &quot;Liz and Blue Bird&quot; in full orchestra, its beautiful song. but in my opinion the conflict is still less climax than what happened in hibike euphonium 2nd season, the conflict that existed in season 2 really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329838">
        made me carry a complicated atmosphere. Orchestral music in season 2 can also make me cry emotions because it&#039;s really cool.<br />
<br />
But, one year kumiko was spent in 1 movie? really?. if indeed to spend 1 year kumiko in the second school year, I&#039;m a little disappointed. The story line presented in my opinion is not yet finished. not as good as other KyoAni movie, this movie still keeps many questions unanswered after watching. maybe it&#039;s a good idea if this series will get further adaptation, but in my opinion that way makes this film less climax.<br />
<br />
Despite all that, I am still grateful to &quot;Kyoto Animation&quot; and other parties involved, who have worked hard to bring this beautiful work. I hope that the journey of Kumiko and friends will continue.

    Hibike! Euphonium Movie 3: Chikai no Finale, or Sound! Euphonium: Our Promise: A Brand New Day, just Kyoto Animations giving us their best and still, after two seasons, is such a fantastic watch.<br />
<br />
Please, please, watch the series...<br />
<br />
What can I say, Kyoto Animation does it again. To start, I do want to admit or at least point out about my rating of this show as slightly biased. I have watched the first season and that blew me away, the story, characters, the realism is so on point and accurate that there is nothing to hate about it. Even I&#039;ll admit the second season wasn&#039;t close to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330828">
        the first, I still enjoyed it a lot. So, with that, the movie. If you are familiar with the series by now the movie is just a continuation of Oumae going through her second year in high school. I must be honest, having said this might not sound interesting at all. Even other reviews about this movie have to say otherwise, some scoring it way lower than I gave. But, do keep in mind that this is about the second year of high school and that the majority of what will happen has already happened in the first year. I feel that this movie is a perfect runway for the third installment to the series with the upcoming season. Definitely it will be a bore to watch the second year in a season, this just leads up to what they can present us in the third year of Oumae&#039;s life being the third season. Truly, I feel that this condensed version of a season just takes the good parts of the series and only presents that. Even adding a bit of romance, slice of life and school. <br />
<br />
-SCORES-<br />
<br />
Character- 9/10: Almost all the characters are just the same as before, all lovely people. Additionally, Oumae and Tsukamoto is the definition of relationship goals. Like seriously, I adore them so much, both parties are just doing everything right in a relationship. Even though Tsukamoto did that awkward kiss, he managed to fix his error back later on. Plus, come on, those two love birds are such a breeze to watch. I guess the only issue I had was Kanade, I didn&#039;t like her initial behavior but it developed into something much better later on. <br />
<br />
Art- 10/10: Eye candy, just, eye candy. Even at scenes where it is minor, the art just brings the characters to life.<br />
<br />
Writing- 8/10: Yes I&#039;ll admit that the story could have been more interesting, that is not to say that it&#039;s close to being terrible. If you&#039;re a person who loved the first season, I&#039;m sure you will get that same enjoyment as I did.<br />
<br />
Sound- 10/10: Oh my GOSH are you kidding me, that scene when they were paying is just amazing. Now I am not into orchestra but I do admit good music when I hear it, and this, this, this is an experience.<br />
<br />
Overall, yes yes and yes from Kyoto Animation for doing it again. At this point, all we can do is just wait till the next season drops and I am fairly confident that Kyoto Animation can continue to deliver this kind of standard despite suffering that devastating loss from the arson. All prayers go to Kyoto Animation and I am happy to see their next installment.<br />
<br />

    There it is! I finally got to see the movie sequel of this sweet, realistic, music-centered anime. When I watched Sound Euphonium, I was delighted with pretty much everything: the realistic vibes, the top-notch animation, the great orchestral music, the characters.<br />
I was really looking for more of that, and we got it in this movie! Was it worth it? Definitely. In fact, I have more issues with things WE DIDN&#039;T get in the movie than with things that we got.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
Let&#039;s start with what we did get. This movie shows the second year of Kumiko in high-school. Once again, she&#039;s in the orchestral band, and once

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343837">
        again, they&#039;ll try to get the Gold in Regional and Natonal competitions.<br />
New year, new students. Kumiko is now a senpai and has to deal with the young ones. It was great to see Kumiko as a senpai, after spending so long being a kouhai. It&#039;s the cycle of life, but it&#039;s still touching, lol.<br />
Anyway, in the movie, just like the series, the characters have to deal with personal issues as well as the pressure of the competition. The various stories of the many characters were really nice to follow, and it all blends in together pretty well, just like the series.<br />
<br />
When I learned that it was only 1h40 long, I was afraid that it either wouldn&#039;t tell much or it would go too fast. Luckily, the pacing was perfect in my opinion. It does tell a lot for a short movie, but it doesn&#039;t feel rushed at all.<br />
<br />
My only complaint is the fact that it is so much like the series. I mean, it makes sense from a storytelling point of view: yearly events happen every year. It&#039;s obvious, right? It&#039;s what happens in this movie. As a result, just like the series, the band:<br />
- finds new students,<br />
- makes a march to show themselves,<br />
- practices until the actual band is chosen for the competition,<br />
- goes to a summer training camp,<br />
- trains harder for the Regionals,<br />
...<br />
<br />
Luckily, in my opinion, the authors dealt with it pretty well. The repetitive side of the story is used to throw many references to the past and show the evolution of the characters. It also makes this story even more realistic.<br />
I still consider this a flaw of the movie, but I think it was handled pretty well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s get to the main issue of this movie: the things we DIDN&#039;T get.<br />
In this movie, some main characters barely feature. If you&#039;re a fan of Reina, you may be disappointed. She&#039;s there, but not so important. Taki-sensei also doesn&#039;t have a lot of screen time. I was soooo looking forward to seeing him being severe!<br />
Also, this movie clearly isn&#039;t an end, as many elements of the story are willingly left aside.<br />
Kumiko&#039;s relationship with Tsukamoto, the competition, the new characters&#039; stories: those things are in the movie, but are not finished. That leaves me hungry for more, and not in a good way.<br />
Also, Nozomi and her friend didn&#039;t get a single scene for them! They&#039;re here, but don&#039;t say a single word in the entire movie! I mean, it makes sense, considering they got an entire movie for themselves (Liz and the Blue Bird). But that disappointed me.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART<br />
Wonderful in every aspect, just like the anime. I feel like the eyes are a bit smaller and spread wider, compared to the anime. It didn&#039;t bother me, it just felt a bit weird at first.<br />
The animation, once again, was god-tier. The sync between the musicians&#039; motions and the music is astounding.<br />
KyoAni once agains shows off their attention to detail, be it Kumiko&#039;s slight look on the side (when her kouhai almost insults her), Reina&#039;s subtle frowning (when she hears a girl say she loves Taki-sensei), or clever framing.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
This is a show about music, so music is important. And it was great... from a technical point of view. But personally, I really didn&#039;t like the music (and I have nothing against classic/orchestral music, I loved it in the series). I just think it was a bad choice of music. I think it didn&#039;t show off the musicians well enough.<br />
<br />
The seiyuus were awesome, as usual. Kumiko&#039;s voice is my favourite, it gives so much maturity to the character, and the performance is thrilling!<br />
A new seiyuu really impressed me as well: the one who voiced Kanade. She was so good! She made me love this character, even though she&#039;s a b*tch.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
Kumiko as a senpai is excellent! We spent so long with her looking up to her senpai, now we get to see her being looked up to.<br />
The new students have colorful personalities and some story behind them. Kanade is a cute little bast*rd. Motomu is a shy, cute guy. Satsuki... I&#039;m 99% sure we didn&#039;t get her entire story yet. I&#039;m curious to see more of her. As for Mirei, sadly, she&#039;s useless. Cute, but useless.<br />
As for the old characters... as I said, some important ones get left aside. But the ones who shine are awesome. Natsuki&#039;s relationship with Kanade was great, and Yuuko as the President was great.<br />
<br />
Overall, the characters were really really nice. I even liked Tsukamoto, even though I didn&#039;t really like him in the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
I really loved this movie. It&#039;s a worthy sequel, and as a follow-up, the story makes sense.<br />
It&#039;s also not an ending, despite what the title may make you think. This movie is not a end, nor a beginning, it&#039;s a perfect middle.<br />
<br />
However... I may not want to see more. Because even though this movie didn&#039;t tell  everything, it still closed up everything pretty nicely. I know, it sounds paradoxal, but that&#039;s really how I feel about this movie. I mean, it wrapped up everything the series started, the things that are left open are the stories introduced IN this movie.<br />
For now, I&#039;ll just leave my final judgement open until we get the rest of the story. But as of today, I really loved this movie, and I really advise you watch it if you saw the series (and if you didn&#039;t, watch the series as well!).

    Although a 12-episode series would have been a more satisfying treatment of the material, Chikai no Finale is an entirely worthy addition to the Hibike! Euphonium franchise, successfully carrying through the warmth and kindness of its characters, the focus on growing personally and building sustaining, healthy relationships in the face of adversity, and stunning animation, music and voice acting in a welcome two-hour return to Kitauji High School. (9 / 10)<br />
<br />
(very mild thematic spoilers for the movie possible ahead, movie plot spoilers hopefully scrubbed. SPOILERS FOR THE TV SERIES, WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE WATCHED ALREADY ANYWAY!)<br />
<br />
Chikai no Finale is asked to serve a somewhat strange

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313115">
        purpose, essentially standing in for what, on balance, really should be a 12-episode cour on TV. To review the film, you have to determine how to view it. There is a lot of content here, and it&#039;s clear that significantly more time could have been spent on many characters and themes if the film had two or three times the runtime. That might be pretty obvious, of course. Viewed through the same TV series lens as season 1 and 2 of Hibike! Euphonium, the movie is perhaps a 7 out of 10 at best due to the comparatively limited character development and detail it can achieve; viewed as a true standalone movie, it is maybe only a 4 or 5. Unlike Liz and the Blue Bird, it isn&#039;t even remotely a standalone movie, though, and it certainly is not fair to compare it to a full season of television. So, for what it is, Chikai no Finale is a 9 out of 10.  Its spirit is the same as Hibike! Euphonium seasons 1 and 2: beautiful and inspiring, a fine successor to an affecting series.<br />
<br />
Thematically, threads from the series carry through: hard work, merit, seniority, failure, frustration, purpose. &quot;Why you play&quot; was a key theme in the series, but was then most frequently personified: who you play for. Asuka might be playing for her father; Nozomi and Mizore for each other; Reina for Taki or Kumiko or herself, depending on the day or mood. Purpose of action became a focus by the film&#039;s emotional climax, and had little to do with individual people and more to do with internal drives and motivations. Is playing for someone or something enough? And going beyond Mizore&#039;s doubts about competitions in the series, is it worth it not just to expose yourself to the criticism of the judges, but also, potentially, that of your peers?<br />
<br />
On first viewing the subtitled version of the movie, Kanade seemed an interesting, layered character, and the most worthy addition to a series filled with characters whose depth lent them uncommon realism. (Go figure, the first-year given the most screen time would seem that way.) On a second, dubbed viewing (with a more sensical overall translation), Kanade more strikingly seemed to replace Asuka for Kumiko, both as a friend and also as an erstwhile adversary. In the series, Kumiko faced a few adversaries of this sort: Reina, who prompted Kumiko to start to care deeply about music, competition, and relationships; Kumiko herself and her inability to do very much to help with Mizore&#039;s trauma over Nozomi&#039;s departure and return; and Asuka, who directly forced Kumiko to speak her mind and help others through their troubles by telling them how she felt about them. Kanade, like Asuka, clearly admires Kumiko, but is also frustrated by Kumiko as she moves into a leadership role and adopts a carefully guarded, laboriously positive outlook.<br />
<br />
Initially, I could not imagine giving this higher than an 8, but like the series, this movie rewards a second (or, one imagines, a third) viewing. Certainly, it is too dense with new characters and plot arcs that would have earned three or four episodes in the series but were processed in minutes in the film. One might expect Nozomi and Mizore to garner more screentime given their solos and their relationship&#039;s centrality to the themes of the piece &quot;Liz and the Blue Bird&quot;, but with only two hours to basically stage a season&#039;s worth of content, sidelining them is understandable. Comparisons between &quot;Liz and the Blue Bird&quot; and Kumiko and Reina&#039;s future are perhaps too on-the-nose, but that can pretty easily be forgiven.<br />
<br />
It almost goes without saying that the animation was of an exceedingly high caliber, and the soundtrack was memorable and evocative. Aural themes from the series were carried forward and expanded upon, and underscore tracks built emotional punch highly effectively.  Performance scenes were again a highlight, with a great performance of &quot;Liz and the Blue Bird&quot; headlining them. The film added some 3D zing to the performance, although the strange shot of the ceiling lights spinning in a couple of full circles in the midst of it drew me out of the performance. Fortunately, that odd shot was followed quickly by two thrilling rapid-fire series of shots of performers and notable people in the audience doing... well, the things they are known for doing. Predictably, the oboe and flute parts performed by Mizore and Nozomi were most chill-inducing, although obviously not as emotionally raw as they were in the Liz and the Blue Bird film.<br />
<br />
Per usual, the expression in the Japanese voice acting was simply striking. The dub was well done, also: Kanade was a standout, conveying her positive disposition but never entirely hiding the edge lurking just beneath. It was welcome to not try and replicate Kumiko&#039;s various odd noises in the dub, and she came across as convincingly kind, genuine, funny and intelligent. Asuka was notably playful and charismatic, appropriately delighting and irking Kumiko in fairly equal measure. I thought that Shuuichi was played appropriately, seeming well-meaning but bumbling and rather milquetoast. So, about right. I did not think I would emerge thinking that a dub of the series would be a treat, but darn it, I do think that. Seems unlikely, though.<br />
<br />
The franchise remains comfortably in its welcome space of portraying a group of generally kind and good people dealing with their challenges: growing, failing, improving, and achieving. At its core, Hibike! Euphonium is the story of the development of a warm, good-hearted protagonist faced with realistic conflicts and the unrelentingly believable and inspiring ways she confronts them. While, due largely to time constraints, Kumiko seemed marginally less emotionally deep in this film than she did in the series, especially as compared to Kanade, this remains Kumiko&#039;s story, and it was handled with care and compassion once more in this installment. Kumiko is provided with an array of compelling foils in the series and the film, but none of them is ever cruel. Kanade, like Asuka, can be direct in her criticisms of Kumiko, but in providing them, she provokes Kumiko to take lessons she learned from Reina and Asuka and convert them into thoughtful, kind mentorship. In doing so, she teaches Kanade to always care, to always try, to never fear. How warm it sounds, indeed.<br />
<br />
Watching this movie with no knowledge of the series would be a fruitless, confusing enterprise. Watching the film in context, even if it is forced to try and do too much, provides as much succor for a sometimes cynical and nihilistic period in media as the preceding series did. These are warm, decent, believable people, and there is always a lesson to be drawn, a nostalgic reminiscence to be treasured, or an inspiration to be gleaned from engaging with this franchise. More than anything, Kyoto Animation has proven that regardless of form, they can deliver the soul of Hibike! Euphonium, and I&#039;ll be grateful for however many more heartfelt journeys they&#039;ll give us with Kumiko and her friends.

    *CONTAINS SPOILER*<br />
<br />
This is a sequel movie of &quot;Hibike! Euphonium&quot; as you know ,Oumae Kumiko is the main protagonist of this show,continues her journey on her 2nd year,now that previous 3rd years have left the school,Kumiko has to show what she is capable of without taking any advice from her senpai,specially Asuka.Yes,this is the story of her 2nd year in Kitayuji High,crammed into mere 100 miniutes .<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to consider it&#039;s a movie,it&#039;s pointless to complain about that,specially I didn&#039;t feel any loose plot threads. It stays focused on Kumiko ,how she handles her club and Eupho after Asuka&#039;s departure .Asuka was like a storm in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351785">
        everyone&#039;s life including Kumiko.She grabbed everyone at her time,she was a special entity for everyone,an inspiration both as a club member or as a human being; and now that she is gone,Kumiko is bound to be affected, she learned the most things from Asuka and relied on her most of the time.Now that she is gone,Kumiko has to gain maturity for her ownself.<br />
<br />
Think of this movie as an extension to the previous series,we know how Kumiko is,we know how the other characters felt ,both as individual or as a human on Kumiko .<br />
<br />
S2&#039;s main event was Asuka pointing out Kumiko&#039;s personality traits,it was so important because it&#039;s the story of Kumiko and her progression .She has come around a long time,now has to act like a senpai and has to pull through her juniors.It felt refreshing,as previously Kumiko only received,now she has to deliver .And she delivers,yeah I know some might be bit disappointed because she isn&#039;t the cutest girl acting now,now she thinks on her future,something she probably never considered before.She is slowly maturing,probably her growth isn&#039;t that surprising or noticable,but she has good traits and can overcome her dark side .<br />
<br />
There were two important characters introduced both first year and part of Brass section.They imposed the biggest problems to Kumiko ,as one of them is basically what Kumiko tries to act and another is how Kumiko acts,before meeting Reina and Asuka.They threw the final question to Kumiko ,&quot;Are you happy of what you are? Do you have any regrets ? Don&#039;t you want to change ? Don&#039;t you be more mature?&quot;<br />
Kumiko&#039;s answer is simple,she realised her faults in last season,but now she gives the answer &quot; I know I&#039;m not good now,I have regrets in past but now I don&#039;t want to lose any chance of improving.I will improve and make sure I don&#039;t have any regrets in future&quot; <br />
This movie was like a reply to what Kumiko has been through in her first year.She is more mature now ,and obviously reliable too.<br />
<br />
My only disappointment was how they handled Tsukamoto part,I think he deserved more screentime.Chemistry between Tsukamoto and Kumiko is very good,they can be compatible in future.Best friends,probably not,but surely he is a close friend whom Kumiko can rely .<br />
<br />
The last performance was the best amongst this series,wonder why they didn&#039;t qualify,probably there were better opponents .<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sad now,when season 3 would come I don&#039;t know . I really love Kumiko,and though the story was a bit easy on her,it&#039;s clear who she is ,what she can do or not,and what she can challenge next .<br />
Love Hibike Euphonium ! Goodluck to KyoAni !

    Story:<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have to much to say here. The story felt rushed. I have followed the Hibike series for the past couple of years and have always liked their portrayal of the students navigating through school and the drama of dealing with that is a big draw for the series in general. To me the movie needed to tell a smaller story to rectify this problem, as a less than 2 hour movie is hardly enough time to develop 5 new characters, provide growth for the returning cast, and propel the plot.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Visually the movie looked great, It only had one scene that I remember being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312845">
        a bit below the others but still looked good. I really thought they blended CGI and traditional animation well in the orchestra scene.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Fucking great, will be listening to that song for a while. Also watch liz and the blue bird for more background on the piece.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
I thought there were too many characters that were juggled around. To me it felt like the movie had an identity crisis between wanting to focus on the new characters and keeping the familiar ones around. This left a lot of the drama feeling somewhat hollow as the characters weren&#039;t developed well enough.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I went through a series of highs and lows in the movie. I liked all of the music and the visuals but a lot of the lack luster story and characters stifled some of my enjoyment of the movie overall.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
It was still worth the watch and overall I would rate my experience as positive. As bad as some of the stuff might sound I still liked watching it and thinking back on it furthermore it was a decent fun movie. <br />
<br />
Note:<br />

The bad stuff is easier to talk about in length as the best parts where the visuals and the music.

    Coming off Hibike! Euphonium&#039;s earlier two season anime run, the movie cannot help but feel rushed in comparison to the very well developed series. It is difficult to say that this movie is truly great despite its many strengths precisely because it is meant to be a sequel instead of a standalone work. This means that comparisons are inevitable and frankly warranted in most cases.<br />
<br />
The movie continues to draw on Hibike!&#039;s most obvious strength, its sound, which is still outstanding. For those interested in music, or with a connection like being a part of a concert band themselves, they may find that this point is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366387">
        enough to sell them on both this movie and the series. KyoAni&#039;s art also looks as gorgeous as always. However, where it starts to lag behind compared to its series predecessor is in its characters. While there was sufficient time to really develop their main cast as a two season show, the compressed timeline of the movie leaves me wanting more screen time dedicated to this. It feels like the show could have justified a longer, maybe even beyond two hour, runtime precisely because it is a sequel to a series that is built upon its significant character development.<br />
<br />
The plot of the show generally follows the anime series almost beat for beat. While some might see this as a detriment, I find it to be a neutral factor. The setting of high school necessarily confines where the plot can go to for a realistic drama like Hibike! Euphonium. High School is, in the larger picture, really repeatedly doing the same thing, on the same general schedule, each year until you graduate. Where the difference comes in is in the granular details instead of having a radical change in the major events of each year. This can work in favour of a drama like Hibike! since it forces a focus on the characters instead of plot. Something it was already exceedingly good at. It is not about being thrust into a new situation, which at most is normally the arc of a first-year in high school, but how they negotiate the same or similar challenges again. This time with more experience, better and different relationships, as well as with new responsibilities as older students.<br />
<br />
The difficulty in squeezing this into just a single movie is that we now have to both introduce new characters and develop old ones. The movie accordingly suffers from a rushed characterisation, never really giving attention the new characters deserve, even if they are only part of the supporting cast. By extension, it is never really able to fully realize its potential in showing us the growth of Kumiko and those in her year because their growth is relative to the new characters. While Kumiko takes a more involved role in leading her section and the concert band; the movie never delves very deep into this precisely because this can only be explored by further fleshing out the first years she has to lead. It does make a decent attempt at this. But its rushed execution leaves it lacking the nuance of the series when it handled Kumiko and Asuka&#039;s relationship. The show is stuck in that it rightly cannot afford to cut time from the original cast; but at the same time cannot really develop them further as they cannot show a convincing relationship between them and their juniors without also fleshing out the later. At times it makes it feel more like melodrama instead of an appropriate dramatization of high school. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, it is difficult to say that Hibike!&#039;s third movie is objectively bad. Especially when you consider that it is an adaptation of a light novel. In many ways, it is an excellent film when viewed from that lens and it is the detail of the anime series that has left viewers spoilt. Overall, it is a movie that suffers from its format as a movie instead of as one that functionally does not work because of fundamental reasons in its construction. In isolation, it is definitely a good or even great film that captures the light novel well. It&#039;s strong exploration of the theme of how we deal with failure continues to demonstrate the same strength the anime series had. Yet, it also feels like this movie cannot be consumed on its own, unlike the fantastic and more contained Liz and the Blue Bird. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, it is hard to place this movie because of the many angles it can be viewed from. Watching this without already having seen Hibike! Euphonium season 1 &amp; 2 is almost impossible. Barely any of its run time is dedicated to a refresher, as it should be. Its plot, while still arguably self-contained, is very much not the main point of the show. It is at its heart a continuation of the emotional story of our characters instead of the plot of their school year. However, the anime series which is necessary to have a big stake in the film also establish the expectation of a much slower and detailed movie. This conflict harms the movie from the perspective of both fans and someone watching this alone.<br />
<br />
I suppose the best way to view this film is to probably be conscious of the fact that it will be more rush as a movie. Though still keeping in mind its nature as a light novel adaptation. I think this better helps to frame the film and temper expectations. It leads me to conclude that Chikai no Finale cannot be said to be a great movie. It is certainly well made but objectively not much more than that. If you are a big fan of Hibike! Euphonium like myself, after getting used to the more rapid pacing (possibly through a repeat viewing like I did), it is possible to say this movie is even an 8 out of 10. But definitely not more than that.

    tldr; If you liked Hibike!Euphonium enough to have already watched the first two seasons and the Liz to Aoi Tori movie, you&#039;ll enjoy this one too.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you&#039;ve made it this far down the reviews list, you&#039;ve already read everything I have to say about this one. I just wanted to kind of reiterate that, despite it bringing not a lot of new things to the Hibike!Euphonium formula, that it&#039;s definitely still a great, enjoyable watch. Especially if you try to see it less of a movie and more of a long OVA.<br />
<br />
Art and sound were both phenomenal as always. And it was really a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356077">
        blast watching new characters soundboard off of the established main cast. In particular, I liked how Kumiko began to take steps towards filling Asuka&#039;s shoes.<br />
<br />
Frankly, my issue with this film, as a Hibike!Euphonium fan, is that it wasn&#039;t a whole season. As others have said, this series really benefits from slow build-ups and payoffs, which it did really well in the show. Even so, if another film comes out detailing Kumiko&#039;s exploits as a third-year, I&#039;d enjoy it and watch it all the same; which is why, again, if you need your Hibike!Euphonium fix as much as me, I&#039;d encourage you not to skip out on this one.

    (I&#039;ll keep this spoiler-free for those who haven&#039;t seen it yet)<br />
<br />
The experience I had with this movie was more or less the same as what I got through the first 2 seasons, with the main difference being that the original characters have moved up a grade level, new first years have been introduced, and with those new students come new  pillars for the story to pick up on and use for it&#039;s plot. I think watching the Liz and the Blue Bird movie before this would be helpful as the theme presented in that one carries over to parts of this one, and additionally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312907">
        because this movie pays no attention to Nozomi &amp; Mizore&#039;s characters. When watching this, I was easily reminded of the events of the first two seasons because this movie follows the same main chain of events as past seasons: there is drama occurring between the students and they&#039;re taking up the goal of making it to nationals, but here it engages through alternative routes of key moments we&#039;ve seen before with old and new faces.<br />
<br />
In regards to characters, this movie does an alright job with it. Characters we&#039;ve been introduced to before are showing clear signs of development from when we last saw them before, but of course, with this being a movie, we&#039;re not given much time to feel and care for some of the newer faces and of course we can&#039;t monitor their development as much as we did with former ones. The new first years bring in their own bits of drama with each other and develop some with a few of their senpais, and here is where my main issue with this movie was. We get introduced to new cases of drama from new and returning characters, but we only have so much time to pick up on all the ongoing issues taking place. Character arcs get brought up, but most get partially resolved or get abandoned with so much that has to happen in just 2 hours of runtime. By the plot being developed through a movie a lot of characters and the bonds they gain &amp; develop aren&#039;t able to get much justice, but some are able to have some good moments.<br />
<br />
In regards to other aspects such as the animation, aesthetic, &amp; sound, there wasn&#039;t really much that deviated from the main series because this movie as a whole doesn&#039;t actually feel like new, but simply a continuation of the main series as it should be. Yeah, while it would&#039;ve been nice seeing something that movie feel like it was doing its own thing, there&#039;s nothing wrong with it tracing the steps of the main series.<br />
<br />
In the end, I feel this movie mostly just serves the purpose of bridging a gap between the transition of season 2 to what I hope becomes a confirmed season 3 in the future. I&#039;d say you should give this movie a go since it&#039;s the direct follow up of season 2. All in all, I enjoyed it no differently than I enjoyed the past seasons, and additionally, this movie made me ready to see whatever may happen in the future for Kitauji High School&#039;s concert band.<br />

    Despite being similar to previous seasons of Hibike Euphonium, the movie does not really stand very well on its own and mostly serves to move along the plot of the series. <br />
<br />
The presentation of the movie is very good. The animation is great, the voice acting is still very impressive and the music is very satisfying. It gets handicapped by the rapid pacing and unclear direction of the movie, which results in very short and disjointed scenes.<br />
<br />
The plot of the movie feels very condensed and rushed, resulting in a very flat and unsatisfying viewing experience. It doesn&#039;t have the time to build up the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312846">
        or drama for the satisfying climaxes of the previous seasons. If only it had a few seasons instead of a few hours to tell what could have been a satisfying arc.

    Before I start, I wanna say one thing.<br />
Wrapping a whole year story, a whole big arc, into a one f*ckin&#039; movie, IS A DUMB, DUMB, DUMN DECISION.<br />
<br />
[STORY (5)]<br />
This story really pissed me off. Everything were rushed. The story was rushed. The plot was messy. The romance felt like a fan service only, which it supposed to be whole arc, not just fan service. The romance was terribly rushed. It&#039;s very dumb, stupid, and foolish decision making from KyoAni to wrapped this story into one movie. I&#039;m gonna assume if you&#039;re gonna watch this movie means you already watched the season 1&amp;2. In season 1, they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388026">
        need a ONE WHOLE SEASON to get to the point where they perform at THE LOWEST competition. Season 2 way okay, they wrapped the whole story where they played in Kansai and National competition. BUT THIS ONE IS UNFORGIVABLE. They literally just wrapped A WHOLE YEAR into one movie. This supposed to be a one f*ckin season of series. The drama were rushed. There&#039;s no any exploration for each arc. That makes the climax of each conflict felt forced. There&#039;s no justice for all of the 3rd grader senpai. This story really disrespect all of the 3rd grade senpai. Yuuko, Natsuki, Mizore, Nozomi, etc. Tbh, I&#039;m not a big fan of Kumiko and others. I like Mizore, Nozomi, Natsuki more. So this one is really bothers me. I hate this take on for the story. I&#039;m sure the 3rd season will wrapped the story of them playing in all of three competition in 13 episodes, which I think it&#039;s a bad idea. I&#039;m sure the novel has more to told about the story more than this movie deliver.<br />
<br />
[ART (8)]<br />
Despite how disappointed I am with the story, the art still looked good. The same as season1 and 2.<br />
<br />
[SOUND (8)]<br />
There&#039;s not much I can put to the sound part. One thing I know for sure is they performed the best performance they&#039;ve ever played in this series.<br />
<br />
[CHARACTER (6)]<br />
Still loved the characterization for each character. BUT, for new characters, there&#039;s no any exploration and the development of each character felt really forced and rushed. And we lost so many characterization from supporting role. I barely notice all the senpai.<br />
<br />
[ENJOYMENT (6)]<br />
I was enjoying it despite it has so many flaws. I was about to give it 7/10. But ypu should watch it so you&#039;ll know why I give this 6 for enjoyment.

    Just one word &#039;Rushed&#039;<br />
<br />
<br />
This movie is quite dissapointing for me that watch the other two season (Series) because it was too many things combined into one movie and i think the background of the new characters are too thin also the plot is too rushed, too much time gap between the scenes.<br />
The music is of course not dissapointing and the art is pretty good as expected<br />
basically the down side of this movie is the plot that was too rushed and the new character background are not really told in the movie.<br />
<br />
Also one thing<br />
Can&#039;t wait for the third season i hope it will come soon

    If there’s one thing I can’t stand, it is poncey melodrama, which you usually find in things labelled ‘Drama’, which Hibike was an example of, but they knew how to effectively write dramatic moments, or at least, that was the case until Chikai no Finale, it’s a major disappointment, considering how much better the writing and character was in Liz to Aoi Tori, this time around it appears they’ve reversed on everything that made that good.<br />
<br />
In short, the actual story of Chikai no Finale isn’t one that was particularly necessary, since last time there was a graduation, and that’s usually the end of it, with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349266">
        a coming of age story set in a school a graduation is about as solid a foundation for a conclusive ending as you can ask for, and I felt Hibike did a good job of concluding things. They can always do what K-On did and just have them arrange a trip together or something, that works, but no, they didn’t do that, so that’s the first major problem, the old characters I liked are gone, the one minute long cameo appearance 80% towards the end doesn’t count, Asuka even mentions how she didn’t particularly want to be there, and I never find out why she voluntarily went to a performance she apparently didn’t want to, and instead, there are new ones, that I don’t particularly like. The first one that comes to mind is some chap who is initially an asshole for no reason, and then stops being one for reasons that evidently happened offscreen, it might sound like I’m selling him short, but there’s nothing else to say about him, he doesn’t even go from bad to neutral, his character does a complete 180, and I have no conception of his character in the before or after stage. He doesn’t like being called by his surname, and I noticed towards the end that he shared his surname with the conductor of another school, which would probably be meaningful, but since not one person acknowledged it, I don’t even think he was there when it happened, I can’t say that’s a part of his character. The other two aren’t bad exactly, their development actually happens onscreen and they have understandable reasoning for what may otherwise appear to be malignity, but what’s the point? There’s plenty of background characters already, and not everyone has to be a main character, I just don’t particularly see the rationale in introducing new characters when they’ve got plenty to begin with, especially when Kumiko is still undeniably the protagonist, at least with Liz to Aoi Tori they actually went ahead and made Mizore the main character, but when it comes to the characters, there being new ones who I don’t know much about are the least of my problems.<br />
<br />
In fact, the returning characters have proven themselves to be as capable of egregious behaviour as the old ones. In particular, one scene between Shuuchi and Kumiko. The film opens with a confession from Shuuchi, and we never actually see Kumiko’s reaction to it, not beyond the initial shock (i.e. how she responds to more or less everything), but she seemed to be out with him at a festival of some sort. A bit strange, in the last 2 seasons I didn’t really understand what the two had to do with each other, I didn’t think Kumiko even liked him at all, but now, they appear to be comfortable enough in each other’s company to be running and holding hands, classic sign of affection, and then a minute later he tries to kiss her, but suddenly, Kumiko decides that’s too much, and the only time she speaks to him again is to decide she doesn’t want a relationship at the moment (and probably ever, the title contains the word finale for a reason). Now, as was the case with Socrates, the only thing I understand about women is that I don’t, but even among them, this seems to be a particularly unusual case, does she like him or not? I don’t see much of an explanation for it, the only one being that they wanted to deceive the viewer into thinking the story would go in a particular direction, and then just turning around, but in turn, invalidating what had already been done, if they didn’t want her to be in a relationship with him, they should’ve just not written this part of the story, Shuuichi agrees with her, he thinks their relationship which lasts about a day shouldn’t have happened, so I can’t even accuse them of forcing drama, it’s like stealing someone’s collection of Zimbabwean Dollars, nothing was either gained or lost, so why go through the effort?<br />
<br />
I know I said that I can’t accuse them of forcing drama, but that was the only case for the one particular character dynamic I was speaking of last paragraph, maybe I lied to you, maybe I just subverted your expectations. Chikai no Finale is undeniably packed with forced drama, not really any circumventing that fact, drama here and there can accentuate a story, whoever was in charge of the last 2 seasons understood that, but the drama herein is forced in every sense of it, thrown in for no reason, the character motivations are as bungled as you can get (case in point: kohai decides to throw her audition because if they lose the competition people will think that they lost because the senpai wasn’t playing (does she know what the purpose of an audition is?) and then they decide that both of them will play so it doesn’t matter), and, of course, it’s never really solved, everyone just agrees to stop being mad and then a day later everyone’s forgotten it happened. They didn’t really take any effort to hide the fact it was all an excuse to have our characters run after each other in the rain as they cry and shout at each other.<br />
<br />
But, forgetting that, it’s still KyoAni, it looks as good as ever, soundtrack’s still good, I’ve got kind of mixed feelings about the fact the singular performance of choice was Liz to Aoi Tori, it’s a nice song and all, and a tribute to a previous work, but they just did it, it was their last film, it was called Liz, and that was their performance, kind of a cheap move really, but it works fine and all, the performance itself is probably the weakest one in the series, while I recognise from a directorial standpoint 7 or so minutes of people playing instruments is not the easiest thing to make interesting, while they succeeded previously, not here. An excess of arc shots, unnecessary depth of field, and long shots which are too far away to let you see them play the instruments in any amount of detail, but if you really wanted to look at the entire audience for some reason, then they’ve got you covered. For the most part it’s fine, but that typifies Chikai no Finale – most of the time, it’s fine, but what could be a good experience is let down by lacklustre writing, characterisation which at times has very little connection to the actual way in which people behave, and to top it all off, the grand finale, the one point which I should expect them to get right, is even plagued by its own problems, namely cinematography that had a habit of framing things I’m not interested in seeing. As lazy as it would be, I would have preferred a completely stationary camera that shows the entire Wind Ensemble, a good cinematographer shows me what I want to see, but he didn’t do that, and if I can summarise it in a sentence, it’s that – Chikai no Finale does not show me what I want to see. Very disappointing considering the quality of the previous Hibike titles, and the excellence that was Liz to Aoi Tori, but a franchise without a single bad entry is too much to ask for.

    usually, i&#039;m okay with how melancholic and sentimental hibike! euphonium tends to be. in fact, i like it that way, i like it when teenage girls are portrayed as being very complicated and imperfect characters, and i like how their dynamics are so complex and layered. bring me all the sad and conflicted, i want them. but, here, with kanade and mirei, it was badly done. the most emotional scenes made me roll my eyes, and they felt just so forced and way more dramatic than they earned the right to be. <br />
<br />
but that is just a thing. the biggest fault of the movie is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337743">
        how redundant the story is, how repetitive of what we had already seen before. the new characters didn&#039;t bring absolutely anything new to the series besides kumiko&#039;s role as a leader. all the themes and plots displayed by the new characters were already explored before (and in much more depth and with a lot more of time) in the first and second season of hibike! euphonium, and in liz and the blue bird. there was no need to bring these back. <br />
<br />
i didn&#039;t hate it, and that is mostly because of kumiko. it could be argued that despite kumiko being the protagonist, reina was the focus of the first season and asuka was the focus of the second season. but here, the main narrative was not kanade&#039;s or mirei&#039;s. it was, indeed, kumiko&#039;s. it was her story, it showed us her, how she grew from the first minute of the first episode of the first season to now, what she dealt with and what made her change, how she has become a more mature, wiser person, and how all that turned her into a good leader. <br />
<br />
honestly, chikai no finale feels a lot like a conclusion of the story we had so far. by recycling narratives, symbolism, themes and songs that were already developed and &quot;solved&quot; by the characters in previous seasons and movie, they made sure we realized how the characters (most specifically kumiko) really matured due to everything she has been through with the club and they also made sure to finish for real all possible past plots. now, it seems like both kumiko and the show are ready to take new steps, let the past be the glorious past, and they will be able to confront new challenges and, pretty please, new stories.

    Just back from the Dubbed screening of this new Sound! Euphonium movie; Before the feature itself starts, there&#039;s a quick sub-only 10 minute series recap that honestly I could&#039;ve done without, the memory of Season 1&amp;2 still fresh in my mind.  It was also a little unsettling as I needed to be reassured by theater management this was indeed the dubbed screening that I paid for.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it took a little getting used to hearing Erica Mendez&#039;s voice coming out of Kumiko Omae but her performance grew on me quickly.  I was sad not hearing Cristina Valenzuela reprise Reina but Laura Post did an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313104">
        admirable job for this film. <br />
<br />
The story of this film basically occurs in partially in parallel to the story told in the spinoff movie Liz and the Blue Bird.  The drama of that film is happening somewhere in the background while the events unfold for this movie.<br />
<br />
Mizore &amp; Nozomi do appear on stage for the final concert piece and Mizore&#039;s oboe solo is even more impressive than the version she did in Liz and the Blue Bird, and Nozomi stepped up her flute game enough to accompany her on stage in the competition band.  I&#039;m a little sad these two didn&#039;t actually have any speaking lines for this movie as I found them very sympathetic characters in the series and in Liz and the Blue Bird.  One note of passing interest, they do revert back to Mizore&#039;s original series character design rather than the much more detailed and stylized version used in Liz and the Blue Bird.  I&#039;m guessing this is due to restraints of the animation budget, forcing them to use the simpler TV character design for Mizore since she&#039;s only a supporting background character for this film.<br />
<br />
My personal favorite among the dub cast were some of the new freshman...in particular Kanade Hisaishi voiced by Christine Marie Cabanos which made me so happy.<br />
<br />
My only gripe about the dub would be some of the pronunciation choices....most glaring is calling their school &quot;Kita Oooh Geee&quot; when in Japanese it&#039;s clearly more like &quot;Kih TAU gee&quot;.  I think Liz and the Blue Bird&#039;s dub got it correctly so I don&#039;t understand the divergence for this dub.<br />
<br />
Koh-SAK-uh (Engl.) vs. KOh-suhka (Jp.); I really question when the ADR director doesn&#039;t try to make the actor match the actual Japanese name or surname more closely.  It&#039;s forgivable and only mildly annoying and some dubs are better than others in this respect.<br />
<br />
This story could&#039;ve definitely been stretched out into a complete 3rd season but I still found the movie entertaining.  Definitely be sure to stay after the credits for a special stinger at the end.  I definitely want to see more of Kumiko, Reina, et. al. as they become seniors and move into leadership positions.<br />
<br />
The Kumiko x Reina moments in this movie are so precious and worth the price of admission.  They&#039;re so clearly in love and this shines through every scene they share alone together.  <br />
<br />
Viewers should watch Sound! Euphonium Seasons 1 &amp; 2, then Liz and the Blue Bird and then this movie.  I haven&#039;t watched the other films so thus can&#039;t comment on them.  I&#039;m very happy this got an English dub and remain hopeful maybe someday via Kickstarter or whatever there may yet be an English dub for the entire series.
