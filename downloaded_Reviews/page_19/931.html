    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
My experience of this anime can be summed up by the word &quot;meh&quot;. I went into it hoping for a nice twist on the seven deadly sins being the good guys, and some awesome fight scenes, and ended up sorely disappointed. Sure, the characters are known by their sins, but rather than be actual embodiments of said sins, they were simply granted them as derogatory titles, so they fail to stand out as shounen manga characters in that department.<br />
<br />
The characters don&#039;t undergo any sort of development across the series, and for the most part are bland and boring. Ban is pretty fun

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206286">
        because of his aloof yet silly attitude, and the rest have some decent humor, but this is definitely not a high point of the series.<br />
<br />
The combat was especially mediocre. The fights only ever focus on Meliodas and Ban 99% of the time, with the rest of the sins just acting as accessories. This is especially frustrating after so many of them are hyped up as &#039;the strongest of the deadly sins&#039;, or &#039;the prince of fairies&#039;. I particularly was looking forward to Diane kicking ass, but we only ever really get one awesome moment out of her when she punches through a supposedly unbreakable barrier. The rest of the time she&#039;s either sleeping, 40 miles away, or has a hole punched through her chest and has to act as a damsel in distress. Ugh.<br />
<br />
We do get a couple of good battles in, but the majority only last a couple of seconds, due to the characters&#039; (see: Meliodas and Ban&#039;s) overpoweredness. Only two or three fights really give any true sense of danger, and one of them was ruined for me by how easily Diane went down. But that&#039;s just me.<br />
<br />
I kept watching because I expected a more even playing field eventually, with all of the sins being equally capable, but that unfortunately never happens. Meliodas and Ban are, throughout the anime, just complete male power fantasies, while the rest of the crew just gets swept under the rug. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t hate this anime, but I don&#039;t recommend it. It&#039;s not bad, just decent, and really not worth your time. It lacks any aspect that really stands out, and ultimately just falls flat, lost amidst a sea of better, more entertaining shounen anime.

    The funny thing about sins is that we all have it. As some part of us, there’s a sin in everyone. It’s simple really because they are natural human instincts. That’s hardly what Nanatsu no Taizai is about though. On the surface, the show seems to talk about the sins in their variety. But really, this series is more about a journey, one that has our heroes find those lost Sins. Like a classic adventure, Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins) crafts the extraordinary portrait of how a journey should be in such a fantasy world.<br />
<br />
Let’s get something over with first. This series has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183891">
        the infamous studio known as A-1 Pictures in charge which spells out for some controversy. Known for their other adaptations such as Sword Art Online, Magi, Blue Exorcist, and other related works, they have created some controversy when adapting shounen titles. If you’re thinking adequacy, then you may be right. They are known for butchering up manga material with adaptations such as the latter half of Blue Exorcist and first season of Magi. For Nanatsu no Taizai, the series runs for over 100+ chapters and is still ongoing. The worry may be that the series will be butchered to an extent that will be unsalvageable.  While it does suffer a bit of that, the show does shine in its own ways. It’s by no means an earth breaking adaptation yet still has its compelling ideas bought into light.<br />
<br />
Taking on account of premise, the show should be fairly straightforward. We have a young girl named Elizabeth, who also happens to be the princess of a kingdom. From the first episode, she meets a young boy named Meliodas happily serving to customers at a tavern. It heads into an outlandish route once we learn his true identity as the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins. From here on and out, the duo remarks on a journey to find the remaining Sins. There’s also some explanations regarding the origins of the series in the beginning so all should be made clearly to the audience. Taking for granted, the show is generic from first glance. The world setting the series takes place in is decorated with fantasy gimmicks. Whether it’s one of those ancient fortresses, dungeons, enchanted forests, or even land of the dead, the series doesn’t try to pull anything new from its hat. However, it’s also important to take notice how much they have influence with the events of the series. The show puts on emphasis on some of the settings such as the enchanted forest and its significance. Even past events connected to some of the setting becomes significant in the overall story development. Similarly, most major characters in the series has holds some significance in their roles. The seven deadly sins are perhaps the most infamous examples as the Holy Knights hunts them in an almost cat-and-mouse like story on occasions.<br />
<br />
But when it comes to performance, it’s hard to not take off eyes on our adventurers. Starting with Elizabeth, we can see how gentle she is as a princess yet also brave at heart. Her relationship with the other Sins develops gradually over the course of this show starting with Meliodas. While the two are hardly compatible, there is an innate connection between the two. It also makes us wonder more about them individually as characters. The show makes clever usage of flashbacks to give the Sins some character backgrounds such as with Meliodas, Ban, and King. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t capitalize on all of them and skips some material that are necessary. Still, the characterization is what’s important there and it adapts most of that in its right path except for perhaps Elizabeth. Her character hardly gets any character development and is frustrating to watch. That same also goes for Hawk; the pig who for some reason has the name of a bird despite being incapable of flight. During their journey, they do influence certain outcome of events but the focus on their characters on an individual level is moderate at best. There’s also a decent chemistry between certain characters including the Sins and Holy Knights. Nanatsu no Taizai is about a journey after all and events connecting with characters of the past can influence those in the present and even the future.<br />
<br />
Relationships can also be something to keep an eye on. From strong friendship to romance, the series undertakes ways to flesh them out. However, do not expect top tier adaptation coming from A-1 Pictures. Certain parts are left out that could of made specific relationship seem more realistic. At the same time, we can also see how human some of the characters are. This is demonstrated by the emotions characters show ranging from sorrow, to anger, to regret. It extends to not only the Sins but also the Holy Knights. While not as clearly focused as the Sins, some of them do get character background with examples like Gilthunder. The show makes it clear that some of them are antagonists although there are also changes down the road. Despite all this, the show still has a trend for what shounen series does which usually leads up with predictable outcomes. <br />
<br />
Standing on its feet, the show marks its spot for a fantasy series clearly evidenced by its colorful background. The artwork is well adapted from the manga to illustrate a diverse range of characteristics you would find in any shounen series. Mountain ranges, enchanted forests, and crude dungeons are all fantastically illustrated. The character designs also has variety to give each of them a unique look. Whether it’s Diane’s titanic figure, Ban’s delinquent face, or Gilthunder’s cold expressions, the show is able to create a concrete degree with the variety. I also give praise to the battle scenes as effort can be seen with most of the fights. A few parts will be expected to be left out while the pacing can feel oddball at times. Nonetheless, the show has a good way to balance out its action. Finally, you may be raising your eyebrows on occasions with the fan service. While the show isn’t in the ecchi territory, it does have parts when Meliodas plays with Elizabeth’s skirt like some kid at the candy store or when she is almost completely naked (for legitimate reasons) on more than one occasion. <br />
<br />
Get ready to put on your headphones. Anyone familiar with Hiroyuki Sawano’s work will easily recognize his music style. While it seems generic at first, the soundtrack is clearly and impeccably crafted with strong precision. It coordinates with action scenes well that some of the battles feel like miniature movies. OST also has a decent balance when it comes to comedy and drama. However when it comes to voice adaptations, there are mixed thoughts. Characters such as Meliodas and Elizabeth sound dull and stereotypical. On the other hand, characters like Diane and Ban has a better fit to their personalities. When it comes to voice mannerisms, it’s important to see how their roles fit with the story. Some clearly has what it takes while others falls off short. Similarly, the OP and ED theme songs fits with the show’s gimmicks but is generic to the core when it comes to rhythm.<br />
<br />
As a 2 cour show, it’s easy to say that adapting this series to perfection is an impossible mission. What this show did accomplish though is drawing out the shounen gimmicks to its core. The colorful cast of characters unites a variety of personalities in a classic adventurous journey. And during that journey, we see the challenges our adventurers endears and the obstacles they face. It’s not a complex show really when it comes to the story in the end. Also be aware that this season apparently leaves off some hints for adaptations in the future. With the artwork and soundtrack clearly made to the point and a reasonable premise, it’s all part of this said machine.

    I just wrote a long ass review on this series, and I accidentally drop my laptap and it shut off before I even submitted  it. -_- sigh, I&#039;ll make this one shorter then. if this review felt lacking, its probably because I&#039;m kinda burn out, after putting so much effort in the previous Nanatsu no Taizai review. So let&#039;s begin for a second time now.<br />
<br />
In late 2013, I read about 23 chapters of the manga and I wasn&#039;t impress, don&#039;t know if I was not in a good mood or not. fast forward in 2015, and the anime came, I wasn&#039;t excited at all,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184002">
        until..... lets start with the review. ;)<br />
<br />
Story:7/10. The story revolves around Meliodas and Elizabeth who both goal is to gather the seven deadly sins, although initially there goal for gathering the seven deadly sins is different, in the end their reason for wanting to gather them intertwined with each other. The story follows them as they gather the sins and also clearing their names on false lies about them. while also in combat with the holy nights. The story follows the normal shounen formula but it does tweak it up a little to make this series not be named as just another generic shounen anime.<br />
<br />
Art:8/10.Art looks good, I didn&#039;t really have any problem.<br />
<br />
Sound:8/10. Sawano is the one that compose this, should I say anything else?<br />
<br />
Characters:8/10. The characters are the strongest aspect of this series, The author did a great job in giving flash backs to the characters, each characters have different personality, which makes the series have interesting drama. the characters have depth imo. The author took his time to develop the characters and to give them good flashback stories. we get to know who they were and what were there reason. these characters are the type that would make any series enjoyable even if the story is complete rubbish, that&#039;s how much I enjoy these characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:8/10. I enjoy this series a lot. great action, drama, romance and suspense. it had everything.<br />
<br />
overall:8/10. Overall this series is very good. the anime has completely change my opinion on this series. I think its time to go back to the manga now. ;) anyways thank for reading! sorry if my review felt kinda lacking, I put so much effort in writing the previous one, and to see it go to waste really demoralized me.<br />

    I&#039;ve always wanted to review Nanatsu, but I just couldn&#039;t give myself energy to do it. There&#039;s a lot of wrong things in this piece, and to flesh out each of them is gonna take time - but I really need to. A lot of reviews on MAL just didn&#039;t get to these points, so I&#039;ll have to talk about them myself.<br />
<br />
Nanatsu is your average shonen, with ALL the cliches you can expect to see (overpowered characters, tits, superpowers, power of friendship and shit). But not only shonen cliches, also medieval story cliches: unbelievably unbreakable swords, giant monsters everywhere, kingdoms and knights, games of power

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207233">
        and sexism - A LOT of sexism. I&#039;m actually surprised no one has talked about it until now. But let&#039;s move on and I&#039;ll flesh this out later.<br />
<br />
The story is a huge cliche, but has some interesting ways of don&#039;t letting it show - it is never clear if the seven deadly sins are good, bad or just a bunch of chaotic neutral egoists (much like Genei Ryodan from HxH). The corruption inside the holy knights is shown in a way that makes you think before you judge. Are they really the evil ones, they&#039;re just doing their jobs or are being manipulated?<br />
<br />
Sound and animation: nothing that stands out. Average visuals for a battle shonen, average music for a medieval story. Loved the second ed song, though the video is quite sleepy.<br />
<br />
The fights are beautiful and very well-animated, but quite predictable. The main problem with overpowered characters (for Nanatsu, it means all the cast) is that you&#039;re watching a battle and BOOM someone pulls power off their asses. Ohh no he just got sliced in three BOOM he regenerates with a sacred power that no one talked about until the last 10 seconds. After seing fights like this for 3-4 times, you just start not caring anymore. Everything will get solved in some miraculous way, just leave it be. Soon this character will awake his krakenian demonic rainbow powers and beat everyone&#039;s asses up.<br />
<br />
One of the major problems in Nanatsu is the inconsistency of the characters. Not of THE characters, but of them as a whole: you have some pretty good ones, that really interest you and break some cliches, like Guila, King and Gowther. Many of the charaters have interesting stories and a lot of development as the story goes on. <br />
Then you have your Bucket of Golden Crappy Characters, mainly Meliodas and Elizabeth. Meliodas is a man with the appearance, manners and mentality of a 12-year-old, infinite powers and a broken sword - and you have to put up with him being the main character. Elizabeth is a sack of potatoes with tits. Oh, and she also cries sometimes. Ok, MANY times. Just what you expected from a medieval story. (I&#039;m personally not a fan of this kind of narrative, so keep this in mind while reading... Or not.) This is something you see very much, SO MUCH I can&#039;t stand it anymore. The swordsman with a main character-centered morality and the hot woman who falls in love with him because he is so &quot;brave and heroic&quot;, and not for any other particular reason. Problem with that? Despite being a BIG cliche, no, it&#039;s not a problem. The main problem with Nanatsu comes NOW:<br />
<br />
EVERY EPISODE has some scene where Meliodas harasses Elizabeth - puts his hand under her skirt, inside her pants, on her tits. And he does it like he&#039;s putting a cup of tea in the table. Nothing wrong, I&#039;m just rubbing your breasts. And what does Elizabeth do? Does she go yandere and smack him in the face, like in so many other animes? Does she call for someone to help? Does she accept it, and confesses that she gets turned on by this? No. Of all acceptable (or not) things, she does NOTHING. Elizabeth just asks &quot;sir Meliodas, what are you doing?&quot; &quot;oh I&#039;m just putting my hand there, it&#039;s warm&quot; and gets back to what she was doing before, like she&#039;s not feeling anything at all. Elizabeth exists for the purpose of being harassed for the fanservice. Her character is shallow as a human being and as a woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;OHH NO THERE GOES THE SJW&quot; - no. I personally HATE sjws. Before this being a fault because of the sexism, it is a fault of CHARACTER CONSTRUCTION. Things just don&#039;t work that way. It&#039;s plausible that pigs can talk, that fairies exist in their own kingdom and that a swordsman acts like a horny teenager. It&#039;s NOT plausible that a woman exists just for crying and being harassed like nothing was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH BUT IF YOU STOP WATCHING ANIME BECAUSE OF ECCHI YOU&#039;LL NEVER WATCH ANYTHING BLAHBLAHBLAH&quot;. I love Tenchi Muyo!, because the women there are REAL women, with personality and reactions. I love Prison School, because is ADMITTEDLY an ero comedy, with funny reactions and unbelievable funny situations - with plausible characters for that kind of universe. Nanatsu is pure abusive fanservice. That kind of thing would be understandable in a hentai - a genre with the sole function of hardening certain body parts; though it would still be ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Overall, Nanatsu no Taizai is something I watched as a challenge. A challenge for myself, &quot;can I stand this thing and watch it to the end?&quot;, and a challenge for the series, &quot;does this get better ANYTIME?&quot;. Yes, it gets better in the second half, though rushed, but in the end it felt so hollow. Battles and amazing powers and some deep and interesting characters and a lot of fanservice shit and oh look there&#039;s a lot of better shonen animes with much fewer cliches. <br />
<br />
The main reason behind the hype for Nanatsu must be the superpowers, something that I really don&#039;t care about, despite being a fan of typical shonen. I don&#039;t really see any other reason for someone to watch this, it&#039;s just... An extremely whatever anime. Does this sentence make sense? Well, but that&#039;s it.

    [First review] [bad english]<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
Like every cliché shounen, The Seven Deadly Sins has a mediocre and linear story, that is only used to justify fanservice and nonsense fights. The plot follows Meliodas, a very dumb and innocent dude (despite he always abuse his friend Elizabeth and, sometimes, turns into a demon), who is unjustifiably determined to help the princess that he knew 2 seconds ago. <br />
It&#039;s basically a generic copy of Fullmetal Alchemist, but one thousand times worse.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
The animation is fine, but the trait is just terrible, and the character design is so badly done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
The sound composition is, ultimately, just okay. It&#039;s fundamentally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249925">
        common teenager J-Rock, and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
Nanatsu No Taizai&#039;s characters are quite one-dimensional, although they are projected to be great. Meliodas is a pathetically cliché shounen protagonist, following Dragon Ball Z and Naruto molds. Elizabeth is the Lucy Heartfilia of the show, an unbearable girl who is only used to make fanservice scenes and incite the virgin jerk-offers to search for hentai. Other characters are equally terrible, as exemple, Ban is just pure pose, and divinized by fans only for being the greedy anti-hero (ps: he is the greed, but gives up of immortality, because a girl asked for him give up).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
With all these defects, it&#039;s hard to say that something in the show is enjoyable. The Seven Deadly Sins falls in all the aspects of a good show, it&#039;s very uncomfortable to watch, mainly because EVERY episode has at least one rape scene.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10<br />
The conclusion is: Nanatsu no Taizai is the most sexist non-hentai anime and the worst battle shounen ever made, even worse than 5-minutes YouTube homemade animations.

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why many people find this anime so good when it&#039;s really not.<br />
The anime gives us first the introduction of the characters. It was ok, I guess...Still, I was annoyed at the character of Meliodas. Why? Because he is a fucking sexual harasser with the girl who joins him: Elizabeth. Touching her boobs and ass and looking at her panties... Is that supposed to be funny? Because I&#039;d find it rather disgusting than something for laughs. Besides that, the other characters were very neutral for me, but this Gowther guy who appears almost at the last which had a mysterious aura was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212926">
        kind of interesting like  you want to know more about him and the pig makes an exeption as the second one being a sympathethic character who cares about his friends and is always protecting the useless Elizabeth from Meliodas. And you can&#039;t deny me the fact that Elizabeth isn&#039;t useless because she is. She doesn&#039;t do anything in the series. Crying, shouting Meliodas&#039;s name to save her and letting herself be touched by him doesn&#039;t mean anything of utility for me. She is the typical useless girl who everyone likes because she is so nice and pasive. Nice.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say the anime is sexist because it isn&#039;t. Women fights as we see one of our main protagonist: Dianne, yeah, she is strong and not weak like Elizabeth. There is a girl which represents the typical stereotype of characters that never opens their eyes that does fight as well as the other with white hair who seems to have an interest in Ban. I liked the girl that I mentioned in the last since she had very brave spirit. The other is very meh to me but at least she does something.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the plot, there isn&#039;t much to say about it since I didn&#039;t understand a shit. Like I mentioned first, we have the characters introduction, some funny scenes and then there is this main plot. Everything happens so fast and there is all this fights all of a sudden. I only understood that someone whichidontrememberwho kidnapped Elizabeth and everyone has to save her<br />
...Wow, we never saw that before in a history, sooo original! <br />
<br />
The end was good I guess....It wasn&#039;t so bad done like the main plot. We see Elizabeth with her sisters and her father in the palace when Meliodas with all the others deadly sins came to tell her if she wants to join them one more time in their adventures. She accepts and goes with them. At least it wasn&#039;t a sad drama but it didn&#039;t gave me motivation to follow the manga or be excited for a second season.<br />
<br />
Talking about the manga, I made some research after watching the anime and there were many complains since my percepction seems to be right about how the direction of the plot has happened. The manga takes its time to explain everything not like the anime which everything happens all of a sudden, characters and relationships appears out of nowhere and you don&#039;t understand what the hell is going on.<br />
And if you asked me if I was sad with the dead of King&#039;s friend? No, I wasn&#039;t. The part is terrible done and of course, I didn&#039;t understand it very well to feel something emotional. <br />
I guess I laughed a bit with the pig being protective with the crying girl? But that was all the emotion I had rather than feeling kind of bored and asking myself what was happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the seven deadly sins was a bad anime for me. I didn&#039;t see anything out of common and I haven&#039;t mentioned this before but this characters are supposed to be deadly sins...Why the hell didn&#039;t they focused more on that instead of putting useless and predictable fights which nobody cares? It could have been way more interesting. I mean come on, I realized they represented the deadly sins after a friend told me so I didn&#039;t took notice which is a pity because the anime could have been way better. <br />
So that&#039;s it, a fantasy anime that doesn&#039;t had much to apport only kind of fan service I guess , pretty colours and putting figths as we&#039;re supposed to be interested in that. Fights are good in shounen animes when the plot and what is happening according to the situation is well executed.

    Nanatsu no Taizai has been an anime that despite being a typical shounen has little to no complaints (that&#039;s what I am seeing) so I expected it to be at least decent. Oh boy, even Fairy Tail is better.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
<br />
A typical shounen anime overloaded with pointless fanservice. The anime started with finding the remaining members of the sins then a random fight festival which were both a pain to watch because its too generic. Then we have the next arc dedicated to finding Gowther which is kinda ok. The only decent part of the show. After that the absolute shitshow of a finale start. A

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312608">
        generic villain fighting against a set of overpowered bums. This said villain has too little build up for me to sympathize to him and his half-assed motives. Is it entertaining to watch? Never, not a second. One of the most boring finales ever. <br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
<br />
Their interactions are what ruined this show. Cringe dialogue every time someone talks then pointless fanservice then boom that&#039;s one scene. The amnesia subplot of Diane is also annoying and pointless. This one-dimensional, carboard cut out characters are all just there for fanservice.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
<br />
One of the most cringiest anime to ever exist. There are point of cringiness in this anime that even Fairy Tail has not yet reached. Eww.

    Shounen is a tricky genre. Too often, plot is abandoned for the sake of showcasing all of the powers and techniques of the hero, and knowing this, I was very reluctant to get into Nanatsu no Taizai. Having taken the plunge several weeks after the show&#039;s original premier, I am incredibly pleased with what I ended up with.<br />
<br />
Nanatsu no Taizai does follow the same basic shounen formula: one powerful force butts heads against another, everyone is naming their attacks before they use them, a useless female companion appears--yet, these rough edges are given their time to develop into something likable and actually compelling to watch.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183942">
        story has excellent pacing in that it sticks to the typical format of battle after battle while still gradually introducing each of the main characters and forwarding the plot. With each few segments, the view gains time to grow accustom to each of the Deadly Sins themselves, and find more to them than simply different battle styles. As well, the motivation for both the protagonists&#039; and antagonists&#039; sides were plainly present; I was especially pleased at the motivation for the antagonists, as that is one such point that is so often vague and underdeveloped.<br />
Toward the very end, elements from both opposing sides came together for a satisfying conclusion, and watching everyone&#039;s goal form into one single objective was a delightful way to conclude the relations between the two sides.<br />
It was also pleasing to see that the series knew when to push fanservice down a few pegs in order to complete the story, rather than spoil the climax with the inclusion of the humorous bits of female lead at the beginning. It was nice to see the focus shift, the story taking precedence. <br />
This is not to say any attempts at lightheartedness are abandoned; they find their spotlight for each of the characters, and not just the main hero.<br />
<br />
Through this, equality was provided; it wasn&#039;t just the main Sin, Meliodas, that got the spotlight. Attention was paid to the feelings and relations between the other Sins, and screen time was generously given to explain their pasts, while not completely disconnecting from the main plot. While somewhat cliche at times, for lack of a better phrase, I gave a damn about the cast. <br />
<br />
Everything in the show was also given the helpful support of clean art and magnificent sound. The selection of voices was very fitting for each character, emotions in-story being very well conveyed. <br />
The color choices were bright and the animation harbored the obviousness of a team that knew what they were doing. <br />
<br />
Overall, I suppose this is one of those series that&#039;s popular for a reason, but more of a reason that useless moe or excessive showing off. Not being a particularly big action aficionado myself, I am unsure of whether or not my enjoyment stems from the excitement of branching out from slice of life once in a while, but I am glad I did. Nanatsu no Taizai earns its popularity, and I would not be upset at the release of another season, so long as those at the helm take careful care to put as much attention to making it more than basic shounen just as they did with these first 24 episodes.

    This show has all the makings of something great but never delivers. You have good quality animation, a group of characters with various skills and personalities that you will surely find your favorite. Action and abilities, and even some twist on historical and mythical figures in place. Even has some fan service and good humor and starts off with a captivating first episode.Yet it all feels like a whole bunch on stuff thrown together with no clear direction.<br />
<br />
The universe isn&#039;t explained well enough or provides clarity. You have giants, humans, demons, fairies, immortals, holy knights, talking pigs etc etc.  It&#039;s as if any creature

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203527">
        they wanted to exists in this realm does. This would be ok if the story did better with making everything mesh.  It just feels as if things don&#039;t make sense, we have multiple main characters whose appearances change drastically with little explanation.<br />
<br />
The fighting also leaves a lot to be desired. Fights are quick and are more a display of skill than an actual engaging back and forth.  Skills can also seem quite random. The overall lack of  consistency can make it difficult to let the anime capture you. The show isn&#039;t bad it&#039;s just missing a polish to make it a great show, you may watch it and love it , but chances are you will watch keep asking yourself should you continue or should you drop it.

    The story of how I came into watching Nanatsu no Taizai (or Seven Deadly Sins, whichever do you prefer to call it) is rather an odd one. The series isn&#039;t exactly on my anime watchlist back when it aired on Fall 2014, and I only watched it when I noticed Animax channel in my region began airing the series during winter. Considering the series seems like a good harmless shonen fun, I decided to finally watch it since I don&#039;t watch that much anime in that season. And it is quite good fun shonen, although it takes a while to get there.<br />
<br />
The series story are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186225">
        pretty much what it says in the synopsis and follow the standard &#039;gather comrade in arms to overthrow evil ruler&#039; plot (with some twist along the way of course). In a way, it make sense to see why Nanatsu&#039;s appealing to its fans due to the series old school JRPG-esque setting and plot (which is rather refreshing personally), but infused it with enough shonen action trope to make itself distinguishable. The reminiscence, however, doesn&#039;t stop there, with both the artstyle and character design are noticeably influenced by Akira Toriyama&#039;s ,who also did the character design for JRPG such as the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger.<br />
<br />
Nanatsu start quite weakly for the first few episodes with, at the time main characters, Meliodas and Elizabeth, aren&#039;t quite an engaging characters with the former being a frank, shameless, and brave pervert, while the latter being the stereotypical weak kind-hearted princess with aren&#039;t much complexity. It doesn&#039;t helped either the series humor are mostly consist of Elizabeth being groped by Meliodas. Fortunately, the series picked itself up when the rest (well, the majority of them anyway) of the Nanatsu no Taizai are introduced. There&#039;s Diane, a cheerful giantess who has a massive crush on Meliodas. Ban, an undead thief who&#039;s also a somewhat loveable ass. King, a fairy with a crush on Diane, and also the general straightman and the &#039;sensible&#039; one of the group. And Gowther, who&#039;s practically a stoic robot with a human skin.<br />
<br />
The main cast dynamics are definitely the series main core strength. While the Nanatsu crew aren&#039;t exactly colorful, each of them had a solid personality and flaws which allows all of them to bounce off well with each other. And with the establishment that the Nanatsu crew are a very strong warriors, it also allows for a quite funny slapstick humor. The rest of the cast, both on the holy knights side and the non affiliated one, also fares pretty well. The holy knights in particular, have a distinguishable personality and also different sides to each of them which prevents them from becoming one dimensional.<br />
<br />
Also, special mention for the series composition, done by Shotaro Suga (Oregairu, Uchouten Kazoku). Each scenes and plot beats flows pretty nicely and the overarching story also progressed quite quickly with almost no meandering around or pointless episodes without feeling its rushed (although it does feels rushed at times). For example, during the tournament arc, one episode literally covers three fights. But each fight are short enough so it doesn&#039;t worn out its welcome, but long enough to be entertaining and meaty.<br />
<br />
As for the fights themselves, they&#039;re pretty entertaining spectacle with dynamic direction and some nice animation. Each of the characters have their own core magic skill and moves set that derives itself from it. While the core magic are simple in nature, they bounced off well without one power overwhelming with the other. Few of the skills derivatives and the way it work in conjunction with their weapon are also quite creative. One character has the core skill of mind invasion, which allows him to trapped his enemy in an illusion, rewrite their memories temporarily and even trigger a nightmare inside. And since he channel his power through a bow, he can do it in long range.<br />
<br />
On the technical front, Nanatsu had a generally solid aesthetic with a variety of colors and distinct character design, but unfortunately it&#039;s bog down by a rather generic medieval fantasy background and landscape (with one exception, that is the land of the dead). The music, done by Hiroyuki Sawano, features an appropriate range of upbeat battle music with some classic medieval instruments  to enhance the atmosphere. But compare to Sawano&#039;s previous soundtrack work such as Kill la Kill and Attack on Titan, the music in Nanatsu are surprisingly rather tame. While it did fit the mood and the tone of the series, if I hadn&#039;t know beforehand that Sawano&#039;s in charge of the music, I wouldn&#039;t even recognized who&#039;s the music composer, due to the lack of his usually more grandeur and bombastic pieces.<br />
<br />
There are, however, some niggling issues I had with the series. Asides from the aforementioned weak first few episodes and the show use of Meliodas perverted action toward Elizabeth as a recurring gag, the problem is on the way the series handle few of the character&#039;s arc, in particular, Diane and Ban&#039;s. During the final arc, Diane, out of nowhere, suddenly have loneliness because of her being a Giant. The problem with this is on the fact that Diane, up until that point, had been characterized as a cheerful girl who has a crush on Meliodas. Loneliness has never been something of a problem for her in the earllier episodes. While the series does dedicated an episode behind this later on, it still felt out of place for her character because of the lack of foreshadowing she had this problem and the lack of build up. The problem with Ban&#039;s are, quite interestingly, the exact opposite of Diane&#039;s problem. His flaws and problems are something that&#039;s already been established and explored right after he joins the crew, but it falls short on its conclusion.<br />
<br />
So, that&#039;s pretty much Nanatsu no Taizai. You have to stuck up for the first few episodes, past that, and what you have, is a pretty entertaining shonen fantasy action with fun characters and some nice battles.

    (This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
Everybody sins. You and me, friends and family, neighbors and strangers; nobody is averse to acting sinful. The severity, though, changes depending on the circumstance: a rogue thought doesn’t do much harm nor does a little bit of desire. But other, more malicious movements can harbor emotions with greater intent to maim. This is where atonement comes into play. For while sinning is bad, it’s the good we do to make up for our grievances that truly matters. Nanatsu no Taizai takes this idea to heart, crafting an anime that needs no forgiveness.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Taizai begins innocently enough.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189049">
        Elizabeth Liones visits a local pub where Meliodas, the now infamous “Dragon’s Sin of Wrath” resides. Seeking his and the other Sins’ aide in helping not only her father but also the kingdom from encroaching civil doom, Elizabeth and Meliodas embark on a journey to find the other “legendary warriors” – The Seven Deadly Sins.<br />
<br />
The word “journey” here is important, because that’s what this is. “It’s not the destination that’s vital, but the journey” is something that’s often said to highlight the experience undergone while attempting to reach that ultimate, final goal. And this couldn’t be truer with Taizai. The narrative is, at first glance, a “fetch quest.” Elizabeth needs the combined might of the Sins in order to vanquish the evil that threatens her family and homeland. So what’s initially presented is just that – the two roam the countryside, picking up information and traversing lands in order to find the mightiest heroes to ever live. But already, the proverb previously picked comes through, because the events are allowed to naturally unfold as these smaller, mini achievements are carried out. And this is due to the Sins being vastly overpowered compared to everyone else: Meliodas is impossibly strong, Ban is literally immortal, Diane controls the Earth itself, etc. More specifically, the outcomes that our characters will succeed is a given, but it’s the show’s ability to always keep such victory just out of reach, until the last possible second, that provides every scenario that they encounter with the same feelings of initial hope, followed by rocky despair, and eventual elation.<br />
<br />
These situations are further amped by the incredible diversity that they always contain. The nature of the world presents “Holy Knights,” each with his or her own special weapon or set of abilities that makes that person entirely unique – the Sins are the same way, just in a league of their own. So every fight, battle, skirmish, duel, or conflict is never the same; new abilities are constantly shown and unique characters are consistently introduced. And even when the same characters and their powers appear more than once, not only do they use their abilities in combination with one another but it gives the show the opportunity to have cast members interact with each other where they had never done so before. This idea also highlights another of Taizai’s strengths: character exploration. The overarching tale is explained and investigated through much of the side characters and the battles that take place, but the anime also takes its time in providing many of the people showcased with both meaningful and purposeful backstory. Ban’s depressing reality, King’s horror-filled past, and even bits of Meliodas’s mysterious upbringing are given. Yet it’s not just the mains; people like Gilthunder, Guila, Dreyfus, and many others have their motivations not just given but applied to the scenarios at hand, allowing for the narrative to contain plot points that are both worthwhile and connected to everything else that’s going on. In other words, the characters and their stories form one, complete adventure.<br />
<br />
Even after all this, Taizai doesn’t stop, for it manages to cover almost all of its bases when it comes to telling not just a complete tale but a fulfilling one, too. The journey they originally began actually ends. There are minor fragments from this original quest that still need answers, but these are more related to characterization and development as opposed to having incomplete storytelling. At the same time, a new journey begins. And not just right before the final few scenes of the show; it’s introduced much earlier and it maintains that aforementioned relevancy by being used with the current narrative. Everything also ends up “as it should.” The anime had always been designed with happiness in mind: crazy action sequences, cute and fun comedy, characters to root for, etc. So watching as all of the good guys band together to take out the ultimate evil while providing the audience with a satisfying outcome for everyone involved gave the journey a nice sense of closure.<br />
<br />
And just for good measure, Taizai creates a thematic foothold, one that was given in the introduction: the notion of atonement. People are capable of doing some rather vile things. Robbery, manipulation, murder, kidnapping, sexual harassment; or even less extreme cases such as having jealousy, insulting another, or simply being rude. Everybody sins, but it’s not the sinning that’s important, but the good one does to make up for the wrongs accrued that makes the difference. Meliodas protects Elizabeth with all his heart to make up for his failing on Liz, King fights for this kingdom because he couldn’t fight for his, and Ban lives life to the fullest because the woman that gave it to him never had the chance. And again, the side characters exemplify this as well. Using the same examples: Gilthunder chooses to become a roaming helper, Guila has only her younger brother in mind to the point of becoming a “traitor,” and Dreyfus squares off against his best friend. So while everyone in the show does something that one would consider bad, it’s what they do to atone for their sins, the good that they do, that matters most.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Taizai’s art is quite splendid to look at, mostly because of how colorful everything generally is. And not just with the characters – the world itself shifts in tone and mood to match the situations on-hand, with the color palate morphing accordingly. The same goes for the move-sets – it’s an explosion of color at every turn. The fight choreography is also handled quite well, with the camera making sure both the big and the small actions are always front and center. For an added sense of coolness, the abilities are always given names, followed by a textual representation surrounding them to emphasize just how awesome the power, and subsequently the art, really is. Beyond this, the locations are varied, the lighting is appropriate, and the abilities shown are provided flashes, flairs, and focus to match their overall high sense of power.<br />
<br />
The character designs are also some of the strongest in the medium. Elizabeth in particular is incredibly well-designed: her intentionally concealing hair, cute, frilly, pink dress with ribbon, short skirt, one-legged tights, mismatched shoes, and teal eyes to match her teal earrings easily demonstrate how unique every character is drawn. Ban’s spiky hair with red-leather vest and pants, King’s favorite cloak and pillow to go with his transformations, Gowther’s somewhat androgynous appearance, and literally every knight having their own distinct style makes the characters look like the over-the-top parts they play.<br />
<br />
In typical Taizai fashion, actual animation is always above average. Character movements are fluid, the abilities are never not going off, and the fights are tense from start to finish due to the near constant action that occurs. Be it a bit of blinking, hair moving, or watching as dark flames engulf the surroundings in waves, the anime refuses to let up when it comes to animation.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
There are a lot of characters within Taizai, and many of them see some interesting characterization and a bit of development. While some of them could have seen a bit more – Meliodas, Diane, and Gowther, to be specific – what was given is still a healthy dose. Mostly because it wasn’t just the main characters that maintained focus but the side characters did, as well.<br />
<br />
One of the better characters offered by the anime was Ban. Ban is the “Fox’s Sin of Greed,” and he is as carefree as can possibly be. His behavior is somewhat aloof, with him coming off as entirely rude and unsympathetic to anyone he converses with. Even towards Meliodas, who is not only his captain but also his closest friend. His snarky attitude and mean spirit should make him hard to like, but it’s his very uncaring nature that allows him to be as entertaining as he is, for he holds no remorse towards anyone. Save for one. Before acquiring his immortality, he was a thief looking to drink from the “Fountain of Youth.” There, he befriended a fairy girl named Elaine, which eventually turned into love. Unfortunately, outside influences cause her to sacrifice herself to save Ban, granting him the power he had initially sought but no longer wanted. Living forever, but not having that person who is dearest to you, unable to have and to hold for the rest of your days, is one hell of an atonement. So Ban’s position becomes clear: he doesn’t get close to anyone because he doesn’t want to have those same feelings of loss again. But even if he may not be kind towards others outright, his intentions are always founded on being there for the people that matter most, lending credit to the notion that Ban isn’t so greedy after all.<br />
<br />
Helbram is an interesting individual for a variety of reasons. He not only has his own “fake” persona like his best friend King, but his background is told in a roundabout way – through King’s recollection of the past. And what is given is a kindhearted fairy who was infinitely intrigued by the humans of the land. Sadly, some of these humans weren’t as good as he thought them to be; witnessing the mutilation of his fairy brethren – men, women, and children alike – he dips into insanity. Similar to Ban, he lives his life in an unbearable fashion – listening to the sounds of tearing wings and desperate screams, forcing him to kill the people he thought he loved, to both “get back” at them and to relieve him of the nightmares he has lived with for centuries. While King ends his best friend’s suffering, Helbram is reincarnated through magic twice-over as a sort of zombie with no brain and a fairy with no heart. He’s a tragic character whose third death at King’s hands not only (finally) saves him, but proves that sometimes, one’s atonement is cruelly massive.<br />
<br />
As a final look into the cast, Elizabeth acts as a foil to everyone; comparing them to her makes it easy to see how sinful everyone is. She is the princess, the “damsel in distress,” and so she’s initially perceived as being very weak. But she’s in fact the strongest in the show. Not just because she got herself hurt one time by sneakily grabbing that bell, or allowing herself to be kidnapped to save Meliodas, or even using her druidic powers to heal everyone and the land. She’s the strongest because, out of the entire cast, she’s the only person who doesn’t sin. This seems to go against the earlier discussion, but that’s precisely the point. She’s caring, doting, and kind; she’s an absolutely beautiful person both inside and out. So in this world where everyone around her does something bad, she’s the lone outlier, because all she ever does is good.<br />
<br />
This dichotomy of hers – being “weak” when she is actually the “strongest” – is something that is seen with each of the Sins as well. Meliodas is the “Dragon’s Sin of Wrath,” yet he is the nicest guy in the world, both to Elizabeth and the people. Diane is the “Snake’s Sin of Envy,” yet her giant-like status is something she comes to accept. And Gowther is the “Goat’s Sin of Lust,” yet he’s purely logical, calculable, and objective in his dealings, with no emotions whatsoever let alone desire. The other Sins can be described as such, but what’s most important is what this represents for Elizabeth, the Sins, and people in general: that nobody should be defined by a single facet. In other words, someone shouldn’t just be known for a single sin committed, for we are all more complex than at first understood.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening themes are, like the majority of Taizai, top-notch in their execution. The first OP has a very adventurous feel to it, with the singing and beat being extremely catchy to listen to. It maintains a not-too-hopeful yet not-too-melancholic vibe about it, with the blend of both happiness and sadness capturing the happenings of the anime itself quite nicely. The second OP opts to go entirely optimistic. The lyrics aren’t just easy to sing along with, but also hold relevancy to the themes: “the pain and the pleasure all come together” is another way to phrase how sin and atonement go hand-in-hand.<br />
<br />
The ending themes follow the same trend. The first ED just oozes fun, with its fast beat, hard guitar, and its all-over-the-place lyrics. It really does make you “fly high” when one sits down and jams out to it. The second ED goes in the completely opposite direction of its counterpart and everything else. The vocalist gives a strong performance, bringing about a lot of power in her voice where the instruments lean towards a “softer” melody. It’s almost depressing, but not in the sense that something bad has gone down, but rather that something good has finally come to an end.<br />
<br />
Hiroyuki Sawana does it again, bringing about an original soundtrack that fits the mood, contains his signature style, and even has some tracks that are nice to listen to outside of the show itself. “Dragonsin” is one of the best pieces, with the continuous violins, distinct accordion, and rising tone pumping one’s adrenaline. “Erionesu” is played during those emotional moments, with the backup drums providing that extra kick. And “Kenkamatsuri” with its orchestral composition and choir brings the epic feeling that Taizai employs in droves.<br />
<br />
The voice acting for the anime is always above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Sora Amamiya as Elizabeth for her consistent and perfect princess voice, Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Ban for his nonchalant way of speaking, Misaki Kuno as Hawk for her very impressive uniqueness she brought to the pig, and Yuuhei Takagi as Gowther for performing as the emotionless mind-freak in his first major role. Realistically, though, everyone did a splendid job.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Part of what made this show so much fun to watch was due in part to both the characters’ individual personalities and the interactions they had between each other. Elizabeth’s constant cuteness, Meliodas always kicking butt, and Gowther’s weird yet endearing way of acting managed to make me smile every single time. Diane’s crush on the captain but obliviousness to the leader of the fairies, Ban messing with King at every turn, Elizabeth patiently putting up with Meliodas’s “flirting;” the cast have this dynamic connection that portrays them as the tight-knit group that they are. Elizabeth is my favorite, but Meliodas, Diane, Ban, Gowther, King, and Hawk are right alongside her, because everyone is just so easily likable from the moment they first appear on-screen.<br />
<br />
The hilarity is well-done, as are the battles that take place. The wonderful animation, varying abilities, and grand scale of it all makes each fight just as exciting as the last. Ban versus Meliodas in the tiny village as well as Meliodas versus Gilthunder and Hendrickson in the royal capital were crazy to watch, and are excellent examples of what the anime has to offer in the action department. Despite all of this – the comedy and the clashes – this isn’t an anime that I found myself absolutely attached to, but there was never a dull moment throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Nanatsu no Taizai is an anime with crisp visuals and killer music; a stellar story and fun-loving characters; and enough entertainment to make even the saddest person smile with glee. It’s no stretch of the imagination to say that “The Seven Deadly Sins” aren’t just deadly: they’re amazing.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Great, all about the journey, with constantly unique scenarios, purposeful character exploration, a complete narrative, and themes of sin and atonement<br />
<br />
Animation: Great, colorful and fight-focused art style, incredible character designs, and above average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, while Meliodas and a few others needed a bit more focus, Ban, Helbram, Elizabeth, and the rest of the cast received more than enough to exemplify atonement and complexity<br />
<br />
Sound: Great, great first OP, great second OP, great first ED, good second ED, nice soundtrack, above average VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good, endearing characters, nice comedy, and high-action battles leave one grinning ear-to-ear<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    A group of knights have overthrown the kingdom and started an uproar, dubbed as the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins.&quot; Soon, they all suddenly disappeared and the people rejoiced over their supposed defeat. Ten years later, the kingdom is overflowing with pride, yet a hidden darkness lies within as a girl comes up to a bar...<br />
<br />
&quot;Nanatsu no Taizai&quot; or &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; is a recent anime released by A-1 Pictures that illustrate the adventures of a certain group against a kingdom deemed corrupt. That&#039;s basically it in a nutshell, so here is my review of this series! <br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
The story basically follows a young girl named

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184130">
        &quot;Elizabeth&quot; who seeks out to search the Deadly Sins for a certain purpose. And from then on it&#039;s load of adventures and especially action in forms of duels, battles, etc. Very simple plot line with add-on gags of humour and feels trip. Subplots don&#039;t tend to overtake it. The story is enjoyable and easy to follow.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
To be terribly honest, the cover art did not appeal to me at first glance. It seemed quite outdated and doesn&#039;t fit the name. However, it all changes when I watched the first episode. The art is like that to fit the setting (which is good) and the action scenes were epic and simple. Perfect amount of flash and bash and detailed frames. Not the best, but beautiful nevertheless.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Sound is not a dominant part of The Seven Deadly Sins as its OSTs are quite adequate and don&#039;t stand out too much. However, I do take a BIG liking to the opening &quot;Netsujou no Spectrum&quot; since it fits it really perfectly, as well as the ED &quot;7 -seven&quot; by FLOW X GRANRODEO. OP and Ed fit and I hope it&#039;ll stay that way. I wish for more prismatic OSTs though.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
From an anime called the Seven Deadly Sins, you&#039;d expect the lead to be some dark angel and the cast to be dark demons with a hint of goth and black. Nanatsu no Taizai does not follow this thought but the characters are the most amazing I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime of the sorts. The cast is not very big, but the development of backstories is amazing, adding depth. Designs and personalities are very well done!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
I particularly look forward to every episode because every episode&#039;s end always has some cliffhanger of sorts that prompts you to watch the next one. Each episode is unpredictable as the balance of action and humour isn&#039;t obvious. Still, every episode is unique and has their own flair.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
This anime is something I&#039;ve been waiting for since last season. Despite being disappointed by the preview cover art, it was quickly reversed as I watched it more. I recommend this anime to the general crowd as well as those who enjoy reading the manga (Yes it has a manga!) and people who enjoy action/adventure. I hope you enjoy it!

    Mainstream media loves the Seven Deadly Sins -- and no I&#039;m just not talking about this anime. Whether its Re:Zero, Full Metal Alchemist or the popular 1995 movie Se7en, we can&#039;t seem to leave our fascination with the seven sins alone. And it&#039;s manifested itself in wonderfully in this anime, the Seven Deadly Sins. <br />
<br />
I will be honest though. Nanatsu no Taizai is a bit like a parody of mainstream shounen anime. And I love it for that, whether its intentional or not. It&#039;s a bit like a watered down, medieval fantasy version of Bleach that could almost be a One Punch Man if it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376808">
        tried. Instead, we get something in the middle. <br />
<br />
I give it a refreshing 8/10, and the only thing holding back my favorite sins is quite unfortunately, just the animation and production quality of this anime series. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We finally get an anime set in a medieval fantasy world without the dark gritty seinen flair of Berserk or Vinland Saga. Nanatsu no Taizai is a story that evolves beautifully beyond the mundane good-guy vs bad-guy cliche. It make a beautiful statement that there is no &#039;good&#039; and that there is no &#039;bad&#039;. Everybody is flawed and selfish in their own way, and this becomes more and more apparent as the series progresses into the 2nd and 3rd seasons. Season 1 only gives you a glimpse into the world beyond humans and makes you yearn to learn more about the demons that inhabited this world in the past. There are twists and turns in nearly every episode, and while they all fall into the usual tropes, it is oddly satisfying to watch, if you can stomach some of the weaker animation and production quality that went into the making of this anime. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Like most Shounen, this is what makes or breaks the show. While Meliodas might be hard to like in the first season, you start to respect him more as you learn about his past in later seasons. This recipe is applied to every other character, particularly the Sins, each with their own deep and tragic backstories that are enjoyable to watch. This anime does a great job of having a diverse cast of characters and fools you into thinking that they all fit into a standard mold that is broken once you learn more and more about their past. For example, when we first meet Ban we almost expect him to have a very standard Zoro-like flair who is the equivalent of a First Mate of Captain Sir Meliodas. You soon learn however, that his motivations go far beyond simply respecting the captain and being a best friend, and I love the show for the deep interaction between characters. While I was unfortunately not a huge fan of Meliodas despite his character growth in later seasons, I loved nearly every single one of the sins, and many of the side characters as well. I give the characters an 8/10, and would gladly have gone up to a 9/10 if not for Meliodas.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
<br />
This is where things take a turn. Despite some truly wonderful world building and character development and solid entertainment, the show really falls flat in some of its animation which is inconsistent, and gets worse in later seasons It is disappointing, because we get a glimpse of how epic this anime could have been if everything was animated to its full potential. Take for example, Gilthunder&#039;s lance right off the bat. Characters were literally tossing spears at each other half way across the world and throwing them with the force of a missile, only to be caught and thrown back with flair. Then we have fights where we basically see still-frames and low-budget energy beams being shot around later on. This anime could truly have been epic if everything was given the attention it deserved. 6.5/10<br />
<br />
Pacing:<br />
<br />
The pacing was actually quite good. While there is some filler content, nearly every episode was meaningful and hit on something important. You don&#039;t have to worry about waiting 5 episodes for a character&#039;s training montage to complete - maybe just 1 or 2. 8.5/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
If you enjoy Shounen anime with a large cast of characters and DBZ style fights in general like Bleach, and you&#039;re able to stomach a little bit of poor animation and story-telling watered down for a younger audience, this is the show for you. Relish in the Shounen tropes of best friends fighting each other and love triangles in this very unique, yet still typical medieval fantasy that develops into something much more.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />

    Nanatsu no Taizai is one of those shonen type story for teens that is actually quite enjoyable to watch. I&#039;m not fond of shonen&#039;s in general, I love One Piece and some classics but my interest for the genre stops there.<br />
<br />
Story: Nothing amazing or original there.<br />
Long story short, the kingdom has been overuled by Holy Knights, the princess is looking for those called the Seven Deadly Sins to help her save her country. 5/10<br />
<br />
Art: SHOUNENNNN, I mean, the art doesn&#039;t make the anime, i thought the action scene animation was quite poor too. 6/10<br />
<br />
Sound: None of these terrible OP/ED, decent soundtrack, nothing I&#039;ll listen to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184297">
        again. 6/10<br />
<br />
Character: The MC&#039;s are cute, kinda like Luffy&#039;s crew - they are linked by a powerful bond of friendship that will save them when the big fights come - don&#039;t expect big introspection or anything fancy. They&#039;re still nice guys. 7/10 <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I&#039;m not a big fan of shonen but I think the author and the anime crew made a fine job at making Nanatsu no Taizai enjoyable. I like to watch this kind of anime &amp; layback, have a smoke, enjoy the show. This show is definitely fun to watch, it&#039;s a lot easier to get into than a lot of shonen I&#039;ve tried to watch and failed (Fairy Tail, Tokyo Ghoul etc) 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall: I think I gave it a 6 in my anime list but I&#039;m trying to convince ya shonen fans to watch it so i&#039;ll give it a 7. This is definitely a cool anime! Don&#039;t expect One Piece (best weekly shonen since Slam Dunk/HxH IMO) but you&#039;re going to have a nice time watching this, it&#039;s friendly, fun, there&#039;s action, boobs, friendship, blood, explosions, knights &amp; super powers. What&#039;s not to like? 7/10

    Nanatsu no Taizai is an epic adventure of the main character, Meliodas trying to get into a young girls pants, you could consider Meliodas a pedofile, since he is over 3000 years old, anyway the animes pretty good, its got some unqiue characters to say the least. The animation lacking to be honest, theres alot of animation derps and farts. If you are looking for a shonen anime to clench your thirst of that sweet innocent butt of action, i guess you would enjoy this animu.<br />

    In the midst of a boring ass night of scrolling through awful Netflix anime, I happened to fall upon this show. I&#039;ve heard it pop in and around of a few shounen discussions so I figured I should give it a shot since I&#039;ve been a huge fan of shounen anime since I was young. And even though I&#039;ve experienced all the shounen cliche&#039;s and linear story lines, something about Nanatsu no Taizai feels genuinely offensive to me in how it manages to surpass even the worst of shounen anime in terms of being uninspired and linear.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10 Honestly, the concept of a princess&#039;s journey

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288094">
        to find an exiled group of knights to take back her kingdom sounds like it could be really good on paper, however any and all potential is immediately squashed as most of it is used for shitty fights and nonsensical and awkward fanservice. Elizabeth and Meliodas have 0 chemistry and the only times they do are when she&#039;s just randomly okay with him molesting the shit out of her on every journey. The story hits you with cliche after cliche and none of them are done in a tasteful to get enjoyment out of. The fanservice is awful and surprisingly sexist, the characters always border on useless or way too overpowered, the plot is linear, etc. You&#039;ll get 0 surprises from this anime and if you&#039;re like me, you&#039;ll probably just get irritated from the shit this anime tries to feed you.<br />
<br />
Art: 4/10 Apart from character design, the animation is pretty decent. Nothing really to see here. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10 Definitely the worst quality of this anime. Majority of the characters and people in it are very uninteresting and horribly designed. Meliodas is overpowered, Elizabeth just cries and is there for nothing but being groped on screen. Other characters are about as one-dimensional as the protagonists, just not as annoying cause they don&#039;t get nearly as much screen time as these two morons.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10 All of the sounds from the OST to the openings are just serviceable. Nothing that really stands out and enhances the scenes but at the same time I don&#039;t really hate any of the music they have.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10 This anime is really mind-numbing. I generally have never outright hated an anime but this one really takes the cake. Everything about it feels offensive to my soul and I can barely find any good things to say about it. I feel like this anime sends out a bad message about how bare-minimum and untasteful you can make a series and still have it praised as a good shounen. Everything Nanatsu does has been done before but a thousand times better. <br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10 You&#039;re probably just better off finding another shounen series if you want something entertaining with characters duking it out. This anime is awful.

    No Spoiler.<br />
<br />
Plot( 9/10): <br />
I think that is important to look at the tags of the anime. Talking about Nanatsu, I can see this tags: Action, Adventure, Fantasy,Shounen, Supernatural.<br />
Seeing this tags, one question crossed my mind: What means a “good adventure”? <br />
The word “adventure” originates from the latim “ad venture”, which means literally “what lies ahead”. Putting this in a anime plot perspective, adventure will be the problems, conflicts, battles, etc… that the characters have to pass by to reach one determined goal.<br />
Answer my own question, what means a “good adventure” ?<br />
A “good adventure” in a plot means one multiplicity of conflicts, battles, problems. Conflicts, battles,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184117">
        problems, have to permeates all kinds of questions of a fantasy world, so talk about politics, ethics, moral, relationships (friend-friend, lovers-lovers) are things that create a good adventure (so, good things to the characters find a solution), and ,certainly, a good plot in general.<br />
PS: Some adventure can have some funny moments, and on Nanatsu all the conflicts has its pinches of comedy, if you don’t like a adventure per se, you will love the comedy immersed on this.<br />
<br />
Know that you know what “GOOD ADVENTURE” is, let&#039;s see how the plot of Nanatsu fits on this definition.<br />
Nanatsu no Taizai starts saying on what the world is. The humankind fought against dark creatures (I like to call them demons), the advantage was clear, but some specials humans learn who to use magic and gave the humankind some peace (conflict of survival is placed on the table), this humans become the Holy Knights (our army, nowadays). Here I have to say that the Holy Knights is the stronger corporation of the mankind, but they don&#039;t have the political power (this is the job for the king and the noble families). But, for some reason, Seven Holy Knights betrayed the Kingdom. They were known like Seven Deadly Sins, look that a political treason is another conflict to a good adventure. Some years after this event, the Holy Knights became a corrupt corporation, wishing more power, so they decide remove the Kings and Noble Families of the political power, again a good treason conflict.<br />
Now you know how a good anime connect the facts:<br />
One daughter (Elizabeth) of the king flees from the attack of the Holy Knights and now she is on a mission to find the Seven Deadly Sins (even after the betrayal be eradicated, some Sins still missing) and save the Kingdom (using the traitors against the traitors, just ironic). She finds the Captain of the Sins (Meliodas), the boy on the main photo of the anime and he, smiling, accept the task of saving the Kingdom.<br />
So, how i said, a good adventure plot is the one that you have problems (facts), that permeates by all the human conflicts (both in a social perspective, than in an individual perspective) and Nanatsu connect all problems with mastery, so it’s a good adventure plot.<br />
In this plot a lot of questions will grow. The Seven Deadly Sins are truly the real traitors? If not, why they are treated like traitors? What is the plan of the Holy Knights? You can create your own questions. The plot has facts that make you think, so think.<br />
<br />
Characters (9/10):<br />
I will not talk about the Princess Elizabeth, basically she is pretty girl that will do you see panties every time, and she the perfect princess for a Utopian World, just that, is a bowl of soup character, deal with it.<br />
In the beginning of the review, I said that:<br />
&quot;, adventure will be the problems, conflicts,battles, etc… that the characters have to pass by to reach one determined goal.&quot;<br />
So, don&#039;t have possibility to talk about adventure without talk about the characters immersed in the adventure. Remember that Nanatsu is a Shounen, so the characters have to pass some clichês lessons and more than that, the development of the characters will happen more in a magical battlefield than in a battle inside the head of the character . But that mental fight that Nanatsu tries to create something different (and I will explain this topic)<br />
In this point, I think that name of the anime is useful.<br />
Again, I have to put some concepts on the table. What is a Sin ? In a religious way, the sin is something that separates you from God (because, it&#039;s a break of the law of Him). For the Catholic Church the Deadly Sins are sins that guides you to the condemnation (different of the others Sins). But in Nanatsu you have to observe that &quot;Sin&quot; has one small difference in meaning.<br />
Sin on Nanatsu is the feeling that the character has to carry. One thing that they never could forgive, one feeling that gives them a strong power and, on the other hand, the feeling that prevents them to evolve. Now you understand why I talked about the concept of sin on the begin ? Because, in Nanatsu all the development of the character never will destroy the sin that they carry.<br />
<br />
So, Nanatsu tries to create a solid base for the character, based and ,I risk myself to say, delimited by the Sin. Very original.<br />
<br />
Sound(7/10): <br />
(eps 1-12)The opening and ending are very good, one thing that I didn&#039;t like is that the ending fits better to introduce the anime (for me, the ending must be the opening). (eps 1-12)<br />
(eps 13+) Now this opening is a masterpiece, the lyrics combines with the anime a lot. The ending is very good, too. Now, i can&#039;t say that the ending must be the opening. (eps 13+)<br />
But talking about the ost (&quot;musics&quot; on the anime per se) is very weak. You don&#039;t have good battle musics that put you in the fire of the battle, or a funny music that combines with the fun moment itself. And I not found one good &quot;orchestra&quot; (a good violin solo, or a good piano solo).<br />
<br />
Art (7/10):<br />
<br />
I have to say that I don&#039;t like the Art. I can summarize this feeling, saying that I felt like i was in a anime of 2002, the tracing is very thin, and I missed some brightness. The effects on battle could be much better, again the lack of brightness &quot;helps&quot; this point. With the budget that the anime have, Nanatsu could do a better work here (the same with the sound).<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10):<br />
Very good Shounen, with something more deep than swords, magic and the cliche &quot;good boys vs bad boys&quot;. You will find all this, but putting a good adventure (like I tried to explain).<br />
You will laugh a lot in this adventure. I recommend this if you want to see a shounen not so cliche and funny, and if you have some obsession with panties (prepare yourself for the &quot;fan service&quot;). Just it.

    I have never seen an anime that I liked this much, with so many plot holes. I HATE plot holes and its the only thing that always gets me with anime.  Usually if there&#039;s one plot hole, I drop it, but this one some how managed to make me want to keep watching despite the plot holes.  I don&#039;t understand.  <br />
+points for the anime:<br />
I do like the main concept and story idea. The main character is intriguing, and overall the cast was good.  And there was a descent amount of romance in the plot.  The fighting scenes were well done

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204120">
        and it gave the this bad ass feel to it with and made overpowered characters that weren&#039;t actually overpowered because all the characters were OP.  weird sort of balance.<br />
Main good point I have for this anime is that it is heavily plot driven (in a good way). despite the plot holes or simply the annoying hiccups in the plot that came out of nowhere, it hooked me and made me want to keep watching.  So if you want anime that hooks you, this is one of em.

    Garbage anime. The plot was looking good in the first few episodes but by the end of the show it turned into a parody of itself. <br />
The characters are nothing special, none of them get any development, except Ban and King, all the other characters feel bland with little to no depth to them. <br />
Meloidas, &quot;captain&quot; of the &quot;seven deadly sins&quot; is a pervert and that&#039;s pretty much all we get to know about him. The main characters are called sins, because, hey it sounds cool!<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
<br />
This is just another mediocre anime with fanservice to hide the terrible writing and &quot;cool&quot; character names to conceal the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260932">
        lack of depth. Don&#039;t waste your time with this show.

    The Seven Deadly Sins.<br />
I first saw the manga of this show and then forgot all about it.<br />
But then one of my friends gave the first five episodes to me.<br />
I am still thanking him for that.<br />
<br />
To the review,<br />
The one thing I really love about this anime are the characters. The personalities are just amazing and they make the show even better. Here you have adventure, comedy and all other shounen-like genres packaged in a single show. And packaged well.<br />
<br />
There were also some awesome battles and epic moments that make you go &quot;hohoho&quot; . The show should have been longer as they were some unanswered questions, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187765">
        hey, its still a pretty good shounen anime. <br />
<br />
Hope I did good on my first review!
