    Life is a series of choices. Even now, as you’re reading this, many choices are being made.<br />

Well, if you kept reading I’m assuming you picked number 1 and decided to read my review about Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru aka My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy aka Noucome, I’ll be referring to it as Noucome for both

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123439">
        yours and my sake. <br />
The review will be spoiler-free so some things that I point out may seem a bit oblivious but I don’t really want to spoil anything for those who’d like to watch this.<br />
<br />
This anime is about a boy named Kanade Amakusa who’s a high school student however he suffers from a curse called “Absolute Choice”. This curse does exactly what is sounds like, it forces our main character to choose from a series of options, these options will interfere with the way he and the things around him happen and interact, with many of the choices he’s faced with being completely self-degrading and humiliating. Amakusa eventually comes across a choice wether he wants his neighbor or a beautiful girl to fall from the sky. He chose the second option and that’s where he meets Chocolat, who eventually starts living with him.<br />
<br />
As you can guess, this is essentially a comedy anime with a very simple yet effective plot.<br />
<br />
The other main characters are with Kanade, the Rejected Five, it includes Yukihira Furano, a girl with a particular interesting sense of humor and who likes to abuse Kanade by calling him all sorts of things and Ouka Yuuouji, your typical happy-go-lucky and really cheerful girl.  They’re pretty much the school “weirdos” and the people with which Kanade spends the most time.<br />
<br />
All the characters have some kind of special trait that distinguishes them from the others, are carefully animated and above all really really funny. Whether it’s from an Absolute Choice, Furano’s sense of humor, Yuuouji’s lack of shame or even Chocolat’s lack of common sense you’re bound to crack a smile or, tons of laughs as the humor is really well executed and not really repetitive.<br />
<br />
You eventually discover one or two little twists about these characters and get introduced to even more characters as Kanade is forced to do missions to get rid of his curse, these missions mainly include an interaction of some sort with the cast. If Kanade fails one these missions, he’ll be stuck with the “Absolute Choice” forever, it’s also in these missions and interactions that most of the character development comes from. <br />
<br />
The art in Noucome is not extraordinary but it doesn’t put the anime behind either, it matches with the light-hearted and colorful style of the anime. I didn’t notice any kind of lazy animation or lack of detail in any scene. The background scenes also look pretty nice.<br />
<br />
The sound is appropriate but not really that amazing, the OP and ED songs are generic and the BGMs are also pretty standard, not really anything that makes me go up or down. It simply is appropriate for the kind of Romantic/Comedy anime we’re talking about.<br />
<br />
I can say that I really enjoyed Noucome, it didn’t really felt rushed and was overall a really pleasant experience that made me laugh way more than one time per episode. All the characters were unique and funny, the art was really good and the plot was the perfect setup for a Romcom like this.<br />
<br />
If you like Romcoms then I definitely recommend you to watch Noucome, I promise you won’t regret it.<br />
<br />
And now, as I bid a farewell to all of you;<br />

Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is easily the #1 anime of Fall 2013. A lot of people would love to disagree with that statement, but let me explain. You need to have refined tastes in order to fully enjoy Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru. If you&#039;re a heretic who cries at every instance possible to complain about boobies and panties, well... this anime will be making you cry. On the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124907">
        other hand, if you watch anime with a laid-back attitude and you soak in all of the nuances that it has to offer, you will definitely like Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru.<br />
<br />
The crux of Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru&#039;s plot is its comedy (well gee, it&#039;s not like the title gave it away or anything). The story revolves around Kanade Amakusa, a boy who carries a curse. His curse is that, at random moments, a God-like entity will come into his mind and force him to say embarrassing things or commit heinous acts. Thus, his &quot;mental choices completely interfere with his school romantic comedy&quot;. Not to worry though, as although Kanade acts like a nut in every other scene, the truckload of girls that surround him are just as ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Every single female character in Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is fantastic. How do you say &quot;extremely varied cast&quot; in Italian? Because that&#039;s exactly what was present in this anime. No two girls are similar, no girl is generic, and all of the girls are cute. God it just makes you want to hug them all. Chocolat, Furano, Reikadou &quot;Silicon&quot; Ayame, the Super Imouto, the Seito Kaichou... there are too many great girls to list in this anime. I tried to limit only one female character from Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru to put in my Favorite Characters list, and let me tell you; that wasn&#039;t easy. <br />
<br />
In fact, a quick interlude---let me give you a sample of what this anime&#039;s all about: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKK8fjk3tI<br />
<br />
Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is extremely ridiculous, as can be seen in that video (that video also happens to be my FAVORITE scene in the entire anime). However, that is also why it does so well. The comedy is so on point, so clever, and most important of all, so NATURAL. Never does Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru try too hard to be funny. You can tell the producers had a great time with this one (think back to the Erabe-god&#039;s laugh; god that was amazing).<br />
<br />
Technically Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru follows Kanade Amakusu&#039;s quest to get rid of his &quot;Mental Choices&quot; curse; however, let&#039;s be real. The &quot;story&quot; is a pile of crap. Instead, the producers use that as quality comedy-fodder. From his mental choices, hilarious situations ensue. Just from reading the synopsis I could already tell Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru was going to have a stupid plot. Fear not, as Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru doesn&#039;t mind that it doesn&#039;t have a plot, we as the viewers shouldn&#039;t either. Just sit back, relax, and soak in the comedy of this anime.<br />
<br />
You want to know how an anime qualifies as &quot;perfect&quot;? When it makes you laugh your ass off every episode; that&#039;s how. Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru single-handedly made my Wednesdays something to look forward to, and it was the only Fall 2013 anime to do so (I would usually put off the other simulcasts until I had more time to watch them, but not with this anime). And now, you too have a choice to make... to watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or not to watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru?<br />
<br />
p.s. If you picked the second option... well, the Erabe-god will be laughing at you too.

Imagine a life where nothing happens...<br />
Imagine unspectacular schooldays, getting up early, disputing with your little sister at the breakfast table, chatting with friends about trivial issues, learning stuff you won&#039;t need to consider ever again in the future, going shopping on the way home, and finally fall into bed utterly exhausted as if the world has changed, but in reality you just repeat the same cycle over and over...<br />
Escaping this kind of monotonous life is not as hard as you might believe,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126635">
        but one ability is indispensable in doing so: the ability to make choices. First off, everyone can swim along with the mainstream, not choosing anything on their own, and therefore repeating their everyday life. You have to realize all the possibilities to make choices which directly affect your future, most of them not even noticeable and done basically automatically. To stress the importance of choices even more, you will begin to recognize their relevance just by reading this review. Have you heard of &quot;game books&quot; before? Providing a formidable way to directly influence the course of the story, you will find this review having the same option to choose your own course.<br />
<br />
Why do I start with this explanation about choice-making, and how does it influence the actual anime we are talking about? In order to start,<br />
read on at -5-. If you aren&#039;t fond of making even the first choice here, and you also have the guts to defy this anime&#039;s god, the master of choices, proceed at -10-.<br />

Typical for newer anime, the art consists of detailed and distinguishable character parts and overall colourful backgrounds. The animation is rather ordinary, but that&#039;s fairly normal for the genre at hand, so there&#039;s no problem to get accustomed as viewer. All in all the characters keep their moe-looking appearances and please our eyes in many ways.<br />
To change into the Sound part, head for -4-, otherwise continue at -6-.<br />

As is often the case with RomComs, we have an above-average popular guy trying to keep his life in order while also having to deal with the distinctive cast of females around him. In this anime the guy&#039;s name is Kanade Amasuka; a boy who would actually possess a rather boring and average personality if it wasn&#039;t for the curse of &quot;Absolute choice&quot;: a list of possible choices appearing right in front of his inner eye at the most inconvenient times. If you are familiar with visual novels, you will recognize this idea&#039;s origin at once. And guess what, these choices practically always force Kanade to perform highly embarrassing acts in front of his classmates. So why doesn&#039;t he just ignore this choice-making? Well, there&#039;s this peculiar being called &quot;God&quot; causing him immense pain upon not deciding. The same God also provides the only way for Kanade to cure his curse, namely by completing missions. Does he choose to fulfil them all, regardless of what consequences it may have for his future social life? To stress the romance part of the anime and in order to get Kanade more sensible on this matter, these missions consist of dealing with various girls in not too normal ways. <br />
If you want to know more about the female cast, venture forward to -7-, for just a small summary go to -12-.<br />

The sound as well as the music are neither memorable nor anything special, rather simply the usual light-hearted tone suited for any school comedy. OP and ED are standard as well... but at least the handstand performance sticks out. The seiyuus are performing their assigned roles without apparent fault, and although they sometimes miss the final spark of emotion, I enjoyed listening to their diversified voices a lot.<br />
That&#039;s it for sound, so either change into the Animation part (-2-), or continue at -6-.<br />
<br />

Ah, welcome. You&#039;ve just done the first step in order to get to know this particular anime.<br />
Don&#039;t be confused by its exceedingly long name, &quot;Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru&quot; (engl. &quot;My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy&quot;), usually shortened to NouCome. Adapted from a light novel of the same name, the title is summarizing the plot quite well actually. Therefore, you can expect a solid RomCom with a main character suffering over having to deal with all kind of choices he has to make. <br />
If you aren&#039;t fond of RomComs or students doing embarrassing and crazy stuff, you can either try to sit through and change your mind about this genre, or you cut a long story short and skip right to the conclusion at -15-. Otherwise you get acquainted with the main character at -3-.<br />
<br />
<br />
-6-<br />
The enjoyment watching this anime won&#039;t reach any limit, if and only if you can cope with the general idea of visual novels, RomComs and don&#039;t mind fan service in a measurable, but not immoderate way. Coming this far through the review, you are most likely getting along with this idea and will eventually enjoy NouCome to the same great extent I did.<br />
See, to mark the occasion, god just decided to eliminate the second choice, so there&#039;s only one way to go on... that would be -15-.<br />
<br />
<br />
-7-<br />
As with every good RomCom, you need to have a multifaceted bunch of girls providing a diversified view of the romance aspect. This cast consists of three main heroines and roughly the same amount of side characters. Within Kanade&#039;s class, we have the white-haired Yukihira Furano, a shy and more silent type who doesn&#039;t miss a chance to call him by insulting names. She has a strange kind of humour, and doesn&#039;t show it nearly as openly as Ouka Yuuouji, the class&#039; cheerful airhead who is constantly participating in every joke and acting quite frankly around Kanade. &quot;There&#039;s no point in doing something boring.&quot;... a statement that would describe her life fairly well.<br />
Kanade, Yukihira and Ouka are also part of the so called &quot;Reject 5&quot;, a group of the school&#039;s oddballs due to their overly antisocial behaviour. Since Kanade is forced to be in this group by the deeds of his curse, you can assume that he wants to escape his fate and therefore has a reason to complete his missions. The curse also provides him with human help in form of a beautiful sweets-loving girl suddenly falling from the sky upon him choosing it. She names herself Chocolat and causes Kanade to change even his life at home in many ways. Since she lacks some common sense, his life doesn&#039;t get that much easier even with the help of her knowledge regarding the curse.<br />
<br />
All in all, these main characters deliver a lot of fun throughout the whole anime, and the curse provides the needed freshness to get hooked immediately. If you feel that you haven&#039;t read enough character outline yet, go on to -11-, otherwise you may also proceed with Animation (-2-) or Sound (-4-).<br />
<br />
<br />
-8-<br />
You defied god, your fate&#039;s &#039;bout to change<br />
And no one dares to enter your range<br />
There is pain up ahead<br />
And no mercy instead<br />
Your surrounding&#039;s slowly getting strange<br />
<br />
With your senses going on decline<br />
Barely managing to see a shine<br />
Of a more blurry life<br />
Nearly devoid of strife<br />
Only one way remains, go to -9-<br />
<br />
<br />
-9-<br />
Decisions can save a lot of time<br />
But only ones not including crime<br />
You have to seize the chance<br />
Which promotes the advance<br />
Like I did when deciding this rhyme<br />
 <br />
The whole world of anime just right<br />
Within your comedy-yearning sight<br />
With NouCome on top<br />
Not your average flop<br />
So now head to -14-, keep the fight<br />
<br />
<br />
-10-<br />
So, you regard yourself special enough to defy god and the world&#039;s rules? I will give you one last chance to correct the taken path by turning round, now aiming for -13-.<br />
Otherwise fasten your seat belts and continue at -8-.<br />
<br />
<br />
-11-<br />
More about the characters, eh? If you read these lines, then there&#039;s no denying you are already quite interested in this anime. A picture is worth a thousand words, and there&#039;s nothing inhibiting you to start watching it right after you finished reading this review. Female side characters include a little sister type, an abnormal teacher and the student council, and everyone gets enough time to come into their own. Experience them for yourself.<br />
Story and characters define an anime, but without the framework of Animation (-2-) and Sound (-4-) they couldn&#039;t support themselves properly. So choose...<br />
 <br />
<br />
-12-<br />
Eh... so you really thought that short summaries are sufficient enough to describe women? Don&#039;t get any false impressions of life.<br />
If you are now ready for the &quot;normal&quot; female review, turn to -7-, otherwise you may continue with Animation (-2-) or Sound (-4-).<br />
<br />
<br />
-13-<br />
There&#039;s no fault in trying to swim against the current. Sadly though, nearly every world in confined by rules, and therefore you mustn&#039;t quail if a choice doesn&#039;t bear fruit. Other choices are awaiting you in your life as well as in this review, so turn your attention to -5-.<br />
<br />
<br />
-14-<br />
But regardless, there&#039;s one thing to mention<br />
Some time ago, you turned your attention<br />
To anime and more<br />
And that&#039;s the perfect door<br />
To be able to grasp the dimension<br />
<br />
And so I hope for you to forge ahead<br />
To escape this loop, conquer your dread<br />
choose anime once more<br />
don&#039;t care about the score<br />
you&#039;ve got time, head to -9-, relieve your head<br />
<br />
(Only read the following lines if you have completely understood the poem&#039;s intention, otherwise head to -9- as described!)<br />
<br />
The first version of this review wouldn&#039;t have contained any escape routes out of this loop. But after getting the possibility to contemplate your actions, there isn&#039;t any easily understood reason for you to not deserve a new chance to use your power of choice.<br />
You may start into the actual NouCome-review now by going to -5-.<br />
<br />
<br />
-15-<br />
So, how does it feel? Ready for a romance apart from the norm concerning its premise, exhilarant characters providing nice jokes while the poor guy gets embarrassed and the constant recall about the consequences of choices? I have to admit: recently there are lots of anime about romance stories in a school environment... but the simple difference which distinguishes NouCome from the rest is the actual concept of these hilarious choices Kanade has to make, reminding ourselves of the importance always accompanying choice-making.<br />
And hey, this anime just has ten episodes! At least trying it won&#039;t cause any problems.<br />
The final choice is awaiting you, probably being the most important one in this review... read on at -16-.<br />
<br />
<br />
-16-<br />
Although you are bathing in this review&#039;s aftermath now, there&#039;s a high possibility that you will encounter at least one choice directly impacting the environment around you at least for the rest of the day. Maybe you choose to watch this very anime, &quot;Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru&quot;, and suddenly your little sister bursts into the room, discovering your secret anime crush and in the end becoming your discussion partner for the newest shows. Life is a series of choices. But one thing&#039;s for sure: you won&#039;t advance if you don&#039;t choose...<br />
<br />
So here&#039;s your final choice:<br />

    How we are able to comprehend something that is inherently dumb and insipid in shows such as these are let loose into the anime medium has always made me wonder what drives us into having such a thing as guilty pleasures. Now, when you imagine a show with those two terms in my mind, could you ever imagine a show like that trying to put in deep themes of free-will and choice into consideration? The answer to that question would be yes... and no.<br />
<br />
Yes because something like Ore no Nounai, and no I refuse to spell out the absurdly long title, could&#039;ve been thought out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124831">
        by writers just like in any kind of imaginative process of writing out ideas for shows. On the other hand, no because it would be impossible for an absurd RomCom like this to try to implement these kinds of themes perfectly, or at least it would take the skill of a talented writer to actually pull that off. Which, sadly, isn&#039;t the case for Ore no Nounai; but that&#039;s not to say it doesn&#039;t have its charming moments in some areas.<br />
<br />
The major emphasis that the show really wants to drive its plot towards is the notion of how our lives are often being created by ourselves through the choices we make in them. Since this is a RomCom, our bland perverted protagonist is confronted with many choices that threaten his social status from girls around him, hence the title. Already the logic that is thrown at us is beyond erratic and not given much thought into how the &quot;Absolute Choice&quot; works exactly. For comedy&#039;s sake, there is an unfortunate lack of wit to the humor that these choices give to the audience in the sense that: Why are there mostly only two choices? For the record, most of the choices that are shown to Kanade aren&#039;t very imaginative or creative to say the least. When you have this opportunity to think of what you want the humor to go through, you need to bring out the big guns or else it&#039;ll just become tedious after a while.<br />
<br />
Where the comedy does work is through some of the character interactions that do not involve the choice system. The chemistry between the girls and Kanade isn&#039;t the greatest because of how the girls don&#039;t leave much of an impression. There are definitely exceptions to this, them being Yukihira and Chocolat. Yukihira does come across as a vapid dandere character until she finally comes out of her shell and we get to really see what she actually is and thanks to the surprisingly well-done performance of new-comer Yui Kondou, who gives Yukihira a really funny mood swing-type of vibe to her archetype that works quite smoothly. Chocolat gives a larger-than-life personality to Ore no Nounai, despite her cliched nature when she is first introduced. While not as unique as Yukihira, her presence provides some nice needed wholehearted fun to the comedy and story.<br />
<br />
RomCom protagonists that are generally considered entertaining, or more specifically not annoying, are a rarity and Kanade is no exception to this fact. Not everything that he does or says are immediate eye-rolls, there are a few notable moments where he is quite humorous, but he eventually does go full force into bland, stereotypical protagonist territory where he acts extremely against the odds of what a normal teenager in the real world would react. This kind of thing would be done good in a comedic sense if the jokes weren&#039;t stuff that we have already seen on countless shows like Ore no Nounai and doesn&#039;t do anything with them than just copy and paste them into the narrative.<br />
<br />
Inevitably, the artwork tries its best to make the girls look the cutest and sexiest that they can be.  They definitely succeeded in this domain in giving a lot of emphasis in coloring the characters that make them very easy to identify and help us remember a particular part of their design. The amount of blushing skin was a pretty nice touch in escalating the sexual tension from looking at the girls and their cute blushing faces. The sporadic animation helps in giving the humor some great traditional face reactions that we are used to in anime. However, there were moments where CG was used in some cars in a few scenes that looked pretty dreadful but thankfully there&#039;s not much to be remembered in infamy for.<br />
<br />
The quality of the music can be construed as underwhelming in the actual show itself with your typical synthesizers, but the opening delivers a great song in showcasing the tone of the show as a whole. Even though the actual opening is quite lazy in how it was choreographed, the song at least fits well to the things going on in the opening. However, I found myself a bit perplexed in how the ending song was put into production for Ore no Nounai. It didn&#039;t fit very well to the tone in that it felt like it was more fitted into an action show than a romantic comedy.<br />
<br />
Surely, Ore no Nounai will be looked at as a strange attempt in trying to milk the high school comedy genre into grinding into slightly new territory. The result wasn&#039;t as fulfilling as the initial premise was shown before being released, but that shouldn&#039;t suggest that the show is of terrible quality. There isn&#039;t anything inherently offensive or needlessly degrading to anyone&#039;s intelligence, or at least the people who try to think too hard about it. It is convoluted as all hell in its subject matter and doesn&#039;t even bother to push it any further than what it generally tries to be another ecchi comedy. The fact that I&#039;m even talking about how we look at ecchi comedies in anime in a different spectrum is at least a hopeful note in the future.<br />
<br />
Grade: C<br />

    Have you ever wondered about how your daily life would be if your choices were to be dominated by some supreme random choice-generating entity? I haven’t thought about it all that much myself, but apparently somebody else did, and, upon obtaining enlightment, wrote a novel based this profound reflection, and thought that publishing it would be a good idea…<br />
	<br />
Kasukabe Takeru is the man, and Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (NouCome for short) is the result of his introspection.<br />
<br />
There is not much to say about the designs and animation, as they range from mediocre to subpar for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review129681">
        year 2013 and never excel compared to countless other series. There is slight censorship in the TV anime version so you might want to check out the BDs for more exposed nipples and pantsu, but the fanservice is hardly ever that explicit anyway. <br />
	<br />
Ostensively, NouCome is a comedy. As such, it presents itself by employing quirky characters, some light ecchi and build-up scenes that lead to absurd conclusions. There is a story as well: MC has to clear ridiculous “missions” so that he won’t be the target of the random choice thing again, but you will realize it is all irrelevant very early in the series anyway. There is no real beginning to the random choice thing, as neither the time and circumstances in which it started, nor are the reasons are ever explained/specified, and there is no real conclusion either, as it simply never happens, and the random choices continue after the series ends. Maybe the OVA will fix this, but I have my doubts, and it’s not like a real conclusion would bump up my opinion of the series that much, to be honest.<br />
<br />
The comedy itself is mostly a miss as well. For something with such a ridiculous premise, the jokes are pretty bland and uncreative, and get repetitive after a while. The whole series could be summarized in one sentence:<br />
<br />
“ERABE<br />
<br />
Boobs or do something dumb.” *<br />
<br />
And really, that’s all NouCome is about. The premise is just a pretext for mindless fanservice, the comedy is an excuse for either more mindless fanservice, or bad and unfunny jokes, the characters are all generic and unimportant: an excuse for even more mindless fanservice. The concept becomes a gimmick after a while since the conclusion is very predictable (afterall, you know he’s going to clear the missions without fail in the end), and for that reason the series is not able to build any tension around jokes. The build-ups are very long (usually lasting one entire episode) and very diluted with random “moe” and mindless fanservice, the jokes are really random without being weird, quirky or well thought-out and always end on the dumbest note… there is just so much that is wrong with this series that what actually HAPPENS in the series cannot be described with just a few paragraphs.<br />
<br />
As far as the characters are concerned, they all exist for comedic relief, mindless fanservice and are unimportant to the course of events. The main character doesn’t contribute to the story in any way, he is just a victim of it and, in the end, a tool with no personality existing only for self-insert. The rest of the cast is all female, and is composed of tropes that couldn’t be any more generic, bland, and poorly portrayed. Furano is the (tsundere + emotionless) /2 girl with personality disorder (not actual illness, of course, just sudden changes in personality to maximize the “moe” effect...) , Ouka is the genki childhood friend that secretly has feelings for MC, Yuragi is the loli that wants to be everyone’s imouto (yeah let’s not talk about it), Seira is the student council president, Ayame is the rich ojou-sama (am I the only one who finds her “secret” slightly disturbing, considering she’s in high school?), but the biggest offender of this sack of crap is the main girl Chocolat, which pretty much acts like a puppy animal whenever she is provided with kibble (sweets in her case). There is one episode (the 7th) in which she regains the memories of her past after hitting her head and starts acting “normally” and explaining unimportant shit to MC to help him with his problem. I guess you could call this “character development”, albeit contrived and poorly placed, if only she didn’t hit her head at the end of the episode, lose all her memories one more time, and ultimately go back to her dog-like personality. <br />
I guess that if there was one character I enjoyed, it would be Yawakaze Konagi… she’s still useless and her jokes unoriginal but at least her design is pretty cute and her moments are among the “best” in the series.<br />
<br />
NouCome is among the worst Japanimation has ever produced. There is really no content here… just ten episodes of void over average computer art 2D designs. It’s not the first time anime has produced something like this, and it’s hard to pinpoint exactly why this is more insulting, more cancerous, and more impossibly worthless than countless other series that have been made in this vein, but it is. Avoid at all costs.<br />

    &quot;Noukome is just another generic harem-comedy.&quot;<br />
<br />
...Is probably the response you would get when asking about this anime. And it holds true, as Noukome proceeds with the same method as many of its preceding anime: MM!, To-LOVE-Ru, Date a Live. Once you&#039;ve seen one, you&#039;ve seen them all. Noukome obviously has its mind set for exchanging quality plot for cute girls and second-rate entertainment. However, Noukome obviously has a directed audience to those who like watching things like this. Which is why there&#039;s no reason for anyone to completely analyze and justify an anime such as this. It isn&#039;t an anime targeted for complex thinking, mystery

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123719">
        solving or touching moments. This path of thinking has led many to automatically assume that Noukome is bad without even giving it a chance. The harem genre obviously has had this type of treatment time and time again. Why do you think there&#039;s no high rated harem? <br />
<br />
The story follows with Kanade Amakusa, who has been popular until he&#039;s recently gotten a problem with &quot;Absolute choice,&quot; where Amakusa must choose between two or more choices, usually commanding obscene actions that no one would do in public. However, if Amakusa does not choose to proceed with any of the choices, he receives pain punishment until he does so. Supposedly, this is the work of God himself (or herself, as this anime seems to play around). The concept and story of Noukome is a play on the popular visual novels seen in Japan, and Noukome attempts to make a comedy out of this, just as it is portrayed in the title.<br />
<br />
Noukome does a good job with the humor aspect -- I&#039;ve laughed so many times that I&#039;ve considered this anime a guilty pleasure. Yes, the plot has an uncountable amount of holes, and the characters are complete nuts. You would never see any of this in real life -- which is what makes it so entertaining. Do you want a story where a high school boy makes the choice whether or not to study for his History exam? Something like that wouldn&#039;t even get past the storyboard outline. And Noukome obviously has thrown away all its sense of the real world in order to make an outrageous scenario that makes us all smile at home. <br />
<br />
So why the addition of the harem?<br />
<br />
The harem definitely shifts the tide of audience more to teenage guys and men, and it makes the comedy much easier to direct to. This further reasons why second-rate plot is more common, because it develops the same amount of success with haphazard ideas. Obviously, not all are to be happy, as no anime is perfect. If a teenage guy were just to seek out outrageous entertainment, Noukome is probably a good go-to. It&#039;s funny, and fits the bill for most. Noukome does a good job on what its set out to do, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s entirely good.<br />
<br />
Although it&#039;s fine to have ridiculous characters and plot, it doesn&#039;t really sink. Noukome is good, but also very forgettable. What Noukome does could potentially be strong if everything was developed much better. With only 10 episodes, Noukome has very little time to set an impact on the viewer, and the sheer amount of characters and plot points is destined for development failure. Thus, we are left with another forgettable anime in which we may see time and time again every season. Noukome in particular has pretty good execution though. Thankfully, it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, and continues to make fun of itself the whole way through.<br />
<br />
Looking more into the overall quality, the anime&#039;s art is as cute as it gets. And for good reason, as many will find themselves indulged in jealousy of the main character. The girls being as cute as they are, are in quite a variety and with their own ridiculous personality. It&#039;s honestly hard not to like most of the girls. The music and voice acting is equally respectable, as they both fit their designated roles pretty well. They are not supreme, but are good enough to be attractive. <br />
<br />
Noukome definitely serves justice for guys who seek a comedy, but not in the way that will have him talking about it for the years to come. Noukome is more of a show we enjoy and forget about, and gives us the laugh we may be looking for.

    Ore no nounai sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or simply, Noucome.  If you were able to say that whole damn first title in one breath, congrats.  Life is a series of choices.  In it, there are good choices that lead down good paths, and bad choices which lead to not so desirable paths.  With that in mind, onto the review. <br />
<br />
 (That is, if you choose to read the rest.  That&#039;s on you.  I&#039;m just writing this for the fun of it.)<br />
<br />
Story (8/10): The anime itself is just as ridiculous as its title. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123471">
        The story follows a boy named Kanade Amakusa, who suffers from Absolute choice, meaning that his life is basically a gigantic visual novel where the choices that he makes leads him to strange and awkward routes.  Until one day, where a blond girl falls from the sky from one of his choices, leading him to begin his journey of ridiculous quests to get rid of his choice syndrome.  With all the visual novel nonsense and random girls falling from the sky, this story is really...absurd.  Seriously.  It has pretty good pacing, and is able to &quot;conduct&quot; its messed-up storyline well in terms of speed and transitions.  Speaking of its storyline, this is without a doubt very random.  Next to FLCL, it can be considered to have one of the most random storylines out there.  Oddly enough though, this anime works very well with its randomness, being able to funnel all of that into something that is in fact, a great comedy series.  Speaking of comedy, it&#039;s all random.  I&#039;m not kidding, all of the comedy is pretty much random moments that everyone enjoys.  Especially since the comedy is all pretty original.<br />
<br />
Characters (9/10): When you look at the characters, you&#039;ll see basically any anime archtype or character class you have seen in the past.  Meaning, you&#039;ll see things like the rich girl, the over-hyper one, the little sister that says (onii-chan), the glutton, all that sort of crap.  However, there is a reason why the characters are in such a high rating, and it&#039;s because of just how funny they really are.  While yes, they are all literally copies of existing character troupes, the characters take their character type, and skyrocket their potential.  Meaning, they all go overboard with their personalities.  Ex.  Little sister character wants to be EVERYONE&#039;s little sister.  It&#039;s this kind of thing that makes this anime so great.  They basically ridicule the anime troupes through their characters in a way that makes it just so frikin&#039; fantastic and hilarious to watch.  Although I&#039;m a little disappointed with the lack of main male characters aside from Kanade who is denser then a friking block of lead, it was still funny to see all of the female characters in their archtype glory. The side characters (and I mean side, not supporting.  Supporting is part of what is above.) are just completely pointless, but still funny.  They add their own stamp onto the anime, with the added conclusion of throwing them all in your face by the very end.  <br />
<br />
Art and Sound (9/10): The art in this anime was done by Studio Jack, which in turn, created a wonderfully colorful and bright look for this piece of absurdity.  The characters are all VERY detailed and very colorful.  It was to the point that they tried to showcase JUST how good the art was by doing screen scrollers of just the characters eyes to show off the detail.  The sound in this anime was just as good, in my opinion.  The OP has got to be, one of the most hyper and energetic sounding openings ever.  It&#039;s just so happy sounding and absurd, that it fits in so well with the anime!  The ED was also very good in my opinion, as it featured a hyper and energetic tune that was leaning towards the electric guitar compared to the OP leaning towards the drums, due to the crap ton of guitar riffs.  (By the way, regardless, you will hear both of these tunes one way or another.  The creators sneak them in.)  Personally, I love the soundtrack with all of its glory.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (10/10): It really shouldn&#039;t be a surprise with all the praise that I&#039;ve been giving this show, that I would give this a 10/10, and also why it&#039;s one of my favorite animes of all time.  It&#039;s just so frikin&#039; fun to watch.  Bear in mind, this isn&#039;t a masterpiece in any way, nor will it ever be, but it&#039;s just one of those series&#039; that you can just sit down and enjoy without really thinking.  (seriously, don&#039;t think when you&#039;re watching this.)  The anime is completely absurd in every sense of the word, and that&#039;s what makes it so great.  The characters are a breath of fresh air with their own twists to the story, as well as the &quot;dramatic scenes&quot; between characters that deepens the story ever so slightly.  With 2-3 potential episode names/episode, as well as little &quot;opposite choices&quot; at the end of almost every episode (I&#039;m just telling you this so you don&#039;t miss it, should you choose to watch it), the anime is nearly unpredictable and takes drastic turns at every possible moment.  With the added mechanic of absolute choice giving random and hilarious suggestions most of the time, the anime can literally turn into any situation period.  In the end, Noucome (I&#039;m not writing that long-ass title again), is a wonderfully hilarious series that can make someone forget their troubles, and is just fun to watch if your looking for mindless entertainment.  There&#039;s also fanservice btw, so be careful.  (Pg-13 rating is bullcrap for this anime.)<br />

    &quot;Life is a series of choices.&quot; Some choices are life changing and some seem to hold little to no relevancy in the grand scheme of things. NouCome is a series that&#039;s dedicated to taking the concept of choice and transforming it into a fairly successful comedy. <br />
<br />
The story of NouCome revolves around Kanade, a seemingly normal high school boy living a normal life. At least until a girl falls from the sky and he becomes afflicted with the curse of &#039;absolute choice&#039;. Essentially this means that he is given random choices (often perverse or degrading to himself) and he must pick one of the choices

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123445">
        otherwise or else he is met with a stinging pain. The story is fairly entertaining, as the audience gets to see Kanade struggle to rid himself of his new found curse through &#039;missions&#039; that involve amusing scenarios, but also lacks any substantial remembrance. I could watch an episode and easily forget what happened in it after a couple hours. <br />
<br />
The art and animation of NouCome is pretty good. If you like ogling at boobs and panty shots, you&#039;ll probably enjoy the show visually. There is a fair amount of work that is put into making things colorful and vibrant and overall the show looks pleasing. In regards to the sound criteria, NouCome is pretty average. The OP and ED were okay, but I can&#039;t think of anything that particular stood out. <br />
<br />
The characters of NouCome are a silly bunch, but at least they&#039;re fun to watch. Unfortunately the character designs are extremely bland and mostly adheres to the common girls with big, bouncy breasts cliche in the comedy, school genres of anime. The characters are all pretty dense for the most part and it&#039;s not like the series really puts out great expectations for characters to begin with. What NouCome does successfully is making awkward situations between characters, often utilizing the absolute choice for comedic effect. As a whole, the characters provide a decent cast for a series of the comedy genre and at least they&#039;re all pretty likeable. <br />
<br />
The comedy part of NouCome succeeds at providing laughs, but they are quick and don&#039;t leave a lasting impression. Most of the jokes are hit or miss like all comedy, but NouCome had more hits than misses in my opinion. The concept of fan service is no stranger to this show and it bounces (literally) in and out consistently. If you&#039;re looking for some quick comedy with constant cleavage and panty angles, NouCome delivers it. It&#039;s a bit of a shame that this show was so immensely unpopular and sold horribly in Japan because NouCome was actually a decent comedy.

    Life is full of choices. You make different choices everyday. For example, at the end of this review you will choose whether this review was helpful or not. Or you would skip that and choose whether to watch this anime or not. Similarly, Amakusa Kanade, the protagonist of Noucome, also faces choices to make everyday but the options he has to choose from are kinda twisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Mental Choices are Completely Interfering with my School Romantic Comedy&quot; (this name is pretty long so I&#039;ll refer to it by it&#039;s shorter name Noucome) is about a young second year high school student Amakusa Kannade who, despite his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125657">
        relatively good looks, is considered a weirdo in his school. The reason is the plot of this anime. Amakusa has a curse which he named &#039;Absolute Choice&#039;. Due to this curse, at any random moment a few choices will pop up in front of him. These choices are almost always ridiculous and eventually lead to situations where Amakusa makes a fool of himself. One of these choices made a blonde girl fall from the sky to help him with his curse. Around that time, he got a phone call from God (seriously, the caller id said God or Kami) who said he would help him get rid of the curse. This is where all the comedy really starts. Let me tell the plot in a different way, Noucome is the story of young high school boy&#039;s life made miserable with the interference of some Gods.<br />
<br />
Noucome is a comedy anime with a little ecchi. Although MAL does not categorize it as ecchi, it has scenes which could make it an ecchi anime. The story is well planned. It is made of random events leading to a single goal i.e Amakusa getting rid of his curse. This style is similar to that of another anime, B Gata H Kei, in which all of Yamada&#039;s actions were leading to a single goal, having sex (i&#039;m sure most ecchi watchers know of this anime). Some might think that the comedy in Noucome is stupid and senseless, but it is this large amount of comedy which makes Noucome fun to watch. Every episode is loaded with funny scenes which are sure to give you a good laugh. One thing worth mentioning here is that Noucome is your typical harem anime with a boy surrounded by girls who eventually fall in love with him. So don&#039;t expect uniqueness in terms of harem here. However, the unique storyline and loads of comedy make this anime awesome.<br />
<br />
Character building in Noucome is perfect. As the series progresses, you get to know more about the characters. Everything you need to know about the characters is told or shown so you get to know the characters much better. Every character has its own unique and funny personality. All characters, both major and minor, are there to give you a good laugh. The artwork is pretty good. The characters are well made. There&#039;s not much to talk about here as almost all animes nowadays have pretty much the same type of artwork. The voice acting is also well done the voices fit the characters perfectly. The OP and ED songs are pretty nice and fun to listen.<br />
<br />
Noucome is a great and fun anime. It&#039;s 10 episodes of pure comedy combined with a good story. Once you start watching it, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll want to complete it. It&#039;s sure to give you a good laugh.<br />
<br />
Well that&#039;s pretty much it. I know it&#039;s not perfect but it&#039;s all I could do. Let me know what you think of it and if there are any suggestions you would like to give, feel free to do so. Thank you for reading! I hope my review was helpful (^-^).

    This is my first review so I&#039;m going to do the best that I can<br />
Most of the reviews on this series seem good but I&#039;m going to give my honest opinions <br />
My review will be somewhat harsh<br />
*May contain minor spoilers*<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
The story is pretty simple A boy named Amakusa Kanade gets a curse called &quot;Absolute Choice&quot;that forces him to pick between two choices (sometimes more) and if he doesn&#039;t his head starts hurting which forces him to choose <br />
He has to manage his curse and his regular school life as part of the reject 5 <br />
Then one day a beautiful girl falls on top of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138191">
        him and starts living with him <br />
He&#039;s then forced to complete some ridiculous missions to get rid of his curse<br />
It&#039;s somewhat unique I guess<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
The first thing I think of in the art is blush everywhere <br />
The art is alright It&#039;s not so bad I can&#039;t look at it but it could be better<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
OP and Ed are alright I enjoyed listening to them<br />
<br />
Character 4/10<br />
There wasn&#039;t any characters I really liked much I will review them each one by one <br />
<br />
Amakusa Kanade-He&#039;s an average guy I don&#039;t understand why all these girls like him<br />
<br />
Chocolat-She acts kind of like an airhead and a dog I prefer her other side more<br />
<br />
Yukihira Furano-I hate how she always talks under her breath in her high voice I can understand her personality change I guess but I don&#039;t understand why she acts perverted sometimes<br />
<br />
Yuuouji Ouka-I think she acts like an airhead a lot too She&#039;s too obsessed with hiding her panties and her voice kind of annoyed me<br />
<br />
Yawakaze Konagi-Her pureness annoys me and her followers are super obnoxious<br />
It&#039;s probably supposed to be funny but it just annoyed me how they bully any guy that talks to her<br />
<br />
Hakoniwa Yuragi-Obnoxious imouto character Nothing more to say<br />
<br />
Reikadou Ayame-Typical stuck up drill haired character She&#039;s obsessed with her fake boobs and looks down on her followers It&#039;s kind of disturbing because she&#039;s in high school<br />
<br />
Seira Kokubyakuin-Mysterious student council president I wish there was more explanation on her<br />
<br />
Douraku Utage-I still don&#039;t even understand why she looks like a little kid <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4/10<br />
I gave it a chance and I don&#039;t think the series was worth it <br />
I&#039;d have to say this was one of my least favorite animes I&#039;ve seen<br />
The &quot;comedy&quot; didn&#039;t get me to laugh and there was too many ecchi scenes imo<br />
<br />
<br />
Not the best at reviewing but I hope this is somewhat decent

    Oh look, noucome... another generic harem anime... Nope, not gonna watch it... Gotta be like another date a f***ing live anyway... Idiot protagonist and brain dead heroine with the ultimate selling point was the super huge plotholes (plots and holes) and absolute cringes...<br />
<br />
I was wrong....<br />
<br />
Well, it is a pretty generic harem themed story, but the idea was not that bad, and the most important point is that this anime doesn&#039;t try to randomly combine a serious story and random jokes all together like some &quot;nowadays&quot; romance comedy. It&#039;s like... maybe, seto no hanayome? Totally random with pure comedy and cheesy romance. The show that requires

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135195">
        you shut your brain off and watch while laughing like crazy.<br />
<br />
Some other &quot;nowadays&quot; anime like date a f****ing live have done a very serious mistake trying to be serious but is actually trash. This anime don&#039;t do that. It&#039;s pure comedy, and if you try to use your brain here, you&#039;ll hate this anime. <br />
<br />
Anyway, here&#039;s the score:<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
Fair. Nah, borderline mediocre.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
No kidding. It&#039;s good. Enough said.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
MOE cultured music(?) or something like that? Usually I&#039;m not really into that kind of music, but this time, it&#039;s different. I&#039;d give 8/10 for it.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
Generic tsundere? Check. Generic dere-dere? Check. Generic (what do you call a sweet onee-chan type?) sweet type? Check. Generic imouto? Check.<br />
But why 8 points? Well, all the checked personalities are the side characters. But the main heroines are somewhat different, but you could still sense the common traits.<br />
Also the main protagonist isn&#039;t a typical helpless little brat who clings on other&#039;s help to be able to live, that&#039;s a plus for me. <br />
For character development, let&#039;s not talk about that in comedy type of anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9.5/10<br />
Perfection. Wait, no. <br />
Yes, I was laughing like crazy almost fell out of the chair, but wtf with the ending. Just the ending alone is enough to subtract a 0.5 point from the total enjoyment score. FIX THE ENDING, DAMN IT. Or make the 2nd season. pls(?)<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
By far, noucome is one of some very few &quot;nowadays&quot; comedy anime which able to satisfy my taste. It doesn&#039;t need to have a serious and mindblowing plots and storyboard. Those two aspects are hard to combined. Just a pure good comedy is enough. As long as the writing doesn&#039;t get screwed up so bad you cringe instead of laughing, then it&#039;ll be good.

Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is a comedy, school and romance anime who some might enjoy and others might not, i defintely enjoyed this anime.<br />
<br />
Story (7)<br />
<br />
The story is about a boy named Kanade Amakusa who is a high school student, at first glance he looks like a average handsome boy but he is cursed with the curse &quot;Absolute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164457">
        Choices.&quot; This curse makes him have to choose one of the choices that can appear at anytime. If he does not pick a choice he will receive a large amout of pain. Because of this curse people think he is a pervert and wierd, the curse ruined his reputation with everyone around him, but one day he gets stopped to choose one of the 2 options and a girl falls out of the sky.<br />
<br />
Art (8)<br />
<br />
The art is not the best but does not go behind other animes, the art is bright and cheerful and has that comedian feel to it. There werent any slow/bad and lazy animations. The backgrounds were detailed and didnt look any bad at all.<br />
<br />
Sound (8)<br />
<br />
I personally really love the opening, and the ending was fairly good. The handstands were really good on the openings as it showed physics and that the characters tried to balance themselves. The scenes is a bit wierd but they fit the anime. The one singing wasnt bad either. The ending wasnt bad either but i personally like the opening more.<br />
<br />
Character (9)<br />
<br />
I really love the characters as each character has a special trait or something that makes them diffrent from the other characters. The main characters are Kanade Amakusa and 3 other female characters which starts with Furano Yukihira who seems wierd and is quiet on the outside with a wierd sense of humor but on the inside she is shy and cute, there is Ouka Yuuouji who is a cheerful, energized, airhead and a happy girl however she is really pure. Then there is Chocolat who loves snacks, dinner and most food. She is really big airhead and is really useless to our main character Kanade.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10)<br />
<br />
I had a blast watching through this anime, i was suprised by how much i laughed as i dont really have a really good sense of humor. I most definetly enjoyed this anime alot. It was fun ride to watch tho i am disappointed that there were only 10 episodes, i was hoping there would be 13 episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall (8.5)<br />
<br />
I gave this a rating of (8.5) because i belive it fits the rating really good, the story was uniqe but pretty average. The art wasnt bad, the sound was really good and the characters were great. This anime shines through it comedy, but it is also a romcom so if you like these type of animes you must watch it. <br />
You will not be disappointed one bit other than the lack of episodes.<br />

    To start off, this easily became one of my favorite anime. Having watched this the first time November 2013 when it had only like 3 or 4 episodes aired, I was expecting this series to last for around 20+ episodes. However, my high hopes were crushed when I saw at the end of episode 9 that the next will be the final one.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
While many people think the series&#039; story is pointless, I personally like it and I think it is one of the strong points of this anime in which the humor and enjoyment is crafted from. Also, personally, I like anime with OP

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181214">
        being cursed and thus rendered helpless, so it could be a factor on why I gave a 9.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is good. I liked all the character designs, especially Ouka, Chocolat, and Seira. Not much to say here, though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
OP and ED is especially terrific! OP matched the series well, being bouncy and all. ED is one of my favorite songs now, but it seemed to be out of place for the anime. Still, thumbs up.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
I liked all the characters&#039; personalities, but not enough to give a 10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
All episodes never failed to make me laugh out loud in one point or another.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
-1 for incomplete material. Overall, it&#039;s a very nice anime. I really really hope for a 2nd season, but I highly doubt it with the things they are now.

    Ok, so I just finish watching this 10 episode anime, so, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait there is an absolute choice of some-kind that has roared into my room, let&#039;s see, what is it saying? What is it saying?????????<br />
<br />
Erabe:<br />
<br />
1. I am to make a long review of &quot;Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. I am to make a short review of &quot;Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru&quot; about 2 lines long.<br />
<br />
3. I&#039;m not gonna make a &quot;Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru&quot; review.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s see,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123957">
        hummmmmmmm. AH SHUT UP YOU PINCHE ABSOLUTE  CHOICE WHOEVER YOU ARE, I&#039;LL MAKE IT THE WAY I WANTED.......sorry about the troll guys.<br />
<br />
So without any further adieu:<br />
<br />
Story: Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Frankly, the story plot was, ehhhhh, just very simple and in fact it was pretty obvious that is was copied from another anime &quot;Kaminomi&quot; and they just added some twist in it. Also, the entire thing was solely focus on the poor guy&#039;s curse and the predicament he has to undergo.<br />
<br />
Art: Very Good 8.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I&#039;m guilty of the fan-service that this anime provides, even though there are some censoring in it, also I like the way Ouka, Chocolat and that big boob bimbo Reikaidou were drawn and that&#039;s about it. There is of course the swimsuit fan-service where Ouka, Chocolat and Reikaidou are the bomb.<br />
<br />
Sound: Mediocre 6.<br />
<br />
I just don&#039;t have anyway of commenting on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
At one point I do find Kanade&#039;s predicament funny, but in the last episode, I&#039;m pretty much disgusted that he didn&#039;t choose among Ouka, Furano and Chocolat and instead chooses the part where he has to stay with his curse for a little longer. As for the girls, I&#039;m a bit disgusted that studio Diomedea, has misled us audiences as to the guy&#039;s harem, though Seira, Konagi, Reikaidou and Yuragi were featured, the focus was more on Ouka, Furano and Chocolat. Chocolat, at one point where she becomes a normal, intelligent and caring girl was something that has made me like her, compared to her retard form which annoys me, Ouka on the other hand is somewhat to be should have been Kanade&#039;s love interest, Furano......I just don&#039;t like her, she maybe sweet when she is by her lonesome, but her tsundere attitude was a turn off for me. Also, this anime failed to provide any hint as to who Seira is aside from being the student council president, in fact I wondered if she is that voice that gives Kanade that absolute choice curse thing, because of these scenarios,  I just limit this anime&#039;s category to six.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Ok, I&#039;m just gonna say it this way:<br />
<br />
1. It was funny.<br />
<br />
2. I like the fanservice.<br />
<br />
3. I like the way Ouka&#039;s cutness, though Chocolat is annoying, she cute anyway and I kinda like the way she express herself to Kanade, but only if she stayed as this normal, intelligent and caring girl. Despite of Furano&#039;s tsundere attitude she is still funny enough provide the laughs.<br />
<br />
Overall: Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Tbh, though this anime is funny, there are some parts that were misleading, such as the opening theme, where we see Kanade wanting to whack Furano, but never happen, thank god, the swimsuit that were conflicting with the opening and the last 2 episodes and its lack of originality, basically it was this anime&#039;s lack of originality and it reliance on the main character getting wooped and being stupid where the reasons that I gave this anime such score.

    When you&#039;re bored and have absolutely nothing to do, this anime is definitely worth checking out. Although it&#039;s short, it delivers the same amount of pleasure as any other series.<br />
<br />
I guess you&#039;d have to have some twisted taste but it&#039;s simple yet, creative plot was entertaining to watch. I found myself laughing because of how random some scenes were. For example, in the first episode (this isn&#039;t a spoiler) the way they portray how decisions in the past have affected the modern world was so funny; no other way to word it. Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison and even Shakespeare were featured comedically. It&#039;s a refreshing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130099">
        break from the usual &quot;serious&quot; atmosphere given off of a slice of life series. <br />
<br />
Initially, this anime seems rather stupid and pointless.. and i&#039;m not denying it. It was completely ridiculous (in a good way XD) But, i couldn&#039;t help but fall in love with the characters and the art. Although they included so many different personalities, i didn&#039;t find it confusing at all. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around Amakusa Kanade, just your average student blessed with an unimaginable curse that requires him to decide between two choices on the spot otherwise suffering from severe migraines. Might i say, the choices he has to decide between on a daily basis are equally ridiculous everytime. <br />
<br />
 Despite all his efforts of leading a normal life, he is labelled as a pervert, weirdo and even &quot;imouto-fyer&quot; (lol that one made me laugh) The rest of his gang (a.k.a. The Fail Five) are composed of an overly conscious tsundere with a odd sense of humour- always coming up with the weirdest puns, a spunky and cheerful airhead, and a mysteriously glutinous girl who fell from the sky claiming to be his pet sent from heaven to help him lift his curse? <br />
<br />
What i liked:<br />
- the art was on point<br />
- the variety of characters (epecially Yukihira)

    UGH, why anime industry do you have to ruin everything semi-original lately?<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
I will start off saying points for originality, BUT massive reductions for shitting all over it. What we have is a guy who was spontaneously cursed with something called &quot;Absolute Choice&quot;. Absolute Choice erratically chooses two things that are pertaining to the situation around him most of the time. If he tries to not pick one or takes too long deciding it starts to hurt him until he chooses. This sounds great for a really original setting in a comedy. Where this fails is unsurprisingly fanservice. Nearly every single choice he has to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168403">
        make relates to him having to do something that results in fanservice to some extent. While at first this show is pretty damn funny it quickly falls off into a repetitive scenario where Absolute Choice is going to come up at the worst time and he&#039;ll have to do something most likely sexual. Throw in a generic harem cast and plots, and then you get whatever this is trying to be. This is a massive let down because reading the synopsis I was expecting something hilarious and new, but it&#039;s just another harem with a small twist. Also later in the show he randomly has three or four choices which just comes out of nowhere without any explanation.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
The animation is fine, and the characters are your usual fare. Nothing looks particularly bad, but nothing stands out. It looks clean and the characters are nice to look at. It&#039;s pretty colorful which is something I always find fun to watch. There are a few times where the designs of the art style changes and it contributes to the comedy, but again nothing that&#039;s unique among other shows in the medium. Then we got the constant fanservice shots where you see panties when you shouldn&#039;t etc. Nothing new there either. I will say that the OP is pretty interesting and if nothing else I enjoyed it for being a little weird, yet still suiting the show in it&#039;s own original way.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
<br />
The characters voices are all mediocre, I don&#039;t have any characters I can even remember the voices of outside of Yukihira because she has a few scenes where she acts differently than normal and changes her voice. The music itself is all meh. Nothing special or good enough to remember just plain anime music. Sound effects are all the usual anime ones with random noises added for comedic effect. If there&#039;s one thing you will remember after watching this is, &quot;ERABE!&quot;. Which will be said repeatedly every episode by the Absolute choice voice.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
With a plot centered around being forced to make insane decisions at random this had room to be great. It wasn&#039;t. All the characters are tropes we&#039;ve all seen in anime, and again they do nothing new with them. Being forced into these decisions could have serious mental consequences. But nothing happened with it outside of there&#039;s a way to get rid of it HURRRR; so the main character has random goals instead of trying to cope with his problem. Especially the main character just being the average comedy/harem main that doesn&#039;t do much of anything different other than make ridiculous decisions without anyone knowing why. This is comical most of the time, but all the characters are bland with minimal development leading to a show that just falls flat and gets boring and repetitive fast unless you take watching it slow which is hard to do since it&#039;s only ten episodes long.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overview: 7/6<br />
<br />
While the show wasn&#039;t what I wanted it to be it is still something original, and worth watching if you can handle the overly stupid fanservice. There are some hilarious moments, but overall it&#039;s nothing that impressive. If you want a great comedy this isn&#039;t it, there are much better options out there and don&#039;t let the synopsis full you otherwise. However if you want a funny show with a lil romance and fanservice this does it well. It&#039;s not inherently bad, it just could have been so much better and had so much wasted potential.<br />

    There are decisions in this world that people shouldn&#039;t have to make.  Some of these more unique decisions are brought to light in this unique anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
NouCome (Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru) follows Amakasu, a boy with a rather strange curse... He is forced make a random decision based off two - four choices, all of them being typically bad things.  The goal of Amakasu is to get rid of his curse, and hope to separate himself from the &quot;Failure Five&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The pacing of this anime was fast, as it felt like the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125905">
        that was suppose to take over a 2 cour was stuffed into a measly ten episodes.  Too much information was stuffed into each episode and a lot of questions unanswered.  <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The art was good, with great character designs and backgrounds looked great.  Scenery wasn&#039;t there, and animation was alright, not much to complain about since this anime is focused mainly on comedy and a comedy doesn&#039;t need the best art to get the humor through.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Taiyou to Tsuki no Cross, the OP of NouCome, is a very jumpy song that can put a smile on anybody, which is the goal of the series.  The ED, S・M・L☆, begins with a small build up and leads to a heavy guitar rift.  This ED feels out of place for this anime, but KyoAni does it all the time and I quite enjoy that studio.  <br />
<br />
Background music was fine, it is hard to mess up background music.  Carried and helped deliver the mood for the scenes.  <br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
I disliked most of the characters, the only two likeable ones were Yukihira&#039;s shy half and the lazy god.  The show started off showing multiple characters with little depth and as the show went on, I was expecting character growth as Amakusa tried getting rid of his curse.  There was no character development, they didn&#039;t even give back stories to most of these characters.  Yes in a comedy, character development isn&#039;t really needed, but the way this anime started, it seemed that there was going to be a lot of development.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
I laughed every now and then, but I found the echiness to be too distracting from the humor.  I am not a big fan of forced echi, and I wasn&#039;t really expecting almost every character to have d cups.  The fanservice is a bit much for me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
I really hope there is a second season, as I actually believe that this terrible beginning may have a shining sequel.  That or wished this was 2 cour, so they didn&#039;t have to stuff everything into ten episodes.

    Before I thought about making a review of this 10 episode anime an absolute  choice just barge into my mind and this is what is asked:<br />
<br />
ERABE:<br />
<br />
1. I&#039;ll make a review, because, you have to make a review.<br />
<br />
2. I&#039;ll make a review and I&#039;ll win the &quot;Loteria.&quot;<br />
<br />
3. I&#039;ll make a review, because my hermano is preparing my favorite Pollo Tortilla.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I&#039;m just gonna get down to business of presenting each of this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
<br />
ERABE:<br />
<br />
1. I&#039;m gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a 7, because its good despite of a corny plot.<br />
<br />
2.  I&#039;m gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123695">
        6, because it may be funny, but there are some that don&#039;t flare up.<br />
<br />
3.  I&#039;m gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a 4, as in poor, because of all the fanservice for the pierros to bark on, and beside the main character Kanade is such a moron that he should have gone with Ouka and besides I don&#039;t like Furano.<br />
<br />
Story: Ok, so for the most part seems to be a mediocre one, in fact 10 % of the plot was a bit similar to Kaminomi, here there is that harem genre where the female character&#039;s weren&#039;t butting head for the guy&#039;s affection. But, I got to hand to them since it was very funny to say the least, but I can&#039;t deny that I do have some annoyance with the role of the main character, Kanade as he was this guy who can&#039;t choose between Furano, Ouka and Chocolat, but decide to keep his stupid absolute choice curse as if he is such a sucker for it. Though, it was suppose to be a romantic comedy there isn&#039;t much romance in it as the main character was more interested in fulfilling his curse&#039;s obligation than anything else.<br />
<br />
Art: So far the art is fine, and I&#039;m not referring to the fan service that them dogs would howl for, instead, I&#039;m more on to Ouka and Chocolat&#039;s illustration where I find them cute. I&#039;m not much of a fan of Reikadou, in fact her illustration  was too mature and the same with Seira&#039;s illustration, where she looks more like a witch than a teen.<br />
<br />
Sound: I do like the ending but not much for the opening.<br />
<br />
Character: Well, I kinda Ouka&#039;s rugged sweetness, Chocolat&#039;s clumsiness and I find Furano&#039;s tsundere attitude towards Kanade funny an though Kanade&#039;s predicament was also funny, at the end of this anime&#039;s last episode my goes down hill when he doesn&#039;t go for Ouka, or let&#039;s just say didn&#039;t choose any of them so as to relieve him of his curse.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, since my absolute choice for these parts is bugging me to decide, I&#039;m gonna go for choice 2 as in the story, art, sound and character to get a Fair 6. <br />
<br />
<br />
ERABE: <br />
<br />
1. Enjoyment and Overall should get a 7.<br />
<br />

<br />
3.  Enjoyment and Overall should get a 9.<br />
<br />
4. Enjoyment and Overall should get a 10.<br />
<br />
Ok...which should I choose, hummmmmmm.<br />
<br />
I going for choice 1, as in  Enjoyment and Overall should get a good 7.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: It was good enough to be funny, but I still have to take into consideration that Kanade is annoying and there is that fanservice, but then again it was still funny and I what more can I say, it&#039;s funny, funny and funny.<br />
<br />
Overall: I guess you might say that this is one anime where studio Diomedea should have extended it to at least 12 episode, so does this anime deserve a 2nd season? That depends if studio Diomedea keeps up with this anime&#039;s good comedy genre.     <br />

    The life of young high schooler Kanade Amakusa has become a mess ever since he got cursed by a very humor-sensed god... His school reputation is a lost cause and on top of that he has to deal with a group of beatiful, highly unusual girls....can he get rid of his curse while dealing with them ?   Let&#039;s find out !<br />
<br />
<br />
Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru or Noukome for shorts is a comedy with hints of romance anime. For those more experienced in the anime world may I warn you it also has a considerable degree

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123505">
        of harem and ecchi... no nude scenes, but if you are someone that cant stand ecchi I suggest you pass on this one. For those not experienced in the anime world let me translate the last line for you, it has a lot of girls and BEWBS (yes, I am one of those guys that writes BEWBS, deal with it), again no nudity, but you will see quite a bit of jiggling, and even a occasional panties shot, also the advice stands, if you dont like BEWBS, try another anime buddy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Allright, all that being covered lets dissect this one, shall we ? <br />
Starting off with the plot, Noukome can be tricky in this point and here is why, it has a standard &quot;pre-setting&quot; but it adds a unique twist to it, which makes the plot unique enough to not be passed as just another harem school life anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
WUAAAAAT ?? what do you mean &quot;pre-setting&quot; and all that other stuff ??<br />
<br />
<br />
Calm down young padawan, I will elaborate... Here is the deal, the orginal setting is pretty standard, we have the clueless main male character, surrounded by bishoujos (Pretty girls for the non-addicted to animes) and he is leaving his terrible school life while dealing with those previously mentioned girls (HOW TERRIBLE). Standard am I right ? yeah, but luckly Noukome adds a spin to this overly done plot, and it is the Zettai choices, or absolute choices , or the awesome voice that says ERABE !<br />
This great little twist is what makes Noukome a not so standard anime, it creates a variety of unique situations, that we dont normally see in these types of animes and the effect of those scenes is almost always extremely comical.<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT WAIT ! what the heck are those choice-erabe-zettai thingly things ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahh well remembered my friend, I have to expain it to you dont I ? Very well, the absolute choices are, as the name suggests, choices that randomly appear in the head of our dear MC, if he does not choose one he gets a massive headache until a choice is made... It goes like this, lets say Kanade is going to Gamestop to buy that GTA 5 he saved money for during 2 whole months... Ahh he can already smell the blood of all those innocent civilians he will murder in the game... Anyway, once he gets there, he is about to grab the cd and BANG ! A voice in his heads ressonates sayng ERABE ! (which means choose by the way) :<br />
A-  Buy the GTA 5 and at the second you leave the store break it in half<br />
B- Spend your money in that Ben 10 game right next to the GTA<br />
And then he has to choose one, or the pain doesnt go away. Simple right ? Of course the choices are not always that bad, and sometimes they are extremely absurd, or vague... It has to be accounted though, that no matter how insane a choice is, once it is chosen it will happen no matter what.<br />
<br />
<br />
Allright, dude has to make crazy choices, got it... What about the rest ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mooooving on then, Writing and directing ! who doesnt love all this technical bullshit ? I know I do... Anyway, the writing in this is pretty solid, the plot naturally goes in the writing, and as I said before, it is a pretty good plot, the character conversations and interactions are really good as well, we got some acid comedy gold right here folks, but more on the characters later. Another great point in the writing lies in the art of making fun of himself, yeah thats right we got another of those animes right here people ! I noticed recently it has become a trend to be self-aware and make fun of your genre, and especially of genres cliches... and you know what ? I love it ! it is extremely funny for the most part, and I dont think it has been overdone YET. That covers the writing I believe, to the direction cave ! pananana ~batman theme~<br />
The direction is pretty standard, there is no crazy wild shot or anything like that, but it does a nice enough job. Thats it, not much else I can say about this one, sorry.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, technical boring shit that no one gives a damn... Done ! next please.<br />
<br />
<br />
THATS WHERE YOU WRONG BIATCH ! HA ! there is more technical boring shit ! Its art and sound time, hurray ! The art in Noukome Is really damn good, honestly its the best, in my humble opinion, in this season, I could watch this thing just for the looks and I wouldnt even feel guilty. Of course I&#039;m aware this things commonly come down to personal taste, I like colorful, pretty girls, judge me. Anyway,on the other hand the character design its not unique at all ( I Swear to god, Yukihira has the exact same character design as Koneko from DxD [but then again, I bet Koneko has the same CD as some other loli i am not familiar with]), but we cant expect much inovation on this front judging it is a harem-ecchi-school life anime. And of course the cliche designs contribute to the previously mentioned &quot;making fun of yourself&quot; jokes.<br />
The sound in this anime is just ok... I liked the OP ~Idownloadedittomyiphone5minutesafterlisteningitandIhavebeenlisteningtoitnonstopeversince~,(lets face it, we all hoped every single time we watched this, that Youuji panties would show) but the season has better OP&#039;s and I&#039;ve definetly seen better OP&#039;s in the past, but it is nonetheless a good OP, the ED was  forgetable in my opinon, I liked when it would start playing at the last scenes of a episode but I didnt fully watched it one single time after the first episode. The OST, wasnt really memorable to me either, cant think of a track that stucked in my head or anything like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Allright, now we are done with the technicall shit right ? Riiiiiiight ??<br />
<br />
<br />
NO, MWHAHAHAHA ! just kidding we are done, celebrate my friend ! But whats left then ? Characters and voice acting its whats left mate. Starting with characters, first we got Amakusa-kun, or Kanade-kun, or Amachii (my favorite), or random MC no one will remember the name in a few months... Just kidding Amachhi my man, you know I like you... Anyway, Amachii is, at first glance, a standard harem MC, but dont worry, he got some nuances to his personality, sure he is clueless, but not overly cluesses to the point it would annoy the shit out of me, like some mecha dude in this season ( YES, FUCK YOU ORIMURA ). Amakusa, not only does not annoy you much, but he can also make you like him, I shit you not, the situations this guy goes through are really tough sometimes (and funny), therefore a sentiment of empathy can be developed here (although it may quicly disapear as soon as Chocolat rubs her BEWBS against him). Speaking of devil, lets talk Chocolat, this retarded,food loving, big BEWBED, fujiyoshi ( a girl who likes when the D meets another D) who literally falls from the sky on the top of our oh-so-unlucky MC... And thats it I just completely described Chocolat, she is simple but she can win your heart, trust me, she got all that cuteness thing going on, and she can be pretty funny as well. (Also, beatiful character design, cliche but beatiful, this girl is insanely pretty).<br />
Next we got the loli (If you dont know what is a loli, just google it, I dont want to try to define it here and be hated forever in this site, it is like defining tsunderes, just dont do it) that cant be missing in any any decent harem, yes we are talking about Furano Yukihira ! This girl was probably my biggest surprise in the show, as soon as I saw her in the OP I thought &quot;hey, another kuudere (again google it) loli, good to see you Koneko-chan&quot;, but I&#039;m glad to say, Yukihira surprised me, she is with no doubt the funniest character in the show, her acid ironic personality is something I rarely see in animes, specially in her type of character, and her humour was simply delightfull... she even got some twists to her character that I did not saw coming, not gonna spoil it, but it was really unexpected.<br />
And finally closing our main cast, we have my personal favorite in the harem, Ouka Yuuouji, now this girl is just amazing, at first glance she is just a mildly retarded, careless, funny girl, and that alone would already made me like her, but she is DEEP man ! and not in a perverterd way allright ? wipe that little smile of your face you perv... Anyway, what I mean is she has a lot of layers to her personalty, I dont want to spoil it, but I will just say dont think your first impressions of her are her full personality... also may I add, she can be EXTREMELY cute... really I wasnt expecting som much cuteness from this girl, but hey I&#039;m glad I got it (again, another cliche design, but really pretty, I could stare at Ouka all day and not be tired of it).<br />
That finnaly concludes the main cast ! yaaaay ! Allright real quick mentions to some supporting cast characters : the sensei, i like her, she can be funny, the imouto girl... dafuq was that (still good though), and finally the moe (google it) girl... Just want to mention her because of her followers, that one recurring joke with one of the followers : HILARIOUS... clap clap clap, very well done.<br />
<br />
<br />
THAT WAS SOME HUGE ASS TEXT MAN ! are we over now ??<br />
<br />
Nope not yet, but I promise it wont take much longer ok ? Now the voice acting, the noble work of our dear Seyuus. For me this one of the most important aspects of any animes, it is as important as any conventional acting in any conventional movie, if I may say so. And Noukome is really outstanding here, all the main cast, and I repeat, ALL THE MAIN CAST has a terrific voice acting, thats not something I would say for most animes, now dont get me wrong, I am not saying most animes have bad voice acting, they do not, all I am saying is they usually have standarly good voice acting, with normally 1 or 2 seyuus that detach from the rest of the crew and really do a remarkable job. With Noukome however all 4 main characters, plus the Erabe voice guy do a amazing job. Ouka and Chocolat are dubbed respectvelly by Ayumi Tsuji and Kaori Sadohara, these girls did a amazing job proviiding all the cuteness their characters demanded, especially miss Kaori, Chocolat voice was incredible and since she doesnt have many animes on her curriculum I hope she starts to get more roles after this. Amakusa and the Erabe guy are dubbed by Toshiyuki Toyonaga and Jouji Nakata, respectvely again. This time the outstanding part comes in the comic situations, the smooth alteration of voice tone is done exceptionally well, if you did not notice really try and pay attention, it makes a world of difference. Finnaly the Yukihira seyuu, miss Yui Kondo... just another ridiculously good job, how easy she can alterate her voice tone is incredible, and I could pratically feel with my hands the irony in Yukihira voice sometimes... really well done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh man you went all serious and shit over there didnt you ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I take my dubbing seriously... But enough of that lets be silly again BEWBS !! Allright sorry for that, lets end this awfully long review ok ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Final thoughts, Noukome was a pleasant surprise this season, it has enough charm and comedy to hold you trough its only 10 episodes... probably. If you listened to my warning in the beginning of this review, you know that if you dont like Ecchi you should skip on this one, it is good but I wouldnt say it is good enough to make me tell you &#039;hey endure trough all those BEWBS, it will be worth it&quot;<br />
If you do like it, or dont mind it, I say give it a shot, it is funny, a joyride and so short that even if you dont like it at the end you wont waste much time of your life.<br />
<br />

    Some may point out the complete lack of anything that could pass as a &quot;plot&quot; in this anime. Others could criticize the cliched character types and lack of any development whatsoever. It&#039;d be a fools errand to try to argue with either of these points.<br />
<br />
But sometimes I don&#039;t need those things! If I wanted to find storytelling and literary merit in absurd places, I would have become an English major. Sometimes a troll-tastic anime full of puns, slapstick and yes, fan service, is in order. This anime is lighthearted and absolutely hilarious, and never failed to put a smile on my face OR any of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180271">
        the shameless friends I watched it with. <br />
<br />
Your enjoyment may also scale with your level of Otaku-ness. References to other anime, or even producers, are strewn throughout the show (bonus points for the Fate/Stay night reference). Even if these don&#039;t make sense to you, however, you&#039;ll still enjoy yourself. It&#039;s not Noucome makes sense the rest of the time anyways.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: This anime is approximately 10x funnier if you are watching the FFFANSUB sub of the anime, compared to the other subs out there. The other subs do a more literal and.. correct... translation, but the effort FFFANSUB put into making both the puns translate well (a Herculean task) and some other ridiculous translation choices make it truly a different anime experience. <br />
