    Before I begin my review, I believe there is a thing or two about Bishounen Tanteidan that needs to be cleared up before actual scoring the show on its own merits, as it feels other reviews seem to miss these aspects.<br />
<br />
Bishounen Tanteidan is inherently, unrealistic. The middle schoolers act like 20s bohemian adults. They go toe to toe with kidnappers, a possibly supernatural murderer, an esoteric artistic weirdo, a first grader who acts like an adult princess trying to save her dynasty through marriage, and somehow, a middle school casino racket done for very....dangerous purposes and reasons. Realism is completely lacking in this show.<br />
<br />
And thats

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404758">
        what it is supposed to be. The middle school setting of the story, is a way for nisioisin to focus on topics relating to growth and childhood, and using extreme situations to examine them. To put it simply, its intentionally ridiculous, but to the normal point of requiring suspension of disbelief. The middle school setting and age of the characters, is an aesthetic allowing Nisioisin to explore and admittedly have fun with situations of growing up, such as discarding your dream, your change in personal philosophy, and your habits. Basically, if you can suspend your disbelief for something like fantasy or science fiction, you should suspend disbelief here because this is similarly an aesthetic, just not one we are really used to, and if ever seen, usually done unintentionally(like western YA novels having kids talk like 30 year olds...is mostly unintentional bad writing. Nisio&#039;s trying for that here though).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Saying all that, the first arc is stupid. Too unrealistic even for suspension of disbelief. Almost dropped the show because of it. Thankfully, I didnt. Although Im not saying this show is a masterpiece or even great, its just a fairly enjoyable and fun show. Witty dialogues, charming philosophical conversations, great visuals. The pretty boys are all one note for the most part, with Mayumi being the only one with real complexity. Most of the time, or pretty much all the time, the mysteries are kind of no big deal, and you are left wondering as to why they are thinking so much about this(im talking about the esoteric artist weirdo arc). But it is through these frivolous adventures, that the show is trying to show us something important. Child&#039;s play and wonder. Even in small, even ridiculous things, there can be a sense of excitement, mystery and wonder. Sometimes its not even about solving the mystery, but just making something beautiful and having fun in the process.<br />
<br />
Its not a classic show. I doubt this is one of Nisio&#039;s stronger works either(Ive only seen Monogatari and Katanagatari at the time of this review). But its a fairly fun seasonal show, and if you like shaft or nisio, you should watch it. Also, while I do give it an 8, if MAL allowed for .5 ratings, Id give it a 7.5. Definition of good and fun, but nothing too special.

    “Because this is… child’s play, after all.”<br />
<br />
Bishounen Tanteidan is an anime adapted from a mystery novel series by Nisio Isin, directed by Akiyuki Shinbou and animated by Studio Shaft. It’s literally Bakemonogatari. The end. Thank you for reading my Bishounen Tanteidan review.<br />
<br />
That’s everything that I’d need to say if we were living in an ideal world. We’re not living in an ideal world. We’re living in a world full of liars. In this particular case, full of liars that lie about liking something that they can&#039;t even begin to understand.<br />
Here’s a completely hypothetical example: if a person that doesn’t know how to read says that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404863">
        they like a certain book - that isn’t necessarily a lie. After all, the book might have some beautifully drawn illustrations of sexy girls, and “the pictures make my pp hard so I like it” is reasoning as rational as any. If the same illiterate person says that they dislike a different edition of the same book featuring beautifully drawn illustrations of sexy boys instead - that also isn’t a lie. “The pictures make my pp confused so I dislike it” is also reasoning as rational as any. But if that illiterate person then says that they are a big fan of the author who wrote those books, and they think that Book A has good writing, but a completely different Book A has bad writing - they’re a lying hypocrite. They can’t be a fan of a writer, being illiterate and all. Don’t listen to their lies.<br />
Now, leaving the world of hypotheticals: Bishounen Tanteidan is objectively the same exact show as Bakemonogatari when it comes to things such as character writing, dialogue writing, psychological themes, comedy, artwork, animation quality, visual direction, and sound direction. Their differences are entirely superficial - one features a cast of pretty anime girls in high school, other features a cast of pretty anime boys in middle school. To a fan of Nisio Isin, Akiyuki Shinbou, and Studio Shaft such as myself that liked Bakemonogatari for all the things above - these differences might as well be different hair colors. To a fan of Watanabe Akio (Bakemonogatari’s character designer responsible for that show’s extremely fappable anime waifus, as well as for 99% of its commercial success), these differences are a deal-breaker. Not a problem, if only some Watanabe Akio fans weren’t lying hypocrites that pretend to be NisiOisiN/Shaft’s fans. Don’t listen to their lies.<br />
<br />
Now, here’s why I can’t recommend Bishounen Tanteidan anime to anyone who isn’t a Shaft/NisiOisiN fan. <br />
The Monogatari Series is a novel series that is completely unadaptable. That’s what Nisio Isin himself thought - and he was right. Even though Shaft’s adaptation both has a ton of artistic merit and is commercially successful (thanks, Watanabe Akio), it fails as an adaptation of the actual novels.<br />
What makes the novels unadaptable is:<br />
1) A metric ton of comedic banter that seemingly doesn’t advance the plot, but is irreplaceable as a tool for developing characters and establishing their relationship dynamics - the anime had to omit most of that due to the runtime limitations.<br />
2) A metric ton of internal monologues that would amount to a guy staring at a wall and talking to himself in a visual medium - the anime team had to jump through hoops to make those moments look visually interesting, and they did a commendable job - but they also had to omit most of those due to the runtime limitations.<br />
3) The novel series is incredibly long, with 28 volumes as of now, and it has an incredibly drawn-out myth arc (a myth arc is like a story arc, but for the entire series). Many fans of Monogatari will say that their favorite installment in the entire franchise is the so-called Second Season - and for a very good reason. The Second Season is the point where you can finally begin to make sense of what the entire story is really about when viewed as a single cohesive work of fiction, not just a collection of loosely connected individual arcs. The first episode of the Second Season is the 31st episode of the entire franchise - that’s an entire 2-cour anime + 4 OVAs you have to watch before you can even begin to understand what are you watching. And there is a reason why “it gets good after XX episodes” is a meme - because it never gets good. That’s just not how anime works. The fact those first 30 episodes are popular at all is an anomaly and has nothing to do with their artistic merits (thanks, Watanabe Akio). <br />
By the way, this drawn-out style is not a fluke, that’s how Nisio Isin writes all of his series. E.g. Medaka Box is a 200-chapter-long manga that only starts making sense around Chapter 50, and is effectively a single “novel” that can’t be adequately judged on a per-chapter or per-story-arc basis.<br />
<br />
What I’m getting at, the Bishounen Tanteidan novel series is unadaptable for all the exact same reasons. In many aspects, its anime has it even worse than Monogatari’s one. The Monogatari TV anime adapts its first five volumes (Kizu aside) in 30 episodes, Bishounen Tanteidan adapts its first five volumes in only 12. Based on one volume I’ve read (adapted as the first three episodes), Shaft had to cut virtually ALL the scenes that do not directly advance the plot. For example, they omitted the running gag of Mayumi repeatedly spitting out Bossman’s food because of how unbearably tasty it is - and him going through the five stages of grief in reaction. They’ve omitted another running gag of Bare Legs-kun trying to constantly peek under Mayumi’s skirt - and her doing her best reenactment of the “it’s like she was looking at walking garbage” meme in reaction. These character interactions are supposed to keep the audience entertained until the real meat of the story kicks in, and they’re supposed to make the audience empathize with the cast. But since the anime was forced to omit those in favor of telling its salad dressings of detective mysteries, for the first 9 episodes it appears to be a show about nothing. And the mysteries feel as if they have no stakes to them because there can be no stakes if the audience was not given enough reasons to care about what happens to the characters.<br />
For a [real] Shaft fan the show still works as an art project - its opening dance animation is the best sakuga produced by the industry since Violet Evergarden, every keyframe belongs on an art gallery wall, and Sakamoto Maya’s (Mayumi/Shinobu’s VA) performance is as stellar as ever. For a [real] Nisio Isin fan the show still works as a source of more of his prose, plus they come equipped with the knowledge that stuff will happen eventually. But it doesn’t work as a novel adaptation and it doesn’t work as a stand-alone anime for a hypothetical viewer that doesn’t know who all these people are. This adaptation simply can&#039;t stand on its own legs without being supported by the reputation of its makers.<br />
You do finally start to get glimpses of this series’ myth arc in the last 3 episodes, that is, the adaptation of the fifth volume. Turns out, Bishounen Tanteidan is a story about childhood, or rather, about growing up and dealing with that exact moment in one’s life where a child becomes a young adult, which in Japanese consciousness is conveniently marked by the transition from either elementary school to middle school or from middle school to high school. For the first 9 episodes, the cast of larger-than-life hyperbolic children engages in what, as the line used for the epigraph points out, is really nothing more than child&#039;s play. And then the games end, and they have to face reality - the reality of the adult world. I’m looking forward to more novels getting translated so that I can actually experience this story.<br />
<br />
In summary, if you want to see a title that deals with the themes of a child becoming an adult that works in the anime medium, watch FLCL. If you are new to Shinbou’s aesthetics and Nisio Isin’s prose - I suggest you put this one aside, watch/read 20-30 works made by those creators, and return to the Bishounen Tanteidan anime afterward. Otherwise,<br />
<br />
10/10 for “Bakemonogatari [with less fap material].”<br />

    First anime I watch of this writer. The art style, animation and everything else is amazing. The character designs are creative and attractive. I found the story to be really terrible though. It was really long winded and boring at times. Things that could be told in a more clear way were explained in really weird and complex ways for no reason. It is obvious that is how this writer likes to narrate their stories. The story also doesn&#039;t seem to have any plot. It&#039;s literally episodic, in each episode they deal with something for no apparent reason, nor final objective. The story ends with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404735">
        nothing but some kind of weird bonds between the characters. As if nothing happened, there was nothing this story wanted to tell, nothing that it wanted me to feel.<br />
<br />
I find that the characters are quite peculiar. I came to appreciate them at the end, but I also find that most of the guys (except Manabu Sotoin and Hyouta) and the protagonist, Mayumi, do not reflect their ages at all. I know age means nothing in anime, but here it was clear and appalling as Manabu was the only one that actually sometimes showed childlike behaviour. The other all acted as if they were highschoolers, while they only are in middle school. Manabu still being in elementary/primary school. I kind of appreciated the more mature ways of some of the characters, but it was also weird as they were still children, but thinking like adults.

    First review time. You&#039;re probably not watching because of all the boys. What a mistake that is.<br />
<br />
Now this is such an enjoyable anime. Every shot dumpsters every other anime currently airing - and I say that as an avid 86 fanboy. It really isn&#039;t even close. However, it&#039;s not like the show is only pretty visuals. The story is engaging. It is typical Nisioisin, where it&#039;s hard to understand and outright impossible if you&#039;re not paying close attention to what&#039;s going on. People that watch casually while scrolling through their phone or talking with friends are destined to hate this show, and the onus is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397192">
        on them. Not because the show is bad or that it has too many boys.<br />
<br />
It frustrates me how seemingly no one is watching this, and are praising Higehiro, for reasons unknown. (Fanservice and sexualizing a teenager will do that, I guess.) This show is so much more than that. While I complained that Higehiro is a shallow, uninspired show, PBDC is the polar opposite; which is ironic because you could argue that the character&#039;s outlook of beauty borderlines on extreme shallowness... but when you look beyond the surface (or past the first couple episodes) it&#039;s so much more than that. I&#039;m actually kind of blown away that Nisioisin branched off and something like this. It shows that the man is an unrivaled genius, and coupled with Shinbou, are a dynamic tandem and among my favourite in anime, period.<br />
<br />
If I had to rate the show right now, both due to my own personal enjoyment of the show, as well as the laughably low score that is currently on display (7.19 as of the writing of this review), I would have to give it a 10. I won&#039;t score it yet since I tend to prefer to wait for shows to reach their climax before judging them fully. It&#039;s so completely different from Monogatari, but the writing style still gives me fond memories. It really gives me The Hardy Boys vibes. There is no other anime like this. PBDC is something I didn&#039;t know I needed, but it excels at making you love the characters and interested in what sort of mystery they will get themselves in next. Its splendor is only highlighted when you compare it to the cesspool of unoriginal, mediocre harem shows that get attention only because of the good looking half naked girls.<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t wait to pick up the books. I will finish up the season first though. As usual, Shaft doesn&#039;t disappoint. PBDC is up there with 86, Vivy and To Your Eternity for anime of the season in my book.

    Here it is, the most underrated anime of the season with one bang of OP.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but I think It&#039;s almost a moral choice to leave a review of such misunderstood gem of the season.<br />
<br />
First of all, the anime is clearly SHAFT from start to finish, precisely the monogatari&#039;s SHAFT, so if you&#039;re familiar and/or enjoy those kind of direction cuts and style I think you will find this to be your cup of tea as well. The animations are always spot on and flawless 10/10.<br />
<br />
Story wise I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll do any spoiler by saying that it&#039;s structured in story arcs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400015">
        of 2-3 episodes. We follow the members of the Pretty boy detective club in their investigations with an eye to the beauty and style and overall &quot;prettyness&quot; of the problem solving process and the characters. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re familiar with another SHAFT work such as Kubikiri cycle there are similarities in the themes and solving puzzles thing but, for it&#039;s multi arcs structure the way they unveil the mistery is way faster and simpler. Nonetheless It&#039;s still fun to watch how things will come out.<br />
<br />
In the end. I will not recommend you to watch this show if it&#039;s your first Nisio Isin show or if you&#039;re looking for a challenging/complex detective story. But if you want something eye catching, a true gem that shines bright for style and beauty, and relax in the meantime, well, you can sit and click play.

    Shinbou and bakemonogatari writer = this series<br />
<br />
recommend by just watch 2 episode and you can drop it. Story have cited reasons, but only beauty so it looks stupid but beautifully stupid because some of dialogue is interesting.<br />
<br />
I admire the characters who are handsome and cool, similar to the art of this story, that they do look like they are special unlike any other story. All in all, look deep for me now. Even though I still compain story that kind of confuse and hard to have fun. OP make me dance a little<br />
<br />
overall I feel this series is mediocre but I believe the end of

    To be part of the exclusive Pretty Boy Detective Club, follow these 3 rules: Be pretty; Be a boy; and most importantly, Be a detective.<br />
<br />
The famed Monogatari novelist NisiOisin is back, as is studio Shaft together with chief director Akiyuki Shinbo, ready to tackle another series that the legendary novelist has concocted, namely the Bishounen series. Originally, this Bishounen Tanteidan (or the Pretty Boy Detective Club) group was supposed to appear in one of NisiOisin&#039;s earlier series that is aptly named the Boukyaku Tantei (or The Forgetful Detective) series, but during its story development, he decided that it could be made as an independent title

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404699">
        separately. And yes, you could definitely see why that stems from the off-beat logics that NisiOisin is known for, mainly subverting his audience like an open book, keep things the same status quo, right until the end when it hits in the most ridiculously subliminal messages that at the end of the day, still makes total sense. And that&#039;s to top up with all the idiosyncrasies of its underlying thematics, that if you have watched Monogatari before, it makes complete sense and links up with the unorthodox and impeccable writing of NisiOisin, while keeping things constant, consistent and fresh with book novel-like cases spanning 2 to 3 episodes each.<br />
<br />
Enough talking, let me showcase to you what the Pretty Boy Detective Club in Yubiwa Academy is made out of, in their glorious Bishounen gleaming beauty of light:<br />
- The turquiose-haired 5th grader elementary schooler: Manabu &quot;the Aesthete&quot; Sotoin, leader of the club. Don&#039;t try to belittle this young leader, he exudes beauty through and through with his arrogant cheerfulness, and will not do anything that goes against aesthetics. Often recognised as &quot;the Leader&quot; of the club, he dishes out orders to the rest of the group in the most kid-like Bishounen style.<br />
- The snow-white-haired 3rd year middle schooler: Nagahiro &quot;the Orator&quot; Sakiguchi, vice-leader of the club. He holds another position in the school as the Student Council president, mostly thanks to his beautiful voice and having marvellous imitations of vocal cords, while being soft-spoken with honor. Word goes around that he has a fiancé, but it&#039;s the stereotypical setting of his family being rich people, and cherry-picked for the best...with a  6-year-old 1st grader elementary schooler, and as such, is labelled as a lolicon for all the wrong reasons.<br />
- The orange-red-haired 2nd year middle schooler: Michiru &quot;the Epicure&quot; Fukuroi, delinquent of the club. From his external appearance, Michiru stands out due to his easily aggravated behaviour, and is widely known as a gangster, both in and out of school with his fearsome nature. Deep down, he is anything but that, he is also a good cook and has a family-oriented side to him. And get this, his habit of satirical metaphors is what gives him an edge to stand out from the club in various ways<br />
- The yellow-haired 1st year middle schooler: Hyota &quot;the Adonis&quot; Ashikaga, the angel and speed demon of the club. Being an ace of the track and field team, Hyota is largely noticeable for his long, bare, pure legs, that stems from the fact that he modified his uniform to make it look like he&#039;s wearing shorts. The beauty which comes from his well-developed face, as is looking the part like an archangel, this bare legs-exposing boy poses strength and speed when the situation calls for action.<br />
- The black-haired 1st year middle schooler: Sosaku &quot;the Artiste&quot; Yubiwa, the expressionless artist of the club. He is a child prodigy with both financial and artistic talents, though expressionless and of few words, and that  Manabu can only read his thoughts and interpret that to the T.<br />
- Last but not least, the newest member of the club: Mayumi &quot;the Seer&quot; Dojima, the star-studded girl of interest. I hear you say: &quot;Wait, isn&#039;t one of the rules of the club mention that to &quot;be a boy&quot;?&quot; Yep, she was once part of the club&#039;s very first case of NisiOisin&#039;s introductory book in the series, titled &quot;The Dark Star that Shines for You Alone&quot;, of finding a star that she has been searching for 10 years since young, of a dream that she wished she&#039;d become, but to no effect. Following the resolution of the case, she often cross-dresses as a boy (though the other Bishounens know her true nature) to visit the club, and as the series progresses, be accepted as part of the elusive beautiful &quot;Shine like a diamond&quot; club. Her eyes are what captured the attention of the Bishounens, and with excessively-good eyesight, she usually wears glasses to suppress her &quot;powers&quot;. She gives names to the Bishounens for easy memory: Mr. Leader for Manabu, Mr. Senpai for Nagahiro (after Michiru noticed that Mayumi is always calling him Sakiguchi-senpai, which is a mouthful), Mr. Delinquent for Michiru, Mr. Bare-Legs for Hyota, and Mr. Child Genius for Sosaku. There, this is as pretty as a picture as you can get.<br />
<br />
This is an excessively beautiful team of boys, but without a specialized production team, how does one take this beauty to showcase it further? And that&#039;s where Shaft comes in with the help of in-house legendary director Akiyuki Shinbo, the chief director of the Monogatari shows from the last decade. Having an in-depth knowledge of how NisiOisin likes to rehearse and rephrase (or say, take a gander of) his works, Akiyuki Shinbo does the insanity of a engrossing and psychedelic work with his production team that rehashes all the intricacies of how a modern-day Monogatari adaptation would possibly look like, while keeping true to the testament of the now decades-old experience that he is known for. And it certainly looks great no doubt, I had the nostalgia of watching the many Monogatari adaptations before, and this show&#039;s niche themes just urge me for more of that coming-of-age, mystery theses of decorative compositions and motifs.<br />
<br />
That prepossessing action alo trickles down to the OST, and the boy band sumika has done it once again to present a rock-solid OP that reminds me a lot of WotaKoi&#039;s iconic and highly memorable OP, one that&#039;s easily another magnificent and catchy song, no doubt. The Beautiful Bishounens come back to deliver 2 EDs, the former for being every ongoing case and the latter for the ending of each case. Personally, I prefer the latter as the most attractive of the 2, but still, both are lovely charming songs. Simply...delightful.<br />
<br />
Bishounen Tanteidan a.k.a the Pretty Boy Detective Club is a very niche show, that&#039;s the obvious part. It&#039;s when the irresistible feel of watching those drop-dead gorgeous young boys do their action that it arrests you with its bonny aesthetics and fancible Shaft visuals to become one heavenly bewitching experience just to see more Bishounens mark with stylistic valour and grace.<br />
<br />
Dang, I could call this show being the opposite of the overly common CGDCT formula, dubbed CBDCT: Cutesy (and Handsome) Boys Doing (en)Chanting (and Engaging) Things. A buffet treat for the ladies (and few men).

    Pretty Boy Detective Club: the most frustrating anime I have ever watched. This is the epitome of a show that had such potential, only to slowly yet surely drain away. I began loving it and if it could have been executed better, the score would have been MUCH higher- a brilliant voice acting cast and an interesting premise, misused...<br />
<br />
Story- 2/10. From the first episode, I never could have thought this rating would be this low. A girl who seeks a hidden star, mixed in with almost sci-fi elements is an intriguing concept. At least, if it actually had an impact on the plot. After the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404791">
        first great arc, the story began to disconnect and future arcs had little effect on each other. While each was a fun mystery, some &#039;answers&#039; made no sense, even for anime. Plus, I cannot get behind the whole &quot;be pretty, be a boy and be a detective&quot; motto; this is overly simplistic and for the entire anime to be based around it? Poor quality.<br />
<br />
Art- 10/10. This is exceptional. The animation is some of the most beautiful my eyes have ever laid upon; in fact, there was an overall aestheticism that should not go unappreciated. It was beautiful- there is no two ways about it. I also thought the illustrations in the OP/EDs were lovely; major props to Shaft Company for their BRILLIANT work.<br />
<br />
Sound- 6/10. As previously mentioned, my adoration of the OP/EDs is vast. I listen and dance to them a lot. Sumika (the band who made Shake &amp; Shake) did a superb job and the cast singing the EDs was a lot of fun. That being said, the OST for the rest of PBDC was &#039;pretty&#039; mediocre, though I did like the classical aspects. The major gripe I have is that in the pilot, an actor&#039;s voice cuts out and in the finale, the ED stops midway. This felt cheap. There were not many moments for the voice actors to shine either (apart from the amazing EDs).<br />
<br />
Character- 5/10. Now, this is the score that pains me. These are sweet characters with nice attributes; I especially like Hyouta Ashikaga, who I thought was very unique. Then again, they were all &#039;face-value&#039; characters. We know next to nothing about them and they had little to no development, which is VERY upsetting for me. I am extremely sorry about this rating.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 3/10. I loved seeing the characters on screen and definitely vibed with the OP/EDs, but the story dramatically brings this down. Each episode had a very similar and honestly boring structure; talking, and more talking, and even more talking, which is fine if the dialogue is interesting. Unfortunately, it is not. I will not deny that the first arc was highly enjoyable and some future ones had their moments, but my love for this anime did gradually and sadly lessen.<br />
<br />
Overall- 5/10. Yet again, I shall reiterate that this is the most frustrating anime I have ever watched. I desperately want to love it, to have more action and fun. As a result of the the execution, this is impossible. However, let me give HUGE respect where it is due for the magnificent animation and &#039;nice&#039; detective characters. Despite its faults, I thank PBDC for the aesthetic journey.

    Ah, Bishonen Tanteidan, such a dissapointement...<br />
<br />
Story 3/10:<br />
It&#039;s all over the place. The only remotly good arc that I can remember is the first arc that introduced us to the characters and gave us a nice, interesting mystery. Everything after that was just straight up boring or overcomplex for no reason.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10:<br />
I must say, the strongest aspect of Bishounen Tanteidan is its graphics. SHAFT plays around with different styles and types of animation, which was surprisingly beautiful to see. Although one of the problems of this show is that because of the artstyle, every character doesn&#039;t seem like a middle schooler [Except for Manabu since he&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404826">
        in 5th grade and we can see that]. The animation was okay.<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10:<br />
The sound was just okay. It wasn&#039;t something special. The OSTS were there, the voice actors did their jobs correctly. However, the opening was really good.<br />
<br />
Character 1/10:<br />
Now this is the part that was the most dissapointing. After the first arc, the protagonist Mayumi Dojima loses all her spark and character. She quickly beocmes a character that you could summarise in few words such as &#039;&#039;scum&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;cross-dressing&#039;&#039;. She doesn&#039;t have a dream anymore, all she does is hang out with the club members, resolving some weird mysteries.<br />
The other characters completly don&#039;t feel like middle-schoolers at all. Would you honestly believe me Michiru a&#039;ka Mr.Delinquent is 13? I don&#039;t think so. They all act like they&#039;re highschoolers, which in fact - they&#039;re not. They&#039;re kids. <br />
As I said before, as Mayumi can be summarised in few words, every other character also can. Suspecting Lolicon and soft-spoken? That&#039;s Nagahiro. Quiet and involved into art? That&#039;s Sousaku. Oversexualised and kidnapped a few times? That&#039;s Hyota. It was honestly really annoying to see characters descent like that. Now, every line Hyota makes involves him talking about kidnappings, because he was kidnapped few times. Give it a rest, buddy. We all know.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 2/10:<br />
As the first episodes were enjoyable, the others were definitly not. The characters that are minors had really inapproporiate shots, were sexualised a lot and as the story progressed the mysteries were becoming more and more complex. You may think it&#039;s a good thing but in this case it was horrible. All of the parts are episodic and each one of them contain such useless details and unnecessary dialogue that it is driving me insane. It&#039;s simply not enjoyable anymore and you just wait for the episode to end.<br />
<br />
Overall 3/10:<br />
Would I compare it to Ouran Highschool Host Club? Definitly not, it would be a shame to compare this anime to OHSHC. Would i reccomend it? Definitly not. It&#039;s not worth your time.<br />

    &quot;In a speech, what matters is who speaks, not what is said.&quot; - Unknown author. (i think that&#039;s how it goes)<br />
<br />
After about 2 worrying years for Shaft they are back again with a new piece by Nisio Isin and Shinbou, this is basically what you need to know about the anime, if you are going to watch this because of the &quot;Mystery, School&quot; genres you&#039;ll probably get disappointed, and if you are expecting something big, stop. <br />
<br />
Nisio Isin has a very interesting style and maybe &quot;weird&quot; for the standart you see in adaptations. In Bishounen Tanteidan the mystery and detective parts are not actually supposed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404794">
        to be considered the main points, they are not even real detectives, do you really want actual deep investigations from a school club called &quot;Pretty boy&#039;s detective club&quot;? The club and the investigations are just base elements for the interaction between the characters with a strong focus on dialogues. The real mystery here is why this anime has the &#039;mystery&#039; genre and not the &#039;slice of life&#039; one, there is no real history it is like a roleplay in a detective club.<br />
<br />
With only that being said the anime doesn&#039;t really look interesting but here is where the author and the studio shine. I already said that Nisio Isin has a very interesting style, his works are known for being dialogue heavy and still really enterteining mostly because of the usually excentric characters and the use of the other elements to support them, for example in his work &quot;Katanagatari&quot; that obviously seems about swords, most of the screen time does not have any action or fights, so even though Bishounen Tanteidan is simple this style is well applied and carries the anime. Now the best part is how Studio Shaft is able to complement Nisio&#039;s style, they usually do an amazing art job, specially the ambients that are elegant and sometimes surreal, always complementing the characters, the director does an amazing job transmitting the character&#039;s feelings with artistic shots or playing with the art style, i will say that the first few episodes didn&#039;t felt that good but later it got so much better, the last episode is an amazing production.<br />
<br />
So, Bishounen Tanteidan is a simple but with personality, pleasent, beautiful, slow-paced anime. (7.5/10)

    Story is kinda boring. I get that other people might find it interesting it&#039;s just not for me. I usually like the odd mystery solving stories, but the mysteries presented in this anime I just don&#039;t care for to stick around for them to solve. The way they solve them isn&#039;t interesting either. <br />
<br />
The art I can appreciate, it&#039;s just not really for me again. The way they focus on the legs sometimes is kinda uncomfortable. Like they all kids.. The backgrounds look beautiful and the character design is very unique. Definitely recommend if you like aesthetic anime. <br />
<br />
I really like the opening song. It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400168">
        very fun, the whole opening is very cute. Pretty much all music is pretty nice. <br />
<br />
The characters, again they just don&#039;t interest me. They are presented as this unique odd bunch with special abilities and all different from each other, which is just not enough for me to care for them. They don&#039;t have much dept imo and any character development or attempt at showing dept feels artificial. The story and it&#039;s characters just don&#039;t flow naturally. I guess they have charisma so I understand why people still like them. I just don&#039;t feel anything for them. <br />
<br />
For entertainment value, honestly I couldn&#039;t finish it. I tried. Even at 2x speed it became too boring to me for all the reasons mentioned above. I do still recommend you to give it a watch for a few episodes before deciding for yourself. I still think many people could like this.

  I’m not even gonna make a opening let’s just start <br />
<br />
Story.<br />
<br />
The story fit episode by episode unless it’s a part 1 if so a new arc is starting. Every new arc seems to take place at a different time but that doesn’t really matter. The first episode works for the first episode and the story remembers where it went last so it doesn’t matter that the arcs take place at different times it’s more of a couple day thing. I think that it’s set up works for the type of story it is and can’t be done any better.<br />
<br />
 The story was a bit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402115">
        complex but I was able to understand it. It worked for me but on episode 9 I didn’t really understand it (I’m deducting one point for that.) <br />
<br />
The story was unique and I loved it. In a first look seems like a reverse harem but Mayumi Doujima (the girl) hates all the boys. The pacing was good. There were no filler episodes just arc 1 arc 2 arc 3 etc. with nothing in between. Nothing felt rushed to me. <br />
<br />
There wasn’t a lot of comedy but when there was I laughed. The mystery always is very interesting. I’m not good at noticing these things but I didn’t see any ecchi or fan service which makes me happy because i don’t like that stuff I only notice that kinda stuff when it’s very obvious though.every individual element was great.<br />
<br />
The ending of each arc (but episode 9) makes sense. In the end of every episode they sold and explain the mystery. I couldn’t find any plot holes or things being forced.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I love this series art <br />
<br />
The art style is beautiful and very artistic. From the starry eyes and the well shaded hair to the shading and the way they draw the shoes. It’s unique and memorable I haven’t watched anything with the same art style. <br />
<br />
It appears  they were going for a dreamy art style. If so they did a great job achieving  it. I think the part that makes it look the most dreamy is the realistic fabric and the anime look combined and the starry eyes. The dreamy look fits the story perfectly especially in the first three episodes because they are looking for a star and the main character dreams of becoming a astronaut. [thats not a spoiler don’t worry.]<br />
<br />
They sometimes changed to a chibi style for a couple minutes but it blended in well. Although there’s only one season when it dissent change to look like that the style stays perfect.<br />
<br />
The backgrounds are good. The details are beautiful they all perfectly work. There are tiny details and big details. The shading is great and so are the tony details. I love the anime itself but the background might add to it in a way.<br />
<br />
The character designs are great. I see the character personality’s by just the designs but they aren’t completely personality based. All of the characters look unique. <br />
<br />
Definitely 10/10 <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Note I watch the sub so if the dub is bad I’m talking sub<br />
<br />
The characters voices where great for there personalities. I can’t really say much about the voice acting I don’t know much about the voice actors but when I could say one thing I did.<br />
<br />
You don’t really notice the background music if your me but when you did it fits. The music you notice really enhances the scenes. I don’t see myself listening the music in the background for no reason because it doesn’t have lyrics but I still like it.<br />
<br />
I didn’t really like the opening (it isn’t in episode 1) but I see other people liking it so I won’t take away a point. I love the first outro. It made its way into my playlist. I also like the other ending that ending plays when they solve a case.<br />
<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
I’ll ask myself this like I’m interviewing myself because I’m having trouble writing this section.<br />
<br />
Did the characters have flaws and strengths?<br />
<br />
I would like to notice Yubiwa Sousaku for this question he’s A genius child. He is the successor to the Yubiwa Foundation, which is the management body of the Yubiwa Academy but he’s very quiet and people are surprised when he says something loudly and clearly and when he does things he gets overly absorbed in them causing Mayumi to interpret him negatively at first.<br />
<br />
Did the characters react to situations realistically?<br />
<br />
Most of the time everything they did felt pretty realistic. One thing that felt unrealistic was a middle schooler giving out homework to his club. If it was ever unrealistic it just kinda slipped past my brain.<br />
<br />
We’re you able to relate to any characters?<br />
<br />
Not fully but in a way. When I didn’t relate to them I still enjoyed it.  <br />
<br />
I got a big crush on a lot of the characters. I liked all of the characters a lot. The one I talk<br />
about when I talk about me simping is  Hyouta Ashikaga because he’s really cute but in relatability it’s a different case.<br />
<br />
I will probably remember these characters forever 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
I loved this series. others would probably enjoy it to it it was popular. I asked my non anime friend if she liked this while we watched it together and she said yeah. I will probably rewatch the whole thing a 100 times because it’s so good. I don’t notice things well so rewatching this would help me notice all the tiny details. I honestly don’t think it would change at all even though I know the answers about what happened. This is a series I will definitely remember. It unique it’s enjoyable it’s perfect. <br />
10/10<br />

    Bishounen Tanteidan is a show that isn&#039;t as popular as I thought it would be. And I can somewhat see why that is so.<br />
<br />
Story - 7<br />
I have a thing for detective stories. I like the way they show the tricks on how things are done as well as the actual mystery-solving itself. While this has a hint of that, the story is surprisingly lacking. <br />
The first three episodes center around a single arc, which makes me somewhat worried for the pacing of the show and each episode, but I&#039;ve heard that the source novels aren&#039;t really long so there&#039;s that.<br />
That being said, dedicating a single

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395580">
        arc to the first three episodes is definitely a risky move, and I can see why some people got turned off by that fact alone. I certainly hope it gets better throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Art - 10<br />
It&#039;s beautiful. The sky, the scenery, the character designs, it&#039;s very beautiful. <br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
The OP is done by sumika, which is a strange choice, but eitherway it is an absolute banger.<br />
<br />
Character - 7<br />
I feel like the character is somewhat weak so far. All the boys are really just a single talent in a body so far, and though they are still entertaining, I hope to see them improve on this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7<br />
I enjoyed it when I first watched it, but looking back I begin to see more and more of its flaws.<br />
<br />
Overall - 8<br />
Its pretty nice, but is somewhat of a hit or miss.<br />

    I would never even have considered watching this show if not for the fact that Shaft was producing this. A reverse-harem show with episodic mysteries featuring pretty boys doing whatever silly antics that the author decides to do, with a female protagonist that dresses up as a bishounen. Reminds me of Ouran High School in terms of premise, but undoubtedly a lot different in execution.<br />
Nisio Issin...do I even like this author&#039;s work? Meh. Monogatari series was only salvageable because Shaft took creative liberties with it, but the source material...less than ideal. Zaregoto series is actually alright, but later volumes are pretty mediocre. I just figured

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410864">
        this out now, but Medaka box, a series I actually do like quite a bit was written by Nisio Issin.<br />
I have come to realize that Nisio Issin likes ridiculous, mysterious, and bizarre characters that talk about empty philosophy and take equally as inconsistent actions. There is not much trying to decipher any of the characters because their personality is transient like that of the clouds in the sky. They come into contact with the protagonist, and end up influencing both the protagonist and the plot in a significant way. His writing style is definitely unique and eccentric.<br />
Much like the characters in Nisio Issin&#039;s works, his quality is also inconsistent. it&#039;s quite clear that he doesn&#039;t always put out home runs, and this is indicative of that. I usually find the characters in his works to be charming, one way or the other due to their unique natures, whether it be someone like Oshino in Monogatari, I in Zaregoto, or Medaka in Medaka box. Bishounen Tanteidan&#039;s characters are quite tame, and they actually have little to no interesting dialogue that does not circle around their archetypal personality traits. Soutouin states that his club members not only needs outer appearances to be pretty, but also the inside to be pretty and beautiful. If only that were true. Each character is defined by a set of personality traits revealed to you early on, and it never really expands beyond that due to the episodic nature and lack of character development. Not to mention that I dislike reverse harems or harems to begin with, and you can see why I never would have picked this up if not for Shaft.<br />
Sure, animation, editing, and production value is great. It&#039;s a lot better than Zaregoto in terms of fitting the source material. And yet, I say: it sucks.<br />

    Oh boy, my first Nison-in review. This outta be…difficult.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Pretty Boy Detective Club rules: 1) Be beautiful. 2) Be a boy. 3) Be a detective. On the eve of Mayumi Dojima’s 14th birthday, the girl looks up at the sky searching for a star that she had witnessed 10 years ago but has struggled to find since. On the same night, a haughty young boy in a detective’s outfit comes up to her and offers his aid to find the star that she’s been so dedicated to find. This boy’s name is Soutouin Manabu, the president of the ‘Pretty Boy Detective Club’ where in their school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404789">
        of Yubiwa academy, is a club comprised of multiple ‘pretty boys’ who solve mysteries beautifully.<br />
<br />
Up until now, I haven’t really talked about any Nison-in works because a) they’re seeped in a lot of double meaning phrases that are quite difficult if you don’t know Japanese, and b) because his narratives are very…peculiar in both their presentation and execution. In terms of what Bishounen Tanteidan brings to the table, what we end up getting is a set of episodes that’re divided into four or so arcs, each focusing on a different mystery that seems both extraordinary and very out there in terms of the scale or topic that’s being talked about at the time. And these ain’t some small case mysteries either. No, this show includes stuff like assassins, government projects, and kidnapping the entire school body. Definitely not topics or plotlines you would expect from a show about a school detective show. Which I think lends to part of the problem of why the show ends up faltering on its storytelling.<br />
<br />
From a thematic perspective, the show is about the carefree time in childhood where imagination runs wild and the world is often more fantastical than it really is. As a result, the tone of Bishounen Tanteidan is exceedingly whimsical with a lot of pompous flair given the outlandish nature of a lot of the stories that the show ends up giving us. However, presentation can only get you so far. Because it’s Nison-in’s writing style, most of what ends up happening in the show is told, not shown. And in a detective show where the supposed crimes happen off-screen, the result ends up being a lot of suspension of disbelief needed in order to follow along the plotline in any reasonable manner. The end product of this creates a show that feels more like a series of rabbits being pulled out of a hat as many, many key plot points or mystery solving elements get brought out of essentially thin air and personally brought me out of the experience because half of the stuff the show brings up sometimes makes absolutely no sense, but it goes along with it anyway cause that’s the thread we’re gonna be following now I guess.<br />
<br />
Another detriment to this style also comes at the cost of the show not being very cohesive as turning away for a brief second can easily lose one’s place in the show because the narrative is so seeped in dialogue and monologues that missing even a bit of it could make audiences miss some crucial information; I know it did for me. That and both the scene and topic changes that happen in the show are often times so drastic that it feels like whiplash when the first part of the mystery falls onto part two.<br />
<br />
All of this comes to a head when the mysteries all just sort of…end. Story conclusions I feel isn’t one of Nison-in’s strong points, and it really shows here where sometimes it doesn’t feel like anything really happened from the start of the arc to the end. There really isn’t anything tangible that seems to have been solved at the end of these arcs, with very few if any lasting effects on the characters as a result of the actions that they took prior to the arc’s ending. The show ends up feeling unsatisfactory to watch as a result, which I think sums up Bishounen Tanteidan very well: unsatisfactory. For all of the flair and pompousness the show flaunts, nothing really sticks from this narrative as everything resets back to square one at the end of the arc. The show ending pretty unceremoniously too doesn’t really help its case either as it just further proves some previous points on top of making it seem like nothing really matters. No narrative weight means nothing really ends up mattering, and for all of the charisma that this show tries to exude, it’s disappointing that it ended up this way.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Aside from her special eyes, Mayumi Dojima is honestly not that remarkable of a character. True, her character arc is centered around becoming a member of the Bishounen Tanteidan, but then there’re these other, later traits that we’re told about that really don’t make much sense in the end. Quite frankly her only notable character trait is her relationship with the other members of the club, and she kind of becomes less interesting as a result because there’s not that much to her.<br />
<br />
And then we have…the rest of the club. True, I could separate Manabu from the others, but at the end of the day, the club itself feels like an entity with 5 different flavors of eye candy. True, they all have surface level traits like the bad boy, the school president, the track star, and the artist, but there really isn’t much else too them because none of the interactions they have mean very much at the end of the day. They definitely fulfill their own niches, especially with how each of them is sort of featured in one or more of the arcs, but at the end of the day, they’re not really that much more than the whole that they end up creating.<br />
<br />
As a final note, the side characters in this show are way more interesting than they really should be. In true Nison-in fashion, entire background and settings are completely barren of even mob characters, making the show look significantly more empty than it really should be. But in place of that, the show hones onto a small handful of side characters that they feature since each arc has like one or two new characters that have some form of importance to the story at the time. Personally I find these side members to be way more interesting than the main cast, but true to the story, they all feel eccentric but rather empty since they all only have like one important scene in an entire arc and because everything is told, not shown, the whole scheme falls apart because we haven’t really seen anyone do anything up until that point. And sometimes it feels like the show just writes in some random motivation even though we’ve never seen anything to indicate what they’re talking about.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
Well, thanks Shaft for bringing out the big guns again. Given the fact that Shaft and Nison-in now have basically a married couple relationship, the kind of quality that Bishounen Tanteidon got on both an art and animation perspective is both amazing and not surprising in the slightest. While there aren’t that many headtilts, the rest of Shaft’s flair from the poses to the extravagantly detailed backgrounds are top notch and add more to the lavish aesthetics that the show tries to flaunt. On the topic of character designs, the ones for the side characters are really nice and I lament not being able to see them more often because they stand out a lot especially in respect to the main cast who all practically wear the same thing.<br />
<br />
A fun thing I did enjoy as well from an aesthetics perspective is the numerous other artstyles that the show utilized. I feel like the showrunners did this kind of stuff ‘just because’, which if that is the reason, I respect that. Definitely shows off the kind of budget this show had, but is definitely one of those creative liberties I like being used to its full potential.<br />
<br />
Sumiya’s “Shake and Shake” is exactly the kind of song that I expected from a show like this, and I really could not be happier with the song choice. Bombastic, cheerful, and energetic, the song encapsulates the kind of flair and flaunting the show tries to show off, doing it all to a really nicely animated opening sequence that again shows the kind of budget that this show had. Personally I find this to be a really memorable song that screams the Bishounen Tanteidan. The EDs are both less memorable by comparison, which is kind of unfortunate because there’re two of them, but neither are as well produced as the opening. As a side note, the ost for this series is really dramatic. Which again, really helps sells the overdramatic flair that the show is really going for.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Given the married nature of what Shaft and Nison-in can do when combined, especially when Akiyuki Shinbou is added to the mix, I expected this show to blow me out of the water and be a small bite of quality to its goliath brother, the Monogatari series. I was very wrong. And I feel sad that I was wrong on this one.<br />
<br />
Because so much of the story is told through events that happen off-screen, nothing tangible actually happens when our main band of characters learns of the event, and at the end of the arc, nothing comes of it as a result. The show being all style no substance ends up creating something that feels wholly unsatisfying and hollow to watch, and it’s unfortunate that the ‘tell don’t show’ style of writing that Nison-in relies on created such a dud. True, the childhood freedom that the show uses as its thematic is present throughout the show (if you look hard enough), but because that stuff is so hard to find, what I ended up focusing on more was the outlandish plots of assassins, gambling, and secret government projects, which aren’t necessarily things that I thought I would be a feature in this show about middle school detectives.<br />
<br />
And it’s because of that that I feel like this show misses the mark and ends up creating wild plots as a way to capture the audience. What’s being shown and what’s being said feel like completely different stories, and nothing that’s being presented makes much sense. My guess is that this show requires multiple watches in order to make sense, and even then, the small semblances of additional understanding that can come from watching the show multiple times I don’t think justify the narrative being as janky as it is. So while the show does have a lot of extraordinary charisma associated with the three rules that the Bishounen Tanteidan abides by, there’s not a lot else to this show, and as such, I wouldn’t really recommend this show for a watch. Indeed the aesthetics make the show look very pretty, but it’s all pretty meaningless if there’s nothing interesting to go along with the nice visuals.

    Before I begin rambling, I&#039;d like to specify that I haven&#039;t watched the last episode yet (it&#039;s still not out), and that I also watched this anime in 2x speed, so some things might have flown over my head. Also, this is my first review. Pretty exciting!<br />
<br />
Story-wise, I&#039;d say it was overall decent, albeit a little disappointing. The narrative did a good job setting up every mystery and artfully presenting it to the audience, and the process of uncovering these mysteries was fine -- a little innovative. However, the conclusions often fell flat and failed to live up to my expectations. Lots of events seemed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403881">
        to come out of nowhere. They barely made any sense, and seemed randomly inserted into the story to conveniently wrap up certain plot points. The conclusions were often rushed, lazy and predictable. They paled in comparison to the beginning of each mystery, which left me feeling generally disappointed at the end of every arc. Book? Mystery? I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re called. You get what I&#039;m referring to.<br />
<br />
Now onto the characters. This was a pretty big disappointment for me. Save for the heroine, the cast felt flat and one dimensional. They didn&#039;t have any depth or development throughout the anime, and they were generally only characterized by a single trait. They felt more like archetypes, really. I was expecting the narrative to delve deeper into every boy&#039;s character, their motives for joining the pretty boy detective club, their personalities, their hardships, their daily lives. Instead, we ended up knowing virtually nothing about the cast. Which was strange, because they were a very promising group of characters. I mean, a delinquent with a secret affinity for cooking, a silent child prodigy who happen to be the heir to a multi-millionaire company, a 5th grader who leads an eccentric detective club comprised almost entirely of middle schoolers? They missed so many opportunities to explore these characters and flesh them out.<br />
<br />
The only character who felt complete was Mayumi. She was properly fleshed out, had a clear personality, and was overall very likable. She also had a lot of development throughout the anime, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I really liked her inner monologue, it was very fun and refreshing. Loved her &lt;3<br />
<br />
The art was absolutely outstanding, though. I&#039;ve really got no complaints. It was insane. Not only was the animation smooth and fluid, but the character designs were very lively and distinctive, the colors were refreshing, and the composition of every frame was exceptional. Try randomly pausing this anime, and you&#039;ll notice the frame you&#039;ll land on will most likely end up looking wallpaper-worthy, regardless of the timestamp. And, wow, the character designs. I don&#039;t even have the words for them. Absolutely insane. The boys indeed were pretty.<br />
The art overall felt like fruit loops -- I don&#039;t know how to explain it. It just felt like fruit loops. Colorful and lively and sweet.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime was very promising. My expectations were high, however, it failed to meet most of them. It was still a pleasant watch, though. Not to mention the art drove me positively insane! But all in all, it was pretty forgettable. A solid 5/10 in my book. Maybe a 6/10, depending on how the last episode goes.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!

    This is just fine, nothing much to say. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m crazy or something but it gives me some monogatari vibes, it&#039;s kinda particular. One of the little things I have to say is that the art is so much good, it&#039;s really well made. The sound aspect is kinda good, nothing particular but it&#039;s good.The characters are pretty good, they&#039;re all eccentric and kinda weird and it&#039;s kinda cool. Overall it&#039;s kinda enjoyable, not the best you could watch but it&#039;s fine. Am I the only one who finds it weird that the fujoshi still haven&#039;t arrived to ruin this show? Idk

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398736">
        it kinda feels like it&#039;s the kind of show that they would love.

    I&#039;ve seen fans of this show say they hate when people compare it to Ouran High School Host Club, and I completely understand why. Aside from a crossdressing female protagonist and a club of pretty boys, there really aren&#039;t many similarities. They&#039;re very different shows, and if you like one of them there&#039;s no guarantee you&#039;ll like the other. I won&#039;t lie, I&#039;m a huge Ouran fan and that premise is exactly why I took interest in this show in the first place, but I won&#039;t hold it up against Ouran as a judgement of its quality. <br />
<br />
Pretty Boy Detective Club&#039;s fatal flaw is that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416750">
        it takes itself too seriously. When the twist of the first arc was revealed in the second episode, I had to pause multiple times because I was laughing so hard. And that&#039;s not a bad thing! It was so stupid and over the top that I thought it HAD to be self aware. The show HAD to know that this was a terrible twist, that it was completely nonsensical and no one could ever take it seriously. I was so entertained by it that I was telling people about it for days, and I couldn&#039;t wait for the next episode to come out. <br />
<br />
Sadly, I was mistaken. The show has absolutely no self awareness. The cast of characters navigates their way through nonsensical mysteries, arriving at batshit insane conclusions with no reasoning behind them, with essentially no plot connecting each arc. They hint at something more going on behind the scenes, with a secret society and a rival student body president from another middle school, but these plot threads never go anywhere. I was really disappointed as the show went on, and worse, bored. The mysteries were stupid enough that they didn&#039;t make sense, but weren&#039;t so over the top dumb that they looped back around to so-bad-it&#039;s-good territory. It felt like the show still wanted to be taken seriously, like it was unwilling to just be a silly, low stakes series of mysteries. <br />
<br />
I might as well mention the cast here. Not a single character has any sort of arc or purpose for existing. They are all given a single personality trait, a name, and a quirk, and then spend the rest of the show doing nothing. When I watched the first episode, I was excited to see what role each of the characters would play in the story. They all seemed to have a decent starting point for some fun character interactions, but they never moved past those starting points. In the last arc, the protagonist and the red hair boy had a couple scenes together where they demonstrated pretty good chemistry. Would&#039;ve been interesting to explore, in, say, a twelve episode TV anime series. <br />
<br />
Some of the characters are better than others. The red hair boy I mentioned before comes pretty close to having a personality. The main detective boy, the one with the blue hair, is honestly so grating that I was tempted to skip forward a few times so I wouldn&#039;t have to listen to him speak any longer. The only character who has any sort of development (and I use that term very generously) is the student council president, the one with silver hair. His development happens through a different character who exists for one arc, long enough to make us suffer through another nonsensical mystery, and then never comes back. Any development that he went through is instantly scrapped in the next arc and is never brought up again. <br />
<br />
This show&#039;s one saving grace is its visuals. At a certain point, I was only watching for the backgrounds and barely reading the subtitles. The art in this show is absolutely gorgeous, it&#039;s honestly worth watching the first couple episodes just to drool over the visuals. I bumped up my overall rating by a full point just because of this. <br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m really disappointed by this show. It&#039;s confusing at best and boring at worst, and there is absolutely no depth to the characters. You&#039;re better off saving your time and watching something better.

    pretty boys detective club, a show that was one step away from greatness.<br />
<br />
this show was a perfect example of why 1 weak point can ruin an entire story, depending on what it is, and in what story it is being weak in. <br />
now let me start with the positives and then get slowly to that single negative that ruins the show:<br />
<br />
art, direction and animation:  9<br />
<br />
 its more than good enough for this kind of show. I mean if this was a battle shounen, 9 would be extremely high for this animation and art. but if I&#039;m being honest, I don&#039;t think making the animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411966">
        better than this is going to change much. so this is was without a doubt, perfect and the best part of the show. and its a studio shaft work, which have yet to see a badly directed anime from. so needless to say, the direction was just as good as the art and animation.<br />
<br />
sound, voice acting and music: 7.5<br />
<br />
the music was always well placed and it sounded great. <br />
the voice acting both in sub and dub were fitting and energetic.<br />
 the sound design was ok, but nothing special. none of these blew me away, but they were always good.<br />
<br />
characters and dialogue: 5.5<br />
<br />
while the dialogue was amazing and even some what poetic, i sadly can not give much credit to the all 1 dimensional cast of characters. the best one of them was by far the mc but even she wasn&#039;t out of this world. the main thing that makes them weak is something completely different though, which I will talk about in the next part.<br />
<br />
story and the writing: 4<br />
<br />
let me be the first one to say it, the writing is really good. do you remember what I said about one thing ruining the series. this is it:<br />
<br />
pretty boys detective club, is a masterfully written kids book, aimed at the wrong audience. but it could have easily been for everyone. let me explain:<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I need to say why this is not aimed at age 8-13 which I think it should have been aimed at if they didn&#039;t want to change the story. with its slight fanservice, and sometimes adult humor, this show is at least trying to be enjoyable to teens and adults also if not only. even if it is aimed at both, it still means its a missing the mark for most people watching it. now you may ask, why does it only work for younger people? <br />
<br />
and that is because of the mystery. when you make a mystery show, you are making something that makes you want to know the answer. that&#039;s the hook of a mystery, wanting and guessing for the answer, and then getting a good one. pretty boys detective club is missing that hook. there is no story, in this show, the focus is on the mystery, but the mystery is not a hook. because it doesn&#039;t make sense.<br />
<br />
while you might say its only meant to be fun, that still does not excuse not making sense. a story can be over the top, and stupid sounding , but still come from a place of it own logic. <br />
<br />
you can indeed make a mystery with a stupid answer work, but if that answer comes from guessing and good luck, then its not a creative choice, it&#039;s a problem. haruhi is a great example of a show that sounds stupid, a lot of times is stupid, but it still makes perfect sense with context included.<br />
<br />
now the thing about the characters. they are also a problem. they don&#039;t act like children or adults. the act like adults acting like children. meaning they alien both audiences while also making the message of the show less connected to the story .the point of the story is ruined by them not being completely like kids.<br />
<br />
 this might have worked if the theories were a little less stupid, but they aren&#039;t. the result is a bunch of adult like children that are meant to be smart but only come off as lucky. its like the author is revolving the story around them to make them look cooler than they actually are. which works for kids, but if they are the only ones that matter, what&#039;s the point of  those teen/adult elements? hence the audience problem. if this was aimed at kids, then the characters and many more points don&#039;t make sense , if it was aimed at adults or/and teens, the mystery makes this show just bad.<br />
<br />
a mystery with no reason may work for children, since they don&#039;t care much about the plot, but that&#039;s the only audience this show can give satisfaction to. and even for them some stuff are out of place if not straight up bad!<br />
<br />
it was possible to make the story work and still make it make sense. if it wasn&#039;t, i wouldn&#039;t make it my job to point it out. but this is a fixable problem that results in 0 side effects if its fixed.<br />
<br />
 would it have been harder for the writer to do that and also keep the charm of the show? well yes.<br />
<br />
would it being the case have any negatives, along side the huge positives that it has? no, it would be a straight up upgrade that makes the experience better for everyone watching it. and for the few that doesn&#039;t, it still wouldn&#039;t make them like the show any less.<br />
<br />
it would have been a huge + and nothing else.<br />
<br />
most people care about the story. yes for the small percentage that don&#039;t, this is an almost perfect show, but most people do. this show&#039;s hook was the mystery, meaning the mystery is the most important part of the show. so when that is bad, it takes away from the show, more than anything else could have.<br />
<br />
 and makes a show that could have been easily rated above 8, a low 7 on mal, and a high five for me.<br />
<br />
my final score is:<br />
<br />
5.75/10<br />

    The level of production that went into the art for this series is amazing.  I feel bad for the artists. <br />
Visually spectacular, but devoid of any other substance.  It&#039;s trying really hard to be Ouran.  Injecting quotes by famous philosophers between meaningless drivel does not make a compelling story.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t imagine why something so poorly written has such amazing production value.  It&#039;s really not fair when so many other great manga have not had anime adaptations.  It&#039;s even more infuriating thinking about all the great anime that needs a second or third season.   Please put the amazing effort

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411170">
        that went into drawing this series into something, anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
tl;dr There has never been an anime with a more stark contrast between the quality of the artwork and the story.
