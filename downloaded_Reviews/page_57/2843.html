    A series based on dating. Date a Live wastes no time adapting this concept by having Shido Itsuka date various girls/spirits, earn their feelings, and kiss them to seal the deal. As a harem show, you’d expect all the girls drooling over him. While that’s partially right, it also adds additional elements because those so-called girls aren’t actually normal as part of society. Instead, they are spirits, born with supernatural powers who are viewed as a threat to their world. Date a Live II continues directly after the events for season 1. It continues to mush around its formulation of dating and turns it into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146871">
        some gimmicky show – dating becoming the solution to save the world.<br />
<br />
Based off the light novels written by Koishi Tachibana, one noticeable attribute to this adaption is the shortened length. Rather than a full one cour show (the typical 12-13 episodes), this sequel only focuses on 10 episodes adapting volumes 5-7. The main concern is rush and this should be expected. I confess to myself that the sequel is disappointing when it comes to adapting faithful material. The show decides to omit various parts to get more time for the main actors and actresses. In this case, it’s the spirits. After all, Date a Live II is a stardom for some new characters such as a pair of twins, new AST (Anti-Spirit Team) members, and even a rising idol. The catch is that some of the focus on other character are scrapped to replace their stardom.<br />
<br />
The sequel is essentially divided into two halves although the first arc has slightly less material than the second. Still, Shidou remains the focus of the show as the bachelor as he tries to save spirits and the world. The first episode has mostly anime original material but this comes off as disappointing. There’s harem antics thrown in your face fused with a whirlwind of misunderstandings. To make matters worse, the show decides to add elements from classic soap operas to appeal to these misunderstandings to somehow make them more amusing. And this comes out as dishonest as Tohka falls for every single scenario she feasts her eyes on. Neither does the initial set up show any improvement with other characters as they still want to get into Shido’s pants such as Origami. On the other hand, Shido himself has become more confident. He finds adjustment to his new lifestyle now that Tohka, Yoshino, and Kotori are living together. His relationship with these girls/spirits almost feels like a family as they give him the same pleasure as he gives them. And while the show is still regarded as a harem, the feelings the characters show are more honest and innocent especially in the case for Tohka.<br />
<br />
Comedy is indulged in this series with some welcoming aspects. While a lot of it seems repetitive, there are also other more refreshing parts such as a little gender bender not previously seen from season 1. The characters behave the way they should be with various personalities. Origami for instance is still her usual self and tries every single moment to get close to Shidou using some questionable yet amusing methods. Then, there’s the classic Date a Live gimmick: the multiple choice. While it is featured once again as a strategy to deal with runaway spirits, it has less prominence with some of the questions lacking flavor. Yet, it isn’t really what’s being asked that shows the humor but rather Shido’s way of responding.  It flirts with the idea of how Shido pretends to get attention of the spirits while methodically see how they react to them. While it makes its point effectively, it still falls under the wish fulfillment and generic tropes. By this time though, it should probably be something the audience should expect from Date a Live. Emphasis on the date.<br />
<br />
Director Keitaro Motonaga crafts his ideas from behind the scenes. Known for some of other series in the harem genre such as Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka, Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls, and the first season of Date a Live, one might question the direction of this sequel. This can come as a hit or miss especially for fans who are familiar with the material, specifically from the light novels. As mentioned before, the pacing suffers with certain elements omitted whether it would be part of the plot, humorous gags, or even character cameos. But an important factor to take notice of is the way characters are depicted. For instance, while the Yamai twins retain their personalities, the focus on them seems to be shortened with other characters. Even though Shido is the main protagonist, the subtle relationships he develops with the spirits can feel crude and stereotypical. It doesn’t even attempt to hide itself whether it’s be the fan service (such as the classic beach episode) or the seductive poses characters throw into Shido’s face. In essence, Date a Live makes the show looks itself more like a mission, to accomplish a purpose and move on. This at least applies to most of the supporting characters in the form of conquests for Shido. It doesn’t necessary develop his character or even express his personification in any ample way. <br />
<br />
But for someone like Shido, responsibility becomes part of his life. When there’s trouble, he needs to be prepared. While the first arc didn’t give Shido’s impression of this, the latter half sees an improvement with his strategies. He isn’t just more confident but also fights for beyond the scope of the mission. In retrospect, he becomes more mature and takes his job more seriously with even some admiration to see how far he goes when trying to save a friend. After all, the spirits gets stronger and his life becomes more in jeopardy. For the spirits, they offer diversity. We see a sharp contrast in their persona when comparing the first and second half of the story. Shido has to respond accordingly and think outside the box in order to prevail. He does get a little bit of help though from an unlikely ally, and one that fans adore from the first season with her yandere tendencies. <br />
<br />
Taking in the account of action, the show doesn’t cease to make this its way whether it’s aerial battles, ground level warfare, or even a battle of psychological integrity. Shido finds himself in moments of despair and desperation as events become more jeopardizing to peace. Even Kotori finds herself outmatched in some circumstances. And with new characters introduced such as Sir Issac and Ellen from the DEM industries (a military corporation for developing mecha units), you can expect a bit of clash of egos. Not only has that but characters such as Origami also found herself on the edge and in trouble throughout the season as she battles against her adversaries. Despite the mecha gears looking more suggestive though, there is credibility to the action with high caliber weapons in operation, superhuman maneuvers courtesy of the spirits, and even Shido’s risky moves. <br />
<br />
As the majority of the cast returns to the sequel, you should be familiarized already with their personalities. Unfortunately, their development lacks in terms of characterization as the show focuses more on sealing the spirits and less so when Shido isn’t on dates.  Furthermore, the fan service never ceases as the first arc is saturated with ecchi. But again, this is Date a Live we’re talking about a – franchise that pokes at fun the concept of dating to add its own ‘save the world while you get to date girls’ trite. <br />
<br />
Artwork remains generally the same as characters returning from the first season hardly goes undergoes any significant physical changes. In other words, it still remains generic as hardly anything stands out with Shido’s character design. On the other hand, the new spirits such as the Yamai twins and the idol Miku has some attractive figures. Background visuals remains stale although more lively and natural when the series takes on a beach setting. But remember that fan service never ceases whether it’s be the traditional swimsuits or the libidinous camera angles. It doesn’t cease to hide the teasing either and tires honestly to appease itself with stupidity. There are some cute moments though and decorative outfits in particular with the show’s second half that is more colorful. But overall, it’s still lacking.<br />
<br />
Although soundtrack isn’t a powerhouse, it does improve more in this sequel whether it’d be the action scenes or emotional scenarios. The bittersweet moments are focused more intensely to bring out some credibility to character relationships. Some of the dialogues may also seem cheesy but offer humor with their speech mannerisms (i.e. the contrasting tones of the Yamai twins). On the other hand, Miku’s voice feels egoistic, lacks serenity, and in general aspect sounds like a spoiled brat with annoying tones. The song she sings aren’t attractive either with her soft but squeaking style. Thankfully, the OP and ED songs has more features that makes the franchise what it is.<br />
<br />
10 episodes and that’s how Date a Live II decides to adapt the second season. The disappointment of story development in terms of a more accurate adaptation puts a stain on this show. At the same time, the fan service is like a bed bug that infests itself at any opportunity it has the chance. The first half of the season focuses on this exclusively with the twins while the second part tries out a little different with a bit of gender bender. But still, the comedy can be pleasant if you’re into the show’s gimmicks. The characters also offers something new; contrasting greatly between the two arcs but still refreshing. There’s even a favorable character that makes her ultimate return with great anticipation. But if you’re anticipating to watch this sequel, just be ready for another journey of dating sim and shenanigans. <br />

    Still new at reviews but here I go.   Date A Live 2, continues the story about Shido, who is a boy who has the ability to seal spirits, thus preventing them from doing large-scale damage, through dating them and eventually kissing them.  In this second season, the story is slow to start, but it introduces the Twins spirits and the Diva spirit, along with an inverse version of an earlier spirit (no spoilers here lol). <br />
<br />
I enjoyed Date A Live because of the unusualness of the plot.  I mean, I haven&#039;t heard of a show where a person dates someone, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145509">
        then kisses them to seal their powers before, so of course it had my interest.  Season 2 has been a disappointment for the first few episodes, but finally it has gotten back to what it was known for, which is spirits fighting, mecha suit girls fighting, dates occurring, and other things of the sort.  The art style of the show is nice because it keeps things light-hearted and not too deep, although there are a few sad moments in the show, but those few moments, are kept short and are many of the times, resolved.<br />
<br />
Sound wise, the music is great.  It&#039;s not 10/10 masterpiece by any standards, but its fitting and just sounds great, especially the opening theme.  The characters are easy to remember special in there own way.   Between the twin spirits, the Diva, Shido, the other spirits, etc. they are all memorable and in my opinion, likeable.  Personally, I like Kurumi because of her craziness and time control ability, but they each have their own little niche that they fill in character development.<br />
<br />
As I said before, the story is unique in it&#039;s own respects, and I&#039;ve enjoyed it, even though this season was much slower at starting than the previous one.  Since the show has picked up the pace and has shown more action, I&#039;ve enjoyed it more and more, although when comparing this to the light novel, the anime is flying through the story, much faster than the LN ever did.  To some, this is an issue, while for others, it helps to cut the small details and get the main story.  I&#039;m split on this but the LN is a good reads.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you liked Date A Live, then you will like this but just hang in there if you think that it is slow.  This season was largely about introducing new characters and revealing new things about older characters.   If you haven&#039;t watched DAL and think that this show is weird, bad, confusing, etc. then give DAL a shot first

    Updated: 13, July 2016<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, the momentum of an ambitious premiere is carried straight into a brick wall. Although I reserved my expectations heading into this sequel, I certainly anticipated more than ten episodes of a disgrace. Date A Live II strayed away from the merits which put its prequel on the map, such as the charms of the vivacious heroines or remarkable humor tied to a spectrum of dating simulation choices. It was only yesterday that an udon shop launched an eventful assault on the core group (en route to a local hot spring). It was only yesterday that Shidou matched wits and fists

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147331">
        against true adversity, juggling a batch of pressing demands with everything on the line. It was only yesterday that players were ripe with presence and not confined to restrictions of a dismal cause.<br />
<br />
While Date A Live&#039;s strengths permeated well through a lively bunch headlining season one, there was no vibrancy to replicate that success in this second act. The Berserk twins were pure lighter fluid to one of the most staggering time sinks I have witnessed in this genre. Was it really too much to ask for with yin-yang personalities serving no purpose other than to get Shidou hot? And as for the Diva, I hated to see her unique sexual preference and tastes overshadowed by her foully variable and one-dimensional personality.<br />
<br />
The premise for this sequel was collectively lacking in soul and impact. Most of, if not all the battles, were saturated with cheap chatter among combatants stirred together with a high concentration of pretentious drama. The most obvious misunderstandings were blown well out of proportion while new rivals and antagonist powerhouses seemingly made their appearances out of thin air. The more easygoing school events and concerts did little to support the effort or lighten the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
It would be great if the upcoming movies, OVAs, and/or TV sequels can rebound and inject Live-liness back into this series. Nonetheless, the signature trademark of the glasses schoolgirl accurately sums up this installment. It really was that lame!

    There comes a time while watching anime where you get this kind of &#039;itch&#039; that can only be scratched by a very specific genre of show, for some people this itch could be an over-the-top action show like Black Lagoon. for others it could be a good mind-fuck show like Serial Experiments Lain or Evangelion. But for me and my easily-satisfied outlook on anime, this &#039;itch&#039; is most commonly a dumb harem show with beautiful girls and a dash of action! So when I found out that one of my favourite harem was getting a sequel? Well that was all gravy for me!<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10:<br />
I&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146887">
        got to be honest, the story really isn&#039;t the strongest part of this show; which is pretty standard for the genre its from. It continues from shortly after where the first season left off, Shido is still the Spirit Pimp, Tohka is still annoying and the rest are just...there.<br />
The second season covers roughly volumes 5-7 of the Light Novel which means the introduction of two new Spirit types; the Hurricane Twins, Yuzuru and Kaguya Yamai and the Diva AKA Miku Izayoi. Of course the formula of &#039;Kiss the girl, save the world&#039; doesn&#039;t change, but the story managed to break away from the formulaic first season thanks to the personalities of the two new additions.<br />
<br />
Art - 5-8/10:<br />
I had to look this up to see if it was actually a Gonzo show because the art and animation varies so much its unbelievable, the first episode looked awful in regards to art style and the character styles in the OP urked me to the point i skipped it, i mean, what the hell was up with Kurumi? Nevermind. It seemed they focused their budget solely on the second half of the series once the new spirits where introduced and we could get into the real meat of the story. The fight scenes looked absolutely stunning with the wide range of colours creating some of the most satisfying and complimenting action scenes i have ever witnessed in a harem show (or is that not saying much? I don&#039;t know) however in the less interesting parts of the show they pulled an Evangelion and skimped wherever they could during scenes of dialogue. Another part that annoyed me was the lack of quality during Miku&#039;s live performances where her mouth wouldn&#039;t even come close to matching the sync of the song being played, its not that much of a problem as the song&#039;s themselves were amazing, but it was noticeable enough for me to mention it here.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9/10:<br />
As a Japanese speaker myself, i can openly and happily say this dub was pretty strong, Kurumi&#039;s voice actress was brilliant at nailing her slightly Psychotic yet simultaneously adorable personality, where she could switch between the two on a whim. The OP sounded beautiful despite somewhat cheesy lyrics and the ED was also pretty strong if albeit containing nothing particularly noteworthy to mention. Miku&#039;s songs made specifically for this season were a nice treat as her final song in episode 10 was one of the best songs i&#039;ve heard from within an anime show.<br />
<br />
Character - 7/10:<br />
The biggest strength and biggest problem of this show was the characters; the one&#039;s who got a lot of screen time were developed nicely despite the shortage of episodes, Miku&#039;s tsundere personality and view on men was a whole was a nice touch and amusing thing to watch considering what Shido must do to seal her powers. The Yamai twins were also great, with one having an unmoved, somewhat &#039;Rei ayanami/Yuki Nagato&#039; personality- often submissive but very calm and collected, contrasting to her abnoxious and loud twin sister who is often very reckless.<br />
The characters who weren&#039;t developed at all or any further, however, was a HUGE problem for me. The most abvious lack of development was that of the character &#039;Jessica&#039; who&#039;s motives and ambitions would have completely gone over my head if i hadn&#039;t already read the Light Novels, she was so poorly developed that i was becoming rather impatient that she was still a &#039;thing&#039; almost 4 episodes after she was introduced. Another example of poor development was that of the fan-favourite loli, Yoshino, who spent the entire first half of the season at home, irrelevant, watching TV dramas that just so happen to either match the situation going on with the other characters or predicted the future. Finally, the antagonist of the story, Westcott, was also poorly developed, but considering he is probably going to be the antagonist of the recently-announced Date A Live movie, i can kind of forgive it and respect that they didn&#039;t rush him.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8/10:<br />
I consider a Date A Live franchise as one of my guilty pleasures, i&#039;m aware that there&#039;s nothing really special to make me want to watch it, but I watch it anyway because its just pure mindless fun. The second season doesn&#039;t necessarily to as good a job as the first season but that all depends on what you expected from this show in the first place, at the time i watched this, i wasn&#039;t in the mood for anything thought-provoking and it was there to satisfy me. The character arcs were incredibly fun to watch, throwing in new twists to the typical &#039;win them over and kiss them&#039; formula that was rather refreshing and i respect Tachibana-san (the mangaka) for not rehashing the same archetypes over and over again. the ending was slightly rushed but that&#039;s what I expected after the plot twist in episode 9 so its not really affected me - especially knowing more is to come.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7/10:<br />
It wasn&#039;t a clean-cut show, in fact its pacing and execution of the arcs were poor, however, like every harem, its the characters that matter; the characters that you can really get behind and root for and the second season did the job well for the ones it did bother to develop. The music and voice-acting was on point and the story was above average for the genre its from if albeit a little too ambitious and convoluted for a 10 episode series, the show does indeed scratch the itch of a dumb fun show, and really, what more could you ask from it?

    Harems, a category of anime that involves one person of a specific gender, being surrounded by three or more members of the opposite gender, in hopes that they become the lover of the one person.  While Harems aren&#039;t the most favorite out of all of the genres of anime, it doesn&#039;t always mean that there aren&#039;t some really good ones out there.  Date A Live II, an anime in which I can safely say, is one of those few.<br />
<br />
Story (7.89/10):  For those of you who haven&#039;t seen the first season, Date A Live is an anime series that revolves around our main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146885">
        protagonist Shidou, our sixteen year old main protagonist, who has the ability to seal these otherworldly beings called spirits, who just so happen to all look like attractive/adorable human females from this world.  The main idea of the series, is that our main protagonist must seal these spirits away peacefully by no other means than by making them fall in love with him, and sealing them with a kiss.  <br />
<br />
Now, from an idea standpoint, the story is as cliched and redone as it can get, as a similar series, called &quot;The World God Only Knows&quot; has done a similar sort of story focal point already.  As far as idea originality, this series gets a six point rating at best.  But why does the story get a higher rating you ask?  That my dear readers is in the story arcs.<br />
<br />
What makes this season in particular more interesting is the way the story was written out.  Compared to its predecessor, Date A Live II has a lot more focus on its characters rather than general fanservice that other harem anime do.  In fact, I personally can&#039;t even consider this as a true harem, as only a small fraction out of all of the girls in the series actually like the guy in that way.  Each of its two story arcs give growth to the new incoming characters to the series, and to our main protagonist, making them feel a bit more real and less platonic.  While the development did feel a bit rushed, it was commendable that the writers actually spent time on making the characters more in-depth and important rather than just one here, done, another, done with its characters.  <br />
<br />
Above all, what separates this story from a good chunk of harems out there, is mystery.  THe series actually has a good mystery element that is sadly only really explored later on in the series.  There&#039;s a lot of interesting questions that need to be answered, and that intrigued me, as the story felt like it was evolving into something greater than it would&#039;ve been at first glance.  <br />
<br />
Aside from that, there were some downfalls of the series.  Number 1 is well, the first episode.  The first episode was quite a turnoff, as the actual story was really just a big misunderstanding that felt more like an OVA rather than a part of the main story.  It did introduce the first arc somewhat, but overall, felt really unessecary and probably turned off some of its fan base due to how excessively comedic (even by date a live standards) it was.  Number two is pacing.  Some of the episodes admittedly did feel a bit rushed in what they were trying to achieve, making some stuff to go along in order to advance the plot.  Given the small time frame of ten episodes, it was sad to see some details that could&#039;ve used a little bit more explanation.<br />
<br />
The ending itself felt a bit rushed.  I wish the final episode was sort of drawn out into two episodes because it felt really rushed.  It was a part of the series I was really itching to see, and to see the arc I anticipated so much become just a half episode standoff, it was quite disappointing really.<br />
<br />
All in all, Date A Live II had a pretty decent story.  It built on what it had before and made the story a lot more deeper and in depth than its predecessor, which is always a plus.  On the other hand, there were some time issues with the series that just made it shine a little less than it could&#039;ve.  <br />
<br />
Overview<br />
+  Good story arcs<br />
+  Great character development<br />
+  Good mystery element<br />
-   Disappointing final arc<br />
-   10 episodes.  (The first season was 12.)<br />
<br />
Characters (7.77/10):  The characters of this series is definitely a high point.  For every fan of this show, there is a girl that they love.  (Kurumi all the way.)  Of course, the series itself is a harem, so the gender ratios are well, a bit off.<br />
<br />
Itsuka Shidou, our main protagonist of Date A Live who has the ability to seal these creatures called spirits with a kiss.  (This guy gets quite a bit of action.)  At first glance, one could call him just an average harem lead, a guy who&#039;s nice to everyone and doesn&#039;t want to hurt anyone&#039;s feelings, all the while with several girls after his D.  (In this case, two girls.)  So what sets him apart from many other harem leads?  For one thing, he&#039;s not dense.  He&#039;s actually fully aware of the love that some of the girls in the series give him, which makes the experience of watching not so hair-pulling worthy.  (Unlike Infinite Stratos)  As the series goes on, you can clearly see him prove his worth in the series as he shows himself to be very proactive in doing his job of protecting and saving spirits.  The comical dating sim choice thing that occurs regularly in the first series becomes obsolete due to the fact that he chooses and says his own words, making his character feel all the more better.  <br />
<br />
Yatogami Tohka is the main female lead of this series.  While personally, I&#039;m not that big of a fan of Tohka, I was a bit saddened to see her role become more of a supportive one rather than a more proactive one.  Throughout the series, Tohka served little more than the role of just being there and coming in at the right time to make stuff happen.  It wasn&#039;t until the final episode where her role really shined, only to be cut in half due to the small time frame. <br />
<br />
The series on the other hand became quite focused on the three main spirits featured in this season; the Yamai sisters, and Miku.  What I can say is the fact that these three are some of the most animated and thought out characters that I&#039;ve seen in Date A Live other than the main two characters.  The reason being is because their stories are quite thought out and detailed.  Their stories made the series better on account of the fact that they grew alongside out main protagonist in terms of character development, turning into three dimensional characters that have more to offer than at first glance.  <br />
<br />
Aside from the more focused characters of the series, we have a whole slew of side characters that range from amount of screentime and importance in the series.  What I didn&#039;t like was the fact that so many characters in the series that had quite a bit of significance in the first season, had barely any significance in this season.  Kotori, who was a prominent character, was put in the backseat, along with Origami and my favorite spirit Kurumi, who had barely any screentime altogether.  While it didn&#039;t impact the series too much as a whole, I did wish I could see these characters a bit more in this season than what was given.  <br />
<br />
But what I can say was a positive, was the fact that we now have established antagonists in the series.  This season gave us some pretty interesting antagonists with motives that weren&#039;t quite clear to the characters or us, adding into the ever growing mystery of this show that I like.  It was a good addition that could only really make the show grow even more.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good character development<br />
+  Good established antagonists<br />
-   Important character demoted to supporting role<br />
-   Lack of screentime for some more important side characters<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (8.00 and 8.01/10):  The art for the series was definitely stepped up.  The visuals of the series looked fantastic and glorious, the fight scenes were crisp, fluid and amazing.  Every character looked great; there wasn&#039;t any sort of screw ups for the look of the characters.  While the art did look good, there was one big flaw, and that is, darkness.  For a good portion of the series, the show looks like Another.  The entirety of the frame in some parts of the show looked completely black and made it really hard to see what was going on.  It didn&#039;t really feel like a good experience and took away parts of the show overall.  <br />
<br />
And the required section for any ecchi show, fanservice.  Date a live, with its cast of for the most part, largely chested females, has a quite significant amount of fanservice.  Any time a spirit gets her powers sealed, their astral dress will fade, thus baring everything to our main protagonist. (I told you this guy gets some.)  What I noticed is the fact that the fanservice seemed to be downgraded, as in there wasn&#039;t as much as there was in the first season.  Because they put so much time into the plot, there wasn&#039;t as much fanservice as there could&#039;ve been, and that made the series, at least for me, a more pleasurable experience to watch.  Though there was some...unnecessary imagery that was used that I preferred not to have seen.  <br />
<br />
For music, the series came with a set of new OP and ED tracks, to me, far exceeding the original series&#039;s tracks.  The opening sounded similar to the original OP, but different enough to make me like it even more.  While it was a memorable track to me, it didn&#039;t stick out as something for a long term favorite.  The ending on the other hand was a song in a storytelling sequence.  The lyrics were that of a fairytale about a hero saving the princess, making this personally my favorite track of the whole series, as it teased about the final arc of the season, that ended up to be quite disappointing.  <br />
<br />
As for background tracks, the series reused practically all of them, from the quirky ones to the battle tracks, to my ever favorite mystical opera one that added suspense and mystery to the scene.  The background tracks are actually quite good and make Date A Live, Date a Live.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Upgraded visuals<br />
+  Good new tracks<br />
-  Unnecessary imagery in some fanservice scenes<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (9.89/10):  I&#039;m not adding personal enjoyment to the overall average score for all categories, as it will skew the results.  I won&#039;t lie, this series is a favorite of mine.  It is my guilty pleasure anime, it was my friday afternoons, it was really the first series I marathoned in an entire night when the first season was finished airing.  When I first saw that Date a Live was getting a second season, I was ecstatic, itching for the spring season to come out, as this was my most anticipated series of the season.  Coming out of it now, I can say a few things seriously.  (I&#039;m coming out of fanboy mode now.)  <br />
<br />
Date A Live is one of the better harems you&#039;ll find.  It&#039;s not the best one, but it&#039;s one of the better ones.  Date A Live isn&#039;t a masterpiece.  In fact, it has some negative feedback on some points on which I can agree on.  By harem standards, it&#039;s a good choice to watch.  By anime standards in general, you can find a lot of other things to watch.  This season did a lot of things well that made the series shine more than before, but at the same time, it did some things wrong.  If you don&#039;t mind fanservice or harems and like a decent plot that has mystery, action, and romance elements to it, then this series is for you.<br />
<br />

    This is hard for me because I am a fan of the Date A Live light novel series. It really is hard. Date A Live II was the planned second season of Date A Live and it covers Light Novel volumes 5, 6, and 7. It was only 10 episodes long which in itself was already disappointing before the series even started. The story for Date A Live is silly. Even in the first season there isn&#039;t much, but it&#039;s much better than what we saw here in this second one. <br />
<br />
Date A Live II starts the season with filler which was a disaster since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146901">
        there were only 10 episodes and the episode itself is dreadful. It then proceeds to stumble all over itself for the next few episodes and never really gets going. The 5th volume was done fairly well, but it was just boring. 6 was terrible, and 7 was good. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I can&#039;t say much about the story, but it&#039;s just dry. It lacks any punch and there is no driven plot until late in the series. I&#039;ll give it a 6/10 because though the last arc is predictable it offers some enjoyment. <br />
<br />
The real problem here is the art and animation. I don&#039;t know where to begin. Date A Live season 1 had some of the best animation of any show of 2013; meanwhile, this series doesn&#039;t have any place in 2014. The mistakes in animation are just ghastly. There is no budget for this series at all . It looks terrible and that is very sad considering the tsunako designed characters are very appealing and easy on the eyes. To not be able to capture this was just sad and ruined the entire season for me. I can&#039;t go over 2/10 for art. <br />
<br />
The sound is pretty good and soundtrack once again is pretty decent, but the use of music is extremely questionable. There are sometimes completely silent battles and it does not make sense. 7/10 for sound. <br />
<br />
Now in this season we meet a lot of a new characters, and I can&#039;t say you feel any attachment to any of them. Instead of building on what we already had in season 1 which was fairly likeable, most girls are barely even seen in favor of mediocre characters and bland plot lines. It&#039;s just not well done at all. 4/10 for character. <br />
<br />
Overall I didn&#039;t enjoy DAL II. It was one of those things that was just bad. And it&#039;s disappointing because I am a huge fan of the light novel series and the whole DAL franchise, and I love the story, but this was just done horribly. I couldn&#039;t believe it myself and I am extremely disappointed. 4/10 for enjoyment and an overall score of 5/10. <br />
<br />
<br />
Date A Live II fails to capture the same feelings of Date A Live season 1 and loses it&#039;s own identity. It gets lost in a sea of mediocrity and just when it begins to try to pick itself up it ends. A regretfully poor experience. I just wish it had been better.

    Ok, where do I start with this massive disappointment. I&#039;ll start off with saying that I loved the first Date-A-Live anime and I do not consider myself the biggest fan of this series and I have not read the light novels but this sequel was so disappointing. If this sequel follows the light novel exactly then good job but this sequel pales so much in comparison to the first one because nothing new happens! Date-A-Live II feels like an exact copy and paste of what happened in the last anime but with new spirits. Yes I know it is a sequel or second season to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166723">
        be more exact, but shouldn&#039;t sequels and especially second seasons be exploring the mysteries that the previous left behind? I&#039;m going to stop ranting and get into the review.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
 The story is exactly the same, but only with the introduction of new spirits and our previous spirits are living peacefully with Shido until the bad guys mess everything up. (I&#039;m assuming everybody that is reading this has either heard the gist of the story in the last anime or has watched this series) I understand this is a second season so it should be similar in terms of story but this is almost an exact copy of the previous story. Now is the story bad, not exactly. This is a parody series so don&#039;t expect a great story and I honestly like the twist of instead of fighting the spirits, you date them. But it&#039;s the fact that  they did not do anything new other than introduce some new spirits that become pointless in the end. They could have focused more on the origins of the spirits or Shido&#039;s power, but instead we get the exact same thing as last time. I&#039;m not sure if I made my point clear or not but I&#039;m moving on. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
One thing that is good about this series is the art. It has not changed too much from the first anime and I do like the fact it has not changed a lot because I really like the art. The colors are bright and vibrant yet dark and malevolent when need be. The characters are well drawn, and the battles are still amazing. Edit: I have just re-watched an episode and I noticed that the character designs do change slightly when shifting from different scenes for whatever, but not all the time. But still very annoying. I have bumped the score down to a 7 from an 8<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The sound isn&#039;t too great. I loved the OP, it was very catchy but that&#039;s just my opinion. The ED was decent, it has been a while since I watched it so I can&#039;t remember the song but I do remember skipping the ED song so I personally didn&#039;t like it. As for the insert songs, nothing stood out but everything felt like it belonged, again it has been a while since I watched this so I may be wrong.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
I would give this score lower if only it was based only on the new characters introduced, but the old ones do appear quite frequently (I did like the previous spirits better but I do find Tohka and Tobiichi quite annoying at times) The new spirits that appear are the twins: Yuzuru and Kaguya both controlling the power of winds. I do like these two but I felt like there introduction and getting them into the harem took way too long. And finally we have the new spirit Miku. Just like Hatsune Miku her power is her voice, most notably singing. (Coincidence, I think not) As for her character, I found her very annoying and made me want to drop this series. And there is some noticeable change  within our main Hero and Heroine Shido and Tohka. Shido for some reason gets a huge power spike out of nowhere, it is implied that it comes from his power to seal spirits but we learn nothing of that, and Tohka becomes very clingy to Shido, and she was already pretty clingy before but it felt like it has been toned up a bit. Not to mention the fact that she seems very useless, as in weak for no apparent reason and now needs to depend on Shido for everything unlike before when she could haul ass and only need Shido for food. Back on track, new characters were okay, Tohka for some reason becomes very weak and Shido becomes overpowered. In short character related stuff was okay but could have been better. Oh yeah, and the new villains are cool but needs more explanation behind what they are doing and why they are doing it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
The copy and paste story was okay when I first started watching this, because I liked how it hasn&#039;t changed but became annoyed when I realized I am watching almost the exact same thing as last time. I know what I said was a bit contradictory but my underlying point is that I don&#039;t like watching the exact same thing especially when a sequel repeats what happens before just with different characters. Another thing I did not like about this is how many times they reused the jokes from the first season. The jokes were funny at first but they used it too many times that it just got annoying.  I do like how this season there was an actual villain, but the villains motive was never explained well. In short, this had a good start but lost momentum as it progressed.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
With a copy and paste story, boring spirits compared to the first season and a plot that loses steam as it progressed, it&#039;s surprising how it gets a 6 in my book. Well with the previous spirits occasionally making appearances, especially Kurumi (my favorite spirit) who plays a big roll in the final battle, good animation and a really catchy opening saves it from complete disaster. Also it was only 10 episode, thank god for that.<br />

    Note: This review assumes you have seen the first season and might include spoilers for that season. <br />
Date A Live II continues the exploits of Shidou to seal off the spirits with a kiss. This time around the stakes are even higher and the conquests more difficult.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a huge problem with Date A Live II and that is they changed the formula of the show. It used to be a decent comedy with really good action sequences and now it&#039;s more of a show with decent action sequences with overused comedy. On top of that the &quot;Date&quot; part of the show is gone. Do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190991">
        you remember when Shidou took the girls in S1 out on dates? Doesn&#039;t happen in S2.<br />
<br />
To be fair one of the reasons there are not really dates it the difficulty in the conquests themselves this time around are more akin to the difficulty the entire cast had against Kurumi back in S1. The first conquest are twins, Kaguya and Yuzuru. The former being a tsundere and the other one of those quiet types. The other girl is Miku, whose gimmick is that she really hates men.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the cast nothing really changes. They make returns, but you might be surprised which ones actually get some of the spotlight. That said none of them make any types of growth. For the most part most things stay the same. This includes Kotori where the ending of S1 kinda made you feel like there would be some big revelation in this season. There isn&#039;t. You&#039;ll also notice I didn&#039;t even talk about the new characters in any detail. That&#039;s because what I told you is essentially their entire character. They are just kind of boring. In S1 the characters were one-dimensional but entertaining. Here they are one-dimensional and boring.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s get to the main villain, or for that matter all the villains. Like last season they don&#039;t show up until near the end of the anime but they are handled even more poorly. They don&#039;t really explain their motives or why they have to do what they are doing in the first place. That or they are simply extremely shallow.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Now for some good things. The animation is really good and flashy.Action sequences are pretty crisp, despite not being interesting. The anime also makes great use of sound effects. From a production stand point it has a lot of the flash.<br />
<br />
I know I might have seemed some what hard on the show but in all honesty it&#039;s not a terrible anime, but it is a pretty significant step down from a show that was only pretty good to begin with.

    Expecting Date A Live II to improve was probably too much. It’s obvious from the pictures that something here is going to go wrong. We already have enough goofy characters. We don’t need more. We want to see more of Tohka, Yoshino, Tokisaki and Reinne – all entertaining personalities that tend to light up any scene they’re in. Tokisaki wasn’t really defeated in the previous season, so there’s clearly more to do with her. Why add more?<br />
<br />
The additions are not that bad, but they’re bad in a very predictable way. It starts with the twins. The problem they introduce is different enough, but just look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190926">
        at them. The character design is sexy, but it’s more sexy than pretty. The previous Spirits’ design tried to tell us more about their character than to make them sexually appealing. Tokisaki is the only one with an actual sexy design, but in this case it’s part of her character.<br />
<br />
It’s not like they’re completely empty shells. They are pretty entertaining in the scenes they’re in, and the conflict they’re in could lead to a very interesting relationship. You quickly forget that they’re dressed for an S&amp;M club because their antics come from the same creative mind that gave us Yoshino’s wide-eyed fear and Tokisaki’s creepiness. Their fights are just as fun as anything in the previous season.<br />
<br />
Sadly, there is not enough of that. We spend two episodes with the twins and some embarrassing fanservice. The previous season never had that amount. What happens in these episodes feels like it came from those shows that just want to push the envelope. It’s not funny and it’s out of place. The show still rolls along mostly without ecchi – you’d expect the camera to linger on Reinne when she appears in a bikini, but you barely have time to register there’s a teddy bear between her breasts. What was the point of those awkward scenes in the bedrooms?<br />
<br />
Miku is a little better. There is something slightly off-putting in her design. Maybe it’s because she looks like Coco from Mermaid Melody with a new paint job. Still, her character is interesting and she provides a good conflict. Once you get over the over-sexualizing, the new Spirits offer problems that are different enough than the previous to show the creators haven’t run of new ideas.<br />
<br />
In fact, they have too many ideas. We have a new antagonist who is interesting until the climax. Jessica appears, which could help add some depth to the whole wing of the AST. Ellen, the Bad Guy’s sidekick occasionally looks like there is an interesting personality underneath that cool hair. There is even a school festival that slides smoothly to the plot instead of feeling tokenistic.<br />
<br />
It doesn’t build to anything. The climax is the real weak point of the series.. The previous climax was also messy, but Tokisaki lead it. It felt unhinged, out of control and unique to the series. Somewhere around the eight episode, the series becomes one extended action scene Shido mows down a lot of mooks, but the real causalties are the personalities.<br />
<br />
Some characters are already halfway to gone before the finale. Kotori and Yoshino are barely there, which makes no sense. The few times Yoshino appears, struggling with understanding a soap opera are what made the original so fun. The climax finally kills them all. Kotori and Yoshino go AWOL. The twins are pushed to the back, almost as if they were never there. Jessica is thrown into the action scene with a conclusion that deserved a much better build-up. Origami is still an unnecessary part of the harem. Miku becomes a tsundere. Bad Guy reveals he’s bad because he’s bad and Mana is still just as useless.<br />
<br />
Tohka is the only one who’s given some room to do things. Her clinginess to Shido is pretty annoying, but there’s enough of the fish-out-of-water antics that make her fun. She eventually becomes the center. If so, why introduce the new Spirits, if they’re just pushed to the back in the end?<br />
<br />
Why is this so generic? What happened to the bravery? The series used to flinch at violence, to question whether it’s a legitimate method to solve problems. It was its whole charm. It forced the hero to interact with the ‘bad guys’. Violence is frowned upon. Now Shido mows down faceless soldiers like he’s Sylvester Stallone in a generic building. There aren’t even cool visuals to accompany it. He just swings his sword and people fall down.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Shido, he hasn’t changed. He’s still boring and has no charisma. He’s still given a lot of situations that can be great for character development, and he does nothing with it. How can you even write such a dull character? Asimov isn’t exactly the master of creating human beings, but he gives the game pieces (In Asimov, there are no characters, just game pieces) some traits that make them recognizable. Shido is nothing but a plot-mover. The story is clearly about him. He’s the star of the climax this time, so make him worthwhile. Alas, everything he does is just for convenience.<br />
<br />
It’s not a problem of length. 10 episodes is a little too short, but there was enough time that was better spent on other things. We didn’t need all these fanservice and the finale could have been a bit more exciting than just killing faceless people. There is still some fuel in this franchise. Most of the new ideas that were introduced are pretty good. The new Spirits are a worthwhile addition. This season does even less with everything, and the result is just a shopping list of cool ideas. The series doesn’t deserve this as a swan song, but I worry that feature developments will stay, will, undeveloped.<br />

    The sequel to anime series Date A Live aired this spring known as Date A Live II and bought with funny moments, tragic moments and more spirits for Shido&#039;s harem while keeping the other cast members in it but are seen less than in the previous season.<br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
The story of Date A Live II focuses more on Shido defending himself and the spirits against the DEM rather than his attempts to &#039;capture/save&#039; the sprits which does have a more dramatic and interesting story to the series but in the end it felt like to me it drifted away from Shido attempting to seal the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147005">
        spirits but don&#039;t get me wrong that is still in there and is something to look forward to but it isn&#039;t as heavily focused on in this series but kind of felt rushed to me as the season was only 10 episodes.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
The opening to this season was similar to opening from the first which was good thing as I enjoyed both and was one those opening that I never skipped and watched every time, however the ending song was not as impressive and was skipped every time but then again I rarely listen to ending songs in anime.<br />
<br />
Characters - 7<br />
All your favourite characters from the first season will make an appearance in this one except with less screen time except from Tohka who appears just as much as the MC Shido does; with these characters their is very little character development so don&#039;t expect much from them but their are a few new characters introduced that are more eye catching and have more development which includes more spirits and DEM.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
I enjoyed it but is not in my top 5 of 2014 but maybe the top 10.

    My avatar says it at all who is my favourite girl in Date A Live franchise. But neither way, let&#039;s talk about the latest season of Date A Live, Date A Live II.<br />
<br />
So Date A Live II just follows the story from the first season. This sequel adapts the Light Novel&#039;s Volume 5-7 that only lasted for 10 episodes so the story is pretty rushed. And also, the first episode itself was a filler so basically, if you hate Tohka, just skip it to the second episode.<br />
<br />
Keitarou Motonaga still directs this season. Notably known for directing Legend of the Galactic Heroes, School Days and more,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146911">
        he did a good job for directing this series although there are some failures and sorts.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not kidding if I&#039;ll say the quality of the animation in this season was terrible. Sure, the fanservice scenes was kinda good but the action scene was poor animated. The last 2 episode&#039;s animation really proves that AIC Plus+ is really short in budget. So in short, the art was mediocre.<br />
<br />
A good thing about this season is the sound. Pretty comparable to Sidonia no Kishi&#039;s sounds but the main point here is when there&#039;s an action scene, I felt that it was an action scene because of the OST. sweet ARMS returns to perform the OP song &quot;Trust in You&quot;. Kaori Sadohara (who is an actual member of sweet ARMS) performs the ED theme &quot;Day to Story&quot; which is pretty good and a reliever of the show.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ll ask about the voice acting. The casts from the first season returned but I&#039;ll pinpoint Marina Inoue here voicing Tohka. I thought that she gave justice to develop Tohka&#039;s voice in this season, maturing her voice and her song performance beats up Minori Chihara songs. And going to Minori, voicing Miku Izayoi not fits for her. The truth is, I&#039;m pretty hyped for her voice but it turns out that it lacks something. Maaya Uchida and Sarah Emi Bridcut did a good job voicing the Yamai twins. But overall, I don&#039;t have any complaints besides Miku&#039;s voice.<br />
<br />
Lets go to the characters. Well, Shido took a level to become a baddass which is a good character development for him. But same old as in the first season. Still oblivious and acting like an hero wanting to save a Princess and only relies to Kotori&#039;s orders. Either way, his baddassness is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Tohka returns as your naive but a sweet Princess which I think also developed too in a way that she tries to understands Shido and its actually good for her to be honest and rather became a supporting character rather than the main character. She too, took a level to become a baddass and Episode 6 and Episode 10 managed to make her shine.<br />
<br />
Origami, Yoshino, Kotori and Kurumi just pushed to a side to become supporting characters. But if you love Kurumi, she will appear later so don&#039;t rage about it. The three new Spirits will not be spoiled for you but they are still, added to Shido&#039;s harem.<br />
<br />
Overall, a simple &#039;very good&#039; is my enjoyment in this series. There are a lot of pros and cons but still, Date A Live II is a heck of a ride for its fans and viewers. Let&#039;s wait and see the OVA and the Movie.

    The comedy and the fan service has just increased with this season<br />
<br />
Date A Live II follow volumes 5-7 of the light novels. The first half of the show deals with these competitive Yamai Sisters, Kaguya and Yuzuru, who were the same spirit until one day the two were split up into two. Now they compete with each other to prove that they are the real Yamai. They have had 99 matches (25-25-49) and there last competition is to see who can seduce Shido and he would be the deciding factor. The second half of the show is Shido trying to save a spirit called &quot;Diva&quot;,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167407">
        Miku Izayoi, but the problem is that she is bias against males because she use to be a pop star who got caught up in a false scandal after refusing to sleep with a TV producer. She later lost her voice due to psychogenic aphonia and made contact with a sprit named &quot;Phantom&quot;, the same spirit that gave Kotori her spirit powers, and regained her voice to sing again. Aside from the spirits there is a new threat called Deus Ex Machina (DEM) and I&#039;m going to be honest I forgot what their goal was, but I think it&#039;s on the lines of world conquest or something like that.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the Yamai sisters. Kaguya is very childish and has an outspoken personality. Yuzuru speaks very robot like by stating her response and then giving the actual response. Like if I said, &quot;The Giants won the World Series&quot;. She would more or less say &quot;Confirmation. The Giants did win the World Series.&quot; Miku is not only a pop star, but also she is attracted to those of the same sex making her fall for Shidou would prove to be quite the challenge.<br />
<br />
There is one joke that is set up at the beginning of the show where you could see coming a mile away and you know it&#039;s coming, but you just want to see the reactions of the characters.<br />
<br />
Once again the animation is pretty good.<br />
<br />
The one downfall is the increase in fan service. I really don&#039;t mind fan service in general, but when the show has more fan service than it&#039;s previous season it gets awkward.<br />
<br />
Date A Live II is still a very good show. This show is just a guilty pleasure for me and once again it&#039;s a show that I could just sit down and just enjoy it and not think is it as good as others say it is. So my grade for Date A Live II is 8/10.

    This anime is one of the best (if not the best) i have watched so far that has gotten me so easily intrigued in the story. I have never seen anything quite like it and I&#039;ve tried to look in a lot of places since i like this anime so much and can&#039;t wait for the new movie that is coming out.<br />

Although this season has had quite a lot less dates if any it still managed to add in some new spirits and have romantic scenes. In this season The main character Shido has gained powers from some of the spirits he

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM SEASON 1, AND MINOR SPOILERS FROM SEASON 2**<br />
<br />
*Disclaimer: The review contains heavy language and imagery; not written for pure-hearted.*<br />
<br />
Have you ever been told to just &quot;shut your brain off and enjoy it for what it is&quot;? If you have been, then you must feel like you&#039;re probably missing out on something otherworldly, something you can&#039;t quite understand. Date A Live is, in short, a figurative abomination and requires aforementioned brain shutdown sequence to even get the slightest inkling of enjoyment. I entered searching for a quick time-killing fantasy action anime with some cute waifus &amp; some harem, and I left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205191">
        literally feeling empty inside. There&#039;s nothing. All the cynicism I&#039;ve been harboring inside my heart has been purged within 22 episodes. I have nothing unique to offer to the world anymore - except this review. <br />
<br />
*NOTE: This review encompasses both seasons, as well as the overall rating of two* <br />
<br />
Shows like Evangelion, SeL, TLOGH, etc., are often put in that category of &quot;if you didn&#039;t like them, you didn&#039;t understand them&quot;. I think Date A Live deserves a spot in that bubble, to be honest. I&#039;m a firm believer that there&#039;s nothing in this world we can&#039;t understand, as long as we give it enough time and research. Yet, this show alone has broken me, has changed my very views on storytelling. This has got to be the biggest pile of massive shit the writer has ever taken on my brain since the inception of mankind. I&#039;ve read hundreds of books, hundreds of fan-fiction short stories, watched hundreds of movies, TV shows &amp; anime, and never once in my entire life did I want to put a massive fucking nuclear bomb between writer&#039;s eyes and then piss on his/hers corpse with all my might. This is a disgrace to writing. No, scratch that. This is the end of storytelling - this thing, right here. It has warranted the title of &#039;The Death of Storytelling&#039; for being the biggest shitstorm in the history of mankind. <br />
<br />
I can overlook plotholes, I can overlook deus-ex machinas, I can overlook bullshit thrown in our faces for the sake of drama/comedy/horror, but this thing here goes beyond that. At this moment I&#039;m angry with MAL because I&#039;m unable to grade the &quot;story&quot; of this thing below zero, below the levels of sanity and any conceivable comprehension. Whoever wrote this thing, I beg you, kill yourself. I fucking beg you. If you want to, I&#039;ll kill myself with you so we can both leave this world. You don&#039;t deserve neither a pen nor a keyboard ever put in your hands. You are stupider than the main girl from Aho-girl. You reached levels that even the lowest of bacterial forms have surpassed millions of years ago. Yes, that&#039;s how bad the &quot;story&quot; is. It&#039;s as if you put the story of High School DxD on acid, heroin, cocaine, crocodile, massive doses of lithium, xanax, and virtually every conceivable drug in the universe, and then took a huge steaming dump all over it, and created this. This. Fuck this to the damning hell. Burn it. Burn it before it breeds. This is the lowest level of storytelling I have ever witnessed in my entire life. 50 shades of grey seems like a masterpiece now. Twilight is the 21st ct Shakespeare. End this. Bye. I&#039;m not even going to bother jotting down the things I found to be abhorrent; if you didn&#039;t catch them yourself, or if you consider this to be a good story, you&#039;re as good as dead to me.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; sound, for the first time in my life, are the only reason I was able to finish something - and you know what? I hate myself for it. I should have dropped this in the 4th episode of the 1st season and never looked back, but I always thought it&#039;d get better. For the most part, animation is stiff and average, and even during some of the major battles I wouldn&#039;t expect much. It&#039;s colorful, yes, but it&#039;s nothing mind-blowing to be honest. It has some decent animation here and there, and I hate myself for giving props to this anime for any department, but I have to. <br />
Music is sparse, but some of it that&#039;s in there is quite good. There are 2 tracks that I still remember, and were the high point of this anime. Then why 4 to sound? Because of everything else. Sound effects were terrible, voice acting was near-unbearable, reaching dub-levels, and that randomly-thrown pop song by the end of the 2nd season sealed it for me. I&#039;m done. <br />
<br />
Now we come to the characters. The only reason I gave 2 here is because I couldn&#039;t, in my right mind, even them out with the story, because they&#039;re not that bad - mind you, they&#039;re still dreadful, just not as bad as the story. Our main character is every harem lead in the history of everything, with 0 deviation from the norm. Why do these girls like him? Because they&#039;re fucking insane and mentally challenged, that&#039;s why. There&#039;s no other reason to like him. If girls fell in love with the first guy that told them &quot;I&#039;ll save you&quot; and &quot;I&#039;ll never reject you&quot;, every low-life would have a girlfriend. This character gets no development for 22 episodes, nill, nothing. He&#039;s ever-shouting piece of plank that pathetic fuckers can &quot;relate to&quot; and &quot;immerse themselves with&quot; and he has no other purpose. You can literally switch him out with any generic harem lead and nothing would change. Abso-fucking-lutely nothing. <br />
<br />
Ooh, you think other characters are better? Think again my friend. Have you ever watched harem anime? You must have. Everyone has. It&#039;s the most widespread genre in anime. So, if you did, you&#039;ll have recognized these girls the moment they appear on the screen. Why? Because all of these are by-the-book harem girls you&#039;ve seen about a fucking bajlitionth time before, and if you aren&#039;t tired of them by now, then Lord Spaghetti help you. Energetic, shy, calm, weird, imouto, 2nd imouto because 1 wasn&#039;t enough, all these things may just as well be replaced by other things from other harems. There&#039;s so little development in this anime, that evolution of mankind was faster. You might say that every girl &quot;develops&quot; because at first they &quot;hate him&quot; and then they &quot;love him&quot;. You know what? Fuck you. That&#039;s not development you uneducated ape. Go back to school. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never seen such generic, insane and demeaning cast in any anime I&#039;ve ever watched. No, not even Sky Wizards Academy (which is still worse, by the way, only because it has worse animation; rest is pretty much on par, I&#039;d argue even better in certain places). Relinquish in this feast of stupidity and insanity, relinquish and join me in madness, for that is the only place the poor ones who&#039;ve watched this belong. <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I gave season one 5. Why? Because it was, by all means, your average harem. It had some decent action, at times it was funny, and I didn&#039;t feel like I was marathoning LoTR Director&#039;s Cut Edition each time I watched an episode. First season felt like a set-up, kind of like HS DxD, and I was fine with that. Yet, second season tried to be more than it already is and, well, you already know the result. I hope to every manmade spiritual thingy that this thing never gets any more seasons. I feel sorry for animators who had to animate this. I feel sorry for everyone even remotely involved with this outside of the writer. I feel sorry for TV stations that had to air this. I feel sorry for new anime viewers who know nothing better. Ugh ... I&#039;m done. <br />
<br />
This is abomination. End. Disgrace. Everything that&#039;s supposed to be the backbone to a creation is instead a rotten piece of shit, born only to pollute the innocent minds. Fuck. This.

    This is my first review, so please don&#039;t hurt me. Also, this is my second time writing this due to the face &gt;.(then an arrow pointing to the left) causing everything after it to be erased after submitting. Apologies on rushing.<br />
<br />
This anime needs justice, and it needs it now.<br />
<br />
Story (8):<br />
<br />
Alright, so many parts were rushed due to the anime being only 10 episodes. The first 2 or so episodes were, in my opinion, crap. After that, the anime really got its sh*t together. First off, consider all the genres this anime has. Don&#039;t expect it to <br />
have extremely good plot like other anime that don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147983">
        focus on the genres this does. Now that we got that out of the way, onto my actual thoughts.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, I would stop and think &quot;is that it?&quot;. I myself have never read the light novel or read the manga. The manga hasn&#039;t actually progressed past Shido talking to Tohka for the first time (I believe). So I can&#039;t really say that the story was great. Nonetheless, it really good for what it is. I can&#039;t delve too much on this without spiling anything, so I&#039;ll just have to say that it was excellent.<br />
<br />
Art (10):<br />
<br />
Can anyone really argue that the art isn&#039;t anything short of amazing? All the girls have their own special and unique design with lots of colors. Nothing to complain about here. The scenery is also beautifully designed and never boring. Oh, and did I mention the girls? They are just absolutely beautiful. I doubt many people would disagree on me with this. No character designs look alike (except for the Yamai sisters which doesn&#039;t count).<br />
<br />
I just love it, can&#039;t get enough of the beautiful art.<br />
<br />
Sound (9):<br />
<br />
It was nice to have Diva actually voiced by the singer Chihara Minori. Some may think her voice can be too high pitched, but I&#039;m completely fine with that. She sang the OPs (and EDs?) of Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere. <br />
<br />
The OP,in my opinion was great and memorable. I find myself listening to it from time to time. As for the ED, I don&#039;t have much to say about it since I&#039;m not a fan of music with that kind of tune.<br />
<br />
The background music is never out of place and can describe the scene well. It can set the mood for certain yanderes or a funny scene. <br />
<br />
Character (7):<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love the characters. But there just wasn&#039;t enough time to get enough airtime for all the characters.for example, the Uamai Twins didn&#039;t get much development and I was a little disappointed. If only it got 2 more episodes or they didn&#039;t mess around in the first episode, maybe, just maybe, the characters could&#039;ve been developed on much better. Just my 2 cents on that topic.<br />
<br />
The characters are very love able (Kurumi is the best girl!) and can just be soooooooo cute. Kurumi is just one of the most awesome characters (and OP) in this series.<br />
<br />
Also, drum roll please, our protagonist (Shido) grew some balls! Ironically he grew them while cross-dressing but it was a glorious moment. Can&#039;t go much more on that topic to prevent spoilers.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I found myself watching episodes 4-10 in a single sitting. I just couldn&#039;t tell myself to not watch the next episode. The suspence would&#039;ve killed me! I slept at 5 AM just to finish the anime!<br />
<br />
 Sometimeswe forget that anime is all about entertainment, and whether we enjoy it or not is what determines if it was good or not. It&#039;d be like giving a hentai a bad review solely because the story was crap. It&#039;s so we can enjoy it, no matter what flaws it had. <br />
<br />
Yes, I didn&#039;t touch up on the flaws, and it is you to decide whether you absolutely can&#039;t watch this anime with those flaws. But for me, this is my review and I&#039;m sticking to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Date a Live II, an excellent anime.<br />
<br />
This is LolCaptain signing out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*please excuse the rushed review, it&#039;s 2 AM and I really need to start watching my anime.*<br />

    Okay, Date A Live 2... The first season was good, so this should be better. Well....... I was wrong. So hyped for the 2nd season but when it came out, it was just a huge disappointment. I know that he just makes girls like him and all, but on the first season it was actually good. S2 just made it boring and not very enjoyable to watch. Huge letdown coming from an ex-Date A Live fan. <br />
<br />
I had to force myself to watch it, and it made the anime more horrible for me. If they could&#039;ve made it a bit better and more enjoyable to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383587">
        watch, maybe people wouldn&#039;t hate it. So sad to see a good anime with potential made hated because of S2.<br />

    Only two distinct words came to my mind when I was made aware of a sequel to the infamous work of Date A Live studio&#039;s magnum opus, Date A Live.<br />
<br />
Note: for the most accurate representation of my opinion, please play this music for the remainder of the review.<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYAyUfFZf3Y<br />
<br />
MOMMA MIA!!!!! WACKA WOCKA???? BONGO WONGOS??? <br />
<br />
The main cast is all back, including fan favorite MC Chad McCuckStick, on his live-threatening Earth-endangering quest to kiss a woman. The stakes are high, and the tits are large in Date A Live season 2. Immediately, the viewer is thrusted into a vicarious school-trip arc, where Chad has to undergo his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383005">
        greatest trial yet: seducing twins. The pressure refuses to let up the remaining eleven episodes - but I won&#039;t spoil the fun. Season 2 of Date A Live explores concepts simply nonexistent in the viewer&#039;s brain up until this point - what if the woman DON&#039;T want to kiss the MC? What if they aren&#039;t attracted to him? What happens if Tohka&#039;s swimsuit falls off before the thirteen minute mark in the first episode? Safe to say, this show WILL keep you on your toes.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the intelligently superior, Date A Live continues to deliver with subtle opinions on controversial political topics. I enjoyed how Date A Live cruelly depicted the power of influence and the harsh consequences it can bring. It can be easy to miss this dialect given the nature of the show - I believe this could be commentary on how sexual tension can become causation for a loss of focus, but this is a thought train for my doctoral thesis.<br />
<br />
In any matter, no matter if you are blind or deaf, this is a show you cannot miss.

    This was actually a very disappointing series, especially after all the buildup from the first season. First thing that struck me was the change in art, which, for me, was very unwelcoming. The opening soundtrack was, undeniably very good (as expected from SWEET arms), and the closing wasn&#039;t bad either. <br />
<br />
The second season was meant to be the general plot development season, however, the studio was too disorganized and couldn&#039;t notice that it was beyond their budget. They had to kill the story off right when the main plot twist was meant to happen and they spent too little time developing and concentrating on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review157333">
        different characters, I read the light novel, and most of the details were left out.<br />
<br />
I heard that the studio is going to make a movie to finish it off, so if you ask me, just save this season for when the movie comes out.

    Date a live season 2 is the sequal of the hit harem, mecha, romance, sci-fi anime, it continues directly after the event of the first season, and doesn&#039;t waste any time it immediately jumps into its lackluster first arc, and ends of with a banger of a second arc. It only has two arcs, and only ten episodes unlike its predecessor and it&#039;s next season who both have 12 episodes. Certain characters get sidelined like Yoshino, the Yami twins after their arc, Origami, Mana and Kurumi barely gets any screen time, in favor of the Diva and the DEM sideplot , which honestly feels convulated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347860">
        and unecessary like at least give us some explanations to why you&#039;re doing all this shit, then at the end we get another form of Tohka that is a completely different spirit, and Shido saves the day with dates and kisses. Honestly tho that first arc sucks, its barely detailed, and it only last to episode 3 or 4 don&#039;t remember at the top of my head. I legitimately don&#039;t give a crap about the Yamai twins I don&#039;t hate them but I don&#039;t like them, and I would be pretty happy if their arc was actually good, but it wasn&#039;t so I think they hold this season 2 back. The second arc was kind of a banger tho, The Diva is a really interesting spirit, the fact that she&#039;s lesbian, forces Shido to crossdress just so he can interact with her and that she can control people, it felt like something new, it wasn&#039;t just see spirit, date spirit, seal spirit, while she does have a pretty standard backstory, for some reason it just works, and it makes me care more about her than the Yamai twins. This second season is definetely worse than season 1, it&#039;s only salvaged by its second arc, if it weren&#039;t for it I would have given it a 5/10.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-Great artstyle and animation<br />
-Great second arc<br />
-More Tokha, even tho after all that I still feel the same about her like I did in the first season, still think they could have emphasised her a little bit more.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-The characters that you care about are sidelined except for Tokha<br />
-The first arc was not well executed and very lackluster<br />
-Ed wasn&#039;t good<br />
-Introduction of a convulated villain sideplot, like I know it&#039;s a sideplot, and that it&#039;s only ten episodes but can I get some info on Westcott and Ellen, I have no idea what their trying to achieve, and if their good villains or not.<br />
<br />
Overall Date A Live season 2 is a inferior product to its predecessor, with it&#039;s lackluster first arc, and convulated villain sideplot, the show got carried by its second arc for christs sake, I don&#039;t care about the Yamai twins, better characters like Origami, Yoshino, Kurumi are sidelined in favor of new characters that aren&#039;t all that looking at you Yamai twins, diva is fine I guess. I would be lying tho if I said I didn&#039;t enjoy this show, now would I recommend it to people, not really only watch this if you&#039;re a Date A live fan or enthusiast, otherwise don&#039;t bother with this and the third season. I give Date A Live Season 2 a 6/10 for my overall anime score.

    I watched the first season and absolutely loved it. I was a little against the mecha genre, but this anime has a really good balance between mecha, school, and harem. With this second season, I enjoyed the advancement in the plot and relationships. Although the plot is nice, some of the major plot points came out of nowhere and still confuse me (introduction of characters, the cause of major plot points like the ending). I really enjoyed the music in the anime especially in the final scenes of the last episode. Overall, if you enjoyed the first season, then the second season is the same.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215719">
        I hope for some OVA or hint at a next season, because the last episode just drops a plot point and ends it right there.
