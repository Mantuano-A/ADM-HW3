    Hi, <br />
<br />
Before I start reviewing the anime I would like to say watching this first will not help understand the story, so it&#039;s best to watch the first season first before even reading/watching this anime or manga. <br />
<br />
Story - (Rate - 8) <br />
<br />
The story is about the eighth card which appeared on the map what Rin holds within her possession which shows some form of constriction during the end of Prisma Illya 2Wei. (It is a continuation). With this part of the story, I feel as if the series is beginning to pick up and adapt itself to more serious scenarios relating to possibly the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201438">
        Fate route or possibly the UBW Route. It&#039;s showing much promising results as it&#039;s not just about the fan service anymore, it&#039;s more about the action. <br />
<br />
The reason why I rated it an 8 is because from episodes 1-6 it&#039;s more Slice of life rather than battles, however that balances the series out of just being full of action. It is meant to have comedy and fan service, but because of the normal slice of life and fighting it balances everything out. It didn&#039;t score 10 because of the somewhat suffocation of the fan service it has to offer, but as the story progresses the entire fan service part just vanishes and focuses on the main battle, which is why it&#039;s at 8. If it focused more on Fan service it would have been lower. <br />
<br />
Art - (Rate - 10)<br />
<br />
What do I really have to say about the Art? Seriously? The art is AMAZING. It&#039;s basically on par with UFO Table&#039;s adaption of Fate/Stay Unlimited Blade Works or even better, which I appreciate over all! The amount of effort and pure work they put into the series was phenomenal. I really enjoyed how the animation flowed and fit perfectly with the scenes. There was nothing wrong with the presentation of each episode, and they were all the highest quality in my eyes. <br />
<br />
The best bit about the art was the eyes and the action. The fighting scenes were amazingly designed and animated, it made my view on the Prisma Illya line better than somewhat of Unlimited Blade Works, though both similar in Art design. <br />
<br />
Sound - (Rate - 10) <br />
<br />
What is there to say about all of the sounds? The voices were perfectly in sync with each and every character that existed in the Prisma Illya line, from season 1 to 3. It&#039;s amazing how they can perfectly match the character voices and make it work like that. The only one character which I didn&#039;t really like was Tatsuko, as she was slightly annoying in the series, but her voice actor was good and matched the childish side of Tatsuko. Over all, the voice of Miyu and Illya was perfect for the roles, which I think deserve some recommendation for their hard work and determination to make their characters sound amazing. <br />
<br />
The music for this season was amazing as well, they all fit into the scenes and flowed when drastic changes occured in the episodes (this was at the start of episode 7 to 10). <br />
<br />
The opening for season 3 was awesome, I really enjoyed the way it sounded, and I would definitely have it on my phone to listen to it. The ending was just as good! I think all of the OSTs used in this series deserve to be listened too. <br />
<br />
Character - (Rate - 10) <br />
<br />
All characters in this line deserve to be at 10, because of the development throughout the three seasons it&#039;s built up to this. Tatsuko is a different story as she has always been this annoying little girl who can&#039;t stop herself from running and being hyper, but aside that downfall the character for Illya has developed massively since the first season, from being a coward to now having the ambition to fight and do what she can to protect those she cares about. Her character development began at the end of Season 1. <br />
<br />
Miyu was just as good as Illya, but in Season 3 her character had developed further than we all expected, from being cold and quiet to being sociable and friendly toward others. The creators of the Prisma Line really wanted to make those two characters stand out over the rest. <br />
<br />
Rin and Luvia haven&#039;t changed much since the first season, so no real point in saying they had their characters being development, though they do get along much more in this season. <br />
<br />
For the final character I want to mention who really caught my attention during the last half of season 2 until now is Chloe/Kuro. Her character from season 2 was murderous, but after things changed she had a warm heart toward Illya and Miyu, caring for the friends she holds close to her. In my opinion, I feel like Kuro had the most character development from the second half of 2wei to Herz. If you plan to watch this anime then keep an eye on Kuro more than the other two, but personally all three stand out the most. I love this series due to the development of the main 3 characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - (Rate - 10) <br />
<br />
I really, REALLY enjoyed this anime because of the mix of comedy, slice of life and action that it has to offer. Of course I feel that the Slice of life comes on a little too much even for me, but as it gradually goes deeper into the episodes that disappears slowly which brings me back to watch it. For others who have only small patience, it can change their view on it and say it&#039;s bad. Trust me, once you watch the anime and notice how the plot changes it will catch your attention like it did me. <br />
<br />
The best bits of the anime I enjoyed the most was the comedy and character development as it was funny yet very interesting to watch. If I could watch this again, I would definitely do so. <br />
<br />
Over all - (Rate - 10) <br />
<br />
I think that this anime should be watched especially if you love Illya from the Fate/UBW route. To me, the anime took a turn for the better as it brings in a more serious feel to the battles which makes it better than UBW in some aspects. Season 4 is announced for next year and I&#039;m pumped for it. If you need an anime to watch, the Kaleid Prisma Illya series is for you. <br />
<br />
I hope it helps anyone doubting this series due to it being a spin off.

    With all the shows that have been airing, I would like to draw attention to Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei Herz! which happens to be a good stand-out anime for anyone with patience. This review is based on the 7 episodes that have aired so far and may not be relevant by the time the show ends.<br />
<br />
(MINOR SPOILERS may be present)<br />
<br />
Story (7/10):<br />
This series adapts the second half of the Fate/kaleid liner Prisma ☆ Ilya 2wei manga and continues from Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei where the main characters have to deal with the mysterious Eighth card. The reason why the score is rather low here as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198274">
        first 6 episodes are mostly slice of life filler that, while not awful for the most part, may overstay its welcome for some. They are fun to watch though and some even foreshadow the involvement of certain characters while highlighting the strength of the main characters&#039; bonds towards each other. The fanservice that does appear however does make it difficult for non-regular viewers to continue watching though said service does fade away in time and can detract from the main story at times. The latest episode at time of writing however brings the plot back into focus and already it brings in great plot escalation along with intense battles (that are arguably equal to or better than ufotable&#039;s UBW in terms of escalation, tension and intensity). Since the show is still ongoing, a review of the story cannot be completed until it is fully shown. As for now, the story is neither bad nor amazing but stuck in the middle territory.<br />
<br />
Art (8/10):<br />
Silver Link has chosen to use the same style of art as the preceding series with minor improvements (at least from what I can tell). This is not a bad thing here as the bright and colourful art style fits a story about magical girls that attempt to be optimistic in the face of a dangerous hidden world. The character designs also fit this design by being adorable with hints of a tease but not being too adorable that the action looks peculiar with said designs. The latest chapter has eschewed the bright and colourful art style for a darker art style to show the change in tone as the characters confront a new threat that they are to combat with lethal consequences should they fail.  Without wishing to spoil, the effects for the latest episode (at time of writing) is brilliant and is able to portray the intensity of the battle to a good degree. There is some CGI work done in the latest episode that is somewhat jarring though not to the extent of a eyesore. Overall, without wishing to spoil, the art is decent enough to portray the characters as they are in that setting while providing enough of a spectacle to keep viewers entertained especially in the action sequences.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10):<br />
As for this category, the voice actors are excellent in portraying their characters as each of them convey the emotions of their characters without any issues. It was fun to watch the many exasperated shrieks of Ilya and Miyu&#039;s deadpan reactions to the many comedic antics in the first six episodes while the rest of the cast portrayed their characters to the best of their abilities (special credit to Bazett&#039;s VA for being able to be both comedic and badass when appropriate). In addition, the soundtrack used is well in conveying the slice of life scenarios and the intense battles with old favourites from soundtracks from prior works even returning as easter eggs or actual tracks in the series. The new OP song is rather nice on the ears and as of now, two different ED songs have been revealed which acknowledges the progression of the story. As a whole, the voice acting, soundtrack and songs are rather good and are able to convey the tone of the story as it progresses (at least for now).<br />
<br />
Character (9/10):<br />
The meat of this series lies with the characters who are entertaining to watch. Ilya and Miyu are still fun to watch with their reactions based around exaggerated and barely existing emotions being present while Kuro, being a tease, provides the fuel for more hilarious scenarios. Other regulars such as Rin, Luvia and the two Kaleidosticks perform their routines for the slice of life bits with enough of their positive traits being portrayed for the narrative-relevant parts. When the story becomes more serious however, these comedic portrayals are reduced and their own serious traits surface, showing a deep bond between them. Joining the series as a regular is Bazett, who is able to balance her role as both comic relief and a hyper-competent combatant, is always fun to watch whenever she becomes one or the other. Her methods of facing her current reality in the series was a highlight for me when watching this show. My only complaint here would be the character of Tatsuko, as her many antics can get annoying and is worsened by her many appearances in the slice of life segments. The remaining characters (too many to list) are decent and do not overstay their welcomes while being able to provide comedic entertainment and for some, intrigue. As of now, the characters are fun to watch and have depth that hints at further developments with focus on one in particular.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
While the slice of life may overstay its welcome at times, it does not stop it from being entertaining and intriguing in establishing the level of depth for the character&#039;s relationships. The gags that appear in the show provide fun references for Type Moon fans and have enough substance (both visually and in dialogue) to bring a great level of enjoyment. The fanservice moments are a mixed bag but at least are infrequent. At time of writing, episode 7 has allowed the plot to progress, bringing amazing effects, fast-paced action with actual intensity (and methodology explained) and dramatic tension. The Eighth card is certainly not a disappointment to watch (the identity of said card will not be revealed here to avoid spoilers). Hopefully, Silver Link can maintain the quality they have produced in episode 7 for the remaining episodes in the season.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10): <br />
Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei Herz! is a very good follow-up series to Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei! that brings enough entertainment to keep viewers sated until the plot continues. When it does, the escalation brings about action sequences that are a welcome treat for most viewers and will keep viewers on their seats as they wonder how it will end. It is a solid show for this season and worth a look at least going from episode 7. Hopefully Silver Link maintains the level of quality that episode 7 was able to produce or else, future reviews here may not be as favourable.<br />
<br />

My favorite card game is called “Texas Hold ‘Em.” In this gambling game, the dealer deals two cards to every player. Then the flop (three community cards), the turn (one community card), and the river (one final community card) are dealt by the dealer. Betting occurs in-between each of these rounds.<br />
<br />
The objective of the game is to make the best set of cards possible – three-of-a-kind, a straight, and so on – with the two cards you own and the community cards. The catch is that each player can only see their own cards. What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213044">
        this means is that the winning hand is not always the winner; a player can and often does bluff their way to victory. And so the saying goes: “you gotta’ know when to hold ‘em and know when to fold ‘em.”<br />
<br />
I am talking about cards because I am talking about Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei Herz!, which is somehow even more ridiculous of a title than Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei!. Herz (as it will be called from here on out for sanity purposes) is about finding a final card that Illya and the gang need to acquire. Alongside the secrecy of the plot, the show sort of (read: barely) becomes a game of Texas Hold ‘Em, but this show’s poker face is easily seen through.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
On a narrative level, Herz takes a different direction compared to its previous two seasons. Rather than intertwining the slice-of-life and action halves – like it has always done – the anime almost completely separates the two.<br />
<br />
The first half (technically the first three-fifths) is all slice-of-life. Illya, Miyu, and Kuro live the lives of everyday girls: a trip to the beach, going on all the rides in an amusement park, and visiting a nighttime festival are just some of the ways that the girls have fun together. There are scenes that allude to the more dramatic content, but these are very small and irrelevant until later in the anime. In fact, the show focuses so much on the slice-of-life aspect that the series more or less deviates from its magical-girl-parody roots; very rarely, the anime uses its magical-girl motif. This is not a negative so much as it is a clear indication that Herz was looking to take the series in a new direction.<br />
<br />
Their close friends from school – Tatsuko, Nanaki, and so on – also come with them on these various outings. This gives them a lot more presence than they have had in the past. In fact, an entire episode is dedicated to Mimi, one of these side characters, where she enters the world of “boy’s love” material. By focusing on their friends more so than usual, Herz once again puts emphasis on the slice-of-life portions of the show.<br />
<br />
Whether or not this new direction worked, however, is another matter entirely. On the one hand, framing the narrative as solely slice-of-life followed by solely action puts Miyu’s plight into perspective. Watching her interact with her friends and having the time of her life before everything starts to fall apart is meant to make it clear that where she belongs is not within a place of despair but right next to Illya and the others who hold her dear. On the other hand, doing nothing but slice-of-life for so long makes the transition from cutesy fun to brutal reality a bit too jarring. The previous seasons did not have this problem because the two halves were mixed.<br />
<br />
Separating the slice-of-life and the action so much does incur a penalty. Putting everything at the front that is not the main conflict has the inherent problem of lacking direction, intentional or not. The previous season already made it apparent that there was another problem to solve – finding an eighth card – so when the anime essentially brushes off the problem for so long, the problem does not feel as dire, the problem does not feel as important. Again, Herz does reference the main conflict occasionally, such as at the beach with the giant drill and at the amusement park with the presence of their school’s “nurse.” But since these small asides are not at the forefront, the conflict is also not at the forefront, thus causing a loss of importance.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, the second half has the issue of being unclear. Like the second season, the show has a hard time fully explaining why the events are proceeding as they are. Parallel dimensions and unknown summoning rituals are presumably the cause for the drama, but these explanations are cloaked behind information dumping and assumptions. The massive amount of slice-of-life segments further makes the second half unclear. Spending time on Illya and her family inside a much-too-small swimming pool provides less time for the anime to explain what is actually happening.<br />
<br />
While the narrative itself might be unclear, it is very clear that the narrative is the weakest part of the show.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
For a spin-off series, Herz has some surprisingly strong art and animation.<br />
<br />
While the background art and location details are nothing impressive – Illya’s home is a common location, and the battles take place in open, plain environments – it is the other artistic choices that are. The positioning of the camera. The choreography of the fight scenes. The lighting and the shadow details. A lot goes into making the scenes as spruced up as possible, more so than an anime of this caliber normally gets.<br />
<br />
Herz also loves its reaction faces that add to the comedy of the show. Mimi flabbergasted at what Shirou and Illya are about to do or Illya getting a giant head with a dumbfounded expression are exaggerations that compound the hilarity of the scenes.<br />
<br />
The actual animation is likewise high in execution. Characters regularly see hair and body movements that add realism to the scenes. Other effects, like glowing trails, sparkling eyes, and the motion of roller coasters further make the anime as dynamic as it is. And the fight scenes are just as noteworthy. Lots of jumping, flying, and gem-throwing, as well as slow-motion segments and fist-fighting. While there is not as much battling in this season as there were in previous seasons, the battles are as visually impressive as they always have been.<br />
<br />
Herz also uses CG, usually for the more intense sequences. Episode seven has a lot of examples, like the swirling black clouds of the enemy or Rin’s “Thor’s Hammer” battery ability. For these extra, special effects, the CG is not off-putting, but it is off-putting for the antagonists. Both the eighth card villain and the final, giant demon are CG, which makes some of their movements a bit too rigid and therefore out-of-place among the rest of the normally animated sequences.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the character designs are well-done. The eyes of the characters, especially Illya, Miyu, and Kuro, are glistening fonts of color. Their hair, too, is stylized without feeling overbearing. And they also constantly change their appearances, from casual clothes to yukatas to their magical girl outfits. Even the rest of the cast see the same attention to detail in their designs and attire, as well as having quirks of their own.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Herz makes a lot of odd choices with its characters this time around. Choices that ultimately reduce the execution of the show significantly.<br />
<br />
Bazett, the “Berserker woman,” is one of the more obvious. Before, Bazett was nothing short of a villain. She was the adversary to Illya and Miyu, going so far as to thwart their plans and steal their cards for herself and her own organization. In this season, however, she is no longer the antagonist but instead a comedic tool. Her previous escapades have put her in massive debt, so she is constantly forced into situations to make money: selling popsicles, working as a mascot, and running a game stall. To be fair, the contrast of seeing this juggernaut fighter in such pitiable roles is funny. The expense (pun intended) is that she loses the qualities she already had since she goes from an evil brawler to a debt-ridden woman. So it not so much that she changed her character, it is that she became somebody completely different.<br />
<br />
Tatsuko does not have her character change but she does get time in the limelight. So much time, in fact, that she steals it from many of the other characters. For whatever reason, this season puts a lot of emphasis on the rambunctious kid. Her interactions with the rest of the cast, her crazy behavior, and even the rest of her family are shown. All of these details are done as jokes. For example, when her family is introduced, the characters note how Tatsuko has become the “main character,” to which Tatsuko responds with a philosophical statement that is unlike her. Again, like Bazett, using Tatsuko for comedy is fine, and giving so much on-screen time to Tasuko makes her more of a character than just a hyper little girl. But so much focus on her (and other side characters like Mimi) takes away from the ones who need it most, namely Kuro, Miyu, and Illya<br />
<br />
Kuro especially has little presence within the season. Outside of her kissing scenes and her teasing of Shirou, she more or less sits on the sidelines. The biggest example is the conflict between Illya and Miyu. Rather than trying to mediate the two when she is aware of the disconnect, she just lets them figure it out on their own. It is not until the final fight that Kuro is motivated enough to take action, action she takes because Illya had finally decided to be the friend to Miyu she should have been all along. Kuro’s refusal to help until Illya decided to makes sense, but Kuro’s character is still a bit contradictory: she is being a good friend by not being a good friend. This is weird because not being a good friend is the main conflict between the characters. So in a way Kuro’s contradiction contradicts the anime’s theme on friendship.<br />
<br />
The entire first half centralized this theme: the anime, with its slice-of-life events, highlighted the fun times and relationships the friends had together. Yet all of these happy times were avoiding the problem in a similar fashion to Kuro’s own active avoidance. The result is that Illya and Miyu avoided the problem as well. Illya did not pry into Miyu’s life since Miyu was unwilling to share more about herself, and Miyu did not divulge her past since that would have meant hurting the relationship she already had with Illya. In short, Illya and Miyu distract themselves to prevent confronting each other.<br />
<br />
A lot of the trepidation is caused by Miyu’s social ineptitude. As the first half of the season shows, she does not have a firm grasp (still) on common activities such as hitting a beach ball in the ocean or how festival stalls are more about the fun than they are about the money. As such, she not only has difficulty expressing herself but she also has difficulty understanding Illya’s feelings. So when Miyu accepts her “destiny,” she does not do so to hurt Illya, she does so because she does not want to hurt her best friend anymore. The revelation of her origins is presented awkwardly as more information dumping, but in the end, Miyu learns that she is, as Illya puts it, “not alone.” She learns that friends are meant to be there for one another. She learns that friends are people to turn to when the going gets tough. And considering the magical girl motif, friendship saving the day is as fitting as can be.<br />
<br />
After Kuro and Miyu comes llya, who is a lackluster protagonist if only because she, like Kuro, does not say or do too much. She is kind and plays the straight man for nearly every joke, so for the slice-of-life segments it works out fine. But her narrow range as a character does not transition well into the dramatic segments. It is not until the very end of the season – where she goes to extreme lengths to save Miyu – that she is finally tested and pushed out of her comfort zone. Yet even this ordeal does not amount to anything. Despite the characters clearly warning Illya of the danger she was putting herself in, she comes out of the situation unscathed. So while Illya is a competent character for the comedic segments, she is a failed character for the dramatic ones.<br />
<br />
Collectively, the characters are a lot less than ideal, even given that the theme on friendship is fitting for the show.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening theme for Herz is quite strange. It combines mellowness and adrenaline into one piece, matching the show’s own split story. The various instruments and hopeful feel of the track are nice, but it is the wonderful vocalist that steals the spotlight entirely. Despite this, the track is not that catchy, making it not worth listening to outside of the show itself.<br />
<br />
The second ending theme chooses the feeling of the story’s second half, creating a track with a lot of emotion and heaviness. And once again, the vocalist does an impressive job of conveying these same feelings. Coincidentally, the second half of the track is incredibly powerful, but the first half is only marginally so, which is enough to make the track one that is only played while watching the anime.<br />
<br />
The first ED, for balance purposes, chooses the feeling of the story’s first half. It is a ton of fun, with silly sound-effects and instruments, as well as a fast beat that befits the quick-natured pace of the comedy. This track matches the slice-of-life-ness of Herz extremely well, making it arguably the best part of the anime after its art and its animation.<br />
<br />
The rest of the soundtrack follows the same theme as the story and the EDs: one half slice-of-life and one half drama. The lighter tracks include tropical tunes, fast country pieces, and guitar-heavy compositions. The heavier tracks include ominous tunes, depressing pieces, and violin-heavy compositions. The OST is nothing special, but it does, at the very least, fit the tones of the anime throughout the season.<br />
<br />
Finally, voice acting performances are generally above average. Mai Kadowaki as Illya gives the young girl a unique-sounding voice. Kaori Nazuka as Miyu gives the “Holy Grail” girl as emotionless of a voice as possible. And Chiwa Saito as Kuro uses a childish, teasing voice that fits the carefree semi-twin nicely.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
My favorite characters in this series are Liz and Bazett. I like Liz because she is attractive and I like Bazett because seeing her running around and kicking major butt with just her fists and her feet is awesome to behold. Unfortunately for me, I did not get a lot of both. I did get to see Liz in a bathing suit (which was nice) and I did get to see Bazett throw a few punches (which was cool). Yet that was the extent to which I got to see my favorite characters.<br />
<br />
Now, this is not to say that the anime was boring for me to watch when they were not around, which is hardly the case. As a comedy, the show is pretty solid. Illya’s reactions were funny, especially when Kuro teased her when Shirou was around. The other characters’ shenanigans were funny, too, like when Mimi’s ear was flapping while she was eavesdropping on Illya and Kuro “transferring mana.” The jokes could also be witty: Shirou commenting on why Rin dresses the way she does after being injected with truth serum is a meta joke on Rin’s way-too-short skirt. I just wish there was more of Liz and Bazett since I prefer them over the other characters.<br />
<br />
The fewer amount of battles this time around was also disappointing, as were the antagonists. The group squaring off against a dark blob and a giant just did not have that same sense of evil, that same sense of urgency. Or this might just be me still perturbed that Bazett was not the villain this time around. Furthermore, I cannot say that I like Miyu a whole lot, meaning her plight did not emotionally move me. The result is that the second half, with its lame fights and its boring drama, is definitely not as fun or as entertaining as the first half.<br />
<br />
Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei Herz! is more of the same but not quite so. The new direction of the narrative does not work, the characters are poorly handled, and the latter half of the show is not as powerful as it could have been. The art and parts of the music are well-executed, and the comedy of the first half works well-enough, so the anime is not a total wash. Even so, if the hand I was dealt in Texas Hold ‘Em was as weak as this show is, I would follow the mantra and fold immediately.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Bad, separating the slice-of-life and dramatic halves has purpose, but the jarring switch, the loss of conflict, and the unclear events hurt the narrative<br />
<br />
Animation: Good, cool artistic direction, above average actual animation, nice character designs, shoddy CG<br />
<br />
Characters: Bad, Miyu is okay at best, and the theme on friendship has merit, but the downgrade to Bazett, the over-focus on the side characters, Kuro’s contradictory characterization, and Illya being a poor main protagonist are too much to overlook<br />
<br />
Sound: Fine, okay OP, good first ED, okay second ED, okay OST, above average VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fine, the comedy was funny, but the latter half is boring, and there needed to be more Liz and Bazett<br />
<br />
Final Score: 4/10

    Continuing where the original 2Wei left off, an eight card has been discovered beneath the ground, and the girls&#039; mission gets an extension so they can collect it. The problem is that since it&#039;s just one card this time, it naturally can&#039;t take too much air time to make a season on its own. And that means one thing: fillers.<br />
<br />
Normally it wouldn&#039;t be bad, I mean the ova episode was actually pretty good, so naturally you would think it wouldn&#039;t be too tough for the studio to make a few more of them.  But the fillers just felt... Lacking. What was missing? FANSERVICE. Oh...

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200299">
        What&#039;s wrong animation studio? Without mama Manga-chan to back you up you aren&#039;t sure what you can get away with? It&#039;s Fate Kaleid morons, you got away with 9-year-olds playing very questionable games in the bath, a shot of them in bikinis or underwear won&#039;t get you off the air at this point. Others might view it as a minor issue, but I honestly can&#039;t get over the fact that we went through AN ENTIRE BEACH EPISODE WITHOUT FANSERVICE. I mean, come on! Are you even trying?!<br />
<br />
The annoying part is that in MANY cases throughout the fillers it&#039;s clear that they were originally going for fanservice paradise (string bikinis prepared for each of them, Illya&#039;s clothes disappearing in the carnival episode etc etc) but at the last moment they backed down. Hell, even Kuro&#039;s mana needs were completely ignored during the fillers. And if the entire season went on like that it would be fine, I&#039;d say they turned a new leaf. But right at the first episode we have UNNECESSARY amounts of fanservice, so what the hell?!<br />
<br />
Regardless, the animators obviously had to find something else for filler material, so instead we get them hanging around with Illya&#039;s classmates whose names you never bothered remembering and whose faces you simply never wanted to see. Especially Tatsuko becomes purely annoying from a point onward, making you sigh in disappointment every time she appears on screen. But hell, even that would be acceptable IF at least the humor was good. But like with the fanservice, all you will see throughout the fillers are wasted chances at things that would actually be really funny, instead replaced by Tatsuko&#039;s narcoleptic gags and other uninspired slice-of-life humor.<br />
<br />
Luckily the last episodes (main story) save it. Big hard battles, hopeless situations, tear-jerking drama, jaw-dropping animation, etc etc, you know the drill. It&#039;s what&#039;s Fate Kaleid was and always will be good at. Like a kitten, despite the mess it created earlier, it&#039;s hard to stay mad at it when it meowes ever-so-cutely at the last minute. Just keep Tatsuko locked in a box and we&#039;ll all be happy again. Preferrably one buried beneath the ground. And with a cross on it.

    This review is sum up of three seasons of the anime:<br />
<br />
Another mahou shoujo huh? Actually, I’m reluctant to watch it because I’m expecting it become more cute and lyrical and, the truth punch me so hard that I’m watching it like crazy since I have finish it with 3 days. It was seriously amazing show although it was a spin off in fate series but it performs better in terms of magical genre series.<br />
<br />
The story focused on Illya who just regular elementary school wishing to become mahou shoujo, but suddenly the magical stick called Ruby granted her wish and the fate has come to this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213652">
        girl to collect the class cards and meet circumstances around her. The story seems kind off plain but I can assure that each episode will make your seat uncomfortable. Since this is the spinoff, you might be able to recognize some people like Shirou, Rin and even our protagonist, Illya, and, with other event like class card as you progress through each episode/season.<br />
<br />
The animation, what can I say is totally superb and amazing. I don’t really think mahou shoujo genre combined with action-pack non-stop will be a good combo. But, Silver Link did an amazing job to manage the animation especially the fighting scene. Man, that’s one of the best jaw-dropping fighting scene that makes you think, “I’m expecting more blast from magic fighting not with sword clash or fist fight but hey,  this is freaking awesome”. To be honest, it was splendid and I can’t get enough of it although you might need to endure some of embarrassing stuff (you know, right?). <br />
<br />
Since this is a spin off series, I’m not expecting the most of character didn’t have a lot character development but it turn out I’m wrong. You don’t expecting the series was like other magical girl who beats new villain in each episode/season or takes up entirely season to take the enemy and call it a day. No, in Fate Kaleid Illya, each story has a connection and since it also involve of fate series. So, if some of you who already watch one of fate series, it might not be hard to understand some situation, but, it may be a little bit overwhelm for those who don’t. Don’t worry, just take your time and you will understand the story as it not that much hard to digest.<br />
<br />
The OST, well the production did a good job handling the OST especially with battle scene with the hype when watching the fighting scene. The OP and ED are also good to hear as well. It suits well and the arrangements of the songs are corresponding with each season since it will become more serious in each season.<br />
<br />
The conclusion, in my opinion, this may be the best of the best among spin off series that I have ever watch. The story, animation, character are all perfectly combined and I’m really enjoying the show. There is no episode that I didn’t laugh, sad or awe and that combo made me to give that 10/10 for this series. I seriously do hope for another seasons and it seems it will come soon.  So yeah, I’m really looking forward to it.<br />

    Reviewer&#039;s note: This is my 8th entry into the Fate/Kaled spin-off works (Ilya&gt;Specials&gt;Sekka no Chikai&gt;Undoukai de Dance!&gt;2wei&gt;Specials&gt;Mahou Shoujo in Onsen Ryokou).<br />
<br />
<br />
✪ Genre: action (swordplay), contemporary fantasy, comedy (facial distortion, funny expressions), magic (circles, spellcasting, magic weapons), mahou shoujo, school life, seinen, superpower (emotions awaken superpowers) with some loli, yuri, and harem elements<br />
<br />
<br />
✔Positive Aspects✔<br />
<br />
◧ Animation: adequately distinct characters, based on colors of moderate to low saturation/medium to high lumination, with the urban environment and the urban landscapes being a little more muted in comparison. The fact that the studio is improving its animation quality is evident from its crisper action scenes (see below).<br />
<br />
◧ Comedic sequences: following

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339998">
        the 1st and the 2nd seasons, this is the most enjoyable of this series. This time, they consistently revolve around a broader cast of characters that includes the protagonists, their families, and the group of their closest classmates. Also, they are taking place on even more physical locations, ranging from each other&#039;s homes to the beach, to theme parks, and to festivals.<br />
<br />
◧ Fan service: from the Illya special episodes (1st season) and onwards, the studio has been making a consistently solid effort to provide quality fan service, usually containing a lot of loli yuri and ecchi-based interactions (e.g. lingerie, sexually suggestive clothing, skirt flipping, pantsu, breast fondling).<br />
<br />
✘Negative Aspects✘<br />
<br />
◧ Action scenes: from the Sekka no Chikai movie onwards, Silver Link has been consistently putting out more polished and stylish action sequences, clearly chasing after Ufotable&#039;s remarkable work in UBW &amp; F/Z. Specifically, it does a good job using various camera perspectives (first-person, second-person, third-person) coupled with different camera &#039;heights&#039; and quick zoom-ins/outs. Unfortunately, even though the end result is visually similar, it nevertheless gives off a sloppy, shounen-ish vibe. Also, they are strikingly few in number - 2 major fights spread out over 3,5 episodes.<br />
<br />
◧ Plot: this season suffers from the exact same issue that previous season does, that there&#039;s not much of a plot to speak of. Particularly, there are only hints throughout the first 5 episodes, with the 6th episode functioning as an &quot;informational filler&quot;. The narrative unfolds during the last 4 episodes, virtually in the midst of consecutive fighting. Absolutely terrible decision.<br />
<br />
◧ Soundtrack: from silly-sounding tracks to electronic music during the comedic sequences, new age piano/new age orchestral tracks during the more dramatic scenes, and, mostly, electronic music during the action scenes. Nothing really popped, most felt very generic and low-key for my taste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: Even though the series consistently provides hilarious comedic sequences and generous fan service, it has a tremendously hard time combining the dramatic, comedic, and action elements into a balanced whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. For further reviews of the Fate franchise, please take a look at my profile.

    This season has a different approach to plot and pace compared to the previous ones. The story itself only appears on the 6th episode and from there everything happens at once. I didn&#039;t enjoy this sequel as much as I did the other past seasons because of this. It was really hard for me to care about what was happening and become emotionally invested it the story. <br />
<br />
The animation also got slightly downgraded which caught me off guard. The sound quality is still great, though. <br />
<br />
If yuri and yaoi content bothers you, don&#039;t watch this. Having said that, there is an episode that (SPOILERS) shows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339622">
        that homophobia makes no sense and needs to be eradicated and gets this point across by having the MAIN CHARACTER LEARN THAT LESSON. It was the first time I&#039;ve ever seen that happen and I&#039;m happy that this was done. HOWEVER, the same episode ends by having the same characters literally running away from a character that states that she believes in same-sex couples. It&#039;s not funny, it contradicts what happened 3 seconds ago and it just made the show look horribly stupid. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, this season gets a 6/10 from me.

    I have to say, with absolute subjectivity, that this is probably the best season by far... and it&#039;s all because that it basically ignores the actual storyline for the first 6 episodes. And if this was any other anime, I&#039;d definitely rate this much lower as it&#039;s basically filler, however because it&#039;s Fate/Kaleid, you all know why you&#039;re here. So let&#039;s continue and see why this is probably the best season.<br />
<br />
Since our lovable main cast has all been introduced and their characters outlined, this season expands their characters and gives you lots of fan service in between, making it one of the most enjoyable out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204359">
        of all three seasons. We get to see more of Kuro&#039;s mature, seductive and cheeky side, while Miyu opens up and has cuter interactions with Illya, with Illya staying relatively the same but it&#039;s the antics that she&#039;s thrust into and her reactions to them that seals the deal. <br />
<br />
So overall, if you didn&#039;t like the series in the first place, you really shouldn&#039;t be watching this (let alone season 2). But if you loved Fate/Kaleid for what it is, definitely watch this, you will not be disappointed... well maybe when the story actually gets back on track, lol.

    I can&#039;t believe this show is my favourite anime of the past few years, this season of the anime is my favourite. If you haven&#039;t saw the earlier seasons then why are you reading this review? Anyway this anime is an adaptation of the second half of the 2wei manga. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story 8/10 <br />
<br />
This season is pretty much the slice of life season, the first half made up of episodes such as trips to the beach, festivals and amusement parks. Each character has their own comedic &#039;role&#039; to play, whether it&#039;s Miyu&#039;s deadpan humour, Illya&#039;s WTF reactions, or even Tatsuko&#039;s hyper-energy style of living. There&#039;s plenty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266028">
        of different personalities, mostly relevant to otaku cliches, with an extra special surprise building on one of the side-characters &#039;confusion&#039; outlined in earlier series (which I found particularly crazy). <br />
<br />
All of these different styles of character add up, and allow for a diverse range of awkward, almost shamelessly otaku-pandering style of humour to sate any thirsts you may have for this kind of comedy. I really can appreciate the ridiculousness of it, and it&#039;s nice that they bring side-characters such as Bazett into a more &#039;normal&#039; manner, away from the chaos of fighting. It&#039;s more similar to the ova extras (without as much of an yuri vibe, which while it can get comedic I&#039;m glad they don&#039;t push it since its a bit cringey, which in itself is kind of funny).<br />
 <br />
The plot of Herz! only actually picks up towards the end of the season, with a few references made in what little build up there is. But, if you could call the 2wei anime the &#039;Kuro&#039; arc, then this one surely should be the &#039;Miyu&#039; arc as it builds on her backstory and character development more than any other (this continues into the next season too), while making good preparations for the next season. I can appreciate the serious stuff, but they don&#039;t overdo it  and the theme of friendship still rules supreme.<br />
<br />
Art 9<br />
<br />
I suppose I really like the art too, they get the expressions pretty great on reaction, and it&#039;s definitely fitting for the anime. It&#039;s not overbearing like some other shows can be.<br />
<br />
Sound 9<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just rating this for Prisma Illya overall, but since I regularly listen to the ost of all the Fate series, and I like the magical girl adventure vibe of this sound track (and Unlimited Blade Works themes) I believe it gets a 9. <br />
<br />
Character 9 <br />
<br />
I basically already covered this in the story paragraphs, but for the slice-of-life episodes, the rest of the &#039;normal schoolgirl&#039; cast act less as background characters, and are focused on way more, making them somewhere above the typical side character but obviously not quite as prominent as the main cast. I really enjoyed the focus on their interactions together, and even interactions with even less prominent side characters such as Issei, Shirou and Suzuka&#039;s sister add a lot to this season. The more normalised aspect of the characters is a welcome change. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall 8<br />
<br />
While my review might seem overwhelmingly positive for me to only give it an 8 overall, unfortunately I tend to not be deeply absorbed into anime, tv and whatever else in my current state of life. This is why the show was a HUGE surprise to me, and one genre I definitely would have avoided if it wasn&#039;t tied into Fate. That said, I&#039;ve not actually tried any similar shows, excluding the more serious (which for someone who struggles to become engaged in a story gets boring) magical girl shows like Madoka, which I kinda found boring. <br />
<br />
I think season two onwards of Prisma Iilya really ups the quality dramatically compared to season 1 (which on its own was an average-okay series). I&#039;ve not really felt anything has been worthy of an 8 for years in terms of enjoyment, for me, the dumb, simple humour built on character progression rather than gags somehow done the trick. As if to cement my failure as an adult male, it&#039;s a real guilty pleasure* I never expected to enjoy so much.<br />
<br />
*I feel the somewhat unnecessary yuri (not prominent in this season) adds to the awkwardness and humour, but it also causes the show to become stereotyped so I&#039;m thankful they&#039;ve seemed to have toned it down a bit. I&#039;m not sure if I really got the point across, but if you enjoy awkward humour, based sometimes on deadpan, misunderstanding and obsession, then maybe you should watch the series. I hope they have another slice of life arc one day. <br />
<br />

    while watching Fate/Stay Night or Fate/Zero, have you ever thought &quot;you know what this anime needs? OP FRIENDSHIP POWERS that conveniently solves everything!&quot; of course you didn&#039;t. but this anime is basically that, well that and writers putting little girls in sexually suggestive lesbian situations. so on short, expect 3 seasons worth of loli lesbian ecchi fanservice and some fight scenes where FRIENDSHIP POWER always wins, the 4th season is a little different though, a little more serious,  a tiny glimpse of the source material this spin-off was from. not saying this anime is bad, well if it was bad i would&#039;ve rated it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271215">
        below 5, it serves it&#039;s purpose well, i think it delivers what it&#039;s target audience wants, namely magical girls, ecchi, yuri, lolis and friendship trumps all stories, it just so happens that some of those things just don&#039;t align with my interest which is why i didn&#039;t find enjoyment in this spin-off as much as other people have. &quot;why did you watch this knowing it&#039;s like that&quot; you may ask, well it&#039;s Fate, simple as that, i love the Fate series, well the main series at least which is why i want to watch all things Fate even if they don&#039;t have the elements i&#039;m primarily interested in.
