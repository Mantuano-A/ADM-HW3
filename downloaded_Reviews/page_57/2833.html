    It&#039;s been a long six months, and I must say that this anime was one of the shows I most looked forward to every week through spring and summer.  I have a lot of good things to say about this anime so lets get started!<br />
<br />
STORY 7/10- The best way to define the story is &quot;not bad&quot;.  It&#039;s a fairly interesting story about friendship and vengeance, and had it&#039;s fair share of comedy and touchy moments which are the kind of things I personally like in an anime.  Even though I watched the show from the first day of broadcast (which I mentioned

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19036">
        before was roughly six months ago) it didn&#039;t seem like that long ago that I started.  I believe the sole reason to be the fact that 95% of the story took place in one geographical area.  I wouldn&#039;t say this is good or bad, but definitely interesting.<br />

ART 10/10- Amazing.  State of the art animation, taken to it&#039;s full potential.  The most notable example would be right when the opening credits start after the preview where there&#039;s a beautiful aerial shot of the church with a glaring sun in the background.  Absolutely breathtaking.<br />
<br />
SOUND 11/10- That&#039;s right... 11 (for the sake of the review since I can&#039;t actually select the number 11 for this category)  I speak mostly for the music.  Great songs for the OP/ED credits.  What gives this category an 11 is the amazing orchestral background music throughout the anime and the beautiful insert in the end.  The sound fx were great, very fitting with all the magic and the like going on.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 8/10- The characters were very like-able, though we never really find out too much about them save for the main character and one other character.  Personally I thought they were all &quot;cool&quot;, even the bad guy was pretty &quot;cool&quot; and their powers were &quot;cool&quot;.  One interesting thing to note was that there weren&#039;t any important female characters.  Just a cute trio of nuns we see from time to time and a mermaid.  As a guy I do enjoy having cute and attractive girl characters play a role in the main plot, but I will give this anime a plus for being enjoyable without me even actually noticing the lack of a strong female character.  (I noticed only after finishing the anime, in which I read a few explicit comments from the other reviews)<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 9/10- I truly truly enjoyed this anime.  Very pleasing to the eyes and ears, touchy moments and a &quot;not bad&quot; story.  As I said before I looked forward to it every week and I also look forward to a second season.<br />
<br />
Overall I give it a 9, deducting 1 point for the lack of that masterpiece story-line.  For those who haven&#039;t watched it and those who may have only watched 1 or 2 episodes, I will admit that it takes a little while to &quot;get good&quot;.  Hang in there and you won&#039;t regret it : )

    Story: 5<br />
<br />
Church Daily Life really says it all. I’ve watched 9 episodes of this show and for all but about half of the first one Teito has been moping around in a church. There is a pretty obvious looking back-story lurking in the background but progress is extremely slow and the vast majority of time is spent on the aforementioned moping around part. The story also suffers a lot from the ineffective relationship between Teito and Mikage. Clearly 07-Ghost meant Mikage to be a great influence on Teito and shape him in to the force he will likely eventually be in the story, but ineffective

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15540">
        scenes and lack of on screen development of their relationship make conversations between the two feel fake and forced. It doesn’t help that much of the dialog is just plain bad either.<br />
<br />
The other major problem with the story a clear lack of a major enemy (more in characters section). Neither Ayanami nor the Kors are developed enough to really bring out any feelings of anger against them and they’re the most developed of any enemy in the series. One could argue the enemy is “The Military” but that angle just isn’t developed at all.<br />
<br />
So we end up with Teito saying he has a purpose but not acting like he does (talk is cheap) and there being no pushing force to nudge him onward.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
The art in general is pretty good, but sadly there are specific problems that bring it down quite a bit. For starters the fight scenes are extremely bad to such a degree that even few of the most ardent fans think they’re any good. It is hard to really explain without seeing it, but battles basically consist of people fighting with strings of letters. Rarely are the battle scenes at all impressive and generally they’re just dull.<br />
<br />
Enemies look unremarkable. Kors are a good example of this as they are seemingly one of the main evil enemies in the series and yet they look bland. The characters also look extremely similar in structure, although I suppose this can be somewhat common in many animes. The fight scene issue combines with the enemies/characters issue to make things even worse. You end up having a bunch of bland characters jumping around shooting steams of letters at each other.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
<br />
Sound is pretty good, but not great. Voice actors all do their job well enough (although I wouldn’t say any are epic in how they bring their character to life). Music is pretty decent if you like that type, but not remarkable.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
<br />
For light to exist there must be the dark. What is this strange phrase you ask? Well, it is the reason I think the characters in Ghost suffer so badly. There is no real enemy or anything to compel our main character to wage war against them so in turn, our main character has nothing to do. Well, technically, Ayanami is our arch enemy and Kors are our evil soul corrupters, but sadly they’re developed so poorly that they might as well not even exist and just throw random enemies at our good guys instead.<br />
<br />
Ayanami is the most generic anime bad guy ever. He has white hair, he is young and his screen time is entirely consumed of scenes of him brooding and laughing evilly in the shadows. Never once (in the episodes I’ve watched) does he do something to make you hate him or cheer for Teito. He almost comes close once, but then the anime merely hints at hinting at what he did so there is no real effect.<br />
<br />
Kors are simply not developed at all. Ok so they’re basically demons/evil spirits possessing people in all but name, but their appearance is not impressive at all (dear god, that normal looking person now has some flimsy looking bone wings now, the horror!) and generally they’re dealt with easily with no friendly losses (mostly). The other major problem with Kors is that of the characters I’ve seen possessed by Kors, none of them have been developed enough to make the viewer feel sorry for them or terrified of the Kors. This is in sharp contrast to a show like Pandora Hearts which has sort of a similar aspect with illegal contractors losing their souls in effective scenes and most importantly after they’ve been developed a little so that you care about them a bit.<br />
<br />
Teito and Mikage mainly suffer from their relationship not being developed nearly well enough. A lot of the story seems to stem from these two and how much they care about each other and yet this anime has decided to demonstrate that they were close not by showing effective scenes of the reasons they became friends and of them getting through various trials as friends, but by telling us that they’re friends (I.E. Teito:”Mikage is by best friend” Mikage:”Teito is my best friend”). Individually neither one is really a strong character though. Teito keeps on moping around and getting emo over Mikage and his situation, and yet he does nothing and spends his time frolicking around the church eating edible sweet flowers. Even after said situation is taken care of more or less, Teito never leaves his moping/emo/frolicking mode. Mikage is just not developed at all. We don’t really know anything about him other than Teito is the center of his world and he values his family a bit. In fact his sole reason for existing seems to be to move Teito along in the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
<br />
I can’t say I really enjoyed this series. While I like action, battles are generally low on my scale for grading an anime, but 07-Ghost is one of those shows where even I think it suffers from the horrible battles. Dialog annoys me GREATLY because it is so bad at times and it is never good for the most part. Overall story progression is about as fast as watching paint dry when it is raining outside which also annoys me greatly because the thing that almost always affects my enjoyment of nearly any form of entertainment the most is the overall story. Teito also annoyed me to no end since he would constantly be complaining about wanting to do something and yet never do it. I also hated how Teito was supposed to be so powerful and yet every time it comes time to show off his power, it ends up just looking flashy but doing nothing, and then someone needs to rescue him. Most people don’t want to see a useless main character and I am no exception.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
Serious problems cripple what could have been a really good show. It is a shame really because I liked the first episode, but after that it just gets worse and stays worse. The writers of the 07-Ghost seem to have ignored every other anime (or just form of entertainment) and have made mistakes that other authors have fixed years ago. It also isn’t like 07-Ghost has a lot of unique scenes either (I’m not slamming them for this as they aren’t unique because people generally enjoy these plot elements) as many plot elements are common ones that are done way better in a lot of other anime (not to mention books or movies).

    Art: The art was very good for the characters. The bad part is that the explosions, the attacks and the Zaiphons were a bit overdone and looks really out of placed, like a live action movie using computer graphics. It would of been better if it was more natural. There was also very little amounts of blood, and they censored most of the killings. The Kor&#039;s are also very computer graphic like. It&#039;s like those discovery channel where they try to recreate a dinosaur, that kind of look.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound was probably what I liked the most. It had a good opening and ending theme

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19409">
        song, especially how they executed it. However, some of the voicing was bad, like the girl who was possessed by a Kor. Also, when a sword or sythe slashes someone, they block the sound of the slash or something. It reminds me of Hitman Reborn of them punching someone without the punching noises.<br />
<br />
Character: The characters were mostly good. I love the art for most of them. I must say the three bishops, Castor, Labrador and Frau were the best and most interesting characters. They were well drawn, and kept a cool character image. Teito was an average character. He didn&#039;t really pique my interest in as a character. Just a below average main character, like Sawada from Hitman Reborn (This series reminds me a lot of Hitman Reborn). Although I must admit he does grow as a character, but it took him a long time that it makes me angry sometimes. This whole story is basically based on his growth, and it was really just him basically getting rid of his hatred and turning it into the will to protect. They made the antagonists look really badass too, which is a good redeemable feature.<br />
<br />
Story: The story, was awfully slow. They kept repeating the same concept over and the episode would only move forward by an inch. There was no climax to anything. Teito is just so indecisive that it makes the story not go forward. I mean they spent like an episode of him trying to figure out if he should trust the church or not.  He should read Bloody Monday and that&#039;ll show him that he&#039;s got it nice with the trusting. Then there is all these flashbacks. Some were really repetitive and really out of placed. Not to mention the locked memories part. Then there is the whole point of throwing out a lot of questions out, and receiving very little to no answers at all. I can kind of piece things together, but nothing is ever made explicit. This whole story seems to be only focused on Teito&#039;s development, and it wasn&#039;t very interesting to see. He keeps asking stupid questions like, &quot;do you remember the 7 light&quot; to Hakuren. OF COURSE HE DOES, he&#039;s a priest, trying to be a bishop. Instead of wasting your time asking stupid stuff, why not you just go and move on. Also, most of his actions are contradictory. One second he wants to seek revenge, the other he tells he shouldn&#039;t because Mikage told him not to. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment Factor: Enjoyment was pretty nice, but also made me frustrated with Teito. It was a good series, actually, it had the potential to be. Maybe showing more of the 7 ghosts would be good. I gave it such a low rank because there was just so many fails in this series that I can&#039;t give it a good score. I came in with high hopes, and came out with a disappointment. What really pisses me off is the action scenes. They were horrible. This series is more of a story type, but that fails, so while looking for something to make up for it, I looked at their actions. I looked at the wrong place because they were horrid. They were as bad as the play the three nuns did during the bazaar. Although I must admit, I like the way they ended the series. Left out a big open to season 2. Hopefully they&#039;ll do much better. <br />
<br />
Note: This was a shoujo series, so I guess I shouldn&#039;t expect much about the action, although they should of done a much better job in the plot.

    One of my all time favourites, I figured I should give it a proper review. <br />
<br />
Story (7/10) - The plot is alright, in my opinion. It is a bit slow (there are quite a few episodes with Teito moping around feeling sorry for himself) but it is sound. It has it&#039;s funny moments, and the scenes just make you want to go &quot;awww&quot;. There&#039;s also a few sad moments which I know I went through a few tissue boxes whilst watching.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not many confrontations between the &#039;good&#039; side and the &#039;bad&#039; side. Ayanami prefers to send his lowly minions after Teito rather then go after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30317">
        him himself. The few times they do confront, well you&#039;ll see for youself why I was disappointed with it.<br />
<br />
The ending of the anime is very open-ended, there are still a lot of loose ties that have yet to be resolved, yet I&#039;m oddly satisfied with it. We get to see a montage of the previous episodes and it serves as a reminder of how much Teito has grown and mature during the course of the anime. It is hard to put into words, but I was happy with the ending. That said, I wouldn&#039;t mind a second season.<br />
 <br />
Art (10/10) - The art has got to be the best things about this anime. It is one of the reasons I&#039;ll watch the anime over and over again. The characters are absolutely gorgeous and well drawn, as are their &#039;chibi&#039; forms (I think that&#039;s what they&#039;re called? But it&#039;s when the characters are doing something funny, the art style changes a little?)<br />
<br />
The setting, don&#039;t get me started. The setting is amazing, you don&#039;t see many religious settings in anime, but this one is centred around a church and is beautifully depicted. You won&#039;t be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10) - The soundtrack is a delight to listen to. I especially like the starting theme (Aka no Kakera by Yuki Suzuki) and the ending theme (Hitomi no Kotae by Noria) and the instrumental pieces are pretty good as well, it goes hand in hand with the anime. There&#039;s also a scene where Teito sings the Raggs Requiem (Rags no Chinkonka, also by Noria) which I loved.<br />
<br />
Character (7/10) – I love the character development for Teito! It is particulary interesting watching Teito transist from a military soldier to a bishop in training. There is a bit of BL, meaning brotherly love, not boy&#039;s love! lol. Though if you do like shounen-ai, there are some undertones of it, the cast is predominantly male after all! Seriously, there is only a minor few female roles (the sisters and Raziel (sp?)) and they don&#039;t really do much.<br />
<br />
The cast of characters is quite interesting though, ranging from the badass perverted bishop (Frau) and other equally strange bishops, to the cheerful best friend who would do anything for the main character (Mikage), to hot-in-uniform bad guys *drool*. I personally would have loved them all the more if there was more background story to some of the more major characters though, especially the Ghosts. I was really interested in them and was disappointed when not much was revealed by the end of the anime :( It’s one of the reasons why this section lost points. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10) – I really loved this anime, and I’ve re-watched it quite a few times without losing interest. Although the plot is quite serious, there are quite a few funny moments which were further enhanced by the chibi-fying of the characters and is quite entertaining XD If there was an emotional equivalent of a colour palette, then 07 Ghost would envoke the whole spectrum. Laugh, cry, anger, despair, hate, joy, love, acceptence. It really is an emotional rollercoaster which I love in an anime.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
<br />
I know 07 Ghost may not be for everyone, it is more of a shoujo-orientated anime after all and with a slow-moving plot that may be tedious for some. It is worth giving a try though, who knows? Maybe you will enjoy it. I managed to convince a few hesitent friends to watch it, and they really liked it in the end :) If you do finish watching the anime, then I very much recommend you go read the manga as well.<br />
<br />
Recommended Watching: Pandora Hearts, Kuroshitsuji<br />
<br />
Well… yeah. Enjoy if you do try it out, and let’s hope for a second season soon.<br />

    It was the spring of 2009, and as I browsed  through the upcoming anime, I stumbled across a show entitled &quot;07-Ghost&quot; which I thought had great promise, how wrong was I. In my opinion, 07-Ghost is important for being the one who gave a start to other anime of this kind. You may ask, what kind? First of all, the story is set in an &quot;all boys church&quot; sends shounen-ai alerts from a mile away. However ,the staff being too afraid that straight male audience won&#039;t find it &quot;appealing&quot; covered the story with a pathetic &quot;it is but a wonderful friendship between boys&quot;. Second

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89477">
        of all, the way the story progresses, or rather regresses is stupefying.<br />
<br />
The only episode that I really enjoyed watching was the first one, after that, it went down hill. From being a student in a military academy to becoming a &quot;church boy magic user&quot; already says enough about the &quot;development&quot; of the characters. I must say, the show really had promise, even if the art itself gave &quot;shonen-ai alerts&quot; I didn&#039;t mind, thinking that the story will progress from there, sadly it didn&#039;t.<br />
Story: 3<br />
<br />
The art is too eye-candy, making the mostly bishonen boys characters stand out too much. However, for older characters or &quot;unappealing&quot; ones the show does them a disservice, since the art is suited only for the &quot;young beautiful boys&quot;. The action scenes are dull, slow and uninteresting. I saw shows where the female character could have beaten them without breaking a sweat.<br />
Being a supernatural themed anime, I expected more from the visual effects, which left me totally unimpressed.<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
The only redeeming factor is the quality of the music, which is the only thing the staff actually put some effort into.<br />
Sound: 7<br />
<br />
The main characters are the usual stereotype of an uke and seme, from physical appearance to personality and so on. Teito Klein is the usual &quot;prettier than a girl uke&quot;, who many can easily imagine him dressed up as a girl. He doesn&#039;t have much of a character development, other than being forced by certain situations to &quot;man up&quot; a little, like the loss of his friend and coming to a different place. The Frau character is the cliche of a &quot;badass&quot;, &quot;cool&quot; seme with a past. The lack of originality in the creation of the characters and the lack of commitment of the staff could have annoyed the hell out of me, if I weren&#039;t too busy to yawn.<br />
<br />
Another minus is the lack of female characters all together, which often happens in shonen-ai and yaoi, since that way the straight male won&#039;t be tempted by &quot;the seduction&quot; of the opposite sex, his attention focusing only on the gourgeous looking boys. And what would be the perfect setting for gathering males without female intervention ? You guessed right, a &quot;church&quot; !<br />
It is really awful how the creators used all type of clichees and mashed them up together to result in something of low quality, but enough to appeal to the gullible audience, the lack of respect for the viewers is revolting.<br />
Characters: 3<br />
<br />
My enjoyment lasted only as the first episode, the rest was a bloody, unfocused mess. I recommend it only if you enjoy bishonen staring at each other, if you are a yaoi admirer, this is not the anime for you, it only degrades what a yaoi really is.<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
<br />
Overall: 4

    There are several other reviews for this anime, so I&#039;ll just get to the point. It is a pile of mediocrity in almost every way - lame characters that have been done and done better before, a story that is a mish-mash of other anime, average art and goofy looking costumes.  The story can at times be interesting (the description on MAL doesn&#039;t do it justice), but in the end the producers settled for something that was mass-marketable instead of creating something genuinely good. That&#039;s not to say it&#039;s a bad anime, just that it&#039;s nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to include

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22688">
        any spoilers, but it may be worthwhile to note the MAL description makes it seem as if the story is largely concerned with the military academy and Teito&#039;s time there. That isn&#039;t really accurate as his time spent there is a minor part of the story, but the military does play and important part in the rest of the story&#039;s development. Teito being able to change the fate of the world is much more complicated then the description hints at, but again I don&#039;t want to include an spoilers.<br />
<br />
Its biggest problem may be the lame and boring main characters. I feel a good set of characters can make up for a lot of other short comings since they are, along with plot, the main part of the story. 07-Ghost fails to create interesting or even likable characters. I assume the almost exclusively male character line up is meant to entice female viewers e.g. they are supposed to be bishounens, but their generic designs, reused personalities and goofy outfits would interest only the most immature or crazed fangirl. I should explain about the outfits, but I&#039;d really rather not relive it - it may suffice to say them seemed to be channeling Trinity Blood in the worst way possible. An anime is not doing its job if the main character could die and the audience could car less. Its main redeeming point is the character Ayanami who is a crazy f***. He adds a much needed layer of interesting to the otherwise bland show (I&#039;m not saying that in a fangirl way). When you have no emotional investment in the characters because the production has completely failed to make them interesting or likable it can be kinda of fun to watch them get messed with which is Ayanami adds to the show. He is the main reason I both stuck with this anime and why I didn&#039;t give it a lower score - by the end I was really hoping he would be victorious over Teito.<br />
<br />
The ending is unsatisfying in that there is not an actual conclusion. I&#039;m sure the manga covers more, but it is very obvious that the producers left it open for a second season by not actually finishing the first. Overall the show wasn&#039;t bad, just so very average.

    Its been a hard few days watching this anime 4 to 6 hours straight, well at least I think that&#039;s how long it was. But now I have finally finished and in this review I will be giving you my impressions of it but it was enjoyable to say the least. I was happy watching it although after you read this you probably thinking if this sentence is even part of this anime or even for this anime review. Anyways, enough about that let&#039;s get straight to the point. Onward to the review.<br />
<br />
Story (7/10) - How would I sum up this whole anime in one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98087">
        word, I think &#039;fair&#039;, is a justifiable means for it. The story was very enjoyable and fun to watch, don&#039;t get me wrong, but if you were to put it altogether as a whole, then I&#039;m afraid it just doesn&#039;t work out so well. The anime felt like it was never moving on or how else should I put it, hmmm, just felt like never lifted off in any particular direction. I mean the main character was stuck worrying over something that happened at the beginning of the anime for some periods of time. The story felt like it was never progressing, and when finally the story started moving forward (moving towards the light) we are suddenly dragged down (dragged down into darkness) to where we started in the first place. Finally when the story then starts making progression, you then start to really get the feel for it and start to enjoy it, I mean talk about taking your time. There are also parts where you thought you was going to get a nice scene or some awesome fighting action but even then, they were mediocre at best, so if you are a person that is an action fanatic then I would tell you to look away from this now, because you will find yourself quite disappointed and left totally unsatisfied. <br />
<br />
Now it does look like I&#039;m just speaking ill of this anime but inspite of all of that, this story will make you want to watch each episode just to see what &#039;will&#039; happen and how it will turn out. The characters mainly the main ones, have some really good back stories to them which are nice to just sit back and watch for you to enjoy as you learn more about them, it gives you a nice sense of depth to them which leads to you liking certain characters for those exact reasons. That&#039;s all I would like to say as anymore could ruin the experience, but I will say this much, is that, near the end even though it was a fitting one, felt like it was a cliff hanger and felt like it had so much more to offer and to explore but you will know when you watch it.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10) - The art is just stunning and beautiful, it is one of the best straits of this anime. Purely stunning, but I can&#039;t say much seems I &#039;was&#039; watching the Online Version of this anime but still was good. The characters art were nicely drawn. Clothes seemed to sort them and even added a sense of character to them and they were appealing. Scenery that you&#039;ll see is mind blowing at times. Like the scene where the light appears, which looked warm and inviting and draws you more into the story or the aspect of it anyways. Although I never knew why blood had this glow to it, but might of just been me.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10) - Now of course sound/music all comes down to personal taste so this will be my personal view on it and opinion, and in my opinion the opening theme took a couple of episodes to get used to, but after that it didn&#039;t feel like I had to wait for the video to load just so I can skip it and get to the start of the story. It ended up being a nice song to listen to and at times made me want to sing it out loud to myself. It was a nice up beat song. Now the ending theme is where it gets the perfect 10 for me it was simply amazing. It suited the anime and was just a delight to listen to. Its beat, its rhythm and its lyrics were all nice to listen to and sing. Right at the beginning of it was the best part for me though, which was:<br />
<br />
Tooi natsukashiki keshiki yasashii yuki no kaori <br />
togiretogire no kioku o tsumuide michi o sagasu<br />
<br />
Which Translates<br />
<br />
The distant and nostalgic scenery, that sweet fragrance of snow,<br />
they tie down my broken memories and search for the road I must take.<br />
<br />
Characters (6/10) - This element of the anime is what really brings it down and if it was done a little better, then it could have easily of had gotten an 8 from me in the overall but I just couldn&#039;t bring myself to do it. The Main Character was just terrible he just moaned and always was frightened and getting annoyed over everything. It maybe because I haven&#039;t lived a life like his and maybe that&#039;s why I don&#039;t understand why he was so pathetic at times. I mean it took him forever to finally feel strong enough about his resolve to be able to finally move on in his life, which because of that eventually compelled the story to move forward as well. But his back story gave him a deep sense of depth to his character which was nice I suppose. But the fact that he was even telling himself, why he keeps thinking and bringing himself down over the same thing after finally thinking he could move forward. Just come up with a strong resolve and be done with it don&#039;t spend 5,10 episodes thinking of it and being a weakling. But the worst thing is that after finally doing that goes right back at it again. Just a weak character in sense of his mind, his resolves and no sense on how to move on, I won&#039;t say body because you know why when you watch it because I don&#039;t want to give any spoilers but no it&#039;s not because it&#039;s a fit looking character for you girls to enjoy having a look at, it&#039;s because I mean come on, I&#039;m a boy.<br />
 The other characters though are good and with some of the back stories adds a lot of depth and can really end up being one of your favorite characters. To be honest though it felt like the supporting characters were more memorable than the main ones apart from Frau because it was a bad ass and just an awesome character in general unlike our main character. Although saying all this, in each any every character felt like there was a hole missing from them, like the characters were never complete probably mainly due to the fact not everything was explained to the full in my opinion but that&#039;s just me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10) - You will really end up enjoying this anime a lot despite all the criticism I have been given it. It still will make you want to watch each episode just so you know what will happen in each one till the end. For this reason I thought it was really hard to mark some areas correctly or to make them seem justifiable to the way I have been describing them but I honestly feel you will enjoy this anime a whole depending on viewer of course.<br />
<br />
Overall (7/10) - Now seems you probably know what I will say in my overall and what I think about it so I&#039;m just going to say to which audience this anime would appeal to. Now, this anime doesn&#039;t fixate on one genre, for example it doesn&#039;t have much action nor military aspect, it&#039;s basically like what I said before, if you are really truly into or fixated in any one of the particular genres that this anime has, then I would tell you to turn away now, because you will be quite disappointed. I think its more for people who I more on the open side willing to expand and not be fixated on genre, otherwise it will totally ruin the experience of this anime if you do. <br />
<br />
Well that&#039;s all I got to say about this anime in this review. Now I did just do one about this two seconds ago typing it all out finally getting it perfect and then my computer shut down on me to restart for the updates it totally made me mad. Didn&#039;t manage to save any of my progress or manage to publish it either, worse thing is I couldn&#039;t remember it word by word although remember few things here and there and tried to replicate it so if some areas are off, I&#039;m sorry. Was just so p*ssed when that happened but more sad than anything spending few hours typing it out after just watching it, so it was my feelings were into it as well and the experience. So this one I think is inferior but will have to do, anyways I hope you enjoy the review nonetheless and see you in the next review I do.

     ok yes there are some awkward moments in the show but Death Note has some pretty gay undertones sometimes too lol. the show is great, i just finished watching ep. 04 and i have to say that the creative religion-based storyline behind it is pretty cool...and the weapons are awesome! scythes coming out of people arms and demons with skeleton wings...i dont think i need to say more. i&#039;m an 18 year old guy and so far i love this show. the story is about two best friends.... not two lovers, if your having second thoughts just give it a shot. the art is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14620">
        awesome and the action is even better. all i have to say is if your comfortable with your sexuality then there shouldn&#039;t be a problem, this is an overall awesome anime!

    Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. That&#039;s the most prominent word in my mind when I begin to describe this masterpiece.<br />
 <br />
Story: Every story could easily be better. The plot was straightforward, but if they elaborated more on the ending it could have been so much better. 9<br />
<br />
Art: Truly, the animation was outstanding! Sure, the explosions and Kor may have been a bit overdone, but even so that does not take away any from the beauty. 10<br />
<br />
Sound: The opening theme was brilliant. One of the few opening themes I actually enjoyed, and it never bored me to listen to it. I really loved how the ending song was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27485">
        blended into the end of the episode. No matter what the situation was, that music just seemed to fit. Then the music within the episodes set the perfect mood. 10<br />
<br />
Character: It was easy to get attached to these characters. So easy, in fact, that I found myself crying a lot. They probably could have shown more about some of the other characters, but that very well could have been overkill. The characters they elaborated on were just right so there really wasn&#039;t much more that was needed.  10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: After all this praise, it&#039;d be hard to imagine saying anything bad about the show. Which is why it should be obvious that I enjoyed watching this anime completely. 10<br />
<br />
Overall: This should be obvious as well. 10<br />
Like I said, it was just beautiful.

    To start with I would like to say that I will not compare this anime to its original manga. For two reasons first I have not read it and also because I believe that an anime needs to have a certain likability to both the non-reader and the reader alike. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are your three wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Story: Although I must say, this story was quite different then what I expected going in. If you asked me about Ghost before I watched it I would have asked if you meant that Priest one. So going in I had almost no preconceived notions of what it was about. So

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21981">
        I was surprised that the opening episodes were so engaging. They were all different from each other making them enjoyable. But as it the story carried on I learned that it was a little bit like driving a car. The story would go really fast and then slow down, sometimes almost drag every two episodes. The drag time was considerably longer then the excitement. There was even a batch of episodes in the middle that were the same. I don&#039;t know if one would not put this together if they were watching it as it was airing, but it was something I noticed watching a few each night. <br />
<br />
On top of that, it was also one for ridiculous story telling elements that made you scratch your head. All in all I give the story a 5.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I will admit that I like this style of art. If find it attractive to look at. Besides the characters the backgrounds and worlds were well constructed. The animation did not start off really well. It was like watching one of those American shows where there is a sweep episode near the end that needs to be stronger. After episode 20 or so I thought the animation quality was higher. I would also like to add that the outfits were amazing. <br />
I give the art an 8.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The opening was very good. I really enjoyed the song, although it suffered from what I like to call long opening syndrome. That is pretty self explanatory  but it is where, the opening is too long. So it was a little hard to watch it over and over after 15 or so times. The ending was also enjoyable. The sounds during battle were excellent, otherwise the music faded into the background a little.<br />
I give the sound a 7<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This was a little difficult. I thought that the main character and the cast of antagonists were horribly cliche. They could have fallen out of any anime and found themselves quite happy here. They were not vivid or original, they were pretty much cookie cutter characters. The same though goes for the priests, they were just simple personalities coughed up in the forum of priests. <br />
For characters: 6<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: All in all it was a pretty good anime, certainly not the best I have seen. The episodes that actually moved the story on were good. Otherwise some were rather tedious or had a filler feel to them. <br />
Enjoyment I give a 7.<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
It was interesting, it was different, and it was cliche. That is what killed it. It was a good concept that was just horribly placed out. It was almost like please give us a second season, we really want it. For all the ups and downs it was quite the trip.<br />
<br />
The short run:<br />
<br />
Pros- Goods backgrounds, great music, nice outfits, and towards the end well made battles.<br />
<br />
Cons- Cookie cutter characters, poor story direction, and too much drag time in plot.<br />
<br />
Overall I give it a 6.

    Even though this is a Shojo. Its a great anime for male or female. It&#039;s set in a &quot;Code Geass&quot; style world, the characters are very interesting, and the super powers makes it kinda cool too. The 2nd episode should come out wed. so we&#039;ll see how it moves from there. I heard the manga was very good as well. Check it out if your  a Code Geass, or Trinity Blood fan...

    07-Ghost. At first glance, it looks awesome! At least, that&#039;s what I thought. <br />
I saw the good-looking characters with weapons and full of epic-ness! So I thought, this looks like a great show! I should watch it!<br />
<br />
I have never been so wrong.<br />
<br />
First episode though, I gave the show a 9! It started great with some action and great plot! I was telling all of my friends about how awesome this show was! <br />
First episode passed, and I went to the second episode. It still had my interest hooked! In fact, the second episode was even better! <br />
3 to 4 to 5 to 6...<br />
Wait, what happened?

After the first 5 or so episodes, things started to get, should I say, boring? Or maybe I mean to say repetitive. <br />
<br />
After watching the show for a while, I realized that each episode had the same thing happening every single time. <br />
There didn&#039;t seem to be any plot progression whatsoever. And it continues like that until the very end. <br />
<br />
<br />
I did give &quot;Art&quot; a 9. My reason? because the art is great! The characters have beautiful details, which is what had me drawn to the show in the first place. The fighting, although short, repetitive and boring, are very beautifully done. The mix of bright, neon lights in the dark settings are exciting and detailed! <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 6.<br />
I&#039;ll take Sound to mean music and voice acting.<br />
Music was pretty good. But they did use the same songs very often, they were cool and interesting to listen to.<br />
Voice acting...well, some characters were really good while others made you cringe. (I watched this show in japanese as I do with every anime I watch. My opinions on the voices are of the japanese VAs)<br />
<br />
Teito Klein&#039;s voice wasn&#039;t the best choice. I am normally a huge fan of women doing young boy voices because generally they do well. But Saiga Mitsuki shouldn&#039;t be doing that. She has a lovely voice, but not for Teito.<br />
<br />
Frau&#039;s voice on the other hand was great! Suwabe Junichi is very talented and has the perfect rebellious and bad-ass voice that everyone loves to hear! It fits his character veery nicely.<br />
<br />
Ayanami. Well, his voice definitely fit him. His character may be what I had a problem with though. A boring villain who mostly sits in his chair and monotonously gives orders to his underlings rather than go fight the enemy himself.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Oak Hakuren. Fukuyama Jun is a famous, talented VA. But didn&#039;t work for Hakuren in my opinion. He seemed out of place and awkward at times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character is a 4. As mentioned earlier, the plot is terrible, and that mostly is becuase of the lack of character development! <br />
When watching something, I love to see how the character will progress overtime. As in, I can watch the first and last episode of the show and be amazed by the changes each character has made overtime!<br />
07-Ghost feels the same from beginning to end for the most part.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is a 5. Only good parts was the first 5-ish episodes, the art and Frau&#039;s character. If the art was bad and Frau didn&#039;t exist, I would have to give the enjoyment a 3 or lower. <br />
<br />
Overall is 5. <br />
I know that some people love this show and give it a anywhere between an 8 and a 10. But it all depends on the person watching it and what they like to see in a show. <br />
I always look for good, well written fights, some mystery, and possibly some unpredictable plot changes! 07-Ghost gave me none of those. I always knew what to expect because nothing was ever changing. <br />
I was bored while watching it and felt the need to take a break after each episode.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t recommend this show to many people because I personally didn&#039;t like it at all.

    I&#039;ll begin by saying that I&#039;ve seen 07-Ghost in two days. It&#039;s been on my to-watch list for long and finally had the time to watch it. <br />
<br />
Story 9/10:  I can understand why some people give it lower than my vote, it&#039;s quite slow-paced and the last fighting scene might be slightly disappointing because there was great anticipation to it. However since the manga is on-going, I expected this. And so I based my vote on the originality of the story (I never thought that I would like an anime based on church, god, and the likes). I firmly believe that to taste the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38332">
        whole story, one must either read the manga or hope for season 2.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10: Everything is so well done, I love how the characters where depicted and the scenes were very pretty. I love the characters clothes, especially the 3 bishops&#039; badass clothes.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10: The first thing I go to search after finishing an anime is the soundtrack. Right now I&#039;m listening to 07-Ghost soundtrack while writing this and what can I say, it&#039;s amazing. It fitted every scene perfectly. When I watch more than 1 episode per day, I usually skip the OP and ED after hearing them the first time, however I rarely skipped them in 07-Ghost.<br />
<br />
Character 9/10: I gave this a 9 for the same reason as the story. I am slightly disappointed that we didn&#039;t get to see all the 7 ghosts, however the story isn&#039;t finished so I suppose I&#039;ll encounter them in the manga. Teito&#039;s character development is quite great, he matured a lot and he&#039;s even able to smile at the end. I appreciated one scene in general, before the final fight, when Frau sent him to sleep and instead he stayed next to him. About the other characters, I love the 3 bishops&#039; characters, though I feel like there is more to them that needs to be shown. Same goes for the ~bad~ guys.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10: Seeing 25 episodes in 2 days is an obvious proof of how much I enjoyed it. Probably what I personally really liked and enjoyed was the slight shounen-ai undertones in it which can get quite obvious sometimes. Plus there aren&#039;t any annoying girls. I don&#039;t mind cool girls, but an annoying girl tends to be a turn-off. I also didn&#039;t mind it being slow-paced. And since the art and sound, which in my opinion are very important, are perfect, the enjoyment gets a 10 too. <br />
<br />
So overall I gave it a 10. Maybe a 9 would be more appropriate since it&#039;s not outstanding if it&#039;s not continued. However I&#039;m going to assume that it will be continued since I&#039;m off to read the manga.

    The real start of my army-bishi-boy-fetish started with &quot;07 Ghost&quot;. There&#039;s a nice intricate mystery surrounding the protagonist Teito Klein (and yes, there is a cliche in anime sometimes for a huge mystery in the protagonist&#039;s life). But I will go along with it if you have something new to offer up to the cliche. And this did. The art is outstanding-- very colorful and decorative, especially for the design of the churches. The music is gorgeous--very light, flowery, and... church-like. :3

    I&#039;m sorry, I can&#039;t take it anymore.<br />
<br />
Enough is enough. <br />
<br />
The first episode is so promising. It was fast paced and opens a lot of potentials. But, it suddenly digs its own pit hole. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not against cheesy moments between boys, a little bromance won&#039;t bite. But..it&#039;s TOO MUCH!! Lame...lame...lame....to the extent of being PATHETIC. Yes, TEITO KLEIN is so PATHETIC!! <br />
<br />
The other surrounding characters look cool, even Ayanami (Main Villain). But, Teito destroys it. Well, even his bestfriend, Mikage. They are both PATHETIC. Are these boys really from the ARMY? Well, it&#039;s not that bad to have those kinds of men, but their BROTHERHOOD is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19934">
        so OVER THE TOP!! <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve reached episode 7, but wasn&#039;t able to finish it. I still don&#039;t know the story. It&#039;s really confusing. I don&#039;t know what they are fighting for. Images of the past of Teito confuses him, but IT MORE CONFUSES ME!! Every episode will test your patience. But, I won&#039;t be betting anymore. <br />
<br />
My only regret is that I wont be able to see the 7 Ghosts, and I hope Teito is not part of it. My golly!! He&#039;s the LAMEST MAIN CHARACTER EVER BORN!!<br />
<br />
HOW COULD BE THIS POPULAR? Well, I think I know the answer because, I myself, was deceived. I don&#039;t think I can recommend it. but I know my sister will like this. **Sigh** <br />
<br />
and also before I forgot.........<br />
<br />
WHY IN THE WORLD IS TEITO STILL IN HANDCUFFS???? <br />
<br />

From someone-who-wishes-there-would-be-even-a-single-strong-female-character-who-could-spank-Teito-in-the-face,<br />

    I passed this one off thinking that it&#039;s a mecha anime from the cover- but what i got to see was the totally opposite of it. Teito was an orphan slave boy from a slaughtered kingdom which he gets trained as a killing machine but then accidentally suffers rehabilitation from the church.   <br />
<br />
Story: This story is pretty unique- and i hate criticizing it. The whole story except for the characters is a metaphor: the battle between light and darkness is the main theme here. Biblical Illusions are every where- St Michael, Raphael, Gabriel- their powers, chants, crosses,nuns every thing needed to make a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176115">
        religious settlement was there. <br />
It&#039;s suppose to be a small mystery- and as you go forward you see that the pieces of the puzzle fitting perfectly. It had two similar references to both Naruto(Kyuubi) and Hunter X Hunter(exam). There&#039;s a battle system which is less complicated and more close to reality. But all in all the main message is not violence but kindness.<br />
<br />
Art: I bet it&#039;s pretty hard to draw religious characters and to portray them. All characters were drawn gorgeously, young or old, man or woman justice was done to the art. An ancient language of some kind is used to represent that words do really have immense power. I liked how the architectural design of the air-crafts,church and gardens were done, it totally fits the calm and nostalgic atmosphere.  It gave a homely feeling- probably because it all happens within a church.<br />
<br />
Sound: Loved the choir like music- it had some instrumentals which reminds me of an old game named &quot;Septerra Core&quot; and the OP and ED was totally suitable. This is an instance where the ED is better than the OP in my case however i liked them equally. The Seiyus did there job here without any flaws. <br />
<br />
Character: The three bishops were quite similar to the three arc-angels. Bishop Frau represents the offense in the name of St. Michael, Bishop Castor is similar to St. Raphael being the healer whilst Bishop Labrador fulfills the role as Gabriel which means the &quot;Messenger&quot;  Those three, without doubt represented purity, love and forgiveness. The male lead Teito is a developing character, he is growing and so is he&#039;s friend Hakuren. It has a Kyuubi reference from Naruto where he learns or decides whether power should be used for goodness or darkness.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I think the bonds of the characters is very strong and is highly admirable- it&#039;s really satisfying to see a church like atmosphere as the main headquarters or the center point of an anime thus it was unique. There were some average jokes here and there, there were also fantasy characters which adds more cuteness and i was really sad that the anime ended.<br />
<br />
Overall: This anime is like a tunnel of philosophy or a teacher of good things- the metaphors were represented so bluntly that it really makes you think what the male lead&#039;s going through like: &quot;What&#039;s my worst fear- how will i handle it if i face it?&quot; or &quot;Is there any justice without love?&quot; It also teaches that hatred just lives on like a cycle hurting you and that forgiveness is the best option. For the young generation even though it had no romantic interests in it, personally i think it portrays the bitter sweetness of true friendship and respecting who&#039;s worth to be respected. <br />
<br />

    I stumbled upon this anime by going through a list of names and I found it quite interesting and unique. I usually stick to old anime but this one for some reason really got to me so let&#039;s start this review.<br />
<br />
    Let&#039;s start with the story, it revolves around this orphan named Teito who&#039;s enrolled in this military when at some point he escapes from the academy and ends up at the barsburg church which is a place that teaches the complete opposite from the military but still has combat training except for the good. That already got me intrigued, I&#039;ve always

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38103">
        liked religious relations in animes especially christianity and whatnot because it kind of relates to me since I am a christian after all, and it doesn&#039;t stop there, the story gets more complicated as more characters are introduced, and the good thing about it is the fact that not too much information is being said about those characters which leaves so much room for more intense discoveries. Although I do admit there were some episodes where it was purely talking and with an anime that had a &quot;war like&quot; setting you expect more action than blabbering, but it can&#039;t be helped the more the characters talk the more important the actions will be. I would emphasize more on the storyline but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll accidentally say some things that shouldn&#039;t be said for people who haven&#039;t seen it yet. Overall the story is really good, it&#039;s not one of those animes where it&#039;s plain and linear, it really gives a lot of mystery and makes you think alot about who to trust and whatnot, I just wish they&#039;d continue it somehow.<br />
<br />
    I have one thing to say about the art and it&#039;s that I don&#039;t have a problem with it whatsoever, this anime was made in 2009 so you can already tell by the year that they pretty much advanced themselves already. the colours are beautiful, the choice of scenery and angles that the animators chose are well placed and picked out, nothing seems too out of place, except for those mermaids... like why are there mermaids... whatever lol<br />
<br />
    The chracters in the anime are very unique and well made. The main chracter could use some more sense, honestly one thing I really hate about some animes is when the main character gets really annoying and that&#039;s never good considering you&#039;d have to see him/her in every episode, I mean don&#039;t get me wrong it might be annoying to me but might not to others. As a protagonist, he&#039;s really doing his job as his role, the growth from the first episode up to the last is really believable, you can clearly see the experiences that he went through just to get that far and the writers did a damn well job on their part. <br />
<br />
     One character I really liked was Labrador, he&#039;s one of the bishops of the church and already that gave him that status of authority and leadership. Already from the name you can tell that he&#039;s one hell of an interesting character. He was really into gardening and his powers revolves around using plants and poison against his enemies.Pretty cool in my opinion.<br />
<br />
    This anime has a lot of biblical references but nothing offensive or anything like that towards the people who are in that religion. The Japanese always know how to make almost everything in our lives interesting and cool and they did a really good job with this anime, next time I go to church, I&#039;ll be expecting some crazy shit to happen just like in the anime haha.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

    I finally finished watching this and... I&#039;m a bit annoyed. I loved it for the first half. I don&#039;t know how much of a spoiler this will be, but the reason why my opinion of the show dropped during the second half is that I realized NOTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. It reminded me quite a bit of Amatsuki in that there is a lot of build up for a second season, a game, or something, and it just doesn&#039;t happen. However, it did leave me wanting to read the manga, so I guess that&#039;s something.<br />
<br />
STORY: The story has a great premise that could have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25110">
        been developed much better than it was. I felt like towards the end of the anime they were shoving too much down our throats, and it just didn&#039;t work out. I guess that&#039;s what the manga&#039;s for though =/<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: First off, I can&#039;t figure out why this isn&#039;t in the shounen ai genre. There&#039;s a LOT of heavy alluding to what could be and friendships that seem a little too close. Heck, the sub team that I watched even did a parody subbed episode about the relationships going on between some of the characters.<br />
<br />
Anyway! Enough griping about that. I loved this show at first. My problem with the characters overall is that the villains aren&#039;t developed at ALL but you&#039;re expected to know them, like them/hate them, etc. Also, during the 25 episodes there&#039;s a whole lot of talking about how the characters became better people, blah blah blah but I just don&#039;t see a whole lot of character development. I kept waiting for a big reveal of some of the others, and explanation for one in particular, but it never happened. Very disappointing.<br />
<br />
SOUND: One of the minor characters is an organist. You&#039;d think they&#039;d have more than 3 looping music tracks if they&#039;re making someone an instrument player.<br />
<br />
ART: Gorgeous! One of the reasons I kept watching it. It&#039;s funny though; I was watching Ouran High School with my son and changed over to 07 Ghost and he couldn&#039;t tell the difference in characters the art is so similar!

    okay.. 07 ghost. uhm...<br />
<br />
i was really looking forward to this anime from the very beginning and glad to say, it did not fail me :)<br />
<br />
story: 10/10 <br />
plot follows the manga loosely. but if you haven&#039;t read the manga, it is one that&#039;d make you want to hold on to. it feels rather melancholic but the battles are breath taking. although the anime falls short as it is, i think they&#039;ll be making a second season. yay! ^__^<br />
<br />
art: 10/10<br />
art is almost the same as in the manga, only better. if you love bishounen, definitely give this a shot. (implied shounen-ai or maybe that&#039;s just me. tehe!)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26474">
        the animation is good as well. i might have overrated it a bit, but that&#039;s just how i am. ehe..<br />
<br />
sound: 8/10<br />
i didn&#039;t pay much attention to sound actually. i liked the OST and the seiyuus were terrfic, but i wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s perfect.<br />
<br />
character: 10/10<br />
teito klein is actually a good main! he is one that makes up the whole melancholic atmosphere in the show, but glad to say some perverted bishop lightens up the mood. haha. the bishops here are reaaally different from reality but you&#039;ll surely find them interesting. the fiend in the story is hot! haha. seriously.<br />
<br />
enjoyment: 9/10<br />
i found myself bored at some instances when the main laments over and over the same thing. it&#039;s sickening but he&#039;s adorable when he does so let it pass. there aren&#039;t much side stories yet so at least we know where to focus.<br />
<br />
overall: 9/10<br />
why 9 when i sounded like i&#039;m going to give it a 10? well, that&#039;s because there&#039;s a second season that&#039;s going to be released in the near future! i gave it a 9 because i know the next season will be a ten! haha :) yes, it can only get better.<br />
 <br />
owari :)

    What got me to watch this is because it had some &#039;action&#039; and &#039;good artwork&#039;.<br />
As the show went on the reasoning of the characters were interesting too. It has funny and serious scenes. The background music matched the moods swings too well. Good audio visual enjoyment.<br />
<br />
The 07 ghosts don&#039;t literally play as see through ghostly beings all the time..  They seem &quot;living&quot; normal. I liked that idea. Each has a different character, unique powers and one objective. Only 5 of the ghosts appear in the anime. You must read the manga to know more about them. The manga is ongoing and seems so predictable.<br />

Each characters&#039; influence on the main character and his relationship with them motivates the character development of the protagonist.<br />
As his past memories unlocks by certain events, he realizes the value of his life with reasoning based on the lives sacrificed in the past. <br />
He gets caught between revenge and what his true mission should be..well the protagonist matures enough to decide his path and sets on to fulfill his mission. <br />
This was a beautiful execution.<br />
<br />
Regarding the plot, everything that happens even the tragic ones turns out to be a favorable event, all designed to direct the main character&#039;s path.<br />
In the initial episodes, sometimes it is frustrating to see the boy confused, when everybody else seems to know something about him, which he doesn&#039;t know himself.<br />
<br />
The sound was great, to the extent that i downloaded the soundtrack of the series.<br />
<br />
And why i gave an overall rating 9 is because it suited my mood back then. This doesn&#039;t apply generally.
