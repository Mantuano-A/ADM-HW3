    Adaptations are becoming a bit of a thorny issue in anime these days, which is a bit odd considering how many are produced every year. The constant conversion of stories from other media is a pretty lucrative business as there&#039;s already an established market for the end product and its merchandise, regardless of how good the show actually is. Like anything in life though, there&#039;s a price to pay, and there are increasing concerns about the impact adaptations are having on original works. The resulting negative effect on script and screen writers is beginning to be felt throughout the industry as studios everywhere are finding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35674">
        that their creative teams are slowly becoming unable to develop original concepts into viable storylines. The reason for this is purely because in comparative terms, it takes more effort, imagination and skill to make something original than it does to rework something that already exists, and if one doesn&#039;t regularly exercise their &quot;mental muscles&quot; in a substantial manner, then their creativity will begin to stagnate.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the reason why we get anime like Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance).<br />
<br />
The series begins with Agemaki Wako and Shindo Sugata as the pair take a moonlit stroll along a beach on the fictional Southern Cross Island. Along the way Wako detects the scent of of someone she doesn&#039;t know, and following the trail, she and Sugata find a young man who has been washed ashore. He is Tsunashi Takuto, and his arrival on the island will awaken his destiny.<br />
<br />
Well, that all sounds pretty heroic, but that&#039;s about as far as it goes. Star Driver may initially seem like an interesting proposition, but many of the plot themes are never fully realised, which only exacerbates the fact that there is simply too much going on in the storyline. The series makes some rather nice subtextual introductions at certain points, but no matter how important these may be to plot or character development, they&#039;re never fully utilised and thus become the equivalent of the human appendix (i.e. totally useless).<br />
<br />
The storyline progression is handled in the standard &quot;fight of the week&quot; manner that is so prevalent in shounen anime and manga, but alongside that Enokido Yoji (series composition and script writer), and director Igarashi Takuya (Soul Eater, Ashita no Nadja, Doremi), have seen fit to add a number of themes that only serve to confuse the audience. In addition to this there are a number of questions that remain unanswered come the end of the series, which may hint at an attempt to have the viewer infer the relevant information rather than outright carelessness.<br />
<br />
That doesn&#039;t mean the storyline is bad though. While there may be a degree of confusion, Star Driver does offer up some interesting ideas that could have taken the show in a new direction.<br />
<br />
Visually the series is a bit of an odd blend as while the concept is predominantly shounen, several of the male characters have a decidedly bishounen look to them. Star Driver seems to play on this by naming Takuto&#039;s alter ego the Galactic Pretty Boy, but it&#039;s difficult to tell if this is an attempt to parody the character style. That said, there&#039;s a mundanity to the overall design that no amount of beautification can remove, partly because everyone is supposed to look good, but mainly because there seems to be a limited range of expressions.<br />
<br />
While there are a few scenes that depict specific feelings rather well, the majority of the time the characters display very little emotion, and many of the more expressive moments can seem forced or contrived. In addition to this, the complicated and overly sexualised costumes of Glittering Star, the weird posturing, the rather odd mahou shoujo style transformation sequence when Takuto summons Tauburn, and even the design of Tauburn itself, all promote the idea that Star Driver is a parody anime, and this conflicts with the serious tone of the show.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Tauburn ...<br />
<br />
The conceptualisation of the cybodies is interesting in that it highlights a degree of innovation and originality, which is odd when one considers the slightly banal approach to character design. There&#039;s a novelty to the mechas that&#039;s nice to see, especially Tauburn&#039;s rather obvious court dandy/musketeer influenced look, so the obvious question is why the same innovative approach wasn&#039;t taken with the characters themselves. The backgrounds also suffer from a similar mundanity, which is a little disconcerting given the nicely surreal overtones of Zero Time.<br />
<br />
As for the animation, the character movements are pretty standard, but the action sequences are often fluid and well choreographed. Unfortunately this is overshadowed by the the fact that specific scenes have simply been re-used to the point where viewers may find themselves skipping particular moments, and while this tends to be a fairly common practice in &quot;fight of the week&quot; shows, it still smacks of laziness.<br />
<br />
Which neatly leads me on to the audio side of the series.<br />
<br />
Star Driver initially seems to be well served in the acting department thanks to the experience of Miyano Mamoru (Takuto), Hayami Saori (Wako), Fukuyama Jun (Sugata), and the rest of the cast, so it&#039;s a bit strange that many of the roles seem shallow and forced. Part of the reason for this is the lack of facial response on the characters themselves as this gives the impression that the seiyuu are trying too hard, but the script is also to blame as much of the dialogue seems to have been written just to fill in the gaps. All of this makes the voice acting a much more difficult proposition as the seiyuu are often forced to compensate for poor writing.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the effects are well timed and very clear, and one of the nice things about this show is how it doesn&#039;t use music, as background tracks are often reserved for occasions of emotive importance or action sequences. There are also two opening and ending themes for the series, and while they tend to have a slightly upbeat feel to them, they seem to work well with Star Driver&#039;s major theme.<br />
<br />
Possibly the biggest issue though, is the lack of substantial development on the part of the characters, which could have been somewhat offset had they been clearly defined from the start. Unfortunately this is not the case, and while viewers are given the facade of progression through interactions, conversations, and even action sequences, in reality there is only one thing learned throughout the whole show, and this only occurs in the final episode. In addition to this there are few explanations forthcoming about why the members of Glittering Star are so determined to use the cybodies, and the only thing that seems to tie their actions into the story is something called The Departure (which is another thing that isn&#039;t properly explained).<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s not the worst part.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, the characters are dumb, and leading the idiocy is Takuto. The very first episode has him entering the enemy base, but for some reason he &quot;forgets&quot; that he&#039;s been to the heart of Glittering Star&#039;s operation, and so the secret society is left to continue their work relatively unimpeded. This is possibly the biggest hole in the plot as at that point Takuto is aware of the enemy, knows where they and who their target is, and could very easily expedite a much simpler and shorter resolution. Because of this the so-called past traumas, the posturing, the banality of the high school setting, pretty much everything used to define the characters in some manner, all become slightly ridiculous.<br />
<br />
So, where does that leave us? Well, on the surface this seems like a pretty solid proposition, especially with Enokido Yoji (who wrote the screenplay for Diebuster), taking part on the production side, and there are some enjoyable moments that occur throughout the series. Star Driver is nothing if not an interesting idea that tries to approach certain concepts from a different angle, and the little touches of innovation here and there add a pleasing quirkiness to proceedings.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it&#039;s not enough as the series retains a ridiculous quality that isn&#039;t helped by a decidedly sub-par script, seemingly emotionless characters, and the lack of any substantial explanations. Star Driver tries to do too much with too little, and the apparent attempts at parodying certain themes only adds to the confusion and makes the plot more convoluted and overly complicated.<br />
<br />
This may not be an adaptation of any sort, but that doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s automatically good, regardless of who worked on it. There are some positives within the series, but ultimately this is nothing more than mediocrity at its finest.<br />
<br />
The fault lies solely with Bones, who in the last two years have produced one original anime franchise (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0). Everything else has been an extension of an existing title, or an adaptation from another medium. Unfortunately they&#039;re just one studio out of many that continue to try and cash in on the popularity of something else, with no regard for the effect this has on the viewer or the industry itself. After all, it&#039;s easier to blame things like fansubs for falling sales rather than admit that what you&#039;ve produced is nothing more than average.

    Star Driver has been one hell of a polarizing anime since day 1. Some people were initially on board because it looked like a throw-back to old school mecha. Some watched it because it looked like a full on parody of 90&#039;s anime with the ridiculous nature of the show combined with the over-the-top style. And even more watched it because it was penned by the same guy who did the composition for Revolutionary Girl Utena, Yoji Enokido. Yet when the credits rolled at the end of episode 25, it was obvious to me and to anyone who stuck with the show that Star Driver

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35664">
        was its own beast so to speak. It incorporated elements of the things I mentioned above yet it never really followed through with any one idea. Surely a mish-mash of these ideas would create schizophrenic anime which tries to do everything and succeeds at nothing, correct? Any other circumstance, I&#039;d tell all of you yes, because there&#039;s absolutely no way an anime like that could ever be good. Yet against all odds, I found myself enjoying Star Driver more and more as the weeks went along until I reached the startling conclusion that hey, Star Driver was good! Not just good but pretty damn awesome and compelling! I wrapped my brain around why I was enjoying it so much, when virtually every aspect of the show was working against it. I mean what kind of anime has the audacity to take itself seriously when the main character&#039;s title is &quot;Galactic Pretty Boy&quot;? The answer is: Star Driver, an anime that somehow manages to pull it all off, and pulls it off with a healthy dosage of fabulousity.<br />
<br />
SD&#039;s story isn&#039;t really something out of the ordinary. A secret organization made up of high schoolers are bent on taking over the world with giant robots that are sealed in a pocket of space/time while some random Mary Sue shows up to thwart them with his own ridiculous giant robot while sporting an equally ridiculous costume and Mahou Shoujo-esque transformation scene. While this is the basic premise of SD (and pretty much every episode), many people will think it gets repetitive pretty soon (and believe me, it does). So why would anyone like it? Well my answer is derived solely from one aspect of the show and that&#039;s primarily the subtlety of the execution. The subtle way exposition is fed to the audience, the subtle way characters are presented and written, it makes for a really compelling style. Its one of aspects that made Utena as good and popular as it was. Now I know BONES&#039; anime have a notorious reputation of not holding the audience&#039;s hand at all when it comes to story-telling and much of it becomes read in-between the lines or not addressed at all. Star Driver also does this, but only to a degree. It&#039;s not so vague that it becomes frustrating but its mysterious enough to compel the audience to continue watching. It gives the audience a chance to think about the plot and characters by themselves and tactfully delivers the answers later at an appropriate time. This is a grand form of storytelling not because the story itself is good but mainly because of the way its presented. Unfortunately while the storytelling borders on masterful, there are some really annoying pacing problems with the whole package. Case in point, most people will drop this in the first 5 or so episodes. I wouldn&#039;t blame them because the show has very weak start, where characters are very slowly introduced and the show pretty much relies on the mecha fights to carry it for 20 minutes. Didn&#039;t help that the fights were usually only 1-2 minutes long. It slowly builds itself up and it really gets better after episode 7 but I can&#039;t really look favorably at the beginning since it could have played up the shows strength which is characterization instead of lolhijinks and boring-as-hell mecha fights. The show also drags towards the end which is honestly baffling to me since there was plenty of material they could have used to make things interesting. Yup, around the end it sort of reverts back to the formula used at the beginning, but thankfully gets its shit together and ends on a strong note. <br />
<br />
Now like I said earlier, SD&#039;s characters are its strongest point. Even when nothing but high school antics are happening on the screen, there is a sense that everything that happens has some meaning behind it. So when characters often start talking about inane or seemingly pointless topics, it can turn out to be euphemism or a metaphor that has relevance to the plot. Now I don&#039;t mean all the antics and comedy have some ulterior theme to them, sometimes there really are comedy scenes to make the audience laugh but more often then not, you&#039;ll be thinking about some lines of dialogue long after they&#039;ve been said. This brings me to another element that SD does really well and that&#039;s character interactions. Instead of long flashbacks about something or other, character&#039;s personalities are revealed through the way they act around each other, especially when the tone becomes serious. And these are probably the best parts of the show, Sugata&#039;s conflict with Takuto, Mizuno general interactions with her sister, Kanoko&#039;s demeanor and attitude towards the Glittering Crux and Wako&#039;s internal struggle between Takuto and Sugata are all great. Even more impressive is the fact that SD goes out of it&#039;s way to characterize minor characters as well as major characters. You can probably argue that Takuto himself is the Mary Sue and isn&#039;t characterized worth shit but at the same time you could probably write papers on how his real personality is implied in juxtaposition of the Mary Sue front he shows to all the characters and even the audience. Hell you could even write an essay on how his first phase ability makes him the main character of the show with his catch-phrase &quot;Dazzling the stage&quot; as proof of how meta things can appear.  It doesn&#039;t go as far as Utena does but it certainly isn&#039;t a slouch slouch in that regard. <br />
<br />
As per all BONES anime, the art and animation is done very well. There are loads of awesome sakuga cuts for all the animation fans out there. Generally the fights can be very repetitive with Takuto winning all the time but the animation can make them very exciting sometimes. It doesn&#039;t happen too often since I can count the number of times where everything aligns on one hand but when the art, animation, plot and music are all synched in excellence, it becomes very awesome.  But be warned, this isn&#039;t really an anime where the mecha fights are the most important part of the show, most of the backlash towards the beginning happened because the mecha bits were actually the worst parts. Mostly because the fights are nothing more than a tool for characterization in the end and you&#039;re enjoyment of it will revolve around how much you care for the character that fights Takuto. I won&#039;t say the mecha aspect is downright terrible, but I honestly think they could have better implemented the Cybody fights to coincide more with the plot than the characters. Some of the best episodes in the show don&#039;t even have any fights in them. The sound on the other hand is really good and is strong throughout the show. SD has some of the best insert songs I&#039;ve heard in quite a while (like Monochrome) and uses them very efficiently. The other tracks manage to keep up with the vocal ones as well, so its not like the rest of the OST is bleh in comparison. The voice work is also typically good, the best performances come from Jun Fukuyama as Sugata, Ayano Niina as Kanako and Akira Ishida as Head. Can&#039;t say I&#039;m not sick of Mamoru Miyano after watching a lot of animu but he pulls off Takuto&#039;s happy-go-lucky attitude well enough and still manages to convey his more serious moments with the appropriate tension.  <br />
<br />
Star Driver really turned out to be that one show you liked but couldn&#039;t really point out why. Kudos to all those people who stuck with it through thick and thin, god knows it tried our patience many times. But for all its apparent shortcomings like derp pacing, flaky mecha moments and wasted potential, it still manged to be one hell of an anime, and a great ride. I&#039;ll definitely miss the Saturdays where I stayed up all night into the wee hours of Sunday morning discussing the newest episode and whatnot. If you haven&#039;t watched it, I recommend really pushing through those first couple episodes because they&#039;re not the best this anime has to offer. Star Driver offers a really unique experience that I haven&#039;t seen in much-if any anime, so I strongly recommend it.<br />

    You know how, like when you were a kid, you&#039;d ask for a bedtime story that wasn&#039;t from the book? For me, that&#039;s what Star Driver is. It&#039;s one of those stories that&#039;s just... different. Maybe there are animes that could be similar, but this one just stands out. <br />
<br />
If you think about it, the story is simple. The Galactic Pretty Boy has to defeat the Glittering Crux Brigade, in order to... well, we&#039;re looking for &#039;save the world&#039;, I guess? Other than the names, it sounds pretty generic, but I gave it a perfect 10. Not because of some sort of game-breaking plot device

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32374">
        that ultimately makes the plot 10 times cooler, but it&#039;s simply how they pull it off. Even if some parts are cliche, it&#039;s still pretty original.<br />
<br />
Now, art. I just have to say, Tauburn is the pimping-est looking mecha in the history of ever. All the mechas (or Cybodys) have very vivid and special qualities, making them different to each other. All with very good color schemes, and unique designs. The characters are pretty well done. Sort of like Code Geass, where they go for the tall skinny characters. But unlike Code Geass, characters are younger, and for me, are a bit more proportioned. I give it a 10.<br />
<br />
Voice acting, opening theme song, ending theme song, background music, sound effects... Oh, and a special song that plays whenever they fight.... It suits the anime perfectly. There&#039;s really not much to say here. No complaints whatsoever. 10.<br />
<br />
Well, since I don&#039;t want to name names and spoil anything, I shall just refer to them by the color of their hair. Red is the lively and upbeat type of person. Believes in good, yadda yadda, all that jazz. Common in a main character, so no complaints there. Yellow is the normal-ish clueless one, and Blue is the quiet and mysterious ones. Alright, the mains are a bit generic, but as I said earlier, it&#039;s how they pull them off. The supporting cast are a colorful (Both hair-color-wise and personality-wise) set really able to help tell the story of Star Driver. Plus, the development with all of them, God, it&#039;s just freaking good... (Yes, I can be creepy)<br />
<br />
Overall, I really like the anime. I enjoy every episode, and I think a lot more people should watch it. There are currently nine episodes right now, and each one is good. It&#039;s an unusual mecha anime, of which the likes I haven&#039;t seen in awhile, and of which I hope to see more of soon. <br />
<br />
Have fun.

    I&#039;ve never seen an anime get so many high ratings for reviews, while I think it&#039;s pretty crappy. I saw this anime in the January 2011 copy of the Japanese Newtype, and thought it seemed interesting enough so I decided to watch it. I liked how the characters looked, and it seemed vaguely interesting, but my high hopes were soon shot down.  I don&#039;t know if I am missing the pure genius of this anime, or if I just see past all the jiggling boobs and girls who want to tap everything, and see the series for the pile of nonsense it is. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38621">
        SPOILERS, KINDA SORTA, DOWN THERE VVVV. <br />
<br />
The series had a good start, but after seeing a scene where maids randomly had cat ears and 4 foot bunny ears on, I grew worried of the fate of this series in my eyes. Yada yada, school stuff, yada yada. &quot;DON&#039;T GO TO THE OLD GOLD MINE KIDS&quot; -cut scene to gold mine with girl in her discount sexy time outfit- . Why they decided to buy out a circus and Mardi Gras surplus store, and make the girls dress like they are at a S&amp;M club is beyond me. I just can&#039;t really take characters seriously if they are looking like a jester reject while wearing a cheesy gold mask with a beak. Just the whole lair in the gold mine thing just baffles me, everything about it. It just seems so stupid to me. Every time they&#039;d have one of their evil group meetings, I&#039;d be forced to wait through 4 minutes of all the girls re-crossing their legs 40 times, and shots of their legs and garters. God forbid we see their faces. There also sometimes would be random cheering or booing from what I will assume are 100 fat old hairy men lurking in the shadows, since They never really show any of the other members. <br />
<br />
In the first 2 episodes, they decided to reuse several scenes like 5 times, and made jokes about 4 times of how wacko, oh i mean Wako is always hungry. There is also really awkward staring scenes between our hero GALACTIC PRETTY BOY and Wako, and throughout the next 4 episodes they try to show that the two are crushing on each other (uh, hello, you already made that clear in the first episode). I thought the mecha stuff was pretty cool, but in the course of 2 episodes having the same type of fights, and the same ending was kind of over kill I think. I&#039;M GOING TO WIN, GRRRRR. -gets destroyed after a few seconds- OH NOO, -stumbles out- FIRST THINGS FIRST, WE ARE TAKING YOUR LITTLE BADGE THING, GET OUT OF HERE AND GO WORK OUT IN YOUR DARK ROOM, YOU AREN&#039;T IN OUR CLUB ANYMORE. Also, what was the point of kidnapping Wako in the first place, if she magically appears in her little bubble thing whenever a fight is going to occur while she is doing random things. Let&#039;s just pray that she isn&#039;t taking a dump one day, and she is force bubbled into a fight scene. At only 4 episodes in, they don&#039;t really explain what all this maiden and mecha stuff is very much. Why do these things even exist? How do only certain people have the power to control them, and why do they have to use those ugly masks? <br />
<br />
Oh, and apparently every time someone is about to fight, the random fish girl in the cage has to start singing. After 3 or 4 times of this, I had enough. I have no idea who this fish girl is, or why she is in a cage or anything. All she does is just play with a chain, and tell really boring stories to some guy that uses way too much hair gel and just rolls around on some couch. <br />
<br />
Me being a girl, and not a lesbian, the naked scenes, boob jiggling, random make out scenes, and panty shots didn&#039;t really win me over. Apparently to be in the villain club and a girl, you need to show everyone you are horny, and either make out with people, try to rape them, or be about to kiss them. Apparently the thing to do is to kiss through glass. A moment that made me &quot;wut&quot; was when the stacked green hair girl starts regaling the class (while the teacher is talking) about how she is married to some 65 year old and how she gets &quot;lonely&quot; at night. Who does this. No on in real life for sure. She also decides to get a hair cut (it doesn&#039;t look different) in the middle of the classroom during lunch time. <br />
<br />
Why she lives on a cruise boat and has a alligator in some dirty pool, I have no idea. LOL DON&#039;T WORRY GUIS HE IS A FRIENDLY ALLIGATOR! <br />
<br />
Overall, this series had the basis for something really cool, but IN MY OPINION fan service and just trying too hard made this series pretty sucky. I really liked the opening though, so props for that. Too bad I don&#039;t like the series. It was pretty bland, and could be a lot more interesting. It was also really confusing at times, and I felt as if parts were cut out or that there was a really sudden scene change. The characters had personality, but some of them showed none or only stood out because of there hair color. Maybe this series gets better in the later episodes, but I think I&#039;ll pass on this series. <br />

    Before I begin, I must say that I have only seen the first episode. Also, I felt the need to write this based on finding the previous review pretty inarticulate, and slightly off-base, however, people are entitled to their own opinions.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
Yes, the previous review was somewhat right, in that there is a lot thrown at you, but it really isn&#039;t that hard to keep up with. Also, it&#039;s to be expected that the first episode gives the audience a lot in order to pull in a big audience. It also makes me a lot more intrigued than turned off. It is a little over

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31093">
        the top, calling the main character&#039;s newfound power &quot;Galactic Pretty Boy,&quot; but it was enjoyable, nonetheless, and honestly, there&#039;s worse out there.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Art is great, and so is the action. They insert a mecha fight scene into the 30 min segment that they are given, and it comes in a little randomly, there are many questions that pop up for the audience, but it was done very well.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I loved it. The background music was better than a lot of series I&#039;ve watched. Opening and closing scenes were nice (and the animation to accompany them was great.)<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This is a little shaky because there was so much introduced in one episode that it makes the characters seem very underdeveloped and random. However, keeping in mind that this is the first episode, and I am very curious as to how it all pans out. I like the characters so far at least.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
REMEMBER - THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON THE FIRST EPISODE ONLY. <br />
Anyways, I would definitely give this series a try. The opening song with the animation really sparked my curiosity because it revealed a little more about what is to come. The only thing I would really look out for in the upcoming episodes is character development, and obviously plot development (leaving too many questions for the audience, making too many random actions, etc).

    Remember when you used to watch Sailor Moon/Pokemon back in the days and you were so dedicated to the show, not missing an episode, even though each episode was so predictable and had so many repeated sequences that it&#039;s almost laughable?  But you loved every minute of it and couldn&#039;t stop watching!<br />
<br />
Well, Star Driver reminds me of those shows.  Each episode contains the same confrontations, the same transformation sequences, the same fight sequences and same slap-stick comedy between the main trio.  But there&#039;s just something about the show that just hooks me to it.  Maybe it&#039;s the fact that it moves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34660">
        beyond shows like Sailor Moon and delivers a decent plot, crisp art, great soundtrack, and extremely likable characters (with pretty costumes to boot!)<br />
<br />
Takuto, the show&#039;s hero, ends up half drowned on a remote island.  There, he meets Wako, a happy-go-lucky shrine maiden and Sugata, the cool quiet guy.  He ends up going to their school which turns out to be a lair for these giant mecha robots called &#039;cybodies&#039;.  Turns out most of the school can pilot these things and what do you know, Takuto can pilot one too.  Complete with his own transformation sequence (because guys need them too!), he turns into Ginga Bishounen (Galactic Pretty Boy) to protect Wako from the &#039;bad&#039; cybodies.<br />
<br />
Like I said, story from episode to episode is pretty much the same thing, only with different characters.  But the little side stories and funny moments they add really boosts the enjoyment factor (like Wako&#039;s BL fantasies). The beginning episodes give you little snippets and hints for the main plot, then it really starts delving into it starting in episode 20.<br />
<br />
Art is superb, it&#039;s been the only show where I&#039;ve actually noticed characters eye movements and blinking.  They definitely did a great job with the details and didn&#039;t cheap out with the panels. Even the repeated transformation sequences are quite tolerable with the great graphics ;)  Might I add I love their costume designs too!<br />
<br />
The cast is amazing too, Fukuyama Jun (ie. Lelouch, Grell) plays Sugata,  Miyano Mamoru (ie. Light, Zero) plays Takuto. OP/ENDINGS are catchy and I do like the random songs the characters sing from time to time.<br />
<br />
The characters have taken on almost stereotypical standard character types from anime.  Takuto is the bright, optimistic guy, Sugata is the cool, level headed pretty boy.  Wako is your damsel in distress but still very likable.  While not entirely original, it&#039;s been tried and true.  The antagonists are well introduced, each with their background story and specific quirks, they actually don&#039;t really feel like bad guys.  It&#039;s really easy to get attached to the characters.<br />
<br />
To be honest, my enjoyment rating is higher than all the other ratings (I gave it a 9), which doesn&#039;t really add up.  But I have to say that I am really addicted to this anime at the moment.  I definitely recommend for others to try, maybe more so for the girls since I feel there&#039;s some male fanservice going on in here (if the transformation sequence is any indication) =P  All in all, a fun enjoyable watch!<br />

<br />
&quot;Grand Entrance! Galactic Pretty Boy! Tauburn!!!&quot; Such a stupid and embarrassing line that I would never repeat in public in a million years, but there&#039;s something about this series that&#039;s just so captivating and moving.<br />
<br />
&#039;STAR DRIVER: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance)&#039; is like a homage to various &#039;70s mecha anime. Everything about this series screams of classic Japanese mecha, superhero, and tokusatsu, while many modern elements, for better or worse, are also incorporated. The surprise is: Everything clicks.<br />
<br />
The story of &#039;STAR DRIVER&#039; is summarized by caged girl in the beginning and later in the school play: &quot;Planet of Fish&quot;. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36843">
        evil organization &quot;Kiraboshi&quot; aims to reach the stars by breaking all 4 seals of Zero Time and activate cybodies in real life. Kiraboshi&#039;s leader is akin to Sam in the &quot;Planet of Fish&quot; story. On the other hand, Takuto tries to destroy all cybodies so that Mako, the Southern Seal, can leave the island. He represents Mark from the school play. Episodes take the monster-of-the-week format à la &#039;70s mecha.<br />
<br />
The characters are the archetype heroes and villains from classic mecha. Our protagonist Takuto is like one of those classic superhero who&#039;s good at everything, likes to help everyone, and has such a strong sense of justice that he&#039;s almost naive. Yes, super robots were never meant to be piloted by weak indecisive morons, they were supposed to be piloted by superheroes that kids admire. The hero proactively engaging into the battle to make the world a better place, is a nice change from most recent mecha series. On the other hand, the antagonists are all in an apparently evil organization shrouded by mystery. This character setup is proven to work over and over in iconic classic mecha series.<br />
<br />
Scene recycling is prevalent like the retro shows, with cybercasket scene looking like classic mecha sortie, Tauburn appearance scenes recycled with CG-assisted backgrounds, hero &#039;Sailor Moon&#039; transformation into uniform. The enemy mecha even explode with delay, &#039;Kamen Rider&#039; style, having the protagonist&#039;s mecha looking all cool in the foreground after pulling off some awesome move.<br />
<br />
Almost every single mecha moves are borrowed from famous &#039;70s anime. Yes, the pilots even scream out the signature move names! These are just few that I noticed (and still remember):<br />
* Tauburn: &quot;Tau Galaxy Beam&quot; - Mazinger Z &quot;Breast Fire&quot;<br />
* Tauburn: &quot;Tau Missile&quot; - Getter1 &quot;Shining Spark&quot;<br />
* Tauburn: &quot;Galactic Cross Cut&quot; - Daltanious &quot;Flame Sword Cross Cut&quot;, Voltes V &quot;V Letter Cut&quot;?<br />
* Tauburn: &quot;Pile&quot; Attacks - Nu-Gundam &quot;Fin Funnel&quot; Attacks<br />
* Tauburn: &quot;Pile Crusher&quot; - Getter2 &quot;Drill Punch&quot;<br />
* Tetrioht: Bike attack - Combattler V &quot;Gran Dasher&quot;?<br />
* Qophlite: Flight mode - Transformers?<br />
<br />
The retro influence can even be found in music for this show. Did the insert songs leading up to, and during battles remind anyone else of &#039;Mothra&#039;? The two main insert songs were absolutely brilliant. Catchy and well edited, more importantly, godly audio mixing that matched perfectly with every single episode&#039;s battle initiation.<br />
<br />
&quot;STAR DRIVER&quot; must seem like an outdated &#039;70s knockoff by now, but there are also many modern elements mixed in.<br />
<br />
Story-wise, the pacing is excellent. It was so captivating that I didn&#039;t mind the excessive corniness, and just wanted to know what will happen next. It seems like battle in alternate space is a fad this season, with &#039;Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica&#039; and &#039;Yumekui Merry&#039; following the same format. Our heroes are taken to &quot;Zero Time&quot; by Kiraboshi in nearly every episode, where they fight like crazy for the fate of the Earth, unbeknownst to rest of the world. The show ends with a generic modern epic final battle where the protagonist transcends an (supposedly) insurmountable power in the universe. We&#039;ve seen it in other mecha series like &#039;Gurren Lagann&#039;, &#039;Asura Cryin&#039;, &#039;Heroic Age&#039; etc. Unlike those mecha series with fail endings, &#039;STAR DRIVER&#039; never got too serious, and maintained the so-bad-it&#039;s-actually-good atmosphere throughout by almost making fun of itself by rolling out one retro cliché after another, thus the corny ending actually worked.<br />
<br />
The show also had healthy amounts of harem and ecchi. It&#039;s true every girl in the show were head-over-heels for Takuto or Sugata. However, both of those two main characters knew exactly who they liked, and also didn&#039;t have to act like a thickheaded retards most of the time, and just brushed off girls they&#039;re not interested in. Additionally, those guys are supposedly extremely good looking, and have decent personality or mystique, so it wasn&#039;t too far-fetched that they were the most popular guys on the island (yes, living in an island give girls limited choice too). The ecchi was present in Kiraboshi female costumes and cybercasket scenes, but the girls didn&#039;t trip randomly for panchira and the camera wasn&#039;t constantly shooting up to their panties. Although these elements exist as little bonuses, they were never detrimental to the show.<br />
<br />
The modern artwork is magnificent. Mecha, character, and costume designs were very unique, and the battle scenes were very exciting with fluid action. The visuals were so nice that the horrible CG-assisted recycled scenes seemed to be deliberately done for &#039;70s influence, so-bad-it&#039;s-actually good. While the scenery in Zero Time was always amazing, the ordinary world was a bit too bland.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is wonderful, especially for that of Takuto, Kanako, and Keito. All of were perfect fit for respective characters, and very emotional tones in key scenes. BGM were decent, some of them quite memorable. The OP by Aqua Timez was perfect for the theme, and addictive like most of their tie-ups.<br />
<br />
&#039;STAR DRIVER&#039; was a highly nostalgic mecha series for me, which successfully blended the tried-and-true retro qualities with cliché modern elements to create something completely different. Admittedly, there is the gayness of Galactic Pretty Boy and Kiraboshi members, the abundant corniness, and certain plot holes (like why don&#039;t they just shoot Takuto in real life?) that the viewer must overcome, but I believe series like this is what anime is all about. This is one of those series where you have to stop thinking and just feel the show. Is there still a child in you?

    Overall: star driver is a very colorful and action oriented mecha anime which stars a red haired bishonen Takuto.<br />
<br />
Story: What can I say, it has been done before, better.  An organization on the island, Glittering Crux wants to unlock the power of the cybodies (the mechs) and use them for....Something.  The cybodies can only be used in zero time, some alternate dimension, and Crux wants to break the powers of the 4 maidens on the island to be able to use cybodies in real space.  This all sounds well in good, its just the execution of the whole concept is pretty subpar

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32637">
        for an anime being released in 2010.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Note: the reason for the low story marks is because the charecters dick around in school or the island and it is no were near as funny or fulfilling as other mecha anime, namely any Gundam show, or its much closer cousin full metal panic.  If you have not seen full mental panic and are reading this, go see it.  Its infinitely better than Star Driver.<br />
<br />
Art: The visuals are fantastic.  The cybodies are colorful and seem as powerful as they are made to seem within zero space.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound is good, but what really stands out is the music.  Particularly the music when members of crux being to enter there cybodies.  Also in the earlier episodes the fish girl songs combined with the regular music score create a 5th element type sythisius of sound and music that is simply perfect.<br />
<br />
Characters: the characters are well portrayed, but they are fairly bland when all is said and done.  There is not that much development side from the initial portrayal.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: despite its serious drawbacks with the plot for a modern mecha anime, star driver is a fun, flashy show that should keep you entertained for 20 mintues.<br />
<br />

    Star Driver is a perfect example of a show that takes a simple formula and makes the resulting show wayyyy more complicated than it needs to be. The formula that I am talking about (monster of the week) is common in kids shows. Yes, kids shows! You know those shows that you loved when you were 10 but you &#039;grew out of?&#039; Well, I WOULD describe this show as sort of a teenagers version of a &#039;Monster of the week&#039;, except this show probably takes on the themes of at least 2 other shows through the time that I was watching it. For a 26

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40525">
        episode anime, this is simply too much to do in a 25 minute show in my opinion, especially since a third of the episode is taken up by a fight scene (every episode, hence Monster of the week).<br />
<br />
Another issue with this show is the characters. I could find ONE character that I liked. The rest of the characters could all just disappear and I honestly would not give a shit. I&#039;ll try to describe the characters despite this. We have the three main characters - Takuto, well I could not find anything special about his character but apparently he can summon a robot under certain conditions and uses dual swords. Then we have Sugata and Wako, who are trapped on the island that this anime is set in for various reasons. Sugata and Wako are also engaged(not really important to the main story). I don&#039;t feel like describing the rest of the characters because<br />
1. Too many characters. Way too many. <br />
2. The characters are all forgettable, partly because of 1. Except for Mizuno. Maybe it&#039;s because I actually sympathized with here and she didn&#039;t suck as much as the other characters did, including Takuto and co.<br />
<br />
Animation in this show was bright, colourful, fluid, all that jazz. However I do have an issue with the character designs. The characters all look like stick figures. It doesn&#039;t help this show&#039;s case that the main character looks more like a pussy than the smallest guy in my school. Also, I think they colour coded the character hair so that we could actually identify the characters from each other because they were so uninteresting otherwise.<br />
<br />
Music/sound in the show was nothing to complain about really. The only problem with this section is that it is never explained why the girl in the cage is singing the song before the main characters jump to that other dimension (Zero Time). To me this seems like the show is giving the song meaning for no reason at all.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know what else to say about this show. The concept of it sounded pretty cool at before I began to watch it but the series ended up being really boring because of a bunch of themes scattered all over the place and really uninteresting characters. I don&#039;t think I even got the character names right because of how uninteresting they are. Most of the characters contribute almost nothing to the story and are just there to fill time while the  main villain just goes about his business. I don&#039;t think I will ever finish watching this show because I highly doubt the ending will save it for me. I don&#039;t really have an issue with &#039;monster of the week shows&#039;, but the parts between the fighting were really boring and pointless. I think I would have just preferred an endless series of fights. <br />
<br />
To summarize, I would not recommend this show unless you really enjoy huge fighting mecha anime. You won&#039;t be thrilled at the characters/story so it would be best to just tolerate them while waiting for the inevitable clash between two huge robots. Otherwise, there are plenty of shows with cool characters that you can relate to and don&#039;t make watching a freaking show seem so much like a chore.<br />

I hope this review is helpful. <br />

    (This review will only help people how are planing or have watch this anime, and is just to help them understand the format/style of this anime series.)<br />
<br />
Okay first things first for those who have not watch this anime yet this is not your typical mecha anime series, and if you think that this may look similar to gundam and other heavy mecha anime your are wrong. I my self is victim to this why become Star Driver yes has mechs, has sexy babes but that&#039;s where everything ends. Its not bad its just the flow of the story and character interaction has not been very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31900">
        &quot;Interactive&quot;. Yes I have watch 6 episode of the series and will watch it to the end because it will be unfair to judge it this early. <br />
<br />
Good Point<br />
1. Story good enough its not your typical new guy in school meets people then meets friends fight bad guys save girl then that&#039;s it. So far The main character has to fight against his entire school (I mean it every one in his school) to protect the girl. Yes its not very original but come on the entire school population is against him and wants to kick is ass. <br />
<br />
Bad Points<br />
1. Bad flow yes its to early but in 6 episodes and still the same thing. Fight other students in mask (some are hot female students by the way ^_~) and every time he defeats one they just go by there way no revenge or friendship growth with the main character nor do they interact with the main character.<br />
<br />
This series reminds me so much of magical girls like sailor moon etc. but for the male version. Its not bad but the lack of flow early in the story is about to poor. I know its still the build up stage but six episode just fighting like magical girls with mech&#039;s is pathetic - yet original + so being balance is your chose when you watch this.<br />
<br />
Just finished it so kept my promise...<br />
Last thing is you watch it your self and judge it. So that&#039;s that hope that this helps you guys.

    This series was giving me a number of vibes connected to Code Geass and I don&#039;t mean that in a good way. Star Driver appeared to be trying to mix around the classic archetypes of super robot anime, slice-of-life high school comedy and the over-the-top elements of Code Geass. If the series ran for the most part as a comedy like Gurren Lagann where it didn&#039;t take itself seriously, then I would have found myself liking this series quite well. Instead the series tries to take itself seriously yet with the many eccentric traits of the characters, it comes across as rather awkward and hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37259">
        to take seriously just like Code Geass and is bogged down by quite a good number of issues in its plotting. Many episodes tend to run in a similar setup:<br />
<br />
1. Takuto is enjoying himself with Wako and Sugata.<br />
2. Random member of Glittering Crux in the student body meets with him or tries causing mischief.<br />
3. Member decides to challenge Takuto to Cybody battle.<br />
4. Takuto overcomes foe.<br />
5. Repeat for much of the show&#039;s run. <br />
<br />
This was quite a repetitious setup for each episode and made things appear to be mostly episodic for the show. In addition, the show doesn&#039;t really bother going into great detail into its major elements such as what led to each of the students in Glittering Crux to join the group, how Cybodies came to be, how humanity came to discover them and why the Glittering Crux did not dispose of Takuto away from Cybody battles if they desired world domination so badly. The ending also came across as rather weak with a shallow baddie unveiling himself, elements of deus ex machina and failing to provide a proper resolution to the love triangle that later develops with Takuto, Wako and Sugata.<br />
<br />
There are some elements to the plotting of Star Driver that did work well for me and kept me from dumping it much earlier on. The series does do well at fleshing out and developing the bond between Wako, Takuto and Sugata showing that the three come to greatly care for one another, even as they are aware of the complicated situation they have to overcome with the Glittering Crux and their love triangle. Marino&#039;s character arc even lays out some heart-wrenching and deep-seated issues with her that are not as apparent with her on the surface.<br />
<br />
On the visual end, Star Driver does have clean artwork delivering a decent amount of detail on mecha, character and scenery designs; as well as having its moments of fluid animation during fights between Cybodies. There are some noticeable occasions where the visual quality can drop quite a bit, particularly in some scenes during the middle and last episodes.<br />
<br />
If you could put up with and enjoy the bizarre and over-the-top developments of Code Geass, then you might be able to enjoy Star Driver more than I did. Otherwise, be prepared for a mostly mediocre romp that tries to blend together the elements I mentioned above yet comes across as hard to care for because it doesn&#039;t cover its major elements and is hard to take seriously when it tries to be so.

    Titile: Star Drive as to how I rate it.<br />
<br />
Story- Rating, a fair number 6.<br />
<br />
How I see it:<br />
<br />
  Well frist of all it looks like your classical good  vs evil kind a thing with a little bit of a &quot;Damsel in distress&quot; on the sides,but as the anime goes on a lot of the things which one might think it is, doesn&#039;t seem to be at all, one example is Sakana or the fish girl (she&#039;s an actual human, not a mermaid) you might think that she&#039;s the key to all of the things that those from the so called &quot;Glittering Curx Brigade&quot; gang

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33292">
        fears but it turns out that she&#039;s merely a nobody in the anime except a story teller to some high ranking &quot;Glittering Crux Brigade&quot; gang member. Futhermore, the story is more about a bunch of teen-agers with Cybodies and powers to manipulate the so called &quot;Zero time&quot; who do what every adrenaline filled teen-agers does, and that is DUKING OUT WITH EACH OTHER.<br />
<br />
Art-Rating, a dreadful number 2.<br />
<br />
What gives?<br />
Co&#039;z  the way the characters school uniforms, Glittering Crux Brigade members attire to the Cybodies are gay, gay and gay. Let&#039;s start with the school uniform especially the tie, it looks like an inverted penis, for the girls the tie looks like an inverted penis with balls in the sides of thier collars, 2nd the Glittering Crux Brigade&#039;s attire, nearly all of the girls dresses in an S &amp; M outfit while the guys dress in a heavy metal band. Also the Cybodies look like a poster symbol for Anorexia, which somehow how makes me think that the artist of this anime seems to be promoting it. I also hate both artist and author&#039;s concept of making the members of  Glittering Crux Brigade to wear funny looking masks that looks good when in a royal french party. <br />
<br />
Sound- Rating, a very good 8.<br />
<br />
No comment here.<br />
<br />
Character- Rating, a very good 8.<br />
<br />
I really like the roles that Takuto Tsunashi, Wako Agemaki and Sugata Shindō  play. However, it is a bit confusing as to who is the main villan of this anime. It may be possible that Sugata Shindo could be Takuto&#039;s enemy. So, I guess will find out in the end of this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall- a fair number 6. <br />
<br />
<br />
Trivia: The story of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was inspired by a real life castaway Alexander Selkirk who was strandred in an island a few miles off of Chile for 4 years.

    Everthing must come to an end, today it was Star Driver.<br />
While it was amazing at the beginning, it started slowly getting bad.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The setting itself is intruduced in a rather rushed way, but showed a lot of potential. Sadly, it went down to a &quot;which boy will Wako choose?&quot; and &quot;Takuto beats down the Kiraboshi&quot; without very much development.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I don´t have much to complain here. It was a bit too colorful in my opinion, but especially in the fighing scenes, you could see were all the graphic-work went. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The soundtrack was maybe one of the most outstanding features of the anime; the tracks themselves felt good,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35616">
        and the insert songs were a great addition. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Here it stars going downhill.<br />
Most characters hardly change from your first impression. From my point of view, exept the love-triangle centering Wako, there is almost no character development at all. Most of the female characters even fell in love with Takuto or Sugata to a certain extent, at the very least they didn´t see them as enemies anymore.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Takuto comes. Takuto fights. Takuto saves the day.<br />
That´s basicly what every episode was about.<br />
<br />
With the sole exeption of Head, most of the Kiraboshi-members somehow didn´t take their goal serious, beeing all nice to Takuto or even becoming his friends outside of the fights. Until shortly before the end, no one got at least once the idea to fight him with more than one Cybody. It seems that defeating/killing him outside of a Cybody was never an option either as well, since nobody tried even once.<br />
<br />
At the end of the story, you hardly feel like anything important happened since episode 2, because there is hardly any new plot-related information at all (ignoring a bunch of other love-relationships).<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I really liked Star Driver when it started, then it became a single sided &quot;Takuto ownez them with some new/old technique or help from Sugata&quot; - business with a featured &quot;girl in love&quot; theme. More background to everything Cybody-releated might have helped alot.

    What makes a show enjoyable? Obviously, the answer to this question will differ from person to person since not everyone has the same taste. That being said, Star Driver is easily one of the most enjoyable shows I&#039;ve watched in recent years. It&#039;s just fun and so very very FABULOUS. This show really reminded me what it&#039;s like to truly enjoy a series despite its faults and plot holes. During every fight I was rooting for Takuto and often I was on the edge of my chair in excitement. Everything from the over-the-top battles and transformation sequences to the very likable and interesting characters made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review107967">
        this show a pleasure to behold.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d like to just leave it at that and hope that my genuine enthusiasm for the show will rub off on you, but obviously to give a fair analysis and better understanding of what you&#039;re getting into I&#039;m going to break it down traditionally by story, art, sound, character, and my enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Story: The general plot can be oversimplified down to there&#039;s people who have giant trans-dimensional robots who want to fight Takuto&#039;s robot so they do and get royally owned. This in its own right (coupled with the fantastic soundtrack) can be enjoyable on its own. However, the story goes much further in many unexpected ways as we learn more and more about this bizarre &quot;Glittering Crux Brigade&quot; and what they&#039;re trying to accomplish. The general tone of the story is quite varied in how it will switch from comedy, to mech battles, to romance, and suddenly to drama and back again.<br />
Something that&#039;s very important to note about Star Driver&#039;s story is that it requires a good amount of suspension of disbelief. If you&#039;ve watched anime long enough perhaps you&#039;ve cultivated this skill. Otherwise, you might be turned off by the sheer absurdity of it. It&#039;s not the series&#039; strong point, but if you can revel in its absurdity, overlook the plot holes, and embrace the ridiculous outfits: you&#039;ll find a good story with excellent pacing that is neither too slow or fast. (7/10)<br />
<br />
Art: The art of Star Driver is beautiful, unique, and often fluid. This is what first grabbed my attention when I looked into this series. When they&#039;re not in &quot;Zero Time&quot; the background art of this island looks like paradise and is very pleasing to the eye. When they jump into &quot;Zero Time&quot; and start the mech battles, everything gets dialed up to 11. The Mechs look absolutely fantastic while also being hand-drawn. The scenery in &quot;Zero Time&quot; is space-themed and is so beautiful that it&#039;s hard not for it to take your breath away. Check out a battle on youtube if you&#039;re not convinced.<br />
The character animation is done by Bones and as a fan of their previous works like Darker Than Black I was very pleased with the results. Putting a number rating on something so inherently subjective is rather pointless, but I thoroughly enjoyed the art and animation and thus I feel that it deserves special recognition. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Sound: YOU ARE MY ONLY SHOOTING STAAAAAR!~<br />
I feel that the soundtrack is easily the highlight of this show. I loved both OPs and both EDs and thought that every piece of the OST was used appropriately to enhance the intended mood. Each of the Four Maidens has her own theme that is played at the start of each battle and I thought that they were all catchy and a pleasure to hear. The songs &quot;Cross Over&quot; and &quot;Shining Star&quot; by 9nine were especially catchy and used as ED 1 and OP 2 respectively. It&#039;s a soundtrack that you will notice, but at the same time it doesn&#039;t detract from the scene it&#039;s supporting.<br />
With regards to sound effects and voice acting, both are superb. The sound effects during the battles are cool and fit nicely, and the voice actors all fit their roles spot-on. Miyano Mamoru did an especially good job as Takuto with his hilarious engrish and epic battle cries.  <br />
Overall, the fact that I still listen to parts of the OST daily is a strong sign to me that this show has an outstanding sound. (10/10)<br />
<br />
Character: The general impression I had of the cast was that they were all unique and likable with very few exceptions. Furthermore, all of the cast feels very real and human. Takuto&#039;s inspiring and bright personality is well contrasted with Sugata&#039;s more stoic yet kind demeanor. What was especially impressive is the attention the show gives to properly fleshing-out minor characters. I&#039;ve always been impressed with shows that can manage a large cast of characters well, and Star Driver is certainly one of them.<br />
I can&#039;t be too analytical of the characters without spoiling plot developments, but what I will say is that each character&#039;s personality is unique and their interactions are interesting to observe. (9/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: My personal opinion is that the most important part of any show is how much I enjoyed it. Honestly, Star Driver is one of those shows that you just really enjoy without knowing particularly why. Maybe it was how awesome Takuto was as he skillfully defeated his foes? Maybe it was his ridiculous transformation sequence and catch phrases? Maybe it was the Glittering Crux Brigade and how fabulous they were? Or maybe it was all of it?<br />
As I&#039;ve said before, I enjoyed the hell out of this show. It evoked excitement, put a smile on my face, and made me eager to watch more. (10/10)<br />
<br />
So, overall, what do ratings mean anyway? Who cares about the plot holes? This is the kind of show that you should watch with a group of friends as you all get behind Takuto and his fabulous quest and do the KIRABOSHI!~ pose. Don&#039;t take it too seriously and enjoy the FABULOUS ride that is Star Driver. <br />
<br />
End note: Please keep in mind that my rating system isn&#039;t the same as everyone else&#039;s and what is a 9 for me might not be a 9 for you.

    Star Driver is a confusing story of a bunch of kids trying to take over the world. Well, in essence. This show literally can take anything and throw it at you. Sometimes this works, and sometimes… well it doesn’t. The less critical you are of every little detail the more and more enjoyable it can be.<br />
<br />
The story takes place on a small island with a big secret. There exist giant robots that are sealed away by the maidens of the island. The Glittering Crux desires to release these upon the world. As the seals are broken they come closer and closer to being released into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38038">
        the real world. However, it is up to the Takuto to dazzle the stage and prevent them from breaking free from the dimension they inhabit! Again and again he fights them off like a true hero! While this is all fine and good and he is quite dazzling… the combat becomes quite repetitive. Sure each Cybody, robot, is unique and has its own gimmick but the fights all feel the same. There is no feeling of urgency as you see Takuto kick ass without any scratches every time. Thankfully if you brave it out the final battles are more unique, interesting, and well, closer to the quality of something that those people can say is “BONES quality action.” That said if I had to grade solely on the episodic action segment it would be pretty bad. However, the stuff taking place outside of Zero Time, the dimension cybodies are sealed in, is a lot more enjoyable. <br />
<br />
The characters in Star Driver cover every archetype out there. We have the rich ojou who lives on a huge boat and has two servants one of the few I have ever liked, the studious serious mysterious class representative, and a free spirited girl who believes in magic. As a matter of fact, the female lead is one of the least interesting and unique one that comes to mind. She is, however, the maiden which Takuto and Sugata fight to protect. Takuto is very admirable, kind, and the way he enters the battle saying &quot;Dazzling the stage, galactic pretty boy&quot; pretty much sums up how he does everything. Sugata is very serious and always looking out for Wako. He is also very quiet and doesn&#039;t like to be upfront about what he does.  Each and every one of the characters have something about them that will leave an impression on you at one point. If there is one thing Star Driver does right, it is weaving in episodes for each character. Unfortunately I will not elaborate on the characters more because the bulk of what is interesting about the show is finding out who they are.<br />
<br />
Yes, through the first chunk of episodes they introduce all the characters of the story. Depending on if you like said character the episode can be a hit or miss. The ‘good guys’ consisting of the mains interact through these supporting roles in order to show us each side of the story. By each side I imply that these others are always somehow involved with the cybodies on the island. They don’t go to great lengths to hide their identities, at least to the viewers. The Glittering Crux only wear masks, and when you’re the only person with that hair color AND that seiyuu it is sort of hard to not make the connection. <br />
<br />
The romance in this ends up sucking for something original and not ongoing. There is not much progress in this although Wako spends all of her time uselessly fawning over our male leads. There are a few good moments but in sort, do not hope for much here.<br />
<br />
One of the interesting things is the parallelism they make between the story of the characters and the that of which is told behind the scenes by Sakana of &quot;Sam the Squid Piercer.&quot; It tries to put an artistic or descriptive background on what I was watching and was just one of the many little things that I found interesting. Another little repetitive quirk: The animation scene is the same every time zero time is activated and people board their cybody. The sequence takes a good minute at least, and the same (awesome imo) insert is played for it, switching once half way through. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is one thing that can&#039;t really be described - Star Driver somehow gets you pumped up. The battles aren&#039;t stunning, the story takes a while to kick in, but there is just something that makes you want to say &#039;this is pretty awesome!&#039; every time you click the play button. So as a disclaimer; If you don&#039;t get pumped up at all in the first episode it definitely won&#039;t happen at all. If you lose this after episode one feeling by sticking it out a bit longer till episode 6 or 9 for two good arcs. From there it only gets better.<br />

    im not gonna give some review breaking it down cause you know what theres no point, this show doesnt try to be anything, it rarley gets seirous, parodies itself almsot every second, and is just tries to do one thing and one thing only, be fun, and it succeeds, the show isnt gonna get you emmotionaly attached or make you laugh your ass off, its merly going to take you on a awsome trip of WTF moments, the shows over the top, has no plot, bt still has development in the charecters, the show is legitimently funney at times, but when it coems down to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37854">
        it this show is just fun<br />
<br />
thats all you need to know, i know people are cautious about 10&#039;s given out like this that ignore obvious flaws but should it really matter, this is one of the most enjoyable shows ive ever seen, i just sit back anbd have fun with it, and really what more do you want, iude rather watch this show thats fully aware of all its flaws and laughed at them and just goes off to have a fun ride instead of watching a show that tries too hard to be gripping and ends up with just being a drag.<br />
<br />
so ill just say this and end this review, if you want a fun show that laughs at its own flaws and has fun with it while still having some good serious moments when it needs to get serious, just kick back and watch one fabulous episode of star driver cause their wont ever be another show like this, enjoy it for what it is, not what it could have been,

    In a boring world, there are youngsters who seek thrills while having their spirit be their guide. And what could be better than swimming to an Island infested with a evil organization destined to destroy the world, in order to find the fabulous school-life while being a &quot;GINGA BISHOUNEN&quot;? Welcome to the world of Star Driver: Takuto of Radiance, a glorious anime filled with thrills and school drama. But let&#039;s not forget the giant robots that fight for their goals, which will prevail, Good or Evil? Ladies and Gentlemen, let&#039;s not waste more time and jump right in!<br />
<br />
I will put my review into these categories;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196537">
        Overview, Story, Characters, Sound and Animation, and my overall enjoyment which serves as a conclusion!<br />
<br />
The overview:<br />
<br />
The Story takes place on a Island somewhere in Japan, location unknown, where we follow in the footsteps of our prettyboy and real main character Tsunashi Takuto, in his search for his father and nothing more than the thrill of being young and adventours. What seemed to be a regular Island contains a dark past, where an organization known as The Glittering Crux has evil plans to break an ancient seal, in order to bring the sealed Mechs called Cybodies into the realm of living. The seal is contained within four maidens of the Island chosen by bloodline in order to defend the seal and prevent it from breaking. <br />
<br />
While the Glittering Crux is successful in breaking the first maidens seal, the others are well protected by our Hero, the one and only; Tsunashi Takuto and his newfound secret Cybody which he inherited; The Legendary Cybody, TAUBURN. Tsunashi is no one else than a &quot;Ginga Bishounen&quot;, A Legendary Hero and savior. From this point we follow him through his school-life with his friends Wako, which is a maiden, and Sugata, where Takuto-kun from time to time, has to save Wako from her seal being broken by the evil organization in epic battles for survival.<br />
<br />
The Story:<br />
<br />
What&#039;s particularly interesting in this anime is the story, as it is really paper thin, but brings in alot of enjoyment and some big twists here and there to keep you seated and longing to watch more. The story is told in a beautiful way where we follow Takuto through his everyday life after coming to the Island where he meets different people and does a lot of things a normal, yet popular guy would do, like joining the drama club, yes popular kids in Japan do these things. But the story really takes on its climax where near the end of each episode, Takuto will have to fight different members of the Glittering Crux in order to defend the maids&#039; seals, using different techniques and different abilities in order to prevail. The Story is quite linear and brings an interesting aspect of both school-life and what it would mean to be a Legendary Hero, &quot;Ginga Bishounen&quot;(Galactic Pretty boy). As mentioned before it is paper thin, as the real plot and real reason behind why Crux does what it does, will not be revealed until the end of the series. As the fights are astonishing, they are the only way to keep the plot developing further, where as the school-life is  just kind of a filler for the relationship building between our three main characters. Which is sad, i wished that the significance of what happened at school would be well, more significant. But the Enjoyment is there, and the reason I keep coming back is because it manages to pull out the kind of two lives that Takuto live, the way the story goes from School to Mech epicness keeps you sitting in your seat wanting more for each episode. And this is the reason why the story is so great, it captivates you by being nearly invisible, the story is basically the life of a teenager gone Super Hero, and it fits this anime to the stone. 7/10<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
<br />
The Characters on the other hand are not really that much developed. And are pretty much just regular teenagers, but with the exception of cool looking hairstyles. All of them have a back-story and a past which at some point get revealed and works as a reminder of why they are, who they are right now. But as the most fascinating thing in this story is how the characters interact with each other, which is basically 1/3 of what the anime is about. Not much of character development going on except for Takuto, which has to grow when he finds out that there are a lot more pressure and responsibility on his shoulders than he initially had thought. As far as the interaction between each character goes, each character has his/her own way of doing things and this kind of becomes a testament for how they are as people. Also on a side note many of the Glittering Crux members also have a past which you get to see, because there are a lot more to them than just evil villains, they have their own reasons for doing their deeds. The Characters have some love relations going on between them which also forces out some of the truth they are trying to conceal and not show to others, this brings in more aspects to what&#039;s fascinating about the animes characters. 8/10<br />
<br />
Sound and Animation:<br />
<br />
I am a man who is really concerned with the animation and soundtrack of an anime as it may make or break and anime for me. And let me tell you this straight out, bleh.... this anime hits STRAIGHT A&#039;S IN BOTH CATEGORIES. Almost had you there! But dear reader, this anime excels in this category straight out. The wonderfully detailed characters and the use of bright colors, everything is just perfect, the way the robots/mechs fits the characters and how they also made them resemble their users is astonishing. The fights are amazing, the shading and the weaponry are also pretty darn cool. So animation is top notch, and the soundtrack really tingled my senses in a good way. The music fit the animation like no other, like the song &quot;Monochrome&quot; which is used right before the summoning of the mechs gives you straight out Goosebumps. The song when Takuto destroys and enemy mech, it gives you the sensation of being there and that you actually won something. The OST is filled with many songs like these and are exactly fit for the situations they are used in, and the beutiful orchestrated music is straight out godly! 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
This Anime is not something you watch for the plot, so if you are looking for something really plot heavy and something that goes deeper than meets the eye, this is not exactly the anime to serve those needs. But this an anime you sit to on a Saturday just for satisfaction, it has cool characters and huge mech fights, what more could we need? What&#039;s interesting is that even if the plot is short to nonexistent it is still pleasant to watch the interactions between characters and how at night Takuto gets to fight big as mechs with his ultra overpowered legendary one. So the strong sides is the way story gets told, from a slice of life point and from the action superhero point. Unfortunately this seems to be good blend actually, it fits each other to some extent that it&#039;s actually becoming entertaining. And this show is all about flashy colors, big mechs and overall enjoyment with the removing of the heavy and deep plot. So overall, a great soundtrack, a story and animation which fits the genre, amazing fights and a really entertaining day- school life sets this anime at a strong  8/10 for pure enjoyment. <br />
<br />
Hope you guys enjoyed this review, if you did please give at thumbs up, and enjoy your day!<br />

    WARNING SPOILERS OF A SHORT REVIEW (NOT REALLY JUST EXPRESSING MY OPINION) <br />
<br />
i mean seriously, i watched this off a hunch from a bit i saw on youutube, was expecting a parodic mecha anime of some sorts, but after ep 25 credits rolled i just stood up, turned 360 degrees and left. the characters, go literally nowhere, there is no backstory. the battle scenes are just the same thing. there is no implied shipping or room for any shipping, all the characters are petty and not to mention, the transformation scene, is the same EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.

    A first sigh the history isn&#039;t that original, but it&#039;s good an enjoyable, mix that with a GREAT animation a Music, a few cool figths and done, you have a great anime!<br />
<br />
It was funny, specially the silliness of some characters, but that part was a little to simple... I hope the story evolves to something great but, with just the 1st cap, I can&#039;t say mush aboutt it.

    Story:  4/10<br />
The story is simple and not very new or fresh. They add some sci-fi elements into it but it does not take it far. The story is not good and boring.<br />
<br />
Art:  10/10<br />
This studio does some gorgeous animations, action and art but with poor character development and a bad story the art can only take you so far.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The sound is great and the music is catchy and appealing. Very good job in this aspect.<br />
<br />
Characters: 6/10<br />
Some are interesting but others are just so bland that you will not care enough to know their names. There are maybe three to five people you will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35645">
        memorize but that is it. Their back story and reasoning are barely explained.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
It was enjoyable to watch some girl and boy shy scenes and the fight scenes but other than that it was not enjoyable to hear anyone talk about things that really did not matter for example one girl asks the main character do you want to kiss me through the glass? Who cares?<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
You should watch it and just skip forward to the action scenes where they fight, kiss or have shy lovey lovey scenes. The story is very very poorly explained and the characters are forgettable.<br />
<br />
