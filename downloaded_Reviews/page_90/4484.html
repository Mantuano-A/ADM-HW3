    *No Spoiler Concise Review*<br />
TL;DR: An idiot girl getting into endless shenanigans that keeps viewers just laughing till their precious buttocks fall off.<br />
[Story: 4/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 9/10]<br />
<br />
What is Aho Girl? What isn&#039;t Aho girl? Should I even watch this anime? If you think this anime looks stupid and the premise you&#039;ve read on MAL sounds dumb then you are even more of an &quot;Aho&quot; than the main girl is in this anime. Seriously, Aho Girl (Idiot Girl) is your classic boke and tsukkomi style comedy with plenty of slapstick. If you just want to turn off your brain and laugh

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258022">
        your ass off, this is definitely that show. I have never seen so much savagery in anime. The brutality is absolutely barbaric. It&#039;s just gag after gag after gag. One of the best 15 minute ab workout ever. Your sides will hate you but they will thank you. <br />
<br />
This is your classic yin-yang sort of anime where the characters and the story directly compliments each other. One can&#039;t live without the other. Though there are numerous characters introduced as the anime goes on, the main characters are, Yoshiko, a masochist idiot beyond all belief, and her childhood crush A-Kun, a genius sadist beyond all belief. Every time Yoshiko&#039;s idiosyncrasies rises to a peak, A-Kun brutally punches it down to normalize the situation. It is this exchange of quit pro quo that makes this anime so hilarious.  Even though viewers might feel bad for Yoshiko because of all the sufferings she endures due to her stupidity. However, she&#039;s literally the anthropomorphized genderbent version of Patrick Star. Not to mention she deserves every bit of it. <br />
<br />
Each episode consists of few short gags. Even though you know it will feature some sort of idiotic stunt from the MC, needless to say, each gag remains fresh despite reusing running joke here and there. As the show goes on, we are introduced to various side characters ranging from Yandere Killer Mom to Tsundere Lewd President to Kuudere Dumb Sister to Overtly Charismatic Doge. At first they appear smart however as the show goes everyone but A-kun slowly becomes an idiot. There&#039;s a popular fan theory from avid manga readers that it&#039;s all A-Kun&#039;s fault. He sucks the intelligence out of everyone around him. He has like a 20 foot radius that sucks away at least 50 points of intelligence from everyone who enters. True or False, well that&#039;s for you to decide. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the art &amp; animation in this anime is pretty good. The studio did great justice to this anime despite it being an anime short. It&#039;s beautifully hand drawn and all the characters somehow stand out from one another. Not just the character design, the seiyuus in this anime heightened the enjoyment factor even more. Specifically the seiyuu of Yoshiko. She did a fantastic job. The OP and ED songs are funny and compliments the comedy style of this anime. The background score didn&#039;t stand out much but that can be overlooked.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you are looking for a short anime with endless comedy gags with no clear story or plot but just laughter, then this anime is for you. It&#039;s slightly lewd, slightly dramatic but over the top comedy. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how great your abs look from all that laughter. <br />
<br />
Btw, did you know that &quot;Baka&quot; and &quot;Aho&quot; are synonyms. People who live in the eastern half of central Japan (Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba) generally use Aho whilst rarely using Baka when serious. This is reversed in the western half of Japan, (Osaka, Kyoto,) resulting in some minor arguments between Tomins (Capital Citizens) and Osakans.<br />
<br />
P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!<br />

    Hidden beneath the antics, the one-liners, and the pop culture references, Aho Girl’s goal is obvious even to the untrained eye; it desires your attention. “Look at me! Look at me!” Aho Girl screams, waving its arms and jumping about in a frenzied, excessive, and desperate manner. In doing so, this show has managed to not only work but endear itself to the audience as well. Quite a few seasonal viewers have been smitten over this show and, at first glance, it’s easy to see why. Aho Girl is energetic. It’s straightforward. And it’s occasionally charming. However, Aho Girl is also painful to watch.<br />
<br />
First and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258024">
        foremost, this show is simply not funny. For Aho Girl, which largely subdues its aesthetics in an effort to emphasize its writing, this is a severely damaging flaw. Aho Girl fancies itself an extravagant comic extraordinaire yet it never fully ventures into the absurd; it’s as if Aho Girl is frightened of abandoning its slice-of-life roots and as a result is rather hesitant of displaying signs of vivaciousness. The instances where its comic genius sparks to life are memorable in their own right (the homage to the Power Rangers, in particular) but they are few and far between. It hardly helps that Aho Girl, like most mediocre comedies, is obsessed with explaining the jokes to you; with every act of mischief, there’s not only a character (read: the “self-insert”) elaborating on the details of said act but there are also occasional cues from Aho Girl itself that tell you how the act was intended to be funny. As this show can attest to, even comedies can be guilty of infodumping.<br />
<br />
From the first episode, Aho Girl is engaged in a war against common sense. This is a show that prides itself in its intentional stupidity; for Aho Girl, lapses in judgment and instances of in-the-moment logic are par for the course. A carefree attitude and general acts of silliness are a major source of this show’s appeal. That said, Aho Girl underwhelms when it attempts a serious approach; it’s as if the show doesn’t understand its audience. Most viewers appreciate Aho Girl because of its slapstick humor, because of the amusing eyecatches, because of its short runtime and, yes, because of the fanservice. I doubt that these viewers picked up Aho Girl for the half-baked, insipid, and monotonous moments of insight that ultimately result in little but wasted time. These moments of insight are not only executed poorly but their suitability is subpar; Aho Girl tends to observe the most trivial matters, like a low score on a quiz, and overexert itself when it should be focusing on the more important problems, like the abusive relationship at the center of it all.<br />
<br />
Every problem that arises from Aho Girl stems from the disastrous dynamic between its protagonists; it’s the repugnant elephant in the room that Aho Girl’s fanbase has condoned, glossed over, neglected, and outright ignored at times. The cast members are defined by a single trait but no cast member has as damaging a trait as Akuru Akutsu (the “self-insert”) and Yoshiko Hanabatake (the show’s poster girl). Yoshiko’s defining trait is idiocy while Akuru’s is anger; while Yoshiko compensates for her lack of intellect with a can-do attitude, Akuru offers little outside of his constant rage. There have been plenty of characters similar to Akuru, like Last Exile’s Alex Row, that have provided substance, versatility and growth to their cast beyond their brooding tendencies and hair-trigger temper. Akuru, however, is feeble in comparison; he makes little effort to express himself beyond screaming matches and physical abuse. When he encounters a problem, Akuru explodes. When his friend attempt helping him, Akuru becomes spiteful; he insults, he torments, he belittles, he punches, he kicks, and he hurls expletives at his friends simply because he perceives them as annoying. Sure, Akuru apologizes once in a while but he never bothers to change. Honestly, why should he? The other cast members, specifically Yoshiko, and Aho Girl itself by proxy have long since accepted this as rational behavior. That the show has treated Akuru’s abusive tendencies as a gimmick, that the show’s fanbase has little reaction to it, is sickening to me.<br />
<br />
There is a place in this world for Aho Girl, where it can exist without scrutiny of any sort. Aho Girl has established itself and thrived in GIFs, in Vines, in reaction videos, in memes and in the Weird Side of YouTube. It is there that Aho Girl’s positive traits can flourish. However, under any sort of analysis, Aho Girl not only leaves you unsatisfied but more than a little repulsed as well. This show, allergic to depth and disgusted by morality, is at best mildly amusing and at worst one of the biggest disgraces of a thoroughly mediocre season. Aho Girl makes a spectacle of itself -  presenting faux-meaningful observations; idolizing its vapid female lead; overindulging in panty shots; deploying one tired, overused cliché after another (the sister complex, among others); and fishing for attention - while accomplishing absolutely nothing in the end. While its peers in the comedy genre have pushed boundaries, expanded horizons, enlightened its fans, and revolutionized the medium, Aho Girl has contributed little beyond munching on bananas.

    Oh boy.. Summer 2017 animes are ending already and it was quite a hustle... From the isekai genre shows like &#039;&#039;In Another World With My Smartphone&#039;&#039; that so many hates about,<br />
,the A-1 pictures version of the Fate series, the gambling-crazy anime Kakegurui, the action packed 2nd season of Boku No Hero Academia, to the romantic anime Koi To Uso, we all have been blessed with so many good shows though there is something missing.. An anime that is mainly focused on humor, laughter or should I say.. The legendary &#039;&#039;Comedy&#039;&#039; genre. There comes the hidden wonder &#039;&#039;Aho Girl&#039;&#039;. It looks like an anime version of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258041">
        &#039;&#039;Minions&#039;&#039; but focused mostly on the daily high school life of our beloved banana-loving girl Hanabatake Yoshiko and her childhood love but a brutal wrestler who can supplex her everyday because of her stupidity, Akutsu Akuru or simply, A-kun.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
On my opinion, I prefer stories that goes with the intro, rising, climax, falling then resolution. Thats whats lacking Aho Girl.. Though this anime gives us &#039;&#039;part&#039;&#039; where it has almost all the elements of a perfect plot, though I said &#039;&#039;Almost&#039;&#039;. Not everytime. The comedic side though is very superior on this anime which balance the enjoyment of the audience.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art of this anime... The characters sketches are easily aliked to any other animes out there but the action-packed art scenes/effects and the mouth along with the eyes of the characters makes it unique and entertaining. Comedic + Good Art = Worth it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
Hey hey.. They said the opening of the anime is not that good. I&#039;m like &#039;&#039;Am I the only one who loves it?&#039;&#039;. Along with the humor side of the opening, its music is preferable to the anime itself to be honest. Then comes the little background music when the shows rolls on stating that this anime will be a high school/laughable anime...<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
This anime shows us that even characters that are hard to read like A-kun can be an element to a joke or humor and they did it perfectly along with other characters. All of the characters have their roles on the line from Main to Supporting, which supports the show even more on its genre.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
9/10 is already pretty high for me. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. A 12-minute anime like Aho Girl, for me, its like already 24 minutes (but I&#039;m begging for more Lmao).<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
If theres 9.5/10 I could really give this anime that rating. Enjoyable, funny, great art, excellent characters, wrestling supplexes, everything here is almost perfect and I love this show very much.

    This time: Aho Girl! Review!<br />
<br />
12 episodes, each is around 12 minutes. Each episode is split into 3 or 4 smaller parts.<br />
Now, Aho Girl doesn&#039;t have any story, it contains random unrelated stories which are funny with different characters from the cast.<br />
<br />
It was pretty funny at the beginning, and I even wanted full 24 minutes episodes, but..... Somewhere in the middle I felt like I&#039;m already done with Aho Girl. It became a lot less funny, and many of the jokes repeated themselves.<br />
<br />
At one point new characters were introduced, and which felt to me too much. I liked the original cast and now that half of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258026">
        the scenes are focused on Yoshiko and other random characters. <br />
<br />
The concept of Aho Girl is simple- Yoshiko, the main character, is stupid (Well, &quot;Aho&quot;) and does nothing but play around. She doesnt study and doesnt even care about it. She thinks everybody loves her and basically... she acts like a 4 years old girl. <br />
<br />
And yea it was funny at first, but then again, it just becomes repetitive.<br />
<br />
If I were to take all the stories together and give them a score, 5/10 would fit.<br />
<br />
Art-7/10 as nothing too special, but it wasn&#039;t unappealing.<br />
<br />
Sound 3/10. Nothing worth remembering, neither the OP or the OST (if there even was one)<br />
<br />
Character- 7/10<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;ve already described Yoshiko, but all the characters repeat the same pattern. While they are pretty funny in the beginning (because you have yet to see they follow the same pattern over and over again). <br />
<br />
You already know the pattern from episode one (or the first episode every character is introduced).<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll confess, because there aren&#039;t any character complexity  nor development, nor story, I can&#039;t really say much about this anime. You can try it, as it was funny at the beginning, but... Don&#039;t hope too much. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment+Overall: 7/10. Thank you for your time.

    Sometimes, silly actions can make us laugh, stupid comments are hilarious, unexplained decisions are funny, but it isn&#039;t the case of Aho Girl. I wonder if the author respects women or not. <br />
<br />
The story, a stupid girl Yoshiko with a brain of the size of a monkey that has some attention disorder illness. She takes stupid decisions all the time and tries to capture the &quot;love&quot; and interest of Akutsu. Also, she likes bananas, so the author refers to her as a monkey.  She has been near Akutsu since their youth, but this guy incomprehensibly hates her. Honestly, ¿isn&#039;t that fun?  We will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255297">
        laugh in some scenes, I can&#039;t deny that some of them are funny but others no. Is like seeing a mentally ill person doing any stupid thing and someone will punch that person, and we end laughing for that actions. <br />
<br />
It isn&#039;t funny seeing a guy beating a woman all the time, he hits Yoshiko, insults her, minimizes her and even compares her to a piece of filth. And that doesn&#039;t end there he does similar actions to her mom, Yoshie that is desperate to give her daughter to the first person that appears nearby, in this case, Akutsu. It isn&#039;t funny seeing a progression like this. It will be funnier if Akutsu tries helping the poor soul of Yoshiko by all means in a similar case as with his sister and ends failing. <br />
<br />
About the characters, what can I say? It is a monkey as described in the show (Yoshiko) vs. and orangutan (that arrogant guy one). The other characters are forced, like Yoshiko&#039;s friends and appear in a very useless way. To add some competition for her, the author just added another female from her school that falls in love for Akutsu. <br />
<br />
Update recent episodes:  In the last episodes, I noticed that if you remove Akutsu from the story, the show will go from bad to abysmal. The story failed entirely in being a balanced and real comedy. The show can&#039;t make people laugh without the abusive orangutan around. <br />
<br />
The voice over, ¿what happened Aoi? You are better than this. Honestly, she isn&#039;t the voice for Yoshiko. The character needs to yell too much, and she ends doing a pinch that gets annoying because she uses a high pinch and can&#039;t maintain it regularly so ends pushing harder and the tone isn&#039;t balanced.<br />
<br />
About the art, it is normal. We aren&#039;t seeing any master piece here, but your eyes aren&#039;t going to suffer from it either.  The songs are good. The OP has a good rhythm. The sound, in general, is acceptable. <br />
 <br />
Finally, I am sure that a lot of persons will love this kind of shows and I can&#039;t argue with them. I am neutral and will end watching it because I am hoping that Akutsu will change his actions or that Yoshiko could hit this orangutan.<br />

    Every once in a while, there is that anime that you just keep watching without knowing why you are doing it but you&#039;re still enjoying it so much and Aho Girl is just like that for me. I started the anime out reluctant to do it as I felt it was going to be stupid and mediocre but I sure was wrong.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
The story is nothing special. The story follows Yoshiko, a girl extremely stupid you&#039;ll feel stupid yourself just watching her, and her every day life with her childhood friend, A-kun. She is always doing something stupid and he is always trying to stop

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253772">
        her. She also adds suffering to the life of the rest of her friends.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
The art is normal for an anime like it. I can see them making the most out of their budget, though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The opening theme is somewhat catchy. There isn&#039;t much to say about the sound considering most of the background music is like something you&#039;d find in Youtube video about comedy.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
All characters are cliched in their personality but they are extreme in it. Yoshiko is a free-spirited, stupid girl but taking it to the extreme. A-kun is the aggressive character that&#039;s forced to put up with the stupidity of Yoshiko but he is missing a machine gun.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I haven&#039;t laughed as hard since Konosuba. This anime is pretty hilarious and would just make you laugh pretty much the whole time. As always, comedy as subjective so what I might be laughing at, another person might find unfunny. It&#039;s all a matter of preferences and personality.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Aho Girl isn&#039;t some kind of perfect anime that has great narrative, interesting story, deep characters, breathtaking art, or best soundtrack in history but it is something you watch when you&#039;re free an wanna have a good laugh. I&#039;d recommend it to any comedy fans and just casuals that wanna try something funny. It should NOT be taken seriously or you might not enjoy it at all. Overall, you just need to pause your brain for the 12 minutes in every episodes and enjoy it no matter how weird it seemed.

    Aho Girl is a comedy anime that I would recommend for anyone wanting to enjoy a good laugh.<br />
<br />
The series revolves around the lives of a complete airhead of a girl named Yoshiko(who loves bananas) and her friend and acclaimed crush Akuru who is a smart and dilligent friend. Akaru has a hard time keeping the Aho on reigns during every passing moment!<br />
<br />
This is a short series with each episode being only 12 minutes long and following no specific plot; however, I do not mind as each episode is enjoyable to watch and each character stands out.<br />
<br />
The sound is very good when it comes to voices

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253754">
        and reactions.<br />
<br />
The art is crisp and while it isn&#039;t the most detailed or colour contrasted, its simplicity and porportions is exactly what you would want from a comedy anime.<br />
<br />
Great comedy! I recommend you enjoy each episode while it lasts!<br />

    Have you ever looked at an anime you&#039;re planning to watch and think, &quot;Man, this is gonna be bad, isn&#039;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was my initial impression of Aho Girl. But BOY was I surprised.<br />
<br />
Aho Girl is probably the only anime I&#039;ve seen of it&#039;s kind, where the girl gets beat up by the support character instead of a dude.<br />
<br />
Not just lightly bonked like in a cute way either, she gets FUCKING SUPLEX SLAMMED INTO THE FLOOR.<br />
<br />
Aho Girl represents the standard for physical comedy in anime for me. It&#039;s very easy to pick a male comedic relief character and have the straightman girl bash him up for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335717">
        no reason to garner cheap laughs. The way this anime differentiates itself, is by making it so that almost every smacking she receives is justified and appropriate.<br />
<br />
One of the things that stood out to me was the character design. Yoshiko, or the Aho Girl&#039;s design is made in such a way that it&#039;s quite difficult to look at her sexually or treat her as this innocent fragile flower that most female characters in anime are usually treated like. <br />
<br />
Not only does it make it easy to swallow the fact that she gets absolutely shitmixed by Akuru almost daily,this also makes it easier to see her as this absolute idiot that somehow transcends her medium and annoys the viewer as well, which is amazingly remarkable. <br />
<br />
The VA for Aho Girl, Aoi Yuuki did an AMAZING job in giving her a voice that&#039;s just the right amount of annoying to get the point across, while still keeping it bearable to watch. Her voice, while being annoying, is very suited to Yoshiko&#039;s personality, which makes it easier to digest her stupidity.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, because of the near perfect character of Aho Girl, all other characters, with the exception of Akuru, were not explored enough. This is especially true in the case of Sayaka, who got so little screentime, that Yoshiko&#039;s dog was more prominent in the anime than her. While it doesn&#039;t really affect the anime as much, that was just my personal wish.<br />
<br />
The intro gag is pretty funny, not gonna lie. It makes it worth it to stick around to see it on every episode. It&#039;s little things like that that elevate this anime to such an enjoyable experience overall.<br />
<br />
Since this is a gag anime, things like story and character development are barely needed. This anime definitely doesn&#039;t have any of them, but it does the one thing a gag anime is supposed to do VERY well.<br />
<br />
That is, this anime is FUCKING HILARIOUS. Not only because of Aho Girl&#039;s antics, but the supporting cast is also very funny in their own right. Somehow, everytime Aho Girl get smacked into orbit, it makes me burst into laughter. It took me a while to get used to it.<br />
<br />
Other than physical comedy, the thought process jokes and other jokes landed very well for me. Every episode managed to get me, despite the fact that I could feel my brain slowly being rubbed smooth.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is regarded pretty well by the community, and it&#039;s easy to see why. This anime knows exactly what it wants to be, which is a gag anime that&#039;s actually funny. It absolutely nails it.<br />
<br />
I definitely recommend this anime. Sure, your brain might feel numb after watching it, but it&#039;s definitely worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />

    Aho Girl is about as &quot;industry low standard&quot; as you can find. Following the &quot;slice of life&quot; adventures of a girl who is completely non-functional as a human being (and the small cast who spend all their time reacting to her strange antics), Aho-Girl lives up to its very simple name, &quot;Idiot Girl&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is no story to speak of, just several short sketches in a 10 minute episode (12 with the opening). The situations are intended to be comedy, but relies almost exclusively on low grade slap stick. Despite not being an &quot;ero&quot; anime, there is not a small amount of panty shots in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256743">
        series, but everything is played for laughs.<br />
<br />
The animation is distracting in how cheap it is, making heavy use of background effects and action lines to create the illusion of movement. <br />
<br />
As mentioned, the episodes are 10 minutes a piece and they&#039;re basically all the same. If you&#039;re a fan of easy comedy and slapstick you might get a chuckle but ultimately you won&#039;t miss out skipping this series.

    Aho Girl is a slapstick slice of life that revolves around a stupid (aho) girl Hanabatake Yoshiko and her more-normal neighbour/classmate/crush Akutsu Akuru. I decided to watch this one day as I was browsing idly for new anime. Boy, I discovered a gold mine!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s fun to watch in every episode so far and I&#039;ve never failed to laugh in every one of them (the episode on Power Rangers was brilliant!). It&#039;s silly to the point it&#039;s genius like Mr. Bean.<br />
<br />
SJWs might find this distasteful as Akuru always hit Yoshiko whenever she pisses him off (most were quiet and find it funny when a female tsundere

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256165">
        hits a guy, though). I find this rather refreshing since it&#039;s rare to see such reverse. Not that I condone violence against any of the TWO genders, but hey, it&#039;s a comedy anime with exaggerated humour.<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve always mentioned in my other reviews, I&#039;m very generous when it comes to graphics and artwork but this anime has both beautiful animation and humour. It&#039;s a complete package for me and I hope you&#039;d be tempted to watch it too if you haven&#039;t.

    Does this anime have any type of creative nuance or depth that would generally warrant a high rating? No.<br />
<br />
Does it create a lasting imprint on its audience, or contain any theme that teaches something of value? Also no. There&#039;s no real story to speak of, the music is decent but nowhere near amazing, and the characters fall into various general tropes that you&#039;ve probably seen a thousand times.<br />
<br />
All of this, yet I think this anime deserves an 8? Yup.<br />
<br />
Aho Girl is the very definition of lowbrow humour; the greasy potato wedges, the barbecue pulled pork of anime. There is nothing refined present, but it throws

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323028">
        countless gags toward you that are so absurd, idiotic, and unrealistic that you can&#039;t help but laugh at the intrusive slapstick it provides. This makes it a forgettable yet oddly entertaining comedy in its own right. <br />
<br />
If irrational slapstick humour that edges upon being barbaric is your type of thing, grab a bit of your favourite comfort food before you dive in; you&#039;re bound to have a comically good time.

    Going bonkers over bananas.<br />
<br />
This is a weird series, more of a series of 4 small episodes every main one, but they are just long enough to be entertaining, any longer and they might be too much.<br />
<br />
Story:  not much of one overall, a girl likes banana&#039;s and her friends and all the weird and crazy stuff they get into, but it has a silly charm to it.<br />
<br />
Art:   It&#039;s livable, it does the comedy well, but not the biggest highlight.<br />
<br />
Characters:   they are all over the top, crazy and silly and why I&#039;m enjoying it so far.<br />

    Aho girl is, despite the title, not actually an idiotic show. Yoshiko, the titular girl of the show, loves bananas, she loves Akutsu, and she loves playing around. She is also absolutely imbecilic, managing to consistently get 0&#039;s on every test in school. Yet she has a certain charm to her, and a devious insight into the behaviour of those around her, that sometimes make you wonder whether she&#039;s really stupid or just sees the world very differently from everyone else.<br />
<br />
Akutsu on the other hand is a thoroughly disagreeable fellow, he&#039;s very smart and has a punch that can knock out anyone. Most of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263875">
        time he&#039;s punching Yoshiko (in a gender equality kind of way which would make Kazuma of Konosuba proud).  The setup for many of the early jokes in the series relies on this dichotomy between Yoshiko and Akutsu. Yet the series quickly moves on to bigger and greater things. It parodies shounens, racing anime (the sequence which parodies Initial D is absolutely spot on), and most other genres under the sun. Even if you haven&#039;t seen the shows which it parodies, your enjoyment of it is hardly going to suffer. Aho Girl doesn&#039;t hold its punches, and toys around with all kinds of situational comedy, parody in general, as well as more down to earth humor about the human condition.<br />
<br />
This is a show that loves poking fun at others, but does so with a conscious nod to the genres it parodies. Not unlike One-Punch Man, the love toward the genres it makes fun of is ever-present. More than anything, the very short format of the series (12 minute episodes as compared to the 25 minute episodes of normal shows) makes for an absolute blast when watching Aho Girl. Any given episode usually has 2-4 stories in it, meaning even if one segment might not be in your taste, you&#039;re sure to get something wildly different within minutes.<br />
<br />
More than anything, Aho Girl is FUN. The jokes are often on point, the shenanigans of Yoshiko, the depraved nature of Fuuki Inchou, the long-suffering nature of Akutsu, the sweet nature of Sayaka who inexplicably agrees to most of the shenanigans, and the constant failures of Ruri, Akutsu&#039;s Aho sister, all plays into the manic nature of Aho Girl. This is a comedy show that&#039;s perfect to watch while eating, on the subway, or when you&#039;re bored. It is probably the most unexpectedly good show of the season it was released in and an absolute blast to watch.<br />
<br />
The lack of any cohesive narrative and some segments less interesting nature notches the show down a bit, but I would gladly recommend this show to anyone looking for a laugh.<br />
<br />
Aho Girl gets a well deserved 8/10

    loved the bit where the woman got beat, im very much for the abuse of woman so this anime was 10/10 for me, the way A-kun uppercuts her is so amazing and i wish he did it in every episode, the woman whos name i wont speak cos they dont deserve to have names was annoying but funny, but then again all women are annoying and are fun to laugh at and ridicule. anyways, the fact that some of the women didnt get beat was disappointing however, but makes up for it by beating the main woman so much that you dont even realise that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376091">
        the other women dont get beat, my summary is that just because its refreshing to see the women get beat up for once instead of the men its a 10/10, kinda wish she got killed tho<br />

    Many shows have adapted the funny and the idiotic main character,if written well can be really funny but that’s not the case with Aho girl .<br />
<br />
<br />
At first glance it seems like an average ok show but when you start to look at it fully it’s very mediocre . The jokes are very overused and the jokes themselves are quite stupid and distasteful . Most of the jokes are jokes about the girl’s serious obsession with bananas or plain poop jokes that sound like they were written by a seven year old .The characters are very generic and cliche,overall they are just plain. Most of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308931">
        side characters have no sort of personality.The amount of fan service is quite forced and sometimes put in the worst timing ever , which I get is for comedy but sometimes some shows cross the line . The animation isn’t the absolute worst but it’s far from great and the soundtrack is absolutely bad and annoying. The opening itself is just a plain annoying song with no thought process behind it and no sort of animation. <br />
<br />
Overall I don’t recommend this anime at all but if you like it go ahead and watch it .

    A Cast with a simple airheaded whiny control freak who&#039;s very obsessed with bananas <br />
<br />
and a loner caretaker childhood friend having a bad luck every day<br />
<br />
The possible relationship between the two are straight up Tsukkomi Boke routine, Mostly the teasing really reminds me Kashima and Hori from the way he treated very skeptically neither how possible dumb she can be.<br />
<br />
Detailed show with the same art as Mangaka-san to assistant-san, the gag can be specify less humor and sitcom from the most set of shows out there.<br />
<br />
First 5 minutes of scenario can simplify cracked you up very badly or if isn&#039;t really your cup of tea

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
The banana is sometimes considered one of nature’s most amazing creations.<br />
<br />
Commonly produced. Comes in bunches. Easy to hold. Sweet taste. Biodegradable packaging. Penchant for comedy. Not since the apple has there been such a fruit, such a food that has given humans so much with so little.<br />
<br />
While people love bananas, nobody loves them as much as Yoshiko of Aho Girl. And, while she may have less brains than one of these yellow-wrapped fruits, she upstages their comedic value with her own brazen stupidity.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
At roughly thirteen minutes per episode, Aho Girl has only so much time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293212">
        to get its audience laughing. The show knows this dilemma, and so it delivers unto them a near constant stream of comedy that does not stop for nearly its entire run.<br />
<br />
Much of this comedy revolves around Yoshiko, the titular character of this project and quite possibly the dumbest person to ever exist. Ever. That’s not a slight against her. Everyone in the show agrees with this statement, and Yoshiko herself couldn’t care less what others think about her let alone what they do for and around her.<br />
<br />
Which leads directly into what Aho Girl showcases.<br />
<br />
It loves its loudness. Yoshiko and the others did not learn about the concept of inside voices, so their exchanges quite quickly devolve into shouting matches. Admittedly, some people may be put off by the obnoxious yelling throughout the season, especially from the banana-pining girl who elevates her voice when even remotely excited. But such high energy supercharges the mundane events depicted, giving them a comedic push down the right path.<br />
<br />
Slapstick never goes away. Yoshiko’s vacant noggin equates to weakened pain receptors, so she often succumbs to many a bruising and a beating both of her own accord and at the hands of Akutsu. Of course, everyone involved punches, kicks, and tackles without remorse. From the three gyaru girls simultaneously punching the lovable idiot to Yoshie duking it out with Iinchou, the physical comedy complements the loudness with ease.<br />
<br />
The idiocy does not falter. The events seem normal at first, but Yoshiko’s arrival, words, or mere existence twist the dial of intelligence down to zero. She plays hide-and-seek for days on end. Akutsu and Dog bond over a particular movie scene. Yoshie must confirm Sayaka’s purity while revealing too much information about her own person. In other words, the show is stupid not in a negative sense but in a purposefully ridiculous one, further improving the overall hilarity.<br />
<br />
Aho Girl also makes small decisions here and there that help guide the show along. Its scenes split up into distinct parts with a small amount of crossover and callbacks to make the stream of comedy that much more digestible. Moreover, the show also varies up its content as much as it can, like when Yoshiko disguises as the male Yoshio to cheer up their teacher or that time where the group go on summer vacation filled with a couple of ecchi escapades.<br />
<br />
To be fair, nothing within the anime is exactly novel. But that doesn’t stop its loudness, its slapstick, and its idiocy from giving this comedy anime its clout.<br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Aho Girl continues its strong execution with an appreciable set of visuals.<br />
<br />
For instance, due to the time constraint, the show makes use of its opening track’s frames to deliver even more comedy. They almost always change the setup: Iinchou looking longingly at Akutsu, Sayaka acting as an angel in a play, a flurry of Yoshiko faces that fill the entire screen. Small stuff really, but these constant changes give the audience something to look forward to at the start of every episode rather than the same tired montage.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the anime includes elements that continue down its comedic path. Lots of speed lines accentuate the characters’ yelling and crazy actions. Missing pupils give them their “dead” looks after a kerfuffle of any kind. A cheerful banana censors out any particularly ecchi displays. And the various imaginative sequences, like a giant Banana Froppeccino Deluxe floating in the sky, a flurry of hearts as Yoshiko jumps in for a kiss, or a manga-like style as she races a motorbike rider while riding Dog herself, change up the often-lacking background artistry.<br />
<br />
The actual animation in general remains involved throughout the season, too, lending further credit to its strong execution. This direction is thanks mostly to the constant brawls, reactions, and situations the group normally find themselves in and make for each other.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Aho Girl does not perform as well when it comes to the designs of its characters. While the cast members often just wear their unassuming garb for school, their somewhat same-face looks – especially when yelling all big mouthed and wide eyed – reduce variety in their potential depictions the most. It also does not help that their colors and looks in general do not go for anything too striking.<br />
<br />
Even so, those fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and noticeable movements keep the anime going strong despite the designs not quite stacking up.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
As purely a comedy anime, the characters of Aho Girl focus first and foremost on, well, comedy. They toss aside complexity and say to themselves, “Let’s get the audience smiling with our strangeness.”<br />
<br />
Many of those smiles come from Yoshiko herself. It cannot be overstated how dumb she is. She has next to zero attention span, has little care for consequences, and has no desire to do anything except what she deems as in-the-moment fun.<br />
<br />
Thus, she does not pick up on even the most normal of societal cues, leading to her raucous behavior no matter where she is or what she is doing. It may mean running all the way to a farmer’s farm X kilometers away just to tell him that she likes his produce, or it could be the case that she pukes from eating one banana too many after declaring that she cannot eat another. Either way, Yoshiko refuses to follow the norm, and, for this reason, she improves the comedy present without fail.<br />
<br />
When she isn’t playing dolls a little too realistically with the local kids at the park, she often spouts backwards logic that somehow, someway makes sense in her signature lunacy. Most importantly, Yoshiko desensitizes the audience to and accentuates the strange traits of the other cast members. Akutsu’s standoffish personality. Iinchou’s stalking tendencies. Yoshie’s psychotic mindset (like mother, like daughter). If nothing else, Dog is literally smarter than her, giving his scenes an actual basis besides just being more aware than usual as a pet animal.<br />
<br />
In turn, Yoshiko’s relationships create even more comedic opportunities. Ruri is sadly an idiot like Yoshiko on certain levels, so Yoshiko tries to bond with her fellow moron whenever she can. Ryuuichi looks up to her as his boss, going from a delinquent to a dude who just wants to hang out with some friends. And Sayaka, the most regular person of the whole group, offsets Yoshiko’s overbearing asides, but even she breaks down on occasion around her friend, the contrast inviting another round of funnies.<br />
<br />
Yes, the characters are simple. But that fits Aho Girl perfectly. And, at the end of the day, they follow through on what they had in mind. Which means that it’s tough to ask for much more out of them.<br />
<br />
MUSIC &amp; SOUND<br />
<br />
The anime packs in as much fun into its audio design as it can.<br />
<br />
For starters, Aho Girl wouldn’t be Aho Girl without its, well, “aho” girl. To this end, Aoi Yuuki as Yoshiko deserves a ton of props for her lead role as the twin-tailed weirdo. If she isn’t passed out on the floor after taking a punch to the face, she’s yelling as much as possible, creating an annoying yet hilarious voice for the star that doesn’t let up for the show’s whole (and short) run.<br />
<br />
Tomokazu Sugita as Akutsu also dishes out hilarity with his scathing hatred for his less-than-ideal neighbor, but the opening track “Zenryoku☆Summer!” brings even more smiles into this sound space. During its one-minute timeframe, it goes all over the place while still following a clear path. Quick lyrical deliveries, differing vocal tones, bongos, the distinct noise of a metal bat hitting a baseball. Combined with the occasional chimes and goofier background sound-effects, the OP forms as a silly, catchy tune that sets the comedic tone for the series without any effort.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the music, however, doesn’t reach those same hits-a-funny-bone heights. The ending track “Odore! Kyu-kyoku Tetsugaku” is pretty much an afterthought, playing underneath the outro scenes of Aho Girl as a mediocre poppy song. And the original soundtrack – even with its different meandering, guitar, and classical pieces – doesn’t exactly push forward with a ton of intrigue. It at least doesn’t take anything away from the show, though.<br />
<br />
So, with hilarious VA performances and a just-as-funny OP to back them up, the music and sound for Aho Girl partly accomplishes arguably its most important goal: bringing a sizeable chunk of fun.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
It’s been a while since I laughed so consistently while watching one specific anime.<br />
<br />
In fact, I burst out laughing so much so that it would be unfair of me to list any scenes since they all got me smiling or chuckling. Of course, as a show defined by how funny its characters manage to be, they were the cornerstone to my laughter.<br />
<br />
Thinking back on the show, I liked all of them. Yoshiko somehow one-upping herself in stupidity constantly. Her mom Yoshie doing everything in her power to only allow Akutsu to hook up with her daughter to secure her future retirement. Dog being a good puppy. Akutsu’s little sister Ruri cutely struggling with life. Iinchou’s flashbacks and flashforwards. Sayaka crying as she barely keeps up with their collective antics. Their teacher Atsuko in the classic Christmas Cake role. The gyaru girls introducing a new angle. Ryuuichi just trying to be buddies with Akutsu. Sure, some are better than others, but they each still got me to laugh a lot all the same.<br />
<br />
Overall, I found that the anime was the right length for its content. It had some “romance” too which, while leading nowhere tangible, got a thumbs-up from me. And it also hardly ever strayed away from its comedy roots, remaining straightforward and sure of itself. Truth be told, this anime isn’t exactly clever let alone unique – but I wouldn’t want it to be any other way.<br />
<br />
Aho Girl no doubt embraces the first half of its title. It’s short. It’s quick. It’s funny. A three-way combo that ensures an entertaining time. While not the banana of this medium, it peels ahead regardless.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Good, loudness, slapstick, and of course idiocy keep the laughs of this multipart comedy streaming without ever showing any signs of stopping<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Good, fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and nice actual animation give the visuals strength even if the character designs do not<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Yoshiko is an unintentionally funny girl thanks to her “aho” nature, highlighting the strangeness of the other cast members and holding distinct relationships with all of them<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Sound: Fine, boisterous VA performances and a silly-sounding OP rise above a mediocre ED and a passable OST<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, have not laughed so much and so consistently in a long while<br />
<br />
Final Score: 7/10

    Warning possible Spoilers<br />
<br />
I decided to begin my summer anime crusade on something that I thought wasn&#039;t going to be that good, but surprisingly enough for an anime that is only 12 minutes per episode was actually entertaining.<br />
<br />
Story (6/10)<br />
<br />
The story is about Yoshiko Hanabatake a girl so stupid she gets zero&#039;s on every test and has a fascination with Banana&#039;s, the only person who can keep her stupidity in check is her friend Akuru Akutsu.<br />
Now the story is the weakest aspect of the show mainly because there isn&#039;t really a story at all though considering it was developed from a 4-Koma Manga it&#039;s going to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259784">
        difficult to make a full show from this and because of this there isn&#039;t really an end goal for the show instead it mainly has Yoshiko getting either herself, Akuru or even her friends into stupid or bad situations and everyone suffers for it in the end although it is very funny how they get into these messes.<br />
The final episode is what you think either as the final episode decides to be an origin story of how Yoshiko and Akuru met which was actually pretty good, but other than that there isn&#039;t much to say about the story hence why the score isn&#039;t that high.<br />
<br />
Characters (8/10)<br />
<br />
Now the characters were definitely a ball of fun especially Yoshiko who out of all the characters surprised me the most.<br />
Yoshiko is the female MC and is probably the most stupid character I have ever encountered, but much like Kintarou from Golden Boy this is a good stupid which is a stupid that will make you feel weird, but you will be laughing at the same time although it did surprise me how Yoshiko was very smart in one aspect and that was the art of love because somehow she made a teacher feel better about herself which is probably the only good thing she did in the show which also reminds that she is surprisingly contagious like her methods may be stupid, but they make people happy and overtime she actually starts making more and more friends from her actions which either felt like dumb luck or everyone is stupid too.<br />
Akuru the male MC is a rare site for me which is the male Tsundere and boy does he take the Tsundere troupe seriously yet you understand the suffering he has gone through with his relationship with Yoshiko since he has to deal with her stupidity 24/7  and this guy feels no remorse for her as he is happy to whack her in the face whenever she steps out of line, but he isn&#039;t always an angry looking guy because whenever he interacts with his sister or with Dog (yes that&#039;s the name of the dog) he actually seems like a kind guy yet somehow since his sister is suffering from whatever Yoshiko is he always ends up hurting her feelings.<br />
Sayaka is Yoshiko&#039;s best friend and is pretty much the most normal character of the show since she is the cute and innocent type however that doesn&#039;t stop her from blowing a gasket whenever Yoshiko or any of the other characters go a little too far like when Yoshiko and Iinchou snuck into Akuru&#039;s room.<br />
Iinchou is another female character who is the Disciplinary Committee President so she hates the stuff Yoshiko does, but she ends up having a crush on Akuru when he helps her out during one of Yoshiko&#039;s moments however her view of love is of the stalker type though not to the point of being a Yandere and whenever she tries to get close to him he just sees her moves as weird which always put&#039;s her down.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
<br />
Now the artstyle wasn&#039;t amazing it felt very samey compared to other anime&#039;s that I have seen or just not impressive, but for some reason the fact that Yoshiko always had this ridiculous smile on her face reminded me of the smile Saitama would make in OPM in fact everyone&#039;s facial expressions were actually really funny which is pretty much the reason why the art gets a 7.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
<br />
I know this is going to sound stupid, but that intro was actually very catchy because at first it seemed weird or stupid however the more I listened to it the more enjoyable it got which actually surprised me because the intro&#039;s from the spring period were actually very lackluster apart from a few and it&#039;s funny how the first intro I watch of the summer period is actually alright and I also liked how the intro had something different going on in the background.<br />
<br />
Extras:<br />
<br />
The comedy is the icing on the cake for this show because despite how stupid it was the comedy felt fresh in some way even when they were using cliched looking moments or scenes they didn&#039;t feel like rehashes of stuff we&#039;ve seen countless times in other anime&#039;s so I applaud this short series for managing to make something funny feel fresh for once.<br />
<br />
The romance part of the show is probably the most confusing one because you don&#039;t really know who to support because Yoshiko is stupid as hell, Akuru is a very violent and short-tempered person and Iinchou is a stalker leaving Sayaka as the only character who seems appealing yet she never gets any action which is funny yet sad at the same time so yeah a show like this having Romance just didn&#039;t feel right although it is strange how Yoshiko is actually a master at knowing the feeling of love.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10)<br />
<br />
Overall despite the length of the show it was a surprisingly entertaining show and a pretty good start to the summer 2017 anime&#039;s so if anyone&#039;s looking for something short that can give you a good laugh then try this one.

    &quot;Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.&quot;<br />
      - Robert A. Heinlein<br />
<br />
Take that quote, put it in anime form, and crank the &quot;stupidity&quot; up to 100. Then multiply that with the most fun you&#039;ve had in a long time. That&#039;s how Aho-Girl was created (literally, the title is exactly what it is). <br />
<br />
Many have written this anime off because of the countless number of memes and clips you&#039;ve seen of it on the internet make it seem like a joke. None of them have given it a fair chance. They don&#039;t know what they&#039;re missing out on.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Once upon a time,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266575">
        humanity was cursed by the gods and suffered a terrible fate. That fate was Hanabatake Yoshiko. She and her intricate tactics to overthrow humanity were bound to reign down on the mere mortals below in due time. Thus, it was up to Akutsu Akuru, humanity&#039;s knight in shining armor, to put a stop to this.<br />
<br />
You see, that was the dramatic version. In reality, this show is simply about a girl&#039;s stupidity and what kind of situations it puts herself and others in. While there is no overarching plot of speak of (except one man&#039;s struggle to stop her terror), each episode contains a few small, generally self-contained stories, that provide a stage for all the wacky antics we see our characters get themselves into. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
At first glance, the artwork and animation are quite basic. However, as the series progresses and the situations become more wild, the art becomes more distinct and expressive. If a character is mad, they look furious. If a character is shocked, they look distraught. The animation conveys every action and emotion with such fluidity and precision. <br />
In addition, there a few segments where the animators either change the style of the show completely, or change the kind of animation itself. At one point, a segment turns into a manga-like high-speed chase scene on a highway. Another time, it transforms into a shounen-like battle scene. In general, you&#039;re always in for a treat, even if there are a few noticeable mistakes and mishaps sprinkled throughout.<br />
Also, the opening for every episode changes. For a show that you&#039;d think would have a low-budget, this is quite unique and deserves praise.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Every time music plays, it fits the scene it accompanies well. In addition, the opening and ending themes are nice to listen. As for the opening in particular, it displays the show&#039;s playful and upbeat nature perfectly. <br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
I&#039;ll go ahead and say this now, there is very minimal character development to be found. Yet, the show dances around this roadblock with grace. Each character has great chemistry with every other character they interact with. The characters are what sold this anime to me. Every funny moment is because of the characters. While the characters could technically be defined as one-note, each individual personality is so strong that you won&#039;t care in the end. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I&#039;d be lying if this wasn&#039;t one of the funniest anime I&#039;ve seen. The anime is bold in nature and constantly strives to defy one&#039;s expectations of what comes next. Every trope that it could possibly be subjected to, is turned on it&#039;s head. Every episode was like a roller coaster, except the ride only ever went down when it was finished.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
This anime is not meant to be judged critically. By those standards, the show is quite poor. However, if you are willing to turn off your brain for 12 minutes at a time, you will love this anime for what it is. If you legitimately give it a chance, you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br />
