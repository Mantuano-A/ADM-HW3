    So, coming from someone whose read the webtoon…. LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY. Okay, so there are multiple problems with this crunchyroll webtoon collaboration. The first problem, is that this starts in the 2ND SEASON of the story. So your going to be completely lost if you start with this series, unless you saw the OVA episode from 4 years ago. Which, frankly, is a fucking disaster as they jammed a whole season’s worth of content into a single 30 minute episode. I have no clue why they didn’t start fresh, that’s just really bad marketing. The only reason I would think why they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362440">
        would start in the second season is that that is when the majority of main characters are introduced, but that is honestly a really bad reason to skip so much story content. If Tower of God was a good adaption, God of High School fun but rushed, then Noblesse is devoid of any and all structure or backstory.<br />
<br />
I have to say, if this is your first introduction into the series, I am so sorry. I would try to summarize what the show is about… but 3 episodes actually doesn’t explain anything about what’s happening. Nothing does, and looking at this show without the context of the webtoon, it just comes across as a slow paced shonen with weird pacing. In the words of a god: My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. Peak it if you’ve already read the source material and want to see them move, but otherwise, as much as it pains me to say it, if you haven’t read Noblesse, then I wouldn’t blame you for skipping this entry.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just in a constant state of shock with how badly they botched it, how could they start a series in its 2nd season with an offensively rushed 30 minute OVA from 4 years ago as the official 1st season source for all your information? You for sure would be lost if you just started watching this show without any context. And as it progresses, even if you just think of it as a second season, your still going to be disappointed with the lacking animation, glossed over story, and terrible handling of its characters when it comes to building the relationships with each other. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, this adapts a second season of a webtoon that would greatly benefit from a proper adaptation of its first season, and non-webtoon readers would be completely lost while watching. Art is lacking, story isn&#039;t structured well, and everything suffers.

    MILD SPOILERS AHEAD<br />
<br />
WebToon Anime only ever made sense in hindsight. Back when &quot;Tower of God&quot; was airing I expressed my excitement for what could have been a landmark turning point for both the WebToon and anime markets. I stand by everything I said, and there are undoubtedly good results achieved with this venture. A quick search on Google Trends would reveal that interest in WebToons and Manhwa skyrocketed with the release of ToG. If the goal was to create commercially successful products that brought WebToons mainstream prevalence, the production committees at Crunchyroll certainly succeeded. But despite the corporate success, it&#039;s difficult to view this partnership

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370793">
        without some degree of cynicism; the flagship adaptations themselves have left a weak first impression. At best, they were middling half-measures that somewhat managed to hint at greater things to come; at worst, they did disgraceful disservice to the source material being promoted. And that brings us to where we are today. ToG was a flawed, but promising, adaptation that oozed with potential. But &quot;God of High School&quot; was all style with no substance, and today&#039;s case study, &quot;Noblesse,&quot; possesses neither. At the very least the sheer lunacy of GoHS was capable at provoking a vitriolic response from me. But soulless unambition confines this husk of a show to an arguably worse fate - indifference. Here&#039;s how. This review contains mild spoilers, but skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you&#039;re short on time.<br />
<br />
Noblesse is built around a powerful entity living amongst men. After an 820-year slumber, the mysterious Raizel awakens, à la Rip Van Winkle. He is a member of the Nobles, a secluded race charged with protecting mankind from afar. Finding himself far from home, Raizel decides to live a peaceful life in modern-day South Korea. The show is split into two arcs, both of which are concerned with factions alerted to his &quot;Awakening.&quot; His incredible abilities are rarely put on display, instead serving as the impetus for power struggles and internal politics. These conflicts and Raizel&#039;s new way of life are what the show utilises to explore certain ideas. But before we take that deep dive, there is something that needs to be addressed. For those of you who don&#039;t know, Noblesse the Anime does not share the same chronological beginning as the original webcomic. A 2016 prequel, titled &quot;Noblesse: Awakening,&quot; is the canonical start of our story, and the anime decided to continue where that OVA left off. Personally I didn&#039;t see a need to catch that prequel, given that the anime was never advertised as a follow-up. Way I see it, the existence of the source material or other adaptations doesn&#039;t absolve this individual instalment of meeting fundamental story objectives. My beliefs aside, I&#039;m not one to tell you whether the OVA is necessary viewing or not, but I believe there is merit in making observations off the anime alone. And the show does attempt to make the best out of its 13 episodes, isolating a specific time period in order to deliver a narrative and thematic context one could understand as an entry point into the franchise. It&#039;s all just not very good.<br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s message carries noble intentions, but lacks meaning. Noblesse emphasizes the importance of setting aside our differences. All of us may come from various backgrounds, or possess unique traits. But no single member of mankind holds greater value than any other individual, nor is anyone entitled to unjustly take that value from someone else for personal gain. You and I are different, but you and I are the same, and should be treated as such. Throughout the series, there&#039;s this healthy lifestyle being promoted, showing how wonderful it is to live in peace and harmony with those around us. This is contrasted with the true enemy of Noblesse: systemically-corrupt organizations which represent dehumanization at its ugliest extreme. Be it greedy, soulless monsters or authority figures driven to irrationality, the antagonists of Noblesse abuse their powers at the expense of others. It&#039;s up to our boy Raizel and his crew to stand up for the little guy and maintain the balance. It&#039;s a solid message, and one that is certainly welcome in our politically-charged landscape. Let&#039;s not draw lines in the sand or discriminate, but go the distance to understand and love others instead. Let&#039;s join forces against systemic oppression, let&#039;s band together against the evils threatening to break us. The Noblesse OP sums up this idea through an emotionally-stirring refrain: &quot;So why does everybody hurt each other?&quot; These sweet sentiments sound an awful lot like propaganda, but there&#039;s no need to worry about things getting too preachy. Because while being thematically framed as propaganda, Noblesse undermines its own points by not saying much of anything at all.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m going to be demonstrating how this series is lacking in the execution of its intended message. The following three points covered here aren&#039;t necessary to every story of this nature. Rather, they&#039;re here to highlight how the thematic storytelling fails to be convincing. Firstly, let&#039;s address Raizel and others of his kind. Noblesse implies countless differences between Nobles and humans, but doesn&#039;t give much for the audience to work with. For a show featuring Nobles for a significant chunk of the runtime, we sure know next-to-nothing about them, aside from their incredible powers and boomer mannerisms. Why is their society so secluded from the outside world? Why are they supposedly incompatible with the humans they once protected? How does their society, ideologies and way of life differ from ours? Are there negative repercussions should our worlds collide? I&#039;d like to think there are answers to these fascinating questions, but I just can&#039;t find them within this adaptation. The difference matters to the message, showing that anybody can see eye-to-eye and seek common ground. But there is no context, and as a result there&#039;s no real conflict between either party, rendering any commentary on this subject meaningless. Granted, it may not be fair to look from this perspective; even though the script seems like it would tackle this topic, neither of the show&#039;s two arcs really attempt to address this issue. So let&#039;s go ahead and talk about those instead; specifically, how they fail to portray moral ambiguity. Good and Evil are two ends of a spectrum, with the show&#039;s cast clumped together on either end. Bad people are capable of doing good things, and they can&#039;t simply abandon their flawed nature at the drop of a hat. But very rarely does the show burden itself with positioning our characters in the middle; there is no moral grey area. Noblesse chooses to play these concepts as straight as possible, watering-down the conversation to its most basic principles. For example, take the villains from the Union, some of whom are cold-blooded murderers who ingest pills that turn them into literal monsters, horrifyingly disfigured and dehumanized. There&#039;s no doubt in everyone&#039;s mind that Raizel would obliterate such cruel killers without a second thought. But the very moment one of the antagonists reveals some sign of humanity, their lives are immediately spared, and they suddenly become capable of doing no wrong. These moral questions are made to be as simple as possible, offering no substance in stating the obvious. What happens if you&#039;re on the bad end of the spectrum, and are finding it hard to work towards that harmonious middle ground? Well, Noblesse just throws up its hands in the air and adds nothing else to the subject. Those reformed characters from the Union are magically OK with their new social standings and doing good deeds, because that&#039;s how rehabilitation and life works, apparently. The third example I&#039;d like to point out is the show&#039;s assessment of what unity means. Raizel and his growing group of besties enjoy a quaint suburban life, but rarely do we see them make connections with normal human folk. Within Raizel&#039;s household, peeps from various backgrounds do interact with each other. But there&#039;s no real attempt at understanding each other, nor is there an apparent need to. There&#039;s no difficulty faced, nor adjustments made, nor compromises agreed upon. Similar to my first point, there is no conflict, and it&#039;s hard to care. Everyone&#039;s just happy chilling at home and at their workplace, instantly bonding without putting in any effort. Two teenage students who had grown acquainted with Raizel&#039;s crew almost served as the human core of the group, only to unceremoniously disappear entirely from the narrative, because Noblesse decided that it was a good time to throw in exposition about random in-world politics. Closest we get to mutual understanding between different groups of people is one line of exposition, which I believe embodies a lot of the issues I have with Noblesse&#039;s thematic half-measures. Raizel&#039;s butler, Frankenstein, clues one of the main characters in on a brief history of Nobles and humans, back in Episode 2. In describing the relationship between both races, Frankie claimed that humans were weak and solely dependent on the Nobles to survive. Now that Raizel has opened his horizons to see human life up-close, he clearly knows that hypothesis isn&#039;t true and realises how his native society&#039;s misconceptions are false. But that&#039;s just it, there was never any intention to convince the audience otherwise. Of course humans are not helpless, how could they be anything but? Noblesse prides itself in making digestible, weak arguments, expecting a pat on the back and thunderous applause. It hints at a greater conversation, but drains all nuance from it, to the point where most potential meaning is lost. I must apologize if you felt that you didn&#039;t really gain anything from this long-ass paragraph, because I know that feeling too. It&#039;s the experience I had with this show; Noblesse is ultimately a show about nothing.<br />
<br />
Critiquing Noblesse for what it attempts to do is marginally more interesting than what it actually is. A vast majority of Noblesse comes across as… a school-based SOL. That&#039;s right, this story is played straight to be a slice-of-life. This cast of powerful idiots are either commuting to school or playing House at Raizel&#039;s. Bursts of serious exposition regarding investigations or politics are often quickly interrupted by long stretches of repetitive comedy sketches. Cutting out all the times Raizel and his bros get called &quot;hot&quot; by every minor girl in the high school cohort would end up halving the season&#039;s episode count. Episode 7, the all-time low for the series, sees one of Raizel&#039;s fellow Noble getting crushed on by a student, followed by Raizel&#039;s chummy friends playing a basketball match. What makes these unfunny skits all the more annoying are the copy/pasted cast of characters. People might find Noblesse&#039;s non-personalities entertaining, and I&#039;d be inclined to agree if everyone wasn&#039;t a carbon copy of one another. Noblesse&#039;s crew of genetically-superior expository devices are the literary equivalent of &quot;Hey Man, Can I Copy Your Homework?&quot; Eccentricity is fun in small doses, but cramming in this cast of stock characters sucks any life or chemistry to be had in the group dynamic. This means that scenes play out exactly the same, because all of the characters in them are exactly the same. The VAs soft-spoken, stoic delivery makes this issue worse, as half the damn characters sound painfully indistinguishable from one another. Every good guy&#039;s vocal inflection is equally polite and devoid of all personality. It has been annoying to hear a huge chunk of the cast members talking like they&#039;re all auditioning for roles in a fujoshi-bait butler anime. Of course, I mean no offence to those who find pleasure in those sorts of things; if those BL shows are to your fancy, you could do far better than this bland bunch of refugees in a PTSD halfway house. You could also settle for more in the visuals department; Production I.G. phoned in their work with all the brilliant aesthetic of a 2010s Man of Action cartoon. Lighting is fine, but backgrounds and character designs leave much to be desired. The show goes as far as to reskin their characters&#039; supernatural abilities as much as possible, and the same goes for the repetitive backdrops of drab city skylines and stiff forests. The soundtrack is unmemorable, but I quite liked the opening and ending songs. The fact that the ED&#039;s K-Pop manages to be the best part of half of these anime episodes is pretty damning of the show&#039;s quality.<br />
<br />
Tl;Dr:<br />
<br />
&quot;The most destructive criticism is indifference.&quot; E.W. Howe. I&#039;d like to think I&#039;ve done my best to find something worth caring about in this show, but it appears that Noblesse seems less interested in its own story than I am. The series&#039; subtext is watered-down to merely stating the obvious, with holes distracting from any positive takeaways. It&#039;s a pandering script that fails to pander effectively, and an action show that feels like it barely has any to deliver. Noblesse is at times not a show with supernatural combat, but a stiff, unfunny SOL that&#039;s one sexual awakening away from turning into BL. Visuals are unappealing, music is unmemorable. Noblesse makes mistakes in almost every regard, but it&#039;s no trainwreck. And that&#039;s a damn shame, because at least it&#039;s fun to see things go off-the-rails with trashy shows. Instead, all I&#039;m left with after Noblesse, is sheer indifference. 3/10~<br />

STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):<br />
<br />
- Out of the 12 eps we got (let&#039;s be honest, Ep 7 was a fkin OVA,) I only had a good time with one, Ep 8. Up till that point we barely had any info about who the Nobles are or where they were from, so the visit to Lukedonia was a refreshing change of scenery. We also had Young Frankenstein, who was the only fun character in the show…<br />
- …Until he wasn&#039;t. The episode immediately following saw the novelty of the flashback wear off, and the show&#039;s only strong character along with it. YF all but disappeared between episodes, and all we were left with was boring ol&#039; Frankie. I was disconnected from the rest of the episode, because the arc made zero sense! How does the Big Bad Bully of Lukedonia go from declaring his lifelong hatred for Nobles in one episode, to subservient servitude with zero complaints under a member of said Nobles? And what&#039;s more confusing is that the Blood Pact thing only happened at the end of Ep 9, which still leaves the question of what happened to YF during this time unanswered. This scene could have been a massive moment for the series, as Raizel and YF set aside their differences with their union. But again, the show just expects us to shut up and accept what&#039;s offered.<br />
- So remember how the Union hacker and the schoolboy hacker had this &quot;Aneki&quot; relationship, only for it to disappear with the memory wipe and never addressed again? God, this show was such a waste of time.<br />
- Rael really got his ass confined for 10 years over getting rejected. Fs in chat maybe, Idc.<br />
- Crunchyroll, Sony, Whomever I Need to Talk to: Please give your WebToon adaptations more episodes. Each of them needed more time to tell compelling stories, and all three fell short of that. Well, maybe more eps wouldn&#039;t have saved this script, but still.<br />
- BEST GIRL: No one really deserves this award, but I&#039;ll offer it to Young Frankenstein for being such a badass chad. Genuinely fun on-screen presence. Plus he&#039;s practically shipped with Raizel for life, and he definitely wears the pants in that relationship. YF, FTW.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
And we&#039;re through with this show, good riddance. Really wasn&#039;t looking forward to covering this mess. I guess you can call me a WebToon completionist from now on, here&#039;s hoping I finally find more nice things to say about the state of these subpar adaptations. If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews for seasons past and present. Have a Happy New Year, peace~

    Noblesse was a pretty fun and enjoyable watch. Nothing spectacular, but nothing awful either. <br />
<br />
Like most things in life, Noblesse has some pros and cons. I’ll start with the bad. Noblesse, the anime, is probably the walking definition of mediocre. The series sets up a lot of cool and interesting mysteries and plot points, but the execution feels lacklustre and leaves much to be desired. The first 4-5 episodes were really good and then I felt it was downhill from there. The final third of the show had some cool fights and nice moments between the characters, but that’s about it.<br />
<br />
Now that I’ve got the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370783">
        bad out of the way, Noblesse does have some good things going for it. For one, it’s by far the best adapted webtoon anime of the year. GoH and ToG suffered from tremendous pacing issues, but Noblesse did a really good job of bringing the manhwa to life. The comedy is decent, the fights are really well animated and the world is interesting. I do appreciate the fact that the story is very character driven and not just another battle shonen style set up like GoH and ToG. Dialogue and the relationship between characters are huge here. <br />
<br />
My gripe with the story mainly comes from the second half of the show. There’s a key moment with one of the main characters that marks a turning point in the anime, and it seems like once this character faded, so did my interest. The “Lord” arc that takes up the final 4-5 episodes had potential to be really good, but the “antagonist’s” motivations were so weak and shallow to me that it was hard to take it seriously. The final episode was handled pretty well which probably saved its score for me, though.<br />
<br />
Despite it’s flaws, I did enjoy Noblesse quite a bit and think it had a lot of potential. I do recognise the fact we only saw a few chapters out of a massive work. The whole concept of vampire nobles, mysticism and human genetic engineering is cool. I just wish the story had been a bit better down the stretch. Noblesse gets 7 cups of tea out of 10.<br />

    It&#039;s not uncommon for an anime to drift away from the adapted material. Sometimes it&#039;s good, sometimes very bad. <br />
<br />
When Crunchyroll announced the anime adaptations of 3 major webtoons — Tower of God, The God of High School and Noblesse, I was pretty thrilled. It was desire fulfilled of watching webtoons being animated. After watching numerous manga turning into anime, it was time to enjoy something new. But alas, it didn&#039;t work out well. So far, all the adaptations coproduced by Crunchyroll have been utter garbage. They&#039;ve done everything they can to promote themselves even if it hurdles the story or makes it less enjoyable.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370909">
        And Noblesse has been a victim of this.<br />
<br />
The very first OVA of Noblesse — Noblesse: Awakening, animated by Production I.G. is mesmerizing. Even though there were some minor details removed and the story was changed, it was amazing. Every single moment of that OVA was worth watching. I was really impressed with I.G. and was hoping they&#039;d do great with this anime too. Alas, I was mistaken. <br />
<br />
This adaptation of Noblesse is nothing more than to give hatred to webtoons in general. None of the adapted webtoons gave a sense of &quot;hype&quot; nor &quot;promote&quot; the webtoons. Here are some of the major faults in Noblesse anime:<br />
<br />
1. The anime started from the point where the OVA (Noblesse: Awakening) ended. <br />
<br />
They didn&#039;t bother to give some highlights of what happened before. Majority of the audience were clueless about the scenario and had to do a little bit of research before continuing. But not all of them were to energetic for it, as they simply dropped it and rated it 1 and moved on. Just shows how awful the direction of the first episode was.<br />
<br />
2. The anime changed the location from South Korea to Japan.<br />
<br />
Now this is something that sticks out for me. Why change the location entirely just because it&#039;s being animated in Japan? Personally, this felt like they&#039;re either trying to claim that Noblesse is a Japanese story or have a superior mentality that anything animated in Japan will have the details of Japan only. Which in my opinion, is a very bad move. Not only did they change the location, but also changed the names of the characters from Korean to Japanese. This also happened with Tower of God where Bam&#039;s name was changed to Yoru to accommodate a Japanese name. But that too was a bad idea. <br />
The idea of changing something entirely to a native perspective by discrediting the official name is disrespectful. It&#039;s like Japanese mangaka creating a new Batman story, but instead of naming Batman as Bruce Wayne, they name him Wozaru Koto. Did that make any sense? Nope. So, in general, I found this pretty bad and it made me enjoy the story less.<br />
<br />
3. The plot was changed as per the studio&#039;s need to adapt only certain things to fill in 13 episodes.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not a new thing for the anime to be different than the adapted material. But to literally change everything? That&#039;s a no bueno. As far as I can see, they butchered major parts of the story. When the poster was revealed for the anime, Raskreia was also included in there. Which pretty much made me confirm that the anime was adapting everything till the end of Lukedonia. As a person who read the entire webtoon of Noblesse, I knew it was going to be horsecrap. The anime robbed us of key moments such as thrills, excitement, and the joy of learning something new in the story by skipping most of the things.<br />
<br />
4. The characters are weird, weak and too emotional.<br />
<br />
After watching Episode 13, I couldn&#039;t help but facepalm. They made Raskreia out of all characters to be a normal girl with feelings. No, that&#039;s not the Raskreia we know. In the webtoon, Raskreia doesn&#039;t know it&#039;s Cadis who has infiltrated in Lukedonia until he steps in the tomb room. She does have the idea that Cadis was a traitor, but doesn&#039;t know his whereabouts for centuries. She&#039;s mostly shown as a proud character who can take her own decisions without hesitation. Though she does take a few bad decisions. And for the love of god, she doesn&#039;t grovel like a girl who has just been dumped by her crush. So far, all I saw was how they belittled the anime that it&#039;s not even funny to laugh at.<br />
<br />
5. Character Designs<br />
<br />
Almost 50% of the characters shown in the anime have a weak design as compared to the webtoon. Raizel&#039;s entire body is weak, with his hair being totally different; Seira&#039;s face and hair are different; Gejutel&#039;s beard is different; etc. In short, their main plan to make the anime bad worked. <br />
<br />
6. Voice Actors<br />
<br />
Now, I don&#039;t really want to be picky in terms of voices, but I need to state it. The studio didn&#039;t do a good job hiring appropriate voice actors. In my opinion, it felt as if they just chose whoever signed up for it. When reading the webtoon, I always read Regis&#039; lines in the voice of Toshiro from Bleach, since it resembles him a bit. But here, the impact wasn&#039;t the same, but it wasn&#039;t that bad either. And Karias&#039; voice was very different. That I didn&#039;t like.<br />
<br />
In the end, I&#039;d like to say that this was a very adaptation of the webtoon. Crunchyroll did a very bad job in promoting it. Though they got what they wanted — Publicity. If you&#039;re wondering to watch the anime of Noblesse, I suggest you stop right away. You&#039;ll miss out on a lot of things and won&#039;t get the joy of reading the original story. That is all.

    Before I start the review, I do want to say that this is from the first four episodes. So take it as you can. But let me explain my thoughts on Noblesse so far.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s...OK at best so far, it&#039;s certainly a much slower pacing than GOH that is for sure, but wouldn&#039;t call it a bad show, more something I bet as it goes along, will spawn into a much higher rating then I am giving it currently. I am enjoying it, but wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s a top 5 of the season at all. <br />
<br />
The story...It&#039;s hard to describe really, since the plot moves at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361773">
        such a slow pace, while it gives you time to learn and accept all that is happening, the slow moving can be a little off putting to some. So far we know that there is a secret organization finally making their move in order for world conquest, using modified humans to do such, and need to eliminate a few that would be in the way of such, while our main MC whom hardly speaks at all, tries to learn about modern life through school. Along with a colourful cast of characters around him to boot.<br />
<br />
The characters so far are actually pretty fun. The MC is a laugh with how he doesn&#039;t talk at all, While someone like Han is a really great character that you can respect for who he is, and his strong sense of goodness. It&#039;s good stuff there. Some may look bland also, but there are a fair few that do carry the show in a better light.<br />
<br />
As for the art? It&#039;s good, they really did a good job when it comes to making sure each scene is either bright, or dark and grim to fit the mood. Much like the sounds of the show in general.<br />
<br />
Should you watch? I&#039;d say yes, while it might not look like much at first going, but I&#039;m sure as it continues, it&#039;ll grow into something even better.

    I was really glad to know that Noblesse got an adaptation, cause you see, I actually enjoyed the source a lot. It had style, it had development, it was a really good read. So imagine my disappointment when I got THIS instead of a good adaptation. And here I am, telling you why you should just go and read the original and not waste your time here.<br />
Story. The source story can hardly be called sophisticated or deep, but it was descent. But in adaptation there are a few problems, and the first one starts even before the anime itself: the first arc of web manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370789">
        is an OVA so this &quot;first season&quot; of anime already starts after some events and you have to go and watch it. Second problem: lots of things got thrown out. I am ok with throwing out jokes, maybe some details, but in that case even some of the characters were thrown out entirely. While I could agree that they were not major characters in the story, still not seing them here feels rather sad. Apart from characters, way too many detailes got tossed under the buss, that added a lot into the world, and now said world looks like a blanket with lots of small holes - not great. But for some reason, some absolutely discardable moments were kept, and that created a third big problem - pacing, cause the plot either rushes like a madman, or suddenly stops like a stubborn mule. This all made me, the watcher, really confused, even though I am one of those who actually knew the plot beforehand.<br />
Art - simple, way too simple. I understand that animating is hard, but when web comic has better fights and special effects - why did you even bother to adapt such a hard thing for you to make? Just grab another slice of life where you can manage without a single effect or bright colour.<br />
Sound - uninsipiring and boring. Plain and generic. <br />
Character - as I said earliers, lots of things got cut. What is even more insulting - lots of things were not showed properly, like some character moments lacked tension, some lacked emotion. To be honest, I think that even for someone who has no clue about the original, characters will come off as boring and plain. For people who read the source - it is simply insulting.<br />
Enjoyment - fast skipping forward and going to re-read the source. Waste of time, waste of efford, waste of potential.<br />
<br />
Overall - don&#039;t bother, just read the original, it is really good.

    I know we don&#039;t want to get our expectations so high up because we all knew the recent webtoon adaptation was a tragedy from GoH.<br />
But don&#039;t let the stereotype control you that much because this series deserves every little bit of praises they got.<br />
<br />
Noblesse, to be said is, one of the biggest 3 name in webtoon industry between Tower of God, and The God of Highschool.<br />
<br />
Why is it so famous? Is it because the fan-girls? or Is it because of the theme? cool and badass MC?<br />
<br />
The answer is yes and no. It is yours to judge.<br />
For a long time fan such as myself, was it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362057">
        worth the wait? The answer is surely yes. Noblesse is one of the most memorable series for me because of the uniqueness of their characters. And the story? You will know it later why it&#039;s so intriguing for a vampire-supernatural theme.<br />
<br />
Okay. now let&#039;s focus on the anime<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
The story was set clear that it points out the after-story of Noblesse:Awakening. Let&#039;s just say the prequel is so essential to the part of the story. And it&#039;s a MUST to watch. You must be a fool if you didn&#039;t watch it first.<br />
<br />
So how&#039;s the change between the 4 years gap of production?<br />
I&#039;d say this has been the better than all ToG and GoH adaptations<br />
The episodes so far had a decent pace for a shonen-genre, and the prequel already filled the empty gap between the introduction of the characters, so far it&#039;s very decently paced even though they did cut some stuff which is for me unnecessary stuffs (like they changed the setting to nippon instead of korea and cutting Yuna entirely), the good thing is the humor element included in the anime so far has been really really on point. You&#039;d be surprised how funny Frankenstein&#039;s reaction is.<br />
Rai&#039;s design in the anime also looks cleaner and more suitable with his character, with his eye is the signature expression from him.<br />
The animation looks a standard fantastic Production IG&#039;s level, &amp; the sound was absolutely flawless, love how it resonance the vampires medieval times. My favorite part is the logo. The logo looks dope especially after they used it as a transitional scene, that&#039;s something they need to use every now and then. It gives a strong vampire vibes too.<br />
At last, Noblesse so far is absolutely a banger, and it keeps getting better until the true action will come up, and it makes me want to higher up my expectation. But I still won&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s just hope they keep it good this way.<br />
<br />
NOTICE: I may change the review &amp; score depends on how every episodes will gonna be.

    Never ever underestimate the power of the mighty Cruchyroll X Manhwa combo.<br />
ToG was badly paced and with an abysmal wouldbuilding and more plotholes than characters but there was a spark of something.<br />
GoH had a terrible story, random power up, messed up power levels but some smooth animations (not really great fight directing though).<br />
<br />
This has nothing, I can&#039;t even tell you why it&#039; bad because there is nothing to comment: random fights where the strongest characters don&#039;t even lift a finger, paper thin &quot;I&#039;m revaluating Twilight&quot; vampire character, mediocre animations and overall the worst animated thing I&#039;ve seen in the last year (and only because I&#039;m

    One of the most underrated shows in this season.<br />
<br />
So far, I love it. Not much actions, but solid art + lovely characters.<br />
<br />
Story is very much like 1/3 Bleach + 1/3 Overlord + 1/3 One punch man. Interestingly, MC doesn&#039;t get much attention while other side characters get more scenes. Many people complain about the phase, but from ep5, it started to burn fiercely.<br />
<br />
In sum:<br />
<br />
Qualities of art, characters, animation are definitely top notchs.<br />
<br />
About sound, it is decent. Especially I love op and ed songs.<br />
<br />
Story is typical shonen manga, but very unique. It is getting better and better, so at the end, I am sure this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362788">
        will be one of the top anime in this season. Even now, it is a lot highly rated by people in Japan. It is probably about cultural preferences between Eastern (value more about story building up + need more time for emotional attachments for characters) vs Western (immediate action + cool visual animation).<br />

    Webtoon adaptations have become a failure, and Noblesse is no exception, and yet this is probably the worst of them all. Look, I only saw 4 episodes, which is only 1/3 of the season or whatever, and who knows? Maybe the next 8 episodes are masterpieces. But no matter, I still couldn&#039;t enjoy this as much I wanted to. I really wanted to enjoy this, but I couldn&#039;t. Noblesse has loads of love on the webtoon, but this? This only let us know Webtoons as anime doesn&#039;t go well. What they most suffered from was a rushed pacing as they only could work with 13

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362183">
        episodes. I think Crunchyroll was the reason for that so they&#039;re the blame, otherwise they&#039;re okay. I thought Tower of God was fine, but disliked God of Highschool. They both were so rushed that it ruined the series and left a bitter taste after seeing the series. And yet, Noblesse isn&#039;t rushed?<br />
<br />
Noblesse has over 9 on webtoon. Obviously you can&#039;t compare that with the anime, but it&#039;s still pretty damn hard to see why. Noblesse is incredibly slow which is weird as hell unless they&#039;re adapting 1 episode per... episode? But seriously this is weird and just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Story 3/10<br />
Like I said before, Noblesse suffered from an incredibly slow story. You&#039;d probably get news about Noblesse&#039;s announcement from Internet Explorer faster than Noblesse&#039;s story. That&#039;s weird as hell. I expected to get the story immediately after the past 2 webtoon anime, but it wasn&#039;t. Isn&#039;t there so much content to use? Don&#039;t you only have 13 episodes? Seriously? And I&#039;m gonna be honest and say I&#039;d rather have a confusing, but speedy anime rather than a non-progressive plot. Even though I didn&#039;t like GOH I still kinda enjoyed it because at least we saw something.<br />
<br />
Not only is the pacing horrendous, but the actual story is just... bad...<br />
<br />
I mean look at the premise of Noblesse:<br />
<br />
&quot;Raizel wakes up after a 820 year slumber...&quot;<br />
Mmhmm...<br />
&quot;...and enrolls into a high school.&quot;<br />
Never mind...<br />
<br />
Seriously, doesn&#039;t that seem lame as hell? However the noble thing got me intrigued and so I started watching, but I expected a lackluster story. And I was still disappointed. Yes the plot isn&#039;t any better. And the main reason is because literally nothing happens. As well as the pacing that makes snails seem FTL, all it seems like is some weird slice-of-life with superpowers. Noblesse is supposed to be some action-battle story and yet we see none of that. Isn&#039;t there some bad guys you need to get rid of? Why am I stuck seeing some moron worry if his friend is gay? Really? Is this what you want to do? But hey, you do you. The slice-of-life itself isn&#039;t really that entertaining either. It&#039;s just stuff that made me question whatever the hell I just saw. I have seen 1hr and 20min of content and nothing? Come on.<br />
And the fact that there&#039;s barely any plot makes me have qeustions. Like for example, how the hell was Raizel asleep for 820  years to begin with? Who are these random bad guys? Why did these people sleep for 820 years too? Or are they? But that is a stupid point of me to make anyway since there&#039;s no way I should expect that to be answered to 4 episodes, but at least the curiosity of this show is more entertaining than the plot of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
The art actually looks decent though. It&#039;s definitely a good style that gives a nice serious seinen vibe. It looks great to look at and the background art isn&#039;t bad either. The animation is okay, but there&#039;s not much action to show it off at all. There&#039;s no reason why you would be disappointed with the art so you won&#039;t go &quot;Ewwww&quot; at all (yet) so that&#039;s fine. Although that guy whose friends with the red haired dude? The one with the longish hair? It&#039;s nothing new, but I was confused at this guy&#039;s gender because of the way he was depicted. It was confusing, but just a head&#039;s up, he&#039;s a guy (maybe)<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
Not much to say? OST isn&#039;t bad, but not memorable. OP is okay but the start sounded like some weirdo trying to hold in a sneeze while crying and choking at his tears. Or trying to hold in a laugh because it&#039;s so easy it laugh when you are in moments when you shouldn&#039;t. Other that that it is okay. Ending was okay too.<br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
Raizel is some calm guy. Others are the exact same, just one is more angry. The red-haired guy is good, but he can be irritating. There really isn&#039;t much depth to the characters nor any ambition or... anything else. The bad guys are just random guys. Why does every girl need to go &quot;OMG THAT GUY IS SO HOT11!!!11!!&quot;? Why can&#039;t the red-haired guy mind his own business? Don&#039;t dms people in someone else&#039;s account. The characters are just bland with nothing to them. They really aren&#039;t entertaining and it&#039;s hard to look forward to them coming on screen. There&#039;s nothing to say about them because they&#039;re that boring. Wait, there&#039;s some obsession with ramen! That&#039;s all I know about them. Then again this is unfair as I only seen 4 episodes, but this still is depicted poorly.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 2/10<br />
Story, pacing, characters are garbage. The okay theme songs and the art are stuff I like though. But overall it&#039;s a borefest.<br />
<br />
Overall 2/10<br />
Just eat a bowl of ramen and crap something better than this.

    I haven&#039;t read the webtoon and I had no idea about what I&#039;m getting into which gave me the 100% anime experience. <br />
<br />
So far I&#039;ve watched 10 episodes and at first everything is low-key, they slowly get you into the anime and by the third episode you start understanding more and more about the characters and plot. The action scenes are awesome and there is humor sparkled around plus the character relationships are !!!!<br />
<br />
What I like about it is how mysterious it is<br />
You&#039;re thrown in the middle of things so you&#039;re taken on a journey to get to know what happened as well as witnessing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367348">
        the current events. I mean up until the 10th episode and we still don&#039;t really know the true identity of the characters. Every time an episode ends, you&#039;re just left with questions and can we just?? the ending theme sooonnngg!!!<br />
<br />
overall, I think the anime really deserves a shot and I seriously dislike how some wrote a review after only watching 4 episodes......like seriously, not to mention the ranking is so unfair, do not rank it or review too soon you&#039;re giving unfair judgments

    OK this is just the impression I had after seeing 4 episodes of the show.<br />
So basically,Noblesse is the third anime adaptation of manhwa after tower of god and God of highschool and its easily the worst of the bunch.I had high hopes for noblesse with many people on the internet hyping it up and so I started the series and about 2 eps in,I saw that the MAL rating for this series is below 7 and I thought &quot;Why is it so low&quot;,It was probably too early to judge the series and I thought gradually it would rise and then 2 more episodes aired and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361883">
        with the 4th episode I had no more expectation for the series.<br />
Basically the direction of the show is one of the worst this season.The setting of the show is not that unique and I have seen several other shows do well with highschool plot with superpowered students but this show,by the 4th episode felt it was a b movie plot .It has to do with the direction as well as some of the worst voice actors in this season.Everything felt so forced to me.<br />
The soundtrack was also horrendously bad.I hated the opening as well as the ending and particularly hated the visuals of the ending.The other background music and soundtracks also did not feel like it elevated any scene.<br />
Then,The action.<br />
So,there&#039;s this action scene in episode 4 where a white haired boy fights with some mercenary and it is bad.Like really bad.<br />
Me,who was already disappointed by the direction,voice acting as well as soundtrack hoped that the series could atleast have some decent fight scene.<br />
Oh,how wrong was I.<br />
At this point continuing the series feels like a waste of time but I&#039;m still gonna watch where it goes and see whether it has any chance of redemption

    i have read the whole manga.....i loved the whole character development and arc stories they just brought enjoyment in every chapter but this anime adaption is quite the opposite...and yes i have watched the OVA also  in that OVA they cramped 84 chapters to only 25mins of epsiode... i thought this time because its a series they will stay true to their roots but i was wrong   they just getting stranded from the main source they also cut out characters  and arcs... ..in manwa their were also many funny scenes but in this adaptation there were roughly 58% added.....  by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368410">
        far this WEBTOON X CRUNCHYROLL saga is getting worse by worse this the worst manwa adaptation so far

    DISCLAIMER: THIS REVIEW IS AFTER SEEING THE FIRST 4 EPISODES AS OF OCTOBER 29 SO MY OPININON MAY HAVE CHANGED<br />
<br />
why does it seem like every episode that comes out the show keeps on getting worse and worse we saw more things in the op of the that we&#039;ve seen in 4 EPISODES yeah you heard me right 4 EPISODES But don,t get me wrong the animation is really good but if this show has the goal to lose audience after every episode than they are doing a really good job at it. So if you have a lot of times to lose then you should

    At the time I write this quick review, four episodes are out.<br />
<br />
I was pretty hyped when I saw the trailer for Noblesse. After watching the OVA and the first four episodes, it was clear that I was too much hyped. Everything seems to be cliche in this anime.<br />
<br />
The characters: you have the main one, a quiet and powerful Noble, which compensates for his lack of dialogue and his incredible strength with comical situations to fill the void (with ramen or vacuum cleaner for example). Then a nice delinquent with bleached hair and his little geek friend (with a generic voice that I can&#039;t stand) or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361878">
        Regis, a tsundere, who argue all the time with M-21. The villains are a bunch of walking cliche too.<br />
<br />
Yes. This is only the beginning of the story but how can I be excited about the next episode when everything is predictable? Still, the first few minutes of the first episode were catchy with a lively and pleasant pace but the presentation of the characters then takes too much space on the story and slows down the plot. Many of the scenes are repetitive, slow, and not very interesting. Noblesse gives me an unpleasant feeling of déjà-vu that does not bode well for the rest of the season.<br />
<br />
The art and the animation are the only good points of the anime for me. I hope it will get better but the first four episodes were disappointing.<br />
<br />
4/10.

    This show is an amazing 9/10 comedy. I was laughing so hard each episode. If, however, you don&#039;t find this show funny, then it&#039;ll immediately drop to a 2/10 or worse. This show is a train-wreck dumpster fire that my brain just interpreted as satire of yaoi-shojou-vampire anime regardless if it is or not.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t take it seriously and laugh at all the dumb sh*t that happens, you&#039;re in for a fun time. If you don&#039;t see what&#039;s on screen as funny, you&#039;re going to be miserable. There is no in between, and I&#039;m just happy I ended up in the former category.<br />
<br />
9/10 can&#039;t

    Here we are now with the third and final part of Crunchyroll’s trilogy of Manhwa/Webtoon adaptations, Noblesse. The final pillar to put Webtoon adaptations on the map. While there is no doubt they&#039;ve certainly captured people’s attention, their quality unfortunately cannot match their popularity and have been disappointments from a narrative standpoint. So I was hoping that Noblesse was able to end this trilogy on a high note but unfortunately, it ended with a silent thud to the ground.<br />
<br />
Sit back, relax and sparkle in the sunshine to wow all of the girls as I present to you the anime review for Noblesse. Let’s begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
Living

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371133">
        in isolation from humanity exists a group of powerful beings known as Nobles who exist to act as guardians for humanity. However, there is a one particular Noble who acts as the protector of said Nobles. The title for this task is called, Noblesse. This Noble is named Raizel, who has awakened from his 820-year slumber. With the help of his servant, Frankenstein, he enrols at a high school to keep himself hidden and learn more about the human world. However, when a secret organisation housing modified humans called Union and the Nobles start learning about his awakening, Raizel must use his immense powers to protect himself and those around him.<br />
<br />
Now I had the problem when starting out of not watching the Noblesse ONA titled, “Noblesse: Awakening,” beforehand. Which would have been handy after watching episode one. But anyways, onto the rest of the story, which is honestly really boring and rather incosistent. I say this because the show doesn’t seem to decide whether or not it wants to be a high school centric series or a supernatural action series. And yet both are really boring to watch because it feels like there is just no stakes nor proper growth as well as being very slow to begin with. There is no sense of tension nor drama as people after Raizel close in. There is some drama, don’t get me wrong, but it just isn’t impactful in a way to get my attention. This is mainly due to the characters not being all that engaging with meh personalities and a little bit of Raizel and Frankenstein being a little bit overpowered to make the situation less tense. Things just kind of happen with lacklustre build up to it to make the antagonists of this series a little more menacing and come across as threats that only Raizel and Frankenstein can deal with. Instead, the narrative makes them look like pushovers.<br />
<br />
But my biggest gripe is how the narrative can make the characters both important and unimportant at the same time. For example, Raizel is obviously the central character who the whole situation with Noblesse is based around. Yet he always feels like a background character and only takes centre stage when the situation needs it. He never feels like the significant character the show hypes him up to be so when he does take centre stage, it doesn’t invoke a, “Oh you’re f**ked now,” moment that this show clearly wants to portray it as. Same goes for other characters like Raizel’s school friends like Shin-Woo Han or Ik-Han Woo who act as the central figureheads for Raizel learning more about humainity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
What can you say about Raizel? Like seriously, what can you say about him? The guy has no personality to speak of and doesn’t really talk much. He doesn’t invoke a sense of emotion and mainly sits in the background letting the other characters talk. I wouldn’t necessarily mind that if HE WAS NOT THE CENTRAL MAIN CHARACTER. Considering that the majority of things happen are because of his awakening, you would think that he would take a more front row seat. But he doesn’t and he doesn’t really change while living in human society so there is no sense of picking up some human habits. Well, besides his one quirk for loving Ramen. Whereas another character like the Noble, Regis, shows some kind of growth living with humans. But not Raizel, so it was really hard to get invested into a guy who doesn’t show a lick of emotion.<br />
<br />
Now, one of my main criticisms with this show is the cast’s chemistry with one another because they don’t really have chemistry with one another. It does come across as forced most of the time as their personalities don’t bounce off one another to create some nice character moments. They’re kind of just cardboard cutouts at times talking to each other while trying to convey some emotion. The one exception I would say though is the relationship between Regis and former member of Union, M-21. They at least have chemistry with one another due to their distaste for one another slowly turning into one of trust throughout the show. It’s probably one of the good points from this show and helped make Regis and M-21 more enjoyable characters to watch compared to the rest of the cast.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast don’t share this factor with one another. Raizel’s human friends, Shin and Han, don’t gel with Raizel or the rest of the cast and act as more comic relief characters. They do get character moments of their own but they just fall by the wayside and their significance drops in the second half where they could have been pretty useful adding that innocent human element in there. Frankenstein, Raizel’s personal assistant, is alright I guess and does have an intriguing backstory about how he and Raizel first met. But that’s just it, he’s alright. Seira, another Noble, is kind of like Raizel as she has a lack of personality but with a bit more flare to it and is more upfront about things. Now, to reiterate, the characters themselves (besides Raizel) are okay but they just don’t have a sense of chemistry with one another.<br />
<br />
The antagonists are, like a said earlier, pretty much pushovers and aren’t really interesting to get me to hate them. The Union members that hunt down Raizel are a bit comical honestly and come across as a wacky Batman villains, but with none of the charm. The Nobles are more black and white but there “conflict” when it comes to their opinion on Raizel comes across really hollow because there personalities come across as really boring and don’t come across as threatening like they should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 7/10<br />
<br />
The animation is the usual Production I.G. affair. Which means it does look very polished. Their is definitely a clean look to the show which does help with some of the character designs like Raizel. But that polished look does make the action rock solid, the background art look nice and I’m a particular fan of animation effects used to demonstrate the power of some characters like Frankenstein. Again, it does have that polished look to make the animation not a concern and one of the more positive points about the show. The character designs though are a bit on the generic side and it is very clear with their designs what kind of personality they have. It may help differentiate each other but it does make them look uninspired. On a side note, does Shin remind you that he looks like a red headed version of Ichigo from Bleach?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
Looking back at the ost for this review, I was surprised at how varied it was. The ost uses a variety of instruments for both it’s atmospheric, downtime and action scenes. It doesn’t use them at the same time but uses them for it’s own separate piece to make it stand out from the others and it kind of works. It doesn’t blend into one another but rather makes them stand out in their own way. My favourite ones is whenever they use an electric guitar to make the action more ferocious.<br />
<br />
In terms of the opening, I’ve been slowly warming up to it as the show went on and has become one of my favourites this season. &quot;BREAKING DAWN&quot; by Jae Joong is a very visually solid and sounding opening that does take a bit to get into the groove of it but when it clicks is when I think it becomes an enjoyable opening. It is mainly carried by Jae Joong’s singing as the visuals themselves are nothing to write home about but the song and vocal performance just make it feel better to watch and they do match with the pace of the song. So overall, good opening that does take a bit to get into.<br />
<br />
The ending, &quot;Etoile&quot; by OH MY GIRL, is alright. It uses real life props panning to the right with a gothic feel to it. It’s is pretty cool and it has a variety of props. So it is a unique opening that I did watch not every episode but every now and then.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
Noblesse is a show that is fundamentally okay and does have a couple of positive things to it but ultimately, I was just really bored watching it. The narrative and the characters just didn’t do enough to get me invested into the narrative. My main issue is Raizel himself. I honestly think that he would have worked better as a character who was with alongside the main protagonist (while still being a main character) rather than being the main protagonist himself, because he just doesn’t work as that main protagonist and brings the whole show down honestly. It’s not that I don’t hate Noblesse as there is nothing really to hate. It’s just a meh show with some good production values and does not excel at anything really; which to be the third part of the Manhwa adaption trilogy, is not something I really wanted to say by the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
My Personal Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 4.6/10 Recommendation: Don’t Bother<br />
<br />
To wrap this review up, I just want to say how I feel about this Crunchyroll, Webtoon experiment.<br />
<br />
This whole experiment has been one of the more defining aspects of anime 2020. But the question is, has it been a success? Well from viewing standpoint, it definitely has caught people’s attention and it has been some of the most widely viewed anime this year. But from a critical standpoint, these shows have not lived up to the hype. Now I like Tower of God, but as time goes on and we still haven’t had the announcement of season 2 yet, the more sour I’m on this series because the narrative is clearly unfinished and is left on an unsatisfying note. It needs a season 2 BADLY. The God of High School is still MAPPA’s best work from an animation standpoint but the rushed story and dry characters left The God of High School as this year’s most disappointing anime. Noblesse is a very meh series with good production values but a very weak MC that brings down the whole narrative.<br />
<br />
It has become what I feared it would be and what half of anime are these days. Glorified advertisement for the source material. Unless we do get sequels, this is what they are ultimately going to be regarded as, especially Tower of God. Like is said, calling this a success or failure depends on how you are looking at this experiment. Attention wise, yes. Critically wise, no. I certainly don’t think this has been a successful venture because I mainly watch anime and if I think the anime aren’t particularly good, then getting barely 1 out of 3 right isn’t what I call a success. Tower of God was the attention grabber, The God of High School was the crowd displeaser and Noblesse was the silent thud on the ground that nobody cared about.

    First things - You will need to watch the two prequels for this to make any sense.<br />
<br />
I have been breaking this anime down weekly on Youtube and I finally feel like I can give an overall score.  I am an anime only. So will be scoring anime only.. the bottom line is - read the source material ... because there is no way this adaption has done any justice to one of the giants in the Manhwa world. I hate to say it because I wanted to like it so much, but it was boring and I don&#039;t often say that about a series.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365394">
        plot meanders... when something cool or important does actually happen...its over so quickly...  Note I love slice of life... so even if we give it a pass for being a quite arc that is light on action... it still fails as a slice of life, because it doesn&#039;t focus in on things long enough.<br />
<br />
The plot itself is something I can understand why the Manhwa  is one of the giants... You have humans/ A race of Nobles who have some pretty unique powers/ weapons and very interesting clan systems. These guys have long life spans. There is the union which perform underhanded experiments...man made humans... theres huge guns...hackers... monsters... It gave me Underworld vibes initially... the plot is full of potential <br />
<br />
So why does it not hit the mark... because its adapted poorly . Those interesting factors/ deep plot that the author has taken time to create.. isn&#039;t present. As with the other two adaptions this year... my money is on  the fact they cut a lot of content. All 3 Manhwa adaptions have suffered from cut content/ poor pacing and rushing. It shows... the plot feels thin, characters feel static, art is poor, focus shifts too much and it doesn&#039;t spend enough time building anything.<br />
<br />
This anime is ok ... Its mediocre I cant call it bad or good its neither  ... every episode - I just felt underwhelmed  and frustrated because I could see the potential they skipped or didn&#039;t spent enough time on.  The few fights we do get should have been more.<br />
 It suffers with very slow pacing. The opening episode could have been more thrilling... if they had just changed pacing. We open with a lone survivor in a jungle at night...pacing could of been slowed to really build up the moment he was hunted down. Really build it up to show the Union group of more. Show of talents, build their characters right of the bat. Instead it was rushed to jump ahead.The rest of the episode is spent on a very cliche setting in school. Showing us swooning girls over any male character... not even delving into aspects that could make the school setting entertaining to watch. School anime isn&#039;t my usual preference.... but this anime just makes it boring... the school doesn&#039;t feel lively/real the rest of the class often serves as stills... they are nameless.. I cant even recall if they have a teacher haha.<br />
<br />
Yuu and Manabu were given the main focus for a bit and the anime did an ok job developing them both. But then they shelved them to rush ahead.  <br />
<br />
My biggest problem with the anime is the characters... Fair play the anime wants to do a slow reveal on the mains. But everything comes across as flat...Characters don&#039;t feel deep or well written... they feel 2 dimensional.The anime hasn&#039;t taken time to develop characters bar the basics. They did a fair job at developing M-21... and slowly the relationships between some of the characters ... but it was done in a snail paced manner. And then rushed ahead when they were doing the character building. M-21&#039;s character is full of potential to be interesting... a created human who has to find a meaning for his life now he has been dis guarded by the union who made him. Plenty of room to bring in a philosophical angle. And really push what it means to be human.<br />
 <br />
The main character is very reserved and this can be fine, but you dont see him do anything until episode 5... He may as well not be in the anime up until then because the character is drained of anything that makes him interesting. We spend more time following from Yuus point of view in some episodes that it felt like he was more the main. <br />
 <br />
The group who serve as antagonists for the first half of the season are watered down and rushed. The members they want to be evil...are just simple evil bad for the sake of it. Shark likes killing people because.  Hammer is gluttony from FMA. He clearly has a well written backstory with powers and a really interesting weapon.. but we see him wiped out so fast it doesn&#039;t matter. There is a point where he breaks logic and manifests characters out of thin air. Which I blame cut content on.<br />
The anime really wants to build Krantz up to be our big bad for the first half .... but it fails to hit the mark. By the time we hit a face off with Raz and him .,..which is over in about a minute.  Krantz barely has screen time. So when it came down to the fight between yes two characters who had barely any screen time... it wasn&#039;t impactful. I don&#039;t hate Krantz enough to care ... and Raz has barely been present that I don&#039;t actively cheer him on or worry about his safety. <br />
<br />
The art in the Manhwa is stunning... the anime... not so much ... theres a lot of times where things look blurred... the animation is not great. Some of the screenshots from the fights look awful. Which really is a shame because when I was debating watching it initally the art was something I was tricked by. Where Tower of Gods Manhwa art was improved in its adaption... this is the sad opposite where that beautiful art is demoted. You simply have to type in Frankenstein or Raziel and see the beautiful art work for them to understand.<br />
<br />
Things have started to get interesting and some world building and plot is being developed but ... its episode 8 .... its a little to late. There are 4 episodes left to come to some form of ending.  <br />
<br />
There are many better school animes/ slice of lifes/ action based animes out there to watch. Who do a much better job on all fronts. I really think if you want to give Noblesse a shot... just pick up the Manhwa.<br />
<br />

    I dont understand why studios invest money to make such a poor show.<br />
the animation is terrible. it looks like it was taken straight from the 2000s<br />
but with no style. just a bland looking old school animation.<br />
<br />
the story so far from the first 5 episodes is boring. <br />
and the starting point of the show is soo off. even after watching the ova i feel no connection to this world and it seems like too much was skipped.<br />
<br />
the action is forgettable.<br />
the music is forgettable<br />
<br />
All that i can hope is that this adaptation wont affect other manhwa adaptations.<br />
I really liked tower of god and even enjoyed Goh to

    Ahhh such a shame. I&#039;m sure people who haven&#039;t read the manhwa (Korean version of manga) you may be tired of the people who have crying about it not living up to, or missing large parts of the original story.<br />
<br />
Well I wont discuss the missing story, that has been covered by others, plus I don&#039;t think its all too bad. However my reason for giving this anime adaptation such a low score is the very poor way it showed the fundamental events which it did include. This was especially apparent in the final few episodes. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! <br />
<br />
The final few episodes covered the event

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371015">
        which was meant to show Raskreia receiving some much needed guidance (even though she is not aware in the beginning) from Gejutel and then Raizel himself. This whole event was wrecked by the anime which means that one of the first defining moments in the Noblesse story was wrecked. The Gejutel&#039;s &#039;tough love&#039; from the manhwa was turned into a simple &#039;I failed to educate you&#039; let-down of a speech. Rai&#039;s iconic blood field back and forth with Raskreia was turned into a bulls**t lackluster fight scene between him, the Lord and the elders. Rai then almost faints (WTF!!!) he bleeds from the eyes and mouth which tugs at our heart strings but my boy stands strong and doesn&#039;t faint!!!! And then the previous Lord explaining why we made the offer he did to Raizel (not gonna say what as I&#039;m really trying to be as spoiler light as I can) so that Raskreia can understand her fathers true wish for her, where the f*** was that whole scene?! poof gone. This also has the unfortunate effect of making the characters involved feel much shallower, crybaby Raskreia now, great. There were many other scenes I could pick apart in much the same way (like the Frankenstein and Rajak fight and appearance in the sanctuary) but I&#039;ll leave it. What I&#039;ve written should hopefully be enough to explain my viewpoint. <br />

So to those who haven&#039;t read the Manhwa and have enjoyed your introduction into the Noblesse world through this anime, if you enjoyed it then thats fantastic, truly. I would say that if you ever get the chance to read even just the sanctuary scene in the manhwa, you should! It will give you a much better look at the Rai/Previous Lord/Raskreia dynamic. Even if your not a big manhwa reader, if your loving this story, you owe it to yourself to at least read up this scene as it should have been.
