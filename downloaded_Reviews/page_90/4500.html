        share his passion (or not): the popular Karen Tendo (who is beautiful and likes to play video games), the ikemen Uehara (big lol) with his girlfriend Aguri (aka &quot;gal&quot;) and Chiaki Hoshinomori, a secluded and shy girl who plays video games and who will often quarrel with Keita Amano because they will have slightly different tastes.<br />
<br />
 (Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes - the big spoilers will be specified: *big spoiler*)<br />
<br />
All that Keita Amano says and does makes me cringe. He does not agree with Karen Tendo because he thinks he must play by having fun and not being competitive. The idea does not even come to mind that he could do both as well. Have fun and be competitive and I&#039;m sure a lot of people prefer to play in this way. If you play without interest to win or play correctly, then this means more a lack of self-confidence that you will voluntarily ignore. Gradually, talking with Tendo Karen (who mainly plays by being competitive), Keita Amano will review her judgment and incidentally fall in love.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Amano doesn&#039;t understand love relationships. He thinks that life happens as in visual novels and as a result he will train to understand girls through visual novels. But what an absurd idea! life and games have nothing to do (what Uehara will point out to him). I complain when I see this type of behavior because the anime portrays a negative image of the otaku gamer, assuming that he only lives in 2D and is unable to understand anything to real life. I understand that it is a comedy but surprisingly the anime tries to give a more serious tone in these moments.<br />
<br />
(By the way, let&#039;s also point out that Keita Amano buys at cost price his video games in shops and never on the Internet.)<br />
<br />
The other male protagonist is Uehara. A high school student who has a lot of friends and a girlfriend called Aguri. He doesn&#039;t care so much about his girlfriend and often forgets her. He is more interested in Keita Amano (Is he gay?) because he saw that this unpopular guy was discussing with Karen Tendo and that the latter had a fit when Keita refused to register for the club. He tries to become a friend with Keita and helps him find a girlfriend who also plays video games. So he suggests that Keita talk to Chiaki. The latter proves to be (surprise ! surprise !) Keita&#039;s only friend because they have already met on a mobile game. But the two concerned don&#039;t know. Obviously Uehara, satisfied to hear this news (without the other two being aware) would like them to go out together.<br />
<br />
He thinks that Keita and Chiaki can live as a couple because they both love video games. Sorry? It&#039;s completely stupid. Such a couple is completely improbable. It is not because you have a common passion that everything will go well for the rest of your life as a couple. This type of relationship is completely fragile and has no future.<br />
<br />
Regarding the female characters, I appreciate them although they are not coherent. Aguri is a girl who goes out with Uehara but becomes jealous because she sees Uehara with Chiaki and suspects him of going out with Tendo as well. Karen Tendo is a very popular girl who wants Keita to join her video games club. Surprisingly, the anime seems to assume from the first episodes that gamers do not have many friends and often feel isolated as we can see with Keita and Chiaki but not with Tendo. I don&#039;t know if the passion of Tendo is secret but if it is the case, it is improbable since the club of video games seems quite visible and that some people are already in this club. Following Keita&#039;s refusal, Tendo gradually falls in love with Keita and follows him like a stalker. She will try to get closer and they will go out together. Why is she interested in Keita while receiving daily declarations of love from other boys? Do not ask me, it&#039;s a mystery.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it&#039;s hard for me to describe the characters more, because their personality is inconsistent. It evolves according to the needs of the scenario. If Karen Tendo is to react as a tsundere at a specific time, she will. If Uehara is to behave like a fool by gesticulating stupidly, he will. If Aguri must be angry with her boyfriend (Uehara) because she has seen him with another girl, she will either do it or not. Only the scenario decides. The characters do not behave logically. The characters are deliberately stupid and this facilitates all the more the setting up of the misunderstandings in the plot.<br />
<br />
And thus all misunderstandings are based on random reactions of the characters. They don&#039;t try to think much longer about their situation, their real relationship with their boyfriend or girlfriend. They only believe what they see and it&#039;s insane. If tomorrow I see my girlfriend walking with another man, I won&#039;t directly assume she&#039;s unfaithful, right? But it&#039;s different for Gamers&#039; characters. Two or three coincidences are enough so that the character feels betrayed. At no time do the characters really decide to reason and go quietly to discuss with their partner to understand what is really going on. They try to get together to play a ridiculous board game that plays even more with their relationships but do nothing concrete to correct misunderstandings.<br />
<br />
The relations between the characters aren&#039;t interesting and illogical too. For example, Aguri and Amano will initially ally to know if Uehara actually goes out with Chiaki because they accidentally saw them together once. And to complete the misunderstanding, Chiaki and Uehara think that Aguri and Amano love each other because they happened to see them together in the restaurant. Meanwhile, Amano and Uehara continue to see each other at school without asking a single question, while if at least one of them tries to approach the subject, misunderstandings could have been solved more quickly. So everything is good to continue the same insipid and repetitive comedy. Like manzai gags we can see in the shounen mangas.<br />
<br />
*Big spoiler*<br />
Later, these misunderstandings will create a love triangle. Chiaki aka Mono (her username in the mobile game) hears that Keita is her best friend who has supported her creations from the beginning. Keita doesn&#039;t know the true identity of Mono. And because plot-convenience, Chiaki says that her little sister is Mono. (I wonder how she could convince her sister) But Keita doesn&#039;t notice the lie. Even if he is a little suspicious, he doesn&#039;t try to make the connection between Mono and Chiaki, not once. And so begins our dramatic romance with Chiaki who begins to regret seeing Keita go out with Tendo while she did everything to stop Keita from knowing her identity. She is shy but at one point I wonder why she decides not to reveal anything to Keita. Why suffer so much?<br />
As for the Aguri-Uehara couple, it is present only to increase the number of misunderstandings. There is no development in their unstable relationship but obviously no one wants to break despite the lack of trust between the two characters. I pity this poor Aguri frankly because her boyfriend seems to be totally disinterested in her. Actually I almost never saw this couple act like a couple.<br />
*End big spoiler<br />
<br />
The animation seems cheap. Anyway, I had low expectations of the studio Pine Jam, known for two other lamentable works: one with a magical girl for lolicons and the other with a high school girl who seduces a salaryman because boobs. Overall the faces are drawn roughly and the colors are close to what you can see using paint. The opening sounds like a disgusting mixture of generic J-pop with noisy seiyuu. Where are the great performances of excellent seiyuu like Nao Touyama or Rie Takahashi? I thought the Japanese were taking this profession more seriously than in the West but apparently the level is falling in Japan.<br />
<br />
Eventually Gamers! didn&#039;t try to build romances, trying to give a more interesting place for video games. You can find some references on popular games, whether it is the games that the characters play or the comic scenes where the characters run or make choices such as a visual novel. It was entertaining, nothing exceptional either. Gamers! doesn&#039;t really deal with interesting themes such as the place of video games in society or the impact of video games on the characters&#039; daily lives. A series like New Game! is more interesting at this level. I expected at least a series like Genshiken who shows us (comically, I admit) the routine of the otakus. Don&#039;t waste your time on this series and watch something that can actually satisfy you, for example Made in Abyss if you choose a seasonal show.

    First review, but I felt like some of this needed to be said and I felt I&#039;ve seen enough.<br />
This does contain some spoilers, I suppose. <br />
<br />
Gamers has a cool premise: modern gaming, where there&#039;s a school club for it and the leader is a popular and pretty blonde girl who tries to find other gamers and recruit them - but the main lead says no to joining!<br />
<br />
The first few episodes seemed pretty decent and I was enjoying the show. After a few episodes, things got really frustrating. The show steered away from video games and gaming culture for the most part and turned into an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256108">
        extremely petty and frustrating love drama between the characters. They are all suspicious of each other liking someone else and instead of, y&#039;know, just talking to each other and actually communicating, they have obscured POVs and do petty things to find out if their hunch is right, and, without actual proof, they draw conclusions over the dumbest and simplest things. I thought it would all stick to one, maybe two episodes, but it went on longer than it should have and is still going.<br />
<br />
I tried to give it a chance after a couple of bad episodes. I was really excited to watch it and thought it was really cute and enjoyable at first, but the plot just went completely downhill the last few episodes that it became unwatchable. I am only being this hard on it since it&#039;s a 12 episode anime. That&#039;s short, and if you have several bad episodes within that.. that really takes the quality down several notches. <br />
Instead of the characters developing, it&#039;s as if it&#039;s the characters just became worse - and not in an interesting way either. They went from pretty cool, smart characters to all of them just making piss poor decisions and failing so hard at communicating that it was cringe-worthy. <br />
<br />
I understand that every plot has at least one conflict, but the kind of conflict they went with is very poor, annoying, and unfitting for what the show could/should have been about. There&#039;s so much they could have done with this show but instead of sticking to the show&#039;s actual theme, they chose to plop in a bunch of negative, unnecessary love drama.. with the odd video game reference here and there to remind you of the title, I guess.<br />
<br />
It&#039;d be nice if the plot picked up again and became more about gaming again, but I couldn&#039;t stand to stick around. I understand one of the themes of this anime is romance as well, which is fine, but the fact that they made all the characters so painfully stupid and oblivious is extremely unrealistic - even for naive highschoolers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than my disappointment for the plot (so far) and character development (or lack there-of/character decline), the music is decent. The opening is adorable, and the animation itself is decent.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If the show does improve, I&#039;ll be happy, but its annoying fall-off in the middle (so far, anyway) is too frustrating to endure for me and seems to steer away from the original premise of what was making the show so charming.

    Gamers is honestly a show that made me scratch my head more than I realized. As a gamer myself, this anime really feels relatable at heart on occasions because of its concepts. However, what really follows is a rough adaptation that translated into a questionable story. It ended up being an anime that I can’t fully say it’s appreciable for what it had to offer. And that’s too bad really.<br />
<br />
Based on the light novel of the same name, Gamers stood out as an anime at first for me just by its title and it seemed like a show that I felt comfortable with. However, what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258954">
        this series actually presents is far more just about gamers gathering together to play games. It became a show with romance themes, misunderstandings, and drama shenanigans that really took relationships to a strange level. On paper, the show’s premise sounds pretty simple as main male protagonist Keita Amano is invited by the prettiest girl of the school Karen, to join her video game club. What follows is a string of misunderstandings that ended up being messy.<br />
<br />
Let’s get the obvious elephant in the room out of the way. Gamers is not recommendable if you have an obvious dislike for rom-com. From the very start, it’s pretty straightforward as the anime jumps right into the main picture with the characters and their roles. Karen is a character that I found to be easy to accept as she is friendly and simple to get along with. What might rub people in the wrong way is her obsession with video games and more so, her obsession with Amano. The anime makes it clear that she likes Amano and extends beyond just the idea of video games. For Amano himself, it seems he has a mutual attraction towards Karen although has a hard time to confess the truth. Unlike Karen, he’s also more timid and unpopular at school. Drama follows the both of them as ship teases begins to develop between various characters. <br />
<br />
Beyond Amano and Karen, we also got Aguri and Tasuku, a couple with very sociable personalities. They bring in the comedic drama as misunderstandings are often created by plot circumstances and their own personal delusions. Individually, Aguri is also quite an energetic character with a friendly personality. Similarly, Tasuku finds himself easy to make friends with others and very outgoing. Both of their live are intersected with Karen and Amano as the story picks up and they get involved in drama and the misunderstandings. For me, this shows draws and sells its humor through the misunderstandings. Unfortunately, I can’t really say the anime’s plot work overall from this formula. It’s very formulaic and predictable as almost every episode feels the same. You may think there are developments between the main characters but in reality, the anime doesn’t do a clever job at progressing the plot. While I appreciate how the anime tries to sell its comedy with character pairings, it’s really no different in the end with plot resolutions. Beyond the humor, there is some actual drama if you count Chiaki’s role in the show. The character chemistry between her and Amano occasionally has more emotions although is still often downplayed quickly because of how lighthearted this anime is. Surprisingly, I found her sister to be more likable as she seems like a fun person to hang out with and talk to. The sibling relationship Hoshinomori is surprisingly realistic as the two can be easily relatable by their roles in this show.<br />
<br />
If you’re a fan of video games, you’ll notice a lot of references. These range from console games, PC gaming, dating sims, and even arcade games. Thanks to these ideas, I think some people may find this anime likable even with the lackluster plot. The idea of gaming is explored with social norms and relatable with the main characters. However, do realize that the anime is very lighthearted and doesn’t really take a serious approach at exploring the cultural ideas of gaming. It’s more of an anime that deals with comedic relationship pairings in order to draw out a casual audience. The lack of background storytelling (with exception of Tasuku and Aguri) also holds this anime back at times. To me, Gamers is an anime that’s easy to accept but hard to embrace.<br />

Adapted by Pine Jam, this anime originally had my worries due to its lack of promotions. More importantly, their previous project was pretty unnoticeable for its technical quality. However, my worries quickly died down after seeing the first few episodes. It’s not at a level that will make your jaws drop but definitely consistent for a light novel adaptation. What really draws the audience into the technical quality is perhaps the character expressions. The biggest sell of this show is the humor so it’s important to capture those expressions. Thankfully, I found myself laughing on occasions when characters react as result of misunderstandings, drama, and other shenanigans. The character designs themselves are also appealing enough to make them stand out; except with the case of Amano as he looks like a generic Average Joe. Unfortunately, this anime doesn’t escape the fan service pit so expect some episodes to have it with suggestive camera angles and swimsuits.<br />
<br />
As a lighthearted anime like Gamers, the theme songs aren’t particular noticeable until you realize their style. While it’s not truly avant-garde, it does take an approach that will make the audience talk about especially with its catchy OP song. The gaming references extends to its soundtrack elements as it sometimes uses a similar style for its OST. Still, character voice mannerism is rather moderate as none of them really stand out. Aguri’s accent also took me some time to get used to as she sounds like a kid at times. <br />
<br />
Should you watch Gamers? Honestly, it really depends but the anime felt more like a big ship tease rather than an appealing show of sharp writing. The comedy is the main selling factor so if humor is your cup of tea, then this anime will be one that you’ll remember that by. As for the storytelling? It really doesn’t do any favors when the show is like a loop that doesn’t progress the main plot altogether. The anime itself is also an incomplete adaptation as the novels are ongoing. So in essence, it’s rather open ended. For gamers and anime fans, this show is fun to watch when you’re bored and need time to pass by. But for what it really delivered, it’s an anime that I found face palming myself more than laughing.<br />

    What is the meaning of gamer? If we go to our favorite culture dictionary, we will consider a gamer someone that plays video-games. Is it the main topic of this anime? Sadly, it isn&#039;t. The video-game idea is irrelevant here unless that we associate the game concept with a relationship. In that case, we can say that the plot of this anime is a relationship game and a &quot;gamer&quot; interprets, acts, and plays on that relationship game. The goal of the game could be ending with someone, maybe love, etc. <br />
<br />
I can give several convenient titles for this anime, &quot;Misunderstandings,&quot; &quot;The mess,&quot; &quot;Mistakes,&quot; &quot;Misconceptions.&quot; All

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258957">
        these titles point to the same problems in a relationship and how messy a relationship can be. It would be wrong waiting to see a full-time anime about &quot;video-games,&quot; tournaments, and more video-games. If you just watch this anime for that reason, you will receive a big blow on your face, you will lose all your health points, and you will end very disappointed with a big question ¿And the games?<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Relationships are complicated and love ones are even worse. How many times have we seen an anime about them? If you answer just this one, I will call you Pinocchio. This anime created some relationships from a simple topic the &quot;video-games.&quot; The characters have something in common, video-games or persons that played them. These characters will try harder to find more about other players because they have THAT something in common (games). That&#039;s the main story of this anime. Keita the typical gaming freak meets another gaming freak called Karen. Call it destiny, cliché, lack of argument she felt something for Keita. For me, both them are the first gamers. The goal is that they end together. During this adventure, other &quot;gamers&quot; joined this messy match and added chaos with some alternative endings. For example, Keita should end with Chiaki, etc. All this mess is titled &quot;Gamers!&quot; an amusing comedy with funny moments and some frustrating events but enjoyable at the end. <br />
<br />
I know, Gamers&#039; story isn&#039;t that amazing. After the half of the series, we can consider it average and repetitive. Also, several persons expressed unsatisfaction of the same misunderstanding recycling and how it only gets worse. From my perspective, that is the main argument of the series if you remove this &quot;mess&quot; we will end with an empty casket that would talk about video-games, a gaming club but won&#039;t be an enjoyable comedy. Besides, no matter if the argument is repetitive we can associate it to the insecurity found in every relationship.  They are average students without any relationship experience, they will make several mistakes and will tend to overthink everything. <br />
<br />
Characters 7/10<br />
We have five main characters. They share the ability to mistake relationships from bad judgment. They don&#039;t have any love experience. They will overlook every decision for that reason all ends in chaos. <br />
<br />
Keita Amano, the conventional freak. We can see him as a zero at the left. None notice about him and he lives in a gaming world. Insecure, shy, but cares for his new friends. <br />
<br />
Tendou Karen, the freakish idol. She is a beautiful face, desired student, popular, and with a hidden gaming addiction. From a relationship perspective, she is very insecure and timid.  <br />
<br />
Chiaki Hoshinomori, the last freak. We can consider her a secondary freak. She is similar to Keita, they like the same and do the same, but they have several differences when they talk about games. She also is the last acting.<br />
<br />
Tasuku Uehara, the ex-freak. A reformed &quot;Keita.&quot; He was like Keita but changed and became popular. He wants to help Keita, but he overthinks everything and ends creating a bigger mess. <br />
<br />
Aguri, the insecure lover or better the ex-freak lover. She has a particular personality, but she is very uncertain of her relationship and sees a cheating ghost every time. Even if she doesn&#039;t like games, she enjoys being around gamers.  <br />
<br />
All these characters have a twisted insecurity that keeps adding gasoline to the fire but thanks to that we can see some hilarious moments. Sometimes we want to hit the screen with our head but overall the moments are good. <br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
The art isn&#039;t that amazing, and there are some angles where we can see some ugly spots or weird faces. In general, the art is acceptable. They focus on the characters, their faces, and details to create an impact on the expressions depending on the situation. The palette is the same most of the time as the lighting model, so they used a bright light with a pastel combined palette. In general, the art is acceptable for a comedy.     <br />
<br />
Sound 8/10 <br />
The sound mix helps on the situations and adds tension when needed but also focus on the awkward moments, so it helps with the plot and levels the climax. The OP and ED are good, I loved more the ED, but both are very catchy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10<br />
No matter if the problems are repetitive the show offers several hilarious scenes. The insecurity of this group is presented to the audience with a combination between mess and comedy. This concept works well with the storytelling, a good pacing, and produces a twisted love comedy that we will enjoy. <br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Finally, I want to apologize. I overused the word &quot;GAME&quot; maybe you are exhausted from it, but I am sure this simple messy story will bring a smile on your face. It isn&#039;t the best comedy out there, but it is acceptable. The characters have their moments, and their insecurity is used to create some epic events. I am sure that you will enjoy some of them. Give it a try.  <br />

    Typically I can&#039;t even decide if I&#039;ll like an anime after just 4 episodes but this time I NEED to write this review in order to persuade people into watching this.<br />
<br />
So, first time I saw this I was convinced it&#039;s some kind of copy of &quot;Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?&quot;. They&#039;re both basically about the same thing (slice of life in a video game club) but their execution is way different.<br />
<br />
This anime basically completes netoge in some areas and it seems to explore the social aspect of video game geeks. At the same time, it seems to be a manifesto for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254599">
        playing games the fun way. Nowadays, with the popularization of eSports a lot of people have started to play games in a competitive manner that, in my and apparently this anime&#039;s opinion, spoils the fun.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a sucker for good romcoms that don&#039;t have a linear, boring  boy-meets-girl-they-fall-in-love-funny-stuff-happens, and this seems to hit the right spot. It&#039;s kinda underrated in my opinion, but it can be argued that this anime formula is already overused. Still, I believe it&#039;s worth your time.<br />
<br />
DEFINITELY give this a try.

    Gamers! is a bog-standard, uninspired romance-comedy anime that tries nothing new and fails at every stride it takes, not to mention its offensively bad representation of the gaming community.<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
Have you watched a rom-com anime before? If you answered yes, then there is no need for you to watch this show. It&#039;s your generic story of a loser, socially awkward MC that gets attention from the hottest girls in his school for no apparent reason. The relationship webs between characters are poorly done and only arise because the characters are too stupid to make logical decisions when it comes to their relationships. Ultimately, it fails

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255873">
        in making the connection between these realistic, therefore defeating one of the main purposes of a rom-com.... the romance. <br />
<br />
Oh and about the comedy, it&#039;s awful. The only time I laughed while watching this show was at myself after a joke I made about one of the characters playing a what was essentially CS:GO. The comedic timing is way off and characters have no gimmicks to play off of one another.<br />
<br />
Art: 3<br />
Think anime. Think anime protagonist. Now you know what our main character looks like. Character designs are bland, boring and just plain bad. However the animation itself is good and the intro has great animation featuring the main characters as if they were inside various types of games.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Nothing special, background music fits the tone of situations well and the intro and ending are decent. Nothing much more to say.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1<br />
This is where the show is most insulting. Not only are the characters generic, underdeveloped, having no rhyme or reason as to why they like the other characters, but the misrepresentation of gamers is what really ruins the charters. You will not find a single gamer in this world that is anything like most of the main cast. They are gamers for the sake of the plot and are given no reason as to why they started playing video games in the first place, which could have given a nice conflict in ideologies which the show tried to do... yet failed.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2<br />
There&#039;s not much to like at all about this show, if you have seen one rom-com anime, you&#039;ve seen Gamers!. Do not bother watching, I&#039;ve done the dirty work for you in order to write this review.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2<br />
---DO NOT WATCH---<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED<br />

    Gamers is about games, but on a broad spectrum it would be gigantic around parts where we see geek culture in general as a style of advertising, but none of it really has any evolutionary demonstration and becomes just pure advertising. So, what we&#039;re left with is a controversial premise that maybe worked out, not being a controversial premise, which makes a break of premise not being about games but a romantic comedy, that what was left in the end was just popularity, sales of material , generating profit from advertisements and for the public, something similar to 5 teenagers in a kind of apprehensive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404594">
        psychological game of hits and back to see who loves who, filled with decisions and indecisions, making everything a torturous mess and with that we have the rest Cast: 1 existing character with little role, 1 half-existing character with no role, and another 4 characters (listed in the MAL) that are non-existent and no role.<br />
<br />
Gamers starts with our main character Amano Keita, an introverted teenager and a gaming junkie (and maybe geek culture in general) who supposedly knows our beauty named Tendou Karen, a gaming club leader (and maybe a geek culture fan too in general) and self-declared as &quot;the prettiest girl in school&quot; to the public - which is a typical cliché, invites him to join her club, is rejected by an attitude of fear (which demonstrates introversion and what in a way it fits right into the character), and as a result, she automatically falls in love with him, yes, deep down Karen is that kind of person who had the wrong glimpse of an introvert and understood this attitude as aggressive, and that for many times throughout the plot despises him for being a wimp. On the other hand, Amano didn&#039;t seem to give Karen back as much of his feelings and rather tends to repeat more about her beauty, since as she&#039;s popular, he wouldn&#039;t have a chance of anything with her, in short, - the recluse who attacks himself for be a weakling.<br />
<br />
Among them are Uehara Tasuku, Aguri (Aguri) and Hoshinomori Chiaki.<br />
<br />
Tasuku is Amano&#039;s friend and probably his faithful advisor, whom Amano respects for being more &quot;mature&quot; for having a girlfriend, and Tasuku knows Amano&#039;s personality and struggles and really acts as an advisor on how to relate to Karen. Tasuku is perhaps the best character in this work, because the voices of thoughts we hear the most is his, and also because the whole &quot;roll&quot; was created by him, so, in a way, he is a wise and intelligent guy.<br />
<br />
Aguri is Tasuku&#039;s girlfriend and loves him with all his strength, while Tasuku is a character who on this occasion does not seem to show so many true feelings and has a style more to &quot;disinterested&quot; or better, &quot;I don&#039;t care&quot;, but still seem like a perfect match and their relationship is legally exploited.<br />
<br />
Chiaki is literally the clone of Amano female version, both in looks and a similar personality.<br />
<br />
She is an introvert like him and also a &quot;gamer&quot;, and knowing each other, they have time together playing (little) and sharing thoughts about. (little)<br />
<br />
What little we know about her is that she obviously falls in love with Amano and is jealous of him with Karen and Karen follows that same line.<br />
<br />
Chiaki has a sister named Hoshinomori Konoha and I don&#039;t remember many details about her, but I know that when she enters the plot there is no absolute meaning or why in the quintet&#039;s relationship, it&#039;s just manure.<br />
<br />
There is a character named Eiichi Misumi who was one of the members of the club and didn&#039;t have a history, besides appearing a few times after the start for about milliseconds as one of them being in something like a commercial alongside a girl named Riki Misumi. Nothing about the two and the rest of the cast makes sense, and if it was for some grace, I&#039;m sorry but don&#039;t laugh at &quot;nonsensetlk inexistent char&quot;.<br />
<br />
Oiso Nina is a character who appeared at the beginning of the game club playing any game, and then disappears and doesn&#039;t appear anymore. Neither we nor they know who she is in all of this.<br />
<br />
Much less about a guy named Kase Gakuto (never seen) and Sarina (no photo in MAL).<br />
<br />
Well, according to the way I explained the situation, it&#039;s basically a similar follow-up where the problems unfold, or rather, &quot;roll up&quot;.<br />
<br />
From the background to this psychological apprehension of the characters, we have Tasuku and Aguri (I won&#039;t comment on their case, as they are basically already complete) who are at the top of this scheme involving support for a resolution in the relationship between Amano, Karen and Chiaki. One is in favor of one and against the other while the other is against one and helping the other - the chronology goes something like this but I don&#039;t remember details unfortunately, but it becomes a mess involving glances, notes, sms, even games and board games and etc... which led us to a meaningless conclusion that returns to square one, as if it had started all over again and we had watched absolute nothingness (watch backwards and you won&#039;t see a difference) with very little development, zero productivity and many repetitions in dialogues, scenarios and actions.<br />
<br />
Does everything seem alright so far? yes, but follow the details:<br />
<br />
All characters in this plot are teenagers who are at school, and they act childish and are fussy, noisy and complaining, which is normal and coincides with the content and their alternative personalities of each one, but takes away all the pleasure that could be acquired out the rest of the problems.<br />
<br />
Gamers is not funny, there are no jokes, just crying, it has an ugly design and it is really annoying and annoying, but at the same time it is nice to watch at certain times, it has a beautiful coloring, nice characters (only 4, half a point for Chiaki and the rest be damned), contagious music and competent direction, and because of that it can divide opinions among the public not only by taste (including adult-child), but also by internal configurations, but also by age (childish).<br />
<br />
In my case it was half taste, mostly CI and age I rule out.<br />
<br />
I recommend Gamers to kids or maybe a little bit above that for lack of critical logic and obviously it will contain more fun for them than it will for adults, so if you&#039;re an adult and you&#039;re looking for fun, your place is not here.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and see you next time.

Funny enough ‘Gamers’ is NOT an anime about Games, rather it’s an anime about the people who play Games! The show is more a Slice of life Romcom about teenagers where the story just focuses on their lives at High school and their interactions with one other which may disappoint some viewers due to its Soap Opera-ish vibe. (If you are looking for something similar but with more gaming involved, check out ‘Netoge No Yome Wa Onnanoko Ja Nai To Omotta?’) I too was upset upon learning this, but the anime brilliantly defends itself by delivering spontaneously strong, albeit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262119">
        sometimes cliched Comedy! By not resorting to a Harem anime like everybody else, it’s a breath of fresh air to have 2 main guys rather than 1 and all girls. The 1st episode itself foreshadows uniqueness as the show deliberately sets up a Generic Romcom setting where the MC is invited to a Gaming club by a beautiful girl and the other characters presented clearly looked like the shows main cast. Only to swerve all of us towards the end by having the MC be like ‘Nah, this isn’t for me’! Realizing the show had the balls to create a ‘fake cast’ of characters just for 1 Joke meant I was in store for something Awesome! And I wasn’t disappointed! Another thing I liked was the shows effort of making fun of the Harem genre itself. We actually have a character who calls upon this in one episode! The same character even plots to force a Harem on one of the MC’s which ended up rebounding horribly! ‘Gamers’ uses an old exaggeration of an over the top love triangles which gets everyone confused and misinformed, thus resulting into utter chaos! (The show bravely points it out to us from time to time) You have things like characters hearing only the worst parts of a conversations to someone suppressing important info just to protect another character’s public image which may look frustrating, but it was fantastically executed!<br />
<br />
All the characters are genuinely interesting by managing to stand out via their personalities. We have our simple looking Amano, who’s very bad when it comes to judgements due to his uncertainties. Nevertheless, he’s a good MC since he’s peculiarly zealous about certain type of games and will fight ‘’verbally’’ tooth and nails to defend his point despite sucking at playing games! He manages to come across very kind to others and it’s his infectious passion for games that resulted into Tendou falling head over heels for him! Tendou herself is a big gaming fan (in secret) so others simply can’t understand her infatuation for Amano which results into Tendou losing her ‘Highschool Dream Girl’ image. (Being REJECTED by a Nobody really hurt her image at school!) Even though she doesn’t do much later, her depiction of a major crush was humourlessly presented to us which never got tiring. After all this is how a person with a real crush acts! The person goes through unstable amount of emotions without ever expressing it out loud. Uehara is another character who comes off looking cool but isn’t as smart as he thinks! Often a prey to his own schemes due to bad decisions, results in being the root for the whole group problems! Aguri bonds nicely with Amano and she’s all cute and innocent while Chiaki turns out to be even a bigger Gaming nerd than the MC himself! I liked how her story went along with the main arc and whenever she said ‘Desu Desu’. These 5 characters provide us with the bulk of relatable Comedy in a hilarious and ridiculous manner that will have you LOLing pretty hard! <br />
<br />
Animation is pretty basic, though colourful and the character designs are by the numbers. Both the OP and ED were a stand out with very catchy music and bright visuals which is appreciated with great Voice Acting from the cast for both Subs and Dubs. The opening video boasts wonderful ingenuity by showcasing countless parodies of video games like Mario and Street Fighter and the work done on facial expressions were superb!  <br />
<br />
Despite its flaws, I found the anime funny and entertaining. Episode 5, now remembered as ‘The Mother of All Misunderstandings!’ was hands down the best episode the anime has to offer as it managed to deliver a perfect storm of emotions ranging from Jealousy, Love, Envy, Confusion, Shock, etc in a Comedic fashion! (I loved how the MC was totally oblivious to all it!) This reminds me of a movie called ‘Crazy, Stupid, Love’ which pulled of a similar scene of misinterpretations by Comedic means. But exactly like the movie, this brilliant plot unravelled too quickly as the anime failed to entertain us on this level again! The anime tries to repeat itself with the follow up of a Board game, but it just didn’t have the same kick to it! And add in the pretty Meh ending, hurts your final thoughts about the show. Still the characters had their own side plots which were nicely demonstrated though the interactions between them remained the highlight of this anime. Certainly, recommend it to everyone as it’s one of the good anime of this year!

    &quot;Missunderstandings&quot; everywhere. You could basically sum up the whole show with these two words. To cut to the chase, the characters are really bad and 1-dimensional. This was one of many griping issues that was bugging me while watching this show; the characters are all dumb/intentionally idiotic (and I don’t mean this lightly), and the cast consists of your run-of-the-mill cliche character tropes you’ll find in any romcom anime. You’ll have your &quot;wimpy loser MC” who is voiced by your average female shounen VA, the &quot;prettiest girl in class that has a crush on the wimpy MC” cause for SOME REASON wimps are chick magnets,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255158">
        the &quot;annoying girl with the annoying voice&quot; (you’ll know which one), the &quot;dude that is really popular but likes to hangout with loser MC&quot;, and the list goes on. <br />
<br />
To add on top of the lame cast, the show never seems to go anywhere. The only thing that seems to be driving the plot forward would be the “misunderstandings” that would occur between two of the characters. This misunderstand could be anything: Character A was caught being close to Character B, Character B shares a drink with Character C and Character A sees this and is surprised that B and C are close (even though in reality it was mutual and not in a way of showing lovely emotions towards each other), Character C thinks Character A hate them thus undergoes depression, THE LOST GOES ON AND IT’S ANNOYING! The whole foundation of the plot in Gamers are the misunderstandings that happen in the show, it’s the only thing moving the plot. Forget good writing, forget good drama, forget good comedy, they were basically grabbing shit outta there asses and hoping anything could help move the plot forward. What a joke. <br />
<br />
Rant out of the way, I&#039;d like to say a few things: I don&#039;t have a clue as to why I stuck with this show for 5 tremendously bad episodes and I guess I was really hoping I&#039;d actually get something good outta this show. Instead of romance and comedy, I got stale jokes and bad writing. Basically unoriginal cliche romcom horse arse. To be honest, the thing that drove me to stop watching this show the most was the characters. The characters were so bad it got unbearable; I was at a point in the show that I didn’t care about the plot anymore and was just focusing on how utterly terrible the characters were. It was just so...BAD! Words can’t describe how miserable each episode was, watching as the characters go on their daily lives of looping through the same problems over and over again and never learning. The characters have peas for brains! As for the art, it was mediocre AT BEST but wasn&#039;t too bad. I’d expect better quality though, the colors and designs of the setting and characters were bland and boring to look at. The Sound wasn&#039;t too bad either but not noticably great, though I did kinda enjoy the OP. The OP was catchy and I enjoyed the references to other games (such as PUBG, Super Smash Bros, and Undertale). Besides all of that though, this show could be summed up as a terrible mess or the crap I take after eating the local Chipotle burrito. I don&#039;t recommend this show to anyone who wants REAL romance with an ACTUAL plot, but if you like romcom cliches then go ahead and watch.

    The center of videogame stories are almost often gaming prowess of some schmuck who can go hayaku. But there is another important aspect that is not usually touched on: how videogames affects our day to day interactions and how it opens up a whole new way of forming bonds. There&#039;s a reason why MMO players say &quot;Came for the game, stayed for the community.&quot; It&#039;s a beautiful sentiment that captures the often unheralded but nonetheless important aspect of gaming in today&#039;s society.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m happy to say that Gamers understands that aspect and struggles to make it the core of the series. While the characters right now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254658">
        may feel like it&#039;ll just fill the check-boxes of typical high school stock models, this series can get by with simplistic characterizations because its potential lies in the character interactions more than anything. This is a celebration of gaming as a community after all.<br />
<br />
So far, however, Gamers is an anime you wouldn&#039;t feel bad missing out on. It has shown lopsided execution with a penchant for slapstick humor that can grow old easily, especially if its not your type of humor. The artstyle is less-detailed which enables more fluid animation but it&#039;s largely centered around the aforementioned slapstick comedy and the OST is nothing standout.<br />
<br />
But the anime is not without potential, despite its abysmal first episode which I feel I must warn you about. How it goes about fulfilling that makes or breaks the series.<br />
<br />
Happy TI7 everyone.<br />
<br />
TNC! Tangerine Chicken for the win!

    There is absolutely no way people can be as clueless and absolutely pathetic as these kids are. It&#039;s impossible. The amount of trivial misunderstandings in this anime is criminal. Every single conflict could easily be solved with a normal civilized conversation, with questions being asked between two people for clarification of what they meant. <br />
<br />
I understand the whole &quot;highschooler logic&quot; thing where everyone gets confused and they don&#039;t understand emotions and whatever. But come on. This is going way too far. <br />
<br />
Other than the inept communication ability of all the main characters, the anime is alright. Art is good, music is fine, the plot is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255726">
        fine too. The communication factor is just too big a problem for me to enjoy it. <br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
This story is NOT about games. IS NOT about gaming. And IS NOT about gamers (per se).<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;This story is about misunderstandings&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Just because we have games involved, and gamer characters does not mean this story is about games, that is just collatheral.<br />
<br />
And I have that fact by the proof that so far in the light novel, none of the character are shown participating in competitions or doing a lot of gaming besides certain scenes.<br />
<br />
To understand you need to put yourself in a Japanese person stand point and think how they think. Because this series was made for THEM.<br />
<br />
In a way this story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257066">
        a comedic protest to how japanese people always jumps to conclusions based on impressions or misunderstanding views and how they never talk about it to clear them because &quot;it affects the harmony of the whole&quot;.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen people dissapointed with the series because they cant stand the misunderstandings because they had the impression this story is about games, which is not.<br />
<br />
Now up to the review:<br />
Gamers!<br />
Is a story about a bunch of gaming kids that love to play games.<br />
Some use the games to gain prestige and win competitions.<br />
Others just play to have fun with them and be casual.<br />
Then we have the pressure of the normalfags who make fun of them.<br />
<br />
Between the characters and their low confident or low self esteem, we have the typical case of japanese person who asume things based on image and impressions and how they dont feel worthy to others.<br />
Pushing their views to others and how they always jump into the wrong conclusion based on image and how they always keep everything inside without talking about it.<br />
<br />
This is the beauty of gamers!<br />
An exageration of the infamous japanese misunderstanding thoughts based on impressions!<br />
A bunch of teenage kids who likes to play games which end up assuming things based on their low self esteem and impresions coming to the wrong conclusions and never talk it out to clear them.<br />
And since its an exaheration it gives charm to the comedy of it.<br />
Which also add some dramas and facepalm moments which makes this series enjoyable!<br />
Its like a rollercoaster thrill of ups and downs and mishaves that makes you sometimes cheer for these characters and other times just punch them.<br />
<br />
First of all we have Amano Keita:<br />
A casual gamer otaku with low self esteem that really wants to make friends to have fun with games in a joy and casual form. But dont insult his friends or else he will bite at you.<br />
Sadly his low self esteem makes see himself unworthy makes him always jump to conclusions and exagerates the pesimistic view in his mind.<br />
<br />
Second we have Tendou Karen:<br />
A princess type girl who is the madonna of school. She is into competition gaming to gain prestige and fame. She rebuilt the gaming club for such actions as the previous club members won many trophies so she dont want to ket them down. Also the principal let her have the club with the condition to gain prestige. She also dislike casual games and sees them as trash since you cannot win competitions with them. (Reason why i began to dislike her, i took offense to that). Fell in love with Amano after she hears him defend her and her club in a valiant way. Since then she sees amano as a prince and tries to recruit him for her club to be with him but ended as his girlfriend by a misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
Third is Uehara Tasuku:<br />
An ex game otaku now turn into ikemen. Became friends with Amano by a misunderstanding as he saw the kid had gust in the end when provoked. He has the chuuni habit of talking to himself in a superior sense as if all of them would be lost without him. He also decided to be Amano&#039;s wingman for the girls that were interested in Amano making himself wall in a riot of misunderstandings because of it, but he is not far into jumping to conclusions.<br />
<br />
Fourth is Aguri:<br />
A nerdy girl turned-bubbly-bishoujo who had a crush on Uehara since middle school. After she saw him change she changed herself to fit his liking and ended dating. But also fell into a riot of misunderstandings as she also jumped to conclusions after she saw Tasuku interact with other girls (when he was working as Amano&#039;s wingman). She ended up becoming good friends with Amano because of, as Amano tries to help her save her relationship.<br />
<br />
Fifth comes Chiaki:<br />
Another gamer girl who is the female synonim of Amano Keita. Chiaki met Amano when he came to her class after Uehara tried to hook them up. Everything started well, both of them likes same things, same games and get along... Until they discovered they have different opinions about certain games then the bickering began. Since then Chiaki and Amano act like a bickering married couple which made Uehara wonder why dont they just hook up. In the end it turns out that Chiaki is in fact Amano&#039;s admired doujin game maker and his best game partner Nobe and Mono.<br />
<br />
Sixth is Konoha:<br />
Chiaki&#039;s little sister who was dragged into the mess thanks to Chiaki herself. She and Amano hits it off and become good friends since they both love visual novels, but deep inside Konoha is a pervert who wants to bang bishoujo (cute girls) making her a bit of a lesbian or at least bisexual. Her preference is erogaming which she tries to keep it a secret to hide her lewd persona. She also becomes Chiaki&#039;s wingman (or wingwoman) as she tries to hook both Chiaki and Amano up.<br />
<br />
And that is the whole deal.<br />
&quot;Gamers!&quot; Is about teenagers getting involved in misunderstandings to add drama to their youth. Which makes the beauty of the series.

    misunderstandings and really awkward, awfully written characters! nice bait and switch with the gaming theme btw. i really appreciate how this turned into yet another terrible, cliche-ridden, flavorless romcom after like 3 episodes and completely threw away the idea of actually being about games at all. it&#039;s so ridiculously convoluted and over the top with the constant misunderstandings (that would instantly be solved by any single character actually acting like a human being) that it&#039;s actually somewhat memorable/noteworthy. noteworthy for being shitty, but still.<br />
<br />
but seriously, why is this show called &quot;Gamers!&quot;? the show has almost nothing to do with games at this point, and as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256524">
        a &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;gamer&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;, i can&#039;t say that any of the characters are particularly relatable. probably because they all have a deadly combination of fetal alcohol syndrome + terminal aspergers and i don&#039;t. that and i also didn&#039;t have 3 obvious girlfriend candidates and a wide social circle in high school. i also actually played videogames, rather than spending every day poorly handling relationship issues, huffing paint, and making unfunny, forced game references. wow, a character got upset and randomly blurted out the konami code! hilarious! this is the pinnacle of comedy! what&#039;s next, a character becoming so happy that they can&#039;t help but shout &quot;THE CAKE IS A LIE!&quot;?<br />
<br />
any time they do actually talk about games, it makes me cringe so hard i feel like i&#039;m going to implode. they&#039;re playing the mario kart arcade game and MC gets an item that apparently has a 50% chance of blowing up everyone around him and a 50% chance of blowing himself up. after this is explained to him, the blonde girl says &quot;it&#039;s really hard to use on this map!&quot; .....what? why would the map have even the tiniest bearing on how difficult it is to use? ?????????????????? nice show. totally wasn&#039;t written by a 40 year old that only plays a mobage once a week.<br />
<br />
i feel like people get so caught up in praising this show for the MC not immediately accepting the club invite (so unique!!!!) that they&#039;re able pretend like the show didn&#039;t immediately turn into a cliche factory afterward. i turned my brain off as soon as i saw bridge scene in episode 2 or 3 where MC is vehemently defending a girl he has talked to for all of 5 minutes with a &quot;YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT ABOUT ME, BUT DON&#039;T TALK BAD ABOUT HER!&quot; and nearly kills the guy with his retard strength. of course, the girl is secretly watching this exchange and falls madly in love with MC as a result. really breaking new ground here.<br />
<br />
in conclusion, this show is basically just Netoge no Yome season 2 but with less games and more glue consumption. only watch it if you love misunderstandings and hate anything resembling actual human interaction.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit I was hooked in for the first few episodes of the series, they were very appealing and interesting for me as an avid gaming fan. But it all fell apart midway.<br />
<br />
I went into the show completely blind not knowing what to expect, and the first episode was great. It had very nice gaming culture references from CSGO and even Guilty Gear! It made the MC, Keita, a very relatable character that just wants to plays game for fun instead of playing it competitively like the gaming club does.<br />
<br />
The second episode was wonderful as well, especially with its wonderfully animated introduction

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257037">
        sequence and the nest full of gaming culture references in it. This episode focused more on Uehara&#039;s character and his transition from being a loner gamer nerd to a typical cool and handsome stud. There is one part where Uehara and Keita are in the arcade and playing Persona 4 Arena, a fighting game, where Uehara basically is able to read Keita&#039;s movements and basically body him due to his &#039;noob&#039; tells/tendencies in the game. That part was the hook, line and sinker for me in this anime and I was even more excited in watching the third episode for the series.<br />
<br />
At this point I had thought that the plot would be focusing on Uehara and Keita&#039;s journey in the gaming club, but this was not the case.<br />
<br />
Episodes 3 and 4 rolled along, and now I had this bad premonition that this anime was actually not what I thought it was.<br />
<br />
Episodes 5 and 6 came out and I just felt crushed. It was at this point where I realised that they would be focusing on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters and that just completely turned off this anime for me. The selling point of the anime for me, about how it was gaming, was now almost completely gone and I had just lost interest in continuing to watch the series.<br />
<br />
It could have been such an interesting concept for an anime, focusing on the inner workings of competitive gaming and gamers. It had untapped potential and they just threw it all away in favour of an overly clichéd misunderstanding-riddled romcom.<br />
<br />
And god, the characters. The character development between the main characters was just completely thrown into the garbage, it felt like the characters&#039; personalities from the first few episode had completely flipped and they were now all completely naive and oblivious.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, there are people who would like this type of anime, but this just isn&#039;t my cup of tea, I just didn&#039;t like how they just suddenly steered away from gaming almost completely and instead focused solely on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters.<br />
<br />
At least, the artstyle of the anime is decent, nothing flashy but still okay, and I do love the music as well as the wonderful opening of the series.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s very disappointing to see how this anime turned out, it could have been one of my favourite animes of this year. It feels that the title of the series &#039;Gamers!&#039; was just stuck there just to draw in gamers into watching this anime, and it definitely did, I just wished they at least would have tried to made the focal point of the series to be gaming instead.

    I don&#039;t quite understand the people reviewing this. Are you seriously telling me this is relatable to how &quot;gamers&quot; behave?<br />
That must be a joke, because in the first place, The &quot;Gamers!&quot; in the title is only to lure for viewers, nothing more. The plot itself has nothing relatable to video games, this series is all about misunderstandings and a boring/generic romcom plot.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the basics, the story is pretty bland, first 3 episodes do have a bit of game references and how the protagonists game and stuff. That&#039;s about it, after episode 4 the misunderstandings and the romcom start, but horribly. I understand the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257515">
        misunderstandings are the plot itself, but they are making it so they are slow paced and rather boring, at times it feels like filler when it obviously shouldn&#039;t be. It just feels like they are dragging it to at least make it up to 12 episodes because we haven&#039;t gotten any progress in the story so far, always at the same point, but it is a &quot;slice of life&quot;. Althought, i wouldn&#039;t consider a slice of life.<br />
<br />
My general problem with these misunderstandings is that they are all the same, i expected them to improvise a bit and make them different than each other, but they only spoil on how a one cheats on another when it doesn&#039;t really happen, blah, blah... Tell me, where&#039;s the creativity in that? In the end, the plot doesn&#039;t move on because of this.<br />
<br />
Artwise, the animation is nothing special, but i don&#039;t really mind it. The designs are really good for the most part. Environments are quite good looking and scenarios are fitting. The colour palette is quite nice and vibrant too.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music is top notch if you ask me, but i feel like the BGM does not fit with the scenes at times. VA are quite enjoyable, and really nice choice. The Op might be the only thing from this anime that includes Game references, the ED is enjoyable as well.<br />
<br />
This is the other problem i have with most reviews and the series itself. There&#039;s nothing from the character development and behaviour that make me think &quot;oh i act like that&quot; &quot;that has happened to me&quot; &quot;oh i hate that feeling&quot;, literally nothing. Well, i didn&#039;t think anything of that because, the character development is horse poop, like the only character we know a bit is Tendou, no one else had a &quot;let me get to know thing&quot; thingy were we see their daily lives and stuff. We are already at episode 10, and i would&#039;ve loved to see a bit of storyline for the game club Tendou has, i would&#039;ve loved to see more from the protagonists as child&#039; and how they got into games (But, obviously that won&#039;t be possible, this isn&#039;t a series about gamers)<br />
<br />
The whole premise was good, but not with an almost clickbait title &quot;Gamers!&quot;, the series is just a generic romcom we see all seasons. Nothing new, nothing creative and nothing funny about it. I did wait quite some time to see if things would&#039;ve gotten to the start point again, but nope, it&#039;s just the same over and over again. Edit: I&#039;m dropping it, i&#039;m just tired of this whole plot, it makes no sense. Lowered from 3 to 2 on overall.<br />

    Alright, I almost dropped this anime from episode 1 because I got influenced by some reviews saying its &#039;cliché&#039;. Note to self: Never read mal reviews before judging a show by myself ever again.<br />
Just know that clichés do not automatically make a show bad. A very great example of a clichés done right is Konosuba, which utilises the isekai trope to create a wonderful and humorous parody of the actual genre, and in my opinion, another great example is Gamers!. This turned out to be one of the most impressionable romcoms for me.<br />
<br />
The reason I almost dropped this show was because I was overly judgemental

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259685">
        on its first episode. Admittedly, the following  clichés were a bit of a turn off at the beginning: &quot;high school game club&quot; and  &quot;otaku-pandering main protaganist&quot;. Basically the premise of episode 1 at first felt kind of uninteresting and even unrealistic. <br />
I decided to give this anime another chance after months because I saw that it had potential. After re-evaluating the character motives and  making the effort to actually think deeper into the actions of the characters, it made so much more sense. It&#039;s evident from episode 1 that the character motives in the entirety of the show can be sometimes hard to grasp and character&#039;s actions can often feel unreasonable or confusing (as expected of every drama show tho).  However they really are quite meaningful when given a second thought. The premise starts getting way more entertaining after episode 2 with the slight twist. What’s hilarious is that the much hated ‘game club’ cliché was actually almost never mentioned again in the show, despite spending 1 episode introducing it. It just shows how self-aware the humour is, by first baiting the audience into thinking “It’s another one of those shows… .-.” then surprising them and making fun of it. (tl;dr: so if you&#039;re planning to get into this show, be prepared for a little bit of confusion. if u want to understand every character fully, give everything some thought and it&#039;s actually quite meaningful)<br />
<br />
The main appeal of this show is that it handles the relationship drama part of it really well. Its humour stems from how self-aware the show is to the many supposed clichés, making fun of it and deriving humour from that. (I kind of see elements of Konosuba’s humour in this show.) It also does the whole ‘misunderstandings’ thing better than most other shows by making light-hearted fun of it. I find it so funny because it makes fun of exactly what I LOATHE about many drama shows and actually making it work well.<br />
See, misunderstandings in anime, especially in romance dramas, were something that I always hated to the core. It always annoyed me to no end when shows used &#039;misunderstandings&#039; as a main driving point of its plot as an excuses to either lengthen itself or to drive its melodrama. Shows like the second season of Kimi ni Todoke has fueled my hate for this because it JUST isn&#039;t realistic, the character&#039;s constant beating around the bush and not noticing the most obvious things just annoys me at how un-humanlike the characters become because of it. The problem is that most of the time, their misunderstandings can all be fixed if the characters just calm the fuck down, sit down and talk it out... Shows like that just feel very unnecessarily dragged out, insincere and boring. Drilling the frankly petty misunderstandings into our heads and making it the main point of the show be the drama that comes from them honestly makes it emotionally exhausting to watch.<br />
Of course, I have seen a small few anime that actually effectively used misunderstandings, but that’s hard to pull off, because you have to make the effort to make the misunderstandings feel genuinely realistic or relatable for the show to be actually be likable. (One example is Tsuki ga Kirei, I could get into why in another review)<br />
<br />
However, when misunderstandings are used as a meta plot device to not only get great humour out of it, but also as a way to bond and develop characters, that’s good shit. Gamers! does it so well. Notice how really it doesn’t get sad and edgy all because of some stupid misunderstanding but it not only gets funnier, characters also know each other better and develop through those experiences.<br />
<br />
Here are some other small examples of self-aware humour that I laughed way too hard at, which made fun of things other anime did badly:<br />
1. Having Uehara as the intelligent, NOT dense character that actually knows what’s going on. The fact that he judges situations and can read people’s expressions (like a normal person would) is just hilarious. Viewers can really relate to him as he actually reads into things instead of being any other dense character that does not give anything a second thought.<br />
2. The fact that Uehara and Keita consciously calls everyone into meetups to clear misunderstandings LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN WOULD DO. It’s so rewarding to see anime characters use common sense instead of beating around the bush.<br />
3. Small things like the cliché-looking student council members of the other school or other blatant references to different clichés like Misumi Eiichi&#039;s little section on the last episode. XD<br />
4.  How the game club which was &#039;supposed&#039; to be the main focus of the show completely became irrelevant later in the show.<br />
5. The extremely amusing and exaggerated misunderstandings that thankfully were not unnecessarily over-complicated and edgy.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d give this show a strong 8.5/10<br />
This show is great and it has some silly and lovable characters that unexpectedly develops through light-hearted drama and misunderstandings. The ending was an emotional pay-off and was greatly satisfying. Instead of being sad and edgy and unrealistic, it resolves all the romance and drama like a man, and in heartwarming and gratifying ways! You know a show is great when you actually like and care about every one of its characters. I have not even mentioned the &quot;Gamer&quot; part of this show, which I absolutely loved and related to. References everywhere, and it even teaches some really meaningful values for gamers at episode 4. Gaming is a huge theme (no shit) in Gamers! and fits into the contexts of the plot and characters so well: characters are bonded by and understands each other through the common interest of games. Maaaybe a little otaku-pandering but still relatable to most people. Yes there are some flaws that I won&#039;t mention here, but overall it&#039;s an extremely sweet and enjoyable show that can NEVER DESERVE THE “4” RATING. HMPH &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
I’ll edit in more to this review when I can remember more necessary things to add. Right now I’m too tired to remember everything I wanted to say. This was basically a drunken rant at 3 am after getting slightly triggered by the bad ratings in mal and wanting to do this anime some good. Knowing the fact that I almost dropped this show and that more people like me will because of mal reviews, I wanted to do this anime some justice. This definitely deserves more praise imo!

    F*ck me this was a pain to watch. I understand how a romcom can be enjoyable when the characters are a bit stupid, but f*cking hell this overstepped the boundaries by far. <br />
<br />
I have to say that some aspects of characters are quite relatable, hence why I think this anime portrays them terribly. When you have the most popular girl in school, who acts like a cold b*tch to everyone, blushing in front of you, surely you get that something is up. Yes, girls might feel like they are difficult to understand and that is true in real life tbf, but surely you recognize when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396758">
        she starts acting different around you. <br />
<br />
Another really annoying point is that talking to someone is already seen as cheating/love. I get that this is supposed to add to the comedy but does that really happen? No, of course not. It only adds to the characters being absolutely braindead and not being able to speak their mind. If some find that o be comedy, that is fine but man it just pains me.<br />
<br />
Misunderstandings are also a crucial part of this anime, because if at least 10 happen every episode, then it should be funny right? NO! <br />
<br />
This anime just really scarred me mentally for how bad it was.

    *Review may contain minor spoilers*<br />
<br />
Man this anime makes me so angry..<br />
<br />
Story 1/10<br />
there is the &#039;&#039;loser&quot; who gets asked to join the game club by the most popular girl in school, once upon going to check out the game club, there are a few very talented people and they won alot of prizes etc, So you might think this anime will be very nice about competitive gaming. NO IT IS NOT!! From ep3 till the end gaming made barely an appearance, It was just a pentagon of love and misunderstanding about who loves/cheat on each other.. And it didn&#039;t even have a real ending man..<br />
<br />
Art 4/10

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259447">
        <br />
The art is nothing special only minor point i have to say here is that sometimes the chars look like robots, like when they zoom out on walking scenes etc there arms move like robots, wtf is this sh*t? can&#039;t you make them walk like normal?<br />
<br />
Sound 4/10<br />
the characters sound like they are screaming all the time with there annoying voices, 3 different ending songs also? why?<br />
<br />
Character 1/10<br />
Like i said in the story, they were really good at competitive gaming, but then it turns out all this anime was just about pentagon of love and misunderstandings , no background on gaming, the mc is a total loser who can&#039;t do anything, he even sucks a** at games..<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10<br />
Man what is this F**king piece of sh*t anime, it made me so angry, you have such a cool &#039;story&#039; to work with and you just gonna change everything for a boring love/slice of life/school anime full of misunderstandings and endless screaming? cmn..<br />
<br />
Overall 2.2/10<br />
This anime is a &#039;&#039;scam&#039;&#039; and just uses the gamer tag to draw in more people, it has nothing to do with gaming except for the occasional gaming talk they have followed up by misunderstandings about them love triangle.<br />
Please do yourself a favor and never watch this.<br />
also please do not make a season 2.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Hey guys, do you like video games? Are you a gamer? Are you alone? Are you an awkward individual? Are you also an otaku? If you checked off more than one of the options I listed, I got the show just for you! It&#039;s &quot;Gamers!&quot; The show where all of your characters are nothing more than a bunch of awkward teenagers trying to connect with each other.<br />
<br />
You can&#039;t help but cover your eyes hoping it doesn&#039;t get any cringier. Seeing this makes me want to bawl my eyes out as the characters fail to interact with each other like regular human beings. It&#039;s a mixture

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258983">
        of cringe, frustration, and stupid fun rolled into one. First and foremost, I&#039;d like to say, the show is a comedy. Personally, if a show has made me laugh countless times, I&#039;d say it did its job correctly. I&#039;m sure it is also safe to say that the show is one giant ball of confusion. At a certain point, you would hope that the confusions would be solved A.S.A.P. right and everything would be fine and dandy? WRONG! The confusion just keeps going on and on and quite frankly, it feels mundane. <br />
<br />
I would also like to mention the casual and competitive gaming portion of the anime. Personally, I was hoping there would be more emphasis on the difference between those two as the anime is titled &quot;Gamers!&quot; but it seems to be more focused on the relationships between the confusion of the character&#039;s romances.<br />
<br />
The anime opening and ending theme songs aren&#039;t special in any type of way either except that it sounds video game-y and the art is art.<br />
<br />
To sum this whole show up, there&#039;s a love/hate feeling with this anime. I had a good time laughing but also a good considerable amount of time cringing at everything that happened out of pure stupidity from the characters. To a certain extent, what they do is reasonable like being jealous and worrying about their partner cheating but the misunderstandings are just irritating. I had expectations that it was going to be a typical, otaku, video game club anime where the main character is a wuss which is kind of true but there were times when the characters stood up for themselves and I, personally, found that admirable in its own way. There could&#039;ve been multiple ways where &quot;Gamers!&quot; could&#039;ve been better but what I got were headaches and laughable cringe. Keep your dreams to yourself. The show is a slap to your face for having expectations.

    Gamers is...frusterating. <br />
<br />
It is a cluster of things that I enjoy and don&#039;t enjoy, I myself being a fairly hardcore gamer, mostly in game types not really covered in the short time gaming is mentioned. <br />
<br />
The story itself begins with a very socially awkward Keita, the beautiful president Tendou, boyfriend and girlfriend Uehara and aguri, and fellow gaming addict Hoshinomori.<br />
<br />
The series starts out well. The first 3 to 4 episodes are honestly pretty good, with surprises in how the main character acts, and how all the other characters react to him. <br />
<br />
But then, from then on, it turns into a cluster of high school emotions.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257081">
        So much random drama, so many random &quot;He&#039;s cheating!!&quot; So much angst and randomness. And it loses any surprise, so that by the time the two you want to date (Presumably Tendou and Keita) start dating there&#039;s no more hype, and that leads to the next issue: The joke has already worn itself down. The joke being that Keita is socially awkward, probably moreso then anyone other then Hoshinomori (Who, for whatever reason, on episode 9, they start pushing for relationship between Keita and her??) <br />
<br />
Wouldn&#039;t recommend this. There&#039;s so many series that do it better, but it&#039;s not unwatchable.
