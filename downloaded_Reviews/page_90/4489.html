    Le Portrait de Petit Cossette is, first of all, a work that tries to be visual art, about visual art. It tries to tell what is in essence a very simple story in the first place by means of short scenes using specific visual style, and only in the second place by actual conversation and plot development that is spelled out. Thus, if, after watching the first episode you decide you really don&#039;t like the visual style used, don&#039;t bother watching the other two episodes: this series is not for you.<br />
<br />
With regard to the plot, it would be no exaggeration to state that the same

        story could have been told within five minutes, nor would it be too much to say that any review of the plot would also most likely divulge what little twist there is. In essence, the story revolves around two artists and a piece of art, the portrait of a young girl, and the two differing outlooks on art these two artists have: one in the end prefers the piece of art, unchanging and everlastingly beautiful, unwilling even to acknowledge the existence of the living, changing &#039;original&#039; girl, while the other prefers his art to be alive in some fashion, even if this means that change and loss exist. It is a story about the love of the artist for his art, a love that is profound enough to accept the necessity of loss, even, if necessary, of the self.<br />
Nowhere is the story explained in as much words as I&#039;ve used above, or are there pieces of dialogue directly concerning this difference in outlooks on art. In fact, there is not that much dialogue at all, nor does the show try to explore the main characters: there is little in the way of actual plot or character development.<br />
This is because Le Portrait de Petit Cossette is a Romantic piece, or, more accurately, a piece of Romantic horror. The plot is a gathering of tropes from the genre, and focuses to a large extent on the passionate love of the main characters without giving much in the way of an explanation for their feelings and behaviour, wholly following the example of the greater pieces of Sturm und Drang literature, where round characters were considered less important than the strength of what little they tried to convey. Even the fact that the plot seems confusing, and that not everything is explained or neatly given a purpose within the story can be fully explained as Romantic horror: from Poe to Lovecraft the actual lack of a full explanation served to enhance the story.<br />
When all is said and done, the story might not be all that original, or contain a lot of development. It is, however, very true to form.<br />
<br />
The art is simply gorgeous. A lot of different styles are used, from simple nature backgrounds to what has been described as &amp;quot;bargain-basement Salvador Dali&amp;quot;, with an emphasis on portraying scenes in twilight or with light that is filtered, seemingly in order to make the few bright points stand out more. Even though not all styles work out equally fine - especially the more surrealistic scenes tend to be a bit over the top - they do usually perfectly portray the mood of a certain scene.<br />
To this is added a soundtrack consisting largely of semi-classical music that does a wonderful job in strengthening the different moods, ranging from simple, uplifting tunes to a ballad that is beautiful and haunting, even though it is sung in Japanese, which does not really fit the mood.<br />
It is true that this show is pretentious, as is, it should be said, all art, and visual arts have a tendency to be even more pretentious than music or literature: the use of a French title (containing errors in grammar, spelling, and syntax, to boot, as it should have been titled &amp;quot;Le portrait de la Petite Cosette&amp;quot;) is in itself proof of this, as is the bundling of a whole bunch of different musical and visual styles. On the other hand, it is quite honest about its being pretentious, and it must be said that, in the end, what matters in visual art is the art, not story, and not character. Anime is visual art, and no matter how good a series is, it will never be better than a solid book in portraying story or characters. What it adds are visuals, and these enhance the story in a way words alone can never do. To me, it is not too pretentious to try and make the story revolve around the art, and not the other way round: in a way, that seems to be what anime should in the end be about.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t lie. I consider Le Portrait de Petit Cossette to be the best piece of film I have ever seen, without a single doubt. As implied above, it is very difficult to make an objective statement on story and art, as you either like the style, or you don&#039;t. To me the different scenes do connect, and portray a story about longing, love, and sacrifice that portray thoughts that can be felt, but not put into words - though they can be shown. <br />
In a way, I am in love with these three episodes like the protagonist is in love with the painting, and, thus, am unable to see anything that could detract from this impression. Perhaps that simple fact is the greatest compliment a show can receive.

    There are a lot of ways to frighten people and make them feel vulnerable in a primal way, and therefore there are a lot of ways to execute horror—outright screaming and slashing, psychological mind games, the appearance of the supernatural. And somewhere, buried under all of those, is a subset of horror which I internally refer to as “weird and atmospheric.” Not very professional, I know, but it&#039;s the sort of bin into which I throw things like Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, a three episode OVA that is just plain strange more so than anything else. Of course, you could also call it a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93865">
        romance, or a drama, or a mystery; Cossette is a very creative and ambitious work that plays leapfrog across genre boundaries, but unfortunately, so do its numerous flaws.<br />
<br />
Cossette&#039;s story is relatively simple, but for whatever reason, its creators seem eager to make it as difficult to follow as possible. There are frequent changes in setting between the real world and a surrealistic hallucinatory world that the protagonist visits. These transitions take place with little tact, and they give the series a very warped sense of chronology which is only added to by the use of repetitive flashbacks to events that happened only minutes ago. There is little to no explanation offered as to what this surreal world actually represents, and the OVA seems to take it for granted that the audience will be able to interpret the significance (if there is any) of the events that transpire there without much help, a proposition that&#039;s dubious at best and downright foolish at worst. What&#039;s happening in the real world isn&#039;t very interesting, either; the protagonist&#039;s group of age-appropriate female friends are noticing that he&#039;s having a bit of a mental breakdown, they&#039;re all concerned with his well-being, and they take various actions to try to ensure his safety. This story thread ultimately serves very little purpose, and is more or less just a distraction from the central plot. To even understand that plot requires using tremendous amounts of speculation and assumption to fill in the gaping holes left by the writers. I&#039;m confident that I&#039;m a reasonably attentive viewer, and I don&#039;t feel at all embarrassed to say that on the first watch of Cossette, I could only guess at what was happening for at least forty percent of the OVA&#039;s running length. There&#039;s a fine line between minimalistic storytelling and poor storytelling. It gets crossed here, in spades.<br />
<br />
I wish I could say that the characters swooped in and redeemed everything, but it wasn&#039;t to be. Our male lead, Eiri, an amateur artist who owns an antique shop, is a neat concept, but he has all the personality of a dishrag, and is little more than a tool used to push an overly obvious thematic agenda on the audience. The same can be said of Cossette, the doomed young daughter of foreign nobility whose soul is trapped in a decorative glass; what a great idea, and what a shockingly lackluster execution. Her lack of character might be explained away by the idea that she is supposed to represent an object of obsession rather than a person, but the fact that she responds in kind to Eiri&#039;s love sort of voids that entire train of thought. There&#039;s an attempt at romance, but I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll probably say it again—romance holds no meaning when neither character is even identifiable as an individual. Supporting roles, you ask? Welcome to the cast of cliches: A close female friend who is in love with Eiri but has difficulty showing it, two local psychics who give Eiri vague spiritual advice (such gems as “there&#039;s a soul in everything”), a hard-nosed doctor who notices Eiri&#039;s failing mental and physical state, a girl smitten with Eiri who works at a local restaurant. They&#039;re introduced haphazardly and, again, we&#039;re often left to make assumptions about who they even are and what their relationship is to Eiri. Most of them are cardboard cutouts graced with the privilege of about two or three lines of dialogue, and their role in the story as a whole is rather unnecessary. There&#039;s some kind of halfhearted harem drama between the overly zealous friend who is in love with Eiri and the rest of the cast. This element isn&#039;t very well thought out, nor does it have any place in the OVA, and it falls more or less flat.<br />
<br />
Artistically, Cossette has a lot of merit. The production values are reasonably high. The character designs are inoffensive. The backgrounds are lovely, ranging from verdant forests to foggy city streets, and the atmosphere created in the bowels of Eiri&#039;s dusty antique store is suitably eerie. Somewhere along the line, though, Cossette trades all of that for a ridiculous amount of CGI, editing, and visual trickery that&#039;s really quite annoying. It turns into a regular slideshow of artistic tricks-of-the-trade. Name a strange camera angle, lighting or filtering choice, or visual distortion, and the odds are pretty good that it&#039;s here. Cossette just can&#039;t resist: A shot through stained glass here, a weird point-of-view through a digital camera there, an overlay of flickering static, an endless pan over a computer-generated landscape. Words cannot even describe the number of techniques in play here, most of which serve no purpose other than as a sort of directorial “hey, look what I can do!” In terms of the technical implementation, they might very well be flawless, but I&#039;ll be damned if I can see a reason for their awkward inclusion. The OVA is actually at its best when none of these are employed. The halls and darkened storage rooms of Eiri&#039;s store, with antiques stacked around him like tombstones, are a lot more unsettling than the tactless barrage of seizure-inducing effects.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re the type to look at the staff listing, you might be able to guess that there&#039;s one aspect of Cossette that is tough to complain about, and that&#039;s the music. Yuki Kajiura does what she does best: Sweeping modern orchestral compositions backed by chanted vocals, intricate piano melodies, soft and haunting atmospheric noise. The soundtrack sounds great both in the context of the OVA and on its own. It doesn&#039;t sound as clear or as polished as her later work, but it&#039;s arguably as good as any other musical score she&#039;s been involved with, and that should say just about everything; it&#039;s grade-A, plain and simple. It&#039;s not terribly difficult to label the soundtrack as Cossette&#039;s strongest element. Imagine judging a dog show where the only contestants are a beautiful golden retriever and a dead possum. That&#039;s the choice I had to make.<br />
<br />
Harsh words all around, and yet, that number does say five, which is far from the worst available score. Cossette might have inexcusably poor writing, but it does have some technical merits to fall back on, and I&#039;ll begrudgingly admit that it&#039;s a captivating watch even though the visuals are obnoxious. It&#039;s also a very creative idea, and while that idea ultimately isn&#039;t capitalized on, I can tell that it is trying to make an ambitious statement about art and the nature of human interaction with art. This thematic material isn&#039;t handled well at all, but the fact that there&#039;s even any thematic material worth mentioning in the first place is something. In a word, Cossette is a mess, and I really can&#039;t give it the most enthusiastic praise, but creativity and ambition are present, and if nothing else, it&#039;s certainly a unique piece of work.

    The elegant flow of luxurious hair contours gracefully along the pristine crown down the petite collar of the unsurpassed delicate flower.  Golden locks glisten under the flicker of a saffron flame.  The soft, supple facial features radiate pure ineffable beauty, displaying no discernment of imperfection. She is the stimulus that evokes profound imagination, via the means of simply existing.  Her fortuitous, biological circumstances have destined her to inject inspiration into the psyche of the perceptive virtuoso, to invigorate him to produce marvelous portraits of exquisite splendor.  She is the beacon that guides his creative spirit towards its fullest potential, realizing the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297935">
        end goal of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.<br />
<br />
She is Essential.  She is Beautiful.  She is Perfection.  She is a Muse.<br />
<br />
If the perceived perfection is identified as genuine, is it not irresponsible to allow ne plus ultra beauty to be squandered to the inexorable flow of time?  Marchello Orlando, a man obsessed with the unparalleled beauty of his “lover,” believed it immoral to permit such beauty to wither away — even if it required the assassination of the angelic person, whom he professed his adoration.  For Marchello, terminating inimitable elegance was paramount in the pursuit of “preserving” his masterwork(s).  But art is not an exercise in preservation, rather it’s a rendition of singular moments/conceptions that are ever-fleeting.  The art, itself, is preserved, but the transient process is lost to the annals of time.   Eiri Kurahashi, a young artist who becomes entranced by Cossette d’Auvergne’s haunting beauty, discovers the ennui of drawing a pseudo preservation of Marchello’s “divine” deed.  In a physical and emotional catharsis, Eiri uses his own blood to paint a stunning portrait of his tormenting muse.  Signifying Eiri&#039;s denial of Marchello’s notion of preservation, in lieu of acknowledging the muse for what she really is (a human being), and not for what she represents (perfection personified).<br />
<br />
The porcelain doll shedding tears of blood, was the surrealistic representation of how Marchello viewed Cossette.  It is said that “the eyes are the windows of the soul,” and given that the doll (Cossette) has no eyes, she, invariably, has no soul.  By virtue of his blood pact with Cossette, Eiri offers his own soul as a form of reparation for “his” past ill deeds.  He is, after all, the reincarnation of Marchello.  The man who rejected Cossette’s life, for his own idealistic vision.  Of course, Eiri suffers extensively for his “past” transgressions, in a myriad of chilling scenes with hauntingly beautiful artwork.  Screeching violins go hand and hand with the gothic aesthetic, creating a melancholic atmosphere to accentuate Eiri’s gruesome retribution.<br />
<br />
Cossette, inadvertently, gives inspiration to her “two lovers,” but while Marchello takes her gift and forsakes her for it; Eiri, on the other hand, returns the favor by giving his blood (the necessary fluid of human life) to affirm her existence as valuable, and not merely the object for which one derives self-actualization.  Eiri, after 250 years, releases Cossette from her bondage of eternal “preservation,” by rejecting the flawless imposter (the muse, if you will) for the release of the real Cossette from her unsought constraints; thus, allowing her soul to transcend the intermediary world and finally be at peace.  <br />
<br />
The emancipation of Cossette absolved Eiri from his own misguided idealism.  Empowering him to break free from his self-created muse infatuation, and, hopefully, learn to foster an emotionally symbiotic relationship.  Eiri (Marchello) deluded himself in the pursuit of capturing impeccable beauty; thus, dissociating himself from the pivotal social interactions of his everyday life.

    Le Portrait de Petite Cossette. Where to start.... Well, the storyline is pretty good, but there are several flaws that come with it. The main flaw, is that there are several times where you have to &amp;quot;fill-in-the-blanks&amp;quot; yourself, or in other words, perhaps go back and watch it several times to undertsnad it. Anohter flaw is a lot similar to this is where you might wonder how the main character ends up in a particular place, just out of the blue. The story is actually for the most part quite well made but just with several flaws. The art is, in my opinion, very breath-taking.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5624">
        It is much more detailed than other Anime I&#039;ve watched other than &amp;quot; The Count of Monte Cristo&amp;quot;. The sound is probably the best part in my opinion, and I highly reccomend downloading or buying the Soundtrack. (I would give out a particular link but since MyAnimeList has asked me not to, I will do much to oblige them).=) But anyway, the music during each episode goes along so well with the story, keeping you interested the entire way through. The characters are great for the mst part. I did however think that they coud have made Eiri, the main character, sound a lot better with some better dialogue. Cossette is by far the best character in the story, including movements, actions, and dialogue. I enjoyed a lot and reccomend it to anyone. EXCEPT-kids. This is probably the most gothic Anime I have watched, and it is very, very gory and bloody. There is some slight nudity, but nothing too too, inappropriate. Overall it was very good, in fact, it was much better than I thought it would be. If you are into the whole romance anime mixed with some action fighting-for-the-one-you-love-with-gothic style, then by God, this Anime is definitely for you!

    Welcome, My Friends, to horror anime month. For the next five weeks we&#039;ll be looking at things that go bump in the night. Experience suggests that most of them will not actually be scary in the slightest in spite of the genre label. In fact, I think the only truly frightening anime I&#039;ve ever reviewed in October was Perfect Blue and everything else just used horror to mean “there are monsters.” In any case, let&#039;s start the month off with Le Portrait de Petit Cosette which is a bit unique for an anime in that it&#039;s not based on anything. The three episode OVA was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115085">
        produced by Daume, the studio responsible for Onegai Teacher and Shiki. There is a manga, but it&#039;s based on the OVA instead of the other way around. Let&#039;s turn out all the lights and take a look. <br />
<br />
Our story begins with our protagonist, Eiri, hanging out with some friends. But don&#039;t get attached to them because they&#039;ll only appear in one other, brief scene. They talk briefly about love and Eiri runs off for his part time job at his uncle&#039;s antique shop. He spends some time just holding and looking at a glass. A glass that seems to contain a girl that only he can see. The biggest problem with this OVA is that it meanders. What I mean by that is that there are a lot of scenes that go nowhere and don&#039;t tie into the main plot. Not only that, but the animation will frequently shift to random things (a street, a mailbox, tableware, bamboo, butterflies, etc...) during conversations. I still can&#039;t figure out whether this is supposed to be disconcerting or it&#039;s just a way to pad the OVA. If it&#039;s the former it doesn&#039;t work. The latter would seem more probable since this OVA drags. You wouldn&#039;t think I&#039;d be able to say that about something that lasts all of three episodes, but it does. There are long stretches of scenes that just show random objects or filled with scene after scene where nothing of value happens. You could probably cut this down to a single episode if you only kept the relevant parts. Don&#039;t expect actual horror from this either. A lot of what happens is strange and/or kind of nonsensical but not frightening. There are some scenes that have promise, but the effect they could have had ends up getting spoiled by random object cuts and pointless scenes. <br />
<br />
The characters are pretty dull. Eiri and Cosette are really the only ones who matter, possibly Mataki if you stretch the meaning of “matter.” They could have developed the characters if they had spent less time on pointless moments, but they don&#039;t. They start out as  stock characters and experience very little growth as things progress. <br />
<br />
The art is pretty good. The random shifts and transitions may not do anything from a story perspective, but the things they cut to are drawn well. There are a lot of really good details in the backgrounds as well. Which I paid close attention to as nothing of merit was happening in the foreground most of the time. The character art looks pretty good as well. The biggest issue with the art comes when they try to do a “scary” scene and random objects of wildly shifting art styles start coming at you. Which just looks odd. Their attempt at drawing a monster, which oddly enough has a negligible effect on the plot, just looks silly. I honestly laughed out loud when I first saw it. They also like to do randomly tilted shots throughout the series. Which just look stupid and out of place. <br />
<br />
The voice acting ranges quite a bit in quality. Inoue Marina gives an excellent performance, and it&#039;s the only aspect of the OVA that actually comes across as creepy. But then you have Saiga Mitsuki and Toyoguchi Megumi who are just okay. You also have Ebara Masashi who, thankfully, only appears in one scene in which he over-acts like hell. I know he can act, I&#039;ve heard him do it in Xenosaga and Fullmetal Alchemist, to name a couple examples. The effects, are not at the level of the acting. They try to create this disconcerting cacophony, but it just ends up spoiling the effect in a lot of cases. Inoue Marina will be delivering her lines in a genuinely creepy way, but then the effects will make her voice sound tinny, for lack of a better term, and the creepiness will be gone or the effects will be louder than the character voices and it&#039;ll be hard to hear what they&#039;re doing. The music is just pretty typical of “horror” fare. <br />
<br />
The ho-yay factor is a 1/10. This has no ho-yay. The cast is overwhelmingly female, but they can&#039;t be bothered to develop their relationships in any way, romantic or otherwise. Most of the male characters only appear in a scene or two. <br />
<br />
This is the best anime I&#039;ve seen in the past four weeks. Which admittedly isn&#039;t saying much since the other anime were the two first series of Sekirei and Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari. The bottom line is that there are some moments that could have been effective but they&#039;re diluted by a whole lot of pointless scenes and random transitions. Still, I do recommend watching it, with two or three friends. Why? Because Le Portrait de Petit Cosette lies in that realm of dullness and semi-stupidity that makes for excellent snark material. Watch it to poke fun at it and it will lead to entertaining moments for you and friends. But as a serious horror piece I have to give it a 4/10. It&#039;s mostly just pretty dull but inoffensive. Horror anime month will continue next week with a look at the only horror anime on my request queue, Blue Gender.

    The art in this anime is outstanding! But that&#039;s about all it has going for it. It&#039;s an anime that you just have to hate it or like it. The story line is confusing but as it goes on its a little bit more understandable. I definetly wouldn&#039;t recommend watching the dubbed version. I also dont get the fact that a French woman understands and speaks Japanese. Some of the characters are nerve racking and also not needed in the story line. Overall this isnt a terrible anime but no where near the best.

    Even if you don&#039;t like/watch anime, I assure you Le Portrait De Petite Cossette would blow your mind. Very mature and serious, something that is hard to find on anime, but still has that wild fantasy atmosphere with demons and art that could only be found in anime (and of course that Lolita character which, again, could only be found in anime) so both anime lover and non-lover could enjoy this OVA very much (yeah it&#039;s not anime, but OVA, only 3 episodes).<br />
<br />
Other than beautiful and and wild art, Yuki Kajiura as the composer of this anime&#039;s soundtrack had done an amazing job by composing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180872">
        a Gothic, solemn, dark, and classic European sounded like music, but manage to add Japanese characteristic to it. I downloaded the OST. too and fell in love with it, Miss Kajiura is a genius, Houseki of course being the best.<br />
<br />
While very much enjoyable, the storyline might be a little bit difficult to follow thus you need to watch it without blinking your eyes, especially on the last episode. And seems like Eiri and Cossette were the only characters in here while the other girls were additional, maybe so it could have more than just two characters. They don&#039;t add much to the story though.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a must wathc for anyone who loves something dark, Gothic, horror, psychological, yet romantic.

    This is the. Most. Disturbing. Anime. I. Have. Ever. Seen.  I saw the first of this three-episode miniseries, and I&#039;m NOT planning to watch the rest.<br />
<br />
A young man falls in love...with a glass goblet?  He can&#039;t explain just why.  He carries it with him everywhere; looks at it, fondles it.  But soon this goblet starts affecting him, giving him dreams.  Is there a young girl&#039;s spirit trapped inside?  What does she want from him?  What plans remain unfulfilled from her life?<br />
<br />
It seemed interesting at first, with the mystery surrounding the goblet.  And the animation style was very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29437">
        artsy and interesting.  (It was attractive enough that I raised my rating from, say, a 3 to a 5)  But as the episode progressed, it became very disturbing.  It entered surrealist scapes, littered with discolored human bones and body parts.  Blood gushes, bodies mutate, imagery of death and fear seep and sop.  The &quot;weird&quot; twists normalcy.  By the end, I wanted to vomit.<br />
<br />
So I&#039;d only recommend this if you can stomach super-horror.  The style was attractive at first.  And the story could end up being interesting.  But I&#039;m not going to spend my time on it.  I&#039;d rather keep my cookies where they belong.

    Worst love story with a lot of girls and no plot. <br />
The characters have no depth or logic to them. They are all just like mmorpg classes and they all have random abilities for no particular reason. Characters pop in and out. The guy called Eiri in the anime is a pathetic loser like one of those guys who will do anything for a girl even though she wouldn’t even try to remember his name. The girl called Cossete sounds like a manipulative egocentric narcissist who believes the world turns around her or something. <br />
The art is oke and it has some good music.<br />

    This had a very interesting and deep plot, along with awesome music and artwork. The characters were certainly a collective bunch, I&#039;ll give it that. And I think everyone knew that Mataki had feelings for Eiri, which is more than likely the reason why the Cossette used her in the third episode. I really want to read the manga next, because I am told it explains things in greater detail. All in all, I loved it and would watch it again in a heartbeat.

    While working for his uncle at an antique shop. An art student named Eiri comes across a beautiful small goblet. He begins to see an image of a young girl in the reflection of the glass. Eiri soon learns that the girl inside of the glass named Cossette was brutally murdered 250 years ago. After Eiri makes a blood pact with Cossette. The spirits whom witnessed her murder seek vengeance on the murderer&#039;s soul, and their intentions are to use Eiri as their instrument. Eiri soon vows to help Cossette even though it may end his life.-<br />

At first glance, when coming into this short OVA

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185096">
        the viewer will find themselves in awe with the production values. Le Portrait de Petit Cossette aka Petite Cossette is a beautiful assault on all of the senses. The moving soundtrack was done by Noir composer Yuki Kajiura, so one whom is familiar with her work already knows to expect a quality soundtrack. The BGM compliments the dark and Gothic setting, with classical pieces consisting of eerie piano keys and chords. Visually, the series is a work of art and it&#039;s leaps beyond the usual short episode OVA format. The artwork is gorgeous with Cossette&#039;s character design being influenced by the Victorian Era of 1830&#039;s Europe.<br />
<br />
The animation is a sight to see with fluid character movements, and the cinematography is also well used when displaying images, as well as character reflections through and off glass with amazing camera angles. This is also in combination with a vibrant color palette. The style of the series reminds me of both Soul Taker and Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo. If I was the type of viewer whom prefered visuals over a story, then this would be among my favorites.<br />
<br />
Now getting to the story, which is the soul of any form of visual entertainment in my view. The style of storytelling present in this short OVA may turn away plenty of viewers. Although the story itself is rather simple, in which it&#039;s a tale of blind love, utilizing the dark themes of obsession and revenge with a supernatural backdrop. The route taken seems almost as if the writers wanted to confuse the viewer. The story is delivered in flashbacks, visions, illusions, and dialogue, which makes it difficult to tell exactly what is going on. This really isn&#039;t a bad approach, however in the case of the less patient or action oriented. It will leave them with very little reason to care what&#039;s going on. Personally, I have nothing against this style of non linear storytelling, because it&#039;s actually a refreshing change once in awhile. I commend the screenwriter Mayori Sekijima and director Akiyuki Shimbo for taking a simple premise and turning it into a half way or so brain twister; but I&#039;ve seen this done far better.<br />
<br />
I liked the themes that the series works on, because it pretty much shows it can lead to a destructive path. However, the writing tip toes very close to the realm of horror. These darker themes are exploited through torture sequences and even murder; butI feel that these scenes along with the blood and gore are greatly exaggerated. It&#039;s nowhere near disturbing or brutal as others describe it from where I see it. To me, it kind of loses its effectiveness due to constant overuse.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t believe the characters were properly used. As it should be, the main characters Cossette and Eiri, are the only ones whom are focused on and actually developed; but in the case of Eiri, it&#039;s very hard to buy into him because I can&#039;t see someone falling in love with a girl he doesn&#039;t know, and is willing to give his life for her as well. There simply wasn&#039;t enough work put into this story element, and I feel it wasn&#039;t properly fleshed out. I think the character development was sloppy, and the disposable secondary cast could have used less screen time, because they were poorly developed and most served no purpose at all.<br />
<br />
Even though personally I&#039;m not bothered by it too much; others may be very disturbed by the Lolita thing going on between Eiri and Cossette. Eiri is obviously an adult over 18, while Cossette appears to be around 12 years old. I understand this is accepted in some parts but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll ever be completely use to that.<br />
<br />
Petite Cossette is a series that had potential and could have been a lot better, but I don&#039;t praise things due to what it could have been. I will give credit in areas and that&#039;s about it. So the series isn&#039;t a failure from where I see it, but it&#039;s far from great. I do not for any reason recommend this to the action oriented. This is not an action themed series on any level, it&#039;s a drama using horror-ish elements. I think this will mainly appeal to those with patience, and die hard otakus who must see everything anime. <br />
<br />
Highs: Outstanding visuals and soundtrack, cinematography<br />
<br />
Lows: Undeveloped secondary characters, style will not appeal to many

    It is absolutely incomprehensible to me that some people are giving this anime a 9 or a 10. I couldn&#039;t disagree more. I didn&#039;t like this anime at all, and that&#039;s not at all because I don&#039;t like the genre. Quite the opposite, actually- creepy dead girls, dark, bloody and loads of symbolism is 100% my jam- but this anime was just bad.<br />
<br />
This anime was very, very weird. It wasn&#039;t actually creepy or scary at any point- just weird.<br />
<br />
The story was strange and has basically zero twists. If you read the back of the box the DVD comes in you know the whole story.<br />
<br />
This anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286436">
        is quite graphically dated and it shows. It hasn&#039;t aged well and looks like crap compared to any remotely modern anime.<br />
<br />
The English voice acting is mediocre and the well below average writing doesn&#039;t do it any favors.<br />
<br />
But the worst sin of all is that this anime is simply boring. Nothing really happens. You just watch a bunch of weird nothingness for two hours and that&#039;s pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Yuki Kajiura&#039;s soundtrack is amazing, as it always is, because she&#039;s a deity among mere mortals in the world of video game and anime music composition, but it&#039;s nowhere near enough to save what is otherwise a really bad show. It&#039;s two hours of my life I&#039;ll never get back.<br />
<br />
+Excellent Yuki Kajiura soundtrack<br />
<br />
-EVERYTHING else<br />
<br />
Watch at your own risk...<br />
<br />
OBJECTIVE RATING- 3 at best<br />
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 3 because soundtrack, 1-2 otherwise

    &quot;Who loves me so much that he would forsake his own dear life... could it be you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tagline! This magical girl series is sure to win the heart of any GothLoli who&#039;s ever longed for a sado-masochistic relationship! Never since Hell Girl have we seen so warped a transformation sequence as this!<br />
<br />
   So, just an fyi folksies - this whole review is SPOILER FRIENDLY. And the spoilers start right now...<br />
<br />
SPOILER BELOW:<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s how to solve the riddle: once you&#039;ve finished the seires, go back and watch the first 15 seconds. Mostly everything you need to know takes place there, but I&#039;ll break it down anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53559">
        loves me so much that he would forsake his own dear life... could it be you? If someone were to drown in the sea for me, I would be released from the stone, back to life. I would return to life. But if someday I were to be reborn into a life that gives me what is most dear to me... ...then I would cry alone. I would cry alone, seeking what was my stone. [With a terrible lyricist no doubt...] Even if my blood was as ripe as fine wine, what good would I be?  [plenty good to the vampires of Forks, Wa. my dear lady!] .Because I can&#039;t bring back from the depths of the sea the person who most loved me. [I LOVE YOU EDWARD CULLEN! And I you, ...werewolf guy!]&quot; <br />
<br />
  French aristocrat Cossette falls for Marcelo, an Italian artist who stays with her family. He find her to be the epitome of Beauty and paints several portraits of her. She falls for him, of course, and the two become engaged (why her family allows her to take up with a mooching artist I don&#039;t fully understand - he wasn&#039;t a particularly good one). He loves her as well, except what he loves is her beauty and youth, not who she really is.<br />
   So, inevitably during the course of his last portrait he fall madly in love... with his work; and  once it is finished he decides that he cannot abide to her growing older, so he does what any sensible mad artist would in his position [alt. version: so he does the only reasonable thing he can think of and] and slaughters her along her whole family (for good measure) so that she will remain forever young and beautiful. <br />
     Which is just fucked up enough for her to become a vengeful spirit that eventually finds our protagonist (he&#039;s Marcelo&#039;s reincarnation - SURPRISE!) and bequeath him with the Eternal damnation of pain and suffering (FUN!) through the &#039;memories&#039; of the objects that witnessed the betrayal so long ago (she has very loyal cupboards). Each one witnesses said betrayal from a different perspective and so keeps a different &#039;memory&#039; of what happened, who whom and forms an opinion of how badly the protagonists should suffer because of it. Protagonist is a masochist with Stockholm Syndrome, so he naturally falls deeply in love with his imaginary tormentor. Keep in mind that however dark or surreal this anime becomes it is still a Magical Girl series at heart, so keep an eye out for the twisted transition &quot;quick change&quot; sequence (please see Hell Girl for another example of this art form).<br />
<br />
   Later, when we get to the clock phase we see Cossette grow older, which is an interesting plot &#039;twist&#039; and Eiri Kurahashi (protagonist torture unit) states that he loves Cossette and will no longer fight against the torture since it means being with her (he is related to a madman, it&#039;s just a different kind of crazy here).   A while later she falls in love with him and decides that she doesn&#039;t want him to suffer the way Christ did and decides to leave the poor man be. This is where it gets even more fun!<br />
<br />
    So, I forgot to mention it but there&#039;s a &quot;love interest&quot; (by love interest we mean she loves and he&#039;s obviously not interested as he has fallen for Dorian Grey&#039;s prototype). She pretty much only comes in to shout his name and get angry at him. And her age seems to change as often as her name does; I spent most of the anime thinking she was his mother or older sister or something and if that wasn&#039;t confusing enough different people refer to her by different names (family + given) and the way it is executed meant I spent the whole anime thinking there was &quot;Mataki - her&quot; the older cranky aunt and &quot;Shouko&quot; a faceless fellow student (same age) who loves him. Little did I know they were the same person the whole time!! And not only that - it turns out that she is the reincarnation of Cossette (or at least she becomes her later - it isn&#039;t clear which).<br />
<br />
Also, remember the painting that Marcelo was so madly in love with? Well, it turns out it reciprocated with the passion of 1000 fiery suns! And not only that - it&#039;s the jealous type! So we discover, far too long afterward, that Kurahashi was tricked into thinking Cossette came back for him and decided to love him for eternity. Except it was the painting the whole time, angry and jealous that Marcelo&#039;s reincarnation loved the real Cossette instead of it. But once he figures it out he beats it pretty quick - how one might ask? Well that&#039;s easy, he just says he implies that he loves the real Cossette for who she is and then paints her portrait with his own blood (still related to Marcelo, still crazy). This is apparently a &quot;warmer&quot; likeness and so it defeats the evil painting, thereby taking out the dreaded curse and it is implied that everyone lives ... surreally ever after.<br />
<br />
This is an odd anime, particularly because I couldn’t tell if it took itself seriously or not. On the one hand, it seems as though the artist just finished taking a course in Surrealism and wanted to apply it somewhere without fully understanding the best method of execution. Then on the other hand we have perverse magical girl transformation sequences and (this is my favourite part of the anime) a scene toward the end of the first episode where Kurahashi actually passes a wall in an alleyway on the way home from dropping off the folio that has been tagged “Gothic and Lolita

    Le Portrait de Petite Cosette explains that a picture really is worth a thousand words, this 3 part OVA, which I watched in the form of a movie was very detailled and artistically haunting to the touch.<br />
<br />
We follow a young man named Eiri (Eerie? Pun intended much?)<br />
There are a lot of gory scenes of the story, most very central yet some wer random at best.<br />
<br />
Yet the scenes of which portrayed the most misery and pain for Eiri weren&#039;t actually the scary ones.<br />
<br />
A must recommend for those interested in mystery horror type stories.

    Overwhelmingly Beautiful in its Dark Poetry. <br />
The criticism I&#039;m hearing most about &quot;Cossette no Shouzou&quot; is that it&#039;s random. That it means nothing. That they - the unhappy viewer - needs more from their anime than random events strewn together without logic. As if the road to nowhere is not interesting in and of itself to them. It makes me wonder, why don&#039;t we expect our concept of narrative to be challenged more in the anime we consume? Why don&#039;t we put forth as much effort in confronting art, as the artist has put forth in confronting us? <br />
<br />
the story is  about a young

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227704">
        man uncovers a delicate Venetian glass that holds a startling secret within: a haunted beauty, named Cossette, has been waiting 250 years for someone to set her spirit free. The man soon becomes obsessed and determined to help the girl trapped inside the crystal, but the necessary physical and psychological sacrifices might be too great for him to bear.<br />
<br />
We are talking visual poetry here. For almost the entire 3 eps, every square inch of screen is minutely painted. Ordinary criticism doesn&#039;t apply, there is no comparison between this and any other anime.<br />
So many scenes have you holding your breath in awe. The smallest movement of light is choreographed precisely, the glass, the paintings, the dolls..these are not simply images of those things, but the ungraspable nature of life, beauty, love, memory. So much more lies beneath the surface, as we are shown a reflection in a glass that momentarily purports to be reality, but need not necessarily be interpreted as such. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not easy to make such judgments, but this is my favorite anime. A personal choice, for sure, but what Cossette no Shouzou achieves is the height of poetry and literature. Its final moment, if it works for you (and I can imagine it wouldn&#039;t for all), is a success of the &quot;method of indirection&quot; sought by poetry. Its effect is cumulative and devastating.<br />
<br />
I cannot recommend this anime highly enough. It&#039;s truly fascinating but you need to be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the &quot;total work of art,&quot; or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential anime.<br />

    I loved the attention to detail of the drawing and filming style of this anime, especially in the first episode. Each scene is framed up very artistically, to match the main character&#039;s personality. Often having the camera set behind, looking through and in reflections of the objects in the antique shop in which he worked, often giving the feeling that we are one of the trinkets looking in at the scene.<br />
<br />
The visual style is what kept me interested in the show, but the plot line got confusing as the main character (Eiri) is transfixed by the painting of Cossette, but then a Venetian glass. He

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15327">
        falls in love with the haunted girl of the painting and gets sucked into her world. It then takes on a Jigoku Shoujo (Hell Girl), The Grudge king of ghost haunting story.  <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a short 3 volume anime, but well worth the time to enjoy the camera shots and details and of course the adorable gothic lolita.

    Well, this is another fine show done by the perverted old man Shinbo. He is pretty much known for his little girls and for anything that had to deal with mind games. Some of the shows he has done like this include Dance in the Vampire Bund, Negima, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, and Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase. This is a mindgame with a young girl.<br />
<br />
If we want to talk about characters, the only ones that mean anything are Eiri Kurahashi and Cossette. There really isn’t much in the story that shows just who these people are actually and so the characters seem bland. We do get story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64177">
        line from Cossette but nothing that actually shows her personality. She is just a little girl but she is nothing innocent at all. It’s like she’s a demon the way she acts around Eiri and by the second episode, I stopped feeling sorry for her because she became like the no name Elfen Lied girls. All she really did was torture porn. Even though she is rather young, has the heart of a jaded lover inside her. She is rather manipulative and a strange trickster. <br />
<br />
Eiri isn’t much better, in fact, he’s worse. We get no info on his back story or personality, nothing about his friends that he was around in the beginning (we only see them once) and the girls that he’s around are bland and again, we hear nothing about how they are together. It’s just boring. There wasn’t something for me to grasp onto so I was sitting there laughing about how stupid he was for throwing his life away for someone he barely knew. <br />
<br />
The storyline would have been better if it was either longer with more detail in the story, or a movie. I would choose the first since a movie like this may be a little two hard to do. It’s sad you can’t feel for any of the characters at all.<br />
<br />
The artwork is rather pretty, the details striking. Cossette seems to feel more like a doll in some parts though, much too pretty and porcelain like with her pale skin and sweet eyes. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit to oil paint-ish in a lot of parts. When that happens, they look like still shots. The only thing that really awesome is the shots. It’s a lot of surreal angles and out of control beauty where we don’t see the stupid looking characters in the back room. Mostly, I think this was done with the idea that they wouldn’t have to animate much.<br />
<br />
The music is hunting and playful, almost like a music box. The English voice acting sounds rather well done. Maybe a bit too well then it has any business being, although it does start to sound cheesy when they start talking in poetics. There are a lot of questions that keep being said throughout the show and sometimes I thought it was much better when I didn’t try to think too much.<br />

    Story:<br />
It&#039;s utterly and completely a satire. It&#039;s making fun of people who look at pretentious pieces of work by creating a character, Eire, who is absolutely infatuated with Cossette who has no depth, value, or substance. The only thing she has to offer is death, and for some ungodly reason, he still pursues her.<br />
<br />
For instance, those who look at this work and see it as a work of art beyond itself are merely playing into the folly of its beauty. This statement is incredibly ironic due to the fact that Cossette no Shouzou in itself is filled with depth and meaning but not in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212588">
        sense that most people may pick up on right away.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what we do as an audience when we fall in love with something that is not worthy of its praise. We kill it, replace it with our own image, and then from then on out it&#039;s forever this new thing that isn&#039;t anything close to the original. It&#039;s something we do with all forms of media we love, but worst of all we do it with people.<br />
<br />
The ending helps solidify this notion by mentioning the fact that people cannot unite. This further iterates the notion mentioned above that we kill the things we love based solely on their outward expression and not on what they actually are. We&#039;ve separated our ability to truly unite with that individual because we&#039;ve already killed who they are from our perspective.<br />
<br />
I could get into detail further about how this story repeats these themes, but I&#039;ll stop myself here. Now that you&#039;re aware of them, the excitement is looking around for these themes throughout the work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Overcrowded yet sufficient. Since the art is trying to convey the above message by showing how our infatuation with visuals is far beyond what a work actually offers, it makes a lot of sense for it to be overly abundant. However, this is ironic due to the nature that it itself has grabbed hold of so many people due to visuals alone. I find this unfortunate, but also to be expected. There&#039;s a point in which I must wonder whether the work is self-aware of this or not. There are many points where I can say yes, but there are a few in which I can also say it is not.<br />
<br />
There is an offensively high amount of repeated animations. This is ridiculous. With a work that puts so much effort into essentially bastardizing overly constructed visuals, I wonder why it couldn&#039;t create, you know, another overly abundant visual in place of these repeat animations. Perhaps there&#039;s something to be said about this in relation to the theme, but I&#039;m coming up short on this end.<br />
<br />
Some proportions are way off. Characters look pretty bad in a few scenes. It&#039;s laughable.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The levels on this are atrocious. Sounds are sometimes WAY to loud and others WAY to quiet. I am 100% it is not due to something on my end, so whoever was in control of the Sound Production totally screwed up on this part.<br />
<br />
Yuki Kajiura has no ability to write unique music. All of her soundtracks sound unbelievably similar. I could take this OST and place it in any of her other works (that have the same tone) and it wouldn&#039;t sound out of place at all. This is incredibly unfortunate. She has an ability to create pretty intricate orchestrations, but her music shouldn&#039;t sound similar to the point of identical in each work. I&#039;m not buying Yuki Kajiura albums. If this were a Yuki Kajiura album, then yes I&#039;d want relatively similar songs. I am watching an anime, however, and a visual art needs to have unique themes and melodies that cannot be swapped out with another productions music. I almost want to avoid any films or anime she&#039;s written music for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Considering Eire is just a placeholder to represent the audience, I can&#039;t really say much of him. I can, however, explain a very early reason for why he is the audience. Within the first half of the first episode, you seldom see him when he talks. The characters around him are the main focus while his voice is off camera. The way the angle is set up is almost as if you are him. There&#039;s this sense that you are supposed to be him. I feel this is the first of many signs that imply what this entire project is about.<br />
<br />
Cossette&#039;s character is a bitch. I don&#039;t understand why Eire loved her. There was no chemistry. I know I said this is a commentary and they are all placeholders but the truth still stands that characters need to be believable to create a solid story, and there are definitely ways these characters could have been believable.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a host of side characters that get very little screen time. I&#039;m sure they each represent something but I felt they were nothing more than plot devices. A character should not feel like a plot device to the degree that I recognize it instantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Honestly, hated watching it. I found every character to be unlikeable and there was no urgency to save Cossette from limbo considering the only reason was Eire loved her. And that reason was unbelievable to me because I found his love to be superficial and ridiculous. This made it very difficult to watch and the only reason I continued is because I refuse to drop an anime. I will, at some point, watch all of the anime I have started.<br />
<br />
However, as I wrote this review, I got to thinking about what I&#039;d actually watched, the possible message that was told, and the themes mentioned over and over and I came to realize that the story is quite brilliant. I feel as though the execution is filled with flaws that could have easily been fixed, but all in all, I am not disappointed that I watched this anime. Despite the low score I gave it, I&#039;m sure to suggest this to my friends.<br />
<br />

    In Japan, it’s said that if a previously prized item has been abandoned for over 100 years, it comes to life, developing it’s own soul, born from the tragedy of it’s loneliness.  If this is true, then you can only imagine the kind of forlorn souls that haunt your average antique shop.  Of course, you don’t have to imagine it if you get a job at one of these locations, like Eiri Kurahashi does when he takes a job at his Grandfather’s shop to help pay his way through art school.  Honestly, it’s not such a bad job, either.  He works

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256965">
        near his friends, a lovely young woman often rents the space outside for her tarot card readings, and all he really has to deal with is his grandfather’s compulsive purchases, as the worldly old man is constantly buying up antiques on his travels to sell at his shop for obscene and mostly arbitrary price markups.  <br />
<br />
One day, he receives a piece from his Grandfather’s trip to Europe, and while it looks like a simple piece of furniture at first, he soon finds out that the piece contains two hidden items...  The first is a lovely glass chalice whose rim is tinted with an enchanting swirl of colors, and the second is an exquisite painting of a little white girl, dressed up in gothic lolita clothing like a porcelain doll.  Eiri quickly starts to lose himself in this glass, and not too long afterward, he begins to see that same little girl moving around inside of the glass, presenting him with a glimpse into many different moments of her young life, from the innocent to the sad, and to make matters more bizarre, she seems to be completely aware of his presence...  Whatever he’s seeing, it’s undeniably what she wants him to see, but the lovestruck Eiji may not be feeling what she wants him to feel.  As he continues to get drawn deeper and deeper into the haunted chalice’s mystery, and he uncovers more and more about a centuries old crime, can his body survive the strain that this new liaison is taking on his soul?<br />
<br />
Le Portrait de Petite Cossette was produced by the animation company Daume, which I’ve only spoken about once before, but that was before I started to adopt a consistent structure in my reviews, so I didn’t mention it at the time.  For the record, that anime was Shiki, and the similarities are there, although thank God Cossette doesn’t have the same wacky design problems.  Daume unfortunately didn’t exist for very long, as it was only active between 1999 and 2010, but from the few titles I have seen, their priorities seem to be pumping out trashy low budget ecchi shows, and saving the bulk of their money for more serious projects, like this, Shiki, and Strawberry Marshmallow, and with these titles, they put a lot of money and effort into animation quality and background detail, creating as realistic and immersive a tone as possible for the stories and characters that people will actually care about, leaving the titty shows that people will watch anyway to suffer the short end of the stick, and I can definitely respect that.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, when it comes to Cossette’s visual style, it looks far more like a product of it’s director than it does it’s production company.  Akiyuki Shinbou has a rather controversial reputation among anime fans, and while Cossette was his only real undertaking for Daume, he’s spent the majority of his career working for Studio Shaft, where his eclectic visual style has become synonymous with his name.  He’s built his career on using strange, unorthodox cinematography to make dialogue scenes look just weird and off-putting enough to distract the viewer from noticing just how little is actually going on in said scenes, and he’s been called pretentious because of this trend...  And not unfairly, either, it’s a label he well deserves.  His other constant quirk is that he likes to present female characters, especially underage ones, in sexually appealing poses, regardless of what kind of tone the project is going for.  His direction was, interestingly enough, one of the biggest criticisms that Madoka Magika received.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, his visual trademarks can be used for good.  His style added a lot of depth to EF: A Tale of Memories and it’s sequel, but even further back, he did a fantastic job on Le Petite Cossette.  There are a lot of visual effects in this production that feel essential to the story, such as intense shadow play and intricate lighting, as well as a lot of CG glass effects and dream like backgrounds, and I honestly can’t think of any other anime director with the broad vision and even broader scope of imagination to pull it off as well as Shinbou does.  His unorthodox visual style doesn’t feel wasted or arbitrary here, as it’s a story about art that’s being presented in as artistically daring a way as possible, and there’s some kind of meaning, no matter how small, that can be inferred from every off kilter shot of it.  This is of course not to say the series was low budget, or anything...  In the moments that rely on traditional movement, it looks fine.  It doesn’t look cheaply made, or like they were struggling, or anything like that.  I don’t know if i’d call this the best looking piece of Shinbou’s career, but it’s gotta be up there.<br />
<br />
With only three episodes ever made, Le Petite Cossette doesn’t have a very large soundtrack, but what it does have is hauntingly beautiful.  I shouldn’t really have to expand much farther than that, at least not once I drop the name Yuki Kajiura, one of the most celebrated soundtrack composers in anime history, and her work for Cossette is no exception.  While the instrumentations themselves are heart-breaking and exquisitely orchestrated, a lot of it’s tracks are songs with actual people singing lyrics, which is definitely not something you’d expect from most anime.  I wasn’t able to find out who sang every track, I could only place names to a few of them, but from what I was able to gather, the singing duties appear to have been split between Kajiura herself and Cossette’s Japanese voice actor, Marina Inoue, both of whom prove to be outstandingly talented singers.  There are a few exceptions to this, of course, and I’m pretty sure my favorite track is “Somewhere I Belong,” whose violin chords convey a very real sense of longing and loneliness.<br />
<br />
The English dub is a very fine effort from Geneon, which I regret to say was never one of my favorite dubbing companies when it was still around.  I was never a fan of how a lot of their dubs felt really samey, and quite a few of them tried way too hard to match the Japanese voices, resulting in awkward, sometimes screechy sounding deliveries.  This particular project, led by director Wendee Lee, is a much more subtle effort than I’m used to from them, and I’d even go as far as to say it’s almost as good as the Japanese.  One thing that I feel they greatly improved on is the casting of Eiri, who was for some reason played by a woman in Japanese, and yeah, it wasn’t very convincing.  They gave the job to veteran Johnny Yong Bosch in the dub, and...  You know that thing he does sometimes where he talks without any real inflections, but his voice is still entirely listenable due to how hypnotically soft it is?  That works to great effect when playing his character in the real world, bored and distant as he yearns for the world inside the glass.  Appropriately enough, he speaks with a lot more enthusiasm and genuine interest when speaking to Cossette.<br />
<br />
And speaking of Cossette, Michelle Ruff plays that role, and while she kind of faltered when playing a similar role in Chobits, she actually gives Cossette a bit more personality than her original VA Marina Inoue did, although that could be chalked up to Ruff being an established star at the time and Inoue having just debuted.  She plays her role a bit more playfully than Inoue did, and when the time came, she also delivered on the duality of the character nicely.  Unfortunately, aside from Tony Oliver’s terrifying portrayal of murderer Marcello Orlando, the rest of the cast feels kind of wasted in smaller roles, including industry heavyweights like Kari Wahlgren, Kirk Thornton, Sam Riegal, Julie Ann Taylor and even Wendee Lee herself, put on strong, subtly emotional performances, considering the limited screen time they were all given.  The English adapted script is also more than faithful enough.  Yeah, there’s some philosophical changes in episode 3, but they’re workable.  The sub is better overall, but both versions are equally listenable.<br />
<br />
You know what we don’t have enough of?  Stories where people fall in love with ghosts.  I absolutely love reading about or just watching the idea of love conquering all getting challenged by the barrier of mortality between the two lovers in question.  One of my favorite books growing up was Robert Westall’s The Promise, which was about an English boy falling in love with a beautiful classmate during world War 1, only for her to become a casualty of the legendary conflict.  She comes back as a ghost, they’re still in love, and their attempts to rekindle their mortal romance nearly leads him to death’s door.  He ultimately must choose between his life and his love, which is the kind of emotional dilemma I could die for.  no, that doesn’t make me a Twilight fan, because vampires have physical bodies, and that would be cheating.  Also, Twilight sucks.  <br />
<br />
To be honest, though, Le Portrait de Petite Cossette has one of Twilight’s biggest flaws, in the fact that it features a love connection between a couple who are separated not just by death, but by an uncomfortable age range.  Yeah, in all fairness, Cossette was killed over 200 years prior to the story, but she’s still clearly a child Eiri still falls in love with her, and while their specific ages are never explained, it’s very likely that eiri is in his late teens or early twenties, while Cossette died between ages 10 and 12, creating a romance that would normally set off my lolicon alarm, if it wasn’t for what the writer was trying to do with it.  Taking a look at Cossette’s background, she was the oldest child of an aristocratic family, and she was also a child bride, which was a common enough practice in those days.  Her fiance was a family portrait artist who had fallen in love with her after several art sessions, and while the art we’re shown is fairly innocent, there’s a pretty decent chance he was also putting her in some Leo and Kate/Pretty Baby poses when her parents weren’t looking.<br />
<br />
Now, it’s kind of a spoiler, but I’m sorry, I have to talk about her death, and honestly, it’s not even that BIG of a spoiler, as I’ll still be leaving the entire third episode a surprise for you...  One day, her artist fiance, Marcello Orlando, goes crazy and slaughters her family before killing her, because...  Once again, I’m sorry, but here’s the spoiler...  Because she was aging.  Yeah, he stabs her through the chest with a huge knife to keep her from growing up, because if she did, she would no longer look like the girl he’d fallen in love with, the girl in his portraits.  When you add this to the fact that Eiri’s obsession with a little girl who wasn’t real and complete ignorance of the real life woman who’s in love with him feels like a very intentional metaphor for lolicon media and how it indulges a person’s socially unacceptable fantasies to the point of seclusion, this all becomes the most brilliant condemnation of pedophilia and lolicon culture that I’ve ever seen.  Well, from anime, at least...  The movie Hard Candy does a pretty solid job, too.<br />
<br />
And for those of you who are trying to be smart and point out that the main character also falls in love with a little girl, well, he doesn’t come out of this unscathed either.  Yeah, his love for Cossette is portrayed as being more pure than Marcello’s...  Which isn’t too difficult when you’re being compared to a murderer...  But the idea of his love is still shown through the same kind of lens, as it’s ultimately a delusion.  Even if the idea of an adult having a physical or romantic relationship with a child wasn’t wholly reprehensible...  Which it unquestionably is...  It’s fundamentally impossible for an adult who’s attracted to children to have a substantial relationship with one, as children don’t stay children forever.  This is why the anime is named after Cossette’s portrait, rather than Cossette herself...  Because it has a duel meaning. her portrait, in this equation, is symbolic of lolicon art, and to a more unsettling extent, child porn.  Cossette says at one point in the ova that she hates having her portrait done, and can you blame her?  She was killed over the fact that she, as a person, could never have the same kind of eternal youth that her portrait had.  This ties into the portrait’s second meaning...  It’s her.  The portrait, like her, is a ghost of something that once was, and can never be again.<br />
<br />
Of course, it also helps that Cossette as a character is never sexualized, or presented to us in a sexually suggested manner.  I guess Shinbou did have a sense of restraint and taste at one point.  We’re shown how she seduces Eiri, because she needs a man to fall far enough in love with her to willingly sacrifice himself to the torture and punishment her killer never faced so that he soul can be at peace, but they never bother trying to seduce US with her, so points to them on that front.  They could have easily tried to have their cake and eat it too, like the use of nudity in Sankarea, but they took the high road.  I wish I could say all of the work they put toward creating their metaphor and supporting their point had resulted in a stronger story and overall better writing, but unfortunately, with only three episodes of time at their disposal, a lot of this anime’s potential wound up falling by the wayside.  I do wish the other characters would have had more time for development, seeing how there’s quite a few of them and a lot of them seem genuinely likeable, and I wish they’d drawn the story out more so that it could be enjoyable to people who DON’T want to put in the work to understand it, but what are you gonna do.<br />
<br />
Le Portrait de Petite Cossette was originally available from Geneon entertainment, and with that company long since dead and buried, it’s since been rescued and redistributed by Sentai filmworks.  Both DVDs are available for cheap online, and the only real difference between them is that the Geneon release has a pointlessly higher content rating.  You also get a nifty poster inside, which is awesome.  The manga adaptation is also available stateside from Tokyopop, and is just as easy to find online.  As far as I know, no legal streaming site is airing it.<br />
<br />
Le Portrait de Petite Cossette is, at least for what it tries to do, one of the best independent OVA series I’ve ever seen.  Despite it’s weaknesses in characterization and plot, it tells an engaging story with an important message lurking beneath the surface.  But putting all of that silly depth stuff aside, though, is this a good, spooky show to watch on Halloween?  You bet your sweet ass it is.  Despite all evidence to the contrary, you want Eiri and Cossette to reach some sort of positive conclusion at the end(Even if you understandably don’t want to see them wind up together in any way, shape or form), and you will feel legitimately frightened for both of them, as well as sympathetic to their situations.  In terms of it’s visuals, you could argue that it was ahead of it’s time, as it holds up far better now than it did when it was originally released, making it a title you really wouldn’t guess the age of, unless you judged by the actors involved.  It’s smart, complex, and a feast for the eyes, so I highly recommend adding it to your Halloween watch list.  I give Le Portrait de Petit Cossette a 8/10.

    AND THE AYES HAVE IT!!!!!<br />
…....errrr rather I mean THE EYES HAVE IT.  As in EYEBALLS.  This anime is OBSESSED with closeup shots of eyeballs.  You will see 100s by the end of the 3 films so get ready.<br />
Think I&#039;m exaggerating?<br />
<br />
OVA 1 has (I counted for you) EIGHTY close up shots of eyeballs, eyesockets of skulls, eyeglasses reflecting another person talking, and random meaningless handrawn sketches of eyeballs, eyes with blood dripping out, egyptian OSIRIS style eyes, a cat with a letter A in the eyeball, and eyeball with a red heart for the pupil and a flythrough sequence of an human eye

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322684">
        then a skull socket, then a screen of skulls, then another skull eyesockets to finally Cossette standing in the skull eyesockets.<br />
<br />
Now that we&#039;ve covered eyeballs and eyeball close-ups …<br />
…..Howdy folks, Greetings from Bullibaby.  This review is a more PRACTICAL GUIDE TO VIEWING what is kinda an anime confus-a-thon.<br />
<br />
First things first….<br />
I&#039;m definitely 100% positively sort of entirely not completely sure you should watch this OVA 3 part series but I highly recommend you probably watch it if for nothing else...but to say you did and LIVED TO TELL. <br />
<br />
And it&#039;s got some really cool graphics IF AND ONLY IF imho you do the following:<br />
----&gt;&gt;slow the whole movie down to 0.8 or 80% speed.  Hopefully your using an app that can do this without destroying the audio.  The movie should slow down, while audio sounds normal (just FYI case ya didn&#039;t know that tech exists.)<br />
<br />
Why slow it down??? because the movie is a sequence of 100’s and 100s of still shots of buildings, chairs, lamps, candles, antique lights, Paintings, Venetian goblets dangling chains and of course TONS of eyeballs with animation sequences mixed in. But even the animation chooses to cut scene changes and viewing perspectives way too often.  It&#039;s not very fluid so SLOW IT DOWN or you will honestly get dizzy.  Warning:. Daume studios was kind ENUF to include lots of REPEAT REUSE sequences as well mostly of eyeballs etc etc. (Lame)<br />
<br />
2nd viewing instruction:. If you take my 100% positively ambiguous recommendation and watch the series...you should avoid at all cost the English dub UNLESS...<br />
**you enjoy a romance horror where Cossette the most desirable woman on Earth recites her lines like reading a Denny&#039;s menu or phonebook and almost no feeling or mood, nearly monotone mostly.<br />
**Eiri the boy madly in love with a painting that wants to kill him narrated with an overtone of complete disinterest like a complacent 8th grader talking about US history.  Nevermind how MADLY in love he is, you wouldn&#039;t know it by his tone.  <br />
<br />
ANSWER:. Go Japanese with subs and the actual mood of the movie is conveyed EXCELLENTLY.  The diff between Japanese and English is profound. <br />
<br />
NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS.  if you slow it down you&#039;ll have a chance to ACTUALLY SEE some very well done scenes and animation.  It&#039;s really a paradox, there&#039;s beauty to be found in this OVA and there&#039;s plenty of issues.<br />
<br />
I personally had a favorite scene where Eire is speaking to a co-worker and your vantage point is as if you put a stained glass window up to your eye and rotated it slowly observing the characters as they talked in a kaleidoscope of colors and textures.  BEAUTIFUL. 1 of 100s of incredibly detailed complex animations definitely worth seeing for artistry sake.<br />
<br />
So about the story.  First ya gotta understand the eyeballs obsession.  I believe the reason everything is EYES and EYEBALLS is 4-fold, maybe 5-fold depending.<br />
<br />
1--The story is about marchello Orlando an artist/painter who is obsessed with the beauty in the EYE of the beholder (namely his eye) of Cossette his girlfriend.  He so obsessed he wants to freeze her beauty in time by killing her.  Hence the EVIL EYE of the beholder.<br />
<br />
2--a SINGLE 3 SECOND frame shot of a psychic entering the antique store where Cossette painting is says one line “all these objects must have souls.”  Per Wikipedia this is referring to Japanese culture that any antique abandoned and forgotten for a 100 years or more spawns it&#039;s own soul due to TRAGIC loneliness.  An ANGRY LONLYELY antique per se with souls and the EYE is the window on the soul.<br />
<br />
3--With the angry antique theory, it would seem that ALL the antiques, glassware, furniture etc present in the house where Cossette was murdered has now spawned angry souls who not only WITNESSES her murder but wish to avenge what they SAW WITH THEIR implied EYEBALLS. (If u follow).<br />
<br />
4--Take this idea one step further you&#039;ll WILL (I promise) see scenes with 100s of eyeballs and big globular floating eyes thru out the movies.  Where did all these eyeballs come from u may ask???  Well, if the eye is the window on the soul then the SOULS of all the ANTIQUES that witnessed her death are represented by the eyes in these scenes and they are all going to kill Eiri.<br />
<br />
5--Finally, Marchello Orlando believed As KRUNCHYMAN so eloquently wrote in his review describing Cossette:<br />
<br />
She is Essential. She is Beautiful. She is Perfection. She is a Muse.  <br />
Marchello only forgot SHE IS HUMAN in that list.  So it&#039;s entirely possible the eyeballs are a reference to his objectifying of cossetes VISUAL BEAUTY and they will now have THEIR revenge on machellos soul reincarnated in Eiri.<br />
<br />
Say what you will, as I said THE EYES HAVE IT.<br />
<br />
Overall, the concept was strong, the implementation was VERY weak.  I personally didnt FEEL the connection between Eire and cossette.  Eire seemed just like a total moron whose too dumb to know a bad thing when he&#039;s got iT and I thot Cossette came across as a stone cold bitch hell bent on revenge.  Imho there just wasn&#039;t ENUF character development for me to feel her loving side.<br />
<br />
Soooooo, At some point in movie 2, the REAL COSSETTE who wants to punish marchellos soul and all the EYEBALLS want to punish him as well seem to mellow and RELENT in battle. They no longer wants to torture this innocent reincarnation, at which point, Eire appears to NOW have to wage battle with The ACTUAL MYRIAD OF PAINTINGS.<br />
<br />
Now, <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not telling you this as a spoiler, but I had to rewind it three times to just understand why COSSETTE was NO LONGER Cossette, but an IMPOSTER which was the PAINTINGS THEMSELVES.  you see the IMAGES of Cossette had now begun to FIGHT for their rightful place.  You are NOT I repeat NOT told or even implied of this switch.  But to relieve your mind, I&#039;m telling you.<br />
<br />
I guess, since Marchello had exchanged Cossettes life for the life of the portraits, they had become living souls and quite frankly weren&#039;t happy with Cossette and Eiri making peace for cossettes soul.  This would have legitimized her as a human rather than a living IMAGE.  <br />
<br />
So the LIVING IMAGE of Cossette, which there are 100s of in marchellos studio, becomes personified and tries to deceive Eiri and trap him in some special CLOSED ZONE in the underworld that only they can occupy.<br />
<br />
But Eire sees thru the plot by the paintings and rejects the LIVING IMAGE IMPOSTER and proceeds to paint with his own blood a final PENNANCE for his crime.  This final act of contrition sets Cossette soul free, ends the INVASION OF THE EYEBALLS, and sets all the LIVING IMAGE IMPOSTERS on fire.<br />
<br />
HONORABLE MENTION:. Yuki Kajiura&#039;s soundtrack is amazing,<br />
<br />
For a perfect description of the actual storyline the writer probably intended...read krunchymans review.  <br />
<br />
For a practical viewing guide I humbly submit mine.<br />
<br />
Best of luck and btw ask yourself occasionallY JUST FOR FUN, where in the name of God does Eire store ALL THOSE GALLONS AND GALLONS OF BLOOD spraying everywhere. :-). <br />
