    The tripartite anthology &quot;Shikioriori&quot;, is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and recent Chinese history, in particular that of China&#039;s rapid economic development during the 1990s, so it pains me to read so many reviews that seem to exhibit no awareness and no understanding of the cultural context and demographic to which this film targets.<br />
<br />
1) Sunny Breakfast<br />
<br />
For non-Chinese people, or those who have not grown up in Chinese-influenced societies like much of South East Asia, you may not know that food is widely recognised as the most important part of Chinese culture. That Chinese people often greet each other with &quot;Have you eaten&quot; and that Chinese

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285568">
        parents will express their love for their children not with &quot;I love you&quot; but &quot;Have you eaten/there is food&quot; is merely one of the many culturally ingrained aspects of Chinese culture where food is often the basis for family bonding and socialising.<br />
<br />
In &quot;Sunny Breakfast&quot;, Xiaomin contemplates the ephemerality of people and things in life, with his most cherished experiences relating back to his favourite noodles. The whole vignette takes the form of Xiaomin&#039;s inner thoughts and soliloquising as we follow his life&#039;s journeys as we observe snippets of the memories he looks back to, as he feels his life is nothing more than a tasteless existence, that no longer has the &quot;flavour of his youth&quot; about which he reminisces and from which he begins to learn. <br />
<br />
The extended metaphor and the experiences he goes through are very much those that most ordinary Chinese people that live in cities post the late 1980s when Deng Xiaoping begun the process of transformation Shanghai to the megacity it is today. For a short story, &quot;Sunny Breakfast&quot; does well in encapsulating the experiences many young Chinese adults will have gone through and the thought processes they felt. In the whirlwind of time, it is easy to forget the impermanence of that which one grows up with and just that alone is sufficient material for a short story like the first of Shikioriori&#039;s to explore.<br />
<br />
2) A Little Fashion Show<br />
<br />
This is the most straightforward and least attached to Chinese culture of the three and may be more accessible emotionally and storywise to MAL&#039;s Western base. It is a short story about cherishing those close to you and how family, as well as recognising the bilateral nature of such relationships. Perhaps the weakest of the three, its simplicity nonetheless means that its narrative is clear even if the experience of viewing it feels a bit rushed as the plot proceeds from one to the next, with little time for the nuanced introspection and characterisation we had of Xiaomin in the previous film. <br />
<br />
I consider this to have been the weakest entry as its appeal to pathos is not  particularly convincing and could have benefitted from more introspection of the sisters rather creating an antagonist, whose purpose had little value beyond advancing the plot whose message could have been achieved without so I felt it to be more shallow than the others. Luckily, being in the middle saves &quot;Shikioriori&quot; from giving a bad first impression or a disappointing finale.<br />
<br />
3) Shanghai Love<br />
<br />
Even though it&#039;s a homage to Byousoku 5 Centimeter, I think it&#039;s more of an indictment of MAL&#039;s demographic that this film is being likened to all of Shinkai&#039;s other works when really it shares very little with any of his works. That a mere story of 2 adolescents in love that faces struggle is enough for people to liken &quot;Shanghai Love&quot; with Byousoku 5 Centimeter is more of a testament to the lack of repertoire MAL&#039;s demographic has surrouding romance as a genre where people view romance as dating and &quot;who ends up with whom&quot; rather than romance as being a medium via which to explore human relationships, emotions, and growth etc. Regardless, that doesn&#039;t change the fact that it does not come close to reaching the sheer emotional profundity and character authenticity and complexity Byousoku 5 Centimeter achieved, nor the surgical precision with which Shinkai&#039;s film explored its themes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shanghai Love&quot; is more about Shanghai and Chinese culture than it is really about love. The story surrounds 3 friends who through various circumstances end up on different life paths that lead to our protagonist to ponder on his present and future, sparked by a reminder of the past. What I found impressive in this story was the way Chinese familial structure, relationships, and familial expectations are all accurately woven in the context of 1990s Shanghai which faced rapid modernisation, gentrification as well as technological development - themes that were all deftly used as metaphors in this romantic tale.<br />
<br />
It is the longest of the three but aptly works as a conclusion to this anthology. Whereas the first focused heavily on one&#039;s past, the second on the present, this final film goes one step further using its additonal time to encompass the future and the film&#039;s ending culminates into an emotionally rewarding experience that feels like chicken soup for the soul. <br />
<br />
--Final Thoughts--<br />
<br />
Shikioriori is a Chinese production made for Chinese, or at the very least, Eastern audiences. Its audiovisuals are strong owing to its production committee and brevity but nothing exceptional. But crucially, it takes advantage of the time it has to provide a reflective and heartfelt piece about the transience of life, youth and on grasping the future, in a context that is often very ingrained within modern Chinese society. However, these themes are universal and I think audiences from all over the world can relate to the problems and feelings our protagonists hold, in a succinct package that can be digested separately in 3 parts, if you feel you don&#039;t want to commit to something long.<br />
<br />
I think for a lot of mainland Chinese millenials in their twenties, there is something even greater to pontificate upon and extract from Shikioriori, a film that I personally thoroughly enjoyed, and captured me in its reminiscent and phantasmagorical atmosphere.

    There are two things you should know about &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot;:<br />
<br />
1. It&#039;s a great anime.<br />
2. You probably won&#039;t think it&#039;s a great anime. <br />
<br />
&quot;Flavors of Youth&quot; strikes me as an inaccessible anime - particularly to western audiences - and not just because of its meandering, introspective nature that would put a lot of people to sleep. I would describe it as a cultural piece that, to fully appreciate, you not only need to know about Chinese culture, you must have been submerged in it at some point in your life. On top of that, the anime homes in on a very specific Chinese generation: the generation who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308661">
        grew up there around the 90s, the generation who witnessed China&#039;s rise to one of the world&#039;s largest economies. My generation.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that&#039;s why I struggle to recall the last anime with which I felt such a deep personal connection. &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot; captures the nostalgic feelings of my childhood spent in 90s China with such authenticity that I was utterly unsurprised to find the chief director is a Chinese close to me in age. If you&#039;re not someone targeted by the anime&#039;s laser-like focus, if you haven&#039;t the life experience of a certain time and a certain place, then &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot; likely feels like a poor man&#039;s Shinkai anime. This view is no doubt enforced by its nature as a work co-produced by CoMix Wave Films, a studio with strong associations with Shinkai. But despite the obvious influences, this anime also stands on its own three feet (because it&#039;s an anthology comprising three stories). With subtle social commentary and Chinese culture permeating through every pore, &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot; is far more than a cheap Chinese knock-off; it possesses its own identity and its own goals, with even the main locations for the stories - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, the three largest cities in China - carefully chosen as the faces of China&#039;s economic boom.<br />
<br />
The central thread that runs through the stories is &quot;youth&quot;. More accurately though, it&#039;s about &quot;seishun&quot;, or &quot;qingchun&quot; in Chinese (they use the same kanji). While those terms seem directly translatable and therefore interchangeable, that&#039;s true only in a literal sense. Words in different languages can have the same literal meaning but vastly different connotations; &quot;seishun&quot;, made up of the kanjis for &quot;green&quot; and &quot;spring&quot;, possesses a certain poetry and an association with a culturally romanticised view of the morning of one&#039;s life, and the word &quot;youth&quot; simply can&#039;t capture the strength of the meanings and feelings invoked by it.<br />
<br />
The anthology opens with &quot;The Rice Noodles&quot;, which isn&#039;t so much a story as it is an expression of feelings, subtly blended like the seasonings of a delicious bowl of the titular noodles. The bare premise is about a guy named Xiao Ming (which is, incidentally, probably the most common name for fictional protagonists used in the Chinese education system, frequently seen in example sentences and essays) yearning for the taste of the noodles of his childhood which he ate with his grandmother. The noodles do so much of the heavy lifting in this story that it&#039;s practically the main character - it has strong associations with the memories of Xiao Ming&#039;s grandmother and with the nostalgic days of his seishun, in addition to being a metaphor for the values eroded by China&#039;s rapid economic expansion. <br />
<br />
While having practically zero plot, &quot;The Rice Noodles&quot; is thematically rich. To understand the commentary, you need a bit of background. China, like a lot of Asian countries, has a strong food culture - not in the French-esq, fine dining style, but of the local street food variety. The streets and avenues are often dotted with street food stalls and cosy, family-run restaurants serving startlingly good food within tight-knit communities. As the country embarked on a decades-long growth spurt, the local restaurants got gradually replaced by more commercial restaurants and chains, particularly in large cities. On the surface level, Xiao Ming laments that the noodles from the commercial restaurants just aren&#039;t as tasty as the ones he ate as a youth, as they have less of the wholesome ingredients such as wood ear mushrooms. On a deeper level, the anime laments the loss of old values as people chase after money in an increasingly materialistic society. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t just a case of looking at the past through rose-tinted glasses: China&#039;s economic rise has very much been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty, and people&#039;s living conditions massively improved; on the other hand, since adopting aspects of a capitalist system, Chinese society has become a caricature of western consumerism, with people worshiping at the altar of money and material items, and scheming to become rich by whatever means, even at the cost of community, family and moral values. This is why the country&#039;s become plagued by scams and scandals in recent years. Where once people didn&#039;t even bother locking their doors, now they draw their curtains when counting their cash. But let&#039;s pull back from these dark reflections; &quot;The Rice Noodles&quot; does end on a positive note: even as the protagonist acknowledges that he can never recapture his seishun, the fate of the noodle shop brings hope of triumph through adversity, and of the return of non-materialistic values. Sometimes it takes a rough patch in our lives to makes us realise what is truly important.<br />
<br />
The visuals play an important part in &quot;The Rice Noodles&quot;, and it&#039;s a precursor of what&#039;s to come, both in terms of strengths and weaknesses in the animation and artwork. &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot; generally looks pretty, in a substandard-Shinkai kind of way, but falls short in the character animation department. This is particularly obvious in &quot;The Rice Noodles&quot;, where the character animation lacks smoothness in some places, and looks overly smooth and mechanical in others. I remember in particular the scenes of people perfectly poised on bicycles, peddling in perfectly cyclical motions and moving forward in perfectly straight lines. But the weaknesses are more than compensated by the details of the background scenery, where the animators managed to capture the streets and buildings of rural and urban China with remarkable fidelity. Even in the visuals, the noodles steal the show: &quot;The Rice Noodles&quot; may not exhibit the scenery porn pervading Shinkai&#039;s works, but it can boast of food porn. I found myself salivating to the beautifully rendered noodles on screen, and could almost smell the aroma wafting from it. The strength of the visuals whisked me away to distant times and places and immersed me in its scenery and atmosphere ... but the magic only works because those times and places exist in my memory.<br />
<br />
The second segment, &quot;A Little Fashion Show&quot;, has more of a plot than the first, telling the story of Yi Lin, a fashion model worrying about becoming too old for her job, and her relationship with her little sister. While not bad, it&#039;s probably the weakest of the three anthologies. I found the story a tad over-dramatic, and it resonated with me less than the others, though the reason might be because I&#039;m a guy experiencing a story dealing primarily with problems for women.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Little Fashion Show&quot; tackles the loss of seishun in a more head-on fashion than the other stories, in particular its implication for Chinese women. Age-ism is a problem for women worldwide, especially when it comes to an appearance-based careers like modelling, but Chinese women feel it more acutely than most. While it may seem absurd to say that Yi Lin is raging against the dying light of her career, it&#039;s also fair to say that strong stigmas still exist in Chinese society for women like her, who have reached a certain age without getting married and settling down with kids. And as one of a vast number of career-focused, unmarried women in her generation, Yi Lin is certainly not going gently into that good night. Her story is one of defiance: defiance against an industry&#039;s bias for youth, and defiance against a traditional society&#039;s expectations for women.<br />
<br />
But it&#039;s also a story of defiance against something else.<br />
<br />
The other topic &quot;A Little Fashion Show&quot; deals with is of family and parenting. And if the first topic I mentioned didn&#039;t resonate with me personally, this one certainly does. Yi Lin lives with her younger sister as their parents had passed away. Tradition dictates that Yi Lin, as the eldest one, should play parent to her younger sibling and take good care of her. And Yi Lin tries to do exactly that. To a fault. During a heated argument between the two sisters, Yi Lin busts out the what is possibly the most memorable line in the whole anthology: &quot;Who do you think I&#039;m doing this for?&quot; This line, along with its classic variant &quot;I&#039;m doing this for your own good&quot; are immortal conversation enders weaponised by Chinese parents against their disobedient children, so I&#039;m sure it triggered a familiar, visceral reaction in many others as it did in me. <br />
<br />
Family and Confucian values underpin Chinese society, and children are always expected to be obedient to the parents who pour their souls into raising them, because parents always know best. Of course, that&#039;s not always true, and even when it is, sometimes children need to be allowed to make their own mistakes. The tragedy is that while many of us grew up knowing that, when we become parents ourselves, we often end up acting just like our own parents. In acting as a parent towards her sister, Yi Lin ends up making the same mistake as a typical Chinese parent: she does not realise her sister has grown up, and does not respect her rights to forge her own path in the world.<br />
<br />
Ultimately though, &quot;A Little Fashion Show&quot; doesn&#039;t explore the theme of rebellion against suffocating parents too deeply. However, this rebellious spirit roars into life in the third and final story, &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot;. <br />
<br />
Better directed, better animated and better written, &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot; is in a different league to the other two stories. Like the headline act of a gig, it finally steps up after the supporting acts have warmed up the crowd. While Shinkai&#039;s influences are rooted in all three stories, they go especially deeply in &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot;, all way down to the communication gimmick used as the central lynch-pin of the story. &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot; features the budding romance between the protagonist Li Mo and his classmate Xiao Yu, and its development across multiple snapshots in their lives. <br />
<br />
The craftsmanship of the story is impressive, managing to spin an intriguing little mystery around everyday settings. Deliberately paced and carefully plotted, &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot; also delivers at its zenith a perfectly weighted emotional punch. For those reasons, a lot of viewers should find this enjoyable, and certainly more accessible in comparison to the other stories. Nevertheless, I expect those who grew up in China to feel a deeper connection. One reason is the familiarity of seeing overly demanding parents putting academic achievement ahead of everything else. Several scenes depict the literal heavy-handedness of Chinese parenting, and the lack of fuss over them - while may seem shocking or unbelievable to some - is exactly what makes the depiction feel genuine: it really isn&#039;t too far outside the norm. <br />
<br />
Straining against the kind of parenting symptomatic of a culture that emphasises strict social order is the burning teenage spirit of rebellion, and it spearheads this last love letter to seishun. &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot; celebrates seishun in all its glory: its inherent ephemeral beauty as well as the emotional baggage; it embraces the flaws of that time in our lives: our hotheadedness, our prideful stubbornness, our naivety, but also acknowledges the purity, the idealistic dreams and fiery determination not yet dampened by the cynicism of experience; and it accepts all of that as part of growing up. <br />
<br />
Like the other stories, a lot goes on beneath the surface of &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot;. The spliced timelines exhibit the pace of change in Shanghai over a decade: some shots of the same scenery highlighting the rapid erection of high rises in the city, others of old town areas underlining the rate at which the old buildings gave way to the new. While I did not grow up in Shanghai, the scruffy outward and interior appearances of the buildings felt exceedingly familiar as the same scenes and changes played out in other cities across the country. Despite all the progress, run-down areas still exist in the latest timeline (and even now at the time of writing), their presence exposing the shabby underbelly of a developing nation hiding beneath the veneer of a glittering, modern cityscape. The regeneration of housing is a contentious topic, and one the anime also touches upon, with the sprinkles of dialogue hinting at the tension between the government&#039;s desire to modernise and the needs of people - particularly the older generation - to hold on to something achingly familiar. A brief scene of a TV showing the 2002 football World Cup gives a nod to the first - and so far only - appearance of Chinese men&#039;s team in the finals. Despite being only a couple of seconds long and lacking any related dialogue, the inconspicuous shot subtly marks the landmark event as a source of pride. The amount of information and feelings that &quot;Love in Shanghai&quot; manages to convey through minute details in animation, dialogue and story is simply astonishing.<br />
<br />
After watching &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot;, I was tempted to make a quip about how, despite being an anime heavily inspired by Shinkai, it affected me more deeply than any of Shinkai&#039;s works. But that&#039;s not really a fair comparison: Shinkai&#039;s anime aren&#039;t tailored to someone with my experiences, whereas this anime is. For example, while I may have understood on an intellectual level how &quot;Your Name.&quot; connects with a people constantly battling natural disasters like the Japanese, as an outsider I can&#039;t really *feel* it. So it&#039;s worth noting the important meta-lesson that &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot; serves up: that our reaction to a piece of art isn&#039;t just down to the art itself, but its intersection with our identity and the lives that we have lived.<br />
<br />
So for me at least, &quot;Flavours of Youth&quot; is a great anime.<br />
<br />
Personal rating: +2.0 (great)<br />

    This is going to be my first review! (LIGHT SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
This movie is an anthology that is composed of 3 stories. I&#039;ll briefly comment about it one by one. <br />
&quot;A Sunny Breakfast&quot; 6/10 <br />
it comes off as an introduction story of an adult lingering the remnants of youth. The story doesn&#039;t really progress instead it comes off poetic and nostalgic. But that&#039;s just it. <br />
&quot;A Little fashion show&quot;. 8/10<br />
A story about two sisters with different careers that separates them from living a kind of lifestyle yet they share the same roof. It&#039;s pretty decent to look at it as a whole but somehow it lacked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285538">
        something. It&#039;s still predictable as it is but what brought significance to the 2nd story is that they managed to breakthrough and intermingle their different passionate careers, showing the good side of sisterhood while approaching adulthood<br />
&quot;Love In Shanghai&quot; 9/10 <br />
To be honest, the last part made me cry. It&#039;s well invested with emotional flares with full of mishaps that breaks the bond between two supposed-to-be lovers. It&#039; starts slow then gradually gives an aching slow burning experience. Cliche as it may sound. The whole execution of the events caught my attention and I felt like that I wanted it to be separate from the anthology because it deserves a movie itself. It can be as good as Garden of Words or nearly good as Your Name. <br />
Overall. It&#039;s very decent. The stories are well narrated. The score is deserving enough since it really followed the movie&#039;s theme.—the different viewpoints of adults looking back at their tracks from their youth—ranging from familial love, love for career and the love from someone.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
As expected, it was from the studio Haoliners and ComixWaves (The one that animated Your name, Garden of Words, 5 centimeters per second etc). I&#039;m never disappointed by their past works so does now. From the city landscapes to the delicate food animation, the color schemes and the tame character designs. The art just gave the movie the realistic vibes. That way, I felt  more resonated and connected while watching it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The sound is very varying from each stories. It was all distinct yet somehow forgettable. But the best part is that the orchestration is so good, it managed to weave out my emotions while the protags narrates their story. And also, for me, the sound always worked with the art/animation in tango. They are always intertwined. And in this movie, they gave us a full-scale combo for a beautiful, radiant and emotional anthology.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
The protagonists in every story did their roles properly in every story. Their personalities made them appear more natural and realistic. But somehow, they still lacked a little bit of substance. But I can&#039;t really blame the short amount of time. It&#039;s hard to read a character when they appear just 30mins or less and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8 <br />
Even though some parts felt boring, the narrative is very good altogether with sound and animation that it kept me relaxed and watch patiently until it ends. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
It&#039;s a must watch!! Don&#039;t watch with full of expectations so you could enjoy and appreciate it fully. It&#039;s not very twisty like Your Name. Watch it alone in a calm environment with a nice cup of tea. This is a grounded movie anthology with full of bittersweet yet radiant stories of nostalgic youth!

    • SLIGHT SPOILER REVIEW •<br />
<br />
Shikioriori, English name: Flavors of Youth, is divided into 3 Chapters: First (Sunny Breakfast), Second (Small Fashion Show), Third (Shanghai Love). Similar on what Shinkai did on 5 Centimeters per Second. The movie is placed in China and even the main character’s name is all in Chinese. But the studio and voice actors are Japanese. Here’s my quick review of the film:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
As the film begins, you&#039;re greeted with an aesthetically beautiful art and animation followed by a few words and the first chapter’s title. The MC of the first chapter then is introduced. As the first chapter ends, the second chapter

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285548">
        begins. The transition is the same as the first one. As the story flows, the movie gives a very heartwarming slice of life, with a slight touch of love, heartbreak, and a mediocre drama. The story travels from the perspective of a young man experiencing youth, first love, and being unknowledgeable about adults. Being able to wonder why do people leave? The story then jumps from a young man to a 20-ish women. The movie shows how life has plenty of trials to overcome, and how people be able to overcome those difficult trials. In this chapter, the movie also questions you, ”The job you choose, are you really enjoying it?” ”Have you really live life to the fullest?”. Then from 20-ish women to a young boy, in this chapter, you are able to realize how communication is really important at any times. This chapter is so far the best among them. A really strong friendship of a group of best friends followed by a trial they should, with the emotion of love, anxiety, and fear at their backs. This chapter shows how this group of friends reacts to their current situation and how time could never be rewind even you wish to. Overall, the plot is filled with tons of great slice of life, paced on a slow start and an explosive ending. There are no big expectations, to begin with. The story might be boring to some non slice of anime fans. 7/10<br />
<br />
Art: As the Studio who created Your Name, 5 Centimeter Per Seconds and Garden of Words, it was amazing. Tho there are times where you can able to see some lousy animation, but overall its good. The budget might not be too big as compared to Shinkai’s work, but CoMix Wave really give a shot especially to those beautiful backgrounds! The CGI of the cars are actually good too. Nevertheless, the animation is amazing, tho they have flaws, but the positives overpowered all the negatives. 8/10<br />
<br />
Sound: Sound effects are great. The food preparation during the first few minutes of the film is amazing. The chopping of ingredients, up to the sound of rain. It&#039;s actually pretty decent. The credits song is actually good too. 8/10<br />
<br />
Character: The character designs are mediocre for me. I mean, CoMix Wave actually has pretty decent animation and art skills. But their character design is just .... meh. Its nothing to be amazing and shock about. VAs are good. They did choose a very warm tone for the VAs of the MCs. There is really no character development that can be seen in the movie. But on how the MCs end their chapter is really a big thumbs up for me. It also relays a message to the viewers and few life lessons. Overall, 7/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I’m a fan of slice of life anime, so I’m pretty used to a slow-paced plot. A slow pace movie also gives the audience time to enjoy the great art drawn by the studio. Afterall, it is a great animation that leads the viewers to finish the movie at the end. I somewhat enjoy the movie. There are no explosives and huge plot twist like Your Name, nor a heavy drama and heart pounding ending like 5 centimeters. Just pure slice of life with a glimpse of love and a tiny drama. Overall, 8/10<br />
<br />
Conclusion: As I said a moment ago, this movie is pace differently to other famous one. So you should not compare it to them as they are way different from each other. I would definitely recommend this anime to SOME, as non slice of life and drama fan might get really bored to this film. Overall, a great film if you are looking for something to cry one. Overall, films score is 8/10.

    As I was sitting down and scrolling through kissanime new anime additions something caught my eye, like a a really pretty bowl of noodles in a fish shop. That would obviously be this movie. Obviously. <br />
<br />
Throughout watching the first part of the movie there was a lot of thoughts swirling in my mind. Why is there only narration? Why does this sink look better then the entire movie? Why aren&#039;t there more noodles? To many questions were going through my mind. One minute the dude is eating noodles and looking at this pretty girl next second were at his grandma&#039;s death bed and I&#039;m like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285592">
        tf is going on, but it was fine, cause next thing I knew there were noodles on the screen again so it was all good. <br />
<br />
Next we have the worst part of the movie. The Not Noodles but Fashion Show part of the movie. If there could be a more predictable story then this I wouldn&#039;t believe you.  Now having things be predictable is fine to an extent. As long as the pacing is good, it&#039;s enjoyable, and there noodles for all to share. News flash it didn&#039;t have any of it. Twas just a bunch of forced and random drama that really didn&#039;t even need to happen and would of been better without it. If only she wore a noodle dress would she have not lost her shady boyfriend. At least I think that&#039;s what he was, i don&#039;t know they never really explained what he was. <br />
<br />
The third one actually not that bad to an extent, it was actually really interesting and if done right, was the only part of the movie, and had more noodles this movie would of been an easy 8 or higher. Honestly just watch the third part and the first part. <br />
<br />
PS: My enjoyment is a 9 cause I watched this on rabb.it with friends so it was more bearable that way.

    The 3 parts covered in Shikioriori are the about the 3 basic needs of human life.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s my first review. Excuse me if it&#039;s not structured properly. <br />
<br />
Spoilers Ahead!<br />
<br />
1. Food<br />
&quot;Hidamari no Choushoku&quot; (Sunny Breakfast)<br />
It took us through the need for food. The magical taste of San Xian noodles. How the loss/change of the taste would make us feel, the people with whom we eat and the atmosphere of where we eat. <br />
<br />
2. Clothing<br />
&quot;Chiisana Fashion Show&quot; (A Small Fashion Show)<br />
It shows how fashion has changed the Clothing industry in a good/bad way (depends how you see it). And the people/models who work in this industry are working

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287382">
        so hard to be at the top. Finally, it shows that just a normal type of clothing of your favourite colour made by your sister would make you feel better than a super-costly dress.<br />
<br />
3. Shelter <br />
&quot;Shanghai Koi&quot; (Shanghai Love)<br />
It shows that the main character is interested in Architecture. Also, the area where he grew up will soon be demolished and renovated as it is kind of old currently and is in the middle of a great city. It also covers other important needs of life like Love, Education, and you know Life itself.<br />
<br />
Post credits scene:<br />
Its kind of a happy scene where we see all these characters of individual stories at the same place very near to each other. And it shows how small and simple the world is but we just don&#039;t notice it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s really great to create an anime of such quality with such basic needs in life. I&#039;m glad to notice this without reading the description of the Anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen people comparing Shikioriori with Kimi no na wa and review Shikioriori as a bad anime that just copied the style. That&#039;s completely absurd. Both the anime are unique in their own style. And yes, the art looks like Kimi no na wa and its good. Because anyone would love to see an art with such great detail and quality. And that&#039;s one big factor we all watch anime.

    Netflix refuses to stop with their nu-animu. This time we have the privilege of experiencing the walk of our lifetime, offered by the Chinese because why should anime be Japan exclusive.<br />
<br />
This movie is split in 3 section that all are about walking,<br />
<br />
1) The first one is really poetic. Walk and talk because why would person just want to simply enjoy scenery and relax. No, being treated like some plebeian tourist is much more rewarding. I personally recommend turning off the sound to avoid this thing from ruining the visuals as well. This in case you, for some weird reason, still decide to watch this anime<br />
<br />
2)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285556">
        The second one is a fashion show walk the catwalk which was pretty philosophical because apparently old people can also walk, but future generations walk faster. This is pretty interesting as I didn&#039;t know anyone would ever in the history of never make a story about such nonsense. <br />
<br />
3) The third one is some sorta 5 centimeters per second alternative which is the best of the 3, but still feels way more pointless than any of the above because the original 5cmps anime (and especially the manga) still exist + it isn&#039;t filled with some Chinese words no one cares about. <br />
<br />
There are also characters in this anime, but I am not sure why anyone would care about them or what they do. In all honesty, I would have found this thing more interesting if the characters had been invisible because at leas then, I could have called it deep for visually representing their personalities. <br />
<br />
The art is kind of interesting, but what art isn&#039;t in this day and age really. As a conclusion: only watch this if you have 2 monitors and are rewatching Hunter x Hunter 2011 at the same time from another. Or at least that&#039;s what I did and it was still a waste of time.

    --- &gt; *Minor spoilers* &lt;--- <br />
<br />
First story was just about a guy smacking on some bomb noodles and that was pretty cool. The animation when they were whipping it up in the kitchen was kinda heat ngl. I personally found this pretty average. The animation was nice and all but the story wasn&#039;t that interesting, it&#039;s just about a guy that likes grubbing on some noodles. 6/10<br />
<br />
The second story was about 2 sisters, one of them worked as a model and the other worked as a designer for her model sister. This story was like eh bruh like I lowkey could&#039;ve just skipped it and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349038">
        wouldn&#039;t care at all. This story might hit the spot for some viewers but it wasn&#039;t for me. The story wasn&#039;t bad just wasn&#039;t interesting enough for me. 4/10<br />
<br />
Now the third story, bruh that was like mad heat ong no cap. The third story revolves around 3 childhood friends that were really close together. 2 males and 1 female. One of them had glasses and the other was irrelevant. So the girl and the guy with glasses liked each other and that was pretty poggers. But then, my boy started trolling and throwing away his chances with this girl. We then see him living his life in the future while we slowly learn about the past and the events that had lead to where he is now. At the end it doesn&#039;t really explain how he got there and how the girl magically found him again after all those years but it was lit. I wish I was able to see more development between those 2 but it&#039;s aight. 8/10<br />
<br />
So now we moving onto the music. They were BANGERS no other way to describe it. Every time an emotional scene happened, the music came creeping in and before you realized it you were BOPPIN to the song. Anyways I highly suggest listening to the ost on your own free time. 9/10<br />
<br />
The visuals were aight as well. They put a lot of their effort into the noodles and cooking but after that it felt a little off and kinda weird. (just my personal opinion) but it wasn&#039;t bad by any means just felt like it went downwards after they went ham on the noodle animations. 6.8/10

    Move along, I’m Chinese, this show is targeted at me and I’m telling you, it’s shite, other Chinese people think so too. End of review.<br />
<br />
Okay.<br />
<br />
This review took a yearlong because I struggled to finish the film when it first came out, here I am a year later, finished it, felt compelled to write a review because it was bad bad.<br />
<br />
First of all, the Netflix version and the Bilibili version is not the same, not only the voice actors are different, the music is different. The Netflix Chinese dub was absolutely awful, the writing was extremely inarticulate, almost seems like it was written and read by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330944">
        a 7-year-old. Even the English dub sounded way better, heck the Brazilian Portuguese was good too and I don’t even understand it. Netflix didn’t even bother dubbing the second story in Cantonese or the dialects in the third story.<br />
<br />
Second, after switching to the ‘original’ version, it’s still shit! What the fuck!! Like the voice acting is slightly better, but it’s still terrible! The second story was set in Guangzhou, so the characters spoke Cantonese, but it wasn’t done very well not because the Cantonese was inaccurate, but the voice actors just read lines with no emotions put in. The dialogues across the whole film sounds like as if I wrote it (and I have Chinese writing skills of a 5-year-old).<br />
<br />
I have very fond connections and memories with the three cities in the film and was excited to see a film around them. The name of the film could also be translated as &quot;four types of youth”, the three types are the ones in the film and the final type is supposed to be your story, you’re meant to self-insert your youth to make up for the fourth type. Poetic sounding right? Except, the other three types of youth story are a bit lame, even my pathetic youth have better dialogues. The first story may as well be “noodle noodle, noodle noodle noodle noodle, noodle.” Second story is shallow and unlikable. Third story is rich pretentious dude reminisce missed youth except he didn’t miss it because he’s rich.<br />
<br />
This type of short story telling really challenges the writer to be concise and deliver an impactful story in significantly less time. In a traditional film you may get an hour or two to build up characters and plot whereas here there’s only 20 minutes to tell one story. If I was the writer, I would really contemplate the purpose and message that you want to deliver to the audience. Quite frankly, I failed to see a good meaning (I didn’t say deep because not everything needs a deep meaning, but it needs at least a good meaning) in the three stories. The first two was just boring and the characters serve no purpose, the third one is slightly better but then I got frustrated because the guy indirectly got the girl lying on the hospital bed, then at the end he got rich because his old house got knock down and the girl came back, what kind of pretentious Mary Sue is that, it would have been more emotional if she never came back, it could have delivered a ‘sometimes we pass by things that were important to us’ kind of message. For once, a sad ending might have made it a better story. After the credits, it forcefully put the characters in the three stories together, what was the point of that??<br />
<br />
However, there is one good thing about the film and that is the still background scenes, it’s got that Shinkai look to it, that’s it, nothing more because the character designs were bad.<br />
<br />
TLDR: bad story, bad characters, don’t bother watching. It might actually be worse than Uchiage, is that even possible.<br />

    Beautiful animation, though not quite on the same levels as they have produced in other films. The problem comes with the stories, firstly because of the short run time and the choice of making 3 short films rather than 1 long or 2 semi-short. This makes it so that there never really is that much time to delve deeper into the characters in each one, so they feel kind of distant and not as relatable as they could be. <br />
There is also an issue with how the films build up their climax and end game, because there is no build up. They introduce the characters,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338046">
        drop a bomb and then leave the empty characters to try to clean up the mess. Not an ideal scenario if you want to make touching stories.<br />
The last story was by far the best, but even then the progression was as clear as a guess 1 sec into the future, especially if you have seen Makoto&#039;s films before this. <br />
Take Your name., which the marketing was based upon, as an example: <br />
* Remove 90% of the film by condensing the beginning of the film to 5 min, take 10 from the middle and squash it together and then take the last 10 min and cut it into 5 min.<br />
* Cut it together so it sort of makes sense.<br />
* Wholá, a finished short film! Yeah, &quot;great&quot;.

    To begin, this anime was premiered at AnimeExpo 2018 if this is in fact what I think it is, so despite the fact that I haven’t been able to add it to my watched list, this is a review for a show that was shown long before MAL said it first aired (and I’m still slightly upset that MAL wouldn’t let me say I completed it, but that’s not your problem)<br />
<br />
While I normally review in the same boring style based on the categories of story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, and overall as per MAL recommendation, Shikioriori/flavors of youth (FoY; sorry but I will be abbreviating

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285521">
        it to this for simplicity) follows 3 different stories, each about as long as a normal 25 minute episode. It will be tough, but try to follow my thoughts because I will be trying to review all 3 stories at the same time to make it easier to discuss each part. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
Split into 3 parts, each has a different message about different parts of life. While it’s not a big issue, it didn’t seem as though there was any sort of connection between any of the 3 stories other than that they all were dealing with their own problems and drama. <br />
<br />
The 1st story (6/10)<br />
is about a kid who has very strong ties to his grandmother and to eating some kind of noodles or beef udon or something if I remember correctly. Either way, it had to deal with eating food and how he establishes connections and meaning in his life through eating this food throughout life as he grows up. By no means is this story bad, but it is incredibly boring. It seems kind of like it was going for a Sweetness and Lightning or Isekai Shokudou, attempting the homey vibe of food, but it didn’t have the same emotional buildup that resonated with me during those shows (particularly the former). It also felt iyashikei style, but as a full movie and only 1 part, it doesn’t work particularly well the way I can imagine Non Non biyori’s movie working, supplemented by cute and already acquainted characters and good comedy. Overall, it’s not bad for completion if you plan to watch it through, but not particularly amazing or interesting. <br />
<br />
The Second Story (4/10)<br />
Is about 2 sisters who I guess used to be pretty close, but have drifted apart over time by the look of the show. The older sister is a model and supports the younger one after some kind of family circumstances occur, while the younger sister falls into the cliche “I just want to support my sister” role. The model is getting older and outshined by younger stars, causing the dramatic internal struggle. What made this part so hard to watch was that the drama wasn’t all that great or emotionally investing and the characters weren’t likable enough to care about their drama. The whole story felt contrived. Somehow, the worst part about it is that it’s hard to skip because it’s right in the middle, but honestly it’s not worth watching. <br />
<br />
The Third Story (9/10)<br />
If you stayed this long through the boring and hard to watch stories, CoMix Wave treats you to a brilliant story that makes you wonder if they could all be this good if Shinkai took over all of them. As it stands, this studio is batting a .333 right now, failing with the first 2 but stunning with this one. Of course, people who endlessly complain about too much school anime won’t ever understand, but this part is about a man who is moving into a new apartment. When he is unpacking, certain things remind him of the past and we are shown flashbacks. It follows a group of 3 kids, he and his 2 best friends, when they were little. One friend is a rambunctious boy while the other is a clearly “embodiment of perfection” girl. With the gimmick of he and the girl exchanging cassette tapes, this is pretty straight as a teen school romance, but it is really well directed by contrast to the other 2 parts. For the first time, there is actual character growth, but more than that is that i managed to feel deeply emotionally connected to the characters and cared about their relationship. I know I didn’t explain it very well, but I highly recommend this specific part. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
A universal strong point is always the art. Animated by Studio CoMix Wave (Normally the Shinkai studio) the art is consistently great, even based on my hazy memory and with poor seating at Anime Expo. Expect every part to have beautiful backgrounds with strong visuals. In particular:<br />
<br />
The first story had extremely detailed food. Which is an important aspect of a story about food. It didn’t mean that the story was any deeper, but they made it look tastier but just as realistic as my instant noodles. <br />
<br />
The second story still had strong visuals; it meant nothing but outfits and characters looked good I guess. <br />
<br />
The third story somehow made me wonder who on their staff still owned a cassette tape to model, but somehow it was very realistic. This part had particularly good backgrounds which contributed greatly to immersion into the story’s town and giving me an idea of the kind of people of the town. <br />
<br />
Sound: (8/10)<br />
It was fine. Nothing seemed wrong, and if it was I probably blamed the poor sound quality of Anime Expo and the downside of not having speakers for all people in the room. I know I can’t say anything bad about it at least. <br />
<br />
Character: (6/10)<br />
It should not be surprising that my assessment of the characters line up with my assessment of the story. As a very straight dramatic film, the characters are far and away the most important aspect to creating the atmosphere of the story. All my sentiments line up exactly the same, with the first story’s MC being boring, the second story’s being almost unbearable to watch, and the third’s being super strong and making me care about their struggles, and end up rooting for them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (7/10)<br />
I found myself well entertained and if watching the first 2 parts ranged from bad to boring, i still wouldn’t be upset watching them if it meant getting to something as good as the 3rd part. <br />
<br />
Overall: (7/10)<br />
All 3 had the universally important art and sound done well, and I felt as if the good part was multiple times better than the bad parts sucked, but not enough to overlook the fact that 2/3 of the anime was either boring or bad. <br />
<br />
Take the time to develop your own opinions about these characters; I just wrote to release pent up frustration with MAL for not allowing me to mark as watched for a full month. <br />

    Although Flavors of Youth might not have the same western appeal as the studios&#039; other works, it is still a film worth experiencing with fantastic visuals, effective music and stories that are short yet sweet. Some might find this movie to be &#039;boring&#039; as the concepts on paper are quite simple and not particularly interesting, however the artistic way that these stories are told makes them surprisingly engaging and really shows the talent of the studio behind this movie.<br />
<br />
It might not be for everyone, however I can safely say I really enjoyed my time with this film and recommend people to give it a chance.

    There are three parts, and all three fail to teach anything about Chinese culture at all. All three parts are generic to watch, though it does get better as it goes on. I particularly like that the first part is dedicated to past, the second to present and the third to the future. It is a nice touch. Though the story-telling was not executed very well.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
1) &#039;A Sunny Breakfast&#039;<br />
You may as well just skip this part. There is nothing to it at all. The entire thing is a guy narrating about noodles. I honestly thought it would end up being a really long noodle

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330495">
        advert. The pacing was awful, one moment he is a child who loves noodles and then he is a teenager who loves noodles. The only character traits of this guy is that he likes noodles and he likes a random girl he sees for about 5 seconds everyday.<br />
<br />
No way is he interesting enough to be called a protagonist. He just talks about how the world is changing and how noodles are getting less and less care put into them. Nothing is actually developed on so there is no way I can be emotionally attached even in the slightest. Some people also die as a quick attempt to get some emotion as if it expects us to care about a random person we do not know. It fails to teach the audience anything about China&#039;s culture, and this is the most Chinese-related part of the whole film. At least this part is actually related to China though in some sense.<br />
<br />
2) &#039;A Small Fashion Show&#039;<br />
This part was a lot better, more of an interesting story with more interesting characters with actual personalities, albeit not very good ones. I didn&#039;t hate it but it also wasn&#039;t something amazing. It also sends out a very bad message to people. It is about this model who is trying to come to terms with the fact that she is getting old, and proceeds to overexert herself through exercise and bulimia in order to try and stay pretty. What a great message to send to the audience. She completely contradicts herself throughout. Who thought this would be a good plot?<br />
<br />
There is very forced drama between her and her sister for reasons I do not understand. When it was happening I really could not figure out why or what was happening. This entire part has absolutely zilch to do with China, and could have taken place literally anywhere in the world. Felt more like an American-based plot in fact.<br />
<br />
3) &#039;Love in Shanghai&#039;<br />
I actually really enjoyed this part, definitely the strongest of them all, and has raised my score a lot. If this had been the only part, then I would give this show an 7/10. Nothing felt forced, and though it was a predictable plot, I still really liked it as it was done right. This guy is in love with this girl, to which they get separated due to his stubborness. Basically it is the plot of Byousoku 5 Centimeter, but arguably better. Though the ending of it made the entire plot kind of pointless, it is still worth watching and the best part of the entire movie.<br />
<br />
Again, doesn&#039;t really have that much to do with Chinese culture, apart from the fact that is has a very Chinese structured family when it comes to school etc. However, like the second part, this could be placed anywhere in the world and still work the same.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Very nice. The background art was very pretty and I cannot fault it too much. The detailing on the backgrounds and the dreaded noodles were very very amazing and aesthetic. Actual character designs were pretty awful and bland, the best of them all would be the second part. The animation itself was choppy and poorly done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Not a lot to say about this. The music was pretty nice, the seiyuus performed their role nicely. There was no OP but the ED song was also quite good. Nothing was really outstanding enough to make this any higher.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
There is nothing great about the characters. The first part had the most unrelatable and monotone protagonist I could ever dream of. Second part had a girl that is extremely unlikable and predictable. Third part had characters that looked as if they were literally stolen from Makoto Shinkai&#039;s works, but they were a lot more likable than the others. I liked the personalities, despite them being very unoriginal.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
I would not recommend this to people, and I will not be watching it again. I think possibly I may have missed the point of this entire movie but to me, it was pretty bad. Especially &#039;A Sunny Breakfast&#039;, skip that part. If it wasn&#039;t for that, then I could have scored a little higher. At least the other parts are actually interesting to watch. Me and my sister were basically falling asleep with that first part.

    [Spoiler Free Review] <br />
<br />
I am someone who was born and raised in the country of Iceland so I&#039;ve never really properly experienced urban life for long period of times, yet even though these stories take place in china, the reminisced quite well with me and my old cold heart.<br />
<br />
The Movie Follows the sweet young love stories of three characters from different areas and in different cities of china. I&#039;ve always been a big fan of china and its rich juicy history, and have even considered moving there if it was not for its urban pollution problems and messed politics. <br />
Its obviously directed towards the Chinese

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312708">
        audience and each short story manages to sneakingly capture some underlying problems in Chinese society while giving the average viewer a treat for their heart.<br />
As someone who has managed to fuck up a relationship with the person i cherish the most i can only tell the younger viewers reading this should to try and enjoy the simple pleasures of life rather then rush ahead like i did, wasting a huge part of my youth.<br />
<br />
Each and every story was filled with heartwarming pleasures that warm the soul and something ill probably come and re-watch again and again until I&#039;ve milked it as much as i can.<br />
<br />
The art was pretty great and definitely deserves a 9 but due to the fact i love bright anime styles it gets a +1 point from me.<br />
<br />
The sound was great and each and every detail had a sound that made everything feel real and comforting.<br />
<br />
The Characters are one of the best aspects of these shorts and seeing them reminisce and fix their mistakes or aspire to get what they wanted was a great experience.<br />
<br />
I Personally Did not like &quot;Your name&quot; at all and i came into this expecting nothing special but man was i wrong. This is a great piece of anime art and something i recommend to most who have the time on their hands.<br />
<br />
As by my review tradition, The best thing you can have while watching this is a cup of instant noodles while you sit in a soft sofa/chair.<br />
<br />
Overall (9)<br />

    Flavours of Youth is a story not dedicated to literal food. Rather, a collection of three stories from a time of the early tastes of life. The taste of nostalgia if you like.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say I relate to this movie, my life isn&#039;t very exciting or eventful compared to others. What I will say however is that it is a good representation of the many different stories people carry along with them and continue to write days, months, years into the future, until the halting of one&#039;s life comes. Picture yourself in a busy metropolitan area, with every person that passes you, a story, eventful,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367741">
        uneventful, exciting, unexciting, happy, unhappy, orthodox, unorthodox, interesting, uninteresting. A magnitude of adjectives can be used to describe an individual&#039;s sole story, and it is mind-boggling really. It probably isn&#039;t something you think about on a daily basis, but we forget that every person you pass by has this story that may or may not be worth your time, but an interesting timeline of events to share nonetheless. Flavours of Youth is just that reminder about this concept which makes it more interesting to watch, as I have said. You may get not out of the anime, or you might get one of the best anime you have seen in a while. But the fact reminds that it gives this idea of invisible crossroads with pretty much every human that you have seen in your life. It is a lovely representation of the connectivity of all of us.<br />
<br />
When I watched this, I personally enjoyed the parts in the order of (highest to lowest): 1, 3, 2. The 1st story - The Rice Noodles, just shows the nostalgia of the literal taste that comes with nostalgia, and what was being experienced at the time. It had pretty good narration which would make sense with flashbacking, personally why I enjoyed it a lot. The 2nd story - A Little Fashion Show, probably the most different of all three, revolve around fashion. The clever thing about the 2nd part was not the flashbacking to the past but rather, the little sister acting as a memoir for the past. The 3rd story - Love in Shanghai, is basically every drama romance you have seen, in saying that though, it is a good thing that it exists to show the &quot;regular&quot; lives that go on in this world. Basically, all three stories do pretty well in showing the norm and not the norm, connecting them at the very end to give an image of the connections we all have. It is done simplistically but it is to be expected from people who aren&#039;t exactly flying through the air at will, or have been isekai&#039;d for the 36th time already. But don&#039;t be disheartened, the simple is sometimes the most beautiful, and Flavours of Youth is no exception.<br />
<br />
The audiovisuals aren&#039;t exactly the best that CoMix Wave can give if I am honest, probably the worst I have seen from the studio, but that doesn&#039;t mean it is bad, it is just that you will find better. I would still say it is visually appealing and the ost is alright if you need some words that would best fit.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.2 (7)<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR Review:<br />
Story - 7: Three-in-one, all stories have a good connection and theme of the past.<br />
Art - 8: Not the best from CoMix Wave, by no means bad, however.<br />
Sound - 7: Decent ost<br />
Character - 7: Fine characters you would expect to see in stories of its kind<br />
Enjoyment - 7: Worth the time. Can get a thing or two from the story to think on as well.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.2 (7)<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t the longest review I have made, I wanted to keep it more summarized, as well as the story didn&#039;t have a lot to offer than I could comment on. But what I really liked about this anime is that it goes to show that the people around you may be much more interesting than you think on the surface of things. You never know what story may keep you intrigued, and the people next to you are probably your best bet of finding such a thing. Online or in real life. We sometimes forget the best things are usually the closest.<br />

    So Flavors Of Youth is an anime mixed of 3 different stories. So let me explain each of them.<br />
<br />
1st one. So the first story is about a guy named Xiao Ming and his grandmother. The whole story of the anime was about the moment&#039;s of Xiao childhood with his grandmother and some highschool memories of Xiao. <br />
<br />
2nd story. The second story was about two sisters named Yi Lin and Lulu. So Yi Lin is a beautiful model and her little sister is a fashion designer. They both lost their parents in childhood. So they both live in an apartment together. But for some reason, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362912">
        relationship between Yi Lin and her sister Lulu is not that good. One day Yin Lin had to quit her job ( I&#039;m not saying the reason because it would be a spoiler). But Yin&#039;s sister Lulu doesn&#039;t want her sister to quit her job. So that&#039;s why Lulu tried to fill the gap between the relationship with her sister and encourage her to not quit the job.<br />
<br />
And finally the last story. <br />
The last story is one of the best stories of this anime. The last story is about a boy named Li Mo and his youthful days with his two friends Pan and Xiao Yu. So Xiao Yu was Li Mo&#039;s past lover. An exchange of tapes became their language of love and their words of encouragement for each other. But one day Xiao&#039;s father decided to send her daughter to a popular high school far away from her home. So that means she has to leave Li Mo. But Li Mo doesn&#039;t want to leave Xiao. So he studied day and night to get admission to the same school where Xiao going. So, as a result, he started to avoid everyone even his lover Li Mo and studied like crazy. But the fact is that Li also doesn&#039;t want to leave Xiao so she denied her father&#039;s idea. But one the other hand Xiao gets admission to the high school and leave his lover. But before leave Li gave the last tape to Xiao and describes how she feel about him.<br />
<br />
So all three-story was really so enjoyable and the last story was totally heartwarming. I mean the last story was the best story of the whole anime. Overall the soundtracks and the animation were great. If you a big fan of anime like A Silent Voice, Your Name, I Want To Eat Your Pancreas so at last watch the last story of the anime.   <br />

    I&#039;ve read reviews of this movie written by Chinese people who said this spoke to them very deeply. I respect it, because this is coming from a very specific place, but I don&#039;t relate to it for the same reason. I just don&#039;t share the context. Artistically, this is another hyper-detailed anime that mistakes fidelity for quality. It&#039;s completely at odds with my aesthetic preferences.<br />
<br />
The first of the three shorts exist solely so they could get funding to make animated food gifs. But I found the short so unappealing that I&#039;ll probably never look at those gifs (which recycle regularly) the same again. The second

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356458">
        was fine, but not challenging at all. It seemed like they threw it together naratively, because there was no point to the pink-haired girl whatsoever by the end, even though she was nominally an antagonist. The shot of the main girl fainting on the runway was really good, though.<br />
<br />
I liked the third short the best, but it was also somewhat simple. Once they had chosen the hook of using the tape recorder (which I was a sucker for because I like relationships expressed through old tech, let&#039;s be real), that whole story probably fell directly into place. The symbolism of him moving on to a CD player, which is basically read-only, as opposed to the tape recorder&#039;s read-write nature that facilitated his relationship with the girl, was kino af.

    Each story has a beautiful ring to it.<br />
<br />
The first story, depicts the story of the love towards food and shadowing the relationship between a grandmother and grandson behind it. It inspires us on how important it is to appreciate the moment while it lasts.<br />
<br />
The second story, reflects on the relationship between two sisters, how their life influence each other and the beautiful they share, supporting each other despite the fights that they had.<br />
<br />
The third story, has just shown how we all make mistakes and yet the time cannot be rewinded, what is done in the past has already gone. You could only continue your life,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294228">
        make a better tomorrow, either to fix your past mistakes or enjoy the present moment with your loved ones.<br />

Slight note: There&#039;s an end-credit scene. Watch until the very end!

    I wrote a review for this movie, but it seems like it didn&#039;t get saved, cause now it&#039;s gone (maybe I accidentally deleted it). So here&#039;s a VERY summed up review of the anthology movie mostly so I can go back here if I ever forget why I liked the movie<br />
<br />
Short 1: Had good animation but looked very weird sometimes. The story was very plain and so was the main character who didn&#039;t get any development either. The music was okay<br />
<br />
Short 2: Had much better animation, characters, and story, but the music was still just okay<br />
<br />
Short 3: Had a great story, good animation, and okay

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285745">
        characters and music.<br />
<br />
All together: they all had a consistent theme but used it in different ways making it interesting

    Really amazing work! <br />
The stories are about the little things in life and why we should cherish them. They are easy to relate to and did bring back quite a lot of memories from my youth (I&#039;m not even 25, what am I saying, haha). It&#039;s one of those anime that, while nostalgic, evokes a sort of inner piece and brightens your day. I enjoyed it throughout!<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10 - The art really is outstanding! Very colorful and well made<br />
<br />
Animation: 9/10 - While not having many fast-paced scenes, simple ones like making noodles were taken to the next level.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10 - Considering main characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292137">
        had ~25 min screen time, they were quite interesting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 - no question about this!<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
