As if by fate, two students—Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura—stumble upon each other on the second floor of the school gymnasium.

    Shoujo Ai/Yuri is a rather unpopular and controversial genre. Most people I&#039;ve seen are quite indifferent when it comes to Shoujo Ai and often try avoiding it; partly because same sex relationship has always been a sensitive topic, but mostly because of the fact that a lot of Shoujo Ai anime have been very ineffective lately.<br />

I&#039;m not a big fan of Shoujo Ai either. While I&#039;m definitely not against the concept of lesbian relationships being depicted in anime, among the few Shoujo Ai anime I watched, not a single one managed to appeal to me. Rather, because of poor storytelling and especially bland characters, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369650">
        found them mediocre to say the least. Suffice to say, my experience with the Shoujo Ai genre hasn&#039;t been very pleasant.<br />
<br />
Until I found Adachi to Shimamura, that is.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t lie, I was a bit skeptical about watching Adachi to Shimamura at first. Having had a bitter experience with the Shoujo Ai genre in the past, my first impressions of the show weren&#039;t very promising. I thought it was just going to be another typical Shoujo Ai—it didn&#039;t seem like something I would enjoy. I probably couldn&#039;t have been more wrong, though, as I fell in love with the series right from the get-go.<br />
<br />
Adachi to Shimamura, or shortly AdaShima, is built on the relationship of two high school students, namely—you guessed it—Adachi and Shimamura. The story of the anime is told from the perspectives of these two girls, as they spend precious time together trying to figure out what they truly mean to each other. And I have to say, this show does such a beautiful job at portraying their relationship.<br />
<br />
Adachi and Shimamura are introduced as typical buddies who merely hangout with each other during class time. We are given the early impression that they don&#039;t see each other as more than close friends. However, as they spend more time together, they begin to realize that their relationship may not be as simple as they initially thought. When I&#039;m saying &quot;they&quot;, I&#039;m mostly referring to Adachi. I&#039;ll get to that in a bit.<br />
<br />
Adachi and Shimamura are rather unalike, I would say. On one hand, we have Adachi, an unsociable and shy girl who prefers avoiding any social interaction and skips almost all of her classes. On the other hand, we have Shimamura, who also skips classes; but unlike Adachi, she seems sociable and outgoing (which isn&#039;t entirely true). Shimamura, in many ways, is vastly different from Adachi. However, when they are together, their dissimilarities cease to become relevant and don&#039;t matter at all.<br />
<br />
Since AdaShima explores the minds of both Adachi and Shimamura individually, we get insights into their thought-processes and what they genuinely think of each other. Because of this, we are quickly informed of any sort of development in their relationship, even if it might seem minor or insignificant to most. This is one of the many aspects that separate AdaShima from other Shoujo Ai anime, and this is also where Adachi&#039;s excellence really shows.<br />
<br />
Adachi is easily the shining star of the show for me. Don&#039;t get me wrong; I love Shimamura too, but Adachi is truly special. Her prowess as a character probably lies the most in her relatability. Yes, she might be very reserved, timid and unsociable. Yes, she might even be a little clingy, jealous and possessive at times. But knowing her circumstances, pretty much all of it is justifiable. Adachi, just like any other person, wants to make a lot of friends. She wants to talk with them, hangout with them, go to various places with them, and simply have a lot of fun with them. And Shimamura is just the person who can help her do that.<br />
<br />
Insightful explorations into Adachi&#039;s mind is another aspect that makes her such a great character. Through these explorations, the anime lets the viewers know more of Adachi&#039;s thoughts, internal struggles, insecurities—or to put it simply, Adachi herself. This greatly fleshes out her character and makes her a nuanced person. Her monologues about herself and her feelings toward Shimamura are also nothing short of beautiful, and make her even more appealing as a character. Adachi&#039;s seiyuu Akari Kitou&#039;s contribution here is undeniably vital.<br />
<br />
In a way, among the two, Adachi plays a more—for lack of a better word—mature role in the relationship. Despite rejecting her feelings towards Shimamura at first, she gradually learns to accept it. While Shimamura stays kinda oblivious of her feelings for considerably a long time, Adachi becomes aware of her feelings rather quickly and tries her best to advance their relationship, even if she doesn&#039;t always succeed. This explains what I said a few paragraphs ago (about &quot;they&quot; mostly referring to Adachi).<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, though, Shimamura definitely is not a bad character. She is rather one of the most essential parts of what make AdaShima so great. Shimamura seems quite ordinary upon first impression, but it is quickly apparent that there is far more to her than meets the eye. She keeps up an appearance of a normal, friendly and outgoing girl to others. But in reality, she is a very self-aware person who has built an imaginary shell around her that most people, including her &quot;friends&quot;, can&#039;t get through. She always stays cautious of others when she interacts with them, and never really puts much trust and confidence in them, which explains her oblivious nature at times. Again, adeptly dissecting Shimamura&#039;s mind through monologues like Adachi is very helpful in this regard.<br />
<br />
Shimamura&#039;s contribution in Adachi&#039;s development is irrefutable. It&#039;s because of Shimamura that Adachi is starting to change for the better. Like Adachi said, Shimamura is her sun—who makes her everyday life a lot brighter and a lot more exciting. Because of Shimamura, school has turned into something Adachi now looks forward to everyday. Contrary to her past self, she has become a lot livelier and a lot more cheerful. And that truly is a remarkable achievement.<br />
<br />
That isn&#039;t to say Adachi didn&#039;t have any affect on Shimamura at all. In fact, she did. Shimamura may not have realised it right away, but Adachi is one of the few people who has broken through her shell and directly affected her. While some people might say that Shimamura&#039;s change isn&#039;t very apparent, it isn&#039;t negligible by any means. Rather, Adachi&#039;s arrival is a very crucial event in Shimamura&#039;s life, that helped her change herself for the better.<br />
<br />
Some viewers may have complaints about the slow progression of Adachi and Shimamura&#039;s relationship, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an issue at all. It&#039;s true that their relationship progresses at a rather slow pace, but the progression is indeed steady and consistent for the entirety of the series. In most romance anime, this slow progression would get annoying after a while, but here, it&#039;s completely believable if you take their personalities and their circumstances into account (for example, the fact that both of them are girls).<br />
<br />
Another aspect that is worth looking into is how their relationship progresses—or more specifically, what helps their relationship progress. As I said earlier, the romantic advancement in this anime is rather slow paced, but it is purposeful and almost never done in an unrealistic way. A lot of thought and consideration has been put into almost all of their interactions and dialogues to make them meaningful and relatable to the viewers.<br />
<br />
An example of this can be found in episode 4. At the end of the episode, Shimamura buys Adachi a juice can, which Adachi decides to keep to herself instead of throwing it away and cherishes it as a gift from Shimamura. This may seem stupid to others, but I think every person who has ever been in love, irrespective of their sexuality, can relate to this. Yes, it is stupid. But that doesn&#039;t make it wrong or meaningless any way. No matter what others may say, it is in fact meaningful.<br />
<br />
This, again, shows how much care has been given to make Adachi and Shimamura&#039;s relationship genuine and convincing. Even seemingly trivial things are actually impactful on them, but it is almost never unrealistic. As time passes on like it always does, Adachi and Shimamura grow closer to each other as, to simply put, things happen between them. And we, as the viewers, can&#039;t help cheer them on for their ever-budding relationship. At least I couldn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Although the main focus of the series is Adachi and Shimamura, other characters do get a fair amount of screentime. The most notable one of all is, of course, Yashiro Chikama.<br />
<br />
I find Yashiro&#039;s role in the show to be rather bizarre and ambiguous to be honest. Early in the anime, she is seen wearing a full-body spacesuit and introducing herself as an &quot;alien&quot; who has to come to Earth from outer space to look for her compatriot. And even after 12 episodes, that&#039;s basically all we know about her. Though her physical appearance is shown later in the series, her actual identity is never revealed, which makes you doubt the plausibility of her character. Despite this, though, Yashiro is mostly a charming individual. While her antics might come off as weird to a lot of viewers, and there are times when she can be irritating, it&#039;s quite hard to dislike her.<br />
<br />
Aside from Yashiro, Hino and Nagafuji appear regularly in the anime. They are introduced as childhood buddies who are friends with Shimamura since middle school. However, later in the series, it becomes apparent that their relationship may involve romance. While Hino and Nagafuji aren&#039;t nearly as nuanced and developed as Adachi and Shimamura, they are given enough screentime to make the viewers actually care about them. Some might argue that removing these two entirely would have no effect on the story, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s true. Hino and Nagafuji are, in some ways, impactful on the relationship of Adachi and Shimamura, and thus they are impactful on the overall story as well.<br />
<br />
Moving on to other supporting characters, they are all likeable and, more importantly, behave in a consistent and reasonable manner which makes them all believable. Occasionally, they help the story move forward, but it doesn&#039;t feel redundant at all. Adachi&#039;s mother, Shimamura&#039;s sister and mother—everyone plays their role consistently and contributes to the progression of the story when needed. (There is one problem, however, which I&#039;ll bring up again a little later.)<br />
<br />
AdaShima doesn&#039;t fail to impress me in terms of its production quality either. The animation is very beautiful. The artstyle is rather distinct, colorful and vivid, immediately leaving a memorable impression on the viewers&#039; mind. What is more noteworthy, though, is the clever use of visual metaphors and how helpful they are in regard of subtly depicting Adachi and Shimamura&#039;s thoughts and emotions. Though, there are a few fanservice scenes involving some of the characters (specifically bath scenes), which are quite unnecessary and can feel a bit bothersome. But other than that, there isn&#039;t much to complain about.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of AdaShima is easily one of the best this year has had to offer. The background music is mostly upbeat, resembling the rather light-hearted nature of the show. There are a few melancholic tunes as well, that are played during the more serious scenes and add more immersion to them. The opening song &quot;Kimi no Aeta Hi&quot; is quite cheerful, while the ending song &quot;Kimi no Tonari de&quot; has a sort of sombre tone to it. Nonetheless, both of these songs are very remarkable. The voice acting is also impressive. Notably, the seiyuu of Adachi and Shimamura, respectively Akari and Miku, performed extraordinarily well and added more depth to their respective characters through their voice acting.<br />
<br />
Now, although AdaShima is mostly brilliant, there are a few issues....<br />
<br />
The first issue of the anime, as mentioned earlier, stems from the character of Yashiro. While she herself is not a bad character, the ambiguity and vagueness surrounding her might make it difficult to find her presence in the show significant. This can be overlooked in some cases; however, the second problem is rather severe and problematic. It won&#039;t be hard at all to notice that there isn&#039;t a single named male character in the cast, which alone makes the secondary cast kinda weak and vigourless. There are also occasional bath scenes, a few out-of-place plot elements (the fortune teller, for example), and the random appearance of a lolicon in episode 4 which was completely unnecessary and devoid of any logic whatsoever.<br />
<br />
What perhaps will irk the viewers the most, though, is how the show concludes.<br />
<br />
Many people probably won&#039;t be fully satisfied with the ending of AdaShima, as it feels sort of incomplete and leaves you wanting for more. This isn&#039;t inherently a flaw of the story, though, considering the light novel of AdaShima is still being published and a lot of it is yet to be adapted—giving hopes for a second season. But the problem is, the anime industry has a tendency to leave anime adaptations incomplete. Simply, many anime adaptations are never given a second season. Unfortunately, this is even more likely to be the case with AdaShima taking into account that it hasn&#039;t gained much popularity. But still, I will be waiting patiently.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not often that you find a genuinely compelling Shoujo Ai anime, which is why Adachi to Shimamura is truly special. It isn&#039;t free of flaws, and it isn&#039;t the most serious portrayal of same sex relationships, but it&#039;s nonetheless a spectacular anime. Adachi and Shimamura are simply outstanding. They are greatly nuanced and realistic characters that I believe almost anyone can find relatable. Combine this amazing main cast with consistent and likeable supporting characters, well crafted story, alluring artwork and beautiful soundtrack, and you&#039;ve got yourself a marvelous anime.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just a shame that not many Shoujo Ai anime are like this.

    “Before I realized it, Shimamura was surrounded by new people, and things were going well for her but not for me,” Adachi says as she crouches in a dark corner, one episode after thinking about Shimamura naked for a whole hour.<br />
<br />
Adachi to Shimamura has so many flaws that I could go on and on about every single detail that makes this show deserving of a 3/10. I planned to do exactly that when I started writing this review. But as I actually thought about what I wanted to write, I found myself gravitating towards one aspect of the show that truly hindered my enjoyment. While

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369707">
        I believe that the series has many issues, this review will specifically cover Adachi and Shimamura’s relationship in the show, how it is poorly built, and how it reflects toxic infatuation.<br />
<br />
The beginning of the show is rushed, and I don’t feel like I’m getting to know the characters, but somehow, their relationship magically progresses anyway. The story starts off with the two main characters encountering each other in a secluded section of their school gym. They spend their time in that dimly lit area ditching class and playing ping pong. That’s it. Then everything else, including all of the details about their relationship, just falls into place and rushes past the audience at 80 miles per hour. They ditch class and the next thing we know is they’re lying down on each other&#039;s laps and talking about each other&#039;s thighs. Ten minutes into the show, they’re already able to sense each other&#039;s souls. Before their eyes even meet, everything goes in slow-mo, and they know the other person is there. Their relationship literally jumps straight from acknowledgement to a bond so deep it causes clairvoyance. And it’s all just because of the fact that they’re both girls that ditch class. Nothing else ties these two people together.<br />
<br />
The worst part is that while the producers of the show don’t draw out the details of their relationship, they do manage to draw out the fact that they ditch class with melodramatic dialogue. They make ditching class seem so sad and lonely that I’m convinced that the show deliberately does this as a way to make you ship these two girls together. ‘People who ditch class together, belong together’; It’s much easier to simply believe that than to actually do some proper relationship building.<br />
<br />
Even Adachi seems to believe that ditching class means that they’re suddenly BFFs. And this is where the toxic infatuation starts to show.<br />
<br />
To Shimamura, their first encounter was unexpected but fun. She had just found a new friend to hang out with. To Adachi, their encounter gave her life a new meaning. Ditching class was something that Adachi thought only a miserable, friendless kid like her could do. And then came Shimamura who finally understood her feelings of wanting to ditch, and Adachi’s heart burst open.<br />
<br />
But when Adachi realizes that Shimamura isn’t actually sad and lonely, Adachi is very very deeply offended. Adachi is so offended that when she finds out that Shimamura has other friends, she begins a two minute internal dialogue about how she wished Shimamura didn’t have her friends. At the end of the first episode, Adachi even tells Shimamura, “I’m glad you aren’t going home with your other friends.”<br />
<br />
It’s one thing to want to spend time with your crush because you miss them. And it’s a whole other thing to wish that every single person around your crush becomes completely out of the picture. Adachi wants to be alone with Shimamura so much that Adachi couldn’t care less about the fact that Shimamura has other people who care about her. Adachi feels that Shimamura is entitled to her. Adachi thinks that she is the only person that should get Shimamura’s attention. When Shimamura pays any attention to anyone else, it’s an insult to the “relationship they have built.”<br />
<br />
In one episode, Adachi gets jealous of a ten year old girl for sitting next to Shimamura. In Adachi’s eyes, anyone who comes within a 2 meter radius of her crush, no matter the age or situation, automatically becomes a competitor for her love. Adachi is like a possessive partner who tells their girlfriend what to wear. But in this case, Adachi isn’t even dating Shimamura. She just wants to dictate every single person Shimamura talks to, sits next to, and pays attention to. If this is not the definition of toxic, then I don’t know what is.<br />
<br />
But this scene escalates even further. When Shimamura wants to try some of the ten year old’s food, she asks the child to give her some. The child then gives her a spoonful of the meal. There should be nothing wrong with this. The child is just following instructions, and Shimamura is just hungry. But Adachi is losing her mind. Upon seeing Shimamura eat someone else’s food, Adachi is thrown into a state of utter jealousy and insecurity. She pouts her lip and literally squints her eyes at the five year old. Then to fight for Shimamura’s attention, she starts feeding Shimamura too! In one smooth motion, Adachi pulls Shimamura by the shirt, and brings a forkful of spaghetti to Shimamura’s face.<br />
<br />
In another episode, Shimamura is invited by some girls in her class to eat lunch together. When Adachi overhears this, she looks to Shimamura and all but pleads her not to accept. But Shimamura is a normal girl who can make her own choices, and she chooses to accept their invitation. Adachi is devastated by this decision. She is so devastated that upon seeing Shimamura eat lunch with other people, she physically sprints out of the room.<br />
<br />
Adachi cannot stand that fact that Shimamura is an independent person with a life of her own. Shimamura is the center of Adachi’s universe. And Adachi believes that she should be the center of Shimamura’s. It’s expecting, conditional, unrealistic, practically obsessive, and extremely toxic.<br />
<br />
This is not how relationships work. No one is entitled to give you their full attention 24/7. Even people who are actually married don’t do this. If you cannot stand the fact that your crush is an independent person who has other things to focus on and has other people to interact with other than yourself, you should not be looking for a romantic relationship. If you feel like the world is ending because your crush isn’t paying attention to you for a couple of minutes, all you need is a baseball cap, and you’re a less violent Joe Goldberg in the making. My advice to Adachi would probably be to focus on herself first. Adachi needs to find a sense of self security so that when Shimamura looks at, speaks to, or interacts with any other human being in any way, Adachi doesn’t feel like her life has lost all meaning.<br />
<br />
Adachi needs to get a life. Even when Adachi isn’t with Shimamura, she is constantly thinking of her. When she goes to a store, instead of thinking about what she wants to buy for herself, she thinks about what Shimamura might want. Some episodes just start off with Adachi saying Shimamura’s name over and over again. To Adachi, Shimamura is the sun, the earth, the sky, and the air we breathe. Without her all living things die. Adachi loves Shimamura so much that she wants to be the only person next to her. We might as well call the show Shimamura to Shimamura’s over infatuated fangirl.<br />
<br />
From the way the relationship is built to the way that it is portrayed, I find nothing worth praising about Adachi to Shimamura. I don’t know how anyone could find this cute when the main character is too immature and insecure for romance, and every single action in the show is the result of unhealthy obsession and toxicity. All I can say after watching it is that I wish I had watched something else.<br />
<br />

    Humans are social animals, meaning we interact with other humans and experiment how we live with our lives. Adachi no Shimamura’s storytelling feels like a social exploration of two female characters and how their interactions influences each other. Hitoma Iruma’s light novel getting an anime adaptation brings together this unforgettable slice of life, romance tale.<br />
<br />
Everyone in this world has their own story. Regardless of race, gender, social status, or any other factor, each one of us lives in our own story. However, our own story sometimes intersects with others and that’s how relationships are built. Among relationships, one of the most dynamic and complex is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369651">
        romance. Not every romance story begins with a pair of characters falling in love. From the very first episodes, we meet Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura. With a habit of skipping school classes, both girls meet by what seems to be a red line string of fate. On that special day, their story would come together and become one they won’t ever forget.<br />
<br />
At their age, teenagers are the most common form of social animals in society. Adachi and Shimamura exemplifies what it means to be youthful and growing up. They may not have endgame goals in life yet but they have to opportunity to discover their future. Adachi no Shimamura carries a relationship bond that can be simple to understand or complex as you want it to be. Adachi’s encounter with Shimamura isn’t anything out of the ordinary but there’s already something special about them from the very first episode. From there on, the two builds on their relationship beyond the classroom doors as they each discover similarities and differences between each other. <br />
<br />
Indeed, this anime’s roadmap has it settled together with the beginning, middle, and to the end. It would seem that while the anime adaptation handles itself at 12 episodes, it knew what road to follow with its pacing. Every episode throws in a new opportunity in some shape or form for Adachi and Shimamura to bond. It all feels so realistic because these opportunities exist in real life such as going shopping, sharing presents during the holidays, or simply just hanging out together at school. Do you remember your teenage years? It was a time to learn more about just school. It was a time to learn about how to be who you want to be in society. Adachi and Shimamura&#039;s personalities are also amplified whenever they are together. When you see the two interact, it looks like two curious animals playing with each other. This is unusual for the case of Adachi, as she is introduced with a rather reserved personality. On the other hand, Shimamura is somewhat of a scatterbrain with trouble socializing with others. From the first few episodes, you can tell that both characters aren’t exactly classroom leaders or the first person to raise their hand in class for a school play. They keep to themselves and skip classes to avoid social interaction.<br />
<br />
Despite the small cast of characters, the show maintains important relationships between its cast. Outside of our titular characters, there’s also Hino and Nagafuji. With their strong connection, we learn about their commitment as close friends, and perhaps even more. It’s through their bond that carries the intimacy of a relationship. Further down the road, we are introduced to self-proclaimed alien girl Yashiro Chikama, one of the most unusual characters in the show. (don&#039;t worry, she&#039;s not an actual alien). Often wondering around and about, Chikama displays the innocence of a social animal. Unlike most of the main cast, she loves interacting with others and trying to sell her image as an alien. This type of personality represents the opposite of Adachi and Shimamura, who tries to avoid dealing with other social animals. Nonetheless, Chikama’s addition to the show brings in the comedic side of the anime. Let’s face it, if this show is melancholic throughout the entire duration, it could feel stale. And indeed, be prepared for a lot of melancholic moments ranging from the very first episode to the end. Like I said before, it would seem this show had its roadmap planned from the start. It knew where the anime would begin and how it would end.<br />
<br />
Watching this show from start to finish also felt like living in their world with the cast. Adachi and Shimamura are designed with delicacy and feminine charm. This is especially true for Adachi with her icy dark hair while Shimamura has the look of an innocent young woman. On the other hand, Chikama has the unusual look of her skin, almost as if shining as an otherworldly being. Regardless, all the characters are believable humans and it’s not hard to see why. Their character expressions reflect how normal people would interact regardless of their personalities. Furthermore, there’s an elegant degree of tranquility with the visual backgrounds of the show. This applies to scenes with bike riding scenes to the intimate moments we see so often throughout each episode. No, you won’t get to see girls having sex but you will definitely see how curious social animals such as Adachi and Shimamura come together like destiny.<br />
<br />
I’m just going to throw it out here and say that regardless how you feel about lesbian relationships, there’s a chance to learn something about the show altogether. When God gave us brains, we all got free will and can chose to be with we want to be with. In this show, there’s Adachi and Shimamura, a pair of social animals that shows us what it means to be real humans.

    mild spoilers ahead<br />
<br />
Good morning class, today in Linear Anime 101, we will be discussing the anime formula for the perfect GL: Mandatory head on lap scene, skirt shots, &#039;cute&#039; scenes that would be considered cringe and creepy if one of the characters was a guy. Any questions? *multiple hands raised* aLrIgHt nO qUesTiOnS, sO LeT&#039;s gEt sTaRTed.<br />
<br />
Although I haven&#039;t read the LN which the anime is based on, in my opinion, Adachi to Shimamura is a frustratingly horrible adaptation of its manga counterpart. When I read the manga, there weren&#039;t NEARLY as many of these horrendous, borderline ecchi, oversexualized portrayals. While the manga was cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369649">
        and had decent pacing, the story was a bit lackluster. The anime is simply a colorized version of this with the same problems and horrendous amounts of offensive filler. Starting from the first episode, the pacing feels super slow and nothing happens other than the introduction of the MCs, Adachi and Shimamura. Initially, the art was actually good. You can really tell the studio clearly put effort into the drawings, such as how they drew the characters’ eyes in a very sparkly and unique way. It honestly felt like a breath of fresh air. However, the studio’s budget was spent mostly on panty shots and still shots of their legs instead of the actual events in the story. It’s one of those anime where the people who like it will say &quot;I watch for the plot&quot;, when in reality, there is no plot.<br />
<br />
I will admit that there are times where the pacing picks up. But it never makes sense when it does. In the first episode, Adachi and Shimamura meet each other for the first time while ditching class. In a normal romance (and friendship), the next step would be to become deeper friends through exposition and getting to know each other better right? Well the problem is, in the very next episode, we jump past the relationship build up, and Adachi sits in between Shimamura’s legs in a way that is a bit ‘too friendly’. In between the first two episodes, we missed the entire buildup dialogue required for normal people to get to that point. In the span of one day, these two ‘friends’ who, by the way, are not even in a relationship, have reached second base before they’ve exchanged phone numbers. Somehow in just 1 episode, the director managed to get zero development and too much development simultaneously...the only thing that was done differently from the manga is the fact that the anime makes every action as suggestive as possible.<br />
<br />
The story doesn’t get better. ⅓ of it is wasted on side characters who have no relevance in developing our MC’s romantic relationship. Take Yashiro for example, an elementary school girl who is honestly brighter than my future. She is literally the sparkliest thing I&#039;ve ever seen. There was a Christmas tree scene where the lighting of the Christmas tree wasn’t nearly as bright as Yashiro herself. Yeah, that’s how sparkly she is. At first, I didn&#039;t dislike Yashiro. But after watching a love triangle start to build between one of our MCs and a ten-year old, I think I’ve had enough. Yashiro doesn&#039;t belong in a romance anime. I don&#039;t know what her purpose is other than being a cute, shiny child. Sometimes, the episode starts off with that little girl shedding white dust that’s probably lice and making astronaut sound effects because she thinks she’s an alien. We get entire minutes of that. It would be fine if they didn’t also occasionally show us the 10-year old’s undergarments…The cherry on top would be that one random scene where she magically gained the power of flight (which she never used again) and left the building!! Neither Adachi nor Shimamura were fazed by that at all. They were like “Yep, this is normal.”<br />
<br />
The other irrelevant side characters are Nagafuji and Hino who are just there to act as Shimamura’s friends and gradually help Adachi get accustomed to making friends. Unfortunately, they suddenly get tossed out of the foreground near the end of the anime, along with all of Adachi’s progress at communicating with others. However, in their few moments together, the audience is actually drawn to ship them as a couple, and for a short period of time, Nagafuji and Hino seem like the best ship. Their moments together surprisingly have depth, despite their short length. Their dialogue seems like everyday chat to the casual viewer, but with enough subtle romance to remind me of Oregairu and its complex, (almost) always intriguing dialogue. Unfortunately, what started out as initially cute with intimate dialogue and affectionate love slowly got too far. Though the scenes are short, the scriptwriters somehow managed to throw logic out the window. Even though they are not in a relationship, Nagafuji randomly kisses Hino on the forehead without context. That’s not too bad honestly, but considering that they’re just friends, it would be really weird if one of your friends kissed you in the forehead regardless of their gender identity right? But let’s consider this next scene: enter a random steamy bath scene where these side-characters are full-on naked and these two girls get into a bathtub together. Okay, that’s normal(?) Then, Nagafuji randomly grabs Hino’s hand and puts it right on her chest and says “I figured I’d let you touch them once in a while. You like them, don’t you?...I’m so generous, aren’t I?” As you can tell, charity doesn’t come every day for these two friends. In fact, you might even call them ‘friends with benefits’!!<br />
<br />
I know people like &quot;show not tell&quot; but this anime ain&#039;t it I tell ya. I&#039;d rather these characters told me their feelings instead of show me another head on lap scene. (Fun fact: I timed one of the anime’s mandatory head-on-lap scenes for one of these episodes and it was approximately 1 minute and 50 seconds...take what you will out of that) It’s gotten to the point where I wait for the head-on-lap scenes cause that’s the only consistency in the story writing. <br />
<br />
I haven’t even started talking about the main characters yet...Shimamura is probably the densest person you’ll ever see. Adachi has clearly made numerous advances towards her in a way that no friend would ever dare to, and Shimamura usually just accepts it since her only purpose is to remain an oblivious love interest. She has the same traits as a girl you’d find out of a dating simulator. But there are times when she breaks out of character and says the weirdest things. One time, Shimamura called Adachi over the phone to let her know, &quot;I was remembering your thighs.&quot; &quot;Yeah they&#039;re pretty nice.&quot; &quot;That was a totally normal thing to say.&quot; I wish I was taking these out of context, but these are the main points of their entire conversation. Shimamura also has shounen MC level intelligence. She took 20 entire seconds to figure out that the 25th of December was Christmas. If it wasn&#039;t for her brilliant intuition, the audience would&#039;ve never known and felt shrouded in mystery. But if you’ve watched the anime, Adachi to Shimamura, you actually start to feel bad for Shimamura and here’s why:<br />
<br />
Now I’m sure we’ve all heard the phrase, “Actions speak louder than words.” I’m gonna describe Adachi’s personality using just that!! Now imagine a scene where a person follows you around and you’re (painfully) aware of it. Now, normally, you call this stalking. But since this is a GL and a sweet female named Adachi is doing the stalking, we call it cute! There&#039;s groping and really dirty dialogue too, but you can ignore it cause it&#039;s a GL!! However, it has recently come to my knowledge that apparently people in real life do not grope each other? In my experience, every male I have come in contact with has become a fujoshi wet dream and it never fails to satisfy. We kept touching each other over and over and over!! All. The. Time.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Adachi has ought to be one of the most pathetic characters I’ve ever seen. Many episodes are spent by Adachi imagining Shimamura and herself together like any high schooler would. But as we’ve seen before, the anime likes to be very extra. Progressively, Adachi’s fantasies slowly become smut daydreams in which Adachi imagines Shimamura literally taking off her shirt and without anything down below. Adachi justifies her lewd fantasy by saying &quot;So it&#039;s pretty normal.&quot; Yes, seeing your crush without clothes on is fine &quot;because I&#039;m completely normal.&quot; Once again, I’d like to remind everyone that this never occurs in the manga. There is no purpose of these increasingly suggestive depictions of these girls other than fanservice. Don&#039;t forget the thighs either. Did I mention there are thighs? If you’re looking for an in-depth romance, particularly in the GL genre, Adachi is honestly a nightmare of a character to watch. Even though this isn’t even a harem anime, she has the same traits as every otaku male you find in bad rom-coms like Rent-A-Girlfriend. When 3 people try to make friends with Shimamura by offering to eat lunch with her, the anime tries to villainize them because Adachi is feeling the blues~even though she’s pretty much a stalker...In fact, whenever Adachi sees her crush with another human being, she bolts faster out of the room than Usain Bolt!! When your only motivation for school is a high school crush, something is definitely wrong. That’s why Adachi’s behavior is so damn disturbing.<br />
<br />
And don’t be tricked by the ‘cuteness’ of Adachi on the surface, she is definitively the most toxic character I have seen in all of Fall 2020 anime. When Shimamura mentions that she is thinking of Adachi, Adachi goes in for a hug. Awhh so cute. And then Adachi slaps Shimamura in the back 4-5 times and causes Shimamura to start coughing in pain? The volume of slap noises were so loud that it sounded like Adachi beat the shit out of Shimamura. Hands down, top 10 anime fight scene of the year. Adachi’s response was something along the lines of ‘Accidents can happen’. Shimamura is clearly really confused. And Adachi tries to condition Shimamura into giving another hug even though Shimamura is not comfortable. Shimamura asks, “Huh? You want to hug me? Uh...Why?” Shimamura is clearly creeped out. And Adachi says, “Huh? Well… Because it’s warm.” Shimamura reluctantly accepts and then Adachi goes in for a hug, trips, and head smashes right into Shimamura’s chest. Imagine if Adachi was someone male, like the MC of Rent-A-Girlfriend. Replay this entire scene.<br />
<br />
I’m honestly losing brain cells trying to analyze one of the biggest insults to visually aesthetic anime in 2020. People will try to downplay this argument with “You can’t compare heterosexual anime with BLs and GLs” and I for the most part agree. I’ve read the manga for Yagate Kimi ni Naru and watched the anime for Given, and I didn’t compare them to typical heterosexual romance anime. Why? Because Yagate Kimi ni Naru and Given had elements of self-realization and doubt that were executed in a significantly more mature and in-depth way. Not once did I ever try to insert an individual of the opposite gender because their stories were designed in a way that it was not feasible to do so. Even in the Adachi to Shimamura manga, I did not feel the need to swap one of the character’s genders because for the most part, everything was what you would find out of an inoffensive cliche rom-com. The Adachi to Shimamura anime though is NOT something that should be praised in the anime community as it is just ecchi-bait for the yuri versions of fujoshi and fudanshi fans. The plot is nonsensical, the scene transitions are nonexistent, and one of the MCs is just a moe version of the Perfect Blue stalker. Although I think the manga is something worth a shot at reading, I will never recommend this anime to anyone in my life. If you still want to watch this atrocity even after this review, be warned that you may never want to watch another GL anime again.

    First things first, I do wanna give a massive shoutout to those who have done the art and background effects in general, and when it comes to transistions when it comes to this show. Not only is the normal setting just good to look at, but some of the visuals, are just truly stunning. I highly praise the anime for that. Truly stunning and beautiful.<br />
<br />
But what is this story all about? It&#039;s a casual and relaxed kind of show, following two friends at first, hanging out together while skipping class. Though that friendship is already looking like to be something more than friendship. It&#039;s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361938">
        wonderful Yuri relationship, that seems to be progressing with each and every episode, The two characters themselves, one being more out going than the other, but it&#039;s super cute with how they interact with one another. <br />
<br />
Iit&#039;s pure, it&#039;s cute, and it&#039;s only going to get better as it goes along.<br />
<br />
They aren&#039;t the only two characters within the show though, there is this strange person who first came up in an astronaut costume, which brings a lot of mystery to it, like just who this person is? Why are they here? Which adds an element of interest towards it on top of the Yuri stuff that is going on. <br />
<br />
The sounds in this show are also very good, it really matches it all really well. All really seems to go together so well. It&#039;s a great show. Give it a go honestly, you&#039;ll love just as much as I am.

    Adachi to Shimamura is easily one of the best and most realistic romance stories I have ever experienced. One of the gems of the year.<br />
<br />
The decade is just beginning, but when it’s all said and done, I think I will look back on Adachi and Shimamura as one of the best anime of the decade. Why? It’s not often that animanga/LN’s portray Yuri in a realistic manner. Often times the girls are heavily sexualised and the romance feels like pure fanservice for horny guys. There’s only a handful of good shoujo ai series and Adachi to Shimamura is one of them.<br />
<br />
The relationship between Adachi and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369659">
        Shimamura gradually developing from acquaintances, to friends, to romance blooming is a slow and gradual progression over the course of the show and by the end, we still aren’t quite there. This is a very realistic representation of how real relationships work. Healthy ones at least. While there’s certainly some traditional Yuri and romance tropes going on in the series, for the most part the storytelling is grounded and natural.<br />
<br />
On top of handling romance well, I think Adachi to Shimamura does a great job of handling adolescence and the challenges of sexual identity. Adachi and Shimamura are at pivotal points in their lives when you begin to recognise more and more about yourself. The show presents a realistic depiction of teenager(s) coming to grips with their sexual orientation and doesn’t fetishise it. <br />
<br />
In addition to its handling of adolescence and romance, Adachi to Shimamura is just a damn cute anime. There are a lot of moments that genuinely made me squeal like a little girl because of how well executed they are. There’s some great wholesome moments that newcomers to the genre and vets alike will enjoy. I can’t recommend this series enough for anyone looking for solid romance.<br />
<br />
Adachi to Shimamura gets 10 astronauts out of 10.

    There is only one way to explain why i like this show so much without spoiling AnYtHiNg.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s cute, Adachi is cute, Shimamura is cute, everything about it is cute. <br />
<br />
The story is OK, not-so-standard but still standard enough slice of life setting with an alien popping up out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is great, cannot complain about anything in that area.<br />
<br />
The sound is good, just (not saying this as a bad thing) - Adachi didn&#039;t sound like i imagined it while i was reading the manga, but still it&#039;s cool, i expected it to be a little more high pitch-y.<br />
<br />
The characters are cute, this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361992">
        is the main reason why i enjoy and like the show.<br />
<br />
10/10 would read random manga and get surprised that it is actually getting an anime this season again

    Yuri anime is not very popular in the anime community. Many people, including me at first, think that yuri is not something that would be fun to watch. However, this anime proves me wrong. <br />
<br />
This review contains NO spoilers. Just how I feel about the anime so far into it. <br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
The story is fine, it is a romantic story that I think most people would be able to be invested in. Each slice of life episode builds up the story very nicely. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art is absolutely GORGEOUS. I was shocked in the very first episode of the series by how beautifully illustrated the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361976">
        animations and character designs are. I really like the art style, especially it is able to depict a dreamy and gloomy atmosphere in some of the emotional scenes of the anime. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The opening is great and it is very fitting for the anime. I like the sound effects and the voice actors are amazing as well. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
The character is definitely the strongest point of this show. In mere 4 episodes, the anime was able to portray the main characters in a very realistic and complex way. The romance is very very well done between the characters and it doesn&#039;t feel alien nor strange at all. I am attached to the characters and all of their dialogues and actions really help me understand their feelings and thoughts.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
I usually don&#039;t watch yuri animes and it is something that does not attract my taste. However, I had a lot of fun watching this show so far and it is enjoyable for sure. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
This show is good. I would totally recommend anyone to watch it, even the people who don&#039;t prefer yuri or never seen yuri anime before.

    Cutesy (albeit cliche), pure and wholesome (albeit tropey) Yuri, the Animation. &quot;It takes two (hands) to clap/tango&quot; as they say.<br />
<br />
A story of two &quot;magical fairy-tales&quot;: a girl and a girl (how else am I gonna say?), the former very closed up on her feelings and goes on the attacc when being able to open up to people; the latter already well acquainted with people and getting along with fellow friends at the norm. A simple dose of wishful thinking and a safe haven that the two always frequent to, starts their uncanny &quot;relationship&quot; of being simple hang-out friends. Progressing at an atypical slow burn of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369652">
        questioning their own individual morals and values that could jeopardise their &quot;status&quot; if altercations were to happen, this is the light-hearted &quot;friends or lovers&quot; Yuri relationship story of Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura.<br />
<br />
As a straight male, and having watched some Yuri high-school setting of slice-of-life shows in the past (of which Yagate Kimi ni Naru (a.k.a Bloom Into You) is one of the recent and finest examples) to having a clear expectation and perception of the genre, I still don&#039;t know what to think of this one...until this weird turquoise-haired self-proclaimed alien girl Yashiro Chikama appeared in the show, and donning an astronaut suit of her first impressions. That was when I realized that there was something interestingly magical about this, and yeap: it&#039;s Hitoma Iruma, the same mangaka/novelist that created Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko back in 2009 (anyone remember the futon-wrapped &quot;alien&quot; Erio Touwa?). As usual, Hitoma Iruma&#039;s &quot;masterful&quot; work of the sci-fi genre always leaves me hanging on what to make up for the &quot;convenient&quot; alien sub-plot (that always seems like his go-to to create some easy-going atmosphere that doesn&#039;t contribute a lot to the main plot, but whatever), and it&#039;s mostly the same here, so TL;DR: Yashiro&#039;s mostly an eccentric extra for adding into the mystical aspect.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, if you&#039;re referring to the manga adaptation of the LN, there&#039;s actually 2 different versions of different illustrators: Mani and Moke Yuzuhara. The former, a largely condensed version (with an open ending) and the latter, what the adaptation mostly follows (because that route is the best in terms of fleshed-out content and character development). Be aware that the anime constantly fluctuates the sequence of contents between both manga (sometimes both manga will have the same event, just represented differently from time to time) to capture the feel of the series in its entirety. That&#039;s something rare to see though, and props for the follow-up.<br />
<br />
With the clarification of the source materials outta the way, you might be wondering what&#039;s up with the main cast of (count not 1, but 2) Yuri relationships. Yes, Adachi and Shimamura are the main Yuri couple, but I just feel that I&#039;ve gotta give a shout-out to their classmates Taeko Nagafuji and Akira Hino (whom are also another Yuri couple and friends since kindergarten times), just sliding in for additional character effects of being casual and helping the main couple be relaxed in the school setting (and the provocative teasing goes on privately behind closed doors).<br />
<br />
Referring back to both Adachi and Shimamura though (as with Bloom Into You), going deep into the character &quot;mantra&quot; lore of the POV perception just makes the both of them feel humanly connected, and not for the sake of just being cardboard cut-outs (unlike the horrible drama-esque Citrus, that one is just too sour and salty). Going through school life and hanging out together to the realization of feelings for one another, both Adachi and Shimamura have to make big strides in keeping their &quot;romantic&quot; relationship intact (well, mostly Adachi anyways).<br />
<br />
In life, it&#039;s just like the sensitivity of friends in general, and walking into the next big step of a transitional relationship can be tough. Watching both characters dig deep into their POV world, and imaginations of how various situational circumstances could have played out (par for the course) of making headways, along with the &quot;one step closer&quot; rhetoric to fulfilling their own defining desires of &quot;friendship&quot;. Of course, not everything is &quot;a bed of roses&quot;, and the insecurities of both Adachi and Shimamura start to pop up: the former&#039;s sustained mood swings of her loner status, and puppy-like doggone loyalty to the latter from &quot;friends to lovers&quot;, and the latter&#039;s other life circumstances (from her family, to a past &quot;burden&quot; (a.k.a elementary school friend Tarumi, and with nicknames to match (Shima &amp; Taru) before being very distant growing up and heading to different schools)).<br />
<br />
The TL;DR is this: every moment of the main duo&#039;s life of reason feels very human, very real and relatable amongst all the interactions. A relatively simple premise, yet doesn&#039;t all that contrived, and an overall better execution of magnificently well-written and realistic characters.<br />
<br />
Having produced the 1st season of Go-toubun no Hanayome (a.k.a The Quintessential Quintuplets), the legendary &quot;Godfather of Manga&quot; Osamu Tezuka&#039;s self-creation of his production studio may have fallen from grace as one of the prolific anime studios of the late 20th Century, but it&#039;s not all that bad. Having said that, the production of said series (even the co-production of Dororo with MAPPA) truly was an eye-opener to see a resurgence of the studio under a new generation of staff that could compete with the likes of Shaft in both the animation department and depiction of Yuri shows, and this show is no different. With rich, detailed backgrounds and soft-coloured palettes of art that oozes the contrast between both (imaginary) expectations and reality, add in the extraordinary transitional effects of life and dreams abound, and this has got to be one of Tezuka Productions&#039; finest attractive and alluring work of recent times.<br />
<br />
Also, some pretty good sound and music across the board, and I swear that the well-talented VA Akari Kitou (after Kimetsu no Yaiba&#039;s Nezuko) is REALLY laying down her suss and on a trail-blazing roll for 2020 alone: Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun&#039;s Nene, Kyokou Suiri&#039;s Kotoko, Love Live! Nijigasaki&#039;s Kanata, Tonikaku Kawaii&#039;s Tsukasa, and now this show with Adachi, ALL of which are MC roles (and that&#039;s one impressive heck in established popularity). Of course, not forgetting Miku Itou (Shimamura), Reina Ueda (Nagafuji) and Manami Numakura (Hino) on their respective roles. A spectacular job from veteran Seiyuus, no surprises. The OST is also well-refined to the likes of cheery, jovial tunes, it&#039;s as if it was made for this show. and once again, both Akari Kitou and Miku Itou&#039;s collaborated OP pairing really did wonders (the former doing BOTH OP and ED, as if to punch our hearts with the perfect-feeling gut-wrenching emotions even further).<br />
<br />
More than just another recommended show, it&#039;s another great show to add into the line-up of the illusively Yuri genre of &quot;non-cringefest&quot; and &quot;pure as white snow&quot; feels. Now only if LGBTQ+ anime representations are influenced well into the real world, how wonderful will it be???

    Adachi to Shimamura is a light-hearted, relaxing shoujo-ai series released in this season.  Believe it or not, I was actually interested in watching this show mainly because I am a fan of the seiyuu cast, and character designs look aesthetically pleasing.  I decided to watch this, and thankfully, it piqued my interest.  It has become one of my favorite yuri series, and it&#039;s my personal favorite anime in Fall 2020.<br />
<br />
The main duo of the aforementioned names, Adachi and Shimamura, are the highlights of the show, and I would say that they are some of the best written and most relatable out of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369663">
        all the yuri series I have watched so far.  Both are extremes of emotional states all of us have felt at one time or another, and both are fundamentally flawed human beings in different ways.  Both of them called themselves as &quot;delinquents&quot; because they had a habit of skipping class. It is their gradual emotional development that makes up the substance of the series, both in general and to each other.<br />
<br />
Hogetsu Shimamura is a reasonably functional, sociable girl who just has no real attachment to life. She is unwilling to put relationships beyond the bare minimum effort towards them because she feels that human relationships are bothersome and require too much effort to maintain such balance.  She is passive, she&#039;s never takes the initiative, and she doesn&#039;t speak her preference about where the flow of time carries her.  She&#039;s also a bit of an airhead, as well as being an indifferent kind of girl, and it made her to skip class as well as not being aware of Adachi&#039;s own flaws initially.  Shimamura has two of her other friends, who are Hino and Nagafuji.  <br />
<br />
Sakura Adachi, on the other hand, is both shy and unsociable.  She&#039;s so introverted, she finds herself incapable of connecting with others because she can&#039;t clearly speak what&#039;s on her mind, and it make the entire situation difficult for her.  She is very lonely in every sense of the word, she didn&#039;t even have much of a relationship with her family. It&#039;s this suffocating loneliness that has made her to also skip class.  Adachi has finally met her first partner, Shimamura, the first person she ever truly wanted to interact with.  Then they eventually became friends and started getting into the relationship together.  <br />
<br />
Shimamura was my favorite because she&#039;s actually pretty sweet and humble, albeit she&#039;s indifferent, &amp; she likes to tease sometimes.  Also, she&#039;s voiced by Miku Itou who is my personal favorite seiyuu because of her sweet voice.  Then I noticed that Adachi has an introverted personality that is similar to mine because she and I have had some emotional problems.  It makes her especially relatable to me, and it also makes her such an interesting, well-written character.  If I&#039;m Adachi, I would feel pretty similar when I get to have a relationship with someone because I&#039;m pretty introverted myself, and I wouldn&#039;t mind at all if I can meet a person like Shimamura.  Both characters are very likable with different kinds of flaws, and both end up in relationship in a pure, simple way at a slow, but steady pace.<br />
<br />
Hino is a bubbly, petite girl who enjoys fishing, and she often complains not having friends who have a similar interest.  Her childhood friend Nagafuji is a busty, mature girl who&#039;s also an airhead, and she slaps Hino whenever Hino touches her chest.  Those two are both very lovable and entertaining, and they even give some helpful advice to Adachi and Shimamura to balance out their conflicting relationship.  Yashiro, the mascot of the series, is a girl in the astronaut suit who turns out to be a glowing blue-haired alien girl.  She really loves sweets and she can even eat them under her helmet!  Personally, I find her annoying, and she&#039;s the only part that I don&#039;t like in the anime.  She seems to be out-of-place, and I can tell that Shimamura feels irritated when she meets this alien loli.<br />
<br />
The artsyle of this is both crisp and beautiful, and I would like to give props to Tezuka Productions, which is the same animation studio that made The Quintessential Quintuplets.  I&#039;m really impressed on how beautifully illustrated the animations and character designs are, and the lighting helps highlighting the emotion scenes well. The voice acting is incredibly well done, and Akari Kito, Miku Itou, Manami Numakura, and Reina Ueda all have done an amazing job portraying their characters.<br />
<br />
To me, a plot doesn&#039;t have to be ground-breaking to make the anime enjoyable.  Adachi to Shimamura proves itself to be a highly entertaining romance anime without wasting the viewer’s time bringing up typical, nonsensical tropes, although there are some fanservice in some scenes.  The main characters are relatable and well-written, and their relationship gives me a wholesome feeling.  Adachi to Shimamura is one of my personal favorite yuri series I&#039;ve watched, and I recommend this to the fans of the slice-of-life shoujo-ai series.

    Float through the air together on a bicycle in a beautiful sunset - the cover picture of “Adachi to Shimamura” magically attracts every Yuri fan.<br />
<br />
Spending time together with a friend is definitely something we all enjoy. Eating, Chatting or just fooling around with a person we like makes us happy. Our story here is about Adachi and Shimamura, two high school girls who found each other in an unusual way to build a deep friendship… or is there even more behind it?<br />
<br />
Imagine you don&#039;t feel like attending classes and just want to crawl into your regular place upstairs in the gym where nobody can disturb

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369692">
        you. But one day you meet another girl there who has the same thoughts as you. This was the way our two main protagonists met each other and began to spend a lot of time together. From the atmosphere you can feel the harmony between them was perfect, they instantly took a liking for each other.<br />
<br />
What is a &quot;friend&quot; for you?<br />
Before meeting Shimamura, Adachi never had someone whom she can call a friend. She had an extremely introverted personality and was cold towards other people. She didn’t even attempt to make friends with other girls in the past. Shimamura changed her life in that point. Through her, Adachi found a true friend and Adachi would like to spend all the wonderful time with her alone. That’s the reason why she is also a generally, very jealous person towards Shimamura when she is together with her friends and as a consequence usually ends up running away. Beginning with a friendship, she gradually realizes that she definitely wants more than “normal friends”. She wants to be with Shimamura forever.<br />
Shimamura on the other has always been quite popular and gets along with other girls. She is polite and open for everything. Although she spends a lot of time with other people, Shimamura finds human relationship as bothersome since she feels that it requires too much effort to maintain such balance. She is a bit slow when it comes to feelings and love, but she also feels the emptiness when Adachi is not around.<br />
Besides our two main characters, the supporting characters Yashiro, Taru, Taeko and Akira also appear in the series. They don&#039;t play a major role, but Shimamura gets along with them as well. They are good friends.<br />
<br />
What really catches your eye are all the beautiful scenes where the light contrast is unusual. There is often also a slow-motion effect applied as well which makes everything even more beautiful. The art style in general goes perfectly with a story about friendship and love. The beautiful moments they spend together are emphasized in color, but also the sad and lonely ones can also be recognized by the slightly darker backgrounds. Regardless of whether it is raining, sunny or just a touching scene, the visual effects are used perfectly. It is always stunning and beautiful.<br />
<br />
There are 7.8 billion people on earth, how can you meet THE person of your life under such circumstances? Still, Sakura and Hougetsu managed to meet each other. With the OP &quot;Kimi ni Aeta Hi&quot; both show this must have been fate. Only through the other person their world become brighter and colorful. In addition to the lyrics and the beautiful music, the visual representation also shows that they will never let the other person vanish away.<br />
The ED song, performed by Adachi only, underlines again how important Shima is being as a part of her life. Adachi would give everything for her, she will always be there for her. The music is very nice to listen to here as well.<br />
In addition to the songs, some short but beautiful melodies that are played during certain scenes are also perfectly fitting.<br />
<br />
As a big Yuri fan, I was really looking forward to this anime and was not disappointed. Besides the wholesome and cute story, it&#039;s just enjoyable to follow our characters. What really surprised me in a very positive way are the visual effects, which make everything even more color- and beautiful.<br />
Everyone who is a fan of slice of life in combination with Shoujo Ai will surely love this anime. Enjoy a pure and beautiful friendship!<br />
I am sure we will see more of “Adachi to Shimamura” in the future!

    Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Adachi to Shimamura and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers present within character analysis. You have been warned. <br />
<br />
Based on a popular light novel of the same name Adachi to Shimamura otherwise better known by its Synonym Adashima is a slice of life, romance, school, and Yuri genre anime that gives us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a quiet and socially awkward girl who has few friends and was a virtual outcast within her assigned

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369672">
        class, were to one day after ditching class and in the midst of heading to her one refuge within the school where she can be herself in the form of the rarely trodden second floor of the school’s gym was to encounter for the first time in a long time in the form of another person that shared her desire for a place that can serve as a refuge. Despite the two being on virtual ends of the school spectrum the two slowly but gradually begin to hit it off forming a strong bond between them that serves to not only open up the near closed-off hearts that both possess by showing them the power that friendship and acceptance can bring but also in the process begin the journey that both must embark upon if they want to step back into society not just as friends and cats licking each other’s wounds but maybe something that transcends that of friendship if both can play their cards right. <br />
<br />
Traditionally the school-based setting when used in conjunction with the modern-day setting that we see here in Adachi to Shimamura is one that has seen great success in replicating both the slice of life and romance scenarios due to a combination of both the unique society that schools present to its occupants as well as the innate social pressure that comes from being a person living in the 21st century a timeline that has stress, aspirations, and responsibilities by the bucket load. With such a heavy burden on their shoulders combined with the unique tension that can come from the unique societies that exist within schools the danger of being labelled as an outcast and ostracized by your classmates as well as being forced to try hard to maintain existing ones to forget past pains are constant issues that many high school students have to live with. While the premise and the setting of this series is one that’s common to a degree I felt that its core theme of healing one&#039;s heart by meeting and making genuine bonds with others and relearn what its actually like to have friends that aren’t fake and whose feelings and care for you are genuine was one that was paired relatively well with the romance aspect of the series that served to create a tale that was both compelling but also heartwarming to see an aspect that I felt was one that served to brighten our days in the wake of the crisis that’s sweeping through our world IRL. The first episode of the series I felt was an excellent one that while showing well the kind of world that Adachi and Shimamura view the world around them as also did well to showcase the kind of unique relationships that both the main leads have established between them while foretelling the kind of struggles that both will have as their journey to recovery begins a tale that I felt quite compelled to follow on as I was curious as to whether will they succeed in their endeavour and a decision that I felt was really justified. <br />
<br />
Sakura Adachi <br />
<br />
Sakura Adachi portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Akari Kitou of Youkoso and Grancrest Senki fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the series two protagonists. A high school freshman Adachi from her initial appearances was seen to be a quiet, calm and confident person by nature that while intelligent and composed and someone that will have no trouble making friends was instead someone that seemingly preferred to stay away from the established groups within her class preferring instead to keep her heart firmly closed and finding refuge outside of the class. For a time this sense of finding refuge in places within the school that did not have much footfall by the rest of the school&#039;s occupants served Adachi well allowing her to find a sense of peace within the school where she can still remain herself and not needing to force herself to change her attitude to reflect that of her friends and classmates something that was all too common within schools.<br />
<br />
While itself an admirable attempt to retain one&#039;s independence of will high school life like the society that it serves is not one where one can exist in without making friends a fact that soon earned her a certain amount of notoriety within the class and saw her being labelled as a troublemaker by both her peers and the school. That is until one day when within her refuge she was to encounter another person who while was the total opposite to her in both class hierarchy and temperament was not only sharing her desire to find a place of refuge from which to shelter from the stresses that come from modern society but also surprisingly was able to get on well with Adachi and from there kindle the spark that will serve to allow Adachi to take the first steps in re-entering society by forming her first real friendship since entering high school. Though the first steps of their friendship was a shaky one due to her nervousness as well as her social awkwardness around others that she knew nothing about which was in turn supported by her reluctance to open her heart to others easily thanks to Shimamura’s kindness, patience and her desire to listen the relationship between the two rapidly progressed and soon formed into the solid foundation that served to define the core relationship that was between them. <br />
<br />
As the series progresses and we get to see more of Adachi’s personality get expanded upon it can be seen that unknown to everyone but herself that Adachi as a result of her nature and unwillingness to mix with her classmates had a fair share of issues that she was suffering from.  As a result of her reluctance to get involved with others Adachi while having no trouble in maintaining her academic performance within the class was seen to view it not with a sense of elation but rather saw each of her days in school as being one that was filled with boredom and each day being a trial that proved ever harder to surmount. While the meeting with Shimamura and later with her friends Hino and Nagafuji served to spice things up for her and make her days in school much more bearable this was only when Shimamura was present within the class. However, after meeting not only Shimamura and later Hino and Nagafuji Adachi for the first time in her life as a high school girl was to experience an aspect of life that while being a fundamental aspect of a high school girls repository was something that was until then something completely alien to her which was a sense of genuine friendship and bonds that are formed between true friends who care nothing for false modesty and instead value honesty and sincerity in their relationships. For Adachi long resigned to the fact that she will not have any close friends within the school this meeting served well to open the closed-off heart that until now had been firmly closed by her own will in a quest to protect herself and introduce her to the unique interactions and heartfelt emotions and feelings that can only come from meeting with and bonding with likeminded friends that you can rely upon for both advice and that unique warmth that only close friends can bring to one another. While hesitant and fearful of taking the first steps into re-joining the very society that had burned her in the past thanks to the interactions that Adachi had experienced with Shimamura and wanting to both repay her as well as be strong enough to be able to enjoy more time with her Adachi resolves to take the one step that she never thought she be able to take which was to enter into the stressful and cruel society that she for so long had avoided by taking part in more social activities with Shimamura and her friends and in the process relearning what it meant to be a high school girl in the modern world namely outings with friends that pass the time in the blink of an eye, visits to restaurants and cafes that served to present the cutest but also the funniest moments between friends and lastly attending special events that served to be both magical and yet also potent opportunities that allow the bonds between friends to grow ever stronger as you enjoy the magical moments together while learning something deep about them from their heart. <br />

Overall the character of Adachi I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a quiet, reclusive girl that had few if any friends to someone that was not only more assertive but also one that was brave enough to re-join the society that had inflicted such profound damage to her heart in a desire to get close to the one girl that had not abandoned her and instead bonded with her as a comrade and friend being especially heartfelt. While Adachi’s role within the relationship that she establishes with Shimamura was not as large as Shimamura’s in terms of impact I felt that the quiet sense of determination and bravery that she injects into her role within it served well to balance out the bond that exists between the two girls. <br />
<br />
Hougetsu Shimamura <br />
<br />
Hougetsu Shimamura portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Miku Itou of 5 – Toubun no Hanayome and Ryuuou no Oshigoto fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the series two main leads. A high school freshman and a fellow classmate of Adachi Hougetsu who we better know as Shimamura was from her initial appearances seen to be a quiet, calm, and perceptive person by nature that as a result of possessing both beauty and intelligence in equal measure was someone that was well-liked within the class and was noted to have many friends within her peers with Hino and Nagafuji being counted as among her closest. However unlike the great majority of her classmates who got by with false modesty and kindness geared towards joining one of the classes many circles of friends Shimamura was shown to have none of that being someone that was kind and caring and honest and direct with both words and feelings towards others aspects that while serving to push fakers away served to allow her to forge strong bonds with those that respect her for it in the form of Hino and Nagafuji. While a quiet girl for the most part Shimamura was shown to be someone that was relatively carefree in nature and was someone that was shown to have quite the sense of humour a fact that is seen well in her teasing of Adachi when they are together a fact that while cute to look at was also an aspect that I felt contrasts nicely with Adachi’s quiet and sullen self. <br />
<br />
However, as the series progresses and we get to see more of Shimamura’s personality it can be seen that Shimamura like her dear friend Adachi was also someone that had her fair share of struggles that transpired in the past that had wounded her heart greatly. While on the surface Shimamura was someone that was positive, friendly, energetic and enjoyed the company of numerous friends within her peer group beneath this it can be seen that she like Adachi was someone that had great trouble in opening her heart to others and was someone that preferred to stay away from others as much as she possibly can. However, despite this, she was shown to treasure the strong links that she has forged with those that she trusts and despite her desire to stay away from people tried hard to maintain this small redoubt within society that she uses as both a refuge and as a source of advice and amusement for her in her everyday life. While Shimamura’s core arc and struggle within the series is similar to Adachi in that it focused on her reopening her heart to others and learn to experience the sense of joy that can be found in relationships between friends that genuinely understand you I feel that this was also used well with the sense of loneliness and sense of regret that Shimamura secretly battled with within her heart. Though Shimamura was someone that was well accustomed to hiding her true feelings from others the sense of loneliness that she felt in her heart as a result of this was something that she can never use too, as try as she might in not becoming a burden to others this only served to ensure that her days before Adachi was not only long but also days that were filled with grey and boredom that almost made her days impossible to get through. <br />
<br />
However, these endless days of boredom soon vanished when Shimamura in her quest to find a place of refuge where she can pass her days without interruption was to encounter a classmate who despite being on opposite ends of the spectrum within the class hierarchy was also surprisingly someone that shared the same kind of pain that came from being an outcast that had few if any friends within the class and lacked anyone that they can trust to show their true selves too. It is after this meeting between Shimamura and this mysterious girl that calls herself Adachi that the life of Shimamura was to change profoundly for she for the first time in her life was to not only encounter someone that she was able to show her true face too but also serve as an excellent vehicle that will allow her to improve herself as a person a goal that while a hard one that has a high chance of failure was one that she was willing to try not only because she wanted to improve herself and be able to enjoy this world of colors with her own eyes and honest feelings but also because she wanted to also help bring into the world the one person that she was closest too and one that she can always rely upon to tell her the truth. While on the surface Shimamura’s relationship with Adachi and her desire to bring Adachi into the real world that is society can be seen to be one that’s almost self-satisfying in nature from an external perspective I feel that on the contrary, Shimamura’s actions and desires to improve herself by interacting with and bringing Adachi into the real world was a genuine attempt to help someone that had like her had been affected by the unique nature that modern-day society had served to create. While the teasing aspect of their relationship was one that served well to highlight the increasing closeness that their bonds have served to create between them it is within the events within the series such as Shimamura’s confrontation with Adachi’s mother as well as the Christmas date and the valentines events that serve to really show just how determined Shimamura was in not only helping herself break out of her frozen heart but also in the process reintroduce the feelings of trust and love that until meeting Adachi had never quite existed when interacting with her friends within the school. <br />
<br />
Overall the character of Shimamura I felt was an interesting one that while matching Adachi’s inner struggles relatively well with her own also served to balance out the relationship between the two by making use of her more expressive and emotional nature that really served to draw out both the sweetness and the cuteness that came from two cats licking each other’s wounds as both sought to use each other to improve themselves and break free of the chains that had until now held them back from the fun, joy, and colour that existed within the real world. <br />
<br />
AMV <br />
In terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were both well designed and developed that made great use of both simple animation techniques and soft colors that served to enhance the series already excellent animation by adding a sense of clearness to it and allowing it to display natural phenomenon that much more effectively. While the designs of the characters school uniforms that within the series served as their main hub that allowed both to meet each other without fail were relatively simple ones I felt that this sense of simplicity worked well in combination with the sense of relatability that we as the viewers were able to easily relate too as no matter which country we are from we all attended school at some point and have experienced the sense of pressure that our two heroines were seen to struggle with. Location variety wise though the series only featured a handful of locations that the cast served to visit I felt that each of these locations while simple in design were also ones that were paired well with the events and significant moments within the relationship that is established between Adachi and Shimamura with notable examples being the school gyms second floor that served as the twos sacred refuge and the place where they first met and forged their bond, the family homes of both Adachi and Shimamura that served to allow both to not only see what their own home environment was like but also in Shimamura’s case allow her to determine the true cause of Adachi’s nature that stemmed from the inattention of her mother to her daughter’s needs. <br />
<br />
Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Kimi Ni Aeta Hi which was performed by veteran seiyuu singers Akari Kitou and Miku Ito in the guise of their assigned characters in this series and Kimi no Tonari de which was performed by Akari Kitou. While both of these songs were excellent ones I felt that the kind of feelings and emotions that they invoked when used in combination with their accompanying visuals were very different with the former giving off a sense of a destined meeting between two girls who despite being on opposite ends of the spectrum within the class hierarchy had numerous things that they can easily relate too and their desire to use this meeting to break out of their respective shells no matter how hard the journey will be. On the other hand, the feelings that the ending theme served to invoke was one that while calm also served to showcase just how much the fruits of their labours together had served to introduce and enhance the bonds that the two have formed with the people around them in the form of Yashiro, Hino, Nagafuji and Shimamura’s little sister. While often neglected when compared against the series gorgeous animation I felt that the series OST was a calm and relaxing one that served to enhance the series scenes as the girls go by their life day by day. <br />
<br />
Voice acting-wise I felt that overall the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I feel that Akari Kitou and Miku Itou really served to pull off a most excellent performance portraying their respective characters of Adachi and Shimamura by infusing their characters with not only their innate skill as seiyuu’s but also a sense of chemistry within them that was both heartfelt and easily relatable to anyone that saw it. In terms of the supporting cast, while I didn’t cover their characters within the series, I felt that Iori Saeki, Manami Numakura, and Reina Ueda all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Yashiro, Akira Hino, and Taeko Nagafuji respectively. <br />
<br />
In overall Adachi to Shimamura, I felt was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points a unique premise, excellent story, characters, animation, voice acting, and a unique take on the idea that romance between two damaged girls who had both been affected by the unique pressure that modern-day society forces on you can serve to not only heal them but also serve to allow them to rediscover the path that will allow them to once more re-enter society and start their life anew. <br />
<br />
In the modern-day the life that we as inhabitants of this age live in can be ones that are incredibly stressful no matter what role we have in it. Whether we’re high school students or professionals that work in the adult world society is something that places plenty of pressure on our shoulders and while the majority of us can bear them effectively many might not be able to handle them and in the process suffer grave mental damage from them that will serve to dramatically alter their life as a result. In my eyes, while Adachi to Shimamura’s core story was one that was well-trodden within the anime world I felt that when used in combination with the feelings and emotions that the main and support cast experience as well as the impact that this has on their bonds that I feel that the story become something that was truly magical as when used in this capacity it served to both highlight and enhance the many sweet and cute moments that transpire between Adachi and Shimamura as well as their friends Hino and Nagafuji that was not only heartwarming but also serve as potent reminders to both them and us that even in this hard and high pressured world that can feel oppressive and scary there are still plenty of people who are like you that you can confide in and bond with and move forward together a fact that in this new deeply pained world that we live in is a lesson that is worth remembering. <br />
<br />
In times of a final overall score, I would say that Adachi to Shimamura easily deserves a final score of 9/10. While 2020 may have been a rather bleak year due to the pandemic I feel that this series in partnership with the equally excellent Tonikawa Over the moon for you served well to remind us of the kind of power that heartfelt feelings and bonds can have in helping us get through the harsh realities of life a lesson that we all should take heart from. <br />

    In an era where girls love and yuri titles are rare, a lesbian&#039;s gotta eat right? So I tend to watch anything that&#039;s even yuri leaning. Which is how I started watching Adachi to Shimamura in the first place. The art style is cute, the girls are fun, and there&#039;s lots of yearning. What more could a girl want? For all of that to go somewhere, probably. <br />
<br />
I have not read the manga, so I don&#039;t know if anything was resolved further there. But,,, even the Bloom Into You anime got further. I wasn&#039;t ever bored watching that; I had to skip through quite a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369702">
        bit of Adachi to Shimamura because it tended to drag on quite a bit without ever really going anywhere. There were also just some elements that felt out of place and random? Like the alien girl and Shimamura&#039;s childhood friend felt stapled on and not properly explored or explained. <br />
<br />
And... god I was hoping for a confession. It was just a lot of baiting and they REALLY leaned into the yearning. Which, is fine! I love yearning as much as anyone else! But... I prefer for that yearning to have payoff and to feel satisfying. Which, the ending of this anime just didn&#039;t. It didn&#039;t really do anything with either girls&#039; feelings and... that sucked a bit. <br />
<br />
The bits that were good were good, and I really liked the dynamic between the two leads and even the supporting cast. But... it&#039;s just too forgettable. It&#039;s very plain Jane and flowery, not really doing anything new or interesting. I really hate to be a downer and leave this series with such a bummer outlook, but I&#039;ve gotta say I&#039;m a bit disappointed with it.

    A short review of the first four episodes.<br />
<br />
The first episode had hardly convinced me because I found the story a little bit light but it was a mistake. It&#039;s a very fine anime in the demonstration of the discovery of the feelings of love, without locking itself in clichés quite specific to anime of this genre. He reminds me a little of Tsuki ga Kirei in this realistic awkwardness of the protagonists.<br />
<br />
Shimamura is really interesting because she has kept a background of innocence and naivety despite her precocious maturity. It often creates a comical discrepancy with Adachi (like when she hands her a piece of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362034">
        her cake without realizing that it results in a possible indirect kiss ; a classic anime situation but very enjoyable here). She&#039;s aware of having flaws and decides to let herself go, trying to enjoy his youth. She&#039;s a sophisticated person but prefers to hide this side of personality. A sociable girl at first sight, one quickly notices the mask she wears, which shows a lack of confidence in herself and in others. Her thoughts are addressed to us through monologues, often after her interactions with Adachi. The questions she asks herself are mostly about the relationships people have with each other. This is treated with accuracy, without falling into the trap of a character whose thoughts are too elaborate for her age. <br />
Adachi is kawai and I appreciate her a lot, but she&#039;s already a more classic character. She has the role that highlights her friend in my opinion, a more twisted character.<br />
<br />
Really, a nice surprise. I am a fan of anime romance and would highly recommend it to anyone. It&#039;s not heavy and we have side plots, including this funny astronaut, which allows us to drift a bit from the love story. I look forward to the following episodes.  <br />
<br />
8/10.

    Alright I am here to say that this ANIME represents teenage wlw relationships TO THE TEE. As an 18 year old lesbian, I have somehow related or have seen every aspect of their journey to recognizing and embracing their romantic feelings for each other. The little details on how they act and what they say all completely represent a high school gay relationship. Usually in anime, if there is a gay storyline it&#039;s completely overdone and not relatable whatsoever. This one is NOT THAT. I swear this anime had to been written by at least one lesbian because there are lesbian secrets in this show

    For a show written by the same author as Denpa Onna, I wouldn&#039;t have imagined myself to be so enamoured by, and so engrossed in Adachi to Shimamura. In many ways, it is a refinement of Denpa Onna&#039;s ideas and themes, polished to a mirror sheen and given incredible focus to its subject matter.<br />
<br />
Adachi to Shimamura stars the titular couple, a pair of socially awkward introverts (though Shimamura makes an effort to seem outgoing) with copious amounts of inner monologues throughout the whole series. What makes the show so relatable, is that, in spite of the heavy narration, Adachi and Shimamura feel like real people.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369661">
        It&#039;s very easy to empathize with either of them and the strong writing does wonders to make these people seem so natural in their behaviour and in their conversations with each other and with others. It&#039;s honestly refreshing to watch the very first episode and be impressed with how the conversations turned out, i.e. it&#039;s very much something you would have with someone else, a very realistic and natural conversation, about nothing at all, yet entirely encapsulating nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The series gives a strong focus to Adachi and Shimamura&#039;s progressing relationship, with the irony that Adachi becomes more awkward and embarrassed around Shimamura the more she starts to realize her feelings for her. Unlike the scatterbrained Denpa Onna, AdaShima is comparatively razor sharp in its focus, with the occasional digression to look at the lives of Hino and Nagafuji (itself a foil to Adachi and Shimamura&#039;s relationship) as well as Shimamura&#039;s sister and Denpa Onna canon immigrant Yashiro (a different one, but related to the Yashiro from Denpa Onna). Adachi&#039;s dorkiness is incredibly adorable and her turning into a puppy or spilling her spaghetti in front of Shimamura is really cute. But I do enjoy how both characters do slowly work towards building their romance with each other. <br />
<br />
Refreshingly, there is little to no drama or substantial love triangle in this show, unlike the very similar YagaKimi where Touko going through an identity crisis built into the main drama/conflict of self-identity and discovery. AdaShima is very relaxing and comfy by comparison, offering very pleasant visuals paired with a soothing soundtrack as you witness the two go through their day-to-day. The surprising thing is that there is never a dull moment in the show, glacial as the pacing may be, every moment centered around Adachi or Shimamura does something in progressing or exploring their relationship with each other or with the outside world. Tarumi&#039;s inclusion does raise Adachi&#039;s jealousy by a fair bit, but she never becomes a rival in the same way as say, Sayaka from YagaKimi (which coincidentally received a spinoff spotlight LN by the same author, and of which Tarumi heavily resembles in voice and in role), at least this far into the show. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a somewhat ethereal flow to the conversations and their depictions in the show. Very dreamlike, sci-fi-like, or floaty. The kind of conversations that make your mind wander off, yet pay close attention to in the same time. Maybe Yashiro&#039;s presence is rubbing off on me with her alien-like abilities toying around with the cast every so often. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re ever tired of cliched will-be-wont-be&#039;s or drama-heavy romance series, AdaShima may just be the cure for you. Its pace is incredibly slow, but it does work for the kind of series it is: A relaxing thought-provoking look into the minds of two introverts who fall in love with each other, with a very real approach to its dialogue and inner monologues.<br />
<br />

    Adachi and Shimamura are inseparable friends who spend their days talking about the most different types of things. However, Adachi begins to see Shimamura with different eyes and, little by little, the friendship between the two begins to become something much more complicated to deal with.<br />
<br />
It is very noticeable how Adachi to Shimamura tries to express himself with a more sensory approach in a very intimate way. The entire good level of anime production (of course, together with Artistic System thought by the director) is committed to causing sensations that have relations with the elements of the plot, but which, unfortunately, does not progress as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383160">
        expected.<br />
<br />
The first episode at least shows this very well, it has many organic elements that guide our look while we get to know a little of the story and the characters. Whether they like it or not, the characters act in ways that leave clues as to how they feel about this relationship, but that never open up to each other, it is a somewhat mysterious relationship. And the anime tries to explore a sensory side of it.<br />
<br />
The anime also makes quite a lot of very expressive details. Sometimes small gestures or experimentation. There is a commitment to show us small details and actions that cause an effect, that have an impact through the visual in an intimate way as these characters face each other, talk, play etc.<br />
<br />
With the passing of the episodes, the anime follows this same approach until the end, which would not be a problem, put following the progress of the plot (which becomes more complex, desolate and subtle) the anime in theory should improve, but the what happens is just the opposite. The big problem that gets in the way of this whole system of the director, is an unnecessary verbiage. The characters speak very expositively as they are feeling in relation to these feelings, and this causes a creative conflict in the work. Let&#039;s see. While the aesthetic interest of the work is to pass on such sensations and feelings to us through a more organic and sensory approach, all of this loses its meaning and the work tells us how they feel. There is a scene that is so self explanatory that the character even explains the analogy in the middle of it. Almost all of the more experimental value is thrown away, and the anime is almost just that.<br />
<br />
There is another scene of even more significant value that also loses much of its meaning due to this verbiage. We know that for Sakura Adachi&#039;s character, walking hand in hand has a very strong value (or at least it should have). Later in the anime, when Hougetsu&#039;s childhood friend Shimamura takes her hand, there is a very evident detail in this action. This act of walking hand in hand should have a very strong value, but it is also wasted.<br />
<br />
Another choice that didn’t make any sense, and that perhaps was purely formalistic, are the transitions between 16: 9 for Cinemascope. Cinemascope is such a proportion of the screen more vertically closed. I might even think that this is a representation of the characters being submissive in some way, but the anime only uses it at random.<br />
<br />
In short, Adachi to Shimamura is a work that tries to deal with a conflicting plot in a very expressive and innovative way, but that prevents the viewer from feeling such emotions due to differences in the way it is staged.

    (TLDR Review at the bottom, as always, thanks for reading)<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get the important questions over and done with.<br />
<br />
Is AdaShima a yuri anime the community knows and loves with excessive kissing and other unholy actions?<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Is AdaShima a wholesome love story that will inevitably take part in fuelling various wholesome forums and anime boards across the internet?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Now for the review.<br />
<br />
AdaShima is a pleasant anime to arise from what is now a playground consisting of generic isekai, hyped (but by no means bad) shounen anime, and other heavily anticipated anime deriving from popular manga and creators. I won&#039;t lie, this year has given some other decent romance anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369654">
        to remember, but I don&#039;t think they had the same touch as AdaShima, as in the touch of youthful school romance you usually get from your average school shoujo non-comedy anime such as Kimi ni Todoke and Say &quot;I Love You&quot;. It is a nice addition to go forward with, whether it be with the romance genre or the Shoujo Ai genre or the anime seasons that awaits us. Every now and then a simple school story that doesn&#039;t converge with what else is in the air won&#039;t hurt. It acts as an equalizer, if you like, that doesn&#039;t usually appear in this day and age. <br />
<br />
<br />
Narrative:<br />
I said AdaShima is a simple school story, to be more precise, a simple school love story. And yes. It is quite literally that. There isn&#039;t any quality of the anime to fish out as majorly impressive or distuginging to sit through, albeit there were elements from the characters that did annoy me slightly which I will get onto later. In watching this story though, one thing that did get out to me was the presentation and execution. Something about AdaShima made me feel like I was reading a story, as in if it were in a book format, whilst concurrently watching an anime. If you don&#039;t already know, AdaShima originated as a light novel if I am not wrong. In my time of reading light novels, I must say, the detail into character thoughts and the viewpoints of surroundings and behavior is greatly enhanced. The anime does this through countless amounts of internal monologue, and not in a way that it was like the narrator from Peppa Pig, it is just the simple yet perplexing thoughts of your teenage girls that have fallen in love. Such a technique isn&#039;t new. But it does allow for interesting perspectives and looks into the behaviour of our protagonists. It makes them more human to look at rather than characters that exist to do things in some plot. Honestly, not a bad way to go around with such a simple story. With the pacing of the story, it wasn&#039;t too slow, but it wasn&#039;t fast either, if I had to say, it leans more onto the slow side of things, which in turn gave it that mood of realistic growth in the atmosphere rather than something that comes out of a 13 y/o teen relationship that exists just to get that street cred from classmates. Whilst it is a little slow, it is nothing that will make you fall asleep.<br />
<br />
The characters are somewhat interesting to focus on. I don&#039;t like dumb characters. I just don&#039;t know why someone would do dumb things. But the preception of what is &#039;dumb&#039; and not all boils down to relativity, especially with emotions. Adachi is a good example of this. To me, Adachi did quite a lot of stupid things, though looking at the romance genre and everything it has given, her actions are to be expected and, not surprisingly, liked to some extent. In other words, she is your average romance protagonist. However, that doesn&#039;t excuse her from the stupid actions that you may be tired in seeing constantly. She is a jealous girl, and an iffy one too. Not that I have many emotions to begin with, but damn, I have seen this Adachi-kinda-girls more times than I have seen shounen plot armour. It is annoying to view nevertheless. The number of times Adachi gets jealous of whoever the hell Shimamura interacts with, or the silly amount of times she stops talking to Shimamura or runs away from her. It is undoubtedly some of the most generic plot devices for a dramatic atmosphere. But as I said, the story is simple, it is to be expected. Though, recalling back to my earlier statement of humanisation, it makes her more human, I mean half the times she has some of the most innocent of wet dreams when it comes to thinking about Shimamura. She is a loner. A teenager. Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if she hated &#039;insta normies&#039; too. But yeah, she is what you would expect of someone who just fell in love. She has all the stupid qualites and the redeeming ones too. Even though I have said some negative things about her, she does fine as a character for this story.<br />
<br />
Shimamura is another engaging one to focus on. One could say she is denser than Osmium, or she is CEO of confused.com. Though in seriousness, I thought that she was indeed slightly dense and confused when it came to her tremulous relationship with Adachi. You see Shimamura&#039;s feelings towards Adachi are fogged. You can&#039;t say she has the same feelings as Adachi to her, however, you can&#039;t say that she is looking at her as just a friend. Friendzoned, if you like. I can never really tell what Shimamura truly thought about Adachi other than someone she really enjoys being with. You can tell what she will do next, but I was not convinced about her true motives in the event something went in a peculiar fashion. In her presence of taking up screen time, she has shown that she does question quite a bit of things mostly revolving around the people she spends time with, whether she has spent time well or not. But other than that, and her relation with Adachi, she isn&#039;t one that can be easily deciphered. Not a bad character, but not the star-of-the-show. Just a really thoughtful (the thinking kind) girl.<br />
<br />
Side characters, you could do without, their presence and impact on the story means little hence why I said that, they are not anything vile, but given how most of the story is focused on Adachi and Shimamura (surprisingly, as if the title wasn&#039;t enough), it felt as if that the side characters didn&#039;t need to exist in the slightest. It probably would have made for a more bland anime, so I give thanks that the side characters do exist, though they are indeed just useless to anything to push the plot forward, even Yashiro who was this alien from out of nowhere didn&#039;t mean much after episode 3 or somewhere close to it. A sad loss. But I wouldn&#039;t mourn over it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals:<br />
The visuals were good. Very good. Polished and detailed so much so that it actually feels like something from this generation of anime. I mean, don&#039;t tell moi u don&#039;t luv dem lips, u know u want dem close ups. Although, if you pictured a random scene as if they were landscapes, background visuals don&#039;t hold up to the character designs, which is kinda disappointing. Animation-wise, it felt slow, like the writer got so immersed with the slow pacing that they decided to jump onto one of the animation PCs and start animating. It has this slightly choppy flow to it which made for a few scenes that would trigger for a few giggles to come out unintentionally, like when Adachi physically runs away from Shimamura. Nothing appalling or unwatchable, but it is just a slight hiccup that disenchanted the experience.<br />
<br />
I swear I binge watched AdaShima and I have come out not remembering any of the OST, I really believe that it was that &quot;in the moment&quot; kind of OST being played as supposed to something intentionally made to stay in your head. Saying this, I will admit that I don&#039;t have the best memory in the world. However, not even one soundtrack has stuck with me since. I wouldn&#039;t say the sounds are bad though, as I willingly try to recall sounds played, for that, I would probably remember more than not. OP and ED were different, they stuck with me and were actually very nice to hear, it had that smoothing feel everytime you listen to it. Seiyuus were good. Basically what you would expect from anime like this. Nothing too deep or enlightening to report on that matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Hey, I love me a good romance. Regardless of how cliche or foolish the characters are. I literally used to live on r/wholesomeanimemes at one point, so you can get where I am coming from. The enjoyment was splendid. The pair were going out bowling, feeding each other, holding hands, resting on each other&#039;s thighs. You can&#039;t tell me that isn&#039;t wholesome. Simple things like that were very enjoyable for me, and maybe will be enjoyable for those who watch this. The whole light novel presentation idea was very enjoyable for me as well, diving into character thoughts does make for some well played enjoyment. Tells me to get back to reading soon lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 6.8 (7)<br />
<br />
----------<br />
TLDR Review:<br />
Story - 7: Simple love story, played as if it were a light novel.<br />
Visuals - 7: Good character design, but somewhat choppy animation<br />
Audio - 6: Good OP and ED, though nothing memorable from OST, most are made for &quot;in the moment&quot;<br />
Characters - 7: Adachi is slightly dumb, but an expected character. Shimamura is mysterious. Side characters mean nothing at the end of the day.<br />
Enjoyment - 7: Very wholesome romance, execution if really fun to immerse in as well.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6.8 (7)<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Really can&#039;t say I have final words for AdaShima, I mean, everything I have been meaning to say has been covered. I have every intention of reading the light novel, so I should enjoy that hopefully. I am just going to say I recommend this to anyone who wishes to watch this. It is nothing groundbreaking, you probably won&#039;t get much out of it, but it is there if you are either new to the genre or just want more decent anime to watch.<br />

    Story:8<br />
Art:10 (some people might be bothered by camera angles BTW)<br />
Sound:10<br />
Character:10<br />
Enjoyement:10<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
Story:8 -- adachi to shimamura is a slow yet pleasantly pased romance set in school, this is not the ambitioust part of the anime, nor it is the main reason to watch it, BTW; the storytelling, something usually overlooked is great, the inner conflicts of characters drive at least 50% of the plot.<br />
<br />
Art:10 -- beautiful character design, specially how vivid eyes are, backgrounds usually vary colors to fit the feelings of scene and characters, slow motion scenes to fit dialogue, the only questionable part is light fanservice, I&#039;m not bothered by it but some people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367517">
        can find it disgusting<br />
<br />
Sound:8 -- sound fits perfectly with scenes, it&#039;s definitelly not innovative, but it works perfectly, opening and ending are fine, but not something to remember later<br />
<br />
Character:10 -- best part of the anime, they look like real and normal people, the internal conflicts are seriously taken, the self-acceptance is a strong driver for character development, there are also theories around about a main character suffering a disorder, I&#039;ll not spoil here, but novel readers have a point there, and is trully incredibly well driven <br />
<br />
Enjoyement:10 - slow romance showing in credible ways such life transitions and self-acceptance conflicts, I have to say, I couldn&#039;t believe who the author of the novel was... this is just too good compared to his previous work...<br />
<br />
Overall: 10 -- all that said, I&#039;m really enjoying this anime

    Yuri/Shoujo ai anime isnt for everyone. But i like some of them, and this anime is one of Yuri anime i like. The story isnt heavy and maybe related to some ppl for communication thing with others.<br />
<br />
Adachi and Shimamura is wholesome show, its heartwarming and the art is beautiful. For the characters, i can related myself to Adachi somehow lol. The story isnt heavy like other similar anime genre, but Adachi and Shimamura are adorable and cute.<br />
<br />
The opening song is nice and the ending song is good too, so you wont skip this. Overall i enjoy the show and hope theres season 2 to complete

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373600">
        Adachi and Shimamura development relationship.<br />
<br />
If youre looking for &quot;friendship&quot;, a bit of shoujo ai with beautiful graphics and arts you will like this. My final verdict is 9/10 coz the excecution of this anime is great imo.
