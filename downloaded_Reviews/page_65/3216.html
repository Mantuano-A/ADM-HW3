    Oh, my dear Amanchu!, what happened to you? I don&#039;t remember you being so messy. I don&#039;t remember you being so unrelatable. And I certainly don&#039;t remember you being so mediocre.<br />
<br />
Amanchu! Advance is really a textbook example of how sequels should not be made.<br />
<br />
Before we start, it is important to express what does the original Amanchu! mean to me. I&#039;ve always been a fan of Slice of Life. However, it is always very hard to find a SoL with good characters, healing atmosphere and, most importantly, enough entertainment value. Amanchu! had all of those and to this day I consider it to be the third

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282008">
        best anime of this genre I&#039;ve seen. So, you can guess that I was really looking forward to its second season. And it hurts me to say that it left me disappointed.<br />
<br />
The daily stories of Amanchu! were one of the things that made the original series so good. If they were dramatic, comedic or both, they always managed to be impactful and brought a message with themselves. In which we get to the first huge problem of Amanchu! Advance. That it refrains from doing things the same way as before. The first hit comes very early on, with an episode about dreaming and flying on a broom. Oh no, Amanchu!, ghost stories are really not the way to go. Sadly, the show doesn&#039;t think so and decides to continue. Which is a decision that comes back to haunt it immediately. The dream stories are not very interesting, drag on for a huge amount of time and the fact that everything is a dream also makes them feel less touching, meaningful and nowhere near as impactful as before. In comparison to the daily stories it presents at the start, they are a huge dropout, both quality and entertainment wise. <br />
<br />
This is not where things end however. The character department is also a place the creators wanted to add in. And so we are presented to a couple of more and less important newcomers to go along our original core five. First of them is Kokoro-chan, a tsundere-ish kid trap... *sigh* Do I need to say more? ; Actually, let&#039;s keep this unbiased; Kokoro is a beautiful case of a character who gets a lot of screen time yet ads absolutely nothing to the show. His only role, despite appearing in most of the episodes, is to fall in love with Pikari and act like a kid. What I always liked about the characters of Amanchu! is that they all had their purpose. They were helping Teko with her diving training or they had their own little moments here and there. If Kokoro hasn&#039;t been in the show, literally nothing would&#039;ve changed. Hell, he doesn&#039;t even bother telling others that he&#039;s a boy, even though he knows that everyone thinks of him as a girl. If you really had to add a childish character, as if Pikari herself wasn&#039;t childish enough, you really could&#039;ve done a better job. Like with the other new character Kodama, Pikari&#039;s little sister. She has layers and overall felt like she brought a bit of common sense to the group, even though she appeared very little sadly. If she got all the screen time the show wasted on Kokoro, maybe I wouldn&#039;t be writing this review.<br />
<br />
Another area I didn&#039;t expect would happen is the yuri-bait feeling. As far as I remember, the first season didn&#039;t have any moments that would bait you into shipping characters. Because of that, it remains a huge mystery to me why do characters suddenly battle for Pikari&#039;s heart now. Why not leave them just friends? Do the people behind this seriously believe that the cringe-worthy dialogues about who loves Pikari more add anything to the show? Well, they technically could. But not when you know that nothing is ever going to happen. You know that nobody&#039;s going to ever express their feeling, you know that they&#039;ll stay just friends in the end. Then why all this battling for Pikari&#039;s heart? I just don&#039;t get it. The yuri-bait cliche which arose in the last couple of years is really starting to annoy me. And that is coming from a guy who normally very much loves yuri.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also important to talk about the satisfaction factor this series brings. Because of all the things mentioned above, the original Amanchu! is one of the most satisfactory shows I&#039;ve had the pleasure of seeing. At the end of every single episode I had a wide smile on my face and was genuinely happy. With Advance, not so much. There are a couple of episodes that focus on everyday&#039;s life, and these are all very good. However, as I said, the ghost episodes in particular feel very weird and not like something you can relate to anymore. Their purpose in general is very questionable, as I don&#039;t think there is any particular reason they were thought up in the first place. That as a whole brings the satisfaction factor of the show much lower than I wanted it to be.<br />
<br />
The animation and sound both stayed very much the same as in the first season. Character drawings are still very good, though I think they used chibi cheap faces way too much this time around. Backgrounds are still good, everything looks clean and sometimes it has very nice shots. I could very well be lying right now but I think the OST stayed almost the same as in the first series. Which is not a problem, because it is still generally very good and atmosphere fitting. Other than that, everything good.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Believe me when I say that I have nothing against adding or changing things for the greater good. I really don&#039;t. However, why did the creators decided to add elements that were destined to worsen the show lies beyond me. It hurts me to say, but Amanchu! Advance is a failure of a sequel. It&#039;s the same show deep in heart, but the things around changed so much you have to dig way deeper than before to find its real value. And that&#039;s a shame, especially for a small-audience show like Amanchu!.<br />

    I’m just gonna be straight: if you love the first season, there’s no reason to not follow the 2nd season…right? Unfortunately, this new season is an awful disappointment and a big step down from what was already founded of the previous season 2 years back.<br />
<br />
Anybody who is a fan of Amanchu! and/or Amano Kozue’s works will know that she is the one who created the Aria series, one that stresses on the light-hearted SoL features that we have come to know and love, and the same thing is brought forward to the manga adaptation of Amanchu!.<br />
<br />
The pivotal point is where the first season ended with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282004">
        the first 20 or so chapters adapted into what as considered as an impressive feat in its time, and the second season attempted some ideals that quite frankly, don’t one mesh quite as well as what was already done with the all-new supernatural settings (the story of Peter Pan, the school’s ghost arc) and stuff that’s NOT about scuba-diving.<br />
<br />
Blame the anime adaptation all you want, but Amano-sensei has her faults too, because when you feel the main plot device of your series is getting stale, and you try injecting some new things that just don’t resonate with your viewers, you know the feeling that you have lost some dedicated fans when we crave for more of the plot device that keeps us entertained and showcases what the series is all about.<br />
<br />
At first, while I realized that the original team for Season 1 is back to reprise their roles (albeit with a new director), I immediately thought that it was the director’s fault for not choosing to adapt the manga chapter stories evenly, because for Season 1 it was ¾ scuba-diving and the rest SoL, but this season went the other rout and gave us less former and more latter, which mind you by the way, isn’t bad but kinda lost its footing in the process.<br />
<br />
The good stuff:<br />
Pikari, Teko, the Ninomiya siblings and Katori-sensei still live on with their lives, albeit SoL-ish and more of the same, and that’s not bad. The characterization in Amanchu! has never been the strong suit (but it does when it comes to scuba-diving), and I certainly can STILL appreciate it for what it is.<br />
<br />
J.C.Staff’s art and animation are also consistent across the board, and made me feel like I’m re-watching more of less the same from the foundations of the first season, I’ll give the acclaimed studio that of its professionalism.<br />
<br />
The bad stuff:<br />
Aside from the new director (which I’ve heard it’s a 2nd-rate one) whom IMO has no idea how to pitch this new season with the weird stories and such that it became a huge turn-off, I never appreciated the story arcs presented here (VERY particularly the Peter Pan arc, the one with supernatural dreams that span times past and future), because it didn’t click well with the main series, and as a manga reader, that is exactly the same sentiments I have here (and it spans 30+ chapters in the manga before getting back into the plot device). The SoL-esque segments also didn’t quite have the same sentiments as Season 1, so it was nothing but dull the entire way through.<br />
<br />
The music, particularly the OST, is not as well made as Season 1. While I have a soft spot for musical OSTs, what was featured here are good on their own, but nothing made me want to listen to them again (therefore making them Side-B tracks). I absolutely love the OST in Season 1 because it resonated with the series (as an introduction), but Season 2 made me lose faith in the series in terms of musicality, and just became a copy-paste thing.<br />
<br />
In the end, is Amanchu! Advance a good follow-up? Yes and no.<br />
Yes, if you want more of the characters and the art and animation,<br />
No, if you are anime-only and/or have watched Season 1 and wanting to know whether if Season 2 retained much of the quality that’s to be expected of the series.<br />
<br />
It’s not bad really, but I wished it could be better. Just a decent follow-up when all is said and done.

    Some people count sheep, I count Amanchu&#039;s moe faces. Without a doubt, the latter is more efficient when it comes to falling asleep, and when I do, I sleep like a baby. No, I do not mean that I wake up every 2 hours, cry, shit myself and suck titties. I mean I sleep without worries, wearing some sort of moe face myself, and it&#039;s great. <br />
<br />
This second season is much like the first one in terms of story. Slice of life silliness, school time and scuba diving. Everything there needs to be for the series to work. No one really cares what the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282000">
        is so let&#039;s focus on things that make this show good.<br />
<br />
Our characters are the epitome of kindness and happiness, but just like last time: never too much so. If there was any problems with Aria, it was how overly sweet it could be at times, making it almost nauseating to watch over and over again. The author has fixed this with Amanchu, making the whole cast well-balanced. <br />
<br />
The art is amazing. According to anonymous 4chan source, the series has had over 1200 different moe faces by far. The nature&#039;s backdrop alone is soothing to watch, and whenever there is animated water present, I can almost smell the fresh air. It&#039;s hard to believe that J.C. Staff can create something like this.<br />
<br />
The sounds are the best part of this show. I have seen the first season something like 6 times, 4 times practically eyes closed. You don&#039;t really need to even watch it to see it. The music is beyond calming and voice acting is almost ASMR. If there ever was an anime that needed to be watched while wearing headphones, it is this one right here.<br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment, Amanchu has given me a lot. Sometimes I put it to play in the evening before I go to bed, and it helps me to relax and fall asleep. It&#039;s rare for any series to do this to me. Non Non Biryori and Nichijou are practically the only others that give me this. Amanchu is and probably will always be my favorite healing anime. <br />

    In the summer of 2016, J.C.Staff released an anime based on a manga by the creator of Aria. This element alone was enough to get some people’s eyes to light up, but the anime also featured diving, strong friendship/possible yuri subtext, cute animals, and memorable verbal tics. This anime went by the name of Amanchu!, and was a moderate success with fans of slice of life anime, as well as those who either were familiar with or were fascinated by knowing more about the sport of diving. <br />
<br />
Two years later, a second season has come onto the scene. While every fan seemed to initially welcome

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282002">
        it with open arms, this season has taken some directions that has the fanbase split.<br />
<br />
For one thing, there’s the matter of the show completely abandoning the diving aspect of its first season for several episodes. This feels a lot more like a normal “slice of life”, as we watch the characters do things like set up for the school festival and celebrate Teko’s birthday. This may be disappointing to those who enjoyed the diving focus in the first season, though it’s not completely abandoned and has a few moments in the spotlight of the show.<br />
<br />
There’s also the introduction of what at first appear to be a one-off side character - an older, dark-skinned child named Kokoro, who strives to “become a man” despite their feminine appearance. (I won’t spoil their true gender identity.) However, this side character continues to pop up in the series, and shows a mild romantic interest in Teko. Some have called this character a “yuri killer” and a flaw in the series.<br />
<br />
The third (and final) negative point against Amanchu! Advance compared to the original is the introduction of a three-episode arc that seems like an odd shift in tone from the rest of the series. This arc focuses on the supernatural, introduces a new character, and gives them a backstory associated with a minor character we haven’t spent much time with before. The first episode of this arc was moderately interesting...then it dragged on for two more episodes, for the most part Teko and Pikari-less. It honestly felt like the Endless Eight, and so did the fan reaction in the forums/comments I saw. (“Is the arc over this episode?” “Yes.” “Oh, thank god.”) The original author has a thing for supernatural elements, since they also made an appearance in Aria, but it worked much better there than in this more down-to-earth series. This arc also would have made more sense as OVAs then smack dab in the middle of the second season.<br />
<br />
So, since I’ve spent all this time complaining about Amanchu! Advance, why have I still given it a 6/10 score? (Some might consider that a bad score. I don’t. There’s ten points on the system for a reason.) Well, Teko and Pikari are still cute and perfect for each other, even if the show tries to stomp on my dreams by introducing a “rival.” They have some great scenes together much like the original. The more slice of life esque episodes have some humorous moments. Our cute mascots are still present and charming. Ai even seemed to abuse her brother less this season...or perhaps she just wasn’t around as much.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would recommend Amanchu! Advance to anyone who enjoyed the characters enough in the first season that they would want to spend more time with them rather they’re diving or not. If you got into the first season for the diving aspect, you might not have a pleasant experience with this season.

    I don&#039;t like this season the same way I liked season one.<br />
<br />
For one thing, the influx of supernatural elements is way too sudden and strange. Why is a realistic slice of life show about friendship, diving, and discovering yourself suddenly having episodes where there are witches and ghosts, dreamlands, and time travel? Even if some of the unrealistic things happen in characters&#039; dreams, it&#039;s such a sharp change in tone that I can&#039;t help but be confused and utterly uninterested.<br />
<br />
And while I&#039;m on the topic of being uninterested: There&#039;s nothing about any of the characters or plot that keep me drawn to the show at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281431">
        all. Almost anything and everything that happens is essentially forgotten and never addressed again, and I have never once found the ability to care about anything that occurred this season. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not exactly bad... But there&#039;s nothing in Amanchu Advance that draws in the viewer and makes them want to stay the way there was in season one. There&#039;s too much going on that has nothing to do with the original genre and plot, and it makes me sad to see that a show with so much potential is being wasted doing things that make no sense and don&#039;t even matter in the long run.

    Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Amanchu Advance and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. <br />
<br />
Based off a popular manga of the same name Amanchu advance is the sequel to the popular first season of the series that aired in the summer of 2016 and following on from the ova gives us the opportunity to see how much Futaba has changed after meeting Hikari and the members of the dive club and discovered how much fun the world of diving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282005">
        has brought her and how this has changed her. <br />
<br />
Taking place weeks after the OVA the overall story of the series continues to follow the life of Futaba Ooki aka Teko as she continues to enjoy her new-found life in the town of Shizuoka where she spends her days attending school as a regular schoolgirl and at the same time diving deep underwater with the members of the diving club all the while striving to continue to improve herself and make as many happy memories as possible. Joining Teko in her quest to both improve herself and to make many happy memories is a host of characters that include Teko’s best friend the ever-energetic Hikari aka Pikari, the laid back but surprisingly perceptive homeroom teacher Mato and the kind and caring but surprisingly hot-blooded Ai Teko and Pikari’s senior within the dive club. <br />
<br />
Together with her friends Teko in this summer and the year after will encounter and meet many different situations and characters that will not only involve them in many unusual situations but also allow them to meet and befriend many unusual people that will have a profound impact on the lives of Teko and her friends and allow them to forge even stronger bonds with each other as they overcome challenges together.  <br />
<br />
Hikari <br />
<br />
Hikari voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Girlish Number and Hundred fame is one of the main characters of the series and is both Teko’s classmate and a fellow member of the schools diving club. A positive, direct and caring person by nature Hikari who has been nicknamed Pikari by her friends and fellow classmates is a friendly and persistent person by nature that tries hard to make new friends whenever she meets someone that interests her.  A kind, caring and perceptive person by nature Hikari while boastful to a degree is also someone that’s friendly and tries to help others whenever possible whether she knows that person or not. While somewhat absent-minded by nature Hikari is someone that can also be surprisingly responsible and determined at times and on top of her direct nature can also be pretty bold at times and willing to do things that most people will find odd such as calling someone out when on the streets rather than wait for an opportunity to greet them face to face as others would. While an overly cheerful and positive person Hikari is also someone that can be considerate of others and is quick to notice when someone’s mood is down. A prominent trait of Hikari is her ability to stay positive and cheerful at all times a task that she takes care off by finding things that interest and amuse her in the areas around the town that she calls wonders which can range from simple things like funny shaped fruits to rare things like an octopus fighting off competition for its future home. This aspect of her personality I felt matched well with Hikari&#039;s nature as a go lucky and energetic schoolgirl. <br />
<br />
Arguably the most prominent part of Hikari’s character is her friendship and relationship with her best friend Teko. As a result of meeting Teko back in the first season and finding someone that was both amusing and at the same time very similar to her in terms of personality Hikari has become fast friends with Teko and it can be seen that their friendship is something that she values highly. This is shown in her constant attempts to get Teko involved in her many actions within the series. As a result of seeing all the efforts that Teko has made both in trying to improve her personality and her skills as a diver, Hikari is shown to be very proud of Teko and is often shown to be elated when she see’s the former in a happy mood. Conversely, Hikari is also able to sense when Teko is sad and discouraged which shows the strong bond that has been formed between the two. Despite her positive and cheerful nature, it can be seen that Hikari like Futaba is someone that fears the future as she knows that someday that she and Futaba will be forced to leave each other as their lives proceed on to the next stages showing that beneath her cheerful demeanour Hikari also fears being alone once more. As a result, it can be seen that the reason for Hikari’s overly friendly and cheerful nature is because she wants to prolong this point in time and make as many great memories before the end comes. The character of Hikari I felt was an interesting character that did a great job of reminding us that while the time of youth is not infinite there is no reason why that should stop you from enjoying that time with your friends because while these times may past memories will last forever within your minds. I felt that her seiyuu Eri Suzuki really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Hikari. <br />
<br />
Futaba <br />
<br />
Futaba voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Guilty Crown and Anohana fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A positive, calm and intelligent person by nature Futaba while a quiet person is also someone that is kind and caring towards all she meets and can also be surprisingly perceptive at times. As a result of being introduced to the world of diving by Hikari and the members of the diving club and of the freedom and independence that diving can bring to her Futaba’s personality has changed substantially from her past self. While still quiet to a degree Futaba in this season is shown to be more confident and able to interact with others more easily without becoming overly nervous and at the same time willing to enter new areas that her past self would never would have dreamed of entering showing the many changes that meeting Hikari and the members of the dive club had on her. In line with this new-found confidence of hers Is Futaba’s determination to be more responsible and independent that comes from her desire to not rely on others too much. <br />
<br />
While more confident this season Futaba still fears the unknown to a degree and can still get discouraged at times. However unlike in the past when she would no doubt have given up on the endeavour Futaba as a result of her determination to improve herself and of her desire to stand equal to Pikari instead perseveres showing her determination to be able to stand alongside Hikari on her own merits alone.  As the series goes on Futaba though still easily discouraged at times gradually starts to realise that worrying about something needlessly is useless and that instead of doing so should focus on things that she wants to do and not what society expects them to do. The most prominent trait of Futaba is without a doubt the friendship that she has managed to forge with her fellow classmate and diving club member Hikari. For Futaba who prior to the first season of the series who had very few people that she can call friends meeting and befriending Hikari can be said to have a profound impact on her life. While her friendship with Hikari remains as strong as ever in this season it can be seen that Futaba has become somewhat conscious of the remaining time that she can spend having fun with both Hikari and the members of the dive club and as a result feels an element of fear as a result of it. Paired with this fear of the remaining time left is Futaba’s view on the friendship that she has with Hikari and it can be seen that Futaba worries constantly and somewhat dreads that once the time is up and the two have to leave each other their friendship would also change. <br />
<br />
As a result of this fear, Futaba as the series goes on works hard to improve both her personality and her diving skills showing a determination to not cause Hikari to be upset and be disappointed in her as well as her own desire to be independent and not rely on her for everything. A peculiar and amusing aspect of Futaba’s character that I found to be hilarious is the fact that due to the strong friendship that she has forged with Hikari and how much she values it Futaba is shown to be somewhat protective of Hikari and dislikes it when someone else appears to contest her place as Hikari’s friend. In this state, it can be seen that Futaba tries rather determinedly to protect Hikari a fact that is best shown during the Halloween event. The character of Futaba I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her determination to change herself and improve her diving skills so that she can be with her friends and make many more precious memories with them before the end being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Futaba.  <br />

Ai Ninomiya voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Food wars and Denpa Kyoushi fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is Futaba and Hikari’s senior both in the school and as a member of the diving club. A kind, caring and friendly person by nature Ai while an upperclassman does not treat anyone differently based on their grade and indeed is someone that tries to help her juniors whenever possible. An intelligent and curious young woman Ai while rational and logical most of the time can also be somewhat childish and stubborn at times particularly if she encounters something that she finds amusing. An amusing aspect of her character that’s often used as comic relief is her hot-blooded nature which often causes her to be aggressive towards her younger brother when he disturbs her. However, despite this it can be seen that Ai cares a great deal about her brother. While a calm and cool person by nature Ai is someone that can get flustered quite easily especially in matters related to romance and, in this state, she can get surprisingly nervous which I felt was amusing. While nervous when confronted with issues of romance it can be seen that even in this state Ai can be surprisingly determined and tenacious especially when the other party is someone that has caught her interest and will not easily let go of the situation even when the other party tries to sever the bond between them which is best shown during the Peter arc.  The character of Ai I felt was an interesting one that while providing great comic relief to the series also did a great job of providing some level of calm that restrained some of Hikari’s antics. I also felt that the Peter arc that Ai featured prominently in did a great job of expanding upon her character if only by a little bit. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Oonishi did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ai.  <br />

Animation wise I felt that the locations and settings that the main cast visit in the series was well designed and developed with the ocean environments and the dream settings being both beautiful and impressive in their scenery. The character designs for the series I felt was pretty good and while the main cast from the previous seasons did not really change that much I thought that the designs for the new characters that join in this season such as Peter, Kokoro, his sister Kotori and Hikari’s sister Kodama did a great job of not just giving each character a unique look but also one that matched their personalities and character. The animation for the many marine life and the animation for their dives underwater I felt was also pretty impressive with the former being quite funky. Music wise I felt that the series opening and ending themes which were Crosswalk by Minori Suzuki and Hello, Hello by Maaya Sakamoto I felt were both excellent and complemented the series calming tone pretty well. The series OST I felt also did a great job of highlighting the various moods and feelings that the cast feels as they encounter different situations while bonding with each other. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the members of the main cast all did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Ai Kayano, Eri Suzuki, Saori Oonishi and Ai Yamamoto who portrayed the characters of Futaba, Hikari, Ai and Kokoro respectively deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job at portraying their respective characters. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
In overall Amanchu advance, I felt was an interesting anime and a worthy sequel to the first season of Amanchu with its main strong points being its strong premise, excellent story, heartwarming interactions between its cast, character development and strong voice acting. <br />
<br />
The overall premise of the show which built upon the foundation that the first season started upon still remains the development of the character and personality of Futaba aka Teko as she learns to grow as a person not just in terms of abilities as a diver but also in confidence and personality. While the first season of the series focused on introducing the character of Futaba to the new setting of Shizuoka that she had just moved to by introducing her to not just the sport of diving but also to a host of new friends that include Hikari and her fellow members of the dive club this season instead focuses on the development of Futaba’s personality and character as she becomes aware of the limited time that they have to spend with one another for once they graduate from high school their time together would end. <br />
<br />
The key to this premise comes in two forms the first of which is Futaba’s desire to improve herself and be more independent of others and thus allow her to exist in society without having to rely too much on others. This desire is a result of Futaba’s realization that the time that she spends with Hikari and the members of the dive club while one of the most enjoyable parts of her life up to this point must at some point come to an end and as a result before that happens she must learn to not be too reliant on others and instead be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with them as she goes about her life. The second form is that of memories which is something that goes hand in hand with friendship and the changing realities of life that come as time advances. Within the series, this comes in two forms the first is via Futaba’s desire to treasure her time with Hikari by spending more time with her doing my memorable things such as the Halloween parade and working together during the school festival. The second is through the use of dreams of which Futaba is shown to be quite the professional dreamer which allows Futaba to have many and varied dreams that allow her and Hikari to visit many settings and locations that simply don’t exist in the real world. These dreams while entertaining also fulfilled the purpose of allowing Futaba to experience many magical moments that is simply impossible in the real world. A key struggle that exists for Futaba in this season was the introduction of a rival for Hikari’s affections in the form of the character of Kokoro and I felt that the struggle between them while entertaining and funny also contributed in increasing Futaba’s determination to make more memories with her friends something that was really appreciated. <br />
<br />
In overall Amanchu advance was a series that I really enjoyed that I felt built upon the strong foundations that the first season established. While I felt that the story, premise, character development, character chemistry and voice acting were strong I felt that the introduction of supernatural events such as the Peter story arc which while important for both Ai and Mato was a bit too strange for this season though it was still entertaining to a degree. As a final score, I would say that Amanchu advance easily deserves a final score of 9/10 let down only by the dreams enjoyable as they are felt a tad out of place. <br />

    A story about individual growth and learning the importance of fun.<br />
<br />
If you like relaxed stories with likable characters, go watch the first season and then watch this one too.<br />
<br />
Amanchu! and Amanchu! Advance are amazing. The story is great (except for that whole deal with ghosts and dreams but the rest of the story is still awesome), the art looks great and the music is perfect for the style the anime is aiming towards. The characters are likable and relatable. They push through the same sittuations we all have or will at some point in our lives. The fear of the unknown, the feeling of emptyness

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282021">
        after you&#039;ve had fun, and more. I genuinely enjoyed both this season and the previous one.<br />
<br />
As I think enjoyement is the only score that should ever matter, I give this anime an 9/10.<br />
<br />
Those emoji-like faces are awesome.

    Amane Kozue&#039;s fame for the Aria series has given her a spot in anime and manga culture, a series that is heralded as one of the pinnacle series&#039; for the slice and life genre.  In doing so, the bar for any of her later projects has been set pretty high, with its sister series, Amanchu! fitting a similar bill to what its predecessor was about and was known for in a way that&#039;s not as great as it could&#039;ve been.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Returning back to the town in Amanchu!, our story continues with Teko and Pikari as the two finish part of their first year of high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283836">
        and move into making summer their first summer memories together, hoping and praying that they would be as mystical and memorable as they hope for it to be.<br />
<br />
I mentioned Amanchu&#039;s older sister, Aria, because this season of Amanchu! feels very much like that series.  Specifically, it feels very much like &#039;Aria the Natural&#039;.  This time, the story takes a different turn from the story about a girl in a new town to focus more on actual magic and mystical properties of the world in the setting, something that greatly separated &#039;Aria the Natural&#039; from the rest of its series.  As such, the show takes time to focus less on its characters and more on a new part of the series that feels unnecessary and out of place since the establishment of an arc like this creates a detachment from the rest of the series that didn&#039;t REALLY feel like Amanchu.  Kozue-sensei&#039;s usual sprinkling of mystical aspects to idealize the lives of her characters and make them more exciting is nothing new, but neither is her tendency to go kind of overboard and flop because of it, and that&#039;s really why the story of Amanchu! goes south in this case.<br />
<br />
Aside from that though, the show has a weird tendency to go into &#039;Pikari Worship&#039; mode, where various characters put her up on a pedestal, something that gets boring considering there are several episodes which are devoted entirely to this plot point.  Because of this, Amanchu! Advance never feels like it gets up to the level of quality that was displayed in the first season, as the show strings along multiple types of storytelling that don&#039;t really work when put together.  Like the show is barely even about scuba diving anymore.<br />
<br />
That being said, the show still does have its exemplary moments, displaying the positive themes of how wonderful and magical life can be, as well as the more important message of accepting ones own faults and fighting through adversity for the light at the end of the tunnel.  At the end of the day, Amanchu is still an Amane Kozue work, and while the storytelling this time around is subpar and strange at best, its shining moments really stand out and personally give me a smile on my face considering the worth and usefulness of the messages it conveys.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good themes<br />
-   Storytelling gets a bit...off sometimes<br />
-   Dives into actual magic instead of feeling mystical<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
As far as the main characters go, there&#039;s not really much change.  Both Pikari and Teko don&#039;t feel very different from the previous season, with any changes really only contributing to Teko, though that&#039;s debatable since she already got a major character arc in the first season.  Despite that, their relationship still remains very cute and one of the more positive aspects of the show in that regard.<br />
<br />
On the flipside, a majority of the supporting cast in the first season gets a lot of the season&#039;s focus.  Both Ninomiya twins (mostly Ai) and Kato-sensei get their spot in the limelight, though the actually quality of said attention is debatable.  Regardless, the show does take the time to expand on the characters we already know, which is still a plus considering prior, we didn&#039;t really get to know them or any prior backstory like we got with the show&#039;s main duo.<br />
<br />
As far as new additions go, characters like Kodama and Kokoro can vary in quality with each appearance.  Sometimes they have their shining moments, and other times they&#039;re just sort of there and sometimes act like a hinderance to what&#039;s happening on the screen.  This, coupled with the fact that the show only uses them as supplementary characters ultimately doesn&#039;t give them the benefit of the doubt and makes them worse off than they could&#039;ve been.  The new additions are nice, but they really could&#039;ve been portrayed better.  Especially Kokoro, since it&#039;s only at the very end that I feel they become a tolerable character.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Different character foci<br />
-  New additions feel underwhelming at times<br />
-  Character development/exploration this time feels weird<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I feel like J.C. Staff never puts in the effort to make Amanchu as nice as it could look.  Like the first season, Advance has a very muted color scheme and a quality about it that makes it look much older than it really is.  Indeed Kozue-sensei&#039;s artstyle is reflective in the artstyle, down to the way she draws long dresses (as evident by the similarity of the school outfit to the Undine outfit in Aria) and her weird way of drawing cats, but I just feel like the quality could&#039;ve been so much better than it is.  Hell, Aria got a visual update in Avverine, so why can&#039;t that series&#039;s younger sister get the same treatment?<br />
<br />
That aside, the continued gag of &#039;secondary comedic&#039; faces continues as more amusing expressions continue to infect with Kodama&#039;s now probably being my favorite out of the entire Amanchu cast.  At least that&#039;s consistent, and definitely my favorite aspect of Kozue-sensei&#039;s art.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ More second faces!<br />
-  Art quality still feels underwhelming<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Minori Suzuki&#039;s &quot;Crosswalk&quot; and Maaya Sakamoto&#039;s &quot;Hello, Hello&quot; both come off as very light and gentle songs, with the ED coming off as more energetic with a bit more of an upbeat tempo to offest the more smooth and wave-like feeling that comes with its OP counterpart.<br />
<br />
But really, I feel like the star of the show in terms of sound comes from the show&#039;s BGM, as from the first note, it sets in the slice of life and more lax nature that encapsulates the show as a whole.  This is one of those cases where the show would otherwise feel incomplete without it, and I greatly appreciate having just a simple melody accompany what&#039;s going on in the screen to give the show that extra quality to it.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Decent OP/ED<br />
+ BGM really sets in the show&#039;s tone<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
As much as I am a fan of Amane Kozue&#039;s works, the one problem I find with it is how difficult her series&#039; are to marathon.  Due to their lax nature and how objectively, very few things happen in each episode, I find myself drifting off and paying less and less attention unless there&#039;s a resurgence that occurs which, when it does happen, does bring me back to what&#039;s going on on the screen.<br />
<br />
I compared Advance to &quot;Aria the Natural&quot; because their emphasis on the more magical parts of the world brought the series down due to how out of place they feel.  That, in addition to how droning some episodes can feel catalyzed and drove in the fact that this season really wasn&#039;t all that great.  It has its high points, but comparatively, Teko&#039;s journey towards boosting her self-esteem was a much more worthwhile and satisfying journey that watching an entire arc about Peter Pan.  I still like Amanchu as a series and feel that it doesn&#039;t get the attention it deserves, but at least in this case, there were enough flaws about it for me to validate a less than optimal score than what I would like to give the series.<br />
<br />
That being said, any fans of Amane Kozue should still consider Amanchu.  Sure it isn&#039;t as great as Aria, but there&#039;re things that it does better than Aria (as well as enough references for you to go crazy over), which give it more than enough reason for consideration.  Advance I feel is still the lesser of the two seasons, but it&#039;s still decent enough to warrant a watch.  Just be prepared to see a hump during the middle section of the show.  That was definitely a tough one to get over.

    The slice of life anime about diving and having fun continues with Amanchu Advance<br />
<br />
Advance leaves off where the first season did just with newer characters and Amanchu going off in it&#039;s own little new element it incorporates into all the slice of life moments Teko and the Diving Club goes through.<br />
<br />
So who&#039;s the newer characters, well we get Kodama Kohinata voiced by Aya Suzaki, Pikari&#039;s younger sister, Kokoro Misaki voiced by Ai Yamamoto, a friend Pikari encounters who actually has an infatuation towards Pikari (which makes MUCH more sense later on) and Kotori Misaki voiced by Ai Kakuma, who is essentially the same as Kokoro

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282042">
        cept, towards Teko. Mainly Kokoro gets the most screentime in terms of new characters as Kokoro&#039;s focus towards Pikari is heavily used in this season, Kodama and Kotori gets some but they are pretty much satelitte characters in some sense towards Teko, Kokoro and Pikari but still they have some sense of development as they are around the main characters nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The &quot;new element&quot; of Advance that it implements in this season is Teko&#039;s &quot;daydreaming ability&quot; which somehow gets an entire arc to itself with the &quot;Peter &amp; the school festival arc&quot; involving Ai and Mato of all people. See Teko from the first season daydreamed ALOT and this manifested into her &quot;supernatural power&quot; of imagining lots of things and somehow...the rest of the cast can do this too in the Peter arc and one episode where Teko shows off her power. Now in saying this and this being Amanchu, this isn&#039;t entirely serious (besides Peter&#039;s arc) nor is this a shounen series so take this element with a grain of salt of how it proceeds. Nonetheless Teko&#039;s daydreaming ability does bleed into if things are a dream or in reality at times but for Amanchu, LA doesn&#039;t think it&#039;s something to dwell on it, especially when the daydreaming somehow allows Teko to meet and know someone in both their dreams and somehow Teko knows them in reality by the end of it as well. Again it&#039;s Amanchu so LA can actually let this slide a bit. But nonetheless incorporates this season&#039;s &quot;meetings and partings&quot; especially when involves the new characters and it only solidifies the nature and theming of youth of Advance.<br />
<br />
So with this new element into the mix, yes it means that the focus on diving is diminished BUT diving isn&#039;t all that Amanchu is all about as the core nature of Amanchu is about having fun, making friends be it through supernatural or genki means and the solemn greatness of youth and with it&#039;s new characters in hand, Amanchu Advance doubles it&#039;s efforts in this statement making it even more solid than the first season, heck the &quot;Advance&quot; in the title at least incorporates Teko trying to get her advanced diving license and though that gets talked about and shown at times, it&#039;s more or less the through-line for the plot while it can do it&#039;s supernatural elements and new characters for the bulk of this season.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation once again done by JC Staff, well the animation is pretty much the same as the first season just with the supernatural elements added to it allows for more creativity given especially in it&#039;s backgrounds. The animation is pretty as always from the first season as well as keeping the original character designs is good too. Overall Advance&#039;s animation is the same as the first season just with a bit more flourish due to it&#039;s daydreaming element and it&#039;s still beautiful nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Voice acting is pretty much the same as well but adding in the new characters voice actors, with Aya Suzaki, Ai Yamamoto and Ai Kakuma were nice additions to the anime all things considered, not to mention all of them blended well and had great chemistry with the main cast especially Ai Yamamoto to Eri Suzuki&#039;s Pikari and Ai Kayano&#039;s Teko for the majority of the time. LA wanted to once again put Shizuka Ito as MVP this season but that&#039;s just LA&#039;s bias talking, it&#039;ll go to Ai Yamamoto and Ai Kayano all thing considered with Saori Oonishi as Ai during the Peter arc especially was great on Saori&#039;s part.<br />
<br />
Amanchu Advance is by all means is goes through the same notions as the first season just with Advance going through some new directions and new characters, especially with it&#039;s supernatural elements taking Advance into a newer and interesting direction which actually does make Advance for LA at least much more interesting than the first season, sure the first season had narrative focus on Pikari and Teko&#039;s friendship but Advance...well advanced Pikari and Teko&#039;s friendship not only towards themselves but to the the rest of the cast, new and old, add in the character development of certain characters LA wanted like Mato and some unexpected ones like Ai and Amanchu Advance...literally advanced it&#039;s plot for what a slice of life anime without much tension or character development and solidified it&#039;s core focus of youth and &quot;meetings and partings&quot; that much better.<br />
<br />
Amanchu Advance is one of those anime season where you can both turn off your brain and revel in it&#039;s beautiful yet comedic slice of life moments as well as be wrapped up in Teko&#039;s daydreaming plots...be it lethargic or serious it becomes...

    Following the well-received first season of Amanchu!, J.C Studios have brought along another season that everyone who hadn’t read the manga was expecting much the same content as the previous season. I personally was part of this group, but I had heard of some comments at the announcement of the new season. Safe to say, whilst it does have a lot of the same story elements that made the first season so great, it doesn’t overall feel the same with the inclusion of some more new elements.<br />
<br />
Just a pointer that there won’t be any major spoilers, just some general comments about plot devices or themes,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295826">
        and it does relatively follow off the first season. However, if you have a pretty good recap of the show, there’s nothing crucial that was revealed in the prior season.<br />

~ REVIEW ~<br />
Story: Near to the beginning of the series it starts out much how it ended. Calm feels, combined with a steady journey continuation on the introduction of deep sea diving. I was pleasantly surprised by this as, as mentioned previously, the comments that I read prior to watching this season did infer about some other elements. Admittedly though, there were two parts of this new ‘supernatural’ element that was added into the story. In the beginning it does seem to meld well with the story, not sacrificing the integral theme of the show itself. However, as time goes on it does seem to take a bigger role in the story’s direction, and the overall the tone begins to shift towards something much more dramatic than I was not only not prepared for but also a bit uncomfortable in adjusting to. Alongside this, the theme of diving is eventually brought back near the end and the show seemingly moves back to its roots, but if anything, this feels more disjointed. It began to feel like the whole theme of diving was just forgotten for nearly half the series and was only brought back near the end as a seeming ‘round-off’ to remind the viewer what they were watching for originally. That’s not to say that the story itself wasn’t great, I did enjoy the construction around and the depth of some themes that were discussed (the majority of which I can’t talk about more in depth unfortunately, but overall it felt like there was two stories competing for the major dominance of the narrative that the show was going for.<br />
<br />
Characters: Arguably one of the primary reasons that Amanchu! did so well in its initial season was the characters and their specific development throughout the course of the series. Teko and Pikari were the undeniable stars of the show, making every moment enjoyable and fluffy in every sense. All the major main characters returned for Advance, but there was some much-needed development that I found in several of the main cast that felt under-represented in the first season, as is very common with a lot of slice-of-life anime. The new characters felt like a nice addition to the crew, with none of them necessarily intruding on the prominence of the original cast with no meaningful contribution. Some had lengthy arcs that took place in a tertiary story throughout, whilst some had almost a full episode dedicated to their stories. Again, I won’t spoil who is who, but they did feel like a nice edition with good character designs.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: A slight irk I can have with J.C Studios is that their emphasis on detailed drawings for frames can sacrifice some of the fluidity with the Key-frames. Nonetheless, this series didn’t feel like any sacrifices were made that obviously. The animations felt nice enough and the character outfits chosen, more specifically in one episode I would like to point out, didn’t seem to hinder the animation too much (though I do still wonder about those school uniforms haha). The big standout here for me though would have to be the background art used in the show. Time and time again the feelings of comfy-ness came flooding in every time I saw a new landscape or a new underwater view. The detail that was put into the everyday things in life such as the school itself felt nicely done too. I don’t honestly think it was anything to jump off the walls screaming about or that it made the show, but the Art especially played a significant role in aiding the show’s execution supported by some decent animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: It’s hard to review this as it always seems to depend on the series what I say about it regarding either the sound as a standalone, or the comparison of the sound with the new previous series. I will just clarify here that the critiques themselves are referring to the music and voice acting of this season only, not about the original Amanchu! Most of the original music was used in the second season, however it felt like there was a bigger presence of simple piano instrumentation which I felt did work with some of the more sombre moments of the season, in comparison with the season before which all relatively had a lot of the same music style. Voice acting as always was top notch, with the relationship between Teko and Pikari wholeheartedly believable through a wonderful mesh of adorable yet real dialogue and the delivery of such. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Overall, I would say that I did enjoy this season, don’t get me wrong, however there was something that felt slightly more off compared to the original. I get that there can be the issue of that fans should be able to move along with a development in the show’s theme, and that the changes that take place had already been written in the manga before, but for me as the show had heavily marketed itself as a show about diving in the first season, to take such a radical turn away from it did hinder my enjoyment somewhat. Nonetheless, I did try and take every moment as individually as possible unless it referred to possible character development, and with this I enjoyed these moments a lot more than I initially thought I would.<br />
<br />
~ CONCLUSION ~<br />
To conclude, Amanchu! Advance was a well-made and enjoyable sequel to Amanchu! though despite this enjoyment it couldn’t be ignored that the series does take a sharp change in direction halfway through which could hinder one’s enjoyment of it. However, given the genre that it does switch to, this can be on a person-by-person verdict and some may love it, some may hate it. I would recommend giving it a watch once you’ve caught up on the first season though. <br />
