    (this will include spoilers, also I haven&#039;t written a review before so uh yeah-)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to go into detail but I&#039;m just going to write my thoughts. The characters were very good! we obviously have our happy pink main, a must for all Precure seasons. then we have our beloved smug witch Riko!! I love her so much! I don&#039;t know, something about her is just amazing but I don&#039;t know how to describe it. Mofurun was adorable and fun, most mascots in Precure are annoying brats, but Mofurun was just so nice and pleasant. Kotoha is a caffeinated pure baby and I will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371955">
        protect her with my life. I love how we got to see her grow,,, it was so cute to see Mirai and Riko (along with Mofurun of course) raise her-it was accomplishing in a way to see her turn human.<br />

As a childhood Precure fan, I hold this franchise close to my heart. and there were only a few times it has made me cry, but to say that this shows ending made me cry was an understatement. oh boy. I SOBBED. We got to see our 3 heroines friendship grow and now that it has been ripped apart....Niagara falls were streaming down my eyes. I think I flooded my room. But that part that actually got those big &#039;ole crocodile tears churning out my eyes was when Mirai grew up and she got that stick and tried to bring Kotoha and Riko back... (at least I think that&#039;s what happened I haven&#039;t watched it in a while) But... episode 50....yeah I think we should all agree it should have not existed. SO IF MIRAI, RIKO AND KOTOHA ARE ADULTS WHEN THE KIRA KIRA GIRLS STARTED, CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE LATER COLLAB MOVIES?!-<br />
<br />
(also design-wise, the designs were probably Top 3 in the whole Precure franchise? I really liked them.)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
Ship 10/10 (Mirai x Riko will always be my Precure OTP)<br />
my favourite Precure season so far!!!

The immense love and passion they share is remarkably deep and creates a immersive experience .That makes this a very charming and entertaining media. This shines through on every level  when it comes to their relationship .I cheer for my girls I laugh with them and I cry with them,,Most importantly I&#039;m there with them. It also have interesting side characters that adds a lot to the story!!!<br />

Mahoutsukai Precure: The seventh season I&#039;m watching in the Precure franchise. My experience in watching this season can be summed up like this:<br />
<br />
Miracles do happen- But are you willing to wait for them?<br />
<br />
Mahoutsukai Precure (Referred to as MahoPre from here) is a war of expectations and hope as a viewer, demonstrating Toei&#039;s exotic ability- Or perhaps a vicious curse- of keeping you hanging by a thread over standards they can&#039;t keep up. MahoPre has many shining moments and filled with touchy emotions overall, but if you don&#039;t look at the big

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358921">
        picture, your patience will be pushed to your very limits with the season&#039;s overall quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Get ready because this will be one hell of a rant, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I never thought I&#039;d say this again- MahoPre, just like Star Twinkle 3 years after it, is an example of a story that was never done justice. And in truth, I am utterly heartbroken about it, because as I am about to explain later in this review, the Cures are actually not at fault at all for the story&#039;s downfall, as the story of the Cure team and the mascot this time around was excellent and beautiful.<br />
Unfortunately, let&#039;s talk about the Premise. The premise of the story is that there are two worlds, the magic world and the non-magic world which is Earth. And we have two Cures that come from these two respective worlds, filled with many fascinating differences and special things for our protagonists to learn about. We are pulling a Harry Potter in Precure, exposed to a Hogwarts-like mystical world. The amount of world exploration and story potential from this is insane! And since we know so much about the world we live in, surely the magic world should take more of the spotlight! Yet, that never came to pass, as most of what we see was centered around the magic school. We do see a slice of this other world, but they don&#039;t seem to be as big of a spotlight in comparison to the episodes in the school or Earth.<br />
And then, *sigh*.<br />
The villains. HOLY BEJESUS. TOEI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING.<br />
WHY. LIKE, WHY. This season has the worst villain camp I have EVER seen. In this day and age, throwing a story about people being evil for the sake of evil is... Bland. I mean sure, if you&#039;re Disney then I have nothing to say, but WOW does this season&#039;s villains feel BLAND as all hell. The first half was somewhat better, each villain is sort of different in ways, but as a motivator to push the story forward they are very lackluster.<br />
Oh, what&#039;s that I hear? That&#039;s the end of it, you ask? NOPE! I HAVEN&#039;T EVEN BEGUN WHAT I WANTED TO SAY. They pulled a Futari Wa and made ANOTHER VILLAIN TEAM. And this one is EVEN WORSE. I could complain about The Cataclysm being the absolute most BS antagonists I&#039;ve seen till the sun is dead, so I will save your and my sanity by keeping this as short as possible. <br />
PURELY generic villains. UNBELIEVABLY CHILDISH motives. ABSOLUTELY NO personalities that differentiate them from one another. AND they had to make them as ANNOYING as they can possibly get, with their whole &quot;Mugic is better than magic and magic is garbage so we win and you can die in Deusmast&#039;s reign&quot; trashtalk. MY GOD, they were so garbage that the final battle of this season was only FIVE MINUTES long. YEAH. That just shows even Toei knew they messed up. IF YOU&#039;RE GOING TO PUT ANOTHER VILLAIN TEAM, DON&#039;T F*CKING MAKE THEM THE STUPIDEST AND MOST HORRIBLY WRITTEN VILLAINS I&#039;VE SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry, my fellow viewer. I&#039;m just really annoyed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Art: 10/10<br />
So after that horrendous rant, let me move on to something I can praise about this season, shall we?<br />
The animation and art style for MahoPre was very enchanting and pleasant to look at, fitting the theme of the season. Besides all the pretty backgrounds and fight scenes and the concept of multiple transformation styles, this season basks in the full power of implications and details with its animation. Examples of this include the love confession by Mayumi in episode 34 and the final farewell between Mirai and Riko in episode 49. Perfect in this department.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music: 10/10<br />
Also exceptional in this department. There are lots of soundtracks that I see as exclusive to this season and you&#039;d know it&#039;s this season when you hear it because you won&#039;t hear as many magical music pieces as you do in MahoPre.<br />
Two of my favorite and personal best songs in the Precure franchise, Sparkling Vows and Two Wishes, come from this season. And can I just say, when Two Wishes played in episode 49, I want to cry. T~T<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
This Character review is probably one of the most infuriating reviews I have ever done on this website. Not because of the Cures, though.<br />
First! Mirai.<br />
Now, I&#039;m sure I wasn&#039;t the only one who thought that Mirai in terms of her voicing was super underrated. No, I&#039;m not just talking about how superb the voice acting was for Mirai in several moments, but I want to take this chance to vent out my disappointment of her being overshadowed by characters who, like her, was voiced by the amazing Takahashi Rie, during the season&#039;s running. Because wow, Mirai is good. Just watch episode 49.<br />
Of course, I have to look at the story. This season&#039;s development is a bit different for our Pink because the show wanted to heavily emphasize Mirai and Riko&#039;s friendship, but on her own Mirai is also very much likable, bright and a bundle of fun by her own right. Mirai can get clumsy at times but she&#039;s also very strong and treasures her friendships greatly.<br />
For Riko, since she didn&#039;t come from the non-magic world, we got to see more development on her individual character than we did for Mirai. Over the course of the season, Riko learns more about what it truly means to acheive her dream as an excellent magician. She learns the value of friendship, trust and support. When paired with someone so different from her as Mirai, she helped Mirai to bring out the best of herself as Mirai did the same for Riko herself. MahoPre&#039;s approach to Mirai and Riko&#039;s friendship is excellent, and makes the final farewell all the more heartbreaking.<br />
And then, we have a fairy Cure and a mascot.<br />
Kotoha aka Ha-Chan has taken the place as my third favourite Cure in history, and though she only debuted in the disasterous second half, her beginnings as Kotoha in the 20s was pleasant and joyous to sit through. As if Mirai and Riko&#039;s friendship wasn&#039;t enough, Ha-chan joins in the fun and turns this team into an outright Precure family, and it&#039;s just friggin adorable how that turned out.<br />
Mofurun also took the cake as one of if not the best mascot/Precure ally I have seen so far, highlighted in her friendship with Mirai both in the series and the movie of the season. She received more profound development than many other mascot I&#039;ve seen so far, and that&#039;s saying quite a lot since this is my 7th season- And of course, the quality doesn&#039;t disappoint.<br />
You can see- I have nothing against the Cures and Mofurun, they were unbelievable in all of their stories and had the best team dynamics of all the teams I&#039;ve seen. But lord and behold, of course the villains had to come and destroy everything. Not only is the development on that horrible, it is so bad that I would honestly wish the manga had been the legitimate story of MahoPre. The villains do NOTHING but drag down the story pace. No, not so much for the Dark Magicians (First half), but the Cataclysm ones. Although I have to give props to Oruba and of course Chikurun for trying to be decent, the latter being much better at it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
2020 was quite an awkward year for me and Precure, since I&#039;ve been expanding on other anime. MahoPre got caught in the crossfire easily with many of its problems. Poorly written villains, really unstable quality of episodes, pacing slower than it had to be, and of course, it&#039;s been so many seasons and I&#039;m used to all the Precure flair now.<br />
But if I had to say whether I enjoyed the series, of course I did, I&#039;ve seen much worse (You can tell by looking at my anime list.) As I said, this season&#039;s team is friggin adorable together, and I can&#039;t ask for more than just 3 Cures and a teddy bear and sometimes a bee going through a cool double life of saving the world. The season had so many cute moments, quite a bit of emotional wrecks, and arguably the greatest season finale which made me had to wait like over a week to write this review so I have no bias.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.6/10<br />
Mahoutsukai Precure has, in some ways, been a letdown. But the great moments of the season make the gaps worth it- You&#039;ll just have to be patient for them. So if you&#039;re not the kind to wait for the good content, this season might not be for you, but the story of the Cures is one to smile at nonetheless.<br />
<br />
<br />
But don&#039;t take my word for it- Do find out what others thought about the season!

    Overall: 7.5<br />
<br />
With the most impressive, in-depth world building of all the Precure shows, you&#039;d think it would go to great places... except that it mostly does not.<br />
<br />
Story: 7.5<br />
<br />
You could divide this show into two halves - the first half, which is well thought out and consistent, and the latter half, which goes from unique and interesting to a messy abomination and back within a few episodes. While there is some filler, most of it does actually contribute to the character&#039;s relationships, and aren&#039;t totally useless for a change.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7.5<br />
<br />
Not the most unique set in the Precure universe, nor the most developed. But they&#039;re not irritatingly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305835">
        exaggerated, either, and it&#039;s their relationships as a group that really makes the show watchable. In fact, the side characters are all surprisingly well fleshed out and involved, given they&#039;re barely ever on screen.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
There&#039;s three different magical outfits for the duo, which are all wonderfully unique and befitting of their characters. The uniform and clothing designs are adorable, and definitely worthy of a cosplay or two. There&#039;s some gorgeously drawn and unique scenery, and a few cool angles from Mofurun - the teddy bear- &#039;s perspective. Even the CGI dancing is visually interesting, though by no means a masterpiece. It&#039;s perhaps the most consistent of all the Precure series in terms of visual style. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
<br />
The ED&#039;s are... annoying. They&#039;re exactly what you&#039;d expect from an off-beat children&#039;s anime. The OP is fast-past and interesting, but ultimately nothing special. <br />
<br />

    Story: Mirai a middle school girl who still carries her teddy bear accidentally finds a witch named Riko. A magical miracle happens when both of them hold their hands together as they wear same kind of linkle stone and there are 12 more which they must gather.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
At first i got a feel of looking &#039;harry potter series 1&quot; with only female students ( especially train station as converging point to magical world station, snail train etc). Introduction of Principal was good. For me the only character that was good in it is Maffurin ( the teddy bear) For about 20 episodes, the series was unpredictable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240573">
        and creative. We wanted to see it what happens next with curiosity. There is so much  adventure that  can be feast to your eyes . <br />
<br />
Art: Too good. Beautiful scenery is shown in the anime. For instance there were lot of flower garden, mythical pegasus and fairy world.  <br />
<br />
Sound: Perfect sound tracks.<br />
<br />
But the most boring part is &quot;transformation&quot; scenes. It is unbearable to see a single transformation once in this kind of anime but here there are 2 levels of transformations which occupied lot of time in an episode. Villains are just dummy.  There is stupidity in confusing the viewers by trying to introduce &quot;dark magic&quot; is different from  mugic and mugic lead to dark magic concepts. It may have confused you here. But if you see the entire series. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  I enjoyed only the first 20 episodes ( later 6 episodes or so) as the next episodes seem to be dragging the series unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
Overall: This shoujo anime is just for little kids to whom we want to teach the value of friendship. But for grown ups, when Mirai constantly says about Friendship in obsessive manner, it irritates. Her cries to see Riko at the End seemed unnatural and gave me the feeling of shoujo ai and awkward. I was not able to comprehend here longing for Riko alone when there is Haa-chan too. For me that spoiled my  interest in the series.

    While Pretty Cure as a franchise is pretty notorious for being very clingy to its formula, you can&#039;t deny that the shows always try to do something new with each new show, so no two seasons of Pretty Cure are exactly alike. This also means that every Pretty Cure season has their own parts that they excel at and parts that they don&#039;t. I fell out of Pretty Cure after Go Princess due to other obligations and...other things, but that&#039;s neither here nor there. But recently I&#039;ve gone on a bit of a kick involving stories about young witches using their magic to solve problems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385878">
        and help people, what with watching shows like The Worst Witch (The Netflix season), Flying Witch (A very good anime, BTW!), and reading books such as Little Witch by Anna Elizabeth Bennett, the original Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service novel and, a particular favorite that just came out, Eva Evergreen: Semi Magical Witch (Definitely give that one a read!). Since I&#039;ve been trying to get back into Pretty Cure thanks to Healin Good turning out really great, I thought I&#039;d give Mahou Tsukai a gander...and man, I really wish I could rate this series higher than I did. It has a lot of potential, but I really didn&#039;t enjoy this one. In all honesty, Mahou Tsukai is one of the most frustrating Precure shows I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
The story is pretty much a magical girl version of Harry Potter. One night, Mirai Asahina sees a witch girl, Riko, flying around on a broom. She manages to find her and the two become friends, but Riko is on the hunt for something called a Linkle Stone Emerald. She&#039;s not the only one, as a slew of evil villains try to get their hands on the gem as well, intent on making sure Riko and Mirai don&#039;t get in their way. But a pair of magic necklaces they have allow them to transform into the mythical superhero witches called Pretty Cure, whose job it is to defeat these enemies. Their appearance doesn&#039;t go unnoticed, as the headmaster of the witch school Riko goes to takes a particular interest in them, supporting them all he can while doing his own research on just what these enemies want with the Emerald. Along the way, Mirai enrolls into remedial classes at the magic academy, Riko learns to get better at magic...since she&#039;s actually rather lousy at it, and on top of that, the two girls find themselves raising a magical fairy baby they name Haa-chan. Mirai&#039;s life is sure to get more exciting!<br />
<br />
...And I only wish the series were that way as well. I don&#039;t want to be a killjoy, so as I mentioned before, every Pretty Cure season has things they&#039;re good at and things that they&#039;re not. For Mahou Tsukai, it&#039;s the worldbuilding and setting, mainly in regards to the magical world that Mirai and Riko are tasked to protect. You know how most Pretty Cure shows establish that the fairy companions come from a magical land, but the shows themselves rarely, if ever, show said magical land or give the audience reasons why we should care about it? Well, Mahou Tsukai rectifies that issue tenfold, as the first few episodes of the series takes place in the world where Riko hails from, and even after that, the story never forgets that it&#039;s there, often showing the heroines going back there on occasion or interacting with the other denizens, making it feel much more alive than most. This series, from the few Pretty Cure shows I&#039;ve seen so far, actually makes an effort to flesh out its setting and explain why things are the way they are...most of the time. It also helps that Mahou Tsukai has no shortage of fun ideas that would definitely make the magical world fun from a kid&#039;s point of view. Parts of the world only having one season only, snail trains, flowers that make fireworks, ice dragons sighing on clementines to freeze them for consumption, a magical tree that produces magic wands when a child is born, and so on. The real world setting is nothing to write home about, but Toei really put their all into actually fleshing out the setting this time around, giving the audience reasons to actually care about it!<br />
<br />
I only wish Toei put that same amount of effort into...well, everything else. I mean, the animation is fine, but it&#039;s typical of magical girl shows at this point: Bright and sparkly, with some off model scenes every now and again, with transformation scenes that go on for too long (Cure Felice&#039;s especially!), and 3D CGI for the plastic toys they&#039;re trying to promote. They also decided to ditch the CGI attacks that were prominent in Go Princess, so it gets points there. Since this season started off with a new composer and decided not to use the person who made the music for Doki Doki, Happiness Charge, and Go Princess, any music that&#039;s made is completely new this time around, thankfully. But it has been several years since I&#039;ve seen Go Princess, and I don&#039;t know if this season actually reused music or not. One thing about this season&#039;s OST does stand out though: In Mahou Tsukai, the girls use magical gemstones to transform, and depending on one of four stones they use, they gain new outfits and Cure powers (IMHO the Ruby form is the best version. I honestly wish that was their default outfit as it has the best animation and designs out of all of them), and each transformation is given their own variation of the theme that&#039;s used for it. I&#039;ll give Yuuki Hayashi props for actually making the four transformation scenes distinct from one another, so kudos to him for trying. Not gonna lie though, the opening and ending songs are a massive downgrade from Go Princess.<br />
<br />
Not gonna lie though, the characters are one of the weakest aspects of the show, and for several reasons: Mirai is your typical bland, peppy, go-getter girl who doesn&#039;t have much personality and depth other than &quot;gets excited over everything&quot; and even though she&#039;s a normal kid with no experience with magic whatsoever, she manages to master learning magic after just a few lessons at magic school. Riko fares slightly better, as she actually has to struggle and overcome her flaws to achieve what she wants to do and learn more about herself. Out of all of them, she&#039;s the best...but the episodes where she&#039;s allowed to show her stuff and become a more three-dimensional character are few and far between, and after her initial first arc, she doesn&#039;t get to do much after that. In all honesty, many of the side characters, such as Emily, Kay, and Jun, were more interesting than the main trio. I wanted to see more of those three and see episodes wholly dedicated to them. The villains are the absolute worst, being little more than Saturday morning cartoon villains with nothing in the way of personality or depth, and the thing is, rather than actually develop them, the show just kills them off in the first half of the series, completely replacing them with brand new villains right afterward while also giving them little to no purpose or depth whatsoever! Seriously, Healin Good, while it has similar issues for its villains, at the very least managed to stay consistent with them and gave them their required amount of screentime! And I&#039;m not the only one who thinks this either. Isao Murayama, one of the producers for Mahou Tsukai, has stated in an interview that he came to regret how he wrote the villains, so when he went on to work on Star Twinkle Pretty Cure three years later, he made an effort to give the villains in that better, deeper character writing. Good on him for making an effort to learn from his mistakes.<br />
<br />
But the character I have the biggest issue with is Haa-chan, particularly after she becomes a Cure. When she&#039;s a fairy baby, she&#039;s perfectly fine! But after she became a Cure, the creators made her not only overpowered as hell, but absolutely annoying too! Haa-chan is able to achieve feats that no witch in the magic world can do, when she&#039;s told to do or not do something she absolutely refuses to listen (Like using magic even though the others tell her not to do so, and even when she seemingly learns her lesson, she immediately goes back on it two scenes later), she&#039;s constantly shilled by all the other characters, it tries to present some of her more flawed traits at the expense of them actually being flaws, and worst of all, the creators feel the need to have her take away focus from other characters, even in said characters&#039; focus episodes! One example being the episode where Riko reunites with her father but is frustrated by the fact that he focuses more on his work than her. For an episode that was touted as a Riko-centric episode, she doesn&#039;t get so much as ten whole lines out of it, and she doesn&#039;t get to do anything throughout the episode other than stew in her frustration and let everybody else do the talking. When Riko&#039;s father is feeling bad about himself and realizing what he did, is Riko the one to actually communicate with him? Nope, let&#039;s just shoehorn in Haa-chan and have her give the cheesy, moralistic rousing speech to him while completely ignoring Riko whatsoever! See what I mean about Haa-chan actively taking time away from characters who could actually benefit from it? I think the series would have been so much better had Haa-chan stayed as a fairy baby. At least in that form she was quiet and didn&#039;t shoehorn herself into every character&#039;s business and cause needless trouble for it! I wanted to throw my computer at the wall every time Haa-chan hogged the spotlight.<br />
<br />
Lastly, it feels like the show doesn&#039;t really know what to do with itself. There are times when the show puts in some effort to flesh out its story and put on a grander narrative, but a good chunk of the episodes are pointless filler that amount to nothing, one of them being the one where the girls get their power-up item...and the way they acquire it is one of the absolute dumbest things the show has ever done. Do they earn it through training, through getting stronger, through overcoming an adversary, coming to terms with their flaws, or growing as people? Nope, they get it by way of a bizarre magical dream that has absolutely no bearing on the storyline whatsoever! At heart, the anime is a lighthearted magical adventure, which is fine, but the two halves of the show feel like two different series, what with how they shaft old villains in favor of new ones. I feel like this show would have been more enjoyable had it just focused on the fantasy world and made more of an effort to flesh out its characters and make them feel like three-dimensional individuals. In all honesty, the anime&#039;s biggest strength is that it doesn&#039;t ask anything from the viewer. You can just watch it, turn your brain off, and not have to think about anything difficult...but you can achieve that same effect by watching paint dry.<br />
<br />
(Oh, by the way, don&#039;t watch episode 50. Episode 49 provides a MUCH more concrete finale and is a perfect stopping point. Episode 50 just shoehorns in the KiraKira Precure A La Mode main character for the sake of a pre-series cameo that accomplishes nothing)<br />
<br />
Not one of the better Pretty Cure seasons, but it&#039;s a nice, lighthearted romp you can use to babysit your daughter/little sister/nice or whatever.

    Mahoutsukai Precure! is the 13th Precure season. Instead of the girls being legendary warriors, they&#039;re legendary witches so there&#039;s a major shift in setting because there&#039;s two worlds: Earth and the magical universe and these two places are the focus throughout the show. <br />
<br />
Visuals: I really liked them. They&#039;re colorful, detailed and pretty. <br />
<br />
Audio: <br />
1) I hated the soundtrack <br />
2) every Precure season (with one exception so far) casts the most popular and experienced seiyuus so I always have very high expectations on this regard. However and for the 1st time, those were exceeded. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story and characters: <br />
1) Overall, it doesn&#039;t feel Precure at all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415993">
        and it kept breaking immersion for me<br />
2) very slow paced <br />
3) the main characters go from 0 chemistry between them to suddenly giving off some very intense yuri/gay vibes. Homosexuality doesn&#039;t bother me at all (I&#039;m bisexual myself and I believe representation is very important) but it was super weird the sudden shift in vibe. <br />
4) SPOILER PLEASE DON&#039;T READ IF YOU DON&#039;T WANT TO GET THE ENDING SPOILED FOR YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED: it was nice seeing the characters all grown up but the time lapse of a bunch of years where they don&#039;t see each other at all felt completely unnecessary <br />
<br />
<br />
Because I just couldn&#039;t get into the plot or the characters, it&#039;s a 4/10 for me. <br />
