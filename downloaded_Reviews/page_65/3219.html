    If your requirements for enjoying an anime are fantastical brightly colored settings, perfectly formed and ideal bodies, and over the top comedy chop full of nosebleeds and sparkly heart shaped eyes; then Aoi Hana is not for you.  If your only interest in yuri storylines is girl on girl macking and fan service; then Aoi Hana is not for you.  Aoi Hana has none of these things. (Well besides the girl on girl macking)<br />
<br />
What Aoi Hana attempts to portray is a thoughtful and serious story about a group of teenage girls as they learn about first love and themselves.  The main focuses

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18828">
        are the girls Fumi and Akira (affectionately called Aa-chan).   Both were close friends when they were very young but in the years they had forgotten about each other since Fumi&#039;s family had moved away.  The story begins with both girls starting as freshmen at new high schools, Fumi at Matsuoka High and Akira at the nearby and prestigious Fujigaya.  The girls are fatefully reunited through a series of chance meetings and the new friends they make at school.<br />
<br />
There isn’t anything flashy about this series, much like its lead Fumi, its soft and delicate.  The story is much more diverse and real than your standard romance series.  While the themes are mostly yuri, it also feels like a slice of life, a comedy, and a heterosexual romance.  Aoi Hana is unique in that it is one of the few series I have seen that has dealt with sexuality in a serious manner.  Usually yuri romance is set in an unrealistic world where everyone is completely gay without question and in which there are no social consequences.  Here the cast struggles to deal with their crushes or unrequited loves for both male and female characters.  Things never play out quite the way you might expect them too either.  I also felt the story was very mature and classy.  There isn’t any exploitive fan service or sexual content added for mere titillation.  Though there is intimacy and mature themes everything is handled so tastefully that it really stays true to the themes of the anime.<br />
<br />
The only thing that really keeps this series from getting a perfect score from me is the open ending.  At this time the manga is still publishing so the only way to have a true ending is to go with an original one.  J.C. Staff didn’t do that with this and chose to leave it open.  This was probably the right call, even though it is a bit annoying as a viewer.  What Aoi Hana really needs is a sequel and hopefully we might get that someday.  Though it’s not a bad ending even if this does end up being all that’s made, but it still left me wishing for much more.<br />
<br />
As a character, Fumi ultimately proved to be the most interesting and deep.  She is a shy, weepy girl who will cry seemingly over everything and nothing.  Fumi further stands out as being the only really completely gay character in the show.  While many of the characters deal with relationship angst involving both sexes, Fumi is at least confident in her own identity.  She is perhaps both the most cowardly yet also the bravest character, having the courage to come out of the closet to her best friend but yet not able to speak her true mind to even her lover.  Yet she evolves over the story and while the essence of what makes her such a sweet and likeable character remains to the end, the inner strength she discovers by the end made her so much fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Akira is the kind of character that is likeable from the start.  She’s the kind of person every girl wants as a friend.  In the story she is the anchor that keeps the rest of the cast together.  She is in the middle of seemingly every plot line though she doesn’t really have a story of her own.  Though she is technically just as much of a main character as Fumi is, I felt that she didn’t get the kind of development she deserved.  We get many subtle and perhaps not that subtle hints on her love interests but sadly there is never any payoff.<br />
<br />
Yasuko Sugimoto is exactly the kind of girl I hate in anime.  She is the tomboyish, athletic, outwardly emotionless, and inexplicably popular character type.  I have never understood why this types are so desired by girls in these kinds of shows.  Someone like this certainly wouldn’t have been this popular in my high school.  But a friend as told me this is not the case in an all girls environment.  The simple fact of the matter is that I thoroughly detested her.  Though I have to admit that despite me not liking her, she ended up being an interesting character and indispensable to Fumi&#039;s growth.<br />
<br />
The last of the main cast would be Kyouko Ikumi.  She becomes Akira&#039;s first friend upon her starting her life at Fujigaya High.  While Ikumi is a sympathetic character in a lot of ways given the way she is often treated by Yasuko, she also has a lot of creepy stalker elements.  Personality wise she’s a lot like Fumi in that she is very emotional and prone to tears.  Though she also appears to be outwardly much stronger emotionally then Fumi, on the inside she really is a bit of a pathetic person.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is also strong.  While the cast does seem to get a bit large by the end, the anime does a good job of picking out the most important things to show and leaving the fluff behind.  Unusually for a yuri series there are a few male love interests.  Though for the most part all of these men are not given much screen time, their impact is felt very strongly and their presence is extremely important to why certain characters are the way they are.<br />
<br />
Most will probably look at Aoi Hana&#039;s artwork and think it is plain looking.  But they would be missing the point I think.  The art and animation is perfect for what this anime is trying to accomplish.  The colors are soft and reserved and add to the feeling of realism this show has.  There aren’t any impossibly short miniskirts or mountainous breasts and all the characters look and feel like regular people which only further adds to the sense of realism.<br />
<br />
The music further adds to the atmosphere.  Both the OP/EN songs are soft and pleasant and thoroughly enjoyable.  The voice acting is stellar.  The main cast is voiced almost entirely by new faces who I felt did a great job.  There are many familiar veteran seiyuu almost the supporting cast which I thought was an interesting reversal.<br />
<br />
For fans of yuri, Aoi Hana is a title that must not be missed.  I think it’s a bold and original production in an industry full of the same tired old themes and sequels.  Anyone else who is interested in a serious romance and coming of age story should definitely give this a try.<br />

    I said it before and I&#039;ll say it again: there are just few things on this planet that can be as fabulous tier as I am. Aoi Hana is one kind of anime that comes dangerously close. (NB: close. Nothing is my tier as yet).<br />
<br />
This anime has the distinction of NOT being a disgusting fanservice yuri anime. It is pretty good drama and isn&#039;t about hot chicks snogging one another or worse, not snogging and just drinking tea all the time. Don&#039;t get me wrong, this is no &quot;snore, huh?, wtf, I can&#039;t even spell &#039;soeur&#039;-fest&quot; like Maria-sama ga Miteru nor are the girls candy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19160">
        coloured whores like in Strawberry Panic. <br />
<br />
No, Aoi Hana shows you pretty much how unfabulous it is to be a gay-girl teenager who is so deep in the closet that even the Boogieman is starting to feel claustrophobic.<br />
<br />
So the story follows this plain chick Fumi whose big distinctions are her height and her ability to cry at the drop of the hat. Apparently everyone wants a piece of her (reasonably so, she&#039;s a nice gal), so she gets into all sorts of lesbian hijinks with her cousin and this older chick in school. <br />
<br />
We follow the exploits of Fumi as she goes pimpin&#039; across Kamakura. It really says something when she can just mosey on up to a new school and bag the hottest guy in school. Although the hottest guy is just a butch girl. Yasuko is kind of a more overt pimp, because she&#039;s basically got all the girls wanting to get some, especially this hot little number called Kyoko. Who is sadly being chased by this guy (a real guy, btw) who has no idea the girl he&#039;s engaged to wants to dine on fine rug gourmet rather than sausage.  <br />
<br />
Now, be warned of the trollin&#039;--this is no Kannazuki no Miko or anything. One thing you loser fans will have a problem with is the lack of explicitness in this anime. Where are da boobs!? If she&#039;s scamming on other girls, why aren&#039;t we seeing her panties?? I thought this was going to be about fingersex? Oops, this anime has class, taste and dignity. So be warned, none of that in Aoi Hana.<br />
<br />
What we got is a sweet and fabulous little story. The art only really misses getting a 10 because there wasn&#039;t enough pink or glitter or pink glitter in it. There were dudes in this but they were pretty much average looking like everyone else. Everyone looks pretty normal. Other than that, it&#039;s pretty down to earth and real. The sound is pretty good too, but as for Akira&#039;s voice, I wouldn&#039;t want to take that to bed, if you know what I mean. She sounds like a little kid, which I guess is the effect they wanted because Akira is pretty much like the most childish character in the show (though she&#039;s not immature). I don&#039;t even know what I mean. Who&#039;d want to take Akira to bed? Nobody! <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s another pretty cool aspect of this show. Akira, the second main character, isn&#039;t automatically paired off with chick-master Fumi like ALL THOSE OTHER YURI shows where the BFFs suddenly go gay for one another. That is surprisingly very cool of this anime.<br />
<br />
For being real: 10 fabs out 10.<br />
Lesbians: 9 fabs out of 10.<br />
Lack of fairy dust: 1 unfab, but since this isn&#039;t that kind of show, I guess I can let it slide. <br />
<br />
All in all, watch this show, since I have deemed it fabulous.

    It&#039;s true enough when they say that you never forget your first love. There are those lucky enough that the memory is nothing more than that, just a hazy recollection, a fond vagueness. For some, first loves are pangs, barely perceptible; the heart has forgotten how to beat to that rhythm. And then for some, a first love is as soft and fragile as a little flower.<br />
<br />
This is the wealth presented in Aoi Hana, an anime adaptation of Shimura Takako&#039;s utterly genius manga series. The development of the manga is akin to watching a book read itself, learning and discovering things, and then reflecting that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112315">
        in its own progress. The anime does not get to reach this stage, as unfortunately it did not get the audience or attention it needed for another season. But to pass this series up is to deny yourself a great piece of literature in motion.<br />
<br />
Manjoume Fumi moves back to her first hometown after ten years. Can you even call it her hometown? Wouldn&#039;t the place where she spent most of her life be considered &quot;home&quot;? It seems relative. Home for her is where her heart resides, where her mind wanders, where her bones grow. And it seems that that place has always been Kamakura. At home, there is Okudaira Akira, a best friend and first love.<br />
<br />
Aoi Hana covers a few volumes of the manga series; the anime manages to capture the early stirrings of many things to come. It tries to come full circle right where some may say the manga is actually &quot;beginning&quot;. Does it work? It really does.<br />
<br />
With J.C. Staff&#039;s beautiful, clean artwork and a gentle acoustic-driven score, we are taken into the quiet town of Kamakura where even quieter dramas unfold. The minute troubles of everyday life tick away during the days, and the big problems end up as landmark moments in lives as they tend to do. The anime primarily focuses on the rekindled friendship between Fumi and Akira, and it extends to the interactions that these two have with others, including relatives, friends and lovers. Fumi goes to school at Matsuoka while Akira attends Fujigaya; the story unfolds giving us humorous, sweet, bitter moments of teenage lives. <br />
<br />
Friendship seems natural and easy. It helps when Fumi is nothing but a sweet, gentle, though firmly resolved young woman. It&#039;s easy to love Akira&#039;s earnest soul. Here we have a series that suspends our expectations for the protagonists. Do they fall in love? Is this even about their love? In every way, yes. It&#039;s always been. Is there romance between them? That&#039;s for you to decide, as Aoi Hana respects Fumi and Akira&#039;s friendship and overall relationship enough to develop naturally, be it as best friends or as something other.<br />
<br />
Throughout the anime, we meet other people whose presence give this show the warmth and life. This is a world populated with good people. That is one of the most important things to note about the characters in this series. Whereas other dramas will proceed to insert the most despicable villains, Aoi Hana has truly decent folk. Their intentions may be selfish, awful, manipulative and downright hurtful at times, and yet we can&#039;t ever fail to recognise that their hearts are good. Their flaws, as painful as they may be to themselves and others, can&#039;t ever take that away. <br />
<br />
Two of the most complicated souls in this anime are Sugimoto Yasuko and Ikumi Kyouko. Sugimoto is a charming upperclassman that Fumi eventually dates; Kyouko is Akira&#039;s classmate. While it seems that they come into the story because of our protagonists, their tales are strong enough on their own. There is a parallel running between the two and the Wuthering Heights play which they perform; everything is embers, burning low, hiding somewhere in between polite smiles or bratty scowls. Who are these two girls who understand one another better than anyone else? What is this hopeless love that surrounds them both? Unrequited and mocked, one-sided and unfortunate. And yet there is love.<br />
<br />
That is not to say these two overshadow Fumi and Akira in terms of the best characters that the anime offers. Everyone is rendered with respect and careful attention. Even the comic trio, Yassan, Pon-chan and Mogi, are downright lovable. Kyouko&#039;s cousin Kou is another individual who appears for brief segments in the series, but his small smiles tell us so much; he accepts his losses with dignity and strong shoulders.<br />
<br />
And then we always go back to Fumi and Akira. Fumi, in spite of her crybaby ways, shows promise that someday she&#039;ll become a person whose tears show strength, not weakness. Akira&#039;s understanding of the people around her reveal that life is just budding for this girl; she has not yet begun maturing and in a way, this makes her the perfect ear and observer for messy situations. There is just a fierce magnificence about her as she takes care of things or sees how they work. If maturity means masking everything, then perhaps Akira&#039;s way of life should be given some consideration. <br />
<br />
By the end of Aoi Hana, what you will have witnessed is one of the greatest contributions to yuri as well as the genres of slice of life and drama. It has intelligent characters with great depth, a solid story with strong development and not to mention, there&#039;s that rather pretty art framing everything. The concern at the end of it is not who gets together or what situations are resolved. At the end of it, we&#039;re left to chase after the meaning of a blue flower.<br />
<br />
Sometimes love isn&#039;t enough. Other times it&#039;s more than you ever expect. Sometimes it disappoints us. And then there are moments when it doesn&#039;t let us down. But for now, it&#039;s a quiet little beat, drumming to a once-forgotten, now-remembered rhythm. Something carried in the wind, caught and preserved between the pages of an old photo album.

    Aoi Hana...<br />
<br />
If I am asked to describe it in 3 words, I would say: <br />
1. Gentle 2. Kind 3. Friendship<br />
<br />
~Story~ <br />
It is about friendship, which lasts. And, which overcomes all the difficulties. What if your bestfriend tells you that she is in love? In love with a girl?... Does it change your friendship? If yes, how? If not, why? It is great to have a friend, who will support you no matter what. And I would like to highlight that the main theme of this anime is friendship between two girls. And hatsukoi (first love), which they experience is beautiful, but the most important is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17497">
        to see how they support each other. Real friendship between young women is gorgeous and very rare. <br />
<br />
~Sound~<br />
Opening song is very gentle and soft. A singer has a unique voice, which 100% fits the story. Ending theme is a nice slow song, which is adorable. Music in this anime is great and enjoyable!  <br />
<br />
~Characters~<br />
Gentle and shy Fumi-chan and happy and energetic A-chan are like ice and fire. It may seem a bit cliche, as there are many these kind of characters  in anime. But in Aoi hana there is no antagonist, the &quot;bad&quot; person, every character is great in it&#039;s own unique way.<br />
<br />
~Art~<br />
At first character faces seemed a bit strange to me, but after few episodes, this doesn&#039;t matter anymore. A background image does suffer, as it is not detailed enought. But maybe it was done to capture viewers attention on the story and not on the image details.<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~<br />
This anime features classics. Firstly, Wuthering Heights, and if you read this book and love it, you would enjoy this series a lot. As Erica Friedman, the president of Yuricon and ALC Publishing said: &quot;Aoi Hana could easily be compared to a Jane Austen story&quot;, and he feels that the story is not &quot;a melodrama or a parody&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m enjoying this series a lot. I have never thought that shoujo ai genre would interest me, however I was wrong. It is a gorgeous story, which should be admired by people, who love slice-of-life anime.

     Love is love, no matter whether you are a guy who is in love with a girl, a guy who is in love with another guy, or a girl who is in love with another girl. <br />
<br />
And I think that&#039;s the important message that an anime like Aoi Hana tries to show us: no matter what your sexuality or even who you fall in love with, nothing is more sweet and lovely than falling in love and being in love.<br />
<br />
It may seem a bit much giving an anime a score of 10 so easily, but let me justify: an anime like Aoi Hana makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18973">
        it easy for you to just fall in love with it and its brilliance. Honestly, I can say this is one of the few romance anime I have seen that qualifies so thoroughly for the term &quot;masterpiece&quot; simply because it is so earnest, sweet, romantic, dramatic and does not fall into the typical cliches and tropes you find for other romances. Yes, even though it&#039;s an anime about girls who love other girls. The portrayal of it in this anime is something beautiful and not something to be used for a fetish or for fanservice.<br />
<br />
Or should I say, about a girl, really. Yes, Aoi Hana is mainly about a girl. And this girl is Fumi Manjoume. Fumi is a tall, shy bespectacled girl whose pivotal moment in her life lies in her move back to her old home town. She does not seem happy about this since she&#039;ll be leaving her cousin (someone the anime hints that &quot;something more&quot; was happening between them) and starting life anew. But things don&#039;t look down for long as Fumi reunites with her childhood best friend, the childish Akira Okudaira, a short, spunky, excitable girl. <br />
<br />
Aoi Hana&#039;s strong point in its story is the focus on the truly beautiful friendship that these two girls share. It deals with serious issues like coming out of the closet which is something I hear is not quite common in anime at all. Heck, it&#039;s not common in real life for some people! The moments that Fumi and Akira confide in one another, whatever insecurities and pains and secrets, are all heartwarming moments. I cannot think of another anime that portrays female friendship so well. Most of the time, girls are pitted against one another like Roman Gladiators, but in Aoi Hana, the real nature of a good, strong friendship are examined. <br />
<br />
Fumi neither dumps nor forgets about Akira when she gets a girlfriend; her best friend remains an important part of her life. Akira never brushes Fumi off when she needs a shoulder to cry on (and trust me, Fumi cries a lot!), but she always bravely and strongly holds her handkerchief and hand out to comfort her best friend. I think anime girls can learn a lesson in friendship from this show. <br />
<br />
Aoi Hana has its ups and downs like any drama but the nice thing about it is that they never shove things in the viewers&#039; faces and nothing is forced. The story and characters develop smoothly WITHOUT the usual screaming, backstabbing, crocodile tears and dramatic music. <br />
<br />
Speaking of music, the Aoi Hana BGM is pretty delicate and soft. Truly lovely to listen to! The art also is top notch. Some moments are just astounding. The characters&#039; facial reactions are the best things though. You can see exact moments when someone&#039;s mood changes just from a shift in their eyes or maybe a slight frown on the face. The anime has this penchant to put focus on intimacy too. You get a lot of detail in the scenes, like a character playing with another character&#039;s hair, or holding their hand. I think the hair playing and hand holding shows so much more intimacy than any amount of kisses, boob-groping, or nakedness could ever do. <br />
<br />
Overall, for a romance, this is probably the best thing I ever saw simply because it plays out so realistically. Sure, it may not be the star lights and fireworks kind of romance or the Casablanca romance. It&#039;s more like the girl next door kind of romance. You grow into it. And for being such an excellent anime in its simple nature, Aoi Hana proves to be a success as far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
I strongly, strongly recommend it. Even if you&#039;re not a lesbian or even if you&#039;re not a girl, the themes of love and friendship are all too clear and not confined to just the context of the story. It has a universal and lovely meaning that we can all take something from. We can learn to be more receptive to our friends and their secrets, we can learn how to deal with a break up, and we can learn how live goes on no matter what heart breaks we might face. <br />
<br />
Aoi Hana is a spectacular anime, go out and watch it now if you&#039;re tired of all the conventional and unreal romances!

    i felt like i got robbed watching this series. overall i give it a 3/10 and here&#039;s why:<br />
<br />
SPOILERS AHEAD...<br />
<br />
1). Fumi x Akira NEVER HAPPENED AT ALL. I fell in love with the opening song, especially the parts where Fumi x Akira are dancing with the flowers &amp; both are bare-skin. It was so dazzling and mesmerizing to watch them dance inside that flower garden &amp; flower tornado. And when Akira drops those flowers gently on Fumi&#039;s cheeks...the way they looked at each other (especially how Akira looked at Fumi)... it was so mature and beautiful to watch that it made me wish I could look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124531">
        at someone the same way and have someone return those feelings. You can easily tell that they&#039;re really in love.<br />
<br />
This feeling is what I got from having watched the opening of Episode 1. Around episode 5, I could tell that Fumi x Akira doesn&#039;t even look like it will happen because the series kept focusing too much on the other characters. At episode 8, my heart sank even further because there were only 3 episodes left and there&#039;s no way a deep bond can be formed with Fumi x Akira in that time span.<br />
&amp; in the final minutes of episode 11, we see a glimpse of Fumi x Akira starting to form but then the series just ends right there. I was left saddened and angry that I couldn&#039;t get to see the deep bond that was portrayed between the Fumi x Akira in the opening.<br />

2). Felt like Yasuko x Kyouko were the main characters in this series. It was obvious from the opening that Fumi x Yasuko would end so I didn&#039;t care much for Yasuko so much. But it seemed like Yasuko and Kyouko were shown more often than the 2 main leads Fumi and Akira. I started caring more about how Kyouko can&#039;t receive the love of Yasuko. &amp; Yasuko who can&#039;t receive the love of her teacher. Yasuko x Kyouko weren&#039;t even the &#039;main main&#039; characters. Because of this, Fumi x Akira never got to fully take form.<br />
<br />
3. The pace was agonizingly slow. It took forever for something significant to happen. It was like watching baseball, hockey or soccer. Each of those games last like 3-4 hours and you have to wait like 1 hour before a goal is scored. sometimes the games end in a draw of 0-0, which means like u wasted 4 hours watching a &#039;no-score-nothing-happened&#039; game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think about around episode 7, where Yasuko introduces Fumi to her family, was when I finally got hooked on the show because Yasuko reveals that she&#039;s going out with Fumi; thus declaring her sexual orientation. It was sad to finally get attached to the series starting around the 2nd half. but i knew coming into the series that the genre revolved around Yuri, drama and romance and that the opening was good. Those 4 aspects are what helped me endure.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
well, all in all, i did enjoy the series somewhat despite the reasons stated above. I wanted to know the bond of Fumi x Akira that was shown in the opening. I could never feel the closeness of those 2 anywhere in the episodes. &amp; the fact that this didn&#039;t happen at all in the series... that just left me empty inside.

    This anime was definitely not made for everyone, including myself. I was expecting a love story, and I got one. It wasn&#039;t bad, and honestly was a great portrayal of young love and figuring yourself out. However, the two characters we expect to get together at the end of the show (which is HEAVILY alluded to in the intro and throughout the show) do not end up getting together.<br />
<br />
Overall this anime was boring. It was realistic, the animation was cute and not anything like other girl love animes, but jeez I&#039;m kinda mad I wasted time on this one. It is a very subtle anime.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329476">
        The characters were boring, the story was boring, every girl was going for this one male teacher?? Like there was never any explanation about that OR Manjome&#039;s weird love for her cousin. Strange show that many people seem to love.

    So I just finished this anime and I can say that I did not regret it. <br />
<br />
Story 7/10 : The story about highschool girls reconnecting, finding love, getting hurt and finding thier way back. The characters have their own personality and their own love problems which made the story intense (personally). By the end of the series, you begin to wonder and fill yourself with many questions..which also made me love this story even more then I did, (reading the manga as of now -) I couldn&#039;t help but wonder what will happin to Ikimu? or Sugimoto? what of A-chan and Fumi? Then I began

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179613">
        to wonder, &quot;Do I remember my first love?&quot;, which is rare for animes to have me wonder that (ha!). Overall, the story is great and just all around put together wonderfully. <br />
<br />
Characters 8/10: I loved the character development in this Anime; Especially Fumi and A-Chan.  Fumi being a shy, soft spoken girl and to have a live personality spilled from A-chan, it calls for a perfect pair of friends. Their backstory was innocent and pure, and I really digged it. Ikumi was another favorite, a one-sided love personaility is a good way to relate (her to myself) and I could comprehend the pain of it all.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10: The art was simple and detailed. It&#039;s not like &quot;2020 graphics&quot;, to me it just seemed like a story drawn right out of the book (harhar). It was elegent, in between &quot;too-much&quot; and &quot;too-little&quot;. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8 out of 10. <br />
If you expect a girl on girl fan service, with a lot of cute (besides fumi fufu) and exaggerated rainbows, this wont be what you are looking for. It&#039;s a well made story and it just beings the slice of life out of you. The mystery of how it started and how it ends is one thing I love about animes, leaving my mind to wonder on my own personal thoughts.

    I began reading the manga long ago, but for some reason I still don&#039;t know, I stopped. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Aoi Hana is a very special anime: good animation, colors, soundtrack. The storyline is really sensitive and beautiful. I think it shows very much the difficulty we have with our own emotions and also how amazing is the first love thing, even though you get to get distant from the person you fell in love with. It&#039;s a mark on our lifes. <br />
<br />
I recommend it.

    Aoi Hana, from the first episode till the very end, was pretty much of a tender ride, a light-hearted anime about love.<br />
<br />
I always find Yuri is the purest kind of love. And this gerne is not strange to the anime world coz many shows have tried to portray it in many different ways possible. But i must say in the Yuri world, Aoi Hana is a unique one, not because it&#039;s so weird or unusual but it&#039;s very serious and realitics. A series that portrayed what young girls would worry or think when it comes to love, with jealouscy, with worries, with demanding, with misunderstanding,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192386">
        etc... <br />
<br />
The anime itself is easy to watch, with bright colors and beautiful drawings. I really had no problem marathon through the show. It also has good op and ed.<br />
<br />
&quot; No one can forget their first love&quot; - that&#039;s what i learn from sweet blue flower.<br />

    Story: Are you sick and tired of watching the same generic love story all the time? Are you sick of watching yuri that&#039;s just basically there to show smut? Well, this anime is nothing like that whatever. You see that it&#039;s a romance in the genre section, but this is more than that. It&#039;s a real coming of age story about two girls trying to find their way through high school and what it really means to love someone. You have two best friends, Fumi and Akira, who reunite after ten years of separation and find out that they are going to different all girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215826">
        schools. Akira is your energetic one who tries her very best to protect those she cares about. Then, you have Fumi, the cry baby who is also very shy but has her love of books. You&#039;d think that these two are just your another set of tropes, but they&#039;re actually more complex than you think (which I&#039;ll explain in the characters section in more depth). I can&#039;t really say anything more or else I&#039;d spoil the rest of the series for you, but I promise that it&#039;s a complete must watch. Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Art: The art style is very sketchy, but at the same time, it reflects the story of two high school girls trying to make through their first year of high school. Also, with some of the jokes they lay out, nothing seems out of place for a simple, romantic story. With the muted colors, it makes you feel like you&#039;re in your cozy hometown and you know it from top to bottom. There is drama, but it&#039;s so subtle that you might not even notice it at first glance, but that&#039;s the magic of the animation style used here. The character designs are perfect, and I find this anime to be a work of art. Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound: Though the soundtrack is very simple, I really have to give credit to the people who wrote the opening and ending themes. If you really want to let the audience know that this is a coming of age story, the opening should reflect that and the ending should remind you of that. That&#039;s exactly what those songs do hear, and if you are a fan of slow music, I highly recommend that you find these songs and download them to your playlist. They&#039;re beautiful, settling, and they&#039;re also good for when you&#039;re having trouble falling asleep. Though, I will be biased and say that the opening has to be one of the best openings I have ever listened to in my entire life. Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Character: As I mentioned a little bit in the story portion of the review, the last things the characters are in this anime are flat and stereotypical. If anything, I can actually relate to more than one character from this entire series. My only issue is that if the story is between Fumi and Akira, how come we don&#039;t see Akira that often. I guess we can also argue that this is Fumi&#039;s coming of age rather than Akira, but that doesn&#039;t stop the characters from playing major roles. Fumi is shy and she does cry at most points, but you know why she does, and you see her evolve from a shy girl into a woman who makes the right decisions in order to take care of herself instead of others doing it for her. That is pretty amazing if you ask me. Then, you also have Ikumi and Sugimoto-sempai who are also enjoyable to watch. You get to know them as one thing, but later on, you know they have secrets to hide as well. It&#039;s to my belief that every character has a coming of age in this story, which makes it all the better. Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I can tell you that this anime is a tear fest. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing to you, the anime is still lovable and it makes you want more after each episode ends. There&#039;s never a dull moment, I promise. Score: 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: (IS THERE MORE? I WANT A SEASON 2!) So you can basically tell how much I love this anime, and for good reason, too. Perfect score for me!

    aoi hana surprised me with more mature themes than you&#039;d normally find in a wlw (woman loving woman) romance, and strong characters with interesting, relatable dilemmas. despite loving the genre, it&#039;s not often that you watch a yuri anime where characters not only acknowledge their coming of age journey into their sexuality, but also acknowledge that coming out of the closet is not an easy thing to do, and approach this topic with maturity. aoi hana managed to defy my expectations and actually didn&#039;t end up being the best friends to lovers yuri cliche that i originally thought it would be, while also respecting the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331097">
        characters and not allowing anything to feel fetishy or overly sexual.<br />
<br />
spoiler warning, ofc:<br />
<br />
i think that one of the reasons i really loved this show is because the plot was so different than i thought it would be. rather than just simply being a romance, aoi hana is an anime about coming into your sexuality, and tackles this topic both from the perspective of Fumi, a young lesbian that has only experienced unrequited loves with various women in her life, and the girl that she has a crush on and eventually dates for much of the series, Sugimoto. Sugimoto and Fumi are both interesting, well-developed queer characters, and their relationship- despite it not working out at the end- teaches them both a great deal about themselves. Sugimoto is a masculine-presenting bisexual woman, which was honestly very refreshing to see, especially as the phrases &quot;bisexuality&quot;, &quot;lesbian&quot;, and &quot;coming out&quot; are actually used throughout the show, making it more rooted in reality. fumi&#039;s coming out scene with akira, as well as akira&#039;s response to this, was one of my favorite moments in the show, and it makes me happy that other lgbt people have a show like this with realistic gay characters to relate to. <br />
<br />
wanted to rate this an 8, but bumped it down to a 7 because despite akira being one of the two main characters, she barely gets any character development, much less a character arc. i found her a bit more likable than fumi (although that scene at the end where fumi tells sugimoto straight up what a bitch she&#039;s being was so satisfying to watch), but because she never really got the screen time to feel like she had her own conflicts going on, it feels more like she just revolves around Fumi. even at the end when fumi realizes that akira was the first woman she ever loved, it felt more like a sidenote thrown in at the end, and honestly, i think i prefer them as being childhood friends that love and support one another. maybe if they had gotten more than 11 episodes to really flesh everything out, it wouldn&#039;t have been just thrown in. i wouldn&#039;t say that i hated the ending by any stretch though, if im being honest it just made me want to read the manga for more.<br />
<br />
overall, definitely recommend if you&#039;re LGBT and want to watch a yuri romance that doesn&#039;t just feel like it takes place in Yuritown, JP. the character dilemmas feel rooted in reality, and this makes it especially relatable if you identify as queer yourself.

<br />
Welcome to Robert&#039;s Too Late Review! Today we&#039;re tackling the masterpiece that is Aoi Hana. I am a fan of *good* yuri anime, possibly to the point of preferring what is considered class-S in Japanese culture, that of friends who are less lovers, and more &#039;soul sisters&#039;. Having said that, my first two experiences with yuri-ish anime was Maria-sama ga Miteru, a firm class-S, and Strawberry Panic, an over the top full on yuri. Neither of them prepared me for the beauty of this anime. It is an experience not to be missed! I&#039;ll let you guess now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287795">
        if Aoi Hana made the RTLR wall of fame.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The story is a rollercoaster of emotions, taking us on a journey through childhood friendships, to contemporary same sex relationships, to the heartache of loneliness and ending on the power of love to heal. Powerful themes run throughout, such as how/when/to whom to first approach when coming out, selfishness, pain, and even selflessness. I cannot express the story in detail without spoilers, but I know I was going moment from moment laughing, crying, and even crying happy tears. <br />
<br />
Art: 7 <br />
I don&#039;t care for the art style. It is considered &#039;clean&#039; and &#039;utilitarian elegant&#039; by some, but I find the look to just appear a bit on the cheap side. I know I&#039;m spoiled by other, more &#039;artsy&#039; anime, but the simple animation did not work for me.  It got the job done, but didn&#039;t rock my world. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The sound of Fumi&#039;s quiet sobbing make me tear up even now as I write this. The voices are well done, and the score is appropriately hauntingly beautiful. <br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
This is what makes the show! Fumi is such a beautifully constructed character, and her overall story arc in the series is stunning. Every bit of pain, awkwardness, and embarrassment Fumi went through, I felt like I was right there with her. Every feeling of joy and moment of happiness was the same way. Akira is suitably pushy, and plays well as a foil for Fumi&#039;s inherent sadness. Sugimoto&#039;s development is fitting, if frustrating. It is the character work that makes this anime soar!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I was initially turned off by the simple, plain animation but I stuck it through and found love. By the first train ride scene, I was already feeling like I knew Fumi personally. Akira&#039;s brashness also fit so well within the story. The way the story really focuses on finding one&#039;s own inner strength is classic yet timeless and beautifully done. <br />
<br />
I really cannot lavish more praise on this anime than it deserves. This holds especially true if you are like me, and Fumi as well, shy, and struggled (or are still struggling, as applies to me at times) to find your voice, and feel like you are whispering into a hurricane. Fumi is almost eerie in that I felt like, even as an adult male that she was so much like me. As I said, I wasn&#039;t a real big fan of the art, but Fumi is too beautiful to pass up, and she makes the wall, which I&#039;m sure is no surprise at this point! It is truly a titan among yuri anime, and even among the stars in *all* anime in general. Check it out, you won&#039;t regret it!

    I enjoyed this series. Some may not like it as it is slow paced; there’s nothing over the top or exaggerated about it. It’s simply about the lives of different girls as they develop in maturity and discover what infatuation, first love, and being in love is.<br />
<br />
The story is bittersweet, dealing with the comforts of friendship and the pain of unrequited love. There is not an excessive amount of drama or romance in the plotline. There are aspects of those genres, but to a subtle extent and it is romantic and dramatic without being overtly so.<br />
<br />
There is no heavy story here. Rather, Aoihana is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24661">
        very character driven series. The whole series is based on character growth, particularly through Fumi. Prior to watching the series, I was expecting more graduated love interest between the two main characters. But the series focuses more on the friendship bond of the characters, which is actually pretty interesting. It overrides the stereotype of childhood friends meeting again and falling in love with each other. Although at the same time, it doesn&#039;t override that stereotype exactly, but I won&#039;t say why.<br />
<br />
The problem I had with the plot flow of the series is that I was expecting more to happen that didn’t. I guess the series could have been longer, because many things aren’t really concluded in the end.<br />
<br />
I liked the animation. It was simple in its backgrounds, fluid in motion, and watercolor-esque in the colors. The character designs were aesthetically pleasing. The cast is not all girls, with some guys playing rather prominent roles, and there seems to be only one defined lesbian established in the series at all.<br />
<br />
Aoihana is set apart from many other shoujo-ai/yuri series in which it takes the aspect of girls falling in love with other girls in a more tasteful way, rather than the over the top situations you normally would find. The interactions are more realistic than often in other shoujo-ai shows.  Some of the main characters are well explored, though some we could get more depth on. I liked Fumi and Akira’s relationship, and I liked their characters well enough. I thought Yasuko was a bit annoying and manipulative.<br />
<br />
The music was nice. I liked the opening a lot, the song was very gentle sounding. I had no problem with the voice acting.<br />
<br />
This anime was actually more friendship based than romance based, because it revolves around the strong bond of Akira and Fumi. The depiction of their platonic, loving closeness is quite well done.<br />
<br />
All in all, the subtleness of this series is what makes it work. It doesn’t leave you racing to watch the next episode in eager anticipation, but it’s not trying to. It was executed quite well. This series may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but if you’re looking for a calm slice of life about what it means to fall in love and to start stepping closer to adulthood,  then you should try Aoihana.

    Aoi Hana is bittersweet but at the same time one of the most realistic representations of real world relationships that I&#039;ve come across.<br />
Went in for the yuri, stayed for the story.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re not going into Aoi Hana for fuzzy feelings or a wild ride through a wacky world of interesting events. You&#039;re going in for realistic relationships, believable characters, and the crushing reality of what romance really is and how fleeting that feeling can be. (Including the struggle of being able to &quot;come out of the closet&quot; to your friends and family).<br />
<br />
Subtle animation and a muted color palette capture the tone and real-world feel of Aoi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308761">
        Hana. Much like reality, much of what you look at isn&#039;t meant to paint a pretty picture. It&#039;s functional and it gets that message across.<br />
<br />
These characters are well written and despite there being the typical shy girl with glasses and typical short haired girl that every other girl fawns over, their personalities and development more than make up for the archetypes. There are some characters that get extremely strong developments and there are some that stay static, this helps to emphasize the changes that happen to the developed characters and by the end gives an idea of how these changes will affect those around them.<br />
<br />
Aoi Hana is effectively one of the few pieces of media that I can wholeheartedly say is a masterpiece. It features one of the most moving character arcs without being monumental that I&#039;ve had the pleasure of seeing, and it&#039;s portrayal of real world relationships goes without saying to be one of the most genuinely beautiful snapshots of human romance, friendship, and compassion that I&#039;ve seen.

    As a teen, there were several shōjo-ai series that I sought out, since I was a young queer person, looking for something that I could relate to: &quot;Sasameki Koto,&quot; &quot;Saki,&quot; &quot;Shōjo Kakumei Utena,&quot; &quot;Kannazuki no Miko,&quot; and &quot;Aoi Hana&quot; were the primary ones — unfortunately, I didn&#039;t have the pleasure of watching &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; until I was in my mid-twenties! Out of the entire list, &quot;Aoi Hana&quot; was the production that I really resonated with; especially, when I was first coming to terms with the idea of being attracted to the same sex. Because of that, I have re-watched the anime a few times,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368322">
        as well as completed the manga series! &quot;Aoi Hana&quot; is replete with sweet sentimentality and is delicate towards sensitive topics; a truly beautiful story of love&#039;s gradual blossoming! <br />
<br />
⚠️ This review contains spoilers for the anime and manga ⚠️<br />
<br />
—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
The story starts off pulling out your heartstrings, like a big clump of hair, as Fumi experiences heartache for the first time. Her older, female cousin (Chizu Hanashiro) had initiated a sexual relationship with her and shortly afterwards, Fumi learns that Chizu is immediately getting married off, to a man that she&#039;s never met before. Fumi has to internalize her feelings, while her family celebrates, and she&#039;s a shy and tender-hearted girl, so she lets the emotions smolder, rather come to terms with them directly. That last sentence is important, because there&#039;s a big development, with that, towards the end of the series.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally, Fumi has an encounter with her childhood friend, Akira Okudaira, and doesn&#039;t recognize her because, when they were kids, Akira was much taller than she was; but now, they&#039;re on complete opposite ends of the spectrum! I found this subversion of physical attributes interesting, because, in this case: the tall girl is the crybaby and the shorter girl is her protector, when it&#039;s usually the other way around! Upon attending Matsuoka Girl&#039;s High School and joining the drama club, Fumi finds herself falling in love with her &quot;lady prince&quot; upperclassman, Yasuko Sugimoto!<br />
<br />
Yasuko then rudely rejects another underclassman, Kyōko Ikumi, and asks Fumi out. Fumi lets herself get closer to Yasuko, not realizing that she&#039;s only manipulating her, to gain the attention of a male teacher that had spurned her, a year prior. Yasuko, then, of course breaks Fumi&#039;s heart and acts like a complete jerk — she then tries to get back together with Fumi and mend their relationship, and there&#039;s this really cathartic moment where the meek, kind-hearted Fumi stands up for herself and says that she&#039;s not going to let Yasuko play games with her heart anymore. The anime then leaves off with a romantic scene, with Fumi and her childhood friend, Akira, starting to develop feelings for each other — holding hands in the snow, reminiscing about their childhood.<br />
<br />
The manga goes further with their relationship, of course; Akira&#039;s realization that she&#039;s in love with Fumi is really poignant, because she had always assumed that she didn&#039;t have a crush on anyone and, that she was, essentially, asexual. So, when she realizes that she&#039;s besotted with her best friend, Fumi, it&#039;s difficult for her to come to terms with. This is really relatable, if you&#039;ve ever been a queer teenager, because you&#039;re taught that girls like boys; so, you can often delude yourself into thinking that you aren&#039;t infatuated with one of your female friends, when you really are!<br />
<br />
The way that Fumi is taken advantage of, is always something that screams of a lesbian adolescence. Many girls will experiment with bisexuality, but not commit to a queer relationship — like with Yasuko, so it&#039;s more difficult than with a heterosexual relationship to find someone who&#039;s completely being &quot;real&quot; about it. This was so relatable, because I have been in that position before!<br />
<br />
I thought that it was clever to cast Yasuko as Heathcliff (&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;) in the school play, because although in the ACTUAL story Heathcliff is cruel because a life full of oppression and abuse, but Yasuko is still manipulative and selfish in a similar way! This series perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to awkwardly flower onto the small stem of same-sex relationships, it&#039;s probably much more common now, but when I was younger, being gay was mostly an experimentation type of thing. At the end of the manga, Fumi and Akira are able to find a soulmate in one another, and live happily ever after! It&#039;s a really beautiful story — it&#039;s kind of shocking how little people talk about this anime!<br />

Character Designs<br />
* Aldnoah.Zero —series ✅<br />
* Battery<br />
<br />
Commentary: I am ashamed to say that I haven&#039;t explored more of Ms. Shimura&#039;s bibliography, from what I&#039;ve read, her works are pretty solid. I prefer the manga and anime for &quot;Aoi Hana&quot; over &quot;Hōrō Musuko&quot; (&quot;Wandering Son&quot;) — while they both have really good characters, the plot and transition between perspectives is more sloppy in &quot;Wandering Son&quot;! The manga for &quot;Aoi Hana&quot; has a little bit of this, but since there aren&#039;t as many characters, it&#039;s less of a headache to keep up with the revolving scenes. Her designs are splendid, though! That was part of the reason that I kept watching Aldnoah.Zero, despite the questionable plot points! Very talented artist and story-teller!<br />
<br />
Kenichi Kasai (director), notable works:<br />
* Amanchu! ✅<br />
* Bakuman. —series ✅<br />
* Chōyaku Hyakuninisshu: Uta Koi. ✅<br />
* Cooking Papa<br />
* Hachimitsu to Clover —series ✅<br />
* KimiKiss Pure Rouge<br />
* Love Stage!! ✅<br />

* PuriGorota: Uchū no Yūjō Daibōken<br />
* Senjūshi<br />
* Wagamama☆Fairy Mirumo de Pon!<br />
<br />
Commentary: Man, Mr. Kasai really likes those vivid color palettes! His work on slice-of-life is really atmospheric, in series like &quot;Amanchu!&quot; and &quot;Hachimitsu to Clover&quot; — there&#039;s a really beautiful, nostalgic feeling to them... that is accentuated by the subdued, pastel scenery! From what I&#039;ve seen, &quot;Aoi Hana&quot; and &quot;Hachimitsu to Clover&quot; are the top must-watch series, directed by Mr. Kasai. In the case of &quot;Bakuman,&quot; while the anime adaptation wasn&#039;t terrible, you can&#039;t beat Takeshi Obata&#039;s art style. I think the only anime-adaptation that really pulled it off was &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot;!<br />
<br />
※Speaking of &quot;Bakuman&quot;, the live-action film had a great musical track in it. Check out &quot;Shin Takarajima&quot; (新宝島) by a band that goes by the name of Sakanaction! They are incredible!<br />
<br />
Good Seiyū Work = ✅<br />
<br />
Really Enjoyed the Seiyū&#039;s Performance = ✅ ✅<br />
<br />
One of Luna&#039;s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅ ✅ ✅<br />
<br />
Ai Takabe as Fumi Manjōme, notable roles:<br />
* Maiko, Hōrō Musuko ✅<br />
* Agiri Goshiki, Kill Me Baby<br />
* SP, Sacred Seven<br />
<br />
Commentary: Ms. Takabe was a really talented actress in the industry, both her roles as Fumi Manjōme (&quot;Aoi Hana&quot;) and Maiko (&quot;Hōrō Musuko&quot;) are really compelling. Unfortunately, she got arrested for cocaine possession and was thus, ousted from the industry in 2015, the latest news on Ai Takabe — is the news about her recent marriage, but despite her beautiful performances as bishōjo characters, it doesn&#039;t look like she&#039;ll be coming back to anime voice acting. Wonderful performance as Fumi, though!<br />
<br />
Yuko Gibu as Akira Okudaira, notable roles:<br />
* Akiwo Suzuka, Koi Koi 7<br />
* Haruka, Tabi Machi Late Show<br />
* Maon Sakurada, Tamayura ✅<br />
* Hikari Onozuka, Yama no Susume ✅ ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: I really liked Ms. Gibu as Hikari Onozuka in the second season of &quot;Yama no Susume&quot; — as Aoi&#039;s co-worker at the bakery, she&#039;s very sassy, but cute... in a tsundere way! As Akira, she&#039;s a very clear-hearted and pure girl. Later in the manga, I thought she was one of the most well-written characters, as she experiences something that a lot of LGBTQ+ teens go through — the horrors of self-actualization, thinking that you&#039;re asexual or that you haven&#039;t found the right guy, and then you come face-to-face with the fact that you might actually be in love with one of your closest friends! Amazing job!<br />
<br />
Chiemi Ishimatsu as Yasuko Sugimoto, notable roles:<br />
* Junsa (&quot;Officer Jenny&quot;), Pokémon XY<br />
<br />
Commentary: It&#039;s kind of strange that Ms. Ishimatsu is both Yasuko Sugimoto (&quot;Aoi Hana&quot;) and Officer Jenny (&quot;Pokémon XY&quot;), and then everything else is just a full discography of hardcore hentai roles. Well, I suppose she is kind of like the &quot;evil&quot; bisexual character in &quot;Aoi Hana&quot;! Ms. Ishimatsu does a great job of making her come off as a noncommittal jerk. But, the character also has a couple of other main attributes, that are vying for dominance: she&#039;s both a cunning, yet charismatic heartthrob and a mixed-up adolescent. Later, it is implied that the charisma is mostly a mask, and then the plot reveals that her emotional stability is in shambles if she isn&#039;t the center of attention; despite her desperate attempts to appear mature, aloof, and cool. Although, Yasuko Sugimoto is really unlikable, she&#039;s also a really, really well-written character! Stunning performance!<br />

Commentary: Ms. Horie does a really magnificent job of making Kyōko Ikumi both cute and sympathetic, as her character is actively pining after Yasuko Sugimoto, the &quot;lady prince&quot; of the group. Her dynamic with Yasuko is really interesting, too, since Kyōko is forced into an arranged marriage with a boy she doesn&#039;t like; while, Yasuko was dumped by a male teacher, and thus, uses other people as a hurtle, to get over him. Kyōko comes off as unsympathetic at first, because she&#039;s obsessed with Yasuko and even cuts her hair to look more like her, but then it is revealed that Yasuko has a tendency to lead other people on and Kyōko is actually very dedicated and loyal, and not as obsessive as one might think.<br />
<br />
Conclusively, Aoi Hana is a simple, teenage romance story... but the refinement and care taken into the small character nuances is something to write home about. The manga and anime are the best shōjo-ai stories that I&#039;ve experienced, out of ※all of the ones that I&#039;ve hungrily devoured over the years: it has a special place in my heart. The anime for &quot;Aoi Hana&quot; gets a 7/10, while the manga is a solid 8/10!<br />
<br />
※Another really good shōjo-ai manga is &quot;Lonely Wolf, Lonely Sheep&quot; — Fūka Mizutani.

    The opening credits nearly turned me off watching this anime.  We had a lot of beautiful shots of friendship and love, then the two of them naked; it threw off the tone.  I know it wasn&#039;t explicit nakedness, not erotic, nothing more than an expression of how the two of them can be completely vulnerable with each other, but still, it threw me off.<br />
<br />
This was an absolutely beautiful anime, going through the ups and downs of trying to find your way around love and relationships with others.  I truly wish there was more.  Through all of the various likes and loves,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315967">
        watching the love between the two friends, watching them realize the love they had for each other, was truly breathtaking.

    i&#039;d like to document some stream of consciousness thoughts here: partly to paint the  emotional landscape that it brought out of me, partly to use my limited filmy/animationy knowledge to try and expound upon why i feel like i feel, and to touch on aspects of shimura&#039;s style i&#039;m starting to pick up on after wandering son and this.<br />
	<br />
sleepy rhythms of a sleepy town.<br />
breathes and sleeps in mellow. words and a deafening lack of words that echo for episodes after they&#039;re said. fickle loves that bloom, shrivel, detonate. loves that echo for episodes. loves that compete with others within you and in the hearts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314926">
        of others. loves that emerge from dark corners you never knew existed within you. loves that refuse to float away. it&#039;s a show about friendship, about not letting go of old pals who are there for you through whatever may come, and about how important it is to just talk it out about whatever&#039;s weighing you down and take a deep breath. it&#039;s a gaze out the window on a rainy day kind of show. collapse on your bed after a hard day kind of show. a strum the blues kind of show. the kind of endlessly endearing, vulnerable coming of age story that you can&#039;t help but donate your heart to.<br />
<br />
the most underrated thing about takako shimura is her bedrooms. places of refuge that tell you everything about her characters without saying a word. it&#039;s a mirror to the soul of its owner- with intentional, thought out detail. it goes without saying that this helps bring out the colour in the stars of this series- the flawed, jealous, repressed, recovering, earnest, performatively mature girls (and occasionally, boys) trying to find happiness. fumi is quickly becoming a favourite (with sugimoto as a close second), but wherever you look you find people just trying their best to get through hard situations, people making bad decisions for good ends.<br />
<br />
i want to talk about chizu for a bit- fumi&#039;s cousin and first partner, with whom she, on and off, held a one-sided sexual relationship- as we are told in the first episode. as a big flcl fan something i hugely admired in that show is how tasuku, main character naota&#039;s older brother, leaves such an indelible stain on the show and the story with the tiniest of screentime and effectively no dialogue on their own. chizu&#039;s husband is never even shown. all we get is a scene with a half-hearted sorry, a birthday cake (there&#039;s a certain other scene that&#039;s also interesting to talk about on this subject too, but that&#039;s more of a spoil). it&#039;s like yui from eva all over again. the look on fumi&#039;s face as she walks in and see&#039;s the cake in the room in the first episode? the look of sheer and absolute horror? it&#039;s incredible. chizu echoes through most of fumi&#039;s actions and the asymmetrical feelings awkwardly skirted around in that relationship is paralleled repeatedly in virtually all of the other key relationships. i think it&#039;s masterful writing to realise such a character in such little space.   <br />
<br />
i finally want to touch on what i&#039;m slowly discovering to be a favourite tool of shimura&#039;s to expand upon character dynamics- plays, and acting. characters&#039; relationships parallel each other and teach us more about each individual, what they learn, and how they progress and what others need to do themselves, but [play name redacted to avoid spoils] helps illuminate certain main characters&#039; perspectives on characters that mimic their own, helping to understand their mindset and where they are as a person better. whereas acting in wandering son was a pocket of safety in your gender identity in &#039;gender-bender plays&#039;, acting in aoi hana is about naturalised parallels and mirroring character arcs to illuminate character development without using anno-esque arthouse direction that really wouldn&#039;t fit the chill vibes of this sleepy little town by the ocean and the mundane stories it hides. i think it shows a lot of flexibility and development as a writer.<br />
<br />
the only things i can think of to fault is that the OP turns otherwise intricate character work on akira and fumi&#039;s childhood-best-friendship/maybe romance into explicit, unsubtle homoeroticism from the very start by having them lovingly gaze at eachothers&#039; naked bodies, even though akira&#039;s sexuality is at best a mystery even after the anime ends and 99% of the series&#039; efforts at romantic development focuses on sugumoto, that the character designs don&#039;t have enough colour diversity so can occasionally look a little monotone and flat, that the animation isn&#039;t outstanding (but it doesn&#039;t need to be), and that the relaxed, languid pacing might not be to everyone&#039;s taste. it&#039;s not bombastic or fast, but it doesn&#039;t need to be.<br />
<br />
aoi hana is delicate and tender moments of humanity incarnate, beating, throbbing, pumping, laughing, crying, living. in this world there&#039;s no happy endings, there&#039;s no evil, there&#039;s no villains, there&#039;s just... life. bittersweet, heart-wrenching beauty dripping from every pore. I don&#039;t think our world and aoi hana&#039;s is that different, all in all.<br />
<br />
Easy 9/10. Required viewing.

    I tend to make my decisions for a show based on story and characters. So even though I ranked art and sound a little lower than the others, it DID NOT play into my decision for the final rating of the show.<br />
<br />
Before I get started I would like to say that I got involved with this show because I wanted a yuri romance that took things seriously. No excessive fanservice/sexism etc. It delivered! I can not say how awesome this show is in handling a yuri romance in a mature way! (and by mature I mean rational) There is absolutely NO offensive content! <br />
So with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135745">
        that here is my review.<br />
<br />
STORY (9): the story is what you would expect from a yuri/romance, it doesn&#039;t really have a cohesive plot except concerning the progression of the characters and their relationships/lives. This is expected though. It is engrossing, and will have you on your knees hoping that the couple you shipped will be the ones that end up together. Rewatch value is limited though because the plot progression is presented to you in easy to swallow ways, so it is doubtful that you will find something the second time around that you didn&#039;t pick up on the first time around. That said, you can still rewatch it because its a heartfelt show that will make you want to experience what the characters experienced all over again.<br />
<br />
ART/SOUND (7/7): like i said before, these two don&#039;t play into my decision, that is unless they are so bad that they deserve mention, or they are so good that they deserve mention. The art and sound for this show was neither bad nor good, and that is a good thing because you don&#039;t want super-visuals to distract you from the heartfelt relationships developing before your eyes. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (10): this show has the best character development in an anime I have seen so far. I have limited experience in anime, so I will go farther and say that this show has more character development than 90% of all the other media I have ever seen/used (and that is a sizable amount). You will soon find yourself shipping certain characters based on your own personal tastes, and before long you will be engrossed in how the show handles the potential/developing relationships. This is the highlight of the show.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (9): I am going to use this as a catch-all for the things I loved  about this series. The characters and story are just so well done that I can&#039;t say enough about them. A wonderful and serious depiction of female romance, also can&#039;t stress this enough. Since this was based on a manga, I know the producers of the show couldn&#039;t have done this, but I would have liked more episodes, for two reasons: it is so good that you want more.....and here comes the reason that I gave this show 8/10 (would have gotten 9/10)<br />
****NOTE THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED SPOILER**** ...the main couple doesn&#039;t really have a good resolution, and I will leave it at that. I am currently reading the manga because I heard it had a better resolution. ****END OF POTENTIAL SPOILER****<br />
<br />
OVERALL (8): a terrific show that deserves any praise it gets (for being well done, thought out, and mature), if you like romance (any type of romance) try to keep an open mind and you will be blown away by the emotions here. A must watch for people with a heart... *cough cough* ...just go watch it already! :)<br />
<br />
...also, I am trying to find other yuri/female romances that are non-offensive (though maybe one where you actually &amp; gratifyingly get to see the main couple kiss ;) ), if you have any suggestions comment on my profile, thanks! :)

    Being a homosexual female, I have always been searching for a queer anime that didn&#039;t exist only for the purpose of fan service. I wanted an actual love story between a queer couple. One day, I was searching online for some more shoujo ai to watch and I came across this one. When I started watching this show and all the way to the end of the season, I thought, &quot;Finally! This is exactly the queer love story I have been looking for in an anime.&quot;<br />
<br />
They don&#039;t use queerness as an excuse for fan service. The lesbians in this show are just human, and not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213943">
        treated as objects for the audience to enjoy for entertainment. Strawberry Panic was a cheezy soap opera. YuruYuri pretty much uses offensive humor that is sometimes sexual. The characters in Sakura Trick are really stupid and you can tell that the only purpose for the show was to show a bunch of girls making out. The story made a good excuse for the kissing, but the whole show was more about the kissing than the actual story or characters themselves. <br />
<br />
I also appreciated that they feature bisexual and polyamorous characters. Again, not for the soul purpose of fan service. There&#039;s actually a couple in this show who are in a cannon open relationship. Also, they actually use the words &quot;bisexual&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot;. There are only two animes I have seen that actually use words like &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;straight&quot;, &quot;bisexual&quot;, &quot;lesbian&quot;, etc. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a cultural thing, but that always struck me as odd considering how often those words are used in western culture.<br />
<br />
What I especially love about this show is that the primary focus is on the romance and character development. If you are also an anime watcher looking for a queer love story that is actually reflective of real life, this is the show for you.<br />
<br />
I also love the opening. It&#039;s short, it&#039;s minimal, it only focuses on our two main characters. What blows me away every time I watch it is the last shot showing Fumi and Akira, looking into each other&#039;s eyes, nude. What amazes me about it is, yes it&#039;s a nude shot, but there is actually a legit reason for that nude shot. If that shot wasn&#039;t there, anyone watching the opening would assume that this is a story about a totally platonic friendship because the opening up until that point, all we see is Fumi and Akira being innocent together and playing around in a friendly way. The nude shot tells the audience that this is, in fact, not just a platonic relationship, this is a legit lesbian relationship.<br />
<br />
I also recommend picking up in the manga where the anime left off. Akira and Fumi&#039;s relationship actually starts shortly after the point where the anime left of and they actually become really serious. Also, the manga (at least in the latter chapters) focus on what it&#039;s like to be a queer woman in a still pretty heteronormative society like Japan. It actually becomes a social commentary in that regard. It&#039;s actually quite a shame that this anime didn&#039;t go on for more than one season.<br />
<br />
In any case, I highly recommend Aoi Hana. I recommend the anime and I also recommend reading the manga after finishing the anime.
