    &quot;At the end of the day, at the end of the day when all was for naught, I can at least take pleasure in knowing that my little sister is waiting at home with open arms and a warm bosom.&quot; — Sophocles<br />
<br />
Since the Armory Show of 1913, the state of Western Civilization has been one of decline. Though the rise of Modernist Art might not seem terribly significant to the average uneducated reader, the paradigm shift from Representational Art to Abstract Art planted the Seeds of Degeneracy that sprouted into the base and rotten Popular &quot;Culture&quot; that we are all so familiar with today. Indeed,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118815">
        with shameless and vile works like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey standing proudly at the vanguard of a modern Literary Movement that panders and coddles its audience, Western Literature has never been in more dire a state. What happened to authors who challenged their readers like real writers do? Where is the bravery? What happened to Subversive Literature like Great Expectations, a veritable seven-part Landmark Masterwork by David Copperfield about an orphan who goes to a secluded school that straddles the edge between &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;? And this horrible trend of dumbed-down throw-away culture is not limited to the realm of Literature (if horrible books like Twilight can even be called as such). We no longer have true artists like Fragonard whose shockingly honest and realistic depictions of the harsh reality of daily life were barred from the Paris Salon of 1863. But where the West has fallen, the East will rise, and today I am going to talk about the work that will undoubtedly serve as the herald of the most important Literary Movement of the new millennium: the Japanese animated television series &quot;As Long as There&#039;s Love, It Doesn&#039;t Matter If He is My Brother, Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a genre of writing called Allegorical Fiction. Considered by the vast majority of Rational and Moral Enlightenment thinkers to be the Highest form of Literature, the great Dutch librettist Voltaire famously said, &quot;Give me not a story about a man who does deeds, but one where the man becomes the deeds.&quot; However, it is not nearly as accessible as a conventional linear narrative with wish-fulfillment elements like Fifty Shades of Grey and as it is very rare to find a work of Allegorical Fiction these days, it is an exceptionally rare treat to be fortunate enough to experience one. As such, we should be very thankful that the underground Japanese Literary Movement known as &quot;Imoutocore&quot; is giving us the opportunity to once again experience works from this all-but-forgotten genre.<br />
<br />
The heart of Imoutocore is Family Values. Yes, these are the same Family Values that have been so savaged abandoned by the vulgar abomination that is Western Popular Culture, and it is a miracle that a small group of Japanese writers were somehow able to remember these vaunted Family Values after almost an entire century of Western Degeneracy. As Saint Thomas Aquinas so eloquently proclaimed on his deathbed, &quot;As men there is much for which we should be thankful, but above all things, it is not the opportunity to know God for which I am most thankful, but the opportunity to know the bosom of my little sister.&quot; Thus, as Aquinas was one of the discoverers of Western Morality, we can infer that the central tenet of Family Values is the ability for one to love one&#039;s little sister.<br />
<br />
Though the seminal Japanese light novel (&quot;light&quot; is short for &quot;en-light-enment&quot;) &quot;My Little Sister Can&#039;t Be This Cute&quot; (Oreimo for short) is arguably the founding work of the Imoutocore Movement, the animated television adaptation of the light novel &quot;As Long as There&#039;s Love, It Doesn&#039;t Matter If He is My Brother, Right?&quot; (OniAi for short) will undoubtedly be remembered as the most important for both its deep and meaningful narrative and the sublime art and animation that was wrought from the hands of the maestros of Studio FUNimation. The crux of the story is what the early 20th century (aka. Pre-Degeneracy) Russian philosopher Edsger Dijkstra called &quot;The Teapot of False Choice.&quot; Although Akito is living in the same house as his rightfully beloved little sister, he is surrounded by temptation in the form of other women. However, as this a work of Allegorical Fiction, the reader is not to think of them as &quot;real&quot; women. Instead, one is best served to think of each as a False Choice that together compose the metaphysical structure that Dijkstra termed &quot;The Spout of Deontology.&quot; As for Akito, although it is tempting to think of him as some sort of Reader Avatar of sorts, he is what translators have varying called &quot;The Cap of Moral Righteousness&quot; or just &quot;The Cap of Justice.&quot; When the Cap of Justice is in place, the only way for tea to escape the teapot is by following the Path of False Choices on the Spout of Deontology. Or in layman&#039;s terms, Akiko is best girl and a perfect miracle of the universe and MC is an ignoble gentleman for ignoring her and consorting with other females.<br />
<br />
Although Visual Art is the most corrupted aspect of contemporary Western Civilization—recall that the Seeds of Degeneracy were planted by Modernist Artists in the first place—the Japanese arthouse film collective Studio FUNimation was able to shed the weight of one hundred years of Degenerate Art and produce what can objectively be called nothing less than a feast for the eyes. Drawn in the style of Socialist Realism that was favoured by Russian masters like Lu Xun and Ai Weiwei, a complete mastery of the female anatomical form is not only demonstrated in the art of &quot;As Long as There&#039;s Love, It Doesn&#039;t Matter If He is My Brother, Right?&quot; but employed as a key element of its unique style of visual storytelling. Indeed, even the Greeks were not fully confident in their mastery of the human form and frequently used lewd distractions like exposed genitalia in order to distract viewers from anatomical imperfections. Furthermore, they, nor any culture that followed were skillful enough to use the female form in such a bold way as the Siscons (the term that Imoutocore artists use to refer to themselves) do in this work. Boldly bringing new meaning to the term &quot;False Choice,&quot; Akito&#039;s temptation is profoundly palatable in each and every scene where the talented artists of Studio FUNimation grace the screen with their powerful depictions of the components of The Spout of Deontology.<br />
<br />
The reason why I started this review with a quote from the great Roman tragedian Sophocles is simple: &quot;As Long as There&#039;s Love, It Doesn&#039;t Matter If He is My Brother, Right?&quot; is a tragedy. In the end, Akito is unable to make the right choice, is unable to love his little sister, and is unable to uphold Family Values within his household. The ending of this story is perhaps the very saddest in Literature, as the heart of any viewer should wrench during the highly emotional climax and somber aftermath. And after everything, when we realize that his little sister will never truly know the love of her older brother, we also realize that just as Akito is doomed, Western Civilization is as well. But as the Korean sociologist Watari Wataru added to the end of one of his treatises recently, &quot;My wife might have left me and I didn&#039;t get tenure, but goddamn am I glad that OniAi is getting a second season.&quot;

    Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! is one of those Ecchi-anime which happen to pop up once in a while and though there may be a ton of crappy ones, some of them at least have a decent story, or a good sense of humor, making up for the usual flaws Ecchi-anime often have.<br />
<br />
But nope, we are out of luck with this one, meaning that this anime does not have a decent story and while we´re at it, it also lacks of interesting characters, character development and all the other stuff that make up a decent anime. <br />
<br />
To be fair, it´s an Ecchi,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81156">
        so there isn´t a real need for story and deep characters, I can somehow understand that point of view but it´s no excuse for not having it at all, saying: it´s Ecchi, so who cares about that crap, just add some boobs and panty shots and call it a day. <br />
Is it really too much, if you ask for quality ? <br />
<br />
Starting with an unbelievably embarrassing intro, which by the way sums up the whole anime, we get to know a handful of girls who all try to seduce one guy.<br />
By the way, thats all there is to it, that is the whole story, once again, it´s an Ecchi but if you are really trying to make a good anime, even Ecchi needs at least SOMETHING you can work with.<br />
There really is nothing special about the characters whatsoever, we got the brocon girl, the big titted brute, the bisexual pervert, the housewife and a loli, to top it all, we get to know a seemingly mentally disabled manga editor, who is so incredibly stupid that, well I can´t find words to describe her awkwardness.<br />
<br />
If you like Ecchi, there are plenty of moments that will give you your 12 year old boy panty shot boner, the whole series consists mostly of Ecchi moments, perverted communication and girls seducing a boy who does not give a damn.<br />
This is, suprisingly enough, the best part of the whole series, the main character just does not care about all the nymphomaniac crap that s going on in his home, letting all the girls run against a wall over and over again, funny, but no salvation, more like a sacrifice.<br />
Talk about humor, I did not laugh that often during the nine episodes that I have watched, though there are plenty of funny scenes but they just did not get me.<br />
<br />
So whats left ? <br />
I really did not enjoy watching this anime, and it felt really awkward that after a week of waiting, I get nothing but brocon pervertedness and swimsuit-softporn. <br />
<br />
3 points for this one, if you want real Ecchi, there is enough thats better and if you want real Comedy, there is even more than enough thats better.<br />
But if you can enjoy anime without development, story, deep characters etc. then please, give it a try but don´t blame me, if you feel like your time was wasted.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Tsundere Right? Follow me. I don&#039;t like you one bit. Not at all<br />
Reply: I don&#039;t see you as a love interest one bit. Not at all.<br />

Every anime has its own priorities, or goals. If every anime was aiming for the same thing then there would be little variety. Shounen anime like one piece or naruto are meant to make the watchers enjoy awesome fights and power ups through a long adventure and Key productions such as Clannad and Angel beats are meant to be a romance story that could make a grown man cry.<br />
<br />
OniAi(this anime) does not aim for a romance or action.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77771">
        Comedy is the only goal. If you expect a plot or a goal then this is not for you.<br />
<br />
OniAi is an anime aiming to be a romantic comedy. Do not let the word romance fool you. It uses romance as comedy, there is no actual romance development.<br />
<br />
OK. After all I have said it may sound I am a huge critic who hates this show. Not at all. In fact, I love it. It does its job splendidly making me smile and laugh so much throughout an episode I need to calm down because my face hurts due to smiling ( I am doing so as of now ). <br />
<br />
Story-9<br />
The story is the little sister trying to win her brother&#039;s heart (kind of... the methods are... strange). It is hilarious with all the obstacles and events she has to overcome and how she gets past them. <br />
<br />
Art-8<br />
The art is very nice, colorful and fits with the mood of happiness and laughter. The pictures bring out the best of each characters. However I have a tiny problem with the eyepatch which reminds me of evil pirates so it&#039;s an 8.<br />
<br />
Sound-9<br />
The sound is very well done and the characters voices could give you a good idea of what is going on, even if you don&#039;t understand ( trust me I tried ). The sound blends well with the show and amazing.<br />
<br />
Character-10<br />
This is perhaps my favorite part of the show. The characters are all unique, though quite unrealistic and symbolizing a strange trait or characteristic their interactions are simply hilarious. I also love how the characters react to different situations and their strange attract to Akito ( the main character ). Best of all there is no stupid male perv that ruins moments by acting stupid stupid stupid. The introduction of new characters is equally enjoyable as you get to see new characters representing something you may like or would of liked to see.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10<br />
A smile is much easier to make than a frown is so false. It usually takes a ton to make me laugh out loud. However, if it takes a ton to make me laugh out loud then this show would be like a trillion tons of comedy and happiness. I laugh at every moment and it does not make me sad, angry or depressed at all. This is pretty much laughing gas compressed and packed in an anime. Super duper enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
If you want to smile, laugh, have fun. Or just take a break from your stressful life, watch this. If you are simply looking for a story with a great plot or something this won&#039;t have it. I would consider this a masterpiece at what is does, which is comedy however I really do not expect much of a story. If you have seen one of those harems where the indecisive male lead gets nothing accomplished, expect it. However, this is not due to indecisiveness but to the uniqueness of the situation and how the anime would actually lower in grade due to plot. The comedy would greatly reduce if anything was actually accomplished and the unstable situation is what causes the laughter and happiness to overflow (kind of like how unstable ions can make explosions or something). <br />
<br />
This is definitely a good watch for having fun. Try it! (if you read books it&#039;s kind of life Dr.Seuss books vs the Hunger Games or Harry Potter except this anime is wayyyyy funnier)

    Guilty pleasures...things you know are bad but like them regardless. This show would have to be one of my biggest guilty pleasures of 2012. So generic, so predictable, yet funny and entertaining at the same time. <br />
<br />
Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne, or OniAi, is yet another fan service heavy romance anime. An incestuous tale about about a high-school girl who, after six long years, finally gets to see her beloved brother. After some random unexplained developments, the story develops into a harem in just the first episode. <br />
<br />
From there, the plot becomes extremely predictable to the point of just being plain sad.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81212">
        A mere copy and paste of every other bland romantic comedy. As if having one of those every season now isn&#039;t bad enough. At least add some twists to it like Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru did.<br />
<br />
The characters are just as predictable. You have your normal guy main character who just wants a quiet life. Then you have your cast of horny, hot, and cute girls. All of which fall into generic anime stereotypes. Examples? Well you have your brother complex little sister, childhood friend, rich blond girl, and mature/seductive girl. I can&#039;t say they were not funny though. It is always amusing to watch anime chicks do crazy things for the one they love. <br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much i can say for the sound, except that i think the voice actors did a good job. They portrayed the cute cast of girls very well. The opening song and its suggestive scenes were pretty good too. Not to mention it was very erotic.<br />
<br />
I loved the artwork in OniAi. Silver Link and their bright animations always gave me a pleasant feeling inside. The backgrounds were colorful, and the characters looked very attractive.<br />
<br />
OniAi severely lacks in originality and effort to keep the viewers interested. Fan service and cliche jokes were the only thing that kept me watching. Honestly, that was all it took. Boobs and lame jokes had me watching this all the way to episode twelve. Sometimes, that is all it takes to make an anime enjoyable.<br />
<br />
OniAi was an OK anime overall. Like i said in the beginning, this is a guilty pleasure. There are obviously many faults with it, but that does not mean you should completely condemn this series without giving it a shot.  Lower your expectations and bit, and enjoy it for what it is.

    Alright so everyone knows series are made to bring something entertaining to the table and not always something new. This is a perfect example a bunch of girls that love the main guy as well as live in the same dorm as he does and they mess with him all the time but that is because they love him. This is the point of this series is sheer ecchi harem comedy, it doesn&#039;t deliver anything else.<br />
So while many people may not find this reassuring I found it refreshing as to how they compete against each other for the protagonist&#039;s attention.<br />
If by any chance you are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92719">
        looking for something to cheer you up and ecchi harem comedies are your type then this series is waiting for you.

    (Before you plan to absolutely downvote this review &amp; start saying something against this anime because of 9 points I gave it,please read this review first,thank you:D)<br />
<br />
(*Comedy+<br />
brocon-<br />
Likeness meter=?*)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ecchi anime have been quite popular lately.Every season,there are 2-4 ecchi manga+novels which get an adaptation.Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai Yo Ne(Yup,this is its full name:O)is one of those highly ecchi anime which get an adaptation &amp; become quite popular among a certain group of people.<br />
<br />
This is a hit or miss kind of anime.Its wonderful if you watch it for its comedy &amp; characters(Which are lovable) &amp;  overly-disgusting if you get offended by the bro-con.So watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review82096">
        it if you can bear implemented FALSE bro-con &amp; are a big comedy lover &amp; also if u like to see harem anime.Don&#039;t watch it if you are only going to say,&quot;How disgusting it is...there is bro-con&quot; without even completing it first(as there is a TWIST) so with this introduction,lets begin:D<br />
<br />
Story:-(8/10)<br />
<br />
The story,huh..I guess it is about a sister wanting to marry with her brother or what if I say it is about a bunch of high-schoolers living in the same building,two of them being brother where the brother has full harem(ofcourse,including the sister).Either way,story is not this anime&#039;s strong point.<br />
<br />
We have Akiko,who loves her brother,Akito in a romantic way.She has been separated from her brother for quite a long period of time.Now finally she is able to stay at his place for completing her high school studies &amp; is overjoyed because of it as she may now be able to spend much more time but suddenly her plans get ruined when the student council presiden,Arashi,Vice president,Anastasia(Ana for short) &amp; Accountant,Ginbei also come to stay there.So it is about her STRUGGLE on dealing with them &amp; still getting her brother to love her..huh...<br />
<br />
For me,this is a cliche but a nice story but It is easily one of the best comedic harem anime I have ever seen.You will get some good laughs,some great laughs &amp; some loud laughs till you get tired of having them:)<br />
<br />
Art:-(9/10)<br />
<br />
About 95 percent of this anime is spent in the building in which our main cast lives(just like in seitokai no ichizon)The remaining 5 percent is spent in school(mainly in student council) &amp; there are some rare scenes outside plus at Akito&#039;s part time job as a incest novelist(yeah incest..)I<br />
<br />
Regardless of this,this anime has done a great job in art department.All the girls are just beautifully drawn &amp; are Moe-kyun worthy=).I just love Ana &amp; Akiko&#039;s expressions.Akiko for numerous faces she makes &amp; Ana for that...straight face.<br />
<br />
I think it is a bit unique too in this department since I have not seen these kind of character designs before so it is different..Its colorful,vibrant plus animation is fluid which is a plus for anyone.<br />
<br />
Sound:-(9/10)<br />
<br />
The opening song..............is soo soooooo goood.I just adore it.I could listen it for hours &amp; still not be bored.I don&#039;t think so there has been a single episode in which I didn&#039;t hear it AT LEAST twice.This is one of those reasons,I love this anime.The ending song...is the opposite of opening song.I don&#039;t feel anything for it.It is just okay..Bgm is also nice.<br />
<br />
Voice-actors have done a great job(I really mean it)Their could not be a better choice for each character&#039;s respective voice actor.Akiko&#039;s voice actor has done that cute voice which her character demands.I can&#039;t believe it is her debut,She sounds so professional.Ana&#039;s voice actor has done the same which goes well with her straight face.Ginbei&#039;s boyish voice &amp; Arashi&#039;s aggressiveness goes well with her respective seiyuu&#039;s voice.<br />
<br />
So,this anime is great even in sound department.Voice-acting &amp; opening songs is a big plus.I am cutting 1 point because of its ending song as it is a disappointment:(<br />
<br />
Characters:-(10/10)<br />
<br />
Oh my God,this anime has some lovable characters.Totally one of the strongest points of this series.Each character has a unique personality although some are explained more &amp; others less which is a bit disappointing as it is a lovable series but all of them are great.<br />
<br />
First of all,Akito is a pretty nice protagonist.I actually like him.For once,there is a good protagonist in an harem anime.<br />
<br />
Akiko has those cute expressions &amp; that ever-echoing laugh in my ears&quot;Guhehehe,guhe&quot;I don&#039;t know how much I love that.Her aggressiveness is also notable.<br />
<br />
When it comes to aggressiveness,no one can beat Arashi.She is really a storm(Arashi means Storm:D).She wears an eye-patch which is attractive,I guess.<br />
<br />
Ginbei has those boyish features &amp; she is actually childhood friend of Akito due to which she believes that she will be forever in the friends zone with him..<br />
<br />
Finally Ana,the silent queen.She is just so charming with that straight face &amp; is usually  calm but when that wall of calmness is broken,a totally new Ana appears who is so cute as well.Her name is a joke as well(see the series for more information...)<br />
<br />
There are also some side-characters.Arisa who is fiancee(I just love this word) of Akito due to SOME circumstances.A young loli who is a genius &amp; can do anything from cooking to ...all other things.Jinno is Akito&#039;s editor &amp; has a misunderstanding about Akito as she thinks that he is a sis-con AND a loli-con....<br />
<br />
This anime is just intriguing when it comes to characters.I just love each &amp; everyone of them but my favorite is still Akiko.2nd is ofcourse Ana.<br />
<br />
So,10/10 for this:D<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall:-(10/10)/(9/10)<br />
<br />
This anime is amazingly done.Too bad it ended with a unexpected twist.<br />
I just love,no...adore it.That comedy &amp; of course Akiko&#039;s laugh,I am going to miss so much.Guhehehehe.I love how the preview is done.A really good anime for me.<br />
<br />
So my last advice is that do not watch this anime if you can not handle..again..FALSE bro-con(as I call it) &amp; if you are a comedy lover(like me),want some great anime with outstanding characters &amp; don&#039;t mind lack of action,story then I strongly suggest it.So I hope you will watch this anime &amp; my review will be able to attract you to this anime.Don&#039;t watch it if you are just going to leave it incomplete forever in your list....<br />
<br />
So I guess this is time to....answer my own question which is in the beginning of this review.<br />

    *sniff sniff* I smell Harem!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne tells the story of how Akito and Akiko, two twins separated at birth, are finally reunited after 6 years. The two of them live together in an old dorm with three other females and the five of them make up the student council of their school. Now this seems all fine and dandy except for one problem though: while Akito seems pretty normal, his sister developed this very, VERY serious brother complex. Combine this with the fact that the other three girls are attracted to Akito in some way shape or form and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75585">
        you’ve got yourself a comedy.<br />
<br />
Romantic Comedies (especially harems) are tricky due to idea of unoriginality and stereotypes. I’m not going to lie to you, ALL the characters are stereotypes. Despite that, I so far find the series enjoyable in how they execute their humor. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Akito- The male protagonist and object of affection of the girls around him. Aside from being the landlord, he is also the student counsel&#039;s &quot;vice-assistant of proxy of secretary&quot;. A pretty normal high schooler who wants to lead a peaceful life. (Note: something VERY interesting gets discovered about him at the beginning of episode 2)<br />
<br />
Akiko- Akito&#039;s sister and the secretary of the student counsel. She is constantly (and i mean CONSTANTLY) trying to seduce her brother despite his refusals and obvious uninterest. She even comes up with all these cliché setups for her brother to follow since they live together. She doesn’t even try to hind it and is in fact proud of it.<br />
<br />
Anastasia or Ana for short (youll get the joke after the first episode)- is the vice-president of the student council and the rich, stoic expression wearing stereotype. Because of her background, she can’t do chores like cleaning and cooking but she can say the most ridicules things with a straight face.<br />
<br />
Ginbee- the accountant of the student counsel and Akito&#039;s childhood friend. She looks and sounds rather boyish and seems forever friend zoned by Akito<br />
<br />
Arashi- the president of the student council. She has red hair, an eye patch, and caries around a wooden sword (nothing stereotypical about that). She seems like the cougar of the group<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The artwork seems very bright and colorful to fit the upbeatness of the story. My only complaint is that everyones mouth looks like a triangle<br />
<br />
OP-ED:<br />
Although I didnt enjoy the music for the opening OR ending, it did seem catchy so it might grow on you. The VISUALS for the OP, however, could not make me stop laughing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
One stereotype the series DOESN&#039;T follow is how the main character responds to the girls advances. In fact, it’s HOW he responds that attributes too much of the comedy in the series. While Akito seems as normal as they come, the way he flat out DENIES the advances of the girls around him develops a good dose of humor. If you enjoy a good comedy with a simple plot then give this show a try. If your turned off by incest, stereotypes, and harems, then look away.

    What i like most about this show just overall is it breaks conventions. It treads boldly on the taboo subject of a incestuous relationship. For once it broke the general cliche half siblings so its ok to love each other story line, in this they really go for it in blood related sibling relationship. I don&#039;t have a particular interest in that Genre of plot but i respect the fact they are boldly going somewhere new with the plot.<br />
<br />
The story is very episodic in nature and only really continues the plot in that it develops the relationships of all the characters. There is no real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79004">
        antagonist or conflict so far which is kinda interesting for once. It splits up the episodes pretty evenly among all the characters and gives us a little more of them each time we see them. It is a harem style anime so its very perverted in nature with lots of adult themed jokes and such. <br />
<br />
The characters of this show all together are a lot more bold with whats happening. You have dead pan and mono toned girls saying blunt and indecent statements and you have very high strung characters displaying obsession quite openly. With a abundance of sexual innuendo and tension it becomes very amusing. Each character is different in pretty much every way and they may not exactly be a new concept they are a lot more unique than first glance. I liked the fact the perverted character in this show isn&#039;t the brother, its all the girls in the show that are always trying to seduce him. <br />
<br />
This show just seems very comfortable with itself and is not trying to go out of its way to conform to every other generic harem plot line and character. It delivers adult humor with such a casual demeanor that i cant help but be amused by it. It could be even more adventurous with its plots and overall story but its doing great for what it is and i would like it if a few other shows took notes about how to get outside the box.<br />
<br />
Some people may disagree with me but i think its the little things in this anime that make it worth watching. If your a fan of more adult humor and like cute slice of life styled atmosphere you may really enjoy this. I can understand people with a extreme moral fiber may be put off completely by the idea of a incestuous relationship or the amount of suggestive content but for a general audience i think they may appreciate it.

    First things first if you don&#039;t like the echi genre you should still give this show a try . So there maybe some brother-sister love but its completely one sided so if thats what is turning you off from watching this show then dont worry about it, there you go NOW GO WATCH IT. This is based on the first three episodes and all i gotta say is that if your not laughing by the end of the episodes then......well i dont know maybe this isnt your cup of tea. But so far so good

    &quot;I love you Onii-chan!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, we cant, we related by blood&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe thats two sentence was almost appear in every episode of this anime, and from that sentences we can presume that this anime was about brocon, what is brocon? Brocon is when your little sister is falling in love with your big brother.seems weird heh? but i dont think so.<br />
<br />
as far as we can see, when we thinks about brocon or even siscon anime, we&#039;re gonna like &quot;Uhhhh, thats disgusting, i hate it&quot; or maybe &quot;thats broke the law of nature!&quot; oh okay, relax. On my perspective on watching anime, i always thought do not rated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84663">
        the anime if we havent finished the series yet, and thats why i thought this anime WAS UNDERRATED.<br />
<br />
First of all, this story was simple, its about Akiko Himenokouji that loves his brother Himenokouji Akito, yeah, you can said Akiko has a serious brocon complex,  and the problem is that his brother is didnt accept his love except he loves her as just as his sister. thats reasonable for me, not only that, more problem was waiting for her since all member in dormitory was in love too with Akito, and of course they are competing to get Akito attention. so basically, this was a harem anime which add some brocon in the story. simple. Furthermore, i found the joke really hit the spot, as for me, it was funny. it doesnt exaggerating and even imposing the jokes, so the jokes itself was flowing naturally.<br />
<br />
Like other harem anime, we can presume that this anime will lack of character,  hmm... i dont really think so. Every character in this anime has their own story why she was falling in love with the Akito. and thats make sense and sounds reasonable for me why they fallin in love with him. and more, what makes me think this harem anime was special is, there was a flashback for some character. i think, its rare to see the flashback for the character in harem, especially harem will always feature the fanservice and pantsu event of course. Honestly, this anime has a lot of fanservice too, but the fanservice itself is related with the story and again not too exaggerate it.<br />
<br />
As for the art, i cant said too much on this, but what i love from this was the coloring. it was beautiful and each character is well made. and more, i love the smile from each girl, its so cute, like K-on character. i thinks that a plus for  the smile, since silver link really know how to make a character looks more cuter.<br />
<br />
And for the sound, i find this was amazingly good. they (the seiyuu) really embedded the feelings into the character and its very well made. moreover, the seiyuu for Akiko is a newcomer, but she performs like a pro seiyuu. especially the laughter from Akiko is really unique, they made their own (KUHEHEHE~), same as the famous sound &quot;Tutturu~&quot; from Mayuri, steins;gate. and as for the OP, it was good too. it really fits with the anime.<br />
<br />
And the conclusion was, as we know, this anime mainpoint was comedy, so i thought the purpose was to entertain the viewer, and as for me, they had completed that purpose, i had fun watching this anime. and furthermore, i thought why this anime was score so low, well, each people have their own perspective about what anime they likes, and for me, i found this anime was UNDERRATED. and once again, dont judge this anime if you havent watched all the series, your perspective about this anime is brocon will vanished.

    Oh wow, I have to admit, I never expected to enjoy this anime so much! <br />
<br />
This series&#039; full name is &#039;Onii-Chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai Yo Ne!&#039; Oh how is loosely translates in English, &#039;It Doesn&#039;t Matter If He&#039;s My Big Brother, As Long As I Love Him, Right?&#039;  This anime was adapted from the light novel series of the same name written by Daisuke Suzuki and the artwork was by Gekka Uruu. Now the author has written another light novel series before writing this one which was also made into an anime. “Goshuushou-Sama Ninomiya-Kun” And like this series, that one is also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84535">
        an ecchi harem series but it doesn&#039;t have the incestuous love element that this series has. I haven&#039;t seen Goshuushou-Sama Ninomiya-Kun but if it&#039;s anything like this series then I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll enjoy it! <br />
<br />
To tell the truth, I&#039;ve only read the first 3 of the 8 light novels that are out but those are the only ones I could find with an english translation, and even then, I was going to try my hand at reading the original Japanese novels but I couldn&#039;t find them anywhere online so I just had to settle for the first three novels to learn from. I&#039;ve also read the manga adaption but once again, I didn&#039;t have much to read since there were only 5 chapters out online. <br />
<br />
Now I feel like I have to warn you right now if you want to check out this anime that it&#039;s rated 16+ it&#039;s got plenty of ecchi moments and there are scenes were characters get completely naked but there&#039;s censorship around the really naughty bits. And if you&#039;re really close-minded and absolutely hate the idea of an incestuous relationship, then I don&#039;t suggest watching this. <br />
<br />
Story- The plot for this anime is pretty simple. These incest-related light novel series seem to have plots like this. But even though the plot is pretty simple, that doesn&#039;t stop this from being an enjoyable romantic comedy anime. Through the whole anime, nothing much really happens, it&#039;s just comedy for comedy&#039;s sake with a bunch of fanservice thrown in. But for what it&#039;s worth, the plot may be simple but if you&#039;re into comedy anime or slice of life anime, or even enjoy a good harem anime series then you&#039;re going to enjoy this.<br />
<br />
Art- The animation work on this anime was done by Silver Link, they are best known for animating the “Baka To Test&#039; anime, and I have to admit, I really like the way they animated this series. One point that I really liked was that the eyelashes were colored to match the character&#039;s hair colors, which I think is a little unrealistic but it does bring a nice bit of depth to the character&#039;s eyes and made them really pop to me. I also loved the little bit of shine that they added to the character&#039;s skin, even though that&#039;s a common trait to find in ecchi anime like this. <br />
<br />
Sound- The opening theme for this anime is called “Self-Producer” and it&#039;s sung by Minori Chihara, who is the voice of Anastasia Natsuhara. And I just love how much energy is in this song! And considering that there isn&#039;t a full English translation here online yet, I&#039;m going to be working on translating it into English the best that I can even though I&#039;m not 100% fluent in Japanese. And the ending theme song is called “Life Ru Is Love Ru” and this is sung by the female cast of the show, the main 4 female characters sing this ending song. And once again, this song is just full of energy and is just addicting to me and I can&#039;t get enough of it! The voice cast are all pretty well known in the anime community and they all did a wonderful job with voicing the characters for this anime! I found no faults with them here.<br />
<br />
Character- All of the characters in this anime are all vibrant and interesting to say the least, these characters all have their own quirks that make you love them, and I had no issues with any of them, which is rare since I tend to find an issue with every any character I find in an anime like this but not this one and I commend the author for creating such wonderful characters! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- This anime had a lot of good moments, moments that made me go &#039;aww&#039; or made me laugh, this anime was very enjoyable to me and I was looking forward to each episode. And one of the quirks about the episodes is that we see focus on pretty much every character and no one is left out, which i find rather hard to balance with harem series like this with more then one female lead but this was executed really nicely, the jokes were all funny and the ecchi moments weren&#039;t too over the top either. Overall, I enjoyed the anime through and through and didn&#039;t get bored at all and was thoroughly entertained!<br />
<br />
Overall- I would recommend this anime for anyone who loves the slice of life genre like I do, or anyone who loves comedy or fan service or even ecchi anime like this, but like before if you don&#039;t like incest or don&#039;t like ecchi and are very close-minded then I wouldn&#039;t advise this anime, but if you can get past those little details then you&#039;ll find a very funny and enjoyable anime out of OniAi! I would especially recommend this to anyone who loves the romantic comedy genre of anime. I honestly don&#039;t see why this anime gets bad reviews, I&#039;ve seen my share of bad anime before and this one wasn&#039;t one of them!

    Well now there are many ways to approach this anime review. I could review it based solely on the anime or I could compare it to the light novel and inform you what was lost in the “translation”. For the sake of giving the anime a fair shot, I will score it based only on the anime itself but I will be injecting notes on what the anime could have done better in comparison to the light novel.<br />
<br />
So the anime does a pretty piss poor job of explaining what is going on and keeping your feelings invested towards the characters. The plot is essentially a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100221">
        reuniting of Akito and his sister Akiko after a long separation. They end up living in the same house along with the student council at their high school and the usually boy x girl events happen. The anime unfortunately comes across as a generic harem while the light novel feels more like a serious drama. The anime has all the typical harem scenes that we have experienced in the past; the shower scene, the mall scene, etc. I hate to say it but the anime really looks and feels as if it was put together very half-hazardly and was trying to ride on the success of the light novel. Please understand that this is NOT a faithful adaptation of the light novel.<br />
<br />
The animation is somewhat a mixed bag; it looks great in some scenes but the overall quality is somewhat lower than what I would expect from a 2012 anime. The characters are visually appealing but the show lacks a certain visual aspect that sets itself apart from all the other anime. This lighting is not done very well, you see many instances where proportions do not really match up, ext. The animation just comes off as generic for eighty percent of the time.<br />
<br />
The only redeeming quality for this anime in the sound department are the voice actors’ performances. Each character’s voice actor did a superb job injecting their feelings into their characters. Anastasia has a cold, monotone personality that is expressed well by her voice actor. Even the annoying but too cute Akiko’s voice actor did an amazing job making Akiko a loved and disliked character. Other than the voice acting though the anime falls pretty low on the bar as far as sound goes. The background music is forgettable and generic but the intro and ending songs are quite catchy.<br />
<br />
The cast of this anime work very well with each other even if most of them are forgettable. Akito, Akiko and Anastasia were for me the stars of the show. Akito’s strong will and intellect, Akiko’s annoying but super cute personality, and Anastasia’s cold and cool attitude created so many funny and unique scenes throughout the entire anime. My personal favorite character was Anastasia because even though her personality withheld most of her true feelings from everyone else, it was easy to always tell what was on her mind. Also her interactions with Akito were the most fun to watch. The other characters however were either boring or just not appealing. I especially found Arashi just out of place and a bother to the whole chemistry of the group. The young house leader was also quite annoying and off putting. Overall the main three characters really helps make the show shine but a couple others bring it back down.<br />
<br />
Overall the anime adaptation of Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne (what a mouthful) is just generic. After reading some of the light novel a couple months before the airing of the anime, I was very excited to see the brother sister romance issue unfold with the student council. What unfortunately occurred here was taking a great drama with very thought provoking and witty conversations and turning it into another generic and barely passable harem anime. I advise that you steer clear from the anime and just read the light novel. It is much better than the anime and it will have you craving for more.

    I&#039;ll start off by saying that i dropped this anime at episode 4...but I do have a pretty good understanding of the story. At least as much as you can get in 4 episodes.<br />
<br />
Story-4<br />
-----------<br />
The summary of the show didn&#039;t particularly draw me in, but I do find ecchi shows to be funny and enjoyable, and the incest love thing was at first thought sickening to me, but then I decided to look past that and just enjoy it. That just became impossible because of how boring the show is though. I found episode 1 to be the most interesting and it got boring fast starting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80606">
        at 2 and by 4 I just couldn&#039;t stand it anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art-6<br />
-----------<br />
The art is probably the best thing about this show, and that&#039;s not saying much. It&#039;s bland and typical. I&#039;m mostly referring to the characters of course because everything else is just meh.<br />
<br />
Sound-6<br />
---------------------<br />
The OP/EDs of the show are enjoyable, but not anything I would download and listen to in my free time. The voice actors are good, but it&#039;s sad they got put on a show like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character-1<br />
------------------<br />
The characters in this show are the show, and they&#039;re not the best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-3<br />
--------------------<br />
I got some enjoyment out of the show, for the weird take on a harem, but it was just not a show I could bring myself to finish or miss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall-5<br />
------------------<br />
This show could have been something interesting. Instead, the only thing i&#039;m taking away is Japan has no limits to where they are willing to go, perverted wise. That&#039;s what makes a lot of anime great, but it&#039;s the only thing that makes this anime exist and it just isn&#039;t enough.

    In my opinion<br />
It&#039;s kind of shocking when i watch this anime, i really doesn&#039;t expect that this anime will show many heavy-ecchi parts. First i though it&#039;s just like a normal daily life, but it turn out to be so much different than i have predicted.<br />
<br />
The story is kind of irregular, there was no clear-conclusion where the plot will take us. It&#039;s more like a collection of short stories of what kind of life that Akito have.<br />
The art is good, the color used is fit with the genre of the anime.<br />
The sound, i love the voice actors! Each characters have their own unique method of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84127">
        talking and their own unique accent (you&#039;ll know if you watch it), especially when Akiko make a &quot;guhehehe&quot; sounds, it&#039;s right to the spot. I don&#039;t really like the op and ed songs though.<br />
The characters, personally i just like Akiko, Anastasia, and Arashi. They have their unique characters and their designs is great too. For the other heroines, i think the personalities they inherit is too simple, so it really doesn&#039;t leave a mark.<br />
<br />
I recommend this anime for those who love comedy, daily-life, harem, romance and ecchi.<br />
This anime is made for those who want to laugh, but please remind that there are so many dirty jokes among them. So for those who dislike ecchi stuff, it&#039;s better to not watch this. Not just the dirty jokes, there are also many fanservices in this anime so watch your back when you watch this! XD<br />
This anime focused more on the harem parts than the romance parts, so you&#039;ll found just a few doki-doki emotions from the heroines (many of them come from Anastasia which make her very cute).<br />
The easy daily-life with many comedy parts make this anime fun and no-tiring to watch. Altough the plot is unclear, the entertaintment is enough to make up for it.

    This one is hard. Definitely a guilty pleasure.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
I came to this after reading the light novels it was based on. I won&#039;t say I loved the novels, I sometimes had to skip over the parts with Anna in them, but I admired their depictions of Akito as a very sound minded kind of guy. He&#039;s stuck in a very moe situation, I won&#039;t say harem, but very close to it, and unlike most harem heroes, he keeps his head about him. Very little really freaks this guy out. Three girls including his sister are coming onto him hard and he stays relatively cool and can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180781">
        even be very charming and insightful. A lot of times his dialogue, just his ability to keep calm and say the right things to break up the moe and keep it real honestly impressed me at times. <br />
<br />
It went so far I had to believe I was misreading the novels. After all it was a translation and it was just writing. Maybe the author intended that Akito was really screaming these lines. Could he really be this cool? I seriously doubted it. And I want to thank this anime, because without it, I would never have been sure just how cool the character of Akito could be. As it turns out, he was everything I dreamed he was and more. I love this character and his depiction in the anime, I have to say pretty much borders on perfect.<br />
<br />
Now is when I should probably bring up that the disgust generated by this anime caused the people who were working tirelessly translating the light novels to drop them completely.<br />
<br />
The main problem I think is that the studio was looking for a harem anime to capitalize on Oreimo&#039;s success and well, the novels just weren&#039;t quite moe enough. I can&#039;t help going into some detail on the changes they made, I&#039;m sorry. If you want the short version, they messed it up both in big ways - really freaking huge ways - and in small subtle ways as well.<br />
<br />
Premise:<br />
The story starts just after Akito has spirited his twin sister Akiko away in the night from the estate of her adopted parents to the run down old fashioned shack of a house he rented because he&#039;s a freaking hero and he can&#039;t help it. Only in this version he just kind off bought what looks like a mansion and waited there for her to come to him after shipping most of her stuff. <br />
<br />
Okay no more details. It&#039;s been seven years since Akito and Akiko were adopted and split up by rival families because their parents died and these rivals saw an opportunity to eliminate the opposition. Akito at that time swore to Akiko that one day they would be reunited. They would live under the same roof again, retake their family name, and no one would ever force them apart again. And seven year&#039;s later he&#039;s finally done it. <br />
<br />
Only Akiko, reflecting for seven years on the words he spoke to her has come to believe that the two of them were desperately in love with eachother as children and his oath was a declaration of love and his intent to effectively marry his sister. And now the time has come and she is all for it. Akito&#039;s feelings can be summed up in his line, &quot;I love you more than anyone else in the world - as a sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the anime jumps I don&#039;t know how many months ahead and has very little else to do with the novels from now on. Akito, Akiko and three other girls now all live together in this mansion as the four girls compete for Akito&#039;s affection. It has turned ito a full on harem fanservice anime and you only really have to watch the opening to get the picture. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I&#039;m not going to explain all the characters for you, Ana and Arashi are mostly the same as they were in the book (that is to say, fanservice characters) only a whole hell of a lot less subtle about it. The anime also completely omits the family politics thing that kinda gave Ana and Asrashi a good reason to be here, so pretty much just fanservice.<br />
<br />
Akiko is fairly well depicted though they cut a lot of her best dialogue short. Akito is beautifully depicted, though he narrated the novels so of course a lot of his best stuff had to be cut out. But they actually added in a bunch of great dialogue for him so I won&#039;t complain<br />
<br />
It&#039;s Ginbei that really gets my goat. In the novels, I loved Ginbei, especially her downright eloquent phone conversations with Akito. And in the anime we skip over all those phone conversations and she&#039;s a Tsundere. You will notice, Ginbei is not mentioned among the characters and voice actors above, and that is right. For me, there is no Ginbei in most of this series.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Still, I have to say, there are a lot of good bits to this anime. The first episode, the beginning of the second episode. The flashback episode (Akito was already a goddamn hero when he was just ten years old). There a little snippet when Akito is sick that&#039;s definitely worth watching. It&#039;s just great to see some of these scenes depicted on screen. They do take certain scenes from the novels and throw them around here and there without screwing up the dialogue too much and those scenes are genuinely pretty good. Even some of the added scenes, like Psudo-Ginbei&#039;s moe shtick with the kitten, are pretty darn decent. This is one of those animes which are honestly painful for me to watch from beginning to end, but now that I&#039;ve finished watching it, I go back to it all the time just to watch an episode or a scene that I just can&#039;t get out of my head. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if I can recommend it. I give it a four because I think maybe four tenths of the series are worth watching and re-watching. iIf you&#039;re not cool with incest, there isn&#039;t any but you&#039;ll probably want to skip this anyway. If you like incest romances at all, go read the novels, or at least the volumes that were translated and if you like those, go ahead and watch the series.

    Onii-chan Dakedo is about Akito and his sister Akiko who were seperated after there parents died and after 6 years are reunited at the same school and live together in a co-ed dorm with 4 other girls. The story is very unique. I am yet to find another anime that I can enjoy about a sister with a brocon and her big brother just trying to protect her. <br />
<br />
Each episode consisted of Akiko flirting with her brother, the other girls objecting, and Akito turning her down. You would think that you would get bored of the fairly repetitive plot, but you don&#039;t just because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81250">
        each character. They are all so different and have a different role to play in the story.<br />
<br />
I personally was not a fan of the ending, but all together the show is amazing and I recommend that everyone watch it.

    As most harem style anime the only reason to watch it will be the ecchi or romance scenes. Since this anime doesn&#039;t contain real romance and only has &#039;showoff ecchi&#039; I can&#039;t be praising this anime at all. Since the sound and art are quite good I have something positive about this anime. But because of this I can&#039;t rate this anime that good.<br />
<br />
When we see a romance anime we always have some parts that should be filled up, they chose like most romance animes to add comedy in the anime for the fill up.<br />
<br />
Since the comedy in this anime is making fun of somebody

          <span style="display: none;" id="review110797">
        and tricking them, you might find this boring and not interesting at all. I did not like to comedy.<br />
<br />
Note: You can have a different opinion on everything I say.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
A romance story most of the time contains: Explaination of the characters or an explanation of their living situation or both in rare cases.<br />
Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! did both and that&#039;s really good of them, but the story itself isn&#039;t good at all. The explanation is really bad and show a lack of info. The living situation is so poorly explained i don&#039;t even know why he has that super large house for himself. But that is like the main place so it doesn&#039;t matter I guess. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Sweet art which shows the more friendly side of the anime. The background work is done well and the general art is decent. Nothing to complain.(7/10)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The sound pack of this anime is not really satisfying at all. The voice acting is quite good and that&#039;s it. That Could use some work, but is decent. (6/10)<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Whenever I see a romance anime it&#039;s needed to be really good and should explain a couple of things about them like: Housing, Personality, Age, Extra info and History. Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! only did the housing and age part. Which is Frigging bad. Besides that the characters are all the same. They look different and that&#039;s it. It&#039;s just horrible.(1/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Well if you love a bad character design and story with decent art &amp; sound I guess you would love this. But it&#039;s just not enjoyable and I waited out for something to happen. Nothing happened so I dropped it. With a lot of fan service and many filler I guess it might be enjoyable by some, but in general it&#039;s not really satisfying.(3/10)<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
A harem ecchi anime focusing on &#039;showoff ecchi&#039; with a bad character design and story making it not enjoyable and not recommendable to anybody.<br />

    To the near infinite cosmos reaching amount of Little Sister themed animes around this woeful world. I would like to say that this, is extraordinary.<br />
<br />
Because who the heck doesn&#039;t want a little sister that wants to marry her own blood brother?  Hmm?<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s get down to business on why this anime is worth watching to those siscons out there, and the rest of you little closet perverts around.<br />
<br />
First of all, the story is about a this guy&#039;s little sister wanting to marry him. Seems easy to solve doesn&#039;t it? Just hit her chances down and explain the World Constitutional Law on Marriage to her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145497">
        right? Nope. She&#039;s hell bent on making him marry her. Best of all she has NO INTENTION of hiding of her Bro Complex whatsoever. So some laughs guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Art is as you expected from an anime in the 21st Century. Nothing much to explain here.<br />
<br />
The Studio has done a good job on making the characters as appealing as possible. A high-artistrocat, a loli and much much more. Character-wise their actions are accordingly to their aura. In other words, what you think they will do, they will do.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but I really enjoyed watching this anime. I wouldn&#039;t mind rewatching this in a succeeding year-time or so. I probably enjoyed this because of the really new (and non cliche too) storyline and I hope for a season two also.<br />
<br />
To sum it up. Siscons, Brocons, LoliCons, rejoice! This is an anime worth of your time.<br />
<br />

    &quot;It is an ecchi, incest, disgusting harem anime.&quot;<br />
The above statement is what you get from reading the synopsis and for that reason I have come up with my own.<br />
A girl with a &#039;brother complex&#039; (note the quotation mark) finally meets her brother after 6 years. Despite his kind nature he does not seem to reciprocate her feelings. However she is not only the person who is involve with him- in fact the whole student council is. Things are even more complicated when his editor (as he is an incest {yep, incest writer} begins to wonder if he has a sister complex.<br />
Ok, now that I have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323300">
        mentioned what this is about, I will now go on to review the various aspects of this series.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10.<br />
My biggest problem with this plot is probably that it is very predictable. Just by watching the actions of the characters, you can easily tell what is going to happen at the end of the show. Another problem is that it lacks in originality- if you look at this story well, you would find that a lot of anime&#039;s have almost the same plot. In spite of all its negativity, this story is well plotted, well structured and the characters action actually matches their backstory.Oh one more thing: It has an extremely predictable (to me) plot twist.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10.<br />
I am not really into judging arts, but I have not seen anything that was horrible or extremely good in this anime.<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10.<br />
Just like the story, the characters lack originality- There is the really hot and horny one, the tsundere type one, the shy but helpful one, and lastly the childish but loving one. They all sound familiar, am I correct? <br />
Despite this lack of originality, all of the characters are humorous in their own different ways- they all try their best to make their loved one happy. In addition to all of this, the characters actions match perfectly with their backstory- I am excluding the student council president as her backstory is untold. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10.<br />
When it comes to this aspect, I am a hard one to please. I had already foreseen the ending from the second episode, so I can&#039;t really say that I had as much enjoyment as one who did not. Nevertheless, the comedy in this show was great- it had me cracking many times. Also most of the characters -especially the main one- are really enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10.<br />
I would give this anime the score above, because that is what it truly deserves. I actually planned to give it less, but after reviewing my score to most of the other aspects I found that a seven would be by far the most suiting.<br />
<br />
<br />

    I was hoping to watch a nice BrotherXSister that would ENTERTAIN me, but it failed to do even that. However, I could enjoy at least SOME of the characters. Honestly, the only character that I could enjoy was Nasuhara. Everything was extremely boring, waaaaayyyyyyy too much talking and literally next to NOTHING would go on in each episode. I couldn&#039;t even finish the whole thing. I got up to episode 4 and completely stopped. I do not recommend this garbage.  <br />
The animation was fine, but I think that&#039;s about it. I liked the intro song and the animation for the intro, but other than
