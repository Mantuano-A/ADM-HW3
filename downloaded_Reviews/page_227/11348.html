    I&#039;m writing this review to let out my frustrations just shortly after watching it. Sorry if I appear overly critical. There will be spoilers.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg Priority is a show that I was never the biggest fan of. Its premise was interesting but its execution left much to be desired. After watching episode 12, I was incredibly confused and concerned as to how just one additional episode would be enough to wrap up everything that was introduced in a satisfying way. <br />
<br />
And of course, half of the special is a recap. I already thought it was pretty ridiculous for a 13 episode series to have just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405610">
        one recap, but two? I lacked faith that all of the plot points and conflicts introduced near the very end of the series could be concluded in the initially believed 40 minute runtime, and upon learning that the new content would be the length of a normal episode, my little hope was lost. <br />
<br />
And I wasn&#039;t exactly incorrect. This episode didn&#039;t conclude the story. It didn&#039;t conclude anything. It instead left me with even more questions than I had previously, with a clear bait for a continuation that may or may not happen. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure how to accurately describe it, but the entire episode almost felt like a fever dream. Things happened and scenes went by, and yet by the end it felt like hardly anything had happened at all. Very vague &quot;explanations&quot; for things were randomly thrown at the characters because hey, where else are you going to put them?<br />
<br />
It introduces a new conflict over halfway through the episode and then doesn&#039;t do anything with it, and nor does it go anywhere with all the previous characters the show randomly threw in. The Accas and Frill are hardly even in the episode, to where I even forgot they existed. <br />
<br />
The entirety of this episode just feels disconnected from not only the one before it, but the entire series. Rika&#039;s desire for revenge is quickly &quot;resolved&quot; and forgotten about. Momoe is apparently fine enough to be friendly toward the others again despite saying in episode 12 that she wishes that she hadn&#039;t gotten involved with Ai and the others. Neiru is gone for practically all of it, and Ai just randomly transfers schools at the very end. It crams in a flashback and her suddenly deciding to see Neiru again after an unnecessary timeskip. <br />
<br />
I just didn&#039;t understand why any of this was happening. Momoe never appears again after the karaoke scene, and the last we see of Rika is her breaking down and showing many signs of contemplating suicide. Ai threw her phone when Neiru called her for no reason other than she didn&#039;t want to talk to her, and then she basically abandoned her friends. Rika had just vented about the loss of her friends, and then Ai leaves, too. Epic. By the very end, the status of all of the main cast except for Ai is unknown.<br />
<br />
Whether this gets a continuation or not, this was a really unsatisfying and frustrating episode. It didn&#039;t answer much of anything, and still managed to disappoint me even when my expectations were extremely low. I understand the reasons for the delay in-between episode 12 and the special, but that doesn&#039;t make me feel any better with how un-worth it the wait for this feels like.

    MINOR SPOILER at the very end of my review.<br />
<br />
I loved the first 12 episodes of Wonder Egg Priority. Sure it got messy towards the end, sparring from horrible staff conditions and meeting deadlines, but I enjoyed basically everything about it. Hearing that they need time to get out a 13th (and potentially, final) episode out was not a huge deal. They can wrap up what they&#039;ve done right?<br />
<br />
I ... I don&#039;t know man.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mind the recap. I know a ton of people will give them crap for it, but I enjoyed seeing all the girl&#039;s stories again, whatever.<br />
<br />
The rest though...<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give them credit, they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405604">
        *really* went off the deep end, and said screw it what&#039;s better than a deep end? A DEEPER END!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to discuss what happened in this episode without basically spoiling the entire thing, but I&#039;ll try to wrap my opinions up nicely.<br />
<br />
Going into this I thought we were going to get an hour long special wrapping up what eps 10-12 of WEP threw on us, and we&#039;d get something fairly good. I wasn&#039;t expecting it to be the best thing ever, given the staff problems and everything.<br />
<br />
What we got was more plot points. More loose ends. More... everything. Some things were.. resolved? It&#039;s hard to say honestly. I get what they did, but it&#039;s weird how they did it. I liked most of what they introduced. I think what&#039;s going to leave everyone sour is that they did this in something people presumed as the finale (and it might just be).<br />
<br />
If this is how Wonder Egg Priority ends, I will be disappointed. I love the girls, I love the world, but my heart will ache for a worthy conclusion.<br />
<br />
Given how it *did* end, however, I&#039;m hopeful (copium) that we&#039;ll get something to wrap this up nicely. Who knows. I could totally see me changing my opinions on this special if they did.

    The last leg for the Wonder Egg series was logistically horrifying. Introducing and attempting to develop an entirely new antagonist in Frill, which changed the agenda of our protagonists, and setting up a final confrontation all in the span of a few episodes was an abysmal idea. Unfortunately, production issues and poor time management lead to the inclusion of a recap episode, and it seemingly appeared that the narrative was expanding without an end goal, all while still stumbling towards the finish line. Though culminating as unfinished, Cloverworks advertised a special episode that promised to conclude the story satisfyingly. An expectation of a grand battle

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405732">
        comprising the lovingly crafted animation in a feature-length episode had many cautiously optimistic. Though in typical Cloverworks fashion, anticipation plummeted almost immediately when the episode started. The egregious levels of ineptitude were inevitable, weren&#039;t they?<br />
<br />
*This review contains some spoilers, though being as uneventful and disappointing as it is, there is not much to spoil*.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg Special, titled: My Priority&#039;, begins at approximately the Twenty-five-minute mark after an extensive recap haphazardly summarising events occurring after the first recap and infuriatingly preceding it as well. Advertised as an hour-long episode, though it was merely 20 minutes once all elements were accounted for, this is a frustrating use of deceptive marketing to entice the viewer and implied something far grander than the result. &#039;My Priority&#039; was not the feature-length episode Cloverworks advertised; It is merely the original finale that they failed to animate. It is plausible to have ungraciously accepted the deceit if the new material provided a satisfyingly profound conclusion; what we got was the complete opposite.<br />
<br />
Narratively, this was purely disheartening. Introducing an abundance of new plot elements without reason and ending others without depiction, &#039;My Priority&#039; is a whirlwind of nonsense. This finale is far more concerned with expanding upon its theming of self-gratification than it is with satisfactorily concluding the story. When Wonder Egg Priority ended, most central characters were left wallowing in a depressive state, realizing their tribulations were for nothing. That is, except for Ai; Declaring herself as a Warrior of Eros to fight against Thanatos, a symbolic declaration for the Freudian view of mental stillness and the need to process and synthesize information relating to trauma. Concluding the Eros/Thanatos theming by displaying the characters&#039; acceptance that the ones they have lost are, in essence, forever unattainable. While the suicide victims have returned, albeit, in a parallel-universe form, their distinctly new persona refuses to associate with our protagonists. Realizing their attempts as saviours were for naught, they seemingly distance themselves from the Wonder Eggs. Whether they have overcome their own self-loathing, grief, and turmoil is unclear, but their acceptance of such aggrievances once existing in their past are made fundamentally clear as they slowly drift apart, forming a life seated in normalcy. Their fundamental drive to help others has diminished as they begin to put their satisfaction and happiness first, hence &#039;My Priority.&#039;<br />
<br />
Forgoing a structural conclusion in place of a thematic one would not automatically be an outright disaster. In a reminiscent way, the concluding episodes of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series depicted a visceral and feverish manifestation of trauma, human psychology, and introspective journeys yet failed to end the story. In essence, it shares sparse similarities in prose and design and prioritizes expressing character tenets and reactionary decisions to the preceding distressing events. They are, however, incomparable. Beneath the objective of rescuing the deceased, the implicit intentions were to have the girls accept and process their grievance, to move on. Though the episode revealed the change, the development required to demonstrate the transitioning character ideologies as valid was rushed or non-existent; It jumps to the conclusion without any visual development, rendering such progress unrealistic and stupid. It depicts pseudo-intellectual snobbery at its finest.<br />
<br />
The nonsensical narrative steadily continues throughout the limited runtime. Once the disappointing episode ungraciously concludes, there are, at minimum, a dozen answered plot points. The inclusion of Frill is practically reduced to a device to direct the cast towards the intended conclusion; Everything involving her and the &#039;temptation of death&#039; is frustratingly and purposely left obscured and entirely interpretable or completely unnecessary. Neiru&#039;s narrative is fragmentary, unsatisfying, and, from a pessimistic viewpoint, a gateway to a hypothetical sequel with a blatantly ham-fisted goal that Ai can strive to grasp. However, the end-card outright denies any sequel meaning the concluding message of the Wonder Egg anime is: Ai realizes her friends are important to her. What a load of hogwash; the concept had already been made abundantly clear and depicted pseudo-intellectual snobbery at its finest.<br />
<br />
One looming merit is that the awkward use of heavy-handed symbolism to illustrate its thematic was almost non-existent. The only instance that struck as painstakingly obvious was the use of characters walking in place, representing the theming of being trapped in their unwavering ideologies. On the other hand, the strict deadlines imposed upon the animators could hypothetically result in such a striking animated flaw. Visually, it is noticeably subdued compared to the prequel. The loud, vibrant colour palette, the ridiculously monstrous antagonistic designs, franticly flowing animation, and glaring CG issues are absent here. Photo-realistic backgrounds shown throughout were welcoming even if the cast interacts poorly with them. Infrequently sloppy animation features un-synced dialogue mouth movements and significantly reduced mobility in general, unlike the explosive battles seen early in WEP.<br />
<br />
Less so a catastrophic failure, but more so a sad whimper; A synthesis and personification of all the unsavoury aspects and worst qualities in the series, an incoherent story introducing an abundance of plot holes opposing the original narrative. So, where does the blame lie? Is this utter failure of an episode due to Cloverworks&#039; incompetency, their embarrassing management of an inexperienced team, the creative voices directing the project, or does it lie with the faulted anime industry? The system is broken; with Aniplex imposing strict deadlines, insufficient funding, and harsh working conditions, many anime in the current landscape begin showing cracks in the back half of the season, and Wonder Egg Priority was no exception. Though depicting some genuinely spectacular animation and artwork in the early episodes, the final batch was a mere shadow of its admirable technical merit. &#039;My Priority&#039;s&#039; 2nd Key-animation began merely a week before the airing date; They were, yet again, working up to the crunch alongside an abundance of untrained overseas assistance to create a twenty-minute episode possessing a smidgen of the supposedly achievable visuals and featured barely animated prose. That is not to say that the fault solely lies in the technical aspects; Clear creative disagreements were present in how poorly executed the last episodes were, resulting in an incomplete and unsatisfactory narrative. I would rather watch a behind-the-scenes documentary on Cloverworks before even consider returning to or ruminating over this colossal disappointment that is the Wonder Egg franchise.<br />

Story/Plot 6/10 - Where do I even begin? The pacing was honestly way too fast, and if they didn&#039;t put that almost 30-minute re-cap in the pacing would&#039;ve been way steadier. The plot gave us more questions than answered them, the &quot;parallel worlds&quot; thing was super confusing, and we honestly didn&#039;t really learn that much. Don&#039;t get me wrong, finding out Neiru was an AI was cool and all but besides that, the only other thing I can remember us getting was &quot;closure&quot; for Koito&#039;s death. (Which wasn&#039;t really closure at all considering it made her entire death seem pointless, and also kind of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405606">
        made her seem like a down-right terrible person.) Overall, the plot seemed really rushed and it honestly just was a huge letdown.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation 10/10 - Same as the regular series, and spectacular as ever. Same with the animation.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10 - Same as the usual series.<br />
<br />
Characters/Personalities 8/10 - Now, I don&#039;t usually change the rating for personalities, but certain characters just acted off. For example, Ai made some decisions, which while I understand them I feel like she wouldn&#039;t regularly do. And yes, I do get the circumstances but I still feel like her reactions to certain things just weren&#039;t... Usual. The other 2 (Rika and Momo) acted pretty normally, but I feel like when Rika found out Neiru was an AI she would&#039;ve still tried to help her and wouldn&#039;t have blown off the idea immedietly. (Ik after that we had the scene where she started crying and stuff but I&#039;m just talking about her initial reaction.) (Neiru was also pretty normal.) Idk, I didn&#039;t go deep into their feelings like the usual series, and that kind of bothered me because that was one of the great things about the original series! (Again, they were still great characters but I feel like certain key things weren&#039;t focused on enough when it came to their personalities and emotions.)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall 6/10 - I don&#039;t have much to say about this. It was a letdown on many parts, I still enjoyed it for the most part because it&#039;s &quot;Wonder Egg Priority&quot; but I was also super bothered by the plot and the other stuff I mentioned. :)

    Okay... I&#039;m gonna try to be sincere. As a Finale, I like it. It&#039;s an open one, but it&#039;s cool. What is the problem that got many people mad? <br />
<br />
The fact that we got to wait 3 months for just 20 minutes of recap and 20 minutes of a new episode. I myself was just mad too by this. But, letting that aside, it a great end for the show that makes you want a Second Season.<br />
 <br />
I really think if they just didn&#039;t make us wait 3 months for this, everyone would have liked it. The revelations in this chapter were pretty nice and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405709">
        they resolve some things in the plot, but the things like fightint Frill or becoming and Eros Warrior aren&#039;t touched at all. And it&#039;s because of that that I think it should have a second season. So, please, if you watch it, try turning aside the fact that you have to wait 3 months and be more critical, because it isn&#039;t that bad. And if you didn&#039;t watched Wonder Egg Priority, watch it, it&#039;s very good.

    *spoilers for Wonder Egg Priority and this dumpster fire of a finale special*<br />
<br />
After its production troubles came to light around the time the show had to shove a recap episode into its 12 episode slot, fans privy to these troubles became concerned. As new pieces of information came to light, both within the show, and behind the scenes, everyone wondered just how the show could possibly wrap itself up. There were just too many loose-ends for one special to handle, but there wasn’t enough to truly justify a continuation. Alas, CloverWorks announced a special episode titled “My Priority”, which would seemingly conclude the series.<br />
<br />
3 months

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406672">
        went by and the most common reaction seems to be something along the lines of “what the hell is this?!”<br />
<br />
Contextually speaking, there is a mild sense of guilt in calling this finale vile, pathetic, and a complete invalidation of the series it was seemingly made to conclude. After all, such a statement ignores all of the passion and misery that went into the show’s notoriously troubled production and the months the staff at CloverWorks spent on this last episode following the TV run’s conclusion. However, it honestly must be said. This finale should have never come to pass. If this was what they originally planned before it got delayed, one really must ask “why”?<br />
<br />
Was this all some cruel joke? Were we meant to be taken along for a ride only to be met with the most mean-spirited, unsatisfying wet fart of a conclusion possible? Was this meant to challenge, even punish the audience in some way before the delay made the eventual tragedy all the more maddening and demoralizing? Why else would the writer, series director, and other staff members make some of the decisions they did?<br />
<br />
Why else would 25 out of the 46 minutes this finale special takes up, be nothing but recap after episode 8 was already turned into one? Why else would they have a ton of new, interesting music, including a nice insert song, and place almost all of it during the recap? Why else would they go so far to provide the most asinine, mean-spirited, series-invalidating reveals while largely sidestepping the main plot for the sake of a bait &amp; switch plus an embarrassing sequel hook? It’s genuinely so difficult to comprehend why any of this was done in the 3 months since the TV broadcast concluded or how much of this was the plan all along because it’s so legitimately fucked that it’s easy to make up accusatory conspiracies on the matter.<br />
<br />
Speaking of so legitimately fucked, let&#039;s discuss the truth about Koito, Ai&#039;s friend who seemingly committed suicide. In the series, they did show snippets of the two in weird and uncomfortable situations regarding the enigmatic Koito getting bullied, as well as a moment where she’s crying in AI’s teacher&#039;s arms. At some point, Ai’s friends throw around the possibility that she wasn&#039;t a true friend. The series kinda sorta confirms this with Koito being weirded out that Ai would act so close when she doesn’t consider them friends,  now that she’s been revived. There’s an explanation for this later that we will get to, but we have more pressing matters on our hands because after AI is distraught and she runs away, we learn what truly happened. Brace yourself because frankly, this is all kinds of revolting.<br />
<br />
It turns out that Koito was a serial suicide baiter that actually got a teacher, a father with kids, to kill himself. She attempted to do the same to Ai’s teacher, except it didn’t work and she lashed out upon a romance rejection that led to this, saying several things, up to and including a false rape accusation. At some point, when no one was looking, she slipped and fell to her doom.<br />
<br />
Just like that, the entire series has been invalidated and it’s now important that you avoid Wonder Egg Priority at all costs! <br />
<br />
As if the 25 minutes of recap wasn’t bad enough, this one singular moment automatically dismantles any goodwill left towards this series. The ultimate mystery of WEP, why Koito killed herself, got the worst resolution possible that invalidates why we’re even following Ai to begin with. First off, why is Koito so hell-bent on making people kill themselves? No one knows, unless spurned teacher love is all it takes, which...what the fuck? How much does it sting knowing that the only reason AI didn’t kill herself was because the existence of a being as vile and insipid as this came into her life, and that she spent so long trying to see what her thought process behind committing self-death was? On a scale of 1 to 10, 13. Does the show do A SINGLE GODDAMN THING WITH THIS REVELATION?! <br />
<br />
NO! ARE YOU STUPID?! THIS IS WONDER EGG FUCKING PRIORITY! WE DON’T DO ANYTHING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OR ADVANCE CONCEPTS AND THEMES HERE!<br />
<br />
Not once does Ai ruminate on this or have it affect her. Not once does the show moralize about how sometimes shitty people can end up saving you or whatever, because this isn’t even important to the episode moving forward. Keep in mind that at this point, neither parallel universe Ai’s suicide nor Koito’s were caused by the extreme bullying they received. Sure, this breaks the rules for how the suicide statue people work, but at this point, there’s no merit going over the plotholes and inconsistencies. We move on from this mean-spirited dumpster fire that feels like it’s gaslighting both the audience and Ai, before she learns that apparently Neiru doesn’t know her either, except that’s her revived sister who looks similar.<br />
<br />
The truth is, just because you save them doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily remember you, let alone what happened. Reality shifts for some reason, probably to avoid the revived people from having to come to terms with having died and coming back because fuck doing anything interesting. This is meant to be of some relief to Ai when Momoe and Rika tell her this, which she’s gonna need for when Neiru’s secretary --who is now good again and no longer evil like the end of episode 9 suggested-- reveals that Neiru managed to create something that records her dreams. The girls learn that in it, she revived her sister and was visited by one of the insect-head goons, and said lackey offers her a chance to join Frill, for Neiru, too, is an Ai. <br />
<br />
We did learn that Neiru was born through artificial insemination, but that’s not quite the same as this out of nowhere thing that doesn’t explain her direct and logic-based outlook anymore than what we already got in the show. We didn&#039;t need this. It’s just there to explain why she gave her pet to Ai to look after and why she was gonna disappear from the show afterwards outside of one phone call that Ai ignores and immediately regrets.<br />
<br />
There is one decent scene where Ai and Rika discuss the fear of death, but in the sea of nonsensical, mean-spirited horseshit, gaslighting, backpedaling, and stupid reveals that largely ignore the main plot, it means naught. The girls all drift apart, Ai goes to another school, then she comes back in the hopes of becoming a Warrior of Eros and getting the gang back together to defeat Frill, presumably in a season 2 that will largely never happen because this ending was a dumpster fire everyone waited 3 months for after the show ended on an already terrible note following a nightmarish production.<br />
<br />
What a dire, insipid wet fart of an ending, this was. Imagine waiting 3 months for this, thinking that the show might find a way to conclude in 46 minutes. Even the visuals are far less polished compared to the rest of the series. There’s little in the way of decent animation and there’s only one or two remotely noteworthy shots. The backgrounds and character models are less polished, and very little of the new music introduced gets put in the actual new scenes for this special. Barring the passable audiovisuals, this was a miserable, demoralizing finale. Foresight wasn’t even a factor regarding this anime, was it? <br />
<br />
It hurts to be this venomous towards a show knowing how much better it once was and how notoriously awful the production side of things became. One can only hope that Shin Wakabayashi and his team at CloverWorks are able to get some semblance of rest. Still, the worst thing an ending can do is be so vile and useless that it poisons the very essence of the series. It’s not fun feeling contempt and resentment towards a show you were enjoying in its early stages. Now, if this somehow gets that continuation it desperately craves, there won’t be that same goodwill that was had going into the show.<br />
<br />
If there was ever a reason to avoid Wonder Egg Priority, this finale special might be the most damning one of all.

    Edit: I blame CW and Aniplex for their dreadful production. If anyone who may see this considers blaming the staff, it isn&#039;t their fault, blame the directors and cash hungry producers for this.<br />
<br />
I am so pissed off and offended with this horrendous joke of an ending to what could have been a fantastic anime.<br />
<br />
I really wish CloverWorks put as much thought and care into making this part of the show as they did for the rest of the anime. The first 12 episodes were absolutely stunning in direction and art, with fantastic music and the characters were really relatable with a story (up to episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405683">
        10) that people could relate to. Now, 3 months later, we have the final episode. To say it was good would be a lie, because while it was nice to see the cast again, that was as far as my enjoyment went with this.<br />
<br />
The story literally got ruined, and I don&#039;t know how they did it to this extent. The main plot line got completely dropped in favour of adding something else that made zero sense. It felt like they skipped like 6 essential episodes that could have made so much more sense. The pacing was way too fast, random things just happened, and their cheap excuses of explanations went absolutely nowhere.<br />
<br />
The characters as well. I&#039;m going to be very vague here because part of the reason the story was ruined was because the new plot line is related to them. But in general, they were so inconsistent, and it was so frustrating and annoying to watch them be so different. All the characters were completely different for no reason, one even literally got erased, again, for no reason.<br />
<br />
There won&#039;t be a S2. Nothing in this will be explained, and it&#039;s so frustrating. I wanted to see a good conclusion, something like Madoka but with a lot more impact. All I got was a cash grab that left more questions than answers.<br />
<br />
I wish it had never come to this.

    This is my first time writing a MAL review. I’ll keep it short, as there isn’t really much to say about this finale.<br />
<br />
Wonder Egg Priority initially caught many anime-watchers by surprise with its immediately engaging and gripping plot and ideas. For such a large season, being filled with big name sequels and adaptations, Wonder Egg Priority fell under the radar for a short while, later to be called one of the best recent originals in anime.<br />
<br />
 As for me, I absolutely loved this show. I loved the characters, the plot, music, art, psychological horror, and short CGDCT elements all alike. Representation of touchy and taboo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405614">
        subjects that are normally untouched in anime are dealt with quite well here and it’s commendable how fluid it feels in the story<br />
<br />
The first 10 episodes of this show really showed promise, and it felt like everyone was interested to see how it was going to conclude. Despite production issues, the general quality of the show never faded, that was until episode 11.<br />
<br />
Episode 11, 12, and now 13, talk about a huge ass middle finger to your fans. That might be a bit too harsh, but that’s how it feels to watch these episodes and I can no longer really recommend this show to anyone I respect.<br />
<br />
What these episodes did was take everything they set up and added so many new, confusing things that were never hinted at in the entirety of the show, especially regarding Koito, Ai’s main interest in the series. <br />
<br />
The finale itself spends its first half recapping the anime, making this 12 episode anime with 2 entire 20min+ recaps, which is absolutely insane and unneeded. It’s not like the plot is extremely hard to follow (atleast until now.)<br />
<br />
Overall, this finale did nothing but create more questions and its genuinely not worth watching if this is truly the end for WEP.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Story - 6/10. For a story so promising in the beginning, it sucks that 6 is the highest I can give it, but all its potential was ruined so bad.<br />
<br />
Art - 10/10, easily CloverWork’s most visually appealing work to this day. I personally don’t think any other anime of their’s comes close to this.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8/10. The OST is great. It feels easygoing, but not so much as a slice of life OST would. Songs in the finale feel so out of place, though. It’s really weird.<br />
<br />
Character - 6/10, Not a single character in this show feels fleshed out or complete. Each development feels like a fragment of a character with no connector<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 4/10, this finale was honestly quite boring as it feels so disconnected with what the initial show made itself seem like<br />
<br />
Overall - 6/10.

    I see many people complaining about the special and how it didn&#039;t wrap anything up but I think that was the goal. WEP was hugely successful so it would only make sense they would want you to want 2nd season, and the special did that. After the ending my interest in getting another season suddenly came back. The ending accomplished what it wanted and was never meant to be a final conclusion. <br />
<br />
I personally loved the 1st season and this special made me want a 2nd season and made me remember why I loved WEP, because of how over the top, dark, and complex it

    I am in very great pain. <br />
<br />
The first 7-8 episodes were absolutely fantastic. 10/10.<br />
<br />
But after the tonal whiplash they did and went over-ambitious during the final stretch of the show, it all went downhill. <br />
<br />
This special was only 21 minutes. The other 25 was a recap. Was the 21 minutes good? Hell no.<br />
<br />
Characters did not get a resolution. Mysteries (a lot) left unsolved. Janky animations in some cuts. Story? What story? It was twist after twist, reveal after reveal, and nothing happened. <br />
<br />
To clarify, we spent the first few minutes totally confused at what&#039;s happening, until clarified later. Then, through a series of awkward encounters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406012">
        with oddly awkward dialogue between the characters, we continue to cut the cast down to...eventually...have another lackluster encounter. The intense emotions that Ai goes through doesn&#039;t feel natural at all. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the character acting is great here, and some shots were genuinely great, but overall the net is negative. <br />
<br />
Everyone is sad, but we don&#039;t have time to process the events that led them here. No time to process what happened at the end of the last episode. No time to give anyone a proper end to their arc. <br />
<br />
Worst of all, the leave us off on a hopeful note, wow, Ai is back baby, let&#039;s go, cut to the ending song, how cute, ends with a beautiful shot of the girls together, smiling, as they say in unison, &quot;The end!&quot;, what a happy ending! PISS OFF, NOTHING WAS ANSWERED, EVERYTHING WAS CONFUSING, AND I AM IN PAIN.<br />
<br />
-10/10 I now will pretend that the show ended halfway through the main show thanks

    Wonder Egg Priority is a special show, it has passion and vision and isn&#039;t just a cheap cash grab isekai or some other low tier trash. Is it perfect? No, but what is there is incredibly solid and it greatly saddens me to see the series end up like this.<br />
<br />
No, I&#039;m not talking about the special itself being the worst thing ever, I mean this stupid backlash against it. <br />
<br />
First of all, every single complaint of &quot;why does it have TWO recaps&quot; is missing reality and is such a shallow reaction I wonder if these posts and reviews even cared about the show to begin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405798">
        with! they ran into production issues and had to delay the final episode, thus the first recap, this second recap section is because it&#039;s been three months since it aired, come on people use your brains this is literally not a problem you just made it into one for no reason, karekano has like 6 recaps that doesn&#039;t make the show bad! <br />
<br />
Second, anybody expecting a bombastic conclusion where they go in and kill god should go back to shounen anime. Yeah, there were flashy action scenes in this show, but this show is not ABOUT action, it&#039;s about the characters, and every complaint I&#039;m seeing about this special is that it didn&#039;t explain anything and left things open when this show has always been intentionally vague about things? You can&#039;t have it both ways, the top review right now on the main show complains the show explains too much, now it&#039;s bad that it didn&#039;t explain things?<br />
<br />
The rest of the whining really comes off like people just didn&#039;t pay attention to the series and then got confused because they missed the themes, and it saddens me that so many people are expressing the sentiment that they won&#039;t watch it just because the ending was bad. I don&#039;t think the ending was bad, but also, there&#039;s more to a work than just the ending guys! come on, is one episode out of 12 more important than the rest of them just because it&#039;s the last one?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not the destination, but the journey that matters? ever heard this?

    It pains me to write this, but the finale of Wonder Egg Priority serves not as a satisfying conclusion to the story of the series, but rather the death knell of the production problems that plagued it and the industry in general.<br />
<br />
First off, the opening 25 minutes are recap and not worth discussing. The second half is clumsy in its execution at best - full of awkward pauses, editing errors, rushed compositing and stunted pacing, it&#039;s painfully obvious the staff still did not have enough time to put the kind of polish on this episode that was present in the beginning of the series and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405634">
        slowly deteriorated over time.<br />
<br />
Story issues aside, I put no blame on the fate of WEP in the hands of the hard-working animation staff that spent years putting this together. Many of them are young and have shown incredible potential and dedication in what they accomplished on this series. They did the best they could with the time they had, and I wish them nothing but the best. Overambition may have factored in to this series tripping over itself, but what went wrong during WEP&#039;s production are symptoms of much larger problems that have afflicted the industry as a whole for many years. Only now are many coming to understand just how overworked and strained for time anime staff are, and for those interested in how it affected WEP I recommend reading Sakugablog&#039;s &quot;TV Anime, A Deadly Landscape&quot; and both &quot;Wonder Egg Priority Production Notes&quot; by kViN, which highlight the people behind the series and the struggles they faced.<br />
<br />
As for the meat of the story behind this final episode, one has to wonder if this is the ending that was planned from the beginning. It seems unlikely given how unsatisfying the conclusion is, and how many loose threads were left untied. The wonderful friendship of the 4 main girls withers away with uninterest, empty platitudes and half-baked expository dialogue. At the end, we are left with an open-ended conclusion that one would normally assume to be a hint at a 2nd season - but the likelihood of that considering how we got here in the first place is next to nothing.<br />
<br />
All I have left to say is that I am not angry, but disappointed. Disappointed that such a promising and stand-out series with an admirable amount of passion poured in to it ended up this way. Disappointed for the fans who were holding out, hoping it would stick the landing. Disappointed for the staffers, who worked so hard to push the boundaries of what is possible in the absolutely chaotic and unforgiving world of the anime industry. And disappointed that not only have things not gotten better for them, but continue to get worse.<br />
<br />
This whole series has left a sour taste in my mouth. I take no pleasure in saying that I cannot recommend it, because all it does for me is build up to nothing of consequence. I hope things don&#039;t end here for WEP, but it seems that they do. <br />
<br />
3/10 for the OVA, 6/10 for the series overall.

    All I can say is.... I am confused. *Spoiler warning*<br />
<br />
 Making the storyline more complicated than it already kind of is, especially from the last few episodes of the season, I still don&#039;t really understand Frill, Aca and Ura-aca&#039;s motivations and goals at all. And now even more confused with what they did during this special. Maybe its just me who doesn&#039;t understand but it really seems like they are overcomplicating the plot.<br />
<br />
I do hope they release a season 2, but where it currently stands the story line is just gettung a bit too confusing and all over the place for me.

    ….yikes<br />
<br />
Now before I get into the details, I want to address that I do not blame the staff that worked on Wonder Egg Priority for the quality of this special. CloverWorks overworked their staff (some to the point of hospitalization), &amp; thus they are truly at fault. At the time of writing this review they still have yet to event make a statement about the absurd working conditions.<br />
<br />
As for the content of the special itself…what a disappointment. Coming into this special, I was hoping to get answers. WEP ended with quite the twist in the last few episodes, and gave the viewer no resolution. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405800">
        special was the chance to tie up those loose ends and provide an actual ending. Instead, what we got was approximately 30 minutes of recap and then an ending that only gave the viewers more questions.<br />
<br />
While I am not necessarily opposed to the premise of recaps, the fact that half of this special is a recap for a 13 episode series (that already had a recap episode, mind you) is absurd. Had the recap been it’s own separate entity or had the special not been advertised as something new, I would not have had such an adverse opinion to this.<br />
<br />
Approximately 25 minutes after starting this special, we finally get through the recap portion and reach what we have been waiting months for - some actual resolution. Or that’s what we’d get if this special made any sense. Nothing from before is answered, the characters act inconsistently with what you’d expect, and again we are left hanging and somehow more confused than previously.<br />
<br />
Overall, the Wonder Egg Priority Special is just plain bad &amp; I cannot in my right mind recommend this to anyone. Half is a recap, we AGAIN are left with more questions than answers, and - to my surprise - the plot got even dumber than the last 3 episodes of the series did. WEP started off with an interesting premise and beautiful art (which, granted, looks just as good in this special), but hopped on the crazy train in the last few episodes and kept going full-steam ahead for this special as well.

    It is not that bad. <br />
Just whole ratings is based on dissapointment of half of this special is actually recap.<br />
i hope someone who will voice over will manage it to cut by half.<br />
<br />
I think this ova will actually help to people that will be watching this series in the future and they will have less dissapointment by watching 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
cons<br />
-half of episode is recap<br />
-contains kind of premise for next season.<br />
<br />
pros <br />
-the show get actual 12 episode now.<br />
-we can wait second season<br />
<br />
if you don&#039;t understand parallel worlds concept - think about it like a timelines. it would be much clear.<br />
<br />
Overall the episode isnt stressful. but if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405947">
        you cut the silly overcap it just fits the 12th episode to the show.  It doesnt worth hate it gets. I hope you will just watch it right after watching 11 previous episodes.

    alright, i got lots of stuff to say. first off, is that this anime is truly a strange experience, it&#039;s something different than anything else i have watched. i genuenly love it but there&#039;s stuff that i don&#039;t like about it. it feels rushed but storyline and characters are very good, i wish there were more animes like this one. the whole idea of wep project is awesome. however this special episode was supposed to answer all the frequently asked questions, but it left me - and i&#039;m sure a lot of other people with even more questions than the actual answers. i&#039;m very confused

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406078">
        about how neiru is an AI and it made me really dissapointed to find out it was her younger sister and how neiru is now the one in their dream egg world. and also that neiru is missing? and none of the main four girls remember each other after completing their missions made me so sad, and nobody remembers anything at this point. this ending kinda ruined the whole show. well, at least i thought this was the ending, which is most likely true, but it would be quite dissapointing to just leave it here, with so many unfinished and unexplained things and half of the 46 minute episode was just a recap, but if i remember correctly we had a recap at episode 8? we probably won&#039;t get a second season because in the animators&#039; eyes it&#039;s most likely a finished story, but i hope we would get one where they all meet up and neiru isn&#039;t really an AI because that was really dissapointing. this was a great idea but poorly executed, this anime really could&#039;ve been something. as i said a bit earlier i wish we would get a second season, because it can&#039;t end at &quot;i want to see neiru but she probably doesn&#039;t want to see me&quot;. but if this really is the end, i will really miss this anime and everything about it.

    I&#039;m gonna preface this with my rating is very dependent if this is the conclusion of WEP or not. If this was used as a season finale cliff hanger it is a good one because it brings in a lot of new concepts and issues that need to be addressed.  I honestly think if this is a season finale episode with a promise of a new season this was a good ep.<br />
<br />
However nothing is confirmed and we have no idea if this is how WEP will end. If this is the final thing we see from WEP it would be extremly underwhelming and I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405630">
        would rate it 5-6/10 however considering the writing of the series so far there was a lot other conflicts that were introduced early in the series that have been developed but not completely answered. So with this more build I think there is enough to see a second and if so i think this was a good ep otherwise extremely disappointing

    I won&#039;t write much since i think it&#039;s not necessary, just like this special. <br />
It was meant to be a conclusion to the Wonder Egg Priority franchise, yet it didn&#039;t conclude anything. <br />
<br />
This special consists of a recap which was really nice, since it&#039;s been some time since we saw the girls on the screen and the so-called conclusion.<br />
As i&#039;m not against the recap part, since it was just a normal recap, i&#039;m just dissappointed with the second part. <br />
Everything felt out of touch. The transitions between scenes were really weird especially around the karaoke scene. It was really confusing. <br />
The characters also felt really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406016">
        different. Momoe, despite her saying that she wished that she never got involved in the case, now is perfectly fine with the other girls.<br />
We don&#039;t even have enough screentime for one of the most important characters in the show, which are Acca, Ura-Acca and Frill. It&#039;s awful.<br />
<br />
To be honest, i&#039;m not really sure what to think of this special. It was just unecessary and i honestly think of it as an alternative line of ending.<br />
I definitly don&#039;t reccomend you to watch it<br />

    why? just, WHY? I&#039;m seriously intrigued to why they decided this was a okay ending for this beautiful (until the 12th) episode. its really confusing, and when they explain the plot holes made by the ova, they explain in a poorly way.<br />
<br />
About the animation, well we all knew the poor situation the studio were in but i dont get it, they had this 2-3 month break, to release something worse than the things they were making when overworking, i just didn&#039;t get the point.<br />
<br />
EDIT: i forgot to mention that the 2-3 month break was for the staff to take care of their mental health but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405866">
        still a pretty damn long time<br />
<br />
just stop on the 12th episode, thats a better ending tbh.<br />
<br />
i&#039;m glad that this has a separate rating than the anime itself, it was the only good thing about it, no cap.<br />
<br />
