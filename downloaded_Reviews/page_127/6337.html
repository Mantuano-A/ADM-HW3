    Assault Lily Bouquet is an enjoyable story, but its enjoyment could run hollow. <br />
<br />
The story follows Riri Hitotsuyanagi, a new &quot;Lily&quot; student that joined the school to follow the person that saved her, Yuyu Shirai. However, the story is more complicated than that; we need to understand the concept of Lily, Charm, Huge, Garden, Rare Skill, Legions, Schutzangel, and that part is where the plot becomes messy. <br />
<br />
One of the most significant flaws in the series is the amount of information handled during the plot. These defects not only creates chaos, but they also affect the story with unnecessary threads. We can appreciate these defects

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369646">
        with the characters. They keep introducing characters every time without a proper background or need. I have been trying to find a good explanation, and my conclusion is Assault Lily Bouquet is just a prelude that introduces the setting of the incoming game that will be launch in January 2021. That reason explains the need to add condensed information in only twelve episodes. Despite these problems, the series can be enjoyable if you spend some time understanding the plot. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the best, most exciting, and most poetic part of Assault Lily Bouquet the one section where Yuyu&#039;s feelings and her craziness side collides, leading to a fight toward artistry instead of just settling for commerce. The rest of this messy &quot;prelude&quot; is almost all commerce (fan service, unconcluded plot, etc) focused on the future game. As a positive part, how Yuyu&#039;s controlled her madness, the mystery surrounding her, and her relation with Riri kept me watching the story. The darkness developed in this part of the story is acceptable and at least worth the time. Meanwhile, additional information is misplaced. For example, Yuri&#039;s introduction could have been handled better, and there are several enigmas around her. <br />

Still, Assault Lily Bouquet does a moderately good job building an intriguing plot and an acceptable mystery. Some of the visuals are quite lovely: The characters&#039; design, some charms ideas, the backgrounds were the plot reaches the climax. Also, the sound is acceptable, has a score that does the job, and I cannot forget about the OP, Sacred World, which is excellent with good composition and rhythm. <br />
<br />
Finally, we like to compare this series with Granblem, Madoka, etc., and it could be a mistake. We should try to understand the plot elements and enjoy the relationship between Yuyu and Riri and how they work their problems to enjoy the story and avoid comparing with different franchises that will always lead to differences and discrepancy. Overall, Yuyu&#039;s main plot is good and will be worth your time, and why not? It will help you to decide if the future game is worth your time. <br />
<br />
Facts:<br />
Is this series popular? To date, the series is 18 on the Japanese TV ranking, and that isn&#039;t an awful position for a series that several viewers are considering a piece of garbage.  On the other hand, Tonikaku Kawaii ended in place 24. (These aren&#039;t the final season position yet, but I made my point)

    Assault Lilly was a great ride from beginning to end, and was in my opinion, one of the sleeper hits of the season.<br />
<br />
Based on the dolls of the same name, Assault Lilly brought to characters from the toy line in the setting of a magical girls school to train girls to fight monsters. Basic premise, but really fun execution in my opinion. As a fan of Mahou Shoujo and general CGDCT, I thought Assault Lilly was another good addition to the genre. While the plot is not outstanding, it was well written enough for me to grow to love the girls, empathise with them when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369791">
        they went through adversity and care about their development.<br />
<br />
I’m a simple man to please, so cute girls/waifus plus action, drama and yuri undertones are more than enough to satisfy me. If you’re looking for a really fleshed out story and world, you won’t find that in Assault Lilly. It’s very obvious that it was made to promote the toy line. That’s ok in my opinion, not everything has to be Homer or Socrates to be enjoyable. For what it is, Assault Lilly is great.<br />
<br />
My only real gripe about the series is the CGI. SHAFT do their usual job with the art, direction and everything else, but CGI was pretty subpar in this show in my opinion. I don’t think it’s a distraction, but it was definitely really noticeable in action sequences. Other than that, SHAFT did a great job as usual.<br />
<br />
With enjoyable characters, cute moments, action and enough thighs to satisfy the horniest of us, Assault Lilly was a thoroughly memorable experience and I will certainly miss it. Assault Lilly gets 10 thighs out of 10.

    I&#039;d be honest, I didn&#039;t have any expectations when I started watching this. For me it was another side series done by Shaft. The show delivered what it promised from the first few episodes (i.e. thighs). The story isn&#039;t anything mind blowing, but I didn&#039;t expect it to have it in the first place. But the way it&#039;s presented will sure make you curious, and raise some questions, and make you think. If you don&#039;t want to think much, you&#039;ll still find it enjoyable. The art and animation is great, and Shaft has made a good use of 3DCG. I love the opening song, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369939">
        characters are funny and you&#039;ll remember their personalities and faces, not necessarily their names.<br />
There are so many characters and you&#039;ll see people complain about it, but you don&#039;t have to focus on them. They are not the main focus of the story but still if you&#039;re interested about them, you&#039;ll find something about them on the internet and the upcoming game. The show has its fun movement, sad moments and you&#039;ll see the main characters developed a lot by the end of the first season. <br />
The show is Yuri, Action, Thighs, Bath Scenes. No nudity or anything inappropriate though. There&#039;s handholding if you consider that lewd. Those are the selling points of the show. If you hate such type of material, honestly you&#039;re not going to like it. But still if you watch it and then complain about a not so original and average story, it&#039;s your fault. Watch it for great visuals, Shaft, and everything else I mentioned above. The show is nowhere near the other great works by Shaft, but the world it’s set in has potential. If I have to compare it with something, I’ll compare it Symphogear series. So if you like that, you’ll probably like this more.

    So far, Assault Lily: Bouquet isn&#039;t an awful show per se, but it&#039;s sorely lacking in originality. <br />
<br />
For starters, the concept is straight out of RWBY -- teenage girls with gunblades fighting against evil monsters that threaten humanity. We have a similar high school setting to early RWBY -- hell we&#039;re introduced to our naive protagonist on her first day at the academy, and she immediately meets a rich heiress who eventually becomes a close friend. Like, it doesn&#039;t even try to hide this part -- episode 3 starts off by revealing everyone has a semblance... er sorry, &quot;Rare Skill&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, that&#039;s still a fun enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361129">
        setting to play with, so maybe the characters will make up for it?<br />
<br />
Sorry, I can&#039;t even say that with a straight face. It took the first roll of the OP for me to figure out exactly who our main character Riri Hitotsuyanagi was going to be, even before the show introduced her.<br />
<br />
See, about a decade ago Shaft made this show you might&#039;ve heard of -- Madoka Magica. It was a big success -- and ever since then everyone and their dog has been trying to ride on its coattails. In other words, the magical girl genre has been consumed with innocent, pink-haired protagonists and cold dark-haired deuteragonists. I&#039;m not even saying Madoka invented this character dynamic, but it&#039;s hard to pin this on anyone else when it&#039;s been ingrained down to the designs. Yuki Yuna is a Hero, Granbelm, Magical Girl Raising Project -- even shows outside of the genre like Revue Starlight (well, mostly just the Homura part in that case). Not to say it&#039;s been completely cookie cutter -- some of them do a solid job of putting their own spin on it -- but it&#039;s been starting to get really stale. Half the time, you can take one glance at these characters and know exactly what&#039;s coming from them.<br />
<br />
Despite it being their own progeny, Shaft&#039;s been far from immune to this -- if anything they&#039;ve shown they have no problem playing even stronger into it than everyone else. Magia Record&#039;s main pair of characters were one of the clearest examples of this trend -- but even that was forgivable considering it was a Madoka spin-off.<br />
<br />
Assault Lily&#039;s just as blatant with no excuses to be found.<br />
<br />
If this was the first time I&#039;d seen it, I wouldn&#039;t care that much, but it&#039;s been a decade y&#039;all, come up with something else. I also don&#039;t actually think this character dynamic is that great -- especially the protagonist part -- and I love Madoka Magica. It plays well off Madoka&#039;s plot (which heavily drives Madoka&#039;s entire cast) and adds strong contrast, but put into most other shows it&#039;s really not that interesting. An innocent, pure, goody-two-shoes really isn&#039;t a very interesting POV for most stories, and this one hasn&#039;t really felt any different.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is a bunch of cliches that haven&#039;t really been fleshed out at all yet. I&#039;m expecting this show to just go the Magia Record route and have a bunch of mostly disconnected stories fleshing out the like, 15 named characters who mostly have significant effort put into their designs. Four episodes in, I can’t keep track of all of them, and I can barely even tell which ones are important to the show. I&#039;m also expecting to never care about most of the cast because there won’t be enough time to develop them meaningfully -- as is, the show has speedrun through Yuyu&#039;s character arc. Episode 4 also awkwardly shuffled into a new character’s arc just to speedrun through it even harder, so this is a concerning trend.<br />
<br />
Okay, but what about the production quality? Even Magia Record had that as a pretty strong saving grace, and Shaft has produced some of the prettiest and most stylistically memorable shows of the past ~decade (eg 3-gatsu no Lion, Madoka Magica, and the Monogatari series).<br />
<br />
It&#039;s... not bad? I certainly haven&#039;t had any issues with it. The opening&#039;s solid, the character designs are nice, the animation&#039;s felt fairly fluid... but I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s not really standing out to me. I feel bad complaining about it, but given we&#039;re talking Shaft, I can&#039;t help but want something more than this bland packaging.<br />
<br />
As for anything else about the writing, I&#039;ve been struggling to put my finger on why exactly, but the tone and direction of the show feel a little all over the place. For instance, I was expecting a darker shift in tone from the backstory of Yuyu, but the show didn&#039;t really build up towards that shift at all. It&#039;s been really light and comedic -- befitting of the high school-esque setting, but really strange when the show switches to a life-threatening fight against a &#039;Huge&#039;. For specific instances, the first episode has both Riri and Kaede almost get killed, or the third episode casually points out the Huge they&#039;re fighting has killed dozens of Lillies... and yet there&#039;s not really any tension or grit to the actual fights, and these details feel quickly forgotten. In general, the world-building has felt rather slap-dash and poorly thought-out/defined so far; that being said, it&#039;s only been a few episodes, so I can&#039;t really say that much yet.<br />
<br />
I really do hope this anime is able to pick up the slack and find its own voice in future episodes, but as of now I&#039;m starting to feel a little indifferent towards it. Shaft can certainly do a lot better than this. It&#039;s /okay/ for now, but I worry it&#039;s going to get more and more tired and insubstantial as time goes on -- especially with such a large cast awkwardly looming. There’s at least a certain cutesiness to the character interactions and their ‘yuri’ namesakes, but so far the show doesn’t really feel committed to this angle (or any angle, for that matter).<br />

(At a pre-production introduction meeting in Shaft&#039;s HQ)<br />
Bushiroad: Greetings, we&#039;re here to promote our newest toy line of figurines made by Azone International, it&#039;s called: Assault Lily and Custom Lily. Combine girlish youthful heroes termed &quot;Lilies&quot;, with their powers of &quot;Rare Skill: Magie&quot; charging anti-weapons called &quot;CHARM (Counter Huge ARMs)&quot; and fighting against monstrous monsters called &quot;Huge&quot;. In addition, we also have a mobile game coming up soon and really stretched of resources, is there any way that you can help us make this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369648">
        advertisement grow?<br />
<br />
Series Director Shouji Saeki: We can help think and pen down a fictional story based on your synopsis alone. Oh, and by the way, you have come to the correct studio to discuss this project! WHY? We embrace our signature &quot;magical girls gone heavily dark&quot; scenario (popularized by Madoka Magica), the ever-so-popular THICC thigh angle shots (for some sweet-ass thirsty fanservice) and strong Yuri/death-bait undertones. And while at it, let&#039;s create a &quot;sanctuary&quot; for them (Yurigaoka &quot;Garden&quot; Academy training school) to enjoy some CGDCT elements of fun and protect one another, because it&#039;s the power of lesbian love! ALL HAIL YURI (self-insert for jokes xD)<br />
<br />
With that, Assault Lily: Bouquet is established, and that&#039;s all you&#039;re required to know watching this show. exact to the T. Just great, and who cares about the off-throwing terms of Schutzengel, Schild, Charismas and Rare Skills anyways...<br />
<br />
“Though lovers be lost, love shall not.” - Dylan Thomas<br />
<br />
If the story plot doesn&#039;t hook you, then the characters will, starting from the first-year MCs of a new-gen Lilies Legion:<br />
- Riri Hitotsuyanagi, the energetic and motivational pink-haired protagonist leader, and writhe with a &quot;saviour complex&quot; after being saved by another girl:<br />
- Yuyu Shirai, the dark-haired idolized sophomore of the Academy, and simultaneously a broken-hearted wreck of a lone wolf deuteragonist (due to her past). Easy complications molded her to take up the tutelage of Riri, establishing a contract between both of them in the form of Schutzengel and Schild (think of it like a parent-child relationship).<br />
- Kaede J. (Johan) Nouvel, a French girl whose family is the forefront manufacturer of the CHARM weapons. She&#039;s always envious of all the developing Yuri relationships and attempts to be the butt of all jokes. Of all the girls in the team, I genuinely love her &quot;intimidating&quot; character personality a lot, no joke about that!<br />
- Fumi Futagawa, the obsessed otaku of the Academy, if you have a question about Lilies, she&#039;s the go-to girl to watch out for.<br />
- Tazusa Andou, the alienating character when it comes to trust conflicts and the experimentation of her abilities as a &quot;Boosted Lily&quot;, creating the harsh and taxing people-growth.<br />
- Mai Thi Yoshimura, a Vietnamese easy-going girl with a vibrant personality. Just don&#039;t troll her with tenacious trainings.<br />
- Kuo Shenlin, a Taiwanese girl who is kind to others and looks out for people, mainly her friend:<br />
- Wang Yujia, a Chinese girl whom is an introvert and needs reliance on people on the emotional front.<br />
- Miriam Hildegard von Gropius (just call her Gropi), a German girl whose genius status is unrivalled, but the same can be said for her extreme game addiction, much less a troublemaker.<br />
- Finally, the temporary member Yuri (I won&#039;t reveal how her name came about), made from a mix of both human and Huge DNA, though showing exemplary abilities of an Artificial Lily (while she lasted).<br />
<br />
Overall, not to worry if you forget who they are, because their names pop up ALL THE TIME to get you &quot;invested&quot; into their generic quirky character dynamics that make up the Hitotsuyanagi Team. Plus the other characters (of which I&#039;ll not mention because of the sheer number of them all), it paints both a fun and grim dramatic picture of relations that both explains and answers the only question: &quot;Who and what are you fighting for?&quot; It isn&#039;t a clear-cut case of just fighting against monsters, that&#039;s the very obvious-but-cliché part, and you can fill in the blanks of close speculation to accurate depiction of how all of this&#039;ll unfold.<br />

“The bitterest tears shed over graves, are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.” - Harriet Beecher Stowe<br />
<br />
And since it&#039;s Shaft, in the 10 years (from the time of this review) ever since Madoka Magica came out, it has been the only studio to start the &quot;magical girls gone heavily dark&quot; craze structure right, and then seemingly just gave up its strong foothold altogether with the spin-off Magia Record. Since then and in-between, many others have tried to replicate the structure (see Yuuki Yuuna, Mahou Shoujo Raising Project, Granbelm among few others) to differentiating results of success. Assault Lily: Bouquet is no different, and the visual (both art and animation) style is almost symmetrical of the dark fantasy genre on both its setting and character designs, yet asymmetrical when it comes to everything else. This makes me wonder if the director&#039;s future work (of Luminous Witches) will have a direct copy-and-paste feature.<br />
<br />
“Analysis of death is not for the sake of becoming fearful, but to appreciate this precious lifetime.” - Dalai Lama<br />
<br />
The sound design and music though is really good, and sadly the only area where I can praise in a sea of &quot;obligatory&quot; originality. I already know that RAISE A SUILEN has a monstrous fanbase in Japan (because of their BanG Dream!! foundations), and barring the Cardfight!! Vanguard theme songs, this is the all-female group&#039;s 1st ever theme song to hit mainstream anime, and NGL, it&#039;s a banger song to start the show alright. The Hitotsuyanagi Legion team of VAs coming back for the ED and it&#039;s a visual showcase of death flags here and there (along with some sweet Yuri, DUH).<br />
<br />
“In life, we weep at the thought of death. In death, perhaps we weep at the thought of life.” - Marilyn Monroe<br />
<br />
As a whole, Assault Lily: Bouquet does only one thing right: add a number onto the onslaught of dark magical fantasy genre-based shows. Even if coupled with some decent action, this is still pretty tame by Madoka Magica standards, and the willingness of Shouji Saeki to even try is an admiration in itself, but I wouldn&#039;t push past against it. A mediocre-to-fine show if I can call it best, in an otherwise great effort of advertisement to potential fans that&#039;ll fap at anything Yuri-related.<br />
<br />
Ending this review on a positive note:<br />
“I joyfully await the exit – and I hope never to return.” - Frida Kahlo

    There is a lot to say about how Assault Lily is so far, is it bad? Is it good? Well let me explain.<br />
<br />
I feel somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assault Lily so far, wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s a bad anime, but it&#039;s a good one at best. Let&#039;s start off with the characters. We&#039;ve got a wide bunch of a cast, with some interesting and deep backgrounds when it comes to some, but also with how the story that has been set up, it just makes you interested in a more in depth look on the characters, and what they can offer. Which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361002">
        is good for a show. The characters have that going for them, but they&#039;re a bundle of personalities that really mesh well with one another. Along with the obvious Yuri vibes for even more extra fun. It&#039;s very cute and charming.<br />
<br />
As for the story itself, it&#039;s a fun plot so far, with how it&#039;s set up. So far considering where it&#039;s at, there isn&#039;t much to tell besides what it&#039;s set up at the start not that is a bad thing, but the school setting, and seeing what lillies are all about is still a good starting point, But I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll go more deep as it goes along, and I cannot wait to see what in fact does happen.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are fitting for the moods, and also in terms of the art, are colourful, and nice and good to look at, cannot go wrong there.<br />
<br />
Would I say watch it? For sure, it&#039;s setting up stuff for now, which just gathers more interest, and you&#039;ll be keen to know what it&#039;s setting up is.

    To summarize: this anime isn&#039;t very good. I particularly find fault in the protagonist Riri&#039;s naivety, to the point it&#039;s annoying. In cliche bishojo naivety, Riri follows her Onee-sama foil Yuyu in the path of a Lily, another bishojo-with-weapons warrior fighting against unknown enemies, like Madoka Magica, Brave Witches, or Toji no Miko. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, unlike its superior brethren above, Assault Lily does not do anything to differentiate itself from the pack. It spends the first four episodes hanging worn tropes like teasing a &quot;secretly&quot; overpowered-protagonist, showing fanservice bathtowel scenes, and not fleshing out its protagonist outside of her interactions with her idol Yuyu. Riri is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367182">
        obsessed with Yuyu to the point her interactions with other characters feel more like stepping stones to get closer to Yuyu rather than actual supporting characters to help her bring out more personality.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s not to say Riri is apathetic, she cares about Yuyu&#039;s wellbeing, but she&#039;s just so narrowmindedly naive to the core, she essentially denies herself of any characterization, to the point she&#039;s just a walking trope of a naive female protagonist (e.g. Yoshika of Strike Witches season 1).<br />
her pursuit of her heroine foil.<br />
But other than her unnatural Yuyu obsession (which other characters also point out once, but is overshadowed), Riri has no redeeming traits to her naiviety that borders on ego (that is pointed out once in the anime and then ignored after), and like most other naive protagonists, she finds a way to justify her want to help Yuyu even if it means prying into old wounds.<br />
<br />
Riri&#039;s initial relationship with the quiet, cynical and brooding Yuyu has her naivety challenged by Yuyu herself, who wants to &quot;teach&quot; the naive Riri about how cruel the world really is, but by episode 4, this foreshadowing loses its chance to appear as  Riri is quickly established as the calming Beauty to Yuyu&#039;s inner revenge-filled Beast, but the buildup to that moment is neither emotionally investing for the viewer, nor is it memorable. <br />
This anime would be a great modern day military retelling  of the whole Yuri genre&#039;s Onee-sama trope if it wasn&#039;t for the lack of depth in anyone except Yuyu herself, whose personality has turned from kind to cool girl from past trauma,in a Akemi Homura style of events.<br />
<br />
A weekly TV show needs to be interesting in its first half to have people care about it as much as its director(s) does, but if the director doesn&#039;t flesh out the characters properly, no one will care what happens to them next week. To be fair,  dramatic twists are typically executed in the latter half of an anime, but in order to keep an audience interested in watching a TV show on a weekly basis, even a anime like Assault Lily must have something that an audience can get invested in at the beginning. Like yuri-baiting or the cleavage fanservice for example, which the first half of this show has plenty of, though it isn&#039;t anything more than casual fanservice.<br />
Sound and Art are rated high because the chara design is beautiful, and the opening song memorable (it&#039;s played by Raise a Suilen of Bang Dream). The rest of the soundtrack however is forgettable. <br />
<br />
Overall, I disliked the protagonist&#039;s naiviety bordering on ego, and the lack of any characterization for anyone except her foil Yuyu. Assault Lily has the potential to be a bishojo-with-weapons interpretation of the classic onee-sama Yuri school genre (Maria sama ga Miteru, Strawberry Panic), but its lack of characterization and story hooks in the early half of the episodes wastes said story opportunities in favor of fanservice, fight scenes, and too many characters to remember or care about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even hardcore fans of the genre might be hard-pressed to find a reason to watch Assault Lily for its characterization OR plot, as there is very little of it in the first four episodes.  Overall, Assault Lily has potential to shine on paper, but in execution it&#039;s inferior to its fellow bishojo anime.<br />
<br />

    Assault Lily Bouquet takes place in a all girls school/ training facility for Lilies.<br />
A Lily&#039;s duty is to fight mages, the monsters that are roaming the world and that pose a huge treath to humanity.  <br />
<br />
The two main characters Yuyu and Riri are very different but still have a strong bond to one another. <br />
<br />
Yuyu is a cold, frightening and misterious girl with a sad backstory that does not have many friends. <br />
<br />
while Riri is a fun, cheerful and openhearted girl. <br />
<br />
As for the other characters there&#039;s not much to say, they all have pretty much the same personality and I can&#039;t remember a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361127">
        single name. <br />
<br />
The anime has a shoujo-ai feeling to it and I hope that it actually goes in that direction.  As for the story the only thing that I am really intersted in is Yuyu&#039;s backstory as nothing else really got me invested, the monsters look like a mixture of the franxx and that pokemon magnemite and they aren&#039;t very &quot;cool&quot;. None of the characters other than Yuyu really have any depth to them. <br />
<br />
The music is great and the OP is a Bop! <br />
The animation is also really good. <br />
<br />
And it has very funny moments. My personal favorite line (this far) is “if I were a masochist I’d be over the moon”<br />
<br />
I recommend Assault Lily Bouqet, it is cute, fun and simple with a tinyyyyyyy bit of depth to ONE (1) character and it has that &quot;monsters have taken over the world and only teenagers can fight them and those teens only purpose is to fight these monsters and nothing else&quot; feeling that Darling in the franxx and Evangelion has. <br />
<br />
7/10

    Someone should teach people not to judge anime by first 4 episodes. This anime starts slow and bland, but after a few episodes it becomes one of the best things I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
The plot is your clasiccal &quot;teenage girls fightnign monsters&quot;, but man oh man do they do it in a spectacular way. The story keeps nice balance between fights and relations, and is unexpectidally deep. You might think that the only negative thing in the story is the background of one of the girls, but then...(#nospoiler, go see it lol)<br />
<br />
The art is well-refined and polished, and basically CGI-free. Every edge feels nice and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367504">
        the anime itself can capture the mood with shapes and colours of the scenes. The design of the weapons and monsets - Huge - isn&#039;t edgy and is very nice. The Huge might look like robots but then the weapons make even more sense.<br />
<br />
The sound is perfect. The opening - Sacred worldy by Raise A Sullen - is a banger, and can compete with Tonikawa for the best op of the season. The ending is low-key but really enjoyable aswell. The music is very well-done and it blends in with the scenes perfectly, or it can also make you predict on what is going to happen next.<br />
<br />
Someone described the characters as &quot;bland&quot;, but after watching 10 episodes basically every character that the anime uses is well defined and has her own charm (literally). I can safely say at least something about a girl when I see her. Many of the girls have their own quirks, but that makes them even more lovable and recognisable.<br />
<br />
Overall, a great 10/10 that I would reccomand to anyone. It has the perfect ratio of fights, cuteness, sadness and depth. For me, the best anime of the season.

    How far can the distance be between textual quality and anime production? For many, both production and history need to go together, as one complements the other in order to boast of their effort, bringing pride to the show&#039;s creators. Even more so when an anime involves action and a combination of scenes that need to coexist with direction, sound and animation. Assault Lily Bouquet ended and it was a very different experience to follow. Not because it is an excellent anime, but it exemplifies and practically answers the question I mentioned above. Who would have thought that such a good proposal would be overlooked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372086">
        just to make the environment friendly, where the characters&#039; daily lives are just a slice of life... No, it&#039;s more than that. The anime is not entirely wasted, it has unusual qualities and works as a pastime, but what makes it so &quot;average&quot;? What was it really like to watch 12 episodes of functional and impactless fights, while countless characters were shown that, now, everyone who has completed this show must have forgotten the majority? That&#039;s what I&#039;m still trying to find out.<br />
<br />
In order to evaluate this show, it is necessary to differentiate what he had as his goal and what he achieved. Assault Lily is a story where girls with some rare abilities are students at an institution, which at the same time serves as a school and meeting place to annihilate Huges, a type of creature that is controlled by an overwhelming power, Magie, whose sole purpose to attack everything around you. The Lilys, the students, also use Magie in their weapons, known as CHARM, where they fight intense battles with each new invasion on the site. As an idea, the anime made a very good and creative situation that, although not innovative, has a good and interesting system, which entertained me and convinced me to finish the series. The show has charismatic characters and manages to moderate things like comedy, drama and action, even with a text that does not attract public attention. I believe that this happened because the show did not expose a positive relationship between the episodes, as some were totally focused on combat and others did not even have a training or purpose to exist. Something like this happened with Cop Craft, a 2019 anime. In it, the serious and captivating episodes were hampered by a large amount of dialogue that does not please, nor bear fruit for the continuity of the series. Assault Lily had the same fate, for she used moe as a persuasive method to convince herself that she was better than she looked. It is a technique that usually works, but this time it showed the poverty of quality of the series.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if we only pay attention to the most important episodes, where only fights matter, it is noticeable that the show is much better than its own totality. The Shaft studio did an excellent job of producing a well-appreciated number of well-directed scenes and managed to give some quality nuances to the audience. This is also due to the characters, because even though it is boring, the show manages to make us care about the protagonists, mainly Riri, Yuyu and Yuri, eventually. Whenever I saw a scene of them being sad or discouraged, I felt a mutual sadness, that is, the anime has a minimal impact load. It is not totally cold or indifferent, nor is it generic in relation to the others. It is possible to have a good enjoyment watching the show, no matter how minor the episodes of development of secondary characters are.<br />
<br />
And speaking of the girls, they deserve special attention. I confess that I was lost to accompany 9 characters and another 20 (possibly more than that) doing their thing during the show. Above all, the anime set the scene more than it conveyed any emotion. It&#039;s nice to see the CHARMs being produced, but even more so to accompany some of the characters having some importance in the show, like Kaede and Fumi, they are all adorable. But as the show did not qualify well enough, only the main pair is relevant, which turned out to be a problem, as it was unthinkable to see them defeating huge Huges, simply by power. The anime exposed things like experience and aptitude just to discard them in the most &quot;dangerous&quot; moments of the show. Riri grew in posture and changed his habits and this is remarkable is good for the series, but I imagined it would be something gradual and organic, which did not happen. Furthermore, the world politics of this show was contradictory and meaningless, especially when the government ordered it to find Yuri. A civil and internal conflict between the Lilys was expected, but everything was forgotten in the blink of an eye, as if the research, which one of the characters did, was enough to calm a possible war situation.<br />
<br />
But apart from these conveniences, the show has its apexes, which are the moments when Yuyu lives with an old and irreparable loss, to the point of dueling with herself, being something literally destructive, due to her ability. Her path, which was intended to be gloomy, gradually changed, from her meeting with Riri, to the formation of the Lilys team that her apprentice struggled to achieve. When she breaks free from it, it is delightful to see how one person has changed the life of another. Riri is responsible for this feat. Of course, her skill discovered at the end evidences her entire story in the anime. Her &quot;charisma&quot; was important to unite her colleagues, who did not get along well in the beginning, as well as being a strong weapon to save humanity from a terrible threat. The Huges seemed to be a small bomb compared to the potential that the protagonist has (even if that power is for the appealing and exaggerated). It is even possible to say that the show was saved by a pink-haired protagonist, who had nothing but a few friends and was clumsy. Nana (from the anime Munou na Nana) should learn how to be a really nice character to follow.<br />
<br />
I also highlight the music and animation. They are fluid and made perfectly for this show. The endings are striking and the fights are very expressive. It is worthy of recognition this year, especially with an increasing amount of mediocre adaptations and made with a very low quality. Definitely, this show will be most remembered for these highlights in the designs and the competent OSTs.<br />
<br />
In the end, Assault Lily Bouquet was an extravagant and new experience for me. His proposal is infinitely better than the show itself, of course, but it still gave me good memories about the reasons that make me attend Japanese shows: creativity and exclusivity. The anime ends with a feeling of &quot;I want to follow more!&quot;, But unfortunately the show may not have a sequel, as it came from a franchise not much consumed in the West, which is not productive on streaming platforms. And we know how unpopular animes like this need that attention from abroad... But even with the problems of its existence, anime has satisfied me a lot. Although the discrepancy mentioned at the beginning of this review introduces the show, it was sustained in most cases, which is not bad, just a good job from the responsible staff. Congratulations to the Shaft studio, for creating a show with such affection and for making a project different from the others. I will remember this work forever and look forward to new proposals in the future.<br />

    I got bored of the show really quickly the plot was actually something that could be interesting but as of so far they haven&#039;t done anything with it and the characters were badly written all of them are one dimensional especially the main character shes just so boring and annoying. the art and music were good but not good enough for me to stick with the series. I think its an okay yuri anime overall and they had really cute scenes most of my problems come from the fighting scenes and characters. Anyway to summarise <br />
<br />
Pros<br />
Cute scenes <br />
Yuri<br />
Amazing op<br />
Cool character designs   <br />
<br />
Cons <br />
Boring

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367959">
        plot<br />
Characters are one dimensional <br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s okay<br />

    I tried to give this a show a chance, I forced myself through as much of it as possible until I couldn&#039;t anymore.<br />
<br />
When it shows action it is well done and competent but most everything else is bland and boring.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters are barely tropes with barely enough screentime to even develop that far. The two main characters get a little bit of development but everyone else is relegated to tropes or basically being a background character in the main cast.<br />
<br />
I know people love their cute girl shows with hints of (or doused in) Yuri but this doesn&#039;t feel like it should even satisfy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366202">
        that. The characters aren&#039;t worth investing your interest in if you can even find some interest. There is basically no development to speak of.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not like it&#039;s even a slice of life, where you are seeing their day to day lives and wacky antics. Large swaths of the show is just them sitting around doing nothing but talking as if they are going through the motions of a slice of life but without any heart.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say just ignore this show, it&#039;s not worth cost of the production and it&#039;s only saving grace is it put food on the studios table.<br />
<br />
If by some miracle there is some major change that shifts this show into being good, then it&#039;s first 7 episodes would still be regarded as an awful slog.

    I was really looking forward to watching Assault Lily back when I first heard about it last year because the character designs looked great and I thought the concept had potential, even if it wasn&#039;t the most original idea in the world. However, I was also slightly concerned it would end up being a glorified toy commercial to sell merch, among other things, and unfortunately it turned into pretty much all the things I was worried it would become.<br />
<br />
First I&#039;ll start with the things I enjoyed about it, and then I&#039;ll move onto the more negative aspects that I had problems with. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368445">
        The animation is easily the best part about Assault Lily, the animation, character designs, and fight scenes are beautiful, and since the art was what attracted me to this show in the first place, they did pull that off quite well and I have no complaints there. The music is also very good, I loved the OP and EDs, and most of the BGMs are enjoyable, though it&#039;s not Yuki Kajura or Hiroyuki Sawano levels of quality. <br />
<br />
Worldbuilding/Lore: The worldbuilding and lore in Assault Lily was mostly what kept me going, there are a lot of fascinating aspects to it with the connections between Lilies and Huge for instance, and I really wanted to learn more about it, but unfortunately much of the worldbuilding potential was squandered in favor of cutesy moe yuribaiting, which I&#039;ll get to in a moment. <br />
<br />
Characters: This is where a lot of my issues arise with this show. It has a bloated cast of one-note characters who get little to no development and end up being one-dimensional magical girl tropes. It&#039;s hard to keep track of and even remember all the characters, which is probably why their names show up on screen every time they appear. The only characters that get any development are Riri and Yuyu, and while I like their relationship, even after 11 episodes I still feel like they haven&#039;t developed their bond very much, they don&#039;t share much of their intimate feelings or desires, and they rarely open up to one another. The only semblance of bonding between these two is when Yuyu goes into PMS berserk mode and Riri has to calm her down, but even this feels forced and contrived.<br />
<br />
Story: The plot is nonexistent, if you asked me what this story was about, I honestly couldn&#039;t tell you. It feels like it doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be, and the writers were just putting down whatever popped into their heads, which is mostly boring slice of life stuff that drags on forever. Whenever any interesting tidbits of lore come up, they&#039;re just vaguely mentioned and then they move right on without really expanding on it at all, which is disappointing because the worldbuilding has so much potential. The pacing is incredibly slow and directionless, like the creators had no idea what story they even wanted to tell, until the last 4 episodes when they pretty much went &quot;well I guess we gotta come up with some kind of ending.&quot; It puts so much focus on the yuribaiting and slice of life aspects for 80% of the show, then occasionally decides to toss out a few crumbs of &quot;story&quot; that take forever to get anywhere. It doesn&#039;t have to go full on grimdark like Madoka Magica, but I think the balance between the more lighthearted and serious moments could have been handled much better. <br />
<br />
Fanservice: This aspect is the worst part for me, and it really soured a lot of my enjoyment of the show. Now I love yuri, but what I can&#039;t stand is yuribait, and this is exactly the latter. We&#039;ve got all these girls flirting and being cute with each other, but it never goes anywhere because all the characters are bland tropes with no development, and most of the times it comes off as super cheesy and dumb more than anything. Like, they literally put &quot;yuri&quot; in the name of the academy, the names of our two main characters (Yuyu and Riri), and even an entire character named Yuri who is portrayed as a &quot;daughter&quot; of sorts to Riri and Yuyu. It&#039;s eye-rolling levels of yuribaiting and it&#039;s severely offputting to me. I actually do ship Riri and Yuyu because I like their dynamic, but the show does barely anything to develop their relationship and to get them to know each other better. Aside from that we&#039;ve got tons of bath scenes as well as thighs, and it&#039;s just...whatever, I guess. It&#039;s not ecchi levels, but I have a big aversion to fanservice and it&#039;s honestly disappointing to me that this seems to be the only thing people care about in this show, rather than the story or characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Thoughts: I&#039;ve seen a lot of anime over the years (180 to be exact) and I&#039;ve seen my share of amazing shows, very good shows, decent shows, and plain bad shows. Assault Lily falls into the category of decent shows for me. It&#039;s not the worst thing I&#039;ve ever seen, but it&#039;s far from the best. The animation, character designs, fight scenes, music, and worldbuilding/lore are all great and have potential, but it suffers from a directionless plot, an overstuffed cast of bland characters, and pointless, annoying yuribaiting and fanservice. If they come out with a second season for Assault Lily I probably won&#039;t watch it, because even with its few good points, that&#039;s not enough to outweigh its massive narrative problems for me, and once the final episode airs next week and I finish up this show I&#039;ll be moving on to other things.

    First Review so ignore if it may sound weird but,<br />
If you are here to watch thicc waifus doing one on one yuri action, then this is the show for you.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Don&#039;t expect too much from the story since it the old world conquered by some random alien and trying to kill everyone in its path and special troops called lily are there to defend. Did you feel anything, I am sure you did not.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Nice thicc characters and all-female so enjoy the girl on girl action.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Character design good, the story has tried to put a soul in it, but till the 3rd episode, not much of the

    I&#039;m really conflicted over my scoring. I really want to give it 10 for the delicacy of thighs throughout this entire anime. Like not only is there a lot of thighs, but they&#039;re all so great.<br />
<br />
I feel overall as an anime, it&#039;s worth a 7, pretty average across the board, so I gave it a 7 to fit in with that. but I really would give it a 10 based on the thighs alone.<br />
<br />
thighs, I swear that&#039;s the main plot, nothing had my attention more than the beauty of the thighs in this anime, which is a variety of thigh highs and leggings, and just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407695">
        thigh in some occasional scenes.<br />
<br />
I get that all I&#039;ve really mentioned was thighs this and thighs that, but that is literally the only reason why I wanted to write this review

    The definitive underdog of the season. The 6.46 score is undeserved. I don´t understand why is this rated so low.<br />
<br />
The story was nice. They constructed a great world with lots of possibilities and ways to carry the story. Animation was great (especially on Yuri fighting the robot) and sound was amazing (banger OP, great four endings, nice insert songs). Characters were also nice and beautiful, with none of them being hateable. Incredible how they got to attack by literally passing a bullet with Guardiola´s or Cappa´s style. Amazing football reference there. I really enjoyed this anime, and still wonder why score is so low.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Art:

Should you watch it? Yeah, give it a try.

    Assault Lily: Bouquet (2020)<br />
<br />
Who knew an outfit could have such an amazing safety feature. <br />
<br />
This series is somewhat Yuri however it is mostly just on the basis of isolation as such. As you would expect another world where men, boys and adults of all identities, in general, are basically powerless so the fate of survival is left to young girls in cute outfits with swords that can also be a gun. Essentially, that is what the show is, and by no means am I suggesting that is a bad thing since as far as the show goes it is a good ride. <br />
<br />
The art style

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369870">
        used is nice, it is what I would say is a high-grade medium in the regard it is very refined but is starting to be an older format in the regard of not being so polished as to what is available. It is a single-season so doesn&#039;t have a history to back up the choice. That said it means it is pretty standard but that is good still. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED are both pretty fun and nice to hear. SFX is pretty good but not so deep in combat but generally is a bit above standard, therefore. <br />
<br />
Characters are all pretty similar with some personality trait differences just to stop carbon copying. Thankfully they all look different which is nice to see. As far as development goes we have the average dog experience rather than the underdog. Riri who is the main character is instantly liked by basically everyone and meets the requirements to be there by the minimum standard of entry but of course, she has unknown to everyone something special a rare skill. Everyone has one and some more useful than others. Hers, well... there is a reason she is the main character. <br />
<br />
Best girls for me:<br />
<br />
1. Miliam Hildegard von Guropius. Why? She is adorable, her voice is adorable and she is powerful. The dream of her may have been crushed in the final episode though. <br />
2. Thi Mai Yoshimura. Why? She has an eccentric personality, has independence but yet grows. <br />
3. Tazusa Andou. Why? She loves cats and is similar to Thi. <br />
<br />
The show as a whole is pretty standard in the entire spectrum. With somewhat above average sound it also has the inclusion of what you do not always see in a fight. In the closing episode, we have a fight as you would expect but instead of everyone being useless watching our MC battle it out they include people. It isn&#039;t quite everyone recklessly attacking together but more supporting directly. That is great, not perfect but great. A better show than many in that regard. <br />
<br />
To finish just before it goes into a final cute sequence it shows off a huge moment in that you will see that basically screams out read the source material. Not sure if I will, to be honest, it was nice to watch but not so sure if that makes it nice to read.<br />
<br />
7/10.

    overall score: -low six- (6.2)<br />
<br />
First things first The chara design here is really......how should i say it &quot;eye catching&quot;<br />
<br />
The story is so-so but the fight scene does show some great animation and quality in it. here you basically have all of your generic essential character like the energetic one, the lazy one, the cute one so-on, so-on. even tho the chara and the plot is nothing special the thing that caught me is the way they serve the show.<br />
<br />
The way they show from scene to scene and from other perspective to another perspective is just somewhat indifferent for me to see. They didn&#039;t only focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369862">
        on the MC but also focuses on the other character despite having so many of them.<br />
<br />
ps. yuyu and riri has the best thighs no debate.

Assault Lily: Bouquet. What a way to treat myself for christmas and end the year with.<br />
<br />
I myself, is no expert by all means when writing reviews hence I would like to say that my writing may sway from its main purpose before we get into the review. Moreover, I apologise if you, the reader, finds unsuitable things within this review, should it be spelling and grammar or mistakes and inaccuracy.<br />
<br />
Assault Lily: Bouquet, the original anime that was made by Shaft that is famously known for their complex stories and their stunning visuals, such as the monogatari series. But this is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369743">
        nothing about what Shaft did in the past, this is about Assault Lily.<br />
<br />
We are introduced with Riri, a young girl moving to a military academy and as the defence against Huges, threats of humans. Riri is a very charming girl that everyone loves including me. She quickly made friends with first grades and shared a reasonably deep bond. However, since Riri just started her school, she is the ‘rookie’ character in the first bit. As Riri makes more friends, she encounters Yuyu.<br />
Yuyu, known as the lone wolf in the school which is avoided by many other students. Riri, on the other hand, somehow managed to spark a relationship which will deepen in the near future.<br />
<br />
Riri faces inconveniences with her ability to properly wield CHARMS. With the help of her friends , she eventually managed to wield CHARM. Some may see at this point that this anime will be a ‘Cute girls doing crazy things’ or whatever it’s called but basically it&#039;s a bunch of cute anime girls doing super cool and crazy things, which it is BUT not completely. <br />
<br />
What I enjoyed most from this anime is the characters and their interactions. As new episodes come out, without a doubt that it will contain heart warming wholesomeness interactions. Each and every side character feels like they are someone very important to the story and someone that can be loved. In this case, I really, really liked them all. <br />
<br />
Every character has their own quirks and abilities, which then helped Riri during her hard times. Their personality also resembles their appearance and is uniquely written by the designers. The uniqueness of each character means that they also have different reasons to fight for which then adds more personality to them.<br />
Each bond between Riri and the side characters means something special for me personally. It feels as if they made a deep bond with the audience itself. At dark times, plenty actually, it made me squirm and feel the pain that Riri is experiencing. To see the way when things are dark, you only need a light. The relation that Riri has developed clearly became the light for her path.<br />
<br />
As for the visuals, it is one of the best. Shaft did it again with this anime with some superb colors, character design, props, etc. This was one of the things that I enjoyed the most from the anime. I truly cannot say anything much since the animation visuals are just straight out stunning that I would even use them for wallpapers. The colors are vibrant and pleasing to the eyes, lines are noticeable but in a good way, background designs are also amazing, and the action scenes were better than average. However, there is some noticeable CGI that is not too pleasing but this only appeared for a few times.<br />
<br />
For the audio, it’s great. OP and ED are great, no complaints. As for the acting, there may be some improvements, but overall it’s enjoyable and understandable. Moving on with the sound effects, it’s not the best but considerably nice.<br />
<br />
The directing in this anime is great. The scenes are drawn properly and very pleasing to the eye. The choice of the color pallets really outlined the moving parts and the characters. Not to forget, the fan service of this anime. It is good. Not too much, not too little. Thicc thighs everywhere, but yet it’s imperceptible unless you really look for it. <br />
<br />
Since I’ve been discussing the good parts, now are the flaws of the anime.<br />
<br />
It’s cringey. During the ‘tense’ parts of the story or episode, it’s just cringey when the characters interact with each other. Somehow, the way they interact between those parts is just straight unsuitable and a potential mood killer.<br />
<br />
The pacing overall is unusual. Not that I’m complaining or anything but the first 4-6 episodes were moving slowly as they introduced more characters to the story and more plot explanation. However, some episodes just went super quick. It’s as if a problem starts to resolve too quickly which disappointed me.<br />
<br />
The people behind this anime seem to like shoving in new faces and forcing the audience to remember them. Personally, I think there are too many side characters that’s being introduced which then left out without proper explanation or background. Same with the main plot of the story, there is just not enough explanation. Sure, I understand about the CHARM and HUGES, but I feel like there need to be more explicit explanations which may help the audience to actually understand to the core.<br />
<br />
I personally really enjoyed this anime to the point that I’m willing to stand up for it. I can see why some people dislike a ‘female character only,’ but in this case, Assault Lily did a great job to deliver the energy of excitement to me.<br />
<br />
At first, I was actually sceptical about this anime. Clearly the yuri vibes are there and made me unsure about this. Fortunately, I came to enjoy this anime because of the relationship between Riri and the other girls. It feels as if I can understand Riri’s relationship and bond with her friends. As for the yuri vibes, it’s great yeah! I like the subtle hints and the illustrations at ED.<br />
<br />
Before this gets too long and me rambling more without a real goal, I’ll conclude my review.<br />
Assault Lily: Bouquet, what a great way to end the season, yet it’s still not delivering it’s full potential. At this point, I really appreciate the people behind this since it made me hooked on, but the downsides clearly aren&#039;t able to admire and complete the outstanding qualities.<br />
