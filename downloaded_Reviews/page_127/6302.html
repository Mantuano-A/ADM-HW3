In 2016, a meltdown of a nuclear power plant creates a big catastrophe in Tokyo. 20 years later, the city has become a ghost town due to the high levels of radiation. From that area a distress signal is received. The Self Defense forces dispatch three girls from the special unit Coppelion to search for survivors.

    Coppelion is what I would describe as a beautiful anime gone straight to hell. I’m not referring to the artwork here because that’s glamorous. What originally started out as an alluring premise with promise turned into an abomination that becomes almost intolerable to watch thanks to its style and overall portrayal of the post-apocalyptic genre. This anime itself is an apocalyptic failure that illustrates just how not to adapt its manga. Not that the manga is any better but Coppelion comes to me as a show that should of never been resurrected.<br />
<br />
The series itself is based off of the manga of the same name written

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125573">
        by Tomonori Inoue. The term “Coppelion” refers to an unit of trained specialists with special abilities that tries to find survivors after a faithful event that happened in the year of 2016. Apparently, the city of Tokyo becomes a contamination like war zone as its people are faced to deal with a grim reality; that reality being the brisk on extinction as the a nearby nuclear plant undergoes meltdown. So now, it’s up to the Coppelion special task force to find survivors 20 years later. This definitely sets up a decent science fiction theme series with its beautiful visuals that truly illustrates the aftermath of the tragedy as well as its story. However, that story turned out to be a tragic breakdown. <br />
<br />
The series has three main characters named Ibara Naruse, Aoi Fukasaku, and Taeko Nomura. These three girls seems to be humanity’s last hope. But what makes its setup odd is how these young girls are able to give hope to the people. That answer is simple: they all have immunity to the radiation that contaminated Tokyo. In fact, the girls are genetically engineered to be capable of surviving in such a harsh environment. But taking the word ‘capable’ to describe these girls is an overstatement here. While the trio is able to deal most of their assigned tasks, the majority of the responsibility falls into the hands of Ibara Naruse. She is portrayed as a natural leader with her confidence and her determination to help the people. Of course, she also possesses strength, agility, and intellect to carry out her tasks. Now the other question is: what about Aoi and Taeko? They also have a purpose right? In most cases, I would regrettably say no. Throughout the series, Aoi and Taeko plays the role of more like sidekicks. Taeko at one point even puts the team into jeopardy for her careless actions. What’s even worse though is Aoi, a character that is about as useful as a palm tree in the desert. She has literally no skills and often stands in the way. Her obnoxious and childish behavior also hinders the team as well as putting others during an assigned task at risk. During many instances, she seems to be scared for her own life despite trying to save others; how ironic. It seems like other needs to save her and turns out she’s probably even more human than the survivors.<br />
<br />
The story itself originally sets itself well. There’s the apocalyptic background clearly illustrated by its landscape of desolation. It composes itself both inside and outside with the ruined cities and lack of civilization. The only people our main characters seemingly encounter are survivors in the beginning. These survivors obviously do not possess the same ability as Coppelion. Instead, they depend on them in order to make it out of Tokyo alive, or die trying. As for the story itself though, this show tries hard but doesn’t land anywhere. The first episode establishes the fact that there are survivors out there but at the same time, there is also danger. Even when they do find survivors, it&#039;s usually shown that they are at the edge of their lives. This is presented in many circumstances as this show tries to draw out an image to viewers’ minds - a world in which anyone can die. At many cases, the girls are able to save the survivors but this usually falls under Ibara’s shoulders.  AGAIN, what a shocker. Almost every episode involves Ibara pulling out superhuman movements while drawing her handy pistol. Meanwhile, our other two girls sits on standby or providing little support. When Ibara succeeds, the girls plays the role of the cheerleaders. As for the survivors themselves, most of them seemingly only play a very minor role that falls under a weekly basis, to almost never seen or heard again. Some of these survivors also doesn’t seem to want to live for certain reasons as well. Later on though, the series does shift more into a progressing plot gear mode as the girls learns more about the world they are in as well as its past. Additionally, more dangerous antagonists are introduced who even has a past with the Coppelions or main characters themselves. There is also one other main supporting character named Haruto that gets introduced mid way into the series but his characterization is no better than the rest; as if they had any at all in the first place.<br />
<br />
There are also some absurd standards that makes this show question viewers what they may be watching. The girls is one example as we see they don’t stand out as anything special. They are designed like high school girls that shows hardly any menacing features. Their designs matches those of a high school student with they way they are dressed. More awkward is the fact that they are dressed in little protective gear. Instead, they wear skirts so noticeably short that surprisingly can hide what’s underneath the whole time. The series’ mechanics also has holes that doesn’t seem to add up such as the way certain military vehicles are operated or genetic engineering revolving several Coppelions. Then, there’s some of the antagonists the girls faces throughout the series. The Coppelion special force are just composed of a three unit team but most of the time are capable of taking down a military group. Even when they do get a little support from others, their task is achieved through some form of Deus Ex machina. What makes it worse though is the fact that the survivors seemingly doesn’t want how the results of a mission turns out to be. In most cases, this means their lives are saved despite a desire to pass on to the next world. The show also makes the antagonists seem weak as in almost fictional story of face and heels. In the end, the heroes usually triumphs out of some sort of odd circumstance. <br />
<br />
The artwork of this series can be described as ‘scenery porn’. Most of the landscape and backgrounds are majestically illustrated giving it a cutting edge magnificence. The desolate lands of  Tokyo truly does look like something of an aftermath from an apocalyptic event. The lack of civilization as well the destruction of its structures are further evidence of this. The production studio Gohands (known more recently for its works including K and Mardock Scramble) can draw some similarity with its background designs. Furthermore, the lack of fan service eliminates distractions that sets upon a more serious mood for this series. It also incorporates the usage of effective camera angles combined with gusts of wind to illustrate that empty settling atmosphere of the apocalyptic Tokyo as in 2036. Unfortunately, there is some odd artwork involving how the characters appear on screen on various occasions through a technique of thick line style and palate. The purpose of this seems to be unknown but from my guess is probably to focus on the characters as its prominent feature rather than its breathtaking backgrounds.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack wise, Coppelion is decent enough to live up to its expectations. Action scenes and cliffhangers are demonstrated with heart beating tones. There’s minimal comedy or fan service so most of the time, the show itself omits the usage of comedic OST but replaces them with a more solemn theme. The OP song “Angel” by angela (K, Valvrave the Liberator, Heroic Age) is catchy for its scientific-like tone of presentation. The ED song sung by her also gives off both a scientific mood with its tragedy-like style. Ibara’s VA (Haruka Tomatsu) gives off a confidence tone of voice while Aoi is a clear example of a girl in distress. Aoi represents the weakness of the team as well as the most human so her voice is often portrayed as helpless girl seeking for help despite wanting to help others.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Coppelion is a show that I tried to desperately take a liking to but its construction of the story just doesn’t swing in the right way. The premise sets up itself well and is convincing enough especially for those into science fiction or fans of post tragic series. Past series like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Shinsekai Yori, and Casshern Sins also demonstrated similar themes but had more character driven plots. However, Coppelion lacks most of that and instead puts its faith into saving survivors. The artwork did save the show quite a bit though but the story and overall execution is just tragic. I don’t mean tragic in a tear-jerking way but rather as an deterioration of a potential success. This show did not achieve success for me in any way. Instead, it was a bloody revolution. <br />

    Coppelion is an anime about these radiation immune Charlie&#039;s Angels who cry all the time and whatnot. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a melodramatic sci-fi story about these girls who won&#039;t die on radiation unlike all the other people in the world. These people are of course saints, and we get to see missions where our three radiation immune saints save people from radiation while crying. By three radiation immune saints saving people, I mean our main girl, Ibarawhatever, saving people while the other two watch. Alternatively watch and cry. <br />
<br />
The character are pretty useless and stupid and for some reason there is three of them instead of one.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review119319">
        There was a seemingly interesting settings; normal people getting saved by radiation immune people. The catch being that normal people don&#039;t think these immune people as people at all. People see them as dolls, basically. However, their actions on saving normal people would change normal people&#039;s views about radiation immune people == change for character development. Unfortunately situations like these get turned back to zero by our main girl who simply replies &quot; I don&#039;t understand such complicated things.&quot; Then we move to an another scene about crying. Followed by the next mission. Leaving me wonder why the fuck. It&#039;s not deep, there is no message. She just literally says that I&#039;m too fucking stupid to follow what you are saying about me being like human and I also have to cry since I haven&#039;t for a while. <br />
<br />
This really could have been an interesting series if there was other things going on, the characters had some sort of brain function and there was a reason for all of this. A plot, some motives, a tiny bit of depth of some sort, but instead of this the creators decided to take a way which should be referred as &quot;I have a emotion thingy.&quot; This is seriously more like some project which is still on the beta stage, only way to make it sell is to add 5 radiation immune and 5 normal bishies to the series and call it a reverse harem.

    Naturally, the post-apocalyptic genre has been quite popular as of late due to new mediums pulling their spin on it. So very few manage to do the genre justice with how vast in scope the genre generally has to go for it and most writers don’t have the most competence to write out a competent narrative. Whether or not they are about a nuclear holocaust, zombie invasion, ecological disaster, divine judgment, or pandemic reasons there are so many possibilities for story writers to come up with brilliant ideas for the genre with some great results and ones that are not so great.  Our little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125903">
        show Coppelion is one such show that falls into this category that not only fails to provide a meaningful narrative but also a dull melodramatic story that severely cripples it from being an intricate show during Japan’s nuclear fallout disaster into one that completely mocks it.<br />
<br />
One thing that almost everyone seems to be in unanimous agreement on is that the artwork is pretty spectacular to see. To which it is, backgrounds really do look amazing and fit pretty well to the tone of the post-apocalyptic setting with the dense watercolor backdrop on the dead grass that inhabits the concrete buildings and roads. However, with that said, there’s still a problem with the consistency of the character art designs to the world’s art design. When you look at the characters, they look like they belong in your typical high-school anime with their sleek, clean looks and schoolgirl outfits. If they were to be taken seriously as consistent designs, I’d imagine them not being the glamorous, pretty girls that they are if they indeed lived in this sort of environment for so long. Not only does it not fit very well in a post-apocalyptic setting because of its distracting nature but it also doesn’t fit well with the tone of the show. It would be like if you watched a movie set in the Middle Ages during the Black Plague era and everyone else looked like they were Animation does fair a bit more than the consistent artwork, but there’s always these constant awful CGI techniques used throughout with the vehicles and fight scenes.<br />
<br />
To start this straightforward construction of the huge points of the show’s problems is, of course, the writing. Following a 1st person narrative from the eyes of the three girls, the show follows several plot arcs where we meet certain groups of people who are trying to survive out in the nuclear wasteland of Tokyo. However, if you’re expecting something that is a similar type of story of say Mushishi, you’re going to be sorely disappointed with this. The characters we meet hardly get any deep characterization and the ones that do come across as lazy cliches that become predictable and unfortunately delves into bland melodrama that comes across as laughable than anything else.<br />
<br />
What does kill the show overall comes from the erratic pacing that goes on. From left and right, characters crop up in many places with each continuing episode that have their agendas and personal vendettas to others. With a show that is only 13 episodes, something like this could’ve worked in a much longer season. Because of this, the pacing regularly suffers immensely in hopes of moving things forward without putting a lot of the plot points into clarification to the audience that might have the trouble of what the main plot is even supposed to be besides just three girls walking through point A to point B in a post-apocalyptic setting. One episode they are desperate on finding this granny that they’ve been building up on a lot and then in the next episode the granny character is not spoken of ever again and they move on into a new mission. Almost as if these certain events don’t feel connected whatsoever very well that cripples the world-building as a whole. When it finally does get to that specific point where you do see where the plot is trying to go, it doesn’t really go anywhere and by the end you almost can’t really feel any emotional impact from the constant cliffhangers that are thrown out there because of how there’s little development to the story and characters.<br />
<br />
Very few characters make a considerable impression apart from the main characters, but even they suffer the same fate of being bland and stereotypical. Only Ibara Naruse seems to have a brain in her head while the rest of the girls seem only to have screaming and whining as their only two reactions and become more like cheerleaders for Naruse most of the time. They even sometimes screw up certain things that almost jeopardize their whole operation, to which begs the question of how they even got the job of being these operatives in the first place. If anything, they come across as mere mindless pawns that don’t offer anything other than pure annoying schoolgirl service that isn’t charming or funny in the slightest because of their out-of-place nature.<br />
<br />
There are even a lot of logical inconsistencies that can’t be taken with a grain of salt in some of the action scenes, such as breaking the laws of physics. In some action shows these kinds of problems can be ignored because of their outlandish nature of defying physics just for the sake of convenience but Coppelion is portraying itself as a realistic setting. You can’t just toss out these laws to see pretty action sequences because it will go against odds with the show’s naturalistic atmosphere and we won’t be able to take it seriously as we did in the beginning. Examples include: 1) People can survive a rocket launcher’s back blast from inside a building. 2) Someone can survive from an anesthetic bullet from at close range even though a bullet of any kind can still kill a person at that range. 3) How can someone survive from a shell exploding in front of them even at medium range? None of which are given any context whatsoever due to the hack directing.<br />
<br />
With all of that aside, the antagonists that they face don’t come across as anything memorable in the slightest. Not even the Ozu sisters, with their very eccentric personalities. The main antagonists’ reasons for trying to take over Coppelion aren’t given enough context, so we don’t even get enough out of them whether we are supposed to be sympathetic or hate them for their reasoning for doing the things they do. In reality, they really don’t have much a reason to have a response to other than the fact that they are just evil people because they’re just evil and whatever reasons that the show had written for them felt muddled and contrived. Their archetypes are the typical big bad government organization that just want to rule over the landscape so they can gain control over Tokyo, just like every other story like it.<br />
<br />
I never thought I would say this, but Aoi would be the first character in an anime that is voiced by Kana Hanazawa that I constantly couldn’t stand at all just from her voice alone. Normally Hanazawa can pull off a good performance, even when her characters aren’t exactly likable. But with her character Aoi, there’s absolutely no positive outcome to her performance from the fact that the only tone her voice that she seems to put into Aoi is high-pitched whining. The other cast members don’t stand out either but they are at least listenable unlike for poor little Hanazawa. For the music aspect, for what little stand out songs there are for the show itself, the opening and ending songs are okay songs that do fit somewhat to Coppelion’s setting with nice dark guitar tones in the opening by the band Angela.<br />
<br />
Calling Coppelion an abject failure would be taking it lightly. It could’ve been a solid show to be experienced if there wasn’t the atrocious pacing, badly developed characters, and horrible melodrama underneath it all but we could’ve only hoped that it would be entertaining from a funny standpoint. Once it stops being funny and steps into mind-numbing boring territory, that’s where the entertainment stops and the dull mediocrity sets in. I’d rather watch a show be entertainingly bad than to be boring and this managed to do both. To this, I must now let Coppelion sit on the throne as one of the most disappointing failures of the year, if there was ever a throne to ever exist in the first place.<br />

    Coppelion can be summed up as disappointing. <br />
<br />
This is because it has an alluring premise: a derelict city scarred by nuclear disaster, overrun by wilderness with a few human survivors scattered about. There&#039;s plenty interesting about a setting like this, and Go Hands does such a great job on the scenery porn that I am currently using a rotating cycle of background shots from the show as my wallpaper.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the characters who populate that setting are not interesting, nor is anything they do. The writing for this show is crap, plain and simple. Setting aside the issue of the Coppelion being teenage girls (standard anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130579">
        conceit), the whole Coppelion project seems half-assed and directionless with no clear goals despite the apparently huge amount of time and money spent on developing these super humans. Ibara&#039;s unit stumbles blindly from one rescue to the next with no plan besides wandering the ruins of Tokyo with a magic Geiger counter that mysteriously led them to humans or sometimes to animals, as the plot required. Virtually every &quot;mission&quot; they acquire is something cobbled together at the moment, a response to some random survivor&#039;s plight. But I&#039;ve watched shows with worse plots (or no real plot at all) and enjoyed them. What keeps that from happening here is a dearth of likable characters.<br />
<br />
Let me start out by saying I liked the Coppelion girls at first. I liked Ibara&#039;s tough compassion and Aoi was adorable. Taeko didn&#039;t stand out much, but that ended up helping my opinion of her in the long run, since I came to greatly dislike both Ibara and Aoi by the end of the series. I found Ibara&#039;s compassion to be a very sympathetic trait in the beginning, when it was directed toward the truly pitiable and desperate, but it became grating as the series wore on and she indiscriminately bestowed compassion on even the most psychotic people she encountered. It just didn&#039;t sit right with me, it made her seem naive and a supremely bad judge of character. She is not a pacifist, she can&#039;t pull off the Jesus thing, so her compassion seems arbitrary and forced when it comes to sparing the lives of homicidal lunatics. Aoi is less a hypocrite and more useless baggage. Her shining moment of the series is running away from people who bullied her in school. I wish I was exaggerating here, but I&#039;m not. To be sure the show tries to dress it up as something heroic, but Aoi is a hysterical coward to the very end. Taeko at the least shows some grit playing the mid wife, though most of it is skipped over in favor of Aoi and Ibara using non-lethal violence against homicidal lunatics.<br />
<br />
And a word about these lunatics: even these characters are not satisfying because they are none of them committed to their goals. Virtually every antagonist except for the shadowy foreign waste disposal companies is redeemed by episode 13, and that whole subplot about the waste dumping was forgotten halfway through the season. <br />
<br />
So nobody in this series is really interesting. They lack conviction. Not the antagonists or the protagonists. The people rescued either gratefully go along or die. I lost track of how many times a side character took off their mask dramatically and then had a tearful goodbye, I imagine their deaths were to make a point about being the only characters in the show with an ounce of conviction in their beliefs. And lord were there tears. Ibara&#039;s toughness is apparently only skin deep, because she cries almost every episode. She cries when a person she just met dies, she cries when a person she just met leaves the city, she cries because something vaguely sad was just told to her. Aoi is even more emotional, but on her it works and doesn&#039;t seem to conflict with any of her other traits. She&#039;s a hysterical coward, so crying over every little thing is practically her job description, it&#039;s honest of her. <br />
<br />
The wishy-washy, directionless writing aside, the show is technically mediocre. The one redeeming factor is the art assets, which are fantastic. The animation is mediocre and the sound is poor. The music was forgettable, the main problem I had with the sound were the effects used for various weaponry, which were jarringly bad, and I&#039;m nothing close to an expert on military weapons. <br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to anybody who&#039;s got better things to be doing. Backlog it for a particularly boring stretch of time off if you think I&#039;m exaggerating.

    Coppelion is an anime about a girl crying, more crying, getting kidnapped, even more crying and then later break down and do nothing.<br />
<br />
Seriously! All is there to the anime is hearing some lame ass character whine and bitch about everything. <br />
<br />
Besides having a girl who cry throughout the whole anime, the action scenes are all replaced by a single art showing either the characters getting punched in the face or jumping. <br />
<br />
To sum it up, It&#039;s Shit.

    Ok, so another anime has ended, somehow I get the feeling that the writer of this anime&#039;s manga version, Tomonori Inoue seems to be a clairvoyant, though the Fukushima nuclear disaster did happen 3 years since the writer conceptualize the possibility of where the scenarios were similar, except of course in his version the nuke contamination was widespread that it covers the so called old capital, while the one that happen in Fukushima Prefecture was only limited in its area. But, anyways, I still give this anime a benefit of a doubt, surly there is something in this anime that basically annoys me, so leave

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125559">
        it to them Japanese to think of something possible and make a lot fancy, co&#039;z frankly this anime has a lot of fancy in it. So I hereby present my ratings for this anime:<br />
<br />
<br />
Story- good 7.<br />
<br />
I like the plot where it involves a similar scenario of that from Fukushima Prefecture, and yes I&#039;m referring to the nuclear plant whose one of it reactor exploded causing most of its area within the 20 km zone to be contaminated with nuclear debris, I also like the melodramatic thing that happens within the plot, but, I cannot fathom the part where there is action involve where the main task of the 3 girls have to face some adversary when they where just suppose to be in a salvage mission to look for survivors. <br />
<br />
Art- pathetic 1.<br />
<br />
Ok, the background, that I have no comment, but them Coppelions in school uniform out in a salvage mission??????AH! It is as worse as going to a formal gathering in a bikini, wtf was this writer, Tomonori Inoue thinking?!Geeez, they&#039;re in a salvage mission, at least  writer Tomonori Inoue-san  could have at least made them wore fatigues uniforms, and if he wants to maintain that moe thing, he could have them girls wore cargo short shorts, with matching long socks and hiking boots, in fact I&#039;m thinking of the same attire that Lara Croft of Tomb Raider would wear except with a bit of Japanese theme in it, where it would have been more appropriate for them girls. Haruto on the other hand would have looked good if he be wearing the same uniform that the JGSDF would, also there is the HAZMAT suits, where it kinda looks more like a space suit than a Hazmat, which was a clear indication that when the illustrator did such illustration he probably didn&#039;t do his research well, and let&#039;s not forget the Division 1 people, who dresses like they are members of the NAZI. I hate to say it but the character&#039;s attires are just too way fancy. What&#039;s even more bad was that I don&#039;t get to see any panty shot or some uncensored boob flashes. <br />
<br />
Sound- Decent 4.<br />
<br />
I just don&#039;t have anything to say about the seiyuu&#039;s who did the character&#039;s voices, except that I like the closing theme.<br />
<br />
Character- fair 6.<br />
<br />
 I kinda like Ibara Naruse&#039;s character as this head strong leader of the trio with a heart, but I kinda have some reservations about her being too dedicated in saving lives that sometime she endangers her team.<br />
<br />
Aoi Fukasaku, was some what of a character, where at one point I like her sweetness, but I despises her indecisiveness, I also hate the fact that she can only use her powers on a limited basis.<br />
<br />
Taeko Nomura, she more like a dichotomy, where at one point she has medical training, but kinda paralyze by her hesitation to deliver Ibuki&#039;s twins.<br />
<br />
Ozu sisters- They would have been the character&#039;s I like to hate, but somehow on the last episode, they seems to be a nice duet, not bad for having a DNA taken from a psychopath.<br />
<br />
Haruto, well I like the part where he really did play out as a hero who gave his life, that is if he is still alive.<br />
<br />
Ok, so we all know that the main character&#039;s here are them Coppelions, it was nice to know the way they perform, but I just can&#039;t fathom the possibility that in this anime/manga the Japanese govt spends a lot of  money to make an artificial enhance humanoid, like a Coppelion, just as so that they can send them on a salvage mission where it would have been much cheaper to make a more effective Hazmat suit. So, despite of the performance I guess for this part should be.. fair enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- good 7.<br />
<br />
What is enjoyable were the melodrama and the action, and that&#039;s this anime&#039;s silver lining which is good enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall- Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Despite of the all things fancy in this anime, and the exaggerations, it was still good, but, for me the action and the melodrama wasn&#039;t enough to convince me to give this anime a score higher than 6, frankly because I really can&#039;t fathom all the fancy things and the exaggerations that this anime exhibits.

    Alright so I haven&#039;t read manga so I can&#039;t compare it . But Coppelion for me had a beautiful idea. The main characters were girls which were saving people around the world. What was the problem? They weren&#039;t human. I really enjoyed watching how their characters were growing. This anime showed me beautiful power of friendship and also that it is possible to do anything if you want to. I&#039;m not a big fan of this genre but Coppelion really made me cry.

    Coppelion follows a group of high school age girls, known by the same name as the title, as they wander around the abandoned and contaminated former capital of Japan, Tokyo. After an accident several decades ago caused the entire city to be filled with radiation and become unfit for human life, a project was started to create genetically enhanced humans who could survive in the toxic conditions.<br />
<br />
The story of the anime follows about a handful of arcs ranging from around one to five episodes each. The arcs all involve the protagonists meeting some stranded people they have to save them by protecting them until a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125623">
        helicopter can arrive (which always seems to come as late as possible). The people who manage to survive have special hazmat suits that can keep out radiation to a certain extent, but there is always some other complication that makes saving the people more difficult.<br />
<br />
I was expecting to enjoy Coppelion when I first read about it and saw a preview video. The animation is similar to K Project (meaning that every scene contains at least four or five colors of the rainbow and everything else on the spectrum in between) except set in world that looks like it was taken out of Call of Duty. The show started off well enough but eventually collapsed in on itself as the characters failed to develop, the story became repetitive, and the animation budget apparently ran low towards the end.<br />
<br />
The main characters are three girls named Ibara, Aoi, and Taeko. Ibara is the brave leader who does all the action and keeps the other two in line. She was the class president back at their school while they were in training as Coppelion and is one of those characters that decides she has to save everyone even if they are constantly trying to kill her and everyone else. Aoi ends up being just an annoying damsel-in-distress who only does about two useful things throughout the anime as well as becoming an even less useful recluse for a while. Taeko is hardly even noticeable and performs most of her big acts of helping non-Coppelion humans off-screen. There are also a few minor characters in each arc. Most of them are humans who need rescuing (which is what the girls&#039; job is) as well as three other Coppelion who have most of their traits spoiled by the OP&#039;s animation. The villains in the show are only there for the purpose of making things more difficult for the protagonists and are very generic with poor motivations.<br />
<br />
The animation is interesting to say the least. While some scenes have way more colors than necessary, many are just astonishingly vivid and make the city filled with radiation look like you would expect (especially when there are sunsets). However, the show gets carried away with using too much blue/green in some shots even where there isn&#039;t any radiation and it just gets overused and honestly looks kind of gross. The action scenes later on also get very lazy. Many times you&#039;ll see someone start to punch and then see its conclusion with the actual action not being shown (this applies to many more things than just punches of course) as well as many shots that look like nothing more than a gif. All of the Coppelion have almost the exact same face as well as the same school uniform with some minor adjustments to them. A few of the minors characters also look similar. The soundtrack has some issues with being played a little too loud in comparison to the speaking at times, but it still manages to fit with the action at other times. Otherwise though, the soundtrack is hardly noticeable.<br />
<br />
Story -- 3/10 (I really dislike the overused &quot;Save the pregnant woman&quot; plot point)<br />
Animation -- 4/10<br />
Soundtrack -- 3/10<br />
Character -- 2/10<br />
Enjoyment -- 3/10<br />
<br />
Coppelion really had a chance to be good, but it just utterly failed in every way. The few aspects that initially seemed good disappeared as the budget disappeared. The characters which started off bad, stayed bad and Aoi just got worse. Most of the minor characters had too short of screen times for the viewer to connect with them the same way the protagonists did and in the final arc, where there was enough time, the villains were horrible and ruined any chance it had of picking itself up. The story just goes nowhere with little development in between the arcs and ends in an unsatisfying way.

    Coppelion follows the rescue unit on their journey through post apocalyptic Tokyo. Are main characters are Ibara Naruse, Aoi Fukasaku and Taeko Nomura. These three girls are not exactly ordinary as they are artificial clones created to withstand massive doses of nuclear radiation and they possess their own special perks such as speed, super strength and even the ability to create electricity. Ibara has super strength, enhanced athletic abilities and she’s very accurate with a gun. (Though rarely uses it to harm others) Aoi… Can’t do a thing as she has no special perks or abilities and I just presumed that she was a prototype

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130075">
        until latter episodes. Finally we have Taeko who has heightened senses such as eyesight and hearing and has the ability to communicate with animals. The rescue unit’s job is to find any remaining survivors from the calamity that was a nuclear meltdown and get them to safety away from apocalyptic Tokyo, whilst dealing with rogue Coppelion units, dangerous civilians and disturbed military forces.<br />
<br />
This anime came out in fall 2013 and I was anticipating this anime the most along with Kill la Kill, since I am a fan of apocalyptic settings brought upon by man itself, I was hoping to get a really good and well developed story. Did Coppelion match up to my expectations? Well let’s explore this in a bit of detail.<br />
<br />
The story seems very straight forward, find and rescue all the survivors left in Tokyo, but from the first story arc in the series it doesn&#039;t seem to go all that smooth as a couple of them die sacrificing their lives for others, but it did seem very unnecessary, if they didn&#039;t panic and freak out everyone would have lived happily ever after. It did occur to me that not everyone can be saved from themselves and their inner demons. So after that start the series eventually goes on about discovering the reasons behind people staying in Tokyo because of guilt, unfinished business, fear and leaving without someone you love and seeing if they can be saved by the rescue unit.  <br />
<br />
The characters in this show are somewhat mixed, we have Ibara who is the leader and role model to the other two main characters she is the authority figure in the show who wants to help and save everyone she can as Ibara feels that she has no purpose for being created if she cannot do so. Aoi is the cute, ditsy and useless girl amongst the trio. She pretty much is a spectator for the majority of the show and when times get tough she steps up and locks herself in a room as Aoi feels like she is dragging down the rest. Later on in the series she gathers enough courage to help out after some inspiring words from an android called Nosense.The final 1/3 of the group is Taeko who is the lesser focussed member of the group. Taeko is very brave and straightforward and always does whatever she can to save others around her using the methods taught to her in school<br />
<br />
Other mentionable characters include the Vice principle Onihei Mishima who cares about the safety of civilians left in Tokyo and even cares about the Coppelion rescue unit. We also have the only male Coppelion in the series Haruto Kurosawa who is a member of the clean up crew. Haruto is skilled with making bombs and is a good shot. At first Haruto makes his dislike of humans known to us, but he eventually learns to co-exist with others. Next we have the first of the Ozu sisters Kanon Ozu (I forgot to mention that Coppelion are clones of pre-existing humans) she is a clone of a psychotic serial killer; her power is the ability to conjure up electricity. Kanon has a deep hatred for humans (which you will discover the reasons why later on in the series) and works with other forces in order to bring about the end of humanity. Shion Ozu the second of the Ozu sisters is a very childish and sadistic girl who also carries a grudge against humanity. Her powers include super strength. She also carries the serial killer genes of her human counterpart.<br />

I couldn&#039;t find the OST anywhere so I&#039;ll go with the sound what i can remember the opening theme tune is very good and i personally didn&#039;t want to skip the intro as it is a treat for the eyes too. The ending track is also very likeable. The animation was very good, at first i was a bit surprised with the thick pencil outline on the characters but i forgot about over the course of time.<br />
<br />
What was bad about this anime was how it appeared that the producers wouldn&#039;t be afraid to kill off characters at the beginning then decided to chicken out and everyone comes out unscathed. The characters that did die seemed expendable if anything. (Granted it was only one or two characters)<br />
<br />
(This could be a spoiler so be warned) Near the end of the series there was a giant robotic spider… yeah. A rogue military leader controlled this gigantic spider machine that shot rockets and some other shit… The fight scene with said spider-bot was ridiculous and it felt like it was thrown in purely for the sake of having a giant spider-bot. I can’t even begin to imagine how much time and money would go into making that thing, and for what reason or cause. <br />
<br />
The dialogue could have been better in some places such as Ibara’s hard to watch pleads to those trying to cause trouble or to the civilians that refused to leave Tokyo. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d also like to give a shout out to the android Nosense who teaches us that regardless of whether or not he is human that he has feelings and emotions. <br />
<br />
Overall Coppelion was a bit of a disappointment. I did like the show but after watching the first three episodes I was disappointed with how the rest of the series turned out. Characters can be hit or miss at times like Aoi who can be adorable but also very idiotic and insufferable, Ibara who is brave and courageous but when she went to the ground and pleaded with tears pouring from her eyes it was very pitiful. The story can be very absurd at times but I enjoyed this enough to continue to the end. Although I did enjoy the series I would not personally recommend this, I’d say give the first few episodes a try at least.

    So I first heard about Coppelion through Kotaku&#039;s anime preview list, and the premise intrigued me. Then, as the series went on, on CrunchyRoll there were a lot of people who thought this was one the most disappointing anime they&#039;ve ever seen, and how it&#039;s pretty darn bad. Note: I have never read the original manga material, so I do not know how the anime compares to that, so I&#039;ll be reviewing the anime on its own.<br />
<br />
Well, I disagree. First, let&#039;s talk about the goods.<br />
1) The artwork and style is truly fantastic. The characters pop, details are easily visualized on screen, and it has that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review129939">
        grey-ish filter that makes everything look post-apocalyptic. When we get to a change of green scenery, the viewer can definitely see a drastic difference between what&#039;s been damaged by the nuclear incident and what nature has done to repair itself.<br />
2) I really enjoy the OP and ED by Angela. The voice actors and actresses all do a pretty good job portraying their respective characters too.<br />
3) The pacing is pretty good. Each episode always ends in excitement, so at least for me, I was excited to next week&#039;s episode.<br />
4) Story is acceptable for what&#039;s going on. I don&#039;t think the anime is portraying itself as being a very realistic and serious series, so the occasional gags and jokes aren&#039;t out of place in my opinion. Others however, thought the opposite. Some think there&#039;s too many illogical instances that go in stark contrast to what the anime is trying to portray.<br />
<br />
What I didn&#039;t like<br />
1) Characters don&#039;t really develop throughout the series. Nearly everybody is one-dimensional (at least until the climax), and some viewers may find Aoi really annoying. But, I think she was funny and cute. On the contrast, if people have seen Anohana, I thought Menma was much more annoying than Aoi. <br />
2) As a result of the characters not really developing, the viewer doesn&#039;t really connect emotionally to the characters, especially when things, both good or bad, happen to them.<br />
3) Story could have been done better with a tighter script, but this is a minor fault.<br />
<br />
So overall, I enjoyed this anime. Therefore I&#039;d give it a 7/10. It&#039;s not a masterpiece by any means, but I enjoyed it through and through, and would definitely watch season 2 if that were to ever come out.

    When I read the other reviews for Copellion, I thought this might be bad, but it was actually the opposite.<br />
<br />
Story is great, I can&#039;t give any other info on that. Too important to spoil.<br />
<br />
Art was amazing, but the fact that the characters kinda stand out in comparison to the scenery was a bit of an issue that kept catching my attention.<br />
<br />
Sound was wonderful, and the SFX was nice.<br />
<br />
Characters were nice, wish they could&#039;ve elaborated more on the girl&#039;s backstories, but I&#039;m content.<br />
<br />
Enjoyed this enough to give it a 9, don&#039;t let the other reviews discourage you.<br />
<br />
Overall, a definite 10.

    Coppelion. The demise of the fall season of 2014 is how I see this show.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t try to sugarcoat anything and I&#039;ll just get straight to the point. This anime hardly has any assets if any at all. You are in for an incredibly dull experience if you&#039;re going to attempt to watch Coppelion and I&#039;m even surprised I sticked with it until the end.<br />
<br />
Starting with the story. Awfully boring, mediocre and generic. Nothing stood out about this story which sort of promised something in the beginning but just slowly crumbled appart after. The setting is within Japan&#039;s now wrecked capital which was caused by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125551">
        a nuclear accident in the past. Nothing too bad here it could be interesting to see a post nuclear setting. Then we are introduced to the 3 main highschool girls who are coming into this nuclear warzone to save the people trapped (oh boy highschool girls do anything these days!). But these girls are not your average highschool student, they are Coppelion. Genetically modified organisms with natural resistance to radioactivity and with some sort of natural ability unique to each of them. They were trained by the military to go into the radioactive city and save people left behind there after said nuclear accident. Will they be able to make it? How will these girls with no parents endure such a tough journey through out this deserted city? Well by whining about it of course!<br />
<br />
The characters in Coppelion are some of the most pathetic excuses of existence I have ever witnessed in an Anime. They are god awful, every single one of them including the protagonist Naruse. I&#039;ll sum up the main characters with one word. Aoi the crybaby, Taeko the clueless and Naruse the naive. These girls together barely do anything productive through out the whole series and they will constantly annoy you with whining. Aoi in particular spends literally half of the show, crying, not knowing what to do, sitting in the corner of a room thinking she&#039;s worthless. Taeko barely has any screentime but when she does all she can manage is to rely on Naruse and when she&#039;s alone all she can think of is how she&#039;ll fail. And then our protagonist Ibara Naruse is your typical mediocre naive character that thinks every human being in existence is kind and tries to save everyone and everything by getting abducted and getting taken out by all the enemies, good job!<br />
<br />
The characters are weak and not memorable at all. They all have some sort of ability but this is hardly ever shown! Taeko uses her ability twice in the whole series, Aoi uses it once and I don&#039;t even know what Naruse&#039;s ability is even! And not to mention these &quot;abilities&quot; are god awful and unoriginal. One of the antagonists that appears later on feels like a blatant rip off of Misaka Mikoto from the Toaru series, it&#039;s not even funny anymore I just wanted to say &quot;please stop&quot; while watching these episodes. The only single character I actually sort of enjoyed was one of the guys named Haruto which actually did something and did not whine and he who deserved the most respect got treated very poorly by this series.<br />
<br />
So you&#039;re probably wondering what do these girls do the entire time. Save lives? God no! There were countless times where they tried to save someone and another person ended up dying inthe process because either one of the 2 main girls was crying and running around helpless or because the protagonist Naruse is an incompetent naive individual who can not deal with any situation properly and with a cool mind. This happens  with every little group they rescue (which is only 3 groups in the entire show). <br />
<br />
What surprised me the most is there&#039;s actual antagonists who are trying to stop this girls from &quot;rescuing&quot; people. Even though they were doing a fine job at failing already by themselves. Thes antagonists are the previous military force that existed prior to the nuclear accident and was left behind. They intend to drown the world in radioactivity because they were left alone all this time. Talk about being sore losers. Because leaving the town with their jeeps and tanks is completely out of the question, there&#039;s no way they could do that, they have to carefully craft a plan to destroy the world for leaving them there. My final veridict on the story is that it&#039;s badly constructed, meaningless, not memorable and there&#039;s plot holes all over the palce since you barely even know what happened in the past although you do get some flashbacks here and there.<br />
<br />
Now that I&#039;m done talking about the worst this series has I&#039;ll move on to the less bad but still pretty poor. The art. The art was incredibly dull and boring. Nothing and I mean nothing stood out. The colors were all the same, it&#039;s like they were lazy and didn&#039;t feel like coloring anything properly. I&#039;m not sure if they tried going for a sort of rusty/radioactive feel but it simply is not working. I&#039;d prefer seeing actual colored wrecked buildings and grass as opposed to having everything blending in together. It&#039;s like you&#039;re trapped in a closed room where all the walls are white and there&#039;s no furniture in there. This on top of the characters which I&#039;m almost sure are some sort of stick figures where the outlines were drawn with a permanent marker. They&#039;re just bad and they&#039;re poorly executed and sloppy.<br />
<br />
Is this review going to keep getting worse? Well I didn&#039;t rate it 1 out of 1 because there was something good about it. I liked the intro and the ending songs. The OST was mediocre but not bad which made me appreciate the anime a bit more but that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
Overall Coppelion was a poorly executed anime and is not worth the time it takes to watch its 13 episdes. Should you watch it? Absolutely not unless you want an incredibly dull experience with crappy cliffhangers that just make you say &quot;Ugh it still continues&quot; instead of &quot;God I need to know what happens now!&quot;. There&#039;s nothing enjoyable about this series in its essence. I pointed out the OST but the OST is not what makes an entire series obviously. Somewhat interesting setting but very weak characters and weak story. This is not worth your time.

    Coppelion was part of my summer anime viewing a couple years ago. Alongside BlazBlue: Alter Memory and Kill la KIll I can&#039;t quite recall right now, it really had potential to go places in 13 episodes. Unfortunately, it stumbled by episode 3 and crashed before episode 7. What followed were the charred remains scratching and clawing out of the wreckage that was its plot and begging to be put out of its misery. Is the manga better? Unfortunately, I couldn&#039;t be bothered after this botched attempt.<br />
<br />
Starting where it should be saving itself, the sound is... Meh. The only memorable part of the series was the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192120">
        op despite it having a few okay tracks. You don&#039;t feel anything except sheer boredom when watching and the music doesn&#039;t alleviate this. Part of what makes an anime work is the musical score which someone in the studio behind this mistake forgot about. <br />
<br />
The characters are what you get when someone doesn&#039;t try. Ibara is a bad leader, the General is about as incompetent as military personnel can get, and the rest border on annoyingly stupid (Aoi comes to mind) or psychotic. Nothing about the characters redeems them and even when one sacrifices themselves, you can only feel happy that they were able to get out of this mess. <br />
<br />
The art feels rushed and incomplete, especially when some scenes have thick outlines around the girl as if the animation team said &quot;good enough&quot; and called it a day. Despite some of the visuals being pleasing in places, they&#039;re off-set by the thick outlines or lack of depth to the characters. Oh, but that&#039;s not the worst of it.<br />
<br />
Imagine if Tokyo did go up in flames during that last tsunami a few years ago. What the studio (and mangaka) attempt to create is a post-meltdown Tokyo where people in hazmat suits have somehow survived in a highly-radiated area of the country with only the apparently incompetent Japanese military dudes suffering for it. Hazmat suits are a short-term option when dealing with this kind of stuff and even then they don&#039;t provide 100% protection nor are they immune to degradation. <br />
<br />
None of the story makes sense, the characters are awful, the sound is forgettable, and overall it&#039;s a miss-able series. Miss it.

    Coppelion was a science fiction manga written by Inoue Tomonori from 2008 to the beginning of this year. In late 2013, before the manga had actually ended, there was an anime adaptation by GoHands. Now, I&#039;ve never seen a GoHands anime before, so all I know about Coppelion is what I heard from the young lady who requested that I review it. She called it “hilariously bad.” I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s going to sum up my own feelings on it. So, let&#039;s take a look and see if it is, indeed, hilariously bad.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
After a nuclear accident, Tokyo&#039;s been left a smouldering wreck. Twenty years

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236779">
        after the incident, a group of students, genetically engineered to resist radiation, are sent into the ruins to find survivors and clean the area. These students are the titular Coppelion.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s begin by talking about the flaws with the series, and there are some major ones. First of all, the message of the series. You know how Miyazaki films tend to contain subtle, eloquent environmental messages? Well, Coppelion does the opposite. It has a loud, sanctimonious and ill-conceived message about how terrible radioactive waste build up is and we&#039;re ruining everything. While it is a message that I can get behind, in theory, the presentation here is just really inept. The series also suffers from narrative disconnect with the characters. Supposedly these girls have been trained for this all their lives but they come across as completely and grossly unprepared for the situation. Almost like they&#039;re ordinary teenage girls who were tossed into it after all of a weekend of preparation. It&#039;s also odd that these girls have superhuman abilities, but in the case of one of them they deliberately handicap those. Why would you engineer her to have super powers if you don&#039;t want her to use them? Another of our protagonists doesn&#039;t know how to use hers. You&#039;d think that would be the number one item on the list of training necessities. Show them how to use the super powers they were designed to have. What&#039;s the point of giving them these abilities if they don&#039;t know how to use them? The back story we&#039;re given simply doesn&#039;t mesh with the action on screen. The series also suffers from its share of dumb moments. We&#039;re talking the characters thinking a bomber is a bird and an “epic” chase sequence using paddle boats shaped like swans. Incidentally, those are the only two scenes that are kind of hilarious in how stupid they are.<br />
<br />
The sad part about all this is that the premise itself does have potential. I would be really interested in a competently written series about a group of genetically engineered characters with super powers exploring a radioactive wasteland to achieve a goal. Unfortunately, we didn&#039;t get competence.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve talked about the incongruity between the back story these characters are given and what we see of them on screen. Let me talk about what we see of them specifically for a moment. Our main characters are Ibara, Aoi &amp; Taeko. All three of them are very quick to cry and become emotionally distraught. Which is pretty annoying. So, let me get this straight, the government sent these girls into the field after training them their entire lives, but they couldn&#039;t be bothered to help them build up any mental toughness? They didn&#039;t think they&#039;d encounter anything tragic or potentially upsetting in the radioactive wasteland? They thought it was all going to be rainbows, sunshine and the magic of friendship? Aoi isn&#039;t even aware of what her special powers are, forget about being trained in their use. Taeko has heightened senses and glasses designed to dull her super vision. There are also a couple of antagonistic coppelion with weak motivations. So weak that the ending entirely negates them. It doesn&#039;t help that the characters have no real complexity.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art is one area where I&#039;ll give the series some credit. The backgrounds are really well drawn. The character designs aren&#039;t distinctive, but they look just fine. The biggest problem with the art is that the backgrounds can be really static. There are points where it looks like the characters are standing in front of a static image, albeit a really nice static image. It&#039;s like there are points where GoHands animated the characters and their actions and then put in the same background image for the entirety of the sequence.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
They did get some strong actresses for this. Hanazawa Kana, Tomatsu Haruka, Horie Yui &amp; Sakamoto Maaya all have roles as major protagonists or antagonists. The trouble is that their characters really don&#039;t have much to them. The amount of time the main characters spend whining also really hurts the performances. Which results in acting that&#039;s pretty sub-par. The composer for this series was Endo Mikio and he did a decent job. It&#039;s not a particularly good soundtrack, but it&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
The three major girls cuddle up to one another in the opening theme, but there&#039;s no indication within the series proper that they have any romantic feelings towards one another.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
So, that was Coppelion. Is it bad? It&#039;s not one of the worst anime I&#039;ve seen, but yeah. It&#039;s pretty bad. Is it hilarious? Not really. It has some scenes that are pretty funny in their stupidity. The paddle boat chase is really funny in its absurdity. The characters being too thick to tell a bomber from a bird is pretty funny. But aside from those two specific scenes, it&#039;s not really funny. It&#039;s just bad. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week will be the first review of January and you know what that means. Every review is going to follow a specific theme. We&#039;ve had Hayashibara Megumi, yuri, Ghibli, magical girl and sequel months. This year, it&#039;s all about girls with guns. Next week we&#039;ll kick that off with a look at Gunsmith Cats.

    Oh yes!!!!!!! This is outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (to me) <br />
<br />
This Anime gave me the feels! The OP and ED gave me the feels, and was great!<br />
<br />
I loved the art, it is so nice! I loved the story, and the characters a lot! I imagine myself in this Anime, and I was one of those made people, and I just went out and go to the contaminated place without permission hehehehehhe<br />
<br />
I have no dislikes about this Anime, and still wish for a second season! There is enough material for a second season, I believe. But, I guess this didn&#039;t got much attention, which is sad.<br />
<br />
I recommend this a

    I am back for another review on the anime Coppelion. And what do I think of it? It wasn&#039;t that good. <br />
<br />
STORY (3):<br />
<br />
The story takes place in an abandoned city near Odaibi nuclear power plant when there was a nuclear explosion and the 3 girls who call themselves Coppelion, have their duty to evacuate the remaining survivors of the abandoned city. Coppelion is a team of students who are trained to perform different tasks and they are immune to radiation.<br />
<br />
Now, I was looking forward to the post-traumatic anime both perspectives, but sadly I was let down by the careless writing and plot holes. Also not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125571">
        to mention annoying characters.<br />
I will list down all the technical problems that this anime is suffering from.<br />
<br />
Technical problem #1:<br />
B2 bomber is a Black Crow. The writers really think that B2 Bomber can fly as fast as the birds so they just make it fly together with the birds. Not to mention the B2 Bomber can be used to transport material. It appears that the writers never understand what the design of the plane &quot;B2 Bomber&quot; looked like and its functions. From our observation, we already can tell that this is a B2 Bomber plane. The writer just made it blatantly obvious for us to tell.<br />
<br />
Technical problem #2: (Possible Spoilers)<br />
In episode 2, we only see the after effects of what happened. How did the child managed to be saved? Why is the mother of the child, the only one who fell to her death?<br />
<br />
Technical problem #3:<br />
The main cast refer to the 1st Division as &quot;ghosts&quot;. This means that we can never see them even though it was very obvious for us to see them.<br />
<br />
I can go on all day about the technical problems but I have to preserve my mental health.<br />
<br />
ART (4):<br />
<br />
I am fine with the design style of the anime. They used bold lines and the background is tinted in green when it is sunny.<br />
<br />
SOUND (4):<br />
<br />
I find the ending theme and opening theme all right.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (2):<br />
<br />
How do I describe the characters? That&#039;s simple, just one word &quot;incompetent&quot;. I really didn&#039;t like their attitude. All they do is cry and moan all the time and this sickens me. Let me remind you again, I hate crybabies and I have seen people in anime who really survived through hard times and yet they never cry or moan.<br />
<br />
Aoi, to me is the most annoying character in this anime. All she does is cry and moan all the time. She always makes things from bad to worse. She was the reason why I didn&#039;t enjoy Coppelion. <br />
<br />
Haruto was the only likable character in this anime but he was pushed aside after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION (2):<br />
<br />
It seems that the writers used a lot of puns like refer the giant robot as &quot;Spider&quot; in the last few episodes. In fact, I have mentioned this in previous discussions on each particular episodes. Trying to make us unaware of what is going on, is it? You can&#039;t do that. <br />
<br />
Not only that, I didn&#039;t care about any of the characters in this anime. They were annoying. <br />
<br />
(Possible Spoilers)<br />
The ending shows that the Ozu sisters and the 3 Coppelion girls are left behind in the abandoned city while the survivors are rescued. Why can&#039;t they also be rescued? Why is there only one chopper? Oh, I really think that the 3 Coppelion girls are comfortable in the environment they live in. Or maybe I think that there might be other survivors?<br />
(End of possible Spoilers)<br />
<br />
I really just have nothing more to say. <br />
<br />
Overall, Coppelion could have been an entertaining series but with its inconsistencies, annoying characters and anti-climatic ending, it just killed the enjoyment for me. I&#039;ll give this anime a 2 out of 10.

    After months of contemplating over the series, Coppelion made its final episode on Christmas Day. Here&#039;s my review of Coppelion as a whole series.<br />
<br />
Coppelion welcomed me with very magnificent visuals and an intriguing storyline. Albeit this, my concerns were already popping up. First, the characters seemed out of place from the entire scenery and the audio, is well, sub-par to say the most. However as the episodes go by I started to ignore these cons when the show&#039;s visual and audio department started heading the proper direction.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s main titular characters are mostly composed of high school girls gifted with the ability of being immune

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126417">
        to radioactivity. Sounds cool right? But it doesn&#039;t end there; each Coppelion has their own signature ability, i.e. Ibara&#039;s superhuman reflexes and (SPOILER ALERT!) Aoi&#039;s shielding ability. However I was greatly disturbed by how emotional these female characters are and how annoying Aoi&#039;s childish personality can be. I was also skeptical about how the female characters were dressed. Their school uniform with their thin skirts are - for me - not the most ideal clothing in a rescue mission. But instead their outfits are mainly for fan-service. Even fan-service has its moments but in Coppelion, they don&#039;t seem to be a very welcoming sight.<br />
<br />
On later episodes, more and more characters are introduced, both members of the Coppelion and not-so ordinary humans. The series&#039; plot tells on the Coppelion rescuing human settlers on the radioactive city on Tokyo, which was achieved near the show&#039;s ending and just as I was bashing the show for no direction in the storytelling. But luckily that wasn&#039;t the case until the show&#039;s mid-season episodes up to the last. <br />
<br />
Battle scenes were greatly depicted and I was impressed that the armaments used in the fray weren&#039;t so futuristic - well, except for the giant metallic spider. <br />
<br />
I was also happy about how each character gets an equal and reasonable amount of screentime. Not that you would care for each of the characters well-being but oh well...<br />
<br />
Finally, the show also greatly emphasizes on friendship and moral judgement. A very mushy topic for a genre like this but works quite well if you&#039;re fed up with the gung-ho.<br />
<br />
In conclusion Coppelion isn&#039;t an anime suited for most but it&#039;s still a watchable show. You may hate the story, the presentation, or characters (specifically, I hated Aoi the most at first), that still doesn&#039;t stop the show from airing to a specific audience. Coppelion doesn&#039;t need to try hard to become the no. 1 anime of the season but as a show that would please viewers with its own version of content. And if a second season were to air, I would gladly put that show in my watchlist.<br />
<br />

    In this post-apocalyptic nuclear melt own scenario there are bunch of special kids who are resistant to any amount of radiation. They are made to help and rescue people (anyone who is still alive) in this radiation contaminated area. How these kids feel and how they work to save people forms the story. Now the plot is not bad initially but it does not develop from there. Characters are not at all developed from the first to the last episode. It seems they have some issue with them, all these special kids i.e., Coppelions, but its never told out. Only one thing is revealed. The

    At this point Go Hands has lost all credibility as a new animation studio. They have amazing production values to offer a level of eye candy very few are capable of, and they are always wasting it on subpar titles that offer nothing besides cool premises and lots of fan service (Seitokai Yakuindomo, Mardock Scramble, K Project). Their latest work of bad art is this Coppelion, which is about some schoolgirls looking for survivors in a radioactive area of Japan. Many were mesmerized by the very good animation and artwork, which was creating a most creepy post-apocalyptic setting and thought it would be a very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319002">
        mature and thought-provoking series.<br />
<br />
Me? Just looking at the premise I knew right away it will be a big failure. I mean, SCHOOLGIRLS IN THE ROLE OF RESCUE RANGERS! How much more obvious could it be to smell the BS from ten miles away? Something about the voice actors being amazing, or that they delayed the creation of this show for a year because of that tsunami that struck Japan, so it has to be great for having all this time to work on it. If you ask me, they should have canceled it the second someone proposed the idea of actually making a show out of this anecdote of a premise.<br />
<br />
Oh, but wait, maybe I was just being too biased and the show is actually good! Maybe they actually did something with the premise later on and I was wrong to condemn it immediately! So what if we have schoolgirls instead of properly trained military personnel sent to do these rescue missions? This way we will have far more emotional responses out of them and each mission will be more about survival/horror than just guns blazing.<br />
<br />
… Nope, the obvious failure was obvious after all. All these attempts to make the series more “humane” as some hoped it would be, ended up being its undoing. You think there is any other reason than fan service for these girls to be sent in school uniforms and not proper military uniforms?<br />
<br />
“Maybe this way the survivors will find them cute and trust them easier than if they were scary looking soldiers.”<br />
<br />
… Nope, it was the usual bullshit that plagues modern anime and nothing else.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, there is definitely a lot more going on that this. The girls are not normal! They are immune to radiation, and their skin is very pale, and they are probably part of some sinister human experiment.”<br />
<br />
Even if they are, does it even mean anything? All we see them doing is acting completely inappropriately for the mission they have, like typical immature schoolgirls instead of the specially bred and trained super soldiers they are supposed to be. The whole mystery and conspiracy theories are just background noise if all we see is that nonsense. There is absolutely no immersion to the themes of the story. Something about being treated as objects and not as people? Who cares? Not even the girls do; they cry for a few minutes and then forget it and move on before they remember they have to cry again about it. It would be lovely if they were actually doing something about it, but no, it all amounts to ephemeral mood swings. Said mood swings just come out of nowhere and there is no time invested on their doll issue. Even if you get a gasping revelation later on, you just don’t give a damn because you were never made to take anything seriously. And the worst part is how the series is not supposed to be comedy but a sociopolitical drama.<br />
<br />
“Well, at least the girls are cute this way and not some uninteresting military brutes. And you must keep in mind how they don’t have radiation-immune adult soldiers yet, and they were forced to send these teenage girls who are at a very sensitive age. It is normal for them to be acting a bit emotional and not following orders.”<br />
<br />
Whatever, all I see is inappropriately behaving (and dressed) people sent to the wrong mission. All that fuss about they have no time to send others or that the government is pressuring the military to take action, or that thousands may die if they don’t act now, THEY MEAN NOTHING! I can’t take it seriously! I mean can you imagine a news reporter trying to describe this situation without laughing his ass off? And it’s also supposed to be a serious situation!<br />
<br />
Even if you don’t mind the ludicrous plot, you can’t even enjoy it for the characters. Not only is the characterization bare bones, not only you are facepalming with the way the heroines are dressed, not only you are cringing your teeth every time they cry for close to no reason (that is, all the time), but you are also left with essentially ONE girl doing all the work, while the other two are just crying in a corner, or eat rice cakes and comment on how pretty the lake looks. There aren’t even any other interesting secondary characters to take notice; most disappear after a single episode. Throw in some plot twists that make no sense, such as creating rescue rangers out of clones of psychotic mass murderers, and huge mecha hiding inside a city. Why did they throw such thing in there? Because it would make things more interesting, and not because it makes sense whatsoever. And as always YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE ALL THAT SERIOUSLY!<br />
<br />
Well, I can’t. I couldn’t do it ever since I saw the entry picture and red the synopsis of the story. And so should anyone who even attempts to watch it.

    I really wanted to like Coppelion, storywise it had a lot of potential, but an onslaught of problems coming from the direction, the writing, the pacing, and the animation from the anime itself really held it back from being anything but &quot;...eh..&quot; <br />
<br />
Coppelion is directed by Shingo Suzuki. It&#039;s about three high school students who are genetically altered to be immune to radioactivity in Tokyo after it&#039;s contaminated by a nuclear accident. The Coppelion are sent in by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force to rescue the people still living in the city after a distress signal from inside Tokyo is received. <br />
<br />
The anime started off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205516">
        strong with nice backgrounds, nice colors and a really nice setting... that is until we see the characters. The characters themselves don&#039;t mesh well with the backgrounds whatsoever. They have really thick outlines at times and don&#039;t seem to fit into this world. The backgrounds remind me of more vibrant and realistic styles of anime like Paprika, Children Who Chase Lost voices, or something Studio Ghibli with the detailed backgrounds, but the characters are cheaply drawn, poorly animated and are drab and almost devoid of any color due to an annoying color overlay that washes out any vibrant colors onscreen.<br />
<br />
I started the first episode and was bothered already by the thick outlined cheap looking characters that I almost stopped watching after 5 minutes. I pushed through and actually found myself getting into the story and got used to the design choices for the most part, and the characters didn&#039;t look too bad to me anymore. But after the first 5 or 6 episodes, the plot really slows and gets convoluted. There&#039;s a lot of pacing issues and it made the anime hard to watch and kind of boring at times. <br />
<br />
The last 2 episodes were really solid and I do think if the pacing throughout the entirety of the anime was more like this it would&#039;ve been a much more enjoyably experience. It definitely wasn&#039;t all bad, especially since I did have a smile on my face at the end of the 13th episode, so if you can get passed the problems, you might find this anime rather enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I do like the story, it&#039;s an interesting concept, and I did enjoy parts of the anime a lot, but the execution of the anime itself was so poorly done that I&#039;d recommend not watching it and just reading the manga, which is still going today.<br />
<br />
Which is why I have to give it a 6/10
